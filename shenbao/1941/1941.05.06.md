### Travelers to Hong Kong No Longer Require Visas

Chongqing - Since January 14th of this year, Hong Kong has implemented immigration control regulations, requiring Chinese citizens traveling to Hong Kong to hold a passport issued by their own country and obtain a visa from a British consulate in various locations before being allowed to enter or transit. The fee for this entry visa was approximately 60 yuan in national currency, while the transit visa cost 3 yuan. The procedures were tedious and inconvenient for travelers. After repeated negotiations with the British side by our diplomatic authorities, it has now been confirmed that the British side has agreed to waive these visa requirements.

### Roosevelt Delivers Speech Commemorating Wilson's Birthday - Democracy Will Ultimately Triumph - U.S. Will Not Hesitate to Fight Again for This

Staunton - President Roosevelt predicted yesterday the absolute victory of democratic countries and the destruction of aggressors, because "those who constantly play with swords will ultimately die by the sword." Roosevelt delivered this speech at the former home of President Woodrow Wilson, who was born on December 28, 1856, during the last world war. The residence has been made a memorial to Wilson. Among those present during the President's speech were several people, such as Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax. Roosevelt visited the former residences of two former American presidents over the weekend. In addition to President Wilson's former residence, Roosevelt also visited former President Monroe's "Ash Lawn" (i.e., President Monroe's former residence) on Saturday. The current "Monroe Doctrine" of the United States was advocated by President Monroe. President Roosevelt's current policy is based on the teachings of these two former presidents. President Roosevelt said in his speech yesterday, "We gather today to admire a new memorial to freedom. By this action, we express our true belief. What is this simple belief? It is freedom and democracy. We have fought for this belief before, and we will always be prepared to fight for this belief again. I think that the most appropriate place for you Americans to reaffirm your belief in democracy is at the birthplace of President Wilson." President Roosevelt continued to discuss Wilson's life and said, "At a time when the world is experiencing a tragic conflict that threatens everything our free people love, past historical records prove that the true progress of mankind lies in a true understanding of spiritual values. Those who constantly rely on swords to solve everything will ultimately die by the sword." The President also said, "Physical strength cannot resist spiritual strength for long. Wilson's life, though filled with hardships, is a victory of spirit over violence. Under his leadership, our country has made significant spiritual progress. Regarding Mr. Wilson, I can make the following remarks: When the world was ruled by material thinking, insatiable greed, and revenge, he alone could see a brilliant realm. Selfish people, who believe in force, cannot sympathize with his ideal of liberating the world. He will be considered an immortal statesman. When people are seeking revenge and material pursuits, he alone seeks to bring the day of Asia's liberation closer and replace violence in the world with freedom. The fact that Wilson's home will be preserved by us for a long time is a story of America. In this basin, Virginia will keep evidence for America, so that people know that Wilson's liberal ideas will support democracy in the world. He taught us that democracy cannot survive in isolation. We are deeply impressed by his judgment and belief." (5th United Press dispatch) Berlin - Authoritative German sources recently commented on President Roosevelt's speech in Staunton (according to which President Roosevelt predicted that the Republic will certainly win and aggressors will surely lose), saying that this speech is only a matter for the United States and has nothing to do with Europe, and also saying that "We will let history answer the historical question from Wilson to Roosevelt, and turning former President Wilson's house into a shrine (that is, worshipping Wilson) has no impact on Europe." (5th United Press dispatch)

### Dutch East Indies Not Planning to Make Concessions to Japan

Batavia - Well-informed sources here believe today that the chances of the Dutch-Japanese commercial negotiations collapsing are 5 to 53. The minutes of the negotiations have been sent to Tokyo, and the Japanese representative expects to receive a reply within three or four days. If Tokyo accepts the proposal, the commercial negotiations will be completed soon, as only formal issues remain to be resolved. The attitude of the Dutch government and the general public is very firm, and no further concessions can be made on the conditions stipulated in the proposal. Previously, observers had doubts as to whether the Netherlands would persist, but reliable sources now insist that the Netherlands will definitely not make concessions. (5th United Press dispatch)

### Rapid Development of Soviet Civil Aviation - Also Assists with Agricultural Work

Moscow - Regarding Soviet summer aviation, "Aviation Magazine" stated, "In 1941, the technical development of Soviet civil aviation has been extremely rapid. Last year, the PS-84 type of adjusted-bottom aircraft only flew to four cities, but this year this type of aircraft will fly to dozens of cities such as Gorky and Odessa. Night flights will be implemented for the first time, and one can arrive from Sverdlovsk to Novosibirsk overnight. In addition, the use of aircraft to kill agricultural pests will also be carried out on a large scale, and civil aircraft will scatter various insecticides on 365,000 hectares of farmland. As for the work of using aircraft to spread fertilizer, it will also be carried out in Belarus and other regions, with a scale that is eleven times larger than last year." (5th TASS dispatch)

Editorial

### The Future of the Near East War Situation

China, Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, etc., these parts of eastern Asia, close to the Pacific Ocean, are habitually referred to as the Far East; in contrast to the Far East, countries such as Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Arabia, etc., in western Asia, close to the Mediterranean Sea, are habitually referred to as the Near East (also known as the Middle East, with the Balkan Peninsula being considered the Near East). In short, the Far East and the Near East do not have clear boundaries, but are based on Europe, and in the minds of Europeans, they are regarded as the east, divided into far and near; people in the Far East, and even people more east than the Far East, echo each other, and habitually call this the Far East and that the Near East. Without considering whether its name actually conforms to reality, its being a sign of the latent power of European culture is beyond doubt. Now, the European war has expanded to the Near East. The expansion of the European war to the Near East is very likely to spread from the Far East and form a world war.

The two actors on the Near East war stage are the British army and Iraq; the fighting began four days ago, on May 2nd. So far, the news is mixed and contradictory, and it is not known who initiated the conflict first. Who went first and who went after is not about responsibility, but about military strategy. In other words, thinking from the perspective of the global situation, we hope that the British side, in terms of military strategy, has a firm grasp and is in a proactive position, and in this corner, this time, can seize the initiative and resolve the situation as soon as possible. Of course, we do not think that Iraq should be under British control, because we should sympathize with every nation's struggle for independence and freedom, and Iraq's resentment towards Britain is a matter of course; but turning to a stronger and more violent overlord, leading to a revolutionary coup, and seizing power, not hesitating to be the new master's henchmen, is not allowed to be covered by the banner of fighting for independence and freedom. We also do not believe that this time, assuming that the British army launched a preemptive strike, and that Iraq was caught off guard by a sudden foreign invasion; because in the midst of the turbulent world situation, during the struggle between Britain and Germany, the change of the Iraqi regime from pro-British to pro-German was in early April; the pro-German government of Iraq would not believe that the British side would willingly yield and remain silent, and after a month, there would be no precautions against Britain. Therefore, if the British-Iraqi fighting was initiated by Iraq, then we cannot help but imagine the seriousness of the British-Iraqi war situation.

Iraq's culture and industry are very backward; the population is only over three million, which is even less than the city of Shanghai; the political situation is notoriously corrupt and complex; the combat power is poor and weak, and it is by no means a match for Britain; assuming that the Near East war only has these two actors at present, then the scope is narrow, the scale is small, and Britain can use the spirit of suppression to quell the rebellion in a short period of time, and lay a more solid foundation of control than in the past. A blessing in disguise. However, no matter what the facts are, one cannot be so lightly optimistic. In view of the subtle relationships of religion, race, and grievances, what will be the reaction of the countries surrounding Iraq, such as Turkey, Iran, Arabia, and Syria, to the engagement of these two actors? In view of the strategic relationships of politics, economy, and military affairs, what will be the attitude of Iraq's neighbor, the Soviet Union, towards this change? These reactions and attitudes, which have not yet been determined, will all directly and indirectly affect the British-Iraqi war and the situation in the Near East. As for Germany, apart from the sky, there is no direct route to Iraq; and yesterday's news from Berlin still said that Germany adopted a reserved attitude towards this British-Iraqi conflict; that is, although Iraq is confronting Britain, Germany will not send troops "to confront Britain here and strike at it." However, the news that German aircraft flew over Syria to Iraq has been reported; and the fact that the Nazi party was actually behind the Iraqi coup is an open secret; and Hitler, on the one hand, coveted Iraqi oil, and on the other hand, planned to crush Britain; in North Africa, the German-Italian Allied forces attacked Egypt as the right wing of Germany's strategy to cut off the Suez Canal, while the Iraqi side was the left wing of coercing the Suez Canal. Thus, between Britain and Iraq, if it is an accidental conflict, or the initiation of British military strategy, then that is all; otherwise, if Iraq's war with Britain is a timely launch of part of Hitler's military strategy, then the world should pay great attention.

Assuming that this is a timely launch of part of Hitler's military strategy, it is conceivable that the scope of the Near East war will not be limited to Iraq; the military involvement of Arabia, and the political, diplomatic, and even military involvement of the Soviet Union and Turkey, will all become an integral part of the issue. Not only that, but when any stronghold of Britain on both sides of the Suez Canal is shaken, it will be the first opportunity for Japan to launch its military southward advance after today. And Japan, after signing the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty in quick succession, has recently suddenly expressed its various attitudes to the United States; this is because Japan, in the absence of any other way, has not completely given up its dream of obtaining a compromise with the United States, and it is also because Japan, before another adventure, is testing its final anesthesia on the United States and applying its final smokescreen. Subsequent developments will be closely related to the Near East war situation.

### America Will Use Surplus Food as Its Primary Diplomatic Weapon, Resisting and Aiding Axis Countries, The Slogan "Food Will Win" Revives

Washington – The slogan that "food can win wars," popular during the last World War, has recently been revived. The executive branch plans to use America's surplus agricultural products to supply Britain with food while pressuring countries dependent on the Axis powers. President Roosevelt recently stated that he had instructed Secretary of Agriculture Wickard and General Barham, who had just returned from London, to formulate a food aid plan for Britain. The Department of Agriculture also stated that most of Britain's food needs could be met by America's massive surplus, with the remaining small portion to be met by the 1940 planting. It is claimed that this approach would enable Britain to obtain ample supplies without reducing America's surplus below the "reserve point." The acreage anticipated by the Department of Agriculture is: barley at 63,408,000 acres (compared to 62,395,000 acres in 1940), grains at 87,656,000 acres (compared to 88,156,000 acres last year), oats at 37,102,000 acres (compared to 36,237,000 acres last year), and tobacco at 1,404,000 acres (compared to 1,427,000 acres last year). It is expected that this production will not only fully supply Britain but also provide sufficient surplus to supply any country resisting the Axis powers. The sending of food to countries resisting aggression will be implemented according to the provisions of the US$7 billion Lend-Lease Act. This US$7 billion appropriation includes US$1.5 billion for agricultural and industrial goods. The United States is now using food loans and relief funds as diplomatic weapons against countries under the Axis's oppressive forces against Britain. President Roosevelt's statement that the United States might ship food to Spain clearly indicates the above-mentioned action. However, one country receives American food aid not for resisting aggression, namely Finland. Finland, which lost much land to the Soviet Union a year ago, is now in dire need of assistance. Secretary of Commerce Jones has announced that the Export-Import Bank will lend Finland another US$5 million to purchase food. The Free Zone of France will also generally receive two ships of food once the supervisory distribution method negotiated with the American Red Cross is finalized. This method of supplying food may also be used to deal with Turkey and prevent it from resolutely joining the Axis. (Reuter, 5th)

### US Aircraft Production Exceeds Germany's, According to Willkie

Nashville – Republican leader Willkie declared yesterday that "within three to at most six months, the military equipment and aircraft produced by the United States alone will exceed those of Germany. If we can maintain the openness of the sea lanes, then Hitler will definitely not be able to invade the United States." Willkie stated in a speech at the groundbreaking ceremony of the Voltee Aircraft Plant, "The United States must ensure the transportation of military supplies to Britain. If Britain can maintain maritime superiority and gain air superiority, then in 1943, Britain will be on the path to victory, and freedom will come." (Reuter, 5th)

### US Actively Stockpiles Tin for Military Use

Washington – The Production Management Office issued a notice today requesting a 10% reduction in the tin coating on the outside of tin cans to stockpile tin for national defense. The notice stated that the tin currently owned by the United States and being transported to the United States is sufficient for 14 months of national defense needs. (Reuter, 5th)

### US Pays Close Attention to the Atlantic War

Washington – The focus of attention here remains on the Atlantic War. The entire country now supports President Roosevelt's shipping policy. Newspaper criticism and wireless commentary largely support the convoy advocacy of Republican leader Willkie. Some quarters are concerned that Germany may seize Dakar and Cape Verde Islands in West Africa. Newspapers also express lively concern about the important interests of the United States in the Atlantic. The New York Post carried the comments of military commentator Major Eliot, advocating that the United States should take the offensive at this time. Another writer also expressed his opinion in the newspaper that President Roosevelt must currently decide on the issue of war and peace for the United States, and that Britain cannot win without the active participation of the United States. (Reuter, 5th)

### US Senators Request Congress to Pass Foreign Vessel Conscription Bill

Washington – Senator Pepper said yesterday, "If necessary, we must convoy military supplies to Britain." The Senate will convene today to debate the convoy issue. Admiral Landon has asked Congress to quickly pass the bill to requisition 500,000 tons of foreign ships now stranded in American ports, stating that current shipping difficulties are a matter of urgency. Landon hopes that the bill can be passed within two days, but Congressional leaders predict that it will take at least two weeks to complete. (National Telegram, 5th)

### Matsuoka Makes Another Peace Overture, Says He Will Not Go to the US, But the US President Must Visit Japan

Tokyo – Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka stated last night in Kyoto that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull should visit Japan to understand Japan's true intentions. When asked if Foreign Minister Matsuoka would go to the United States, he replied, "I have a deep understanding of the United States, so there is currently no need for me to go to the United States. On the contrary, President Roosevelt and Mr. Hull should come to Japan to understand the actual situation here and Japan's true intentions." Matsuoka declined to explain Japan's policy toward the United States, saying, "I personally intend to pursue a sincere peace policy to the end because I deeply believe that sincerity can move everything. This sincerity is my belief. If sincerity cannot produce results, then I can do nothing." Matsuoka stated that he is determined to fulfill all responsibilities and use diplomacy to resolve the China Incident. Although he did not explicitly reveal it, he indicated that he had discussed this matter with Stalin in Moscow. (Associated Press, 5th)

### California Clipper Flies to Honolulu, Will Go to Singapore via the Philippines, First Passengers Number Thirty-One

Honolulu – The California Clipper, inaugurating the new weekly air route from the United States to Singapore, arrived here at 4:00 PM yesterday (9:30 AM Monday Shanghai New Time), with approximately thirty-one passengers on board.

The plane left San Francisco on Sunday, less than 48 hours after President Roosevelt signed the order authorizing the establishment of the route. The plane will make a brief stop in Manila before proceeding to Singapore. The journey from Manila to Singapore, a distance of 1,500 miles, involves flying over the China Sea (i.e., the South Seas). The Clipper flies from San Francisco to Singapore, a distance of 10,000 miles, in less than six days. Pan American Airways announced that Hong Kong, originally a point on the Pacific air route, will continue to have flights to and from it every other week. The initial flight only carries mail and inspectors from the civil aviation authorities, and normal passenger service will be handled later. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Workers Strike at Bethlehem Steel Plant

San Francisco – Two hundred skilled workers employed at the Bethlehem Steel Company shipyard here demanded double pay if they were to work as usual on Saturdays.

### New Cambodian King Pledges Allegiance to Pétain

Hanoi – Norodom Sihanouk, the new king of Cambodia, telegraphed Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux yesterday after his accession to the throne in Phnom Penh, expressing allegiance to France. The original telegram stated: "At the beginning of my accession, I especially express to Your Excellency my and my people's loyalty and confidence in France, and I hope to convey this intention to Marshal Pétain.

### US Does Not Emphasize Hitler's Speech, Britain Considers His Released Casualty Figures as Propaganda

Washington – Hitler's speech in parliament last night apparently did not elicit much criticism here. General observers believe that what Hitler said was merely a response to Churchill's use of the entire British force in a unified resistance. Some initially expected that Hitler would take this opportunity to attack the United States, but he focused his attacks exclusively on Churchill. People here point to this as an indication that Germany's recent victories have not compensated for Hitler's plans, which require breaking through the defenses of the British Isles. (Reuter, 5th)

Washington – Official sources, after listening to Hitler's speech yesterday, only predicted that Hitler would soon inevitably realize that his commentary on the "weak and ineffective US aid to Britain" was greatly mistaken. Tank cars and aircraft are being continuously exported from American manufacturing plants. Bombers fly directly from Canada to Britain, and tank cars are shipped to Africa and troubled areas. These items can produce a military impact within a few months. As for the number of German casualties in the Balkans shown by Hitler, it is extremely doubtful. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Soviet Union Commemorates Newspaper Day, Daily Sales of 16 Million Copies

Moscow – The Soviet Union today commemorates Soviet Newspaper Day throughout the country. The Soviet National Bookstore published statistics stating that in 1913, Russia only had 849 types of newspapers with a circulation of 2.7 million copies, but by 1940, the Soviet Union had 9,000 types of newspapers with a daily circulation of 38 million copies. The increase in newspapers in the Soviet republics is even greater. For example, the Tyva Republic and the Kyrgyz Republic previously had no newspapers or books, but currently, the two republics have 149 types of newspapers. In 1940, the new Soviet republics printed a total of 200 types of newspapers. Under the Soviet government, a total of 7.3 million types of books were printed, with a total circulation of 860 million copies. All books in 1940 were printed in 84 languages. The number of literary books has increased several times. Under Soviet rule, Pushkin's works were printed in 72 languages in 30 million copies, Gorky's works were printed in 65 languages in 40 million copies, and Tolstoy's works were printed in 57 languages in 21 million copies.

### Rumors of Germany Striking Iraq and Iran via Turkey, Half of Iraqi Air Force Destroyed, British Forces Advance Towards the Iraqi Capital

London – Britain's rapid occupation of Basra and the Iraqi return to Iraq, attempting to regain power, has sparked speculation here today that Hitler may suddenly strike Iraq and Iran via Turkey. Political circles here believe that Hitler's cautious response to Ali Gaylani's appeal is because Hitler hopes that the Iraqi leader can drive out the British troops on his own. However, the defeat of Ali Gaylani's troops has immediately warned Hitler to quickly prepare to take the initiative to seize precious oil. Political circles say that if Hitler wins the battle in Iraq, he can have three choices in the war against Iran. When using force against Iran, Germany can bomb the oil production centers in the southwest. Germany can also try to drive out the British troops in the Basra area and attack Iran. The final step is to use diplomatic pressure to force Iran to cede oil fields to Germany. It is believed here that Hitler will take the last step, as this move can keep the oil fields intact.

Cairo – British aircraft have fiercely attacked Iraqi airfields for two consecutive days, destroying half of the Iraqi Air Force. According to a special communique, British Air Force bombers attacked the Iraqi Moskar Rashid airfield on Saturday, hitting buildings and hangars. One Iraqi plane on the ground was destroyed, and several others were hit nearby. Two Iraqi planes attempted to attack but were shot down by escorting aircraft. On Sunday, British aircraft again fiercely attacked the area, and the airfield hangars and factories were heavily damaged. At least twenty-two Iraqi planes were bombed. The railway was also bombed, and the first train of armored vehicles derailed and overturned. British aircraft also repeatedly bombed Iraqi artillery positions, mechanized units, and concentrated Iraqi troops. Many bombs hit, and both sorties of British aircraft returned east. It was also announced that the Habbaniya airfield was shelled by Iraqi troops early yesterday morning, with slight casualties among non-combatants. British aircraft retaliated by bombing and strafing enemy mechanized forces and transport units, resulting in the gradual suppression of Iraqi artillery fire. (Reuter, 5th)

London – According to news here yesterday, British bombers struck the Iraqi army airfield in Baghdad, and imperial troops occupied the airfields and docks of Basra. As British aircraft rained bombs on Baghdad's airfield, imperial troops advanced along the Tigris River towards the capital. Meanwhile, Axis sources claimed that Iraqi troops had cut off the Haifa oil pipeline. The British War Department announced that British troops had seized the airfield and docks of Basra after fierce land and air battles. The Habbaniya airfield, 65 miles from Baghdad, is still under fierce fighting. It was reported from the Ankara radio station that fierce battles were unfolding near Kirkuk, the end point of the Haifa oil pipeline. (Associated Press, 5th)

Beirut – It is rumored that Iraqi Prime Minister Ali Gaylani has flown to Berlin. Well-informed sources here say that this is quite possible. In any case, if not to Berlin, then secretly to Turkey to meet with German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen. (Havas, 4th)

Berlin – The German Foreign Ministry announced this afternoon that Germany is paying close attention to and is extremely satisfied with the situation in Iraq. The Iraqi army has demonstrated its excellent courage. The success of the Iraqi army has shaken Britain's position in Iraq. Regarding rumors that the Iraqi government has requested assistance from Germany, no comment was made here. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

### British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Visits Turkish Foreign Minister, Reports in Detail on the Situation in Iraq, Turkish People Sympathize with Britain

Ankara – British Ambassador to Turkey Knatchbull-Hugessen visited Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu yesterday and presumably reported in detail to the Turkish Foreign Minister on all the latest developments in the situation in Iraq. The Turkish people seem to greatly understand and sympathize with the British actions, and they express regret for the actions taken by Ali Gaylani under the instigation of the Axis powers. Ali Gaylani's request for help from Germany has greatly reduced his credibility here, as the Axis powers, if they can provide him with effective assistance, will result in Turkey being surrounded by the Axis powers. However, the Turkish people acknowledge that the Axis powers may not be able to provide support. Non-official circles in Turkey believe that Germany has been extensively inciting in Arab countries and Iran, while Britain has not taken precautions, causing the situation to develop to this point, so they all express regret. It is believed that the main figure in German instigation in the Near East is the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, who will return here soon. It is expected that after Papen returns here, Germany will redouble its efforts to trap Britain in a difficult situation. The claim by the Baghdad radio station that there are now Arab combatants in Palestine may indicate that Germany will attempt to cause disturbances in Palestine. (Reuter, 5th)

### Portuguese Troops Depart to Strengthen Defense of Islands

Lisbon – Troops have been gathering here for several days and will depart to strengthen the defense of various Atlantic islands. The Pombal Infantry is scheduled to travel to Cape Verde Island this morning on the "Wide Gate" ship. (Haitong Electric, 5th)

### German Planes Fiercely Bomb Belfast, Northern Ireland, Large Shops and Churches Turn to Rubble, People of Southern Ireland Go to Rescue the Dead and Injured

Belfast – The Nazi hordes, implementing pressure to blockade the ports of western Britain in order to destroy the lifelines leading to the United States, flew to this port again in the early hours of today, bombing it for three and a half hours, turning this port into flames. Several hundred German aircraft threw various forms of bombs at Belfast, especially incendiary bombs. Countless houses have turned into piles of rubble. Looking around, all that can be seen is devastation. The bombing suffered by this port this morning is the most severe disaster the port has ever encountered. Despite such misfortune, it has established a kind of sympathy in a few hours between Northern and Southern Ireland that no British or Irish politician could have created. Large groups of Nazi aircraft committed indiscriminate killing and destruction for three and a half consecutive hours. Many important thoroughfares were subjected to the explosion of countless bombs. Most of the city has been reduced to dirt. It is feared that the number of dead and injured must be considerable. While the savage aerial blitz was attacking this port and now turning into a sea of fire, the fire brigade of Eire was unwilling to violate the boundaries of neutrality and bravely assisted the countrymen suffering severe oppression on the Irish border. As the reporter writes, the exhausted Eire people are still working bravely with the Ulster firefighters in the smoke-filled streets. The people of Belfast express warm gratitude to the many Eire people for their righteous actions. This kind of gratitude is greatly conducive to the close friendship and union between Northern and Southern Ireland. Dublin this morning provided all possible assistance to this affected city. Thousands of homeless people are collecting their money and belongings, moving to Eire and the northern region of Ireland. Extremely fierce anti-aircraft fire fired at the attackers in the moonlit sky. Authoritative sources declared that seven German aircraft were shot down in Belfast and over Britain last night and this morning. This attack was more brutal than the one on April 15. Large shops, churches, and public offices have mostly turned into smoking piles of rubble. The main target of the German aircraft seems to be Belfast, with Liverpool, Merseyside, and a certain city in the northwest being secondary targets. When the German aircraft bombed Belfast, they first dropped incendiary bombs like rain, followed by hundreds of high-explosive bombs. Some of these bombs seemed to be larger than those previously dropped on this port. When the informants reported this news to London, timed bombs frequently exploded. Anti-aircraft fire formed a continuous fire net in the air raid, and night fighters soared around the perimeter of the anti-aircraft fire net, engaging with the attackers with dense machine gun and aircraft cannon fire. Large fires broke out in many places in the port, but most of them were extinguished or brought under control after the air raid. The firefighters worked bravely during the air raid. Even with bombs raining down on their heads, they fought with the flames in a crazy battle. Although the German aircraft's air raid on this port was not as long as the attacks on some cities in Britain, its intensity was extremely fierce. A communique issued by the British Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security in London stated that German aircraft had launched a large-scale attack on Britain last night. Northern Ireland, the Northwest, and Merseyside suffered particularly badly. In addition to fires and losses in some places, many people were killed and injured. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Hitler's Speech - Full Text

(Continued from yesterday) Hitler continued, saying, "My peace proposals were seen as signs of fear and cowardice. The warmongers in Europe and America used this to deceive the public. My warning against night bomber attacks on civilians was also seen as a sign of German weakness. People generally believed that the German Air Force's self-restraint was clear proof that German planes could not fly at night. Churchill allowed British newspapers to promote to the public that only the British Air Force could adopt this type of air combat. The British Air Force's fierce bombing of German civilians and Britain's blockade measures were methods to force the German people to surrender. I have repeatedly issued warnings about this issue for three months, but these warnings have not impressed Churchill. I am not surprised; how much does he care about the lives of others? Does he still care about culture and cultural construction? When the European war broke out, Churchill declared that he hoped for war, even if several British cities would be reduced to ashes, he would not hesitate. Currently, Churchill has achieved his wish. I have stated that for every bomb the enemy drops, we will retaliate with a hundred. This warning failed to make Churchill consider the consequences of his actions. He declared that this warning could not trouble him and assured the British public that after inspecting the cities bombed by German planes, the sight of ruins and rubble filled him with joy and that he felt a hundred times more courageous upon returning to London. Churchill may be using this to strengthen his resolve to continue this type of warfare, but we are also determined to retaliate against Britain's bombs, and we will wait until the British people remove Churchill. Due to Churchill's abnormal attitude, Britain decided to turn the Balkans into a battlefield. He is like a madman searching for something to ignite in Europe. After five years, those who have been bought off reopened the door, which is truly regrettable. During the French campaign, the German army obtained French secret documents, discovering that France, between 1939 and 1940, had attempted to turn the Balkans into a battlefield, mobilizing hundreds of divisions of troops to assist Britain. Although the collapse of France prevented this plan from being realized, Churchill never abandoned it. However, after Romania joined the Tripartite Pact, Churchill felt that this plan was even more difficult to realize."

Balkan Policy

Hitler then stated Germany's Balkan policy: "(1) Germany has no territorial or political interests in the Balkans. It is not interested in the territorial and internal affairs issues that arise from the selfishness of various countries. (2) Germany will strive to increase economic relations with Balkan countries. This discovery is not only beneficial to Germany but also beneficial to the countries involved because Germany is an industrial nation that needs food and raw materials, and Balkan countries have agricultural products and raw materials and need industrial goods. If British and American individuals believe that this policy is a sign of German power invading the Balkans, it is extremely foolish. All countries should determine economic policies based on national interests and not based on the interests of Jewish and democratic capitalists as the standard for economic policies. (3) Germany hopes that countries engaged in mutual trade will maintain a healthy and strong state. Germany strives to assist all countries in consolidating domestic order and does not care about specific political systems. Due to the above measures, Balkan countries are not only becoming increasingly prosperous but have also embarked on a path of mutual trust. However, Churchill is also striving to obstruct this peaceful development. Britain's guarantees to Balkan countries use worthless promises of aid, creating instability and a lack of confidence in peaceful Southeastern Europe. Greece does not need this guarantee, but due to Britain's temptation, it shares the hardships with those who bribe the royal family. I believe that a distinction should be made between Greece's corrupt leaders and the Greek people. It is regrettable that the Greek leadership, incited by the King controlled by Britain, values British policy and disregards Greek goals. I have always praised Greek culture, and it pains me to witness this development and be unable to help. Churchill implemented his guarantees and promises last summer, causing Greece to repeatedly violate its neutrality. Italy was greatly affected and had to propose a suggestion to the Greek government last October, demanding a guarantee to cease this intolerable situation. However, the Greek government decisively rejected this request due to British pressure, and the peace in the Balkans could not be maintained."

German Attack Plan

"The harsh climate and the brave fighting of the Greek army gave the Greek government ample time to consider and find a reasonable solution. Germany had little hope of clarifying this situation. Although the warning to repel troops landing in Europe was ignored by Britain, Churchill redeployed British troops to Greece when the Italian army suffered losses in North Africa. After confirming Britain's intention to intervene in the Balkans, I initiated the necessary steps to prevent Britain's conspiracy. Therefore, Germany's initial assistance to Bulgaria was not to aid Italy in attacking Greece but merely to prevent British forces from gaining a foothold in the Balkans and inciting other countries to join the war. Britain hoped to encourage Southern countries to join the war. Since taking office, I have paid special attention to ensuring that the country can become close to Germany through economic cooperation. During the World War, the city-state was an enemy of Germany, but Germany harbored no resentment. This time, I wanted to cooperate with the Southern country to mediate the Italo-Greek war. Turkey is an ally of Germany and has also suffered pain with Germany. Mussolini also strongly agreed to invite the Southern country to join the axis's peace front, offering various benefits and asking nothing in return from the Southern country. However, two days after the signing, conspirators suddenly launched a coup, greatly shocking us, while the British Prime Minister was very proud. Therefore, I immediately ordered an attack because Germany could not tolerate being treated in this way. Our allies Hungary and Bulgaria were equally indignant. On March 27th, when I ordered the attack, I knew that it would be extremely difficult to implement my order without the loyal cooperation of Hungary and Romania. April 6th was the date set for the attack. The German army's attack plan was: (1) One army would attack the Thrace province of Greece from Bulgaria, with Thessaloniki as the target. (2) One army would attack Skoplje in the Southern country and meet up with the Italian army in Albania. (3) The third army would depart from Niš, with Belgrade as the target. (4) The fourth army would attack from western Hungary, with Zagreb as the target. At the same time, Hungary and Italy were also asked to advance. The German army attacking Greece was led by Field Marshal List, and the army attacking the Southern country was commanded by Lieutenant General Weichs. Within twelve days, the Southern country surrendered. The areas of this operation were mountainous regions with strong defenses, which many believed were impassable for tank units. However, the German army was able to pass through unimpeded. Their determination to overcome difficulties is truly admirable. The achievements of the Air Force are truly amazing. In conclusion, from this campaign, we can say that nothing is impossible for the German military. Marching through sand, gravel, mud, broken bridges, damaged roads, and narrow mountain paths, being able to declare the end of military operations in both countries within six weeks is unprecedented. However, this was also achieved thanks to the assistance of our Italian and Hungarian allies."

Scolding Churchill Extensively

"Frankly speaking, among our enemies, the bravery of the Greek army is most admirable. I must again mention the culprit of this campaign, Churchill. Churchill is a liar who is best at distorting right and wrong, confusing falsehood with truth. Even the battles of Norway and Dunkirk can be twisted into British victories to deceive the world. What could be more shameless? If it were anyone else, they would have closed their doors to guests and be too ashamed to face people. The British troops landing in Greece numbered about 60,000 to 70,000, but Churchill claimed that there were 240,000 before the defeat, with the aim of attacking Germany from the south, hoping to turn defeat into victory as in 1918. Churchill later told the British people that 75,000 German soldiers died in this campaign. This was to cover up his failure and shirk responsibility to the people. As a result of this campaign, a total of 6,298 officers and 337,864 soldiers from the Southern country were captured, as well as 8,000 officers and 210,000 soldiers from the Greek army. The Greek soldiers have been released due to their bravery in battle. Over 9,000 British, Australian, and New Zealand soldiers were captured. The captured military equipment has not yet been fully counted, but there are approximately 500,000 rifles, over 1,000 cannons, and thousands of machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, and mortars, as well as various vehicles and countless ammunition. In addition, the Air Force sank 75 enemy ships, totaling 400,000 tons, and destroyed 147 ships, totaling 700,000 tons. The German army deployed a total of 31 full divisions and two and a half divisions, with only 11 infantry and mountain divisions, 6 Panzer divisions, motorized units, and three full stormtrooper divisions and two and a half divisions actually participating in the battle. Eleven divisions did not participate in the battle. Only two Panzer divisions and one mountain division engaged British, Australian, and New Zealand troops. The German losses were the lowest among all campaigns. The German officers and soldiers who died numbered 1,099, those wounded numbered 3,752, and those missing numbered 385. The Air Force had 52 deaths and 140 missing, which shows the high efficiency of German military training. Regarding the North African campaign, the so-called British victory allowed the German army to recover all lost territory in a very short period. If the British commander was in another country, he would have been handed over to a military court for sentencing. The results of this campaign have completely and permanently eliminated the tense factors in Europe. The important waterway of the Danube River is now safe. Germany has no territorial demands in Southeastern Europe and only wants to modify the borders drawn after the World War. Politically, we maintain peace; economically, we conduct bartering, so that all parties benefit. Various rights will be considered according to geography, history, and economics. Germany will cooperate as an observer in this arrangement. The desires of all allied countries can be fully satisfied. The establishment of the State of Croatia is something we are very pleased about. Hungary and Bulgaria, which suffered unjust treatment under the Treaty of Versailles, have now been restored. Italy has also obtained its territorial and political demands, which we are also pleased to see. We have the most sympathy for Greece because the ignorance of its King and a few leaders has caused the country to suffer a great disaster. The people of the Southern country will one day realize that the soldiers who launched the coup are a danger to the country."

Praising Superior Military Equipment

"This campaign shows the importance of soldier training and the benefits of superior military equipment. Both are indispensable. The duty of the German people is to serve the country to the best of their ability. German women who have not yet followed in the footsteps of their sisters working in farms and factories should strive to participate in this service and fulfill their natural duty. Germany will never experience the tragedy of 1918 again. Germany will maintain its superior military equipment. Regarding this, we should thank the workers of the entire country. Without their efforts, our plans could not be realized. Today, my confidence is even stronger because our allies have become an invincible force in economic, military, and moral terms. 1941 will be the greatest year of victory in German history. Germany's navy, land, and air forces will continue to fulfill their duties. The spiritual strength of the German people cannot be restrained by anyone. In this era of Jewish capitalism, an era of ostentation with money and class, the national socialist nation will stand as a monument to social justice for thousands of years." (Haitong News Agency, April 4th)

Scene at the German Congress

Berlin - The German Congress held a meeting yesterday at the Kroll Opera House. Many attendees wore field uniforms, and some wounded soldiers also attended. Among them were those who had received the Iron Cross and other medals for their wartime achievements. The balconies were also filled with soldiers, including several high-ranking officers from the army, navy, and air force. The diplomatic corps' seats were also full. Speaker Goering delivered the opening remarks, first paying tribute to the fallen soldiers such as Congressman Schwarz, and then inviting Chancellor Hitler to deliver a speech. When Hitler mentioned the small number of deaths and injuries in the Balkan campaign, all the members were deeply impressed. Hitler emphasized that Turkey was an ally of Germany during the last World War and that Turkey's recent policies have also been observing the situation from a practical standpoint. Hitler also praised the Greek people and the brave Greek soldiers. The members applauded frequently during Hitler's speech. After Hitler's speech, Goering declared that after the last Congress adjourned, the German army had launched a fierce attack on the British Isles. Germany has given severe retaliation to the enemy's attacks, and the British people are deeply pained. If Churchill welcomes this entertainment, it is his own business. If Churchill is excited after observing Plymouth, which has suffered bombing, we can guarantee to continue supplying stimulants to satisfy him. Finally, Goering praised Hitler's strategic genius, believing that the German army's achievements were due to Hitler's strategy. When the Congress adjourned, it was filled with emotions of support for Chancellor Hitler, and the entire body stood up and sang the German national anthem. (Haitong News Agency, April 5th)

### Random Notes on the European War (5) (1)

Germany's Preparation for Total War

Total war is based on three concepts: detailed planning, sudden attacks, and concentrated power. Its main strategy lies in adopting a simple attack, with each action closely followed by another. This "war-sustaining war" strategy was originally commonly used by Napoleon, but Hitler innovated it, specializing in using the "evade the strong and attack the weak" tactic.

Former military science advocated "capture the king to capture the bandits first," believing that after the enemy's main force was defeated, the remaining troops would disintegrate accordingly. If one abandons the fundamental and pursues the superficial to attack weaknesses, it would only waste strength and would not fundamentally solve the war situation. This theory was applicable to former local wars, but it has become obsolete for total war.

For example, during the last European war, if the Allied forces had adopted a new strategy, then when the German army passed through Belgium to attack, they should have passed through Denmark to attack Germany, while the Russian army simultaneously launched a pincer attack on the Baltic Sea front. Later, it was too late to adopt this strategy.

The conquest strategy of totalitarian countries, with very few exceptions (such as in February 1942, when the Soviet Union miscalculated Finland's strength and launched a frontal attack on Vyborg), is monotonous. They all pre-arrange a series of grand plans and then wait for the opportunity to move. Each military action ends when public opinion in democratic countries reaches a boiling point. The targets they directly attack are so weak, defenseless, and even obviously remote places. From a military perspective, democratic countries must launch large-scale offensives to recapture a small outpost; from a political perspective, they must endure a long struggle to change an established fact.

As for Germany's new style of total war against France, it actually began seven years ago on the day the German Parliament was burned down. At that time, Hitler led the entire party, vocally opposing "Jewish Marxists" and the "Treaty of Versailles," and regarded France as a slave of both.

The beginning of total war can be seen as a product of the combination of the National Socialist Party and the German Army. German officers, generation after generation, regard military service as glorious. They constantly think about fighting at all times. It is said that General Schlieffen once accompanied his wife on a mountain tour, admiring the beautiful sunset. His wife exclaimed, "What a beautiful sight!"

"These mountains are not enough to hide from artillery fire, and this stream cannot be used as an obstacle. It is worthless militarily," Schlieffen replied.

The German Army has always avoided interfering in politics, and even when it participates, it is only a matter of acting on the occasion. They wholeheartedly only know how to implement the grand plans decided by the government. If the German government had implemented communism in 1933, the army would have already rejected National Socialism and attacked fascist Italy.

The German General Staff is the soul of the army. In peacetime, like the general staffs of other countries, they are constantly drafting various military plans to prepare for all possible wars. Staff talent is selected from active-duty soldiers, mostly from officers below the rank of field grade. The German Army's cultivation of new talent is unmatched by other countries.

After the officer training class is convened, it is divided into two groups, each led by a senior staff officer. One group represents the national general staff, and the other group represents the enemy general staff, studying military affairs separately. For example, if they are studying operations against France, they will be divided into German and French groups. Both sides have various intelligence about the forces of both countries. The German force is based on various records, while the French force is based on information from the military attaché of the embassy, secret reports from spies, and records from foreign newspapers.

These reports are extremely detailed, including everything from the number of combat divisions, the number of soldiers and machine guns in each division, the garrison location, the composition, morale, discipline, and combat effectiveness, just like the reports needed during wartime.

For example, during the last European war, when the first batch of American troops arrived in the Western Front, the German General Staff's record said that these were elite troops good at defensive warfare, but they often advanced rashly. The German army must use powerful units, deeply hidden in trenches and machine-gun positions, to wait for the opportunity to counterattack.

The German General Staff has special records for generals from various countries, explaining their unique personalities. They also have detailed reports on reserve divisions, mobilization locations, railway networks for deployment, sources of military supplies, and so on.

These two groups of German and French hypothetical general staffs plan attack strategies based on these reports. After the study is completed,

These trained officers return to their units, and another class is convened to continue the research.

Germany was originally the birthplace of military science. Experts had long understood the important role of the Maginot Line. This had a significant impact on Germany's initial war plans. The German General Staff had long known that after the Maginot Line was built, France's war plan had been completely overturned. Germany's entry into the Ruhr, military buildup in the Rhineland, and annexation of Austria would not be resisted by France. When Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, the General Staff could not guarantee that the French army would not launch a counterattack, but a counterattack might not be beneficial because Germany's Siegfried Line had been 10% completed in time.

Defensive warfare, in the eyes of the German army, is almost a false theory, except when used locally while an offensive war is underway elsewhere. Therefore, they also consider most military defenses to be false, with the exception of Britain, where the navy must determine the outcome.

In short, the German General Staff creates concrete strategies, simplifying complex issues, for any type of war. These strategies can be called "bag of tricks," ready to be implemented immediately upon hearing the signal. It is said that General Moltke was awakened from his sleep by the report of the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War and calmly instructed his men, "Open the third drawer in the cabinet over there. There is a small sealed bag inside, labeled 'War Plan No. 7'. Act accordingly." After saying this, he continued to sleep peacefully.

Hitler used troops everywhere in this European war, in Poland, in Norway, on the Western Front, and even in the Balkans, conquering everything he attacked, also completely relying on the General Staff's "bag of tricks."

### Grain
The citizens hope the Shanghai Municipal Council will bring rice, like hoping for rain during a great drought. The audacity of the rice weevils and hoarding tigers has waned, and the price has returned to a little over five or six yuan. Foreign rice ships arrive in Shanghai one after another, and over 50,000 bags arrived yesterday.

The Shanghai Municipal Council has been transporting a fixed quantity of rice to Shanghai on a monthly basis to provide for the people's food supply, stabilize rice prices, and eliminate hoarding tigers. This is one of the most beneficial policies the Shanghai Municipal Council has implemented for the people in recent years. As far as we have heard and seen, the general wage-earning class, whether their salaries are hundreds or even tens of yuan, all deeply feel the pain of rice and grain being manipulated by a small number of rice worms and hoarding tigers. They eagerly await the Shanghai Municipal Council's rice to be available on the market as soon as possible to relieve the urgent needs of the citizens, truly like hoping for rain during a great drought. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council is extremely considerate to the rice merchants, fearing that it might hinder their livelihood. In reality, the stomachs of the rice merchants are all comfortably full. Therefore, the rice is still resold to rice shops through rice brokers, and from rice shops to consumers. It is stipulated that the price sold to rice brokers is 122 yuan and 91 cents per bag, then sold by the brokers to the rice shops for 133 yuan and 50 cents per bag, and then retailed by the rice shops to the consumers for 110 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). We believe that this price sold to brokers and shops already offers generous profits. However, with the rice merchants manipulating and hoarding to drive up prices, increasing several yuan per day, and making profits of 60 to 70 yuan per bag, they feel no interest whatsoever in the Shanghai Municipal Council's "fixed profit." Furthermore, it greatly impacts the rice they have hoarded. Not only can they not voice their grievances, but they also find it difficult to dispel their resentment. Therefore, they can only resort to "passive resistance" and not act as distributors. However, whether they distribute or not, the Shanghai Municipal Council's welfare undertakings are not only praised by 85% of Shanghai citizens, but also by the foreign residents of various countries who want to maintain the security of the Shanghai market. It must be maintained. It is only that it can be handled by the rice industry. On the other hand, citizens or legitimate professional organizations in the industrial and commercial sectors, as well as companies and firms, can also be permitted to purchase a considerable quantity under the investigation and supervision of the Shanghai Municipal Council, with the same treatment as rice shops, to ensure that it is truly for the consumption of their employees to reduce their burden and to guarantee that it will not be diverted for other purposes. In this way, the price can be reduced by about ten yuan per shi. This newspaper has also received two letters from citizens, who also have suggestions on this issue. They are disclosed below:

Yang Yongsheng's letter reads, "The May 3rd Shen Bao editorial '...The Shanghai Municipal Council has obtained the assistance of the Hong Kong government and can transport 20,000 to 25,000 tons of Xiaojiao rice to Shanghai every month for regulation...The focus from now on should be on how to distribute this rice and grain so that it can be fairly and affordably put into the hands of consumers. Since the rice industry has refused to distribute it, how should the Shanghai Municipal Council seek better sales methods?...Furthermore, the current price is 110 yuan per shi...Also, how to prevent the low-priced rice and grain from being repeatedly flowing into the hands of hoarders for their use...' After reading it, I deeply feel the enthusiasm of the Shanghai Municipal Council and people from all walks of life in caring for the people's food and benefiting the people. This is truly good news for the millions of compatriots on the isolated island. However, the issue of sales still requires discussion. If not handled properly, many drawbacks will arise. Moreover, this sale of rice is not like a relief sale, but seems to be of a regular nature. Therefore, the Shen Bao editorial also said, 'The Shanghai Municipal Council should also do its best to find ways to prevent this rice and grain from being interrupted due to any accidents and must continue to be supplied continuously to benefit the people.' Therefore, it should also be handled with a long-term approach. In my opinion, under these circumstances, the people should automatically organize a rice and grain consumer cooperative to purchase directly from the Xiangmao and Liji foreign firms designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The selling price should be the market price, and the profits obtained, after deducting legitimate expenses, should be distributed according to the amount of consumption of the members. Members must use vouchers to buy rice from the cooperative. The household population of the members should be investigated first, and then given according to the number of people (for example, if member A is a family of five, they can buy three sheng of rice per day, and so on). Only in this way can the hoarders be prevented from taking advantage, and the members can also get real benefits. In my opinion, the meaning of cooperation is to eliminate all exploitation. Under the current situation of the isolated island, this kind of organization is an urgent matter. However, this matter is of great importance and requires the efforts of everyone to proceed step by step. There must be many comrades in Shanghai who agree. If you agree, please do not hesitate to give your advice."

Zhu Wenzhai's letter reads, "Dear Editor, Respectfully, I have read your newspaper's third-day editorial, and every word is accurate, and I admire it very much. Wenzhai has been engaged in the grain industry for many years, carrying out transportation and sales. I am delighted to hear that the Shanghai Municipal Council is regulating Shanghai's food supply to relieve the people's difficulties. It has been publicly announced, but the registration method of Liji Foreign Firm is limited to wholesale rice shops and retail rice shops. Although this measure is good, it is still not perfect. May I ask, how can the brokers sacrifice their own interests? Therefore, to achieve widespread coverage, we must seek people in the rice industry who are willing to serve the public and assign them to the task. I believe that among the many large rice merchants in Shanghai, are they all of the same ilk? It is a pity that no one is advocating for it. May I ask your newspaper to publicly solicit cooperative technical personnel, 'such as those who can handle the delivery and handover,' and I believe there will be no shortage of them. However, Liji still has a balance of Hong Kong rice. You can try to apply for Hong Kong rice registration and gather successful people before making a decision. For the issue of deposit money for orders, you can designate a bank to collect it to show fairness and credibility. I dare to believe that things are done by people. If you can handle widespread registration, then the people will benefit immensely. As far as I can see, I still want to ask for detailed instructions, and I would be very fortunate."

The sharp drop in the price of foreign rice yesterday was no less than the previous rise. The increase the day before was excessive, so there should be a severe correction today. However, the current high price of 140 to 150 yuan may not be able to stand firm. The benchmark price for the flat sale of Hong Kong rice is only 110 yuan. The standard price for Vietnamese rice in the future may have to be lower than this 110 yuan. Therefore, no one will naturally be interested in rice that is 30 to 40 yuan more expensive on the market. Unless they have enough brains to reduce prices and sell early to recover their capital and profits, otherwise, they will not be able to eat that much themselves. They can only let it dry in the wind, steam in the water, be eaten by insects and mold, and suffer losses in all aspects. It is even possible that they will try to steal a chicken but lose the rice used to bait it, which is also unpredictable. When the early market opened, due to the flat sale of Hong Kong rice at 110 yuan, people were unusually apprehensive, and those who stirred up trouble were also unable to be active due to the market's reformed trading methods. Furthermore, the environment was unfavorable to buyers. Although the large households still tried to make a final struggle, the many floating small households had to reduce prices and sell as soon as possible. Therefore, all stalls were selling off, especially Xiaojiao Saigon, Mindang, and broken rice. Saigon No. 1 fell from 150 yuan to 145 yuan, Xiaojiao fell from 142 yuan to 135 yuan, Mindang fell from 140 yuan to 135 yuan, and broken rice fell from 115 yuan to 104 yuan. Compared to Saturday, all fell by about seven or eight yuan to ten yuan. However, after the price fell, the owners were unwilling to sell again due to cost considerations, and the floating households and retail customers had already bought at low prices. Therefore, the afternoon market rose again by three to five yuan. However, in this situation of a large fall and a small rebound, the closing market was still weak and lifeless. No. 1 Saigon was 148 yuan, No. 2 was 144 yuan, Mindang was 140 yuan, and Xiaojiao was 140 and 139 yuan. In total, there was a total drop of five or six yuan after one rise and one fall. The turnover was less than 7,000 bags. Yinghua Company opened 500 tons of broken rice at 136 yuan, also down about ten yuan.

Although domestic rice such as Houbo and Geng still had smooth arrivals, everyone was apprehensive due to the sharp and special sale of foreign rice. Retail sales in the hometown stores suddenly stagnated, and the owners, wanting to avoid huge losses, had to reduce prices to attract customers. Therefore, during the period of the most severe price drops in the central market, it was similar to foreign rice and also fell by about ten yuan. Houbo only opened at 151 yuan and 150 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice were 145 and 146 yuan. However, when it was heard that foreign rice was tightening up again, it also rose again accordingly. Therefore, the result was that Ruoxi Geng was 153 and 154 yuan, Kun Geng was 151 and 152 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice were 148 yuan. According to statistics, the city as a whole had one fall and one rise, with a total drop of about six or seven yuan. As for glutinous rice and glutinous green rice, they were still not available. In short, this price drop was really due to the Shanghai Municipal Council's flat-priced rice, which caused this situation. We applaud the future of the people's food supply. Looking back at the past rice market, since the Geng Hong market this year, it has been under the monopoly and manipulation of hoarders all the way, so that rice prices have been rising every day. After accumulating for days and months, we have finally seen a glimmer of dawn. I hope that the authorities will continue unabated, and the price of rice in the future will definitely have a day when the clouds clear and the sun shines, and the people of Shanghai will be freed from their suffering.

Large quantities of foreign rice are arriving continuously. The Taikoo Company's Anhui ship transported 21,186 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and arrived on the 4th, berthed at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong to unload onto the warehouse. Also, the Jinan ship arrived in Shanghai on the 4th, also transporting a large batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong, totaling 15,279 bags, berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload onto the warehouse. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship also arrived on the 4th, transporting a large batch of foreign rice totaling 14,080 bags, and another 1,964 bags of corn, berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The three ships brought a total of more than 50,000 bags of foreign rice, and there is no doubt that there is a sufficient supply of foreign rice. The Taikoo Company's warehouse is already full, so the foreign rice transported by the company's recent ships are all stored in other warehouses. This is enough to prove the abundance of rice storage. (Zu)

### Foreign Flour Unable to Support and Rebounds Slightly

Foreign flour first stabilized and then fell, which is contrary to the trend of last Saturday. It was found that the market was calm when the market opened in the morning, and Jinlong brand Kan flour opened at 33 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen, and Huaniao brand Australian flour opened at 34 yuan and 1 jiao, only slightly weaker by one or two jiao. In the afternoon, the situation suddenly became unsustainable. Because the rice market plummeted, the authorities were determined to maintain the people's food supply, and the number of international shipping vessels could gradually increase after this, and the source of foreign goods was smooth, people's hearts were quite weak, so the Kan and Australian flours in the after-market were each lower by three, four, or five jiao, etc. However, the transaction was suppressed and was extremely dull. Hua factory's flat-priced flour continued to be supplied by Fuxin factory with more than 5,000 bags, the price was 29 yuan, plus miscellaneous expenses of 5 jiao per bag, which was distributed by the designated merchants. Today, there are 1,000 bags of flour, loaded onto Taikoo Company's Yuezhou ship to be transported to Xiamen.

The domestic wheat market had already stopped and there was no market, because the old wheat prices dropped, and both supply and demand were silent. Foreign wheat arrivals were made into flour by Hua factories specifically for flat sales, and were also not entering or exiting the market. The Japanese factories' over-the-counter purchases were also intermittent, and there was generally no regular market, so the market remained stalled as usual.

### Oil Cakes/Bean Cakes Experience Ups and Downs

Yesterday, the bean cake market situation first carried on the weakness of last Saturday. The opening price was low, and it once dropped by six or seven jiao. Later, there were many who took advantage of the cheap price to pick up profits, and it rebounded, and then pressed down again. As a result, there were mutual discrepancies. According to statistics, 1,000 pieces of Kai Li Zi cake were made, and the price was 10 yuan. Yuanren cake's contract for 2,000 pieces to be delivered in the lower half of May was 20 yuan and 6 jiao. Xing Ji cake's price for delivery in the upper half of May was 21 yuan and 7 jiao to 22 yuan, and the price for delivery in the lower half of May was 22 yuan and 2 jiao to 23 yuan and 1 jiao.

240 bags of soybeans were exported to Xiamen on the 6th, and 955 bags were exported to Hong Kong.

### Finance, Chinese Merchants Continuously Sell Foreign Exchange at a Premium

Yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate for each exchange was not changed. The gray market for British and American exchange rates was steady and continued to be slightly looser. This was because the price of gold was weak, and Chinese speculators threw out more than 200,000 yuan of American exchange. HSBC and Dao Heng and other Hong Kong telegraphs had quite some intention to buy. The Japanese bank and Chinese banks also supplied them one after another, so the US dollar was 5.1875 yuan, which could be given as soon as June. British gold was three offices and 2.21875 yuan. By noon, the slack was slightly rebounded. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants continued to cover the shortage, Hong Kong telegraphs came out again, and the price of gold fell slightly faster.

Afterwards, Dao Heng and other Hong Kong telegraphs came to collect and absorb it, and it began to turn stable. The HSBC listing did not change any of the exchanges. After the silver balancing tax was still levied at 24.50%, speculators still continued to sell non-stop. Chinese banks and Japanese banks successively spat out US dollars for May and June at 5.1875 yuan, most of which were absorbed by HSBC and other banks. The situation stabilized at noon.

### The Large Empty Account Movement: The Gold Market Has Been Pressed Down Without Being Lifted Up: The Current Price Is Weaker and Scraped More Than Fifty Yuan

Yesterday, the black market for gold futures continued to weaken, and the price had broken into the 6,700 yuan mark. This was because it inherited the fatigue of the previous weekend, the foreign exchange rate loosened, and people's hearts were even softer. Empty positions rose in all directions to increase their bets, which was caused by the activity. Under the selling pressure from the Silver Shop Gang (Zhongxing), the Securities House (Yida Defu increased their bets and massively flipped to empty), the Draft Bank (Dafeng increased their bets), and the Silver Number Gang (Hengji increased their bets) one after another, most retail investors were short, with pressure but no lifting, causing the price to show a trend of large drops and small rebounds. From the opening price of 6,710 yuan in the morning, it gradually decreased to a low price of 6,665 yuan before the late close, eventually continuing to fall by 39 yuan. The total transaction was about 25,000 to 6,000 liang.

The jewelry gold also decreased by 5 yuan, retreated to the 700 yuan mark, and Guan Jin, etc., were all flat.

The futures fell forty yuan weak

Since the opening of the market at 9:15 a.m. every bar (ten liang), it was 6,710 yuan, which was the same as the closing price of last Saturday. The Silver Shop Gang Zhongxing came to sell fiercely, and Yida Dafeng Chida also sold, and it was immediately seen that it retreated outside the 6,700 yuan, falling 24 yuan, and retreated to 6,686 yuan. At that time, Yida resumed its advance, and Tianyuan Hengji both bought, and it was seen to be lifted up. Tongkang Yong also turned to sell and bought, and at 9:50 a.m., it rose to 6,705 yuan.

### Securities
National Debt Stalemated

Yesterday's market conditions for the national debt gray market were still hovering and sluggish. The difference between the high and low prices was no more than two or three jiao. Various gangs watched each other with their arms folded, all expecting future changes. Such repeated brewing, the longer the time, the greater the changes, which cannot be taken lightly. The United States loan agreement was signed, and the debt market did not rise due to feeling it. The loss of the war in eastern Zhejiang, the debt market did not fall due to feeling it. Therefore, the current smooth progress of the war in eastern Zhejiang, the market also does not feel the joy or sorrow. The reason for its numbness is still that the long and short positions are firmly fixed, the short side thinks that the opportunity can be taken advantage of, and the long side has abundant mobile funds. The two sides are equally matched, and even held on tightly, leading to a path of hovering and brewing. The stalemate in the future is still difficult to break. It was heard that yesterday's transactions, the morning was bought by Dunyu and retail investors, and sold by Runli and Lianyi. In the afternoon, Shunchang Xie Xingyuan bought, and Lianhe and Lianyi sold. The market price rose and fell between two or three jiao, and the result was still that high and low prices were seen, and the trend was still sluggish. The turnover was about one million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

In stock trading, 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd. were traded at a price of 24 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton, Actual Sales Clear, Margin Drops: Double Horse Still Being Lifted: Miscellaneous Brands of Yarn Fail to Follow: Selling Price Pulled Away Two Hundred Yuan

The yarn market continued to rise, and the situation was still tight. This was because the public's psychology was optimistic, so the current situation was still in a state of more entries than exits. The situation wanted to fall but rose. However, the foreign exchange rate was loose, and the margin trended down. Because of this, those who made profits had some exports. They still could not break through the 600 yuan mark for the rice market. In fact, the sales of current yarn were not as prosperous as in the past. In addition, the miscellaneous brands of yarn failed to follow up on the progress. 20 counts of Shuangdiqiu could not sell for 1,355 yuan, and the price difference with Shuangma was as huge as 230 yuan. 20 counts of Danu sold for only 1,400 yuan, also pulled away 180 yuan. In such a situation, Shuangma would indirectly be affected. The high price for 20 counts of Shuangma was 1,584 yuan, and the low price was 1,563 yuan. The initial transaction in the afternoon was 1,581 yuan, and it rose to 1,586 yuan. After that, it was heard that the margin gradually fell, the selling wind was more intense, and it fell to 1,574 yuan. The final price was 1,575.6 yuan. Today, six pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Xiamen, and 18 pieces were transported to Hong Kong.

### Cotton Factory Stomach Movement

### Grain Transport in Hong Kong and Shanghai has Announced Joint Control: Starting Next Month, the Hong Kong Government has Exclusive Rights: All Rice and Grain Transported to Shanghai is Handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council: The Price of Rice Finally Saw a Fall Yesterday, and it is Expected to Fall Another Twenty Yuan

Yesterday it was widely rumored that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council of the French Concession, in order to stabilize the food supply of Shanghai citizens, in addition to adopting the same steps, respectively ordering a large amount of cheap foreign rice from overseas rice-producing areas to transport to Shanghai for regulation, now in order to implement the original intention, starting from the 10th of this month, the price of rice in the two concessions will be restricted, that is, the maximum price per stone will be 110 yuan, and it must not be deliberately increased. Otherwise, the citizens who buy and sell rice can report to the authorities, so that they can be investigated and dealt with according to the law. However, the authorities of the two concessions have not yet issued a formal communiqué on the matter.

French Municipal Council's Procurement Plan

In order to make the outside world understand the general situation of the French Municipal Council's food planning, it specially invited news reporters from the Chinese newspapers and news agencies in Shanghai to the Superintendent's office of the Council on Avenue Joffre at 4 p.m. yesterday. On the spot, Superintendent Ding Gu published information on the food problem, saying that in order to strictly manage the rice market, the Council had previously taken appropriate steps and initiated the establishment of a Food Management Committee, which has been in operation for eight months. It has cooperated a lot with the Public Concession Food Management Committee. However, the current food panic is getting worse. The Council is planning to purchase a large amount of foreign rice from Vietnam and other places and transport it to Shanghai. At that time, it will be sold at a low price. However, the vessels and water fees are still under negotiation. The Council is now focusing all its attention on this issue so that it can be realized as soon as possible.

Jardine Matheson and Taikoo are Responsible for Transporting Rice

The first batch of cheap Xiaojiao rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession may arrive here around the beginning of this month, and will arrive separately thereafter. Regarding the transportation, the Shanghai Municipal Council has now reached an agreement with the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies, and the two shipping companies will subsequently take full responsibility for loading the cheap Hong Kong rice. Regarding various procedures, the authorities have also entrusted Liji and other two foreign firms to handle them. According to inquiries with Liji Foreign Firm, (1) Several grain firms in the city have signed a contract with the foreign firm for more than 10,000 bags of Rangoon rice. When the Shanghai Municipal Council decided on this rice transportation plan, it advised the grain and rice industry to purchase it, but it was rejected. Now that it is certain that the rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council will arrive in Shanghai for sale around the 15th of this month, if they do not order it as soon as possible, they will not be able to obtain this legal profit. They have to change their attitude. (2) Rice shops in the city have been in contact with the firm to undertake sales in recent days, with a total of about 10,000 bags. However, most of them are small rice shops, and the large rice shops are still watching, because they have hoarded a lot and cannot sell it off for a while. (3) Householders in the city have also been ordering from the foreign firm in recent days. However, in order to take into account the business of legitimate rice shops, the firm politely requested residents to order from the rice shops. If the price, weight, and composition are inconsistent with the regulations of the authorities, the foreign firm can send personnel to investigate. (4) This Hong Kong rice is 40-count Xiaojiao rice, which is exactly the same quality as the 140 yuan per stone sold on the market today. It is by no means the Xiaojiao broken rice that is rumored outside.

The price of rice finally saw a drop yesterday

Yesterday morning, after the rice market opened for business, it still traded according to the original method. Although the order was chaotic and disorganized, people's hearts were extremely tired. The prices of rice at each stall tended to go downstream at the beginning of the market, and those who hoarded the goods all reduced the prices of a large amount of rice to seek sales, but the rice shops' acceptance was very tired, and the market situation was quite different from before. As a result, the price of rice fell by about four yuan per stone compared with the previous market. The market once fell sharply by more than nine yuan yesterday morning. This was the first major drop in more than three months. Responsible people claimed that after the rice price fell this morning, it is expected that the rice price will soon fall sharply again. After the rice price trended down this morning, it is expected that it will fall another 20 yuan. The first batch of Vietnamese rice handled by the French authorities is expected to arrive in Shanghai within two weeks.

### Yesterday's Fifth Festival: The Entire City Celebrates with Flags, All Sectors Follow the Revolutionary Personality of the Founding Father to Rescue the Nation from Crisis

Yesterday, on the "May Fifth" Festival, the anniversary of the establishment of the revolutionary government with Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father, assuming the position of Extraordinary President, all sectors of the city, in accordance with the methods negotiated by various public groups and the concession authorities, uniformly celebrated by raising flags, with extreme enthusiasm. In the tenth year of the Republic [1921], the national situation was precarious, with internal warlords rampant and external powers coveting, making it seem impossible to survive. The Founding Father, disregarding the dangers of the environment, resolutely assumed the post of Extraordinary President on May 5th, continuing to shoulder the great cause of the revolution. This marked the establishment of the revolutionary government. All sectors, taking the Founding Father's resolute assumption of the office of Extraordinary President at that time, his uncompromising stance, and his fearlessness of difficulty as examples, which laid the foundation for the subsequent oath to launch the Northern Expedition and stabilize the entire country, decided during this national crisis, at a time when the entire country is striving, to emulate the revolutionary personality of the Founding Father, to not shirk any hardships and difficulties, and to strive forward to rescue the nation from crisis and complete the rejuvenation of the nation.

### Coal Ball and Flour Prices Still Controlled by Hoarders, Coal Merchants Still Attempting to Speculate and Raise Prices, Flour Prices Hold Firm, Noodle Prices Increase

Since both rice and coal balls have repeatedly increased in price, citizens' food expenses have greatly increased. Now, the rice problem has been planned by the Public Works Department and the Board of Directors, and Hong Kong rice can arrive at the port for distribution, and the situation has changed. However, the fuel item is still tightly controlled by hoarders. For example, a certain coal ball factory has 2,000 tons of warehouse receipts that cannot be recovered, so coal prices have plummeted. Moreover, it is rumored that the coal industry is secretly discussing adding 40 yuan per ton to white coal and 18 yuan per load to coal balls. This has not been implemented temporarily due to the long-term foreign exchange. The authorities should pay attention to this and suppress it in advance to prevent it from becoming a reality. Moreover, flour prices are also affected by hoarders. Although it was proven yesterday that 200,000 bags of American flour were shipped to Shanghai, the price only fell by about 2 yuan, which shows that hoarders have not let go of the flour, resulting in rising prices for all kinds of noodles. The only economical food for the poor (pancakes and fried dough sticks) has increased from 3 cents to 5 cents. Although it was once reduced due to the increase in flour prices, it was still sold at the original price. Now, it is also affected by other commodity prices, so the guild announced that it will be sold for 10 cents per piece from yesterday (but most have not implemented it). Others, such as soup, have increased from 3 cents to 5 cents, and bowl noodles have increased by 50% to 100%. Congee has increased from 5 cents to 8 cents, glutinous rice cakes have increased from 5 cents to 10 cents, soy milk has increased from 5 cents to 7 cents, and bowl rice in restaurants has increased by 50%. In fact, all kinds of food have increased in price. The Moore Memorial Church's flat-rate white rice has also increased its price again yesterday, selling for 30 cents per catty.

Officially Announces Joint Control

The Shanghai Times quoted a Hong Kong telegram from the Allied News Agency on the 4th, saying that the Hong Kong government officially announced yesterday that it has exclusive rights over all rice imports and exports from June 1st. The gazette on the exclusive rights plan stated that the rice situation in Hong Kong and Shanghai has not been satisfactory in the past few months, and speculative activities are rampant. Rice profiteers are insatiable and cannot be fully controlled. Only the joint control of the two authorities can prevent consumers of rice from being exploited as much as possible. It is obvious that the Hong Kong government and the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department have agreed on a method for this purpose, stipulating that rice transported to the Shanghai Public Concession should be handed over to the Public Works Department, so the department will now directly transport these rice grains and distribute them to retailers. Because rice prices in Hong Kong are extremely high, and the future supply of rice is uncertain, and there are fewer and fewer ships, the Hong Kong government plans to exclusively manage the import and export of all rice after the expiration of the current rice import license on May 31. Exclusive management is only a wartime measure, but it may be necessary to continue it for some time after the end of the war. In the past few years, Thailand's rice harvest has been relatively small, and obtaining rice from other places on a regular basis is not certain. Therefore, the rice consumed and transported out of Hong Kong must be obtained from Myanmar as much as possible.

### Spring Cocoons Cannot Be Opened for Sale, Silk Mills Dismantle Machines and Stop Reeling, Some Silk Mills Are Converted into Other Factories, Spring Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Are All Controlled by Japanese Merchants

Spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to be listed on the market. Due to the control of the China Silk Company, silk cocoon manufacturers are prevented from setting up branches to purchase them. Silk mills in the Shanghai Public Concession have been forced to stop their machines due to the exhaustion of raw materials, and the cocoon collection plan cannot be carried out due to the control of Japanese merchants. Spring cocoons in eastern Zhejiang cannot be transported to Shanghai due to transportation difficulties. The silk industry in Shanghai is on the verge of extinction.

In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the listing of spring cocoons generally starts in mid-May and ends in early June, lasting only about two weeks.

Manufacturers Stop Buying Spring Cocoons

In the past, spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang often had a great impact on the financial market in Shanghai. When spring cocoons were listed, a large amount of cash flowed from Shanghai to the inland, which was enough to cause the Shanghai foreign exchange rate to rise and the money supply to tighten. This year, however, is different. The Shanghai silver and money industry has refused to provide loans for cocoon collection in the occupied areas, and silk factory merchants and remaining cocoon merchants regard cocoon collection as a daunting task. Therefore, although spring cocoons are about to be listed, there is no organization or company going to collect them. As a result, silk factories in the Shanghai Public Concession have stopped their machines due to the exhaustion of raw materials, and the resumption of operations is far away. Moreover, some silk factories have dismantled their silk reeling machines and converted them into other factories.

Silkworms Sell Local Silk

Small family silk factories in the inland, which were newly established after the war to avoid Japanese merchant control, now have a maximum of 40 silk reeling machines. The silk reeled is sold to various silk weaving factories. At this time when spring cocoons are about to be listed, they are going to various guerrilla areas where Japanese military power cannot reach to purchase them. It is also heard that silkworm farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are unwilling to sell the cocoons they have harvested to the control agencies, and they are reeling the cocoons into local silk themselves for sale. However, the control agencies are suppressing cocoon prices and forcibly buying them, so silkworm farmers are complaining constantly. It is also heard that some silkworm farmers have transported cocoons to eastern Zhejiang for sale.

The title deeds of such properties are old Fang Dans that are more than 100 years old. Under the Land Regulations of the Public Concession, the tax issue of such properties has never been satisfactorily resolved. The case was initially heard by Lang, the Secretary of the Consular Body, for nearly two months. During the hearings, the lawyers from both sides had many "fierce" debates.

### French Concession Garbage Workers, Bureau Hopes to Resume Work, Chief Inspector Ding Gutiti Announces the Reasons for the Strike

At 4 p.m. yesterday, the French Municipal Council invited more than a dozen news reporters from Shanghai newspapers. Inspector Ding Gutiti of the Municipal Council made the following statement:

Garbage Cleaners Suddenly Went on Strike

The strike of the garbage workers in the French Concession occurred at 2 a.m. on the 27th of last month. All the garbage trucks had already driven out when a group of workers stopped working and abandoned their trucks. Soon after, the entire workforce responded. Upon investigation, this unfortunate incident occurred without any prior demands or petitions. The Bureau was completely unaware of it beforehand. In order to safeguard the welfare of the residents in the Concession, the Municipal Council temporarily hired White Russian workers to clear the garbage. In order to understand the workers' difficulties, they were allowed to resume work unconditionally. Most of the workers have resumed work one after another. Unexpectedly, when wages were distributed last Saturday, a small number of workers were dissatisfied with the deduction of wages during the strike period and threw stones at other workers. Therefore, some of them continued the strike. In order to be fair, the Bureau had to deduct the wages of the striking workers during the strike period, because the workers who drove the garbage trucks had never joined the strike.

The Bureau Still Hopes to Work as Usual

According to Mr. Ding, there are 2,200 Chinese employees in the entire French Concession, including 1,200 to 1,500 workers. Only 380 of them continued the strike this time. The authorities still hope that they will join the work. So far, no one has been fired. However, anyone who wants to resign is free to do so. The entire savings under the monthly wages are allowed to be withdrawn. As for the wages, the first 55 people who initiated the stoning and caused trouble were detained in the police station. The lowest-level workers under the Municipal Council had a monthly salary of 17 yuan in 1937, which has now increased to 100 to 130 yuan. The drivers were paid 40 yuan before, and now they are paid 162.78 yuan. As for other employees, they were paid 91 yuan before, and now they are paid 287 yuan. In addition, there is a monthly rice subsidy, which was 45 yuan in March, increased to 55 yuan last month, and is expected to increase to 66 yuan this month. The rice subsidy is calculated based on the rice price on the 15th of each month. The workers' unreasonable demands for wage increases will only increase the burden on the taxpayers in the Concession. The two sides not only did not hold a meeting, but the Bureau did not take any steps.

### New U.S. Cargo Ship Maiden Voyage to Shanghai, Carrying a Large Amount of U.S. Goods, The Alava Scheduled to Berth This Afternoon, Two Ships Will Arrive in Shanghai Every Month Thereafter

The Alava, the newest type of U.S. cargo ship, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning on its maiden voyage directly from Seattle, USA, passing through Vancouver, Havana, San Francisco, and Honolulu without stopping. This time it carries a large amount of U.S. goods, which will be unloaded in Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the war in Europe by the United Kingdom, the Far East voyages of U.S. ships have decreased. U.S. cargo ships will gradually replace them. Another new ship, the New Frantley, is also scheduled to sail from Seattle to Shanghai in mid-May to join the Shanghai-U.S. route. The above two ships are now managed by the Shanghai Fraley & Co., Ltd. and operate between Seattle, Portland, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Little Luzon. The Alava is the first of the new-style cargo ships built by the American Mail Line. It has a deadweight of 7,900 tons and a speed of 14 knots per hour after loading. It is reported that more U.S. cargo ships will be added to the Eastern route one after another, with one cargo ship arriving in Shanghai every half month. According to a reporter from New Voice News Agency, Collinsworth, Stardie, and Coltbrock will also serve Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Seattle at the same time.

### Changshou Pharmaceutical Factory Held Founding Meeting Yesterday, Elected Directors, Supervisors, and Managers

### Visitors from Ningbo Talk About the Recent Situation in Ningbo

Since the traffic between Ningbo was cut off, the news was extremely isolated. All the fellow villagers in Shanghai were very concerned. Recently, I met a gentleman who had just arrived in Shanghai last night and learned about the recent situation. According to him, he disembarked from Longshan on the evening of April 28 and traveled through the mountains, Datuan, and Shizhu to reach Shanghai, a journey of three days. The shops in Sanbei are open as usual. However, it is heard that a fire was accidentally caused by residents in Fangjiahetou, burning down 30 to 40 houses. A carpenter's workshop outside Ximen also caught fire, but it was immediately extinguished and did not cause a major disaster. As for Ningbo City, tap water, electric lights, etc. are still the same as before. The large shops on Dongda Road and Xida Road have resumed business. The telephone bureau, post office, and other agencies have also resumed operations. However, there are 40,000 to 50,000 refugees who are suffering from the war and have insufficient food reserves, making relief difficult. They are struggling to survive and are waiting to be fed, which is very pitiful. Although local groups are trying their best to provide relief, it is ultimately a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that fellow villagers in Shanghai will do their best to help and relieve the disaster victims.

### Buddhist Sacred Tree Transplanted to Jueyuan

The Bodhi tree under which Sakyamuni attained Buddhahood 2,500 years ago was transplanted to Ceylon by Ashoka King in 288 BC. In 1935, Venerable Narada again divided the seedlings of this tree and brought them to China, giving them to the Jueyuan Pure Land Society. This year, Ceylonese layman Hui Luopuli donated funds to rebuild the new altar. The Society respectfully held a transplant ceremony yesterday (on the morning of Buddha's Birthday). The garden was full of lanterns and surrounded by incense and flowers, which was extremely solemn. Hundreds of Buddhists, including Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Zhi, Zhao Puchu, Hui Luopuli, and Anthony, participated in the ceremony.

### Central Police Station Detectives Cracked Armed Gang, These Bandits Have Committed Many Crimes, Strict Investigation and Arrest of Accomplices

The China Press reported that in order to crack down on another armed gang active in the Concession, detectives from the Central Police Station of the Public Concession suddenly went to a certain hotel on Saturday night and successively arrested eight male bandits and three female bandits. It is heard that they have all committed crimes, and there will be fugitives arrested in the next few days. The detectives believe that the gang is very large.

The detectives did not seize any guns when they arrested the bandits, but they believe that the weapons they used will be found in the next few days. It is not yet certain how many crimes the bandits have committed, but it has been proven that they have been active in the Central District, the Old Zhabei District, and the Chengdu Road District. It is also possible that they have committed crimes in other areas of the Public Concession and in the French Concession. The detectives from the Central Police Station first went to a certain hotel on Hankou Road on Saturday night, taking

swift action to arrest five bandits in a certain room, who were taken back to the police station to interrogate their activities and the whereabouts of their accomplices. After a while, the detectives went to the hotel again and arrested three women, who were heard to be related to the theft case. Soon after, with the cooperation of detectives from the French Concession, they went to a certain hotel on Lafayette Road and only arrested one bandit. According to his confession, they obtained the assistance of the Japanese authorities and went to a certain house in Laoximen, the Southern City, and arrested two bandits. No guns were found. The police believe that there are still many members of the gang at large, and many robbery cases can be solved when they are arrested.

### Impersonating Swindlers to Scare Pig Merchants, Three Criminals Arrested

Huang Qixun, who runs a pig business at No. 127, Alley 573, East Xihua Road, and is also a livestock market broker, received a threatening letter on the 27th of last month from the Special Operations 2nd Detachment of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army, requesting Huang to donate 2,000 yuan for military expenses and instructing him to send it to a certain place. Huang reported it to the police station, who ordered detectives to go and wait. However, the bandits did not send any representatives, so they could not be arrested. Until the day before, Xue Youwen, a Chinese detective of the Old Zhabei Police Station, and Detective Ding Yizhong received a report from an informant that bandits were hiding in Room 34 of the Zhongshan Hotel at No. 480 Tianjin Road. They went to arrest them and arrested Shen Aimin from Ningbo, Zheng Qingben from Ningbo, and Huang Jiufeng from Anhui on the spot. It was found that Shen and others were the ones who sent the threatening letter to Huang Qixun, and they also found a second threatening letter to Huang that had been written but not sent. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court 1. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested a postponement. After questioning by Judge Chuan Lin, he ordered them to be detained for a later hearing.

### Monk Sells Opium, Trafficker Convicted

Yun Zhao, the presiding monk of Baobentang Chan Temple at No. 1622 Changsha Road, instructed Lu Jinbao, a local resident living next door, at 6:30 p.m. on April 27 to take 40 grams and 11 small packets of opium, hidden in a Cocoa cigarette box, and send them to Yinghua Lane on Xiaoshadu Road, to be handed over to a certain person. When passing near Kangnaot Road and McGonigle Road, he was arrested by Chinese police officer No. 3252, who found the opium. After questioning, he learned the truth. He then went to Baobentang to arrest the monk, but he could not be found. Three opium pipes and seven small packets of heroin were found in his room. They were taken to the Gordon Road Police Station and sent to the First District Court. After the interrogation was completed, they were waiting for the sentence to be pronounced. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial and sentenced Lu Jinbao to four years of imprisonment and confiscation of the evidence.

### Wing On Company Installs New Fluorescent Lamps

### Shanghai in the Eyes of Foreigners

— (Tao)

Many of your fellow countrymen are really too "naive." Once I saw a large group of people gathered together. I asked what was going on. It was said that they were arresting robbers. I didn't believe they were all detectives arresting robbers. Most of them were very curious, so they took a closer look, but they complained that both the detectives and the robbers were armed. What was their position? This is like children playing with fire, too "naive"!

When Germany invaded, refugees from the Netherlands, Belgium, and France fled, hindering military transportation on the roads. Here, in many public places, it is often like a flood of people escaping, scrambling to be the first. In fact, if everyone can politely maintain order, work can proceed as usual. A lot of effort can be saved by not squeezing, and many trivial quarrels can be avoided. Do you agree?

Probably because Shanghai is a commercial port, there are many people doing business. Many doctors, lawyers, professors, bankers, and reporters also speculate and sell goods. It seems that they can't make a living without doing this business, but the poor people here are suffering a great loss from them!

You want me to tell you about the current cost of living in Shanghai. I'll simply tell you: "I once asked a rickshaw driver. He said that he had to eat fifteen sesame cakes for each meal, each costing five cents, which is seventy-five cents. He eats three meals a day, just sesame cakes made of flour, which costs two yuan and twenty-five cents a day. So he must have an income of more than four yuan a day to maintain his livelihood." This is the standard of living for low-level Chinese. You can imagine the standard of living for middle and high-level Chinese!

Shanghai is a big city, and of course, you can't finish writing about its affairs in a lifetime, especially since I am a foreigner who has just arrived in Shanghai! And I am talking about this topic in front of you, an "old Shanghai," so I dare not write too much. I hope to have the opportunity to take a closer look and experience it more carefully in the future, and write you a few more long letters to talk about it.

I often go to the home of Miss P, who came on the same ship, to play. Shanghai's entertainment is really not to my taste. I live in the French Concession in West Shanghai, which is still clean. There are many farmers who grow vegetables next door, living in short, dark houses, but they are full of energy. In the evening, I often see them talking and laughing in the small courtyard, seemingly very happy. When I see them, I seem to be happier than seeing the wealthy people who are good at hypocrisy.

I've said too much. You said you want to return to your hometown. Come and see this prosperous "Isolated Island of Shanghai"! I wish you a pleasant trip! Goodbye! (Shen)

### Japanese Warehouse at Wayside Wharf Set on Fire, Suspected Sabotage, Several Suspects Arrested

At about 8 a.m. on the day before yesterday (the 4th), a fire broke out in the cotton pile warehouse of the Japanese East Asia Shipping at Wayside Wharf in East Shanghai.

Afterwards, the Japanese found many suspicious items in the burned area in the cotton pile. They determined that someone intended to commit arson, so the military and police conducted a strict investigation. It is also heard that several suspects were arrested by the Japanese and are currently being interrogated.

### Dyeing Price Temporarily Increased by 50%

It is expected that it will be resolved soon.

### Xin Huan No. 2 Elementary School Expected to Resume Teaching Today: School Authorities Accept Three Conditions, Final Decision on the Focus

The staff of the private Xin Huan No. 2 Elementary School on Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road in this city went on strike on the morning of the 2nd to demand that the school improve their treatment. This has been reported in various newspapers. According to the most reliable sources from the Da Hua and Guang Hua news agencies, this strike has taken a sharp turn after the relevant parties sent personnel to mediate yesterday. It is expected to resume teaching today. It is understood that the conditions accepted by the school are as follows: 1. A living allowance of 20 yuan per person for May and June. 2. Salaries are calculated on the basis of six months per semester. 3. A living allowance of 10 yuan for July of this semester. According to the above third item, the original focus of the stalemate between the two sides was that the teachers and staff insisted on a living allowance of 20 yuan for July as well, while the school refused due to financial inability to bear it. Subsequently, the educational administration made a final decision late at night, adopting a compromise approach and issuing a living allowance of 10 yuan in July. After the school accepted it, the teachers and staff who remained at the school also considered the overall situation and were willing to accept it. Therefore, the school issued a notice late yesterday, scheduling the resumption of classes today. It is expected that this strike will be resolved in this way, unless there are special circumstances.

### How to Choose Books (II)

— Zhou Liangsheng

(3) Regarding Interests and Cultivation

A person's interests are subject to change. Someone who likes literature at one time may soon like science. In terms of cultivation, the situation changes even more. For example, as Xia Gaizun said, "In addition to his duties as a doctor, this doctor certainly has interests or a life of cultivation. In terms of interests, if he plays Go, he may want to read books about Go. If he likes literature and art, he may want to read poetry and novels. In terms of cultivation, if he aspires to cultivate his character, he will naturally read biographies of famous people or classic maxims. If he feels that his body must be exercised, he will naturally read books about swimming and sports. This is reading in terms of interests or cultivation."

If we are middle school students studying at school, then our duty is to study various subjects. The books we should read in our duties are the textbooks prescribed by the school for each subject. Reading textbooks is not an easy or simple task. We should read each textbook carefully.

Speaking of reference books, their need is temporary and does not need to be decided in advance. However, before we refer to them, we should ask ourselves what we must refer to. For example, as Xia Gaizun said, "Taking the Chinese language subject as an example, if we read a Peach Blossom Spring in the Chinese language textbook and there are unfamiliar words, we have to look up the dictionary. At this time, the dictionary (assuming it is the Ci Yuan) becomes a reference book. This article (Peach Blossom Spring) was written by someone from the Jin Dynasty. If we feel that the sentiments are somewhat different from the articles written by people from other times and want to know the situation of Jin Dynasty literature, we will look up the History of Chinese Literature (assuming it is Feng Wuliang's History of Chinese Literature). At this time, the History of Chinese Literature becomes a reference book. This article writes about a utopian idea. Because of the teachings of teachers and friends, we know that an English social thinker named Marles wrote a book called News from Nowhere, which is similar in nature to what Tao Qian wrote. If we take it out for comparison, then News from Nowhere becomes a reference book. This article belongs to the category of narration. If we want to understand the format of narrative writing, we can look up Narrative Writing Techniques (assuming it is compiled by Sun Liangong). At this time, Narrative Writing Techniques becomes a reference book. Also, the author of this article is called Tao Qian. If we want to know his character, we can look up the Biography of Tao Qian in the Book of Jin or the Collection of Tao. At this time, the Book of Jin or the Collection of Tao becomes a reference book."

2.  Standards for Choosing Books

The scope of books is very broad. Choosing them carefully is originally a very difficult task. Having the principles of selection, it is also necessary to have an appropriate standard. If there is no appropriate standard, sometimes I am afraid that it will inevitably be a waste of energy and time. According to Yu Tianxiu's opinion, the standards for choosing books are (1) do not be confused by propaganda, (2) do not be tempted by advertisements, (3) do not read books that are not beneficial, (4) do not read books that are not famous, (5) do not read books that still do not have a reputation after one year of publication, (6) do not read books that do not have a considerable introduction, (7) do not read ordinary books (this refers to beginners), (8) do not read books that are not similar to their own nature, (9) do not read non-excellent books, (10) do not read books that do not have value, (11) do not read books that do not contain good moral lessons, (12) do not read books that are not easy to understand, (13) do not read books that are not related to one's own life, (14) do not read books that lead people to evil, (15) do not read books whose benefits are not enough to compensate for the loss of time, (16) do not read books that cannot be applied, and (17) do not read books that are not equal to their own level. According to Zhu Qian's opinion, the standards for choosing books are: first, read modern books, do not read outdated books; second, read progressive books, do not read backward books; third, read general books, do not read too specialized books. The opinions of the above families are nothing more than generally similar. I think that since the scope of books is very broad, it is indeed not easy to list standards. For the sake of simplicity, it may be possible to divide the book area into four departments: (1) cultivating character, (2) increasing knowledge and skills, (3) cultivating sentiments and interests, and (4) training thinking.

Anecdotes

### New Words from a Parrot

— Wu Dai

The famous British biologist Julian Huxley was strolling around his house one day when he suddenly heard an air raid siren. Professor Huxley instinctively rushed to a safe place and looked up to the sky to see which direction the German planes were attacking from. As a result, he could not see the shadow of the plane or hear the sound of the plane dropping bombs. Huxley felt strange, so he used the spirit of a scientist to study this mysterious event. The result was that the air raid siren turned out to be emitted by a parrot in the house. Because it was so similar, the owner mistakenly thought it was a real air raid siren.

In recent months, it is said that British parrots in the war have also learned the sound of bombs falling very realistically, sometimes making the people in the house uneasy. Parrots were originally playthings of the idle class, but now they have become a nuisance. The war has affected every corner of the world and has increased the smart parrot's new vocabulary. But this may not be a good result for the future destiny of the parrot.

### Heart Change

— Jian Nong

Has my heart changed? Why is it so numb now?

Who injected a mesmerizing venom into my heart, paralyzing its compassionate consciousness? Who sowed the evil seeds of thorns in my heart, obscuring the roots of its sympathy?

Isn't my heart, which is the most easily moved, did once shed tears when I saw the ring of haggard people who were shivering and standing upright in the harsh north wind in front of the rice sale? Wasn't it once, when I saw the bored and lined up powder-coated meat screens under the drizzling rain opposite the Great World, that I felt sorrowful and wanted to cry? I also couldn't eat when I read the report that tens of millions of disaster victims in Hebei Province were digging up grass roots and bark to barely survive! I was also depressed all day because I saw the records that some famine victims in Sichuan Province were actually stealing and eating corpses! As for every time I think of the refugees in my country or Europe who are struggling under airplanes and cannons, that vivid picture of broken arms and legs, supporting the old and carrying the young, it makes me feel extremely sad.

But how long has it been? This heart of mine, which is still the same, has become indifferent to all of this, and is indifferent to it! Is it because it is commonplace, and my sensibility has been dulled by the "law of habit"? Is it because of disappointment and pessimism that I have adopted the view that "I am not concerned with what happens after I am gone"? ... No, no, not at all! It is because I deeply understand that crying and sorrow are of no benefit to the facts.

To be honest, what is the use of crying? Crying is just giving the "tear glands" a little work to do! - Even if you shed all your tears and then shed blood, will the pain of others be lessened because of this? What good is grief? Grief is just a few bubbles that appear and disappear in the rolling, countless waves of the "stream of consciousness," without leaving a trace! - Even if some traces are left, will the social environment be improved because of this?

Therefore, I will not only not cry or be sad in the future; I will cherish my tears and cherish my consciousness, because I want to demand a significant, or at least commensurate, price for them! That is to say, I want to transform this useless power hidden inside into a fighting power that can be expressed outside! I want to work hard to do some things that can benefit human society!

I know very well that I am just such a small ant in this great anthill of mankind; but I want to be a diligent worker ant! Even if it only carries a grain of food every day, it is considered to have exhausted its meager strength. I can see even more clearly that I am just such a humble bee in this great beehive of society; but I want to be a hardworking worker bee! Even if he only collects a little pollen every month, he has always done his best.

I also want to emulate the perseverance of the ox and the spirit of the horse. I want to move forward step by step, until I evaporate the last drop of sweat, pour out the last drop of blood, and swallow the last breath!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(7) Draw a Cross on Your Face

"Slow down, Master!" He immediately moved to Lao Yuan's side and said with a smile, "This is a concession, and it's not easy to clean up if something goes wrong; I have a plan that is even more satisfying than shooting him!"

Today, Ji Zhaoxiong really deserves to be a favorite of Yuan Baofan.

"Tell me! Tell me!"

"Let's not kill him, just use a knife to draw a cross on his face, so that he will never be able to see people from now on, that will be enough for him for the rest of his life!" This idea of Ji Zhaoxiong's was not just thought of at this moment. Before he informed Yuan Baofan, his other plan was to get a bottle of strong water to destroy Begonia's face, slightly venting his anger. Now that things have completely broken down, he feels that he can just change to using a knife quickly.

Yuan Baofan turned his head and glanced at Begonia's face, which although had turned gray, was still very delicate and handsome, and immediately nodded.

When Ji Zhaoxiong moved his feet, intending to rush out to get the knife, Begonia almost fainted again. Because he loves beauty by nature, if a heat sore accidentally grows on his face, or if he gets hurt somewhere, he feels like a stone is pressing on his heart, and he often keeps looking in the mirror, wishing he could change several kinds of medicine a day, until the sore heals, the blood scabs off, and there are indeed no traces left on his face, then he can sleep peacefully. Now Ji Zhaoxiong is so ruthless that he doesn't want Yuan Zhenshoushi to kill him simply, but wants to use a knife to draw a cross on his face. (98)

War

### Night Glasses

— Li Yi

In order to train the army to fight at night, the British have invented a kind of "night glasses". When soldiers wear this kind of glasses, they immediately look around, as if the black night has come to the earth. Wearing this kind of glasses for target practice can make soldiers familiar with the situation of night combat. The scenery at night is different from that in the daytime, and the sight of the rifle cannot be used. If you want to fight in this situation, you must have special training.

Household

### Our Home

— Hui Luo

I envy the sweet homes of others.

My father's slamming of tables, throwing furniture, tearing clothes, and my mother's loud crying, shouting, and jumping around are our daily homework. Whenever these times come, my younger siblings and I have no choice but to run out in a puff of smoke, and "hide" in the alley outside the back door for a while. Otherwise, no one can avoid the violent beatings from my father's rage. However, this is just like having malaria. When it breaks out, it is a mix of cold and heat, fierce and overwhelming. Once the time passes, it is like a sunny day after the rain. It often breaks out in the afternoon, and by dinner, they are already arm in arm, getting into the car to go to a night banquet.

My father is a doctor. He probably entered society very early, from a doctor's assistant to starting his own hospital. In the meantime, he went through quite a bit of struggle. However, when I was very young, I became familiar with my father's stories of stealing medicine during his assistant days, and the fraudulent tricks of injecting distilled water instead of vitamin preparations for patients, from the mouths of workers and nurses. Whenever my father proudly narrated his entrepreneurial journey, I would often have an extremely contemptuous aversion.

My mother studied nursing, but did not learn it well. Although she now has a doctor's license, few people seek her medical advice. However, she is very proud. I often hear her reprimanding nurses sternly, and she always mixes in the following words: "I am the hospital director's wife, I am a doctor, and I am also the head nurse. Who dares not listen to me?..." Although these can only damage her dignity, she never realizes it. Only after being beaten severely by my father does she become as weak as a lamb. Because of this, my grandparents dare not live with us.

Most of the arguments between my father and mother are about another woman. From the newly admitted students each year, my father is accustomed to seducing a female student to satisfy his desires. Once discovered by my mother, disputes arise. Then there is slamming of tables, tearing of clothes, throwing of furniture... After a considerable period of time, the strange thing is that my mother will actually help my father cleverly devise ways to evade the legal responsibilities he should bear, and drive the other woman away. How many innocent girls are trapped in the abyss of lifelong mental anguish, and we are also constantly worried about the disasters that these inevitable disputes bring us.

Now, my father has again selected one from the most recently admitted group of female students to live with him outside. I am very familiar with her. She is only one or two years older than me. My father seems particularly infatuated with her. Except for coming home for two hours of consultation during the day, he is rarely at home, leaving all the diagnostic work to two assistant doctors. My mother naturally often protests, and the result is still nothing more than slamming tables, tearing clothes, throwing furniture, and being beaten. But we can still hear her often triumphantly shouting: "I am the hospital director's wife, I am a doctor, I am the head nurse..."

When will I be able to leave my home?

### Introducing New Actors at the Carlton

— Jing

After Zhou Xinfang posted his resignation, the authorities invited the father and son of Yan Jupeng from Peking Opera to Shanghai to take over Zhou Xinfang's spot. All the actors and musicians, except Wang Xichun, remained the same. In addition to Yan Jupeng and Xiao Peng, Yan Jupeng brought with him the violinist Gao Zhengqing, drummer Wei Xiyun, supporting actor Ma Liankun, Wang Fushan, Lu Xicai, and Lu Hongrui. The Carlton also specially invited female actress Zhang Yiyun to perform opposite Yan Jupeng. I will briefly describe each person's art to inform fellow enthusiasts.

Yan Jupeng came from the amateur world. He has been immersed in Tan-style opera for decades. No one in the opera world is second to him in his study of pronunciation and purity of melody. Since Yu Shuyan imitated Tan-style opera and called himself the Yu school, Jupeng followed him and also established the Yan school. From then on, he incorporated his own ideas into Tan-style opera. In the past ten years, due to many family misfortunes and unfilial children, his voice has changed and his energy has weakened, and he is no longer as good as he used to be. Therefore, he has devoted himself to articulation and intonation. In recent years, his singing and modulation are flawless, which can be a model for future generations. However, because the words are too orthodox, the melody is therefore not round, and gradually becomes strange. Moreover, he imitates Tan's use of the Hunan and Hubei dialect too much, so that sometimes it does not resemble Peking Opera at all, and completely becomes Han opera. In recent years, seeing the decline of the opera world, he does not hesitate to risk his old life to struggle, and his spirit and perseverance are admirable.

Yan Xiaopeng is the younger brother of Shaopeng. He sings male warrior roles. He once belonged to Ding Yongli's school. His appearance and aura are excellent, but his foundation is slightly inferior, so he does not have many plays he can perform. He is a promising talent.

Zhang Yiyun is the younger sister of Zhang Eyun. When Eyun was performing in Beijing and Tianjin, Yiyun was only seven or eight years old. In the past five or six years, she has been influenced by her sister and taught by Furongcao Hu Tiefen, and her artistic skills have been able to glimpse the essence of Eyun's art. It is said that Zhang Shu's performance at the Carlton this time was introduced by a certain celebrity. The violinist Hu Tiefen and the drummer Wei Xiyun are both followers of Eyun.

Ma Liankun is Yan Jupeng's old partner. He plays both the copper hammer and the armored warrior roles. He is calm and experienced, and is invaluable. When he performs with Yan, he does his best to support him. His art is not weak, but he is limited by his talent and has not enjoyed great fame.

Wang Chenshan is the son of Wang Changlin. He follows his father's art and respects Yu Shuyan, so he is very good at accompanying Tan-style operas. In Beijing, in addition to working in the opera troupe, old Tan-style opera amateurs like to have him as their partner.

Lu Xicai is one of the six major disciples of the founding of the Fuliancheng Opera School. He specializes in the martial clown role. His martial arts skills are very good, and his belly is particularly broad. He once played Zhu Guangzu in "The Chain Trap," Hu Che'er in "Battle of Wancheng," Wang Dong in "Evil Tiger Village," the doomed general in "Changban Slope," Qin Ren in "Taking Gao Deng," and the groom in "Lianying Village." In addition to performing with Xiao Peng, he also directs Xiao Peng. Wu Jing Lu Hongrui, this is his first time coming to the South. His skills are mediocre, not as aggressive as Zhang Lianting or as fierce as Gao Shenghong.

The violinist is Gao Zhengqing, the cousin of Gao Shenglin. I dare not comment on his skill and technique because I have not heard him play. Drummer Wei San is one of the three famous drummers in the North. The three famous ones are Hang Zihe, Qiao Yuquan, and Wei Xiyun. Hang specializes in playing Yu-style male beard roles, so Wang Shaolou, Fei Xiaolin, Yang Baosen, and others treat him as their right-hand man. Qiao has been with Ma Lianliang for a long time, and his understanding is broader than Hang. In plays such as "Sweet Dew Temple," "A Pinch of Snow," and "Borrowing the East Wind," his wrist is flexible and his beats are clean. No drummer today can match him. Wei specializes in accompanying female actresses. All of Wang Yaoqing's disciples use Wei as their drummer, such as Wang Youqing, Hua Huilin, and Wang Yurong. In addition to being good at playing female roles, Wei is also able to play male roles, so Yan Jupeng also hired him as his drummer.

### A Note on Female Actress Li Guifen

— Yin'er

Ms. Li Guifen, who is performing on stage at the Golden Theater today, is a famous female actress from the old capital. She enjoyed fame early on, surpassing Meng Xiaodong, and was extremely popular for a time. Her gestures and bright voice were unparalleled. Therefore, at that time, her reputation was widely praised and she was famous throughout the old capital. After marrying, she stopped performing for many years. Who knew that good times would not last long, and her husband also died. Ms. Li went into seclusion in Shanghai, and had no interest in returning to the stage, nor did she interact with the outside world. Such an artist has been buried and unheard of, which is regrettable! The fans in Shanghai eagerly wanted to see her art again, so they initiated a grand gathering. Ai Shiju, Liu Binkun, Furongcao and others were her supporting cast. In addition, they invited the famous female amateur Gu Wenjuan to join in singing a section of "Female Escort." It is expected that tonight there will be heavy traffic and an unprecedented grand occasion.

### News from the Opera World in the Old Capital

— Yanzhao Landlord

Tan Fuying has returned to Beijing from Tianjin and is scheduled to perform at the Guangde Theater on May 7th. Hou Yulan is still invited to play the female lead.

Ma Youkun, the son of Ma Liankun, the supporting actor who came to Shanghai with Yan San, plays Tan-style old man roles. He has performed "Loss of Jieting, Empty City Stratagem, and Beheading Ma Su" at the Guanghe Theater.

Mao Shilai has compiled the plays of Fan Lihua into one book, renamed "Sisters-in-Law Heroes," and will play Fan Lihua himself. He will perform in the near future.

Since Yan Huizhu became a disciple of Zhu Guifang, she has specialized in Mei-style operas, and even the supporting actors are from the Mei Opera Troupe, such as Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua, Liu Lianrong, and Wang Shaoting.

Ren Zhiqi, a rising star female actress, is a disciple of Yu Lianxian and is very popular in Beijing.

Xiao Cheng Yanqiu Liu Yingqiu, Yu Shuang's proud disciple, has accepted an invitation from a friend to form a troupe and perform at the Guangde Theater. The play is "Scolding the Brocade Robe," which was written by Jiang Ouhong. The supporting actors are Zhao Deyu, Zhang Jin, Chen Shengtai, and Li Wenxi.

### Li Ming's Way Out

— Haixing

It is rumored that actor Li Ming of the National Drama Association has been hired by the Green Treasure Theater and will specialize in stage plays. However, this matter has not yet been decided. Although Green Treasure has invited him, Li Ming has been highly valued by the authorities since he performed "Loyalty and Righteousness for a Thousand Years" at the National Drama Association. Even if Green Treasure can give him a higher salary, it is naturally worth considering whether it is a good way out. I remember that Green Treasure once invited Xia Xia and was willing to give her a monthly salary of seven hundred yuan, but Xia Xia politely declined. She believes that the purpose of acting is at least not for money, but mostly for interest. Her willingness to work hard in drama is for interest.

Brief News (1) More than 50 painters and calligraphers in this city, including Shen Qiquan, Zhang Yanchang, Wang Lianyou, and Xiong Song, have jointly initiated the revival of the Hai Shang Ti Jin Painting and Calligraphy Society. It is scheduled to hold a gathering and dinner at the Gong De Lin Vegetarian Restaurant at 3:00 PM on the 7th of this month, and welcome foreign guests to enjoy the fun of painting and calligraphy together. (Planning) (2) The Jue Lu Pocket Song Compilation has been published yesterday, containing more than 20 famous songs. It is sold in Five Continents Bookstore and newspaper stands.

Famous amateur Shao Lushan, who is good at both singing and acting, is a backbone member of the Gu Feng Society. He will rehearse "Wulongyuan" at the company on Guizhou Road on the 11th of this month. The picture on the right is a photo of Shao Jun's performance.

Chapter 8: Falling Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water

Wang Yongtai then allowed Xu Jing to stay at his home. He also told him that because he had been widowed for many years, running around the world, alone, he had initially fallen ill here and lacked someone to serve him. Therefore, General Zhou Yuji had repeatedly advised him to take a concubine who could accompany him day and night. Then a fellow soldier introduced him to a woman surnamed He in this city, and he took her as his concubine and settled down here. Now that he had a family, how could he not laugh? Wang Yongtai said and laughed several times. Xu Jing said, "Uncle is old and should have someone to serve him. If he can give birth to a son in the future, continuing his lineage, it would be even more gratifying." Wang Yongtai laughed again and said, "This old man is used to being scattered and does not hope for children and grandchildren around his knees to comfort his twilight years. Fortunately, my younger brother is in Jiangling and has many sons, enough to succeed me. I am not afraid of becoming an unavenged ghost of the Ruo Ao clan. You are the son of my close friend, and like family, let me introduce you so you can get to know each other." Xu Jing said, "It is appropriate for your nephew to pay his respects." Wang Yongtai then excitedly led Xu Jing to the back hall and ordered the maid to quickly invite Lady He to come out. After a while, the sound of pendants was heard, and several maids escorted a young woman out to meet them: her hair was like clouds and black as ink, so shiny it could be used as a mirror, apricot face and peach cheeks, willow eyebrows and phoenix eyes, she was extremely beautiful, her figure was also very graceful, her age was no more than twenty or so, and she was dressed in beautiful clothes and accessories, extremely gorgeous. Xu Jing quickly paid his respects. Lady He also returned the greeting. Wang Yongtai pointed to Xu Jing and said to Lady He, "This is Xu Jing, the son of an old friend. He has come here to join the army and is staying at my house. You should treat him well." Lady He responded in a charming voice. After sitting and talking for a few words, Xu Jing asked to be excused and left, and was led by a servant to sit in the guest room. Before long, a maid brought out quilts and pillows to tidy up the bed for Xu Jing and make the bedding, and then left. That night, Xu Jing stayed at Wang Yongtai's house. After breakfast the next day, Wang Yongtai led Xu Jing to the general's office to see Zhou Yuji. Xu Jing saw that Zhou Yuji had a fair face, ape arms, and a wasp waist, and was born with an awe-inspiring demeanor, worthy of being a good defender of the country. He hurriedly bowed down. Zhou Yuji personally helped him up and invited him to sit on the side. Wang Yongtai first explained Xu Jing's background and origin to Zhou Yuji, and then talked about his desire to join the army, asking Zhou Yuji to employ him. Zhou Yuji saw that Xu Jing's character was outstanding and nodded in approval, and said, "Now is the time when the country needs people, and ambitious people will not be willing to hide their talents and be buried in the grass. Swing my horizontal spear and sweep away those bandits. It is good that you have come, I need good talents here, so I will have to trouble you to temporarily stay under my command as a Yunqi Wei. If you have merit in the future, you can be promoted." Xu Jing said, "Thank you for your cultivation, I am willing to serve you." So he excused himself and left. From then on, Xu Jing served under Zhou Yuji's command. (55)
