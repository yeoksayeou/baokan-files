### People from China and Burma Organize Yunnan-Burma Highway Committee; Aims to Unify Transportation on the Entire Route; Head of American Red Cross, Baker, to Serve as Chairman

Hong Kong - According to reliable Chinese sources, the Yunnan-Burma Highway Committee, jointly formed by Chinese and Burmese individuals, is currently being organized. The purpose of the committee is to unify transportation on the entire route. It is said that transportation on the road is facing great obstacles due to the lack of a proper organization. Baker, the head of the American Red Cross in China, has been nominated as the chairman of the committee, but Mr. Baker has not accepted the position because he needs to wait for permission from the American Red Cross headquarters in New York. Mr. Baker recently came to Hong Kong with Cooley, an administrative assistant to President Roosevelt. When asked about this news, he refused to comment or deny it. It is noted that Mr. Baker was known worldwide eleven years ago for organizing and leading the Yangtze River flood relief efforts. He transported 600,000 tons of American barley and flour to the flood-stricken areas for distribution. (4th United Press Dispatch)

It has been decided to implement passport checks on the Sino-Burmese border on April 1 of this year. From then on, Chinese citizens going to Burma, whether by land or by plane, must obtain passports and have them signed by the consulate before departing. (3rd Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Abnormal International Situation and Crisis

Germany has managed to circumvent and eliminate resistance from the Soviet Union, Turkey, and other international actors, and in one fell swoop has occupied Bulgaria, completing another blitzkrieg on the international stage. This was an inevitable development following the signing of a non-aggression pact between Turkey and Bulgaria, so the surprising point is not Germany's entry into Bulgaria, but the sudden change in Turkey's attitude prior to this. The rapid visits to the Balkans by Britain's Eden and Dill were attempts to remedy and plug this loophole. Now that Bulgaria's fate has been determined, other possible developments in the area are being actively brewing. What is noteworthy is: after the appearance of the German army on the Turkish border, what will Turkey's considerations regarding its strategic position, and the Soviet Union's position in this regard, be? Secondly, Bulgaria's acceptance of German control this time is in the form of joining the so-called "New Order"; the buffer zone between the Soviet Union, Turkey, and the New Order has been removed, and the Axis powers have advanced rapidly into the Balkans and the Near East. Therefore, the two countries have reached a critical juncture where they must choose either to recognize or oppose the New Order; the room for maneuver is shrinking, and the crisis of war is becoming more pressing. So, what will the two countries do?

Strictly speaking, this time is a temporary victory for Germany on the one hand, and on the other hand, in addition to the blows suffered by Britain and Greece, the loss of strategic position and the crisis of security incurred by the Soviet Union and Turkey are also very serious. Tracing the source, the failure to adjust relations between Britain and the Soviet Union has been the greatest root of the unfortunate situation encountered by Britain, Greece, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Bulgaria, and its harm is still developing continuously. Perhaps more shocking international events will occur, giving the Axis powers the opportunity to break through individually. How to catch up quickly, how to adjust relations with each other, and how to unify each other's steps are not only urgent issues for Britain and Greece at present, but also urgent issues for the Soviet Union and Turkey.

Judging solely from the situation in the Balkans, the effect of Germany's dispatch of troops to Bulgaria is clearly to save Italy; its second step will probably be to pressure Greece to accept the proposal to negotiate peace with Italy, rather than directly using force against Greece. This can be inferred from the various statements issued by Germany, Italy, Turkey, and Bulgaria in recent days. However, the outcome has a very large fork in the road: one is that Britain and Greece, due to various reasons, reluctantly submit in Greece; one is that Britain and Greece resolutely resist to the end, awaiting the outcome on the battlefield; and one is that Turkey resolutely opposes Germany's attack on Greece with force, and the Soviet Union fully supports Turkey's position at the same time. Each of the three paths has its own reasonable grounds. The key depends on how effective Eden's activities in Ankara a few days ago and currently in Athens are; and the actual actions of Britain and Greece in the near future will provide the world with a concrete answer. The impact of this will also have a great impact on the situation in the Far East. Eastern violentists may see this as an opportunity to threaten Britain and the United States and brazenly advance south, and to work hard to adjust relations with the Soviet Union. Both are essential.

The latest news last night is that the Soviet Union, Turkey, Britain, and other countries have all separately stated their firm positions, which is an important sign of improvement in the international situation; however, this mere verbal and written statement is absolutely not enough to stem the deterioration; the improvement of the situation and the follow-up momentum of the signs depend on the close and rapid coordinated action of those who oppose violence!

### The Second National Political Consultative Conference: Chairman Chiang's Speech - Striving for Final Victory and Achieving Secure National Defense

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) In the current global upheaval, China's position has been elevated due to more than three years of bloody battles. However, China's responsibilities have also increased accordingly. In recent years, China has not only been a pioneer in defending peace but also a vanguard. At this time, it further proves that China is a major force in defending Eastern peace and justice. China's resolute and effective operations have not only increased the world's sympathy and trust in us but have also brought China into closer relations with all countries with common interests. China's operations are no longer an isolated event but have become a major factor in the world's safety and order. Under this new situation, I would like to ask all my fellow councilors and compatriots across the country to jointly recognize our country's goals and make further efforts. What are our goals? I solemnly tell you: First, the war must strive for final victory. Second, national construction must achieve absolute national defense security. The country to be built by the Three Principles of the People is one with solid national defense, developed civil rights, and prosperous people's livelihood. The national defense construction of the Three Principles of the People is for the purpose of self-defense, so it not only does not hinder civil rights and people's livelihood but is precisely to enable civil rights and people's livelihood to obtain true and permanent solutions under the guarantee of national defense security. Today, although our national strength has made great progress, and the international situation is also very favorable, in order to strive for our final victory, adapt to the world situation, and fulfill our greater responsibilities as China, we must require our national people to have a thorough self-awareness. We must know that our past efforts are not enough to meet the needs of the future. We must require the people to realize that only by completing our absolute and complete national defense can we complete all of our war and nation-building work. Therefore,

All construction must be national defense-oriented, and all citizens must be militarized. Based on this understanding, I would like to put forward the following opinions to you, hoping that they will be widely disseminated to compatriots across the country. First, in the political aspect, our national compatriots must recognize that all party concepts and the so-called left-leaning and right-leaning ideologies and theories are outdated and cannot adapt to today's world. We must face the grim reality of the world and accept the painful lessons of the war, with the construction of an absolutely secure national defense as the primary goal. The European war proved that only countries that can fight and win can maintain their independent survival; otherwise, they will be conquered and enslaved. Moreover, due to the progress of modern military technology and the strictness of economic control, once conquered, there will never be hope of regaining independence through one's own efforts. Today, the conquered nations will never be able to turn over, which is absolutely different from twenty or thirty years ago. Therefore, today, only politics suitable for combat is the politics of the new era, and only the ability to defend oneself can guarantee democracy. If one cannot fight, democracy is meaningless. Just look at the people who have already lost their country. What qualifications do they have to talk about democracy? Similarly, capital and labor in conquered countries all belong to the conquerors, and all political propositions become useless once the country is lost. The primary goal of the national revolution pursued by the Chinese Kuomintang is to save the country and seek freedom and equality for China. Therefore, the Chinese Kuomintang has consistently taken

Consolidating popular strength and strengthening national defense as its mission, not only has it always understood the importance of national defense and called out to the people, but now it is also organizing compatriots across the country to wage an unprecedented bloody war of self-defense. In order to accomplish this mission, there is absolutely no room for party prejudice. It only requires all compatriots to strive together towards the sole goal of defending the country. On the government's side, it should rectify discipline to improve administrative efficiency and promote local democracy to establish the foundation of democracy. Although the National Assembly has been postponed, this is precisely to make the government take on greater responsibility to step up the promotion of local autonomy below the county level and create a strong grassroots organization throughout the country. The trend of the times has arrived, and we cannot but assume unprecedentedly difficult responsibilities. At the same time, we must also require all citizens to confirm the truth that the nation and national defense come first, abandon all outdated concepts that do not fit the times, and make the whole country a unified and strong combat entity, proving that China is a great force capable of self-defense and maintaining righteousness and peace. Second, in the military aspect, we must require all citizens to raise their awareness and faith in national defense, and we must require that the thoughts, actions, knowledge, and skills of all citizens meet the needs of a national war and serve to strengthen national defense forces together. In the future, the center of nation-building will be military construction, and politics, economy, education, culture, and national life must also be organized in a wartime manner to cooperate and advance with the military construction cause. Therefore, on the one hand, we should

Strengthen the army, reorganize training, enrich military strength, reform the conscription system, popularize military training, and improve combat skills. On the other hand, we must only raise national defense awareness and combat discipline to complete the mission of building the nation and the army. Third, in the economic aspect, we must take advantage of this wartime opportunity to establish the foundation of a national defense economy and, based on national defense needs, quickly complete the work of economic construction. This kind of wartime economic construction is not only limited to the current war period but must be extended to the post-war period until the day when an absolutely secure defensive national defense is achieved. In order to achieve this goal, the government should take various steps to adjust production and finance, improve transportation and transportation, and require all compatriots across the country to be universally frugal, work hard, concentrate capital, popularize labor, and further require the government and the people to work together to protect resources, develop military industry, improve national production capacity, implement necessary institutions for all economic activities, cultivate national strength, stabilize people's livelihood, and make the entire national strength continue to grow to adapt to the needs of national defense construction and support the progress of our economic construction. I also deeply believe that the consolidation and development of China's economy will be of great benefit to the whole world. The Father of the Nation's industrial plan put forward at the end of the First World War is not only the basic policy for the government to carry out national defense construction, but, looking at the overall situation, it is impossible not to fully realize this plan. Because the scale of this war is far greater than the previous European war, if the machinery and technology after the end of the war can be imported into China to develop China's economy, it can not only solve the panic and scramble caused by economic imbalances in the world but also lay the foundation for a century of peace in East Asia. However, this requires our country to establish a national defense economic foundation during the war and be able to work together to endure hardships and pains in order to complete the basic cause of wartime construction. Countries that do not work hard on their own are not qualified to hope for

Foreign capital, technological assistance and cooperation, even if there is, it is not equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. This is what we should deeply understand. In addition, whether in education and culture, or in national life, whether the government or the people, must make greater efforts based on this aspect. We must discuss and promote national morality, promote scientific knowledge and skills, popularize national education, and reward labor services, so that the country can fulfill its great duty of building national defense. We must comfort the wounded and dead, relieve disasters, give preferential treatment to anti-Japanese families, protect women and children, and promote health and sports to seek the safety and health of the population. In short, today, if we cannot fight, we will surely perish. Without national defense, there is no country. Without national defense, we cannot guarantee the survival of the nation, let alone protect civil rights and people's livelihood. The fundamental spirit of the Three Principles of the People is to consolidate national defense security to protect the welfare of the people. All our policies and all our facilities must be centered on national defense. All right and wrong must be judged according to national defense. Our army must become a highly national defense force. Our politics must become the general institution for mobilizing national defense forces. Our economy must be the greatest source for cultivating national defense forces. Our compatriots must also have

Combat knowledge, the determination to sacrifice for the country, and abide by the national laws and regulations. All cultural and educational undertakings must also meet the needs of national defense and become a part of national defense. We want to build a country with full national defense to protect civil rights and people's livelihood. We must reduce our personal lives to the lowest limit and exert our personal energy to the highest limit. We must abandon backward, narrow, self-interested factional concepts, and correct corrupt, lax, and decadent habits, so that the whole country becomes a strong combat entity, and then we can achieve the goal of driving out the Japanese army. Therefore, in the future, our country's administrative policy, on the one hand, must thoroughly implement the program of resistance and construction, and on the other hand, must also aim at creating a sound national defense. I deeply believe that in the future, our country must be more united in will and action. We must mobilize and organize the national forces to strive for the final victory to ensure the realization of the Three Principles of the People. At the same time, we must cooperate closely with all countries and nations that oppose the policy of aggression to jointly defend the peace of the world and East Asia. Gentlemen and councilors, today the whole world is encountering a great change, and our China is engaged in a desperate struggle. In terms of the world, the spiritual and material life of all countries will have

Great changes, all political and economic theories, will also have great changes, but one thing is undoubted, that only a country with a strong new-style military force and a modern organization can protect itself and survive, and all ideas and actions that weaken combat power and are not suitable for national combat will be eliminated by the times. In terms of our China, our country has the advantage of having a vast land, a large population, and abundant resources, and it is fortunate that it has already launched a war of national self-defense. The spirit and will of the people are adapting to the struggle of the new era. Internationally, we also have strong and loyal sympathy and assistance. It can be said that the future of our country has unfolded with great light and hope. However, the key to victory lies entirely in whether our national people can fully recognize the new world situation and make new efforts. During this period when the world is changing and the war is becoming more intense, at the first meeting of this Political Consultative Conference, I would like to express my beliefs to you gentlemen and compatriots across the country, hoping that this Political Consultative Conference will understand the times, be based on national needs, pool wisdom, make many contributions, assist the government, lead the people, and realize the ambition of our entire nation to strive for the final victory and complete the construction of national defense.

### The Balkan War Approaches: Turkey Determined to Resist Aggression, German Troops Rapidly Advance Towards Greek-Turkish Border, Building Positions Along the Struma River Valley

London: Last night, Ankara Radio broadcast that the German occupation of Bulgaria was another incident of murdering the freedom of small nations, stating that the real reason for Germany's aggression in the Balkans was that German leaders had decided victory in the West was impossible. Therefore, they must explore other avenues, hoping to discover any exploitable gaps in Britain's defenses. The Axis powers' intention in spreading the war to the Balkan Peninsula was solely to draw a large part of the world into the vortex. Bulgarians may now believe they can avoid war, but will soon awaken and discover their country has become a battlefield filled with terror. Turkey's position has long been decided. The Turkish people are now calmly observing the situation and deeply believe that their leaders' recent actions will not alter the final outcome in the slightest. (Reuters, 4th)

Ankara: Turkey is paying extremely close attention to the situation arising from the German occupation of Bulgaria. It is widely expected that Turkey will soon adopt various special defense measures to protect its interests. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu recently stated that Bulgaria, as Turkey's neighbor, seems to be within Turkey's security zone. (Reuters, 4th)

Sofia: It is reported that grey German troops were seen traversing the mountains and plains this morning, advancing through Bulgaria towards Macedonia. A large-scale Balkan war seems imminent. It is reported that the vanguard has already established positions on the Bulgarian border, from where they can enter Greece through the mountains. (United Press, 4th)

Sofia: The German vanguard is advancing rapidly in Bulgaria to accelerate the showdown between the Allied and Axis powers, precisely as Bulgaria quietly observes its Independence Day. It is reported that German mechanized detachments have established forward outposts south of Sofia and in the Struma River Valley, close to the Greek border. According to sources here, some German troops are moving towards the Turkish border. The German troops who have reached certain locations in the Struma River Valley are reportedly establishing battle positions, which are less than sixty miles from Thessaloniki. (International News Service, 8th)

Sofia: The German vanguard, consisting of the 11th to 15th divisions, passed through Bulgaria yesterday in transport vehicles, consolidating its forward positions at six locations on the Greek-Bulgarian border. The exact locations of these positions are currently unknown. However, according to sources close to the Axis powers, they are near Kulata, Dala Yev, Bama, and Nevrokop. It is believed that German troops have occupied Velingrad on the Greek-Bulgarian border. It is also said that Germany currently does not wish to take any action hostile to Turkey. (Central News Agency, 4th)

Sofia: Rumors circulated in Sofia yesterday that twenty German divisions had entered Bulgaria, with fifteen divisions advancing towards the Greek border. These rumors are clearly part of a Nazi psychological warfare campaign against Turkey. Military experts here say that such a large force is logically impossible, because the three highways Germany has acquired in Bulgaria could not have transported fifteen divisions in this period. Moreover, fifteen German divisions could not be immediately deployed on the Turkish border, where Bulgarian troops have never been stationed. Military experts believe that it is possible that five German divisions have moved to the border. (Reuters, 4th)

Berlin: According to a telephoned report received by the Havas News Agency from someone who witnessed German troops entering Bulgaria, the German vanguard entered Bulgaria amidst northwesterly winds. The roads were frozen, but the vehicles advanced continuously. Damaged vehicles were repaired by repair teams accompanying the troops. The German troops experienced great hardship passing through the mountainous areas. (Havas, 4th)

Moscow: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky yesterday gave the following reply to Bulgarian Minister to the Soviet Union, Stamenov: "On March 1, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ardinoff declared to the Soviet Minister to Bulgaria that the Bulgarian government had indeed agreed to the entry of German troops into Bulgarian territory, stating that the purpose of this move was to ensure peace in the Balkans. Regarding this matter, the Soviet government believes it is necessary to make the following response: (1) The Soviet government does not agree with the Bulgarian government's assertion that its position is correct. Whatever the Bulgarian government's true intentions, this position will not consolidate peace. On the contrary, the position taken by the Bulgarian government will expand the war and drag Bulgaria itself into the conflict. (2) Based on this point, in order to maintain its peace policy, the Soviet government cannot provide any assistance to the Bulgarian government's implementation of the above policy. Recently, Bulgarian newspapers have spread false rumors, fundamentally distorting the Soviet Union's true position. Therefore, the Soviet government has no choice but to make the above statement." (TASS, 4th)

Washington: Some interpret the Soviet Union's statement regarding the entry of German troops into Bulgaria as a warning not to interfere with Turkey and the Dardanelles. However, well-informed sources express doubt that they will actively intervene against the German advance into Greece. (Reuters, 4th)

London: The news of the Soviet Union's condemnation of Bulgaria's actions arrived too late, and most newspapers did not have time to comment. However, the "Daily Telegraph" reported that Turkey must recognize this news as an important guarantee for the security of its northeastern border. Mr. Batterworth also published an article in the "News Chronicle," stating that the Soviet Union's declaration may be intended to warn Germany, but it may also be a disclaimer that the Soviet officialdom could not support Bulgaria. (Reuters, 4th)

London: Diplomatic circles here stated today that the Soviet Union is making its greatest diplomatic effort to ensure that German troops in the Balkans move westward rather than towards the Dardanelles. Political observers here said that, according to news from Moscow, the Soviet Union has been alarmed by the potential danger of Germany occupying Bulgaria. The indirect buffer zone between the Soviet Union and Germany is becoming narrower, and the Soviet Union's nerves are becoming more sensitive. Some diplomats believe that the Soviet Union's protest to Bulgaria is "a significant change in Soviet foreign policy." Other diplomats said this is merely a superficial show to please Britain and the United States. The diplomatic correspondent of the British Newspaper Association said skeptically today, "Those who are keenly aware of the Balkan situation still do not believe that the Soviet Union's protest is a prelude to its actions." It is pointed out that the protest was made to Bulgaria, not to occupying Germany. However, most political commentators in London unanimously believe that, despite the German-Soviet pact, the Soviet Union's protest is a clear reflection of Soviet unease.

Carrying Hitler's Letter: German Special Envoy Arrives in Ankara

Istanbul: A German Henkel bomber carrying a special envoy with German diplomatic documents arrived here. The special envoy immediately took a fast train to Ankara. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)

Budapest: According to news received here from Istanbul, the messenger carrying a special letter from Hitler to the Turkish President was brought to Istanbul last night by a German plane. According to reports, this letter is intended to reassure Turkey of Germany's peaceful intentions in the Balkans. (International News Service, 4th)

Recognizing the Agreement with Bulgaria as Invalid: Turkey Actively Makes Military Preparations

New York: According to a broadcast from an American radio station here, semi-official sources in Ankara claimed that after Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, German troops immediately entered Bulgarian territory. Therefore, Turkey believes that the non-aggression pact previously established between Turkey and Bulgaria is now invalid, because Bulgaria has lost its independence in terms of its domestic situation. Turkey is no longer bound by this non-aggression pact. If German troops attack Greece or Turkish territory, Turkey will have no choice but to resist with force. (Havas, 3rd)

Ankara: According to unconfirmed reports, British bombers visited Varna, a Black Sea port in Bulgaria. Turkey has officially ordered the mobilization of the third-tier reserves, while ordering the demobilization of another three tiers of soldiers. Officials deny the rumor that mines have been laid in the Dardanelles Strait. However, ships passing through the area must be piloted by Turkish pilots. Well-informed sources believe that British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of Staff Dill have agreed with Turkey that, if Germany attacks Greece, British warships will have the right to pass through the Dardanelles Strait, and British land and air forces can obtain bases in Turkey. (United Press, 4th)

Istanbul: The newspapers here continue to focus on Bulgaria's adherence to the Axis Pact. "The Tanin" states that Bulgaria's move is "the prelude to aggression in the Balkans, and Turkey must be doubly vigilant." The "People's Party Organ" states that Bulgaria has long intended to join the pact. However, the date of Bulgaria's enslavement was only decided at this moment. Other newspapers all say that Bulgaria signed the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact, but the ink was barely dry before it took this recent action. What is the reason? It must be explained. "The Ulus" states that the Turkish-Bulgarian agreement reiterates Bulgaria's intention not to resolve issues with neighboring countries by force. However, this depends entirely on how the obligations contained in the German-Italian-Japanese alliance with Bulgaria are implemented. The British-Turkish alliance has helped maintain peace in the Balkans and the Middle East. It is still hoped that Bulgaria will use its influence and utilize the two-nation pact to maintain peace. (Reuters, 4th)

Moscow: Observers here believe that the Soviet Union's note is merely intended to express its opposition to Germany's actions and to draw the Axis powers' attention to the fact that the Soviet Union has not abandoned its interests in the Balkans. It is widely expected that the Soviet Union will not take any action beyond "paper protests" at this time. (International News Service, 4th)

Nazi Troops Pressing the Border: Aiming to Force Greece to Seek Peace

Sofia: Greek diplomatic circles here say that they have not yet heard of Germany exerting diplomatic pressure on Athens. It is expected that this pressure will begin when the Nazi divisions arrive at the Greek border. The number of German troops arriving in Sofia is still very small. (Reuters, 4th)

New York: Germany's recent actions in the Balkans have clearly indicated that Hitler is using the highest degree of pressure to intimidate Greece into suing for peace with Italy. Bulgaria's accession to the Axis powers and the concentration of German troops in Bulgarian territory have naturally caused extreme panic in Greece, which recently lost its national leader (Prime Minister Metaxas), and it urgently needs to decide between war and peace. Observers are speculating whether Metaxas's successor, Koryzis, can continue Metaxas's work under the pressure of the formidable German army. What Greece needs now is a strong and capable outstanding person to take charge of the government and maintain the spirit of war without faltering. However, in recent weeks, the Greek army's operations in Albania have slackened. This cannot be entirely blamed on the lack of leadership of the authorities, because the severe winter and ice and snow have greatly hindered the war. At the same time, Italian reinforcements have arrived in large numbers, strengthening the defenses. But if Heaven had granted more time, and Metaxas had not fallen like a star, then the Greek army would have likely conquered Tepelena by now. Metaxas was not only a supreme strategist, but also had the ability to lead the country and a strong will, and was the mainstay of the resistance. In today's Balkan situation, Greece must not only continue its previous fighting spirit, but also unite internally. Although there were many political enemies of Metaxas during his lifetime, due to his great personality, there was no open resistance. Today, Germany is making every effort to undermine Greece's unity and incite various opposition factions to fight each other. This is the reason why the German embassy is still maintained in Athens, because this allows for propaganda and diplomatic activities. In the near future, Greece will likely be persuaded to sue for peace again. This has been tried two or three times before. In the Germans' minds, a prime minister from a banking background should be easier to intimidate and entice than a prime minister from a military background. But so far, they have not succeeded. Perhaps Greece's decision will depend on the amount of aid that Britain and the United States can provide. (United Press, 4th)

British and Greek Authorities Continue Talks: Greece Determined to Resist to the End

Athens: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Eden's talks with the Greek authorities began on Sunday night and ended after midnight. Talks will continue this afternoon. British Imperial Chief of Staff General Dill also attended the meeting. It is widely expected that Eden and Dill will stay here for several days. The public's welcome is extremely enthusiastic. (Reuters, 4th)

Athens: The morning newspapers here today mostly published commentaries stating that, despite the development of events in the Balkans making the situation difficult and arduous, Greece will continue to fight. Observers believe that the newspapers' comments are sufficient to reflect the true sentiments of the Greek people. These people also said that this sentiment also reflects the views expressed by the new Prime Minister Koryzis in his broadcast to the United States last Saturday. The new Prime Minister said in the broadcast that Greece has been fighting fiercely since the war broke out four months ago. Our victory will be celebrated by the world, because this victory is a victory of justice over brutality. (United Press, 4th)

Germany Coercing and Enticing: Southern Country in Difficult Situation

Southern Capital: Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday at his private residence in Slovenia (near the Yugoslav-Hungarian border). This news was learned from reliable sources, and it is confirmed that Prince Paul left the Southern Capital by special train on Sunday night, heading north. However, the Southern National Intelligence Agency officially denied reports of a meeting between Paul and Ribbentrop last night. (Reuters, 4th)

Southern Capital: Reliable sources here stated today that Germany is demanding that the Southern Country issue a declaration beneficial to the Axis powers, stating that this move will not only safeguard the country's territorial status quo, but also obtain the important Greek military port of Thessaloniki. High-ranking Southern Country officials said that the Southern Country may join the Axis powers, but this is a matter of weeks, not days. (United Press, 4th)

Southern Capital: As the German army in the Balkans sweeps southward through Bulgaria, Nazi diplomatic cannons have been fired at both the Southern Country and Turkey. The purpose is clearly to get these Slavic peoples to quickly join the Axis camp and to reconcile with the Turkish people. The Southern Country is now in a clear dilemma between continuing to maintain neutrality and joining the Axis front. According to reliable sources, German Ambassador to the South, Hiren, has held talks with the leader of the Croatian independence movement. Hiren has begun to create another Sudetenland region in the Croatian region of the Southern Country. It is also said that Germany has asked the Southern Country to mediate the Greek-Italian war. According to diplomatic circles here, it will become clear in the next few days whether there will be war in the Balkans when the situation unfolds. (International News Service, 4th)

### London Times Discusses the Balkan Situation: The Nazi Military Leaders' Future Actions Are Expected to Follow Only Three Paths

London: The Times commented on the future actions in the Balkans, stating that British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Chief of Staff General Dill were able to prove Turkey's firm loyalty to the British alliance in Ankara and discuss how to make the alliance effective in responding to the new German threat. Eden and Dill's visit to Athens also has the same purpose, and there are various reasons to expect that this trip will achieve the same results. The German invasion of Bulgaria cannot stop there. Nazi military leaders seem to have three paths to follow, namely, attacking Yugoslavia, Greece, or Turkey. Although Yugoslavia once adopted a policy of leaning towards Germany to counter Italy a few years ago, Germany has never won the hearts of the Yugoslav people. Moreover, the Yugoslav people are inherently not subdued by intimidation. Joining the Axis powers will be the most unpopular action. Belgrade has made every effort to deny any intention of taking this path. However, the Southern Country's strategic position is now completely surrounded by the Axis powers, with German troops facing its border with Bulgaria, making it extremely difficult. Rumors that Nazi troops have concentrated in various locations outside the Greek border may be the beginning of an invasion or the initial demonstration before issuing an ultimatum, which is unknown. The Greek General Staff and the British authorities who are consulting with it have thoroughly reviewed the above possibilities. No terrain in the Balkans is like the flat plains of Poland or northern France, where German mechanized units can gallop. Natural obstacles can provide tremendous help to a small number of resolute defenders. The Greek army's performance in Albania makes full use of the terrain of the mountains, but British assistance on land and in the air is also necessary. This assistance will be provided as much as possible. The talks currently taking place in Athens have undoubtedly discussed this in detail. As for when Turkey can put its great resources to the most advantageous use, the Turkish government and General Staff have thoroughly discussed this in their long talks with the two British dignitaries. It must be understood that Turkey cannot be unaffected by the blows that Germany is inflicting on Greece. Now that Britain has eliminated the threat to its bases in Egypt and the momentum of the winter war, it must unite its two allies in the Near East to jointly prepare to deal with the spring offensive predicted by Hitler in his recent speech.

### British-Bulgarian Relations on the Brink of Rupture: Bulgarian Ambassador to Britain Resigns and is Approved

Sofia: Non-official circles expect that British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, will announce the formal severance of British-Bulgarian relations today. Because the severance of relations between the two countries is imminent, British citizens in Sofia were busy yesterday preparing to leave the country, likely traveling to Istanbul via Burgas. Currently, there are only three British citizens in Sofia, apart from the approximately fifty personnel from the two embassies and consulates. (Reuters, 4th)

London: Bulgarian Minister to Britain, Momtchilov, resigned from the Bulgarian government due to his disapproval of the Bulgarian government's policy of joining the Axis powers. Yesterday, he received a reply from Sofia formally accepting his resignation. (Reuters, 4th)

### Turkey's New Budget: Defense Expenditure Increases Sharply

Moscow: The Turkish government's 1941 budget is 304,971,000 Turkish Lira, which is a significant increase from the 268,476,000 Turkish Lira in 1940. It is said that most of the increase is used for military purposes. (TASS, 4th)

### Rumors of Thai-Vietnamese Border Disputes to End in a Few Days: Vichy Accepts Thai Demands in Principle, Japanese Advance Southward May Take This as a Turning Point

Saigon: Lieutenant Colonel Koike, Secretary-General of the Japanese Military Delegation in Vietnam, recently told a United Press reporter that French representatives in Tokyo will sign a peace treaty with Thailand tomorrow or Thursday. (French officials said that Thailand's demands had been somewhat altered as a result of the French side insisting on its views, despite the expiration of the ultimatum's deadline. These people believe that the Vichy government has agreed in principle to the demands made by Thailand and Japan, and has ordered French representatives in Tokyo to sign a treaty that will result in significant losses of French territory.) Koike said, "I dare to assert that the French representatives in Tokyo will be able to sign a peace treaty tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Vichy has accepted the demands of Japan and Thailand in principle. Vietnam will cede a portion of its land, but not as much as Thailand originally demanded." He further said that Japan had sent an ultimatum to Vietnam, but he did not believe that the ultimatum threatened that Japan would take military action if the French side refused to accept it. He said, "If Japan had threatened with war, then Japan would have already attacked by the time the ultimatum expired if the French side had not yet yielded." Koike said that the Japanese residents in Saigon have been extremely alarmed in the past few days. Koike also accused French soldiers and detectives of insulting and assaulting Japanese people. Several Japanese people have suffered swollen eyes, injuries, and even had their teeth knocked out. "I really don't know why the French hate the Japanese," he said. He also said that Japanese residents will not withdraw from Vietnam. Koike also denied reports that the Japanese were continuing to ship large quantities of military supplies to Thailand, saying that this was natural because Thailand has no factories. Authoritative sources also said that there are now more than 300 Japanese aircraft at Japanese airfields in Hanoi and Haiphong. (United Press, 4th)

Vichy: It was learned today that the French government hopes that Japan will stipulate the protection of French and Vietnamese people in the ceded territories in the mediation plan. Official news from Tokyo said that the Japanese Foreign Minister is discussing the wording of the final agreement with the French Ambassador. The Japanese side will send this final agreement to Vichy and Bangkok. Official news said that the French side will request that the status of French and indigenous people in the ceded territories be stipulated in the final agreement. The French government has accepted the Japanese mediation plan as the basis for resolving the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. It is believed that the French government wants to allow the French and Vietnamese people in the ceded territories to move their assets to French territory. However, this approach involves rubber plantations owned by French and Vietnamese people. It is believed that the French government wants to ensure that the Thai government will compensate these rubber planters. (United Press)

Washington: Observers here said that, given the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, France finally succumbed to Japan. It remains to be seen what Japan will do in the future and how it will expand its power in Vietnam. Although Thailand gained much from France's concessions, what Japan gained from France's concessions is no less than Thailand, or even more than Thailand. Whether Japan will now advance southward is still a matter of speculation here. If Japan continues to advance southward, then Britain will undoubtedly want to resist it. This is unquestionable. Reliable sources say that if the Dutch East Indies are attacked, they will formally declare war. It is said that the Dutch East Indies' first-line air force has several hundred new American aircraft, which are superior to those possessed by Japan. Therefore, the claim that the Dutch East Indies will declare war is not without basis. The only question now is what the United States will do if Japan intends to seize Singapore or the Dutch East Indies. It is believed that the United States is currently deliberately trying to keep Japan guessing. However, judging from the sentiment here, it would be risky to conclude that the United States will not act. At the same time, the internal situation in China remains a matter of concern. News about the friction between the Nationalists and Communists is quite complex and contradictory. Sympathy here tends towards Chongqing, hoping that both sides will cease fighting, unite the country, and support Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. (Reuters, 4th)

### Australian Prime Minister Urges British Dominions to Assist Motherland in War; Safety of Each State Tied to Britain's Safety; Australia Does Not Favor Southern Countries Ignoring Current Crisis

London – Australian Prime Minister Menzies, in a speech in London yesterday, stated that our objective has always been to be close to Japan. We do not want to make mutual jealousy our goal. We must be adults, not children; realists, not fantasists. As realists, we in Australia have adopted a local self-defense policy aimed at enabling us to resist any attacks from aggressor nations with our own strength. We have no reason to believe that the Pacific cannot live up to its name, as long as the people living on both sides of the Pacific are straightforward, intelligent, patient, and work hard to seek mutual understanding. Regarding Australian-American relations, if we truly believe that Americans are the same as Australians, then we should understand the relationship between America and Australia more deeply. Americans have their own ideals, and these ideals do not necessarily coincide with those of Australians. Americans also have their own interests, and these interests do not necessarily coincide with those of Australians. Australian foreign policy is never dictated by fear. The fact that Australia has dispatched diplomatic representatives to other countries does not indicate any trend toward separation within the British Empire. Anyone who holds this view is greatly mistaken. Now that Japan has reached a compromise with the Axis powers, Australia should not blindly place itself in an atmosphere that is at least questionable and, in fact, dangerous toward Japan. We must not be enveloped by the darkness of this kind of mist, nor can we be sacrificed by the most dangerous habit, which is the deep belief that war is unavoidable. Apart from the events that have already occurred in Europe due to the failure to drive out thieves, I do not believe that there are extremely straightforward international relations in the world that cannot avoid conflict or resolve difficulties. We are adults, and adults do not engage in childish brawls. If opinions differ, they can be voiced. For this reason, we have established direct and full diplomatic authority in Tokyo, but this only adds a strong line to the British organization. Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians, or South Africans have never had any doubt about the crucial point that their own safety is tied to the safety of Britain. Today, the deployment of troops from French territories to assist in the war is no accident. Those in the dominions with even a little knowledge know that if the center of the British Empire is struck, then other parts will be greatly affected. The people of the British Empire everywhere now understand that if all parts are united, then Britain will certainly not fail. (Reuters, 4th)

### Roosevelt Signs Order Freezing Bulgarian Funds in the US

Washington – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently stated that the US government will issue a new "asset freeze" order today. While Morgenthau declined to comment specifically on the scope of this order, he hinted that it may apply to all countries. (Reuters, 4th)

Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday signed an order freezing Bulgarian deposits in the United States. This action was proposed by Secretary of State Hull to the Treasury Department. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's freezing of Bulgarian deposits will not have a major impact on the financial world. President Roosevelt signed this order just two days after German troops entered Bulgaria. According to recent surveys, Bulgarian investment in the United States is less than $10 million, while American investment in Bulgaria is less than $10 million. Since the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium last spring, this order freezing Bulgarian deposits is the eleventh such freezing order. It is said that the Treasury Department has prepared an executive order freezing Italian and German deposits, but it is only awaiting the President's signature. However, some people believe that President Roosevelt's order freezing German and Italian deposits may be issued after the Lend-Lease Act is passed. It is estimated that German deposits in the United States amount to $113,000,000, and Italian deposits in the United States amount to $82,000,000, totaling approximately $200 million.

### Overseas Chinese Leaders in the Philippines Hold Meeting to Discuss Methods of Protecting Overseas Chinese

Manila – Japanese sources say that overseas Chinese leaders from all over the Philippines have been summoned to attend a meeting at the Chinese Consulate in Manila this afternoon to discuss ways to protect overseas Chinese in the Philippines in the event of an imminent crisis in the Pacific. At the meeting, the Chinese Consul read out ten measures to protect overseas Chinese and instructions from the Chinese government in Chongqing. The meeting decided to establish a committee to protect overseas Chinese in the Philippines, which will continue to meet tomorrow to discuss other emergency measures. (Reuters, 4th)

### US Army Department Orders Gas Masks

Washington – The US Army Department has ordered gas masks for non-combatants in military administrative areas. The Army Department announced this yesterday, saying that a limited number of gas masks have already been ordered, and five manufacturers will supply some low-priced gas masks. There are currently no plans to expand the convenience of gas mask manufacturing. (Reuters, 4th)

### German Planes Raid Central London, South Wales Targeted; British Planes Bomb French Coast

London – Last night, German planes raided central London, targeting a city on the coast of South Wales. It appeared that one German plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed. German planes dropped a large number of incendiary bombs, and then bombed the fires. Many civilian homes were destroyed, and the number of dead and wounded is likely to be high. Enemy planes also dropped bombs along the northeast coast and southeastern Scotland. Some houses were destroyed, but the damage was not great. The main target of the German planes was the city of Cardiff in South Wales. (Reuters, 4th)

London – On Sunday night, the British Air Force launched a fierce attack on the invasion ports on the French coast. The attack could be clearly seen from the south coast of England, but due to the strong winds in the Channel, the sound of explosions could not be heard. Large fires broke out in Calais and Boulogne, filling the sky with red light. Searchlights shone along 20 miles of the French coast. (Reuters, 4th)

London – A Reuters Air Force correspondent said that it is noteworthy that Germany has changed from indiscriminately bombing London and other major cities to a more planned blockade air raid, with coastal cities as its main target. The German Air Force on the Western Front is now focusing on attacking ships, laying mines, and bombing ports in order to strike the source of supplies from the United States to Britain. To date, Germany has transferred approximately 600 aircraft to the Balkans, but it is believed that the German side has not yet prepared forward bases in Bulgaria. (Reuters, 4th)

### Fierce Fighting on Albanian Front, Italian Counterattacks Fail

London – The Greek radio station in Athens broadcast a message from the Greek intelligence department, stating that the Greek army had twice repelled fierce attacks by the Italian army. The Italian army first bombarded heavily with artillery, and then attacked at sunset, while the Greek army fiercely struck from a height of 5,000 feet, preventing the Italian army from advancing. The Italian army's two attacks after dusk were also repelled, suffering heavy losses. According to the Greek communique broadcast last night, Greek infantry operated in small units, and the artillery was also fierce and successful. The Greek Air Force shot down two enemy planes, and no Greek planes were damaged. (Reuters, 4th)

### British and German Troops Encounter in Coastal Area of Libya, British Troops Continue to Make Progress on East African Front

Berlin – The German news agency reported that British and German patrols had an encounter in the coastal area of Libya. (Reuters, 4th)

London – A Reuters special correspondent with the troops cabled from the Keren front, stating that the city of Keren, located approximately 75 miles from Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea, has a steep terrain and strong defenses. The Italian side has also deployed elite troops to defend it to the death, so it is not easy for the British Empire forces surrounding the city to capture it for the time being. Currently, the artillery of both sides is fiercely attacking each other. The British artillery moves quickly, constantly changing positions, surprising the enemy and bombarding them fiercely. (Reuters, 4th)

Cairo – The British General Headquarters announced this morning that British troops are continuing to advance beyond Mogadishu, the capital of Italian Somaliland. It is said that British troops penetrated deep into Italian territory and occupied the important village of Afgoi, 80 miles northeast of Mogadishu, yesterday. (International News Service, 4th)

London – A Reuters special correspondent cabled from an air force base on the Sudan-Eritrea border, stating that the British victory in Italian Eritrea is due in no small part to the British Air Force's bombers, South African fighter planes, and Rhodesian squadrons. These British troops have been fighting in the sweltering heat for many weeks and have driven the Italian Air Force out of the sky, so British infantry on the front lines now rarely see Italian planes. (Reuters, 4th)

London – According to official announcements, a total of 140,000 Italian soldiers have been captured in the Libyan campaign. (Reuters, 4th)

### The Painful History of the European War (7) – The British and French Allied Forces' Initial Missteps in the War

Regarding the painful history of France's defeat, the records in magazines and newspapers in Europe and America have been surging up like a storm, and have not yet subsided. Among them, the book "The Great Tragedy of France" by the French writer Morlot can be called a masterpiece, and has been translated by this newspaper and published in succession. Now there is one more article left. Due to the crowding of translated manuscripts, it has been delayed until now to be published, so that readers can get a glimpse of the whole picture:

In early October 1939, after the first batch of British troops had just arrived in France, I was invited to serve as a liaison officer at the British Army Headquarters, preparing to maintain contact between the British army and French civilians through various methods such as writing, lecturing, and radio broadcasting as the war progressed.

During the last World War, I also served as a liaison officer in the British army, and I was naturally overjoyed to be able to do it with ease. Wearing my lieutenant's uniform (this was my military rank in 1918), I went to Arras to meet Lord Gort, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army.

At this time, General Gort was stationed at Fort Habarcq near Arras. I was received by two adjutants. One was a Scottish officer, Gordon, who was handsome, wearing a checkered Scottish kilt, and a bright, silver-handled short sword inserted in his striped stockings. The other was the amiable Sir Montagu, a descendant of King William IV of England's informal union. They received me in a small room and offered me a strong beer, the taste of which was unique. They called it "The Terror of Habarcq." After I accepted it, they led me to the Commander-in-Chief.

The simplicity of the Commander-in-Chief's office was truly unprecedented in my life. A card was nailed to the door with four drawing pins, on which was written in a scrawled handwriting "Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters." There was no furniture in the room. Two white wooden benches were placed on top of a wooden board, which was considered the Commander-in-Chief's desk. Lord Gort believed that a commanding general should share the joys and sorrows of his soldiers, so he was so simple and crude. He was naturally active, but during the war, walking was his only pastime. At dawn, he walked on the muddy roads around Arras, his elbows close to his sides, his neck straight, striding forward, a khaki military cap on his head, completely blocking the raindrops, with an adjutant panting and following closely behind him.

Gordon told me that one day the Commander-in-Chief took him to the Claridge Hotel for a military conference with General Gamelin. He was very happy, thinking that he could enjoy a night out in Paris. Unexpectedly, after dinner, Gort said to him, "Now we can go for a walk."

He kept his elbows close to his body, straightened his neck forward, and walked non-stop, circling the Louvre Palace three times, and then ran back to sleep, while Gordon followed behind him dejectedly.

This was the first time I had met Gort. I was very moved by his youthful spirit and vitality. The British Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, had indeed revitalized the British Army Headquarters. Our conversation was very quick and easy. Lord Gort first talked about Hitler's plan.

General Gort said, "Will Hitler go through Belgium? I think he will, because that is the only route for Germany to advance. You must remember General Foch's famous saying: 'In times of war, we must do everything, do what we can do, and use what we can use.' However, the Flanders region is muddy everywhere in winter, and I don't think Hitler will attack at this time. If there is no movement for a few months, I am afraid that our morale will be slack."

I said, "In 1914, we also hid in the trenches all day."

"That was a different situation. We can't generalize. At that time, we were facing a formidable enemy, so naturally we couldn't be lax. Now we are guarding a line in front of Lille and Douai." (As he said this, he suddenly stood up and pointed out the defensive line on the map to me.) "In front of us, there is only a neutral Belgium. Under these circumstances, it is not easy to maintain the fighting spirit of the army! If it drags on like this, we have to find a way to divert their attention."

He also said, "You should tell the British army more about the situation of the French army, and you should also convey the situation of the British army to the French army. We must also give the various units frequent opportunities to meet each other. Your Seventh Army is stationed on the left wing of the British army, and I myself often visit their commander, General Giraud. He is truly a brave general."

General Gort's principle during the war was always to discard useless things completely, so he didn't even have an ashtray.

The next day, I began to inspect the front lines. As General Gort said, there was nothing to be seen in front of the defensive line except for checkpoints and Belgian police. But once the German army invaded Belgium, this area would become a battlefield. The fragility of the defensive line made me shudder.

What was the situation on the Lille front in October 1939? Steel-reinforced concrete bunkers surrounded by barbed wire were scattered around, one or two kilometers apart. Each bunker was manned by British soldiers. Each bunker had a periscope to look out over the battlefield, as well as a machine gun and a Bren light machine gun. In addition, although I heard that there was also a flat-trajectory gun, there was actually only a gun mount, and the gun had not been delivered.

A trench to defend against tanks meandered between them, dug not deep enough, and not yet completed. Further back, a group of British soldiers were busy digging trenches and shelters. But at this time of year, the Flanders region is always ankle-deep in mud, and this kind of work is inevitably futile. They couldn't dig a few feet deep before a stream of water gushed out from the ground. They fancifully used wooden planks and grass mud to block the all-pervasive source of water. The result was naturally disappointing.

One reporter asked, "Is this our defensive line? God only knows! The attacking forces now are ten times more powerful than in 1914, but our defensive works are ten times weaker than in 1914!"

Many news reporters' faithful reports were detained by the strict censorship office. They had no choice but to suppress their anxiety and perfunctorily deal with the public. But the officers who guarded this defensive line tried their best to appear not pessimistic. One officer pointed out a trench that his subordinates had painstakingly dug to me, and said in a self-deprecating tone, "This trench obviously can't stop a tank. But there is still a forest in front, and we can only hope that the enemy's tanks won't come this way!"

However, in the following weeks, British and French military experts began to extensively construct defensive works. Behind the defensive line, countless workers worked hard to build new steel-reinforced concrete fortifications. Steel skeletons were visible everywhere on the battlefield, forming the outline of new bunkers. Nearby, there were also cement experts sent by the British, mixing mud, sand, and gravel into concrete. In the French defense zone, the camouflage of the new bunkers was very clever, looking like ordinary houses, which the General Headquarters was very satisfied with.

At this time, many people in the French army were reading General Chauvineau's book "Is Aggression Still Possible?" This general was a professor at the Army University, and he came to the conclusion that steel-reinforced concrete bunkers had made aggression absolutely impossible. Such works can be built quickly. Even when the enemy occupies the first defensive line, the defenders can already build the second defensive line. Unfortunately, he completely ignored two facts: first, there may be new ways to attack steel-reinforced concrete fortresses; second, once the enemy breaks through one point, they can copy to the back of the steel-reinforced concrete defensive line. In fact, the British and French armies braved the cold rain and snow and worked hard throughout the long winter to build this defensive line, which was never subjected to a frontal attack by the enemy.

Not only that, most military experts mistakenly believed that the German army would not attack Belgium. Today's Belgian army is strong and well-equipped, so why should Germany drive fish into the deep sea and add a strong enemy? They also firmly believed that the Maginot Line was as solid as a rock, so Hitler only had two routes to advance: one from the Netherlands, and one from Romania. But Rotterdam in the Netherlands is Germany's last respiratory organ, and Romania had already transported her remaining gasoline to Germany, so both of these routes were impassable. Their conclusions were that Germany would not take any action this summer. Time was on our side. By 1941, we could gain air superiority, and by 1942, we could have many tanks and heavy artillery enough to destroy Germany's Siegfried Line. This kind of view was everywhere at that time, and it was used as a topic of conversation at every front-line dinner party. I myself also had this illusion.

### Relief for Teachers and Staff of Shanghai Schools – Principles of Universality and Fairness – Statements Released by Education Authorities –

Allocation Standards Not Yet Officially Ordered, Various External Rumors are Untrue

(Dahua News Agency) Since the Shanghai education community requested higher salaries and government relief due to the ever-increasing cost of living, relevant authorities, recognizing the admirable spirit of educators persevering on this isolated island despite meager incomes and difficult living conditions, immediately submitted a request to the Ministry of Education, which was then forwarded to the Executive Yuan. The Yuan approved the allocation of relief funds. The news was met with jubilation. However, specific measures have not yet been officially ordered, and the outside world, unaware of the truth, has made many conjectures and even spread various rumors, causing widespread discussion. To clarify the truth, a reporter from Dahua News Agency inquired with relevant authorities. The responsible official released the following statement:

Various External Rumors are Groundless

Regarding the central government's relief for teachers and staff in Shanghai, it is indeed true that a request has been submitted to the Ministry of Education and forwarded to the Executive Yuan, which has approved it and instructed the Ministry of Education to handle it. This is a completely accurate fact. However, as of now, no specific measures have been officially ordered. Various external rumors should not be easily believed. Before receiving the Ministry's order, no one dares to say that a decision has been made. From this, it can be inferred that the so-called allocation by the Ministry is without any legitimate basis.

Only Received Ministry Order to Report Numbers

On the Shanghai education administration side, regarding the allocation of relief funds, we have only received an order from the Ministry of Education to investigate and report the number and class levels of teachers and staff who should be given relief. There are no other instructions whatsoever. The number of teachers and staff to be reported has been compiled based on the survey forms reported by various schools and telegraphed for approval. It includes all teachers and staff of public middle schools and private registered primary and secondary schools, indicating that the administrative side's allocation of this relief fund is entirely based on the principle of universal relief. How the Ministry of Education will review and approve it, no one can predict before receiving an official order. This common sense is expected to be understood by the general public.

Public Schools to Seek Other Sources of Funding

It is true that public schools are financially strapped and teachers and staff are poorly paid. The government will naturally try to remedy the situation to the best of its ability. However, since the allocation of relief funds should be based on the principle of universality, it cannot be resolved within the same measures, but should seek other sources of funding. Therefore, the Shanghai administrative side's opinion is that the case of increasing subsidies for public schools should be handled separately as a special case.

Brainstorming, Forming a Committee to Preside

In summary, the Shanghai education authorities are entirely taking into account the overall situation and working together with colleagues in the education community. They have decided to respect the opinions of educators themselves and will invite other party and government agencies and relevant organizations to form a special committee to preside over the allocation, in order to implement their original intentions. It is hoped that all teachers and staff in the city will not easily believe rumors, so as to avoid being ridiculed for creating unnecessary disturbances. Once the Ministry of Education's official order is decided and the funds are allocated, it will be announced to the public as soon as possible and distributed as quickly as possible.

### Memorial Service Held for the Late Musician Xiao Youmei – Teaching Tirelessly for Thirty Years – Memorial Service Scheduled for the 8th of This Month

The death of Xiao Youmei, the principal of the National Conservatory of Music, is a great loss to Chinese musicians. In his early years, Xiao was appreciated by the Founding Father and joined the Tongmenghui. For 30 years, he taught music tirelessly. When the war broke out, the National Conservatory of Music was destroyed by artillery fire. He was ordered by the Ministry of Education to continue his work in Shanghai. Although the surroundings were difficult, Xiao continued to struggle. Recently, he fell ill due to worry and overwork, and eventually passed away. His circumstances after his death were bleak, and there was almost nothing to pay for his funeral. In addition to the school's teachers and students requesting preferential treatment from the central government and the Ministry of Education, it has been heard that Xiao's funeral committee has scheduled a memorial service for 2 pm on the 8th of this month at the American Church at 53 Avenue Petain in the French Concession. Famous musicians at sea, Zhao Meibo, Zakharoff, Shushlin, Shertzoff, and Livshitz, have been specially invited to perform Xiao's posthumous works. People from all walks of life are welcome to attend.

### Food: 1,020,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai in the Past Two Months; Roughly Enough to Feed the Entire City for Four Months; The Crime of Hoarding and Speculation by Profiteers is Clearly Outrageous

The source of foreign rice is related to the city's food supply, so this newspaper pays special attention to it. Special reporters are dispatched to the Valley Shipping Company every day to investigate and disclose information at any time, which is presumably seen by people in the community. It was found that a total of 539,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in January this year, which has been recorded in previous reports. A total of 479,798 bags of foreign rice arrived in February, including 24,000 bags directly from Fangfang, 122,889 bags from Saigon, 20,969 bags from Siam, and 121,000 bags from Rangoon. The remaining 189,940 bags were from Hong Kong. Foreign rice imports in February were 59,468 bags less than in January. The total for the two months was 1,019,064 bags. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yau Sang, arrived from Hong Kong with 4,404 bags of broken rice. The ship berthed at Roosevelt Wharf at 3:00 PM and began unloading today. The foreign rice on board is the first batch for March. (Zu)

### Premium of 1,000 Yuan: 100 Tons of Small Ground Rice Traded; To Date, Only Hoarding and Intensified Price Increases of Foreign Rice Seen

The price manipulation of foreign rice was even more unscrupulous yesterday. Sakura Company's original packaged small ground rice spot goods were limited to 92 yuan, but yesterday a premium of 1,000 yuan was added to trade 100 tons, that is, a premium of 10 yuan per bag, for 102 yuan. Other existing foreign rice with premiums of 5, 6, 6, 7, and 8 yuan have become secretly public. The so-called limited price has been completely destroyed by these profiteers, and the authorities turn a blind eye. However, in addition to the 800,000 bags of foreign rice in the godowns, there are also many private secret hoards and savings of newly arrived rice. Therefore, the public investigation and order to sell should not be delayed any longer. New transactions were made for 1,000 tons of broken rice in March and April, at a price of 96 yuan. He Yi threw it out, and Jian Yuan asked for 97 yuan, and was in the process of telephoning. There were also many other transactions in progress, but importers also took advantage of this chaotic situation to claim that water transportation costs had increased and shouted up their prices. This lifting and pulling will surely lead to people having no food to eat.

Rice in the market has been pulled out by hoarders and is no longer available. It is the same as the dead market. Only Hong Kong glutinous rice is being sold slightly, but the price continues to soar by 2-3 yuan, starting from 95 yuan to 93 yuan. Only thick and thin japonica rice and domestic rice are available. However, because ordinary shops feel that foreign rice is difficult to purchase, they have all switched to domestic rice, resulting in a sudden boom in sales. With few sources of supply and hoarders speculating, the market suddenly soared, rising by a huge 3-4 yuan. Chang Bang’s white japonica rice opened at 115 yuan per dan, Kunshan’s japonica rice at 112-113 yuan, and Qingjiao’s thin japonica rice saw a special price from 109.5 yuan to 107.5 yuan per dan.

### Flour Hoarding Even More Severe; Foreign Flour and Wheat Both Arriving

Flour: Yesterday's trading was quite active. Although new foreign wheat has arrived at the Chinese factories selling flour at a flat price, they have not yet supplied flour. At this time, there are many rumors, and overseas sources are feared to be interrupted at any time. Everyone wants things to be good, and customers who hoard rice have come to hoard flour. The market is full of buying interest, and sellers are simply pushing up prices. It is said that the opening price of Australian flour from the Flower Bird Clock Tower was 28 yuan, and it immediately rose to 10 and 50 cents. Golden Dragon Spleen Flour also rose from 27 yuan to 27.3 yuan. However, in the afternoon market, it was rumored that the Philippine Gies had brought 60,000 bags of American flour and 10,000 bags of foreign wheat, which had arrived in port, and people's hearts softened slightly. The Flower Bird brand returned to 28.1 yuan, and the Ming Long brand returned to 27.1 yuan. After the market price, it was rumored that the newly arrived foreign flour had been sold out, so the market trend once again became firm. In the end, in the face of the changing situation, food is a necessity of life, so ordinary floating capital hoarders are paying attention to purchasing food and daily necessities, resulting in this kind of environment, which is really worrying for the future of people's food.

Wheat: Yesterday's market was still firm. The source of domestic Dumai wheat can be said to be completely exhausted. Although foreign wheat has been transported, the new arrival of 20,000 bags is still not enough to supply the flour mills. It is said that the price of wheat stored in warehouses in the concession has been rising frequently, reaching a call price of 45 yuan. The daily factory gate collection price is also being secretly released, but there is no goods to collect, so the market is becoming more and more secretly firm.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Floating Households Emerge; Rise in Soybean Oil Slightly Reduced

The market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes yesterday was still crazy in the early morning. The market price seemed to rise endlessly, but after that, the positive atmosphere dissipated, and the general profit-taking floating nationals emerged, causing the price rise to be slightly reduced, like a ball being kicked out. It is estimated that the current oil market has stabilized. The oil that rose by 1 yuan first, and then hung up half a yuan. Yellow beans are guarding the original plate from the previous day, corn rose first and fell later, and bean cakes rose slightly by 10 cents. The overall situation is because the bulls are strong and difficult to shake for the time being. However, it is not surprising that there may be small fluctuations in the short term.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Softens in Both Official and Black Markets; Speculation is Uncertain

Foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate was announced at 9:00 AM, and all of them were reduced. The British flag was changed to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence, and the US exchange rate was 5.375 yuan. Other exchange rates such as the Dutch guilder and the Japanese yen were uniformly reduced by varying amounts. As for the situation in the domestic market, the wind once rippled. The current US exchange rate was once quoted at 5.46875 yuan, but near noon, due to negative rumors, the situation turned stable. The after-market also initially showed signs of loosening, but later, due to the Hong Kong power company entering the market, speculators changed from plugging to pulling, causing the trend to recover. Due to tense relations between Britain and Germany, and various other news, people's hearts were unsettled. The result of the evening close was a current US exchange rate of 5.5 yuan, and a British exchange rate of 3 shillings and 3.75 pence, each softening by 0.03125 compared to yesterday.

The British gold price was 3 shillings and 4.0625 pence, and the US exchange rate was 5.53125 yuan, which was the same as the closing price of the previous day. After the opening, the foreign exchange industry had only inflows and no outflows, so the market had already softened. It is estimated that Chinese banks sold spot shillings to foreign exchange companies at 3 shillings and 3.90625 pence. Soon after, the Japanese bank first traded spot US exchange rates, which also tightened to 5.5 yuan. At 9:30, the HSBC exchange rate was announced, and all exchange rates were reduced. The British exchange rate was changed to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence, and the US exchange rate was 5.375 yuan, which fell by 0.0625 and 0.125 respectively. After this, speculation and Hong Kong power purchases were quite strong. The current US exchange rate was once quoted at 5.46875 yuan. When the Sass Bank made some supplies, the potential trend slightly shifted. It is estimated that the Chinese bank's selling price for the March US exchange rate was 5.5 yuan. Later, it was learned that speculators were still paying, so the foreign exchange companies sold the March US exchange rate to speculators again at 5.4375 yuan. By noon, there were sudden negative rumors, and the buying momentum subsided slightly. The spot US exchange rate was 5.5 yuan, and the shilling was 3 shillings and 3.90625 pence.

Hong Kong Electric's Purchasing Appetite is Huge

In the after-market, speculators sold first, and a certain American bank ate up the volume. Therefore, the March US exchange rate was first opened at 5.53125 yuan. Later, Hong Kong Electric entered the market with a huge amount, and foreign exchange companies supplied quickly, so the market was more cheerful. The March rate reached 5.46875 yuan, and speculators could not keep up with the trend. The evening close resulted in a spot US exchange rate of 5.5 yuan, and the March rate was 5.46875 yuan. The spot and current shilling rates were both 3 shillings and 3.75 pence, which was 0.03125 yuan tighter than the closing price of the US exchange rate on the previous day, and the British exchange rate was also 0.03125 tighter.

(The telegraph code may have errors and needs to be verified)

The market opened flat at 2:30 PM, and the Shanghai spot exchange rate fell by 1 yuan to 444 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.

### Amidst Rumors, the Gold Market Rose and Fell Uncertainly

Yesterday's gold market in the Shanghai black market fluctuated greatly, rising sharply and then falling, and finally returning to an upward trend. Speculators believed that the important key of 5.5 yuan for the US exchange rate had been broken, but under negative news, the upward momentum of all directions was repeatedly suppressed. Initially, continuing the upward trend of the previous day, foreign exchange was reported to be tight, and securities companies, bank silver companies, and gold companies pushed hard, and it was once seen at 6,390 yuan. However, the good times did not last long. At around 11:40, the situation suddenly changed. It was rumored that the United States had expanded the freezing of funds worldwide, and foreign exchange loosened amidst the chaos. Moreover, Xin Yuan came out, resulting in news that a bull company in Shanghai West was selling. Those who followed the trend gathered, and there was a 200 yuan decline, retreating to a low price of 6,190 yuan. At noon, the gold companies absorbed and raised the price, and in the afternoon it rose again to over 6,300 yuan. The relationship between the United States and Germany deteriorated, and the United States will recall its ambassador to Germany, and Germany also plans to withdraw overseas Chinese businessmen in the United States.

Cash was issued by Cheng Ji, Chu Xing, and Yong Yi for 100 taels, and the price was 510 yuan higher than the forward price. Yong Feng issued 200 taels to Xiang He, 520 yuan higher.

200 Yuan Fell from the Sky

At the opening, only buying was heard on the table, raising the price to 6,360 yuan, more than 60 yuan better than the previous day. After the opening, under Xiang He's strong purchase, it rose another 10 yuan to 6,370 yuan. However, Tong Kang Yong, Cheng Ji, and Heng Ji and others sold and filled, and the rising momentum was blocked, and was first suppressed to 6,315 yuan. However, the domestic and foreign exchange rates were reported to be tight, and the buyer's confidence was extraordinarily brave, such as De Fu, Gong He, Cheng Ji, Heng Ji, Fu Shi buying trend, straight up to 6,390 yuan. But at this time, a negative rumor suddenly arose in the market, and the public was slightly moved and tended to sell, and the falling trend was also fast, even breaking through the 300 and 200 yuan marks, retreating to 6,190 yuan. Afterwards, it began to hover, relying on Cheng Ji, Xiang He, Da Feng and other households to absorb, and promoted to 6,260 yuan to close. The opening in the afternoon was quite expensive, at 6,290 yuan, but retail investors came to spit, reaching a small 6,260 yuan, and finally Cheng Da, Da Feng, etc. entered the market one after another, and the trend went upward. Tian Yuan once acted as an agent for Xie Tai Yong to enter 110 taels, for a high price of 6,308 yuan. Later, Heng Ji. Tong Kang Yong and others sought to sell, and slowly dropped to 6,245 yuan. The exchange market was still reported to be tight at the time, and De Fu and Cheng Ji Xin Yuan and others were dredging, and soared to 6,292 yuan.

### Wonderful Ways to Protect Wealth

— Saint Ke Qiong

As early as last year, when the author was writing financial commentary for this newspaper, in view of the seriousness of the situation in the Far East and the imprudence of speculation in the foreign exchange market, I advised general asset owners to promptly transfer their funds inland and encouraged the purchase of gold public debt. At that time, although the author spoke earnestly, asset owners listened with contempt. The fact is more eloquent than words. The situation in the South Pacific is becoming more tense day by day, and the possibility of a US-Japanese war breaking out at any time is high. The Shanghai Concession is also likely to be occupied by Japan at any time. General asset owners are finally alarmed by the smell of gunpowder, and begin to panic about the safety of temporarily sheltering in the Concession. They don't know what the only wonderful way to dispose of funds to protect wealth is - storing foreign exchange? Collecting gold? Hoarding goods? But foreign exchange has the risk of being frozen, the spot gold chips are too few, and the goods may be confiscated.

Funds are of course flowing to safe areas. But funds flowing to safe areas are not absolutely safe, permanently safe, only relatively safe, temporarily harmless. The absolute safety of funds is based on the foundation of national power being able to protect them. There has never been funds that are safe and harmless when separated from the protection of national power. Although funds are stored in safe areas, this is both a theory and a fact: the anxious state of general fund owners in Shanghai today is a reflection of this theory.

Shanghai is not really an absolutely safe zone for storing funds, but relying on the Chinese government's financial strength and the friendly relations between Britain and the United States and the Chinese government, funds have been relatively safe here for a long time. But the current relative safety may turn into absolute danger at any time. As long as the war in the South Pacific does not break out in a day, it is not dangerous because of the existence of China's financial strength and the friendly relations between Britain and the United States. However, no one can guarantee that the war in the South Pacific will not happen tomorrow, then no one can guarantee that it is not dangerous not to make arrangements for the funds in Shanghai in advance. In fact, once the war in the South Pacific breaks out, Japan will definitely seize the Concession, China's financial strength will also withdraw, and the friendly relations between Britain and the United States and China will also withdraw. The factors on which funds currently rely on for relative safety will no longer exist.

So, what is the only wonderful way to dispose of funds to protect wealth?

Although the Chinese government has not announced any wonderful ways to protect funds in the face of the current emergency, it has already opened up several major avenues for investing funds in the past. Unfortunately, these methods have not only been forgotten by general fund owners, but probably have never even been recognized. The author will introduce these several situations of investing funds as follows: (To be continued)

### Securities: Debt Market Difficult to Rise or Fall

The black market for public debt yesterday still did not break free from the hovering state. It was slightly smaller in the morning and slightly better again in the afternoon. It is difficult to rise and even more difficult to fall. It seems that this repeated brewing is due to the fact that the shorts are too crowded. In the future, because the short barrier is built higher and higher, I am afraid that it will be difficult to avoid repeating the cover of last year's rising tide, but it is only a matter of time. Yesterday's transaction, Xinfu is still buying non-stop, the period has been almost ten days, more absorption on every dip, never raising the price, the strength of the force can be imagined how the role, is unknown, and the future changes, that is in it. The rest, such as Shunchang Lianhe Dingkang, etc., are also mostly buying, but Tongkang has always sold, for many days, and the rest are suddenly entering and suddenly exiting, without any consistent role, which is not lacking, most of them are waiting for an opportunity to observe changes, waiting for the time to move only, yesterday's market results, only Grade A slightly better a dime, Grade D is unique because it is compared with the 26th of last month, less than eight dimes, Grade C and E are about a dime less, Grade B does not move, the total number of transactions is one hundred and forty-fifty thousand. A brief table is listed below.

The stock transaction成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股一百股, the price is 19 yuan.

The stock market of the public utilities is still very dull, the price is trending downward, the transaction is sparse, and speculators and investors are unwilling to be active at this time, and rubber stocks are also soft in a dull way.

### Dividend for Water Company Stock

The British Shanghai Water Company will hold its annual shareholders' meeting on March 27, and at the same time pay dividends for 1940, the 7% cumulative preference shares and 6.5% cumulative preference shares will each pay a next dividend of 3.5% and 3.25%, the last dividend for common shares, A pays 6.5% (including 4% of supplementary interest for 1939), equivalent to 26 shillings of British gold, plus an interim interest of 1%, for a total dividend of 7.5% for the whole year, for a total of 30 shillings of British gold, and also pays 1 shilling and 2 pence under the heading of off-boundary water supply and ship water supply, for a total payment of 31 shillings and 2 pence for the whole year, B pays 4.5%, equivalent to 10.8 pence of British gold (also including 2% of supplementary interest for 1939), plus an interim dividend of 5.5%, equivalent to 1 shilling and 2 pence of British gold, and also pays a dividend of 0.7 pence per share under the heading of off-boundary water supply and ship water supply, for a total payment of 1 shilling and 1.9 pence, C pays 5.5%, equivalent to 1 shilling and 1.2 pence of British gold, plus an interim of 6.5%, equivalent to 1 shilling and 3.6 pence of British gold.

### Cotton Yarn: The Yarn Market Frustrated by Rumors, Difficult to Grasp Whether Long or Short

The yarn market is fluctuating and unpredictable, with rumors flying everywhere, causing speculators to become disoriented. As a result, the market rises and falls suddenly, making it very difficult to grasp. Judging from the current state, the future of the yarn market is still uncertain. Because those who are bullish have sufficient inventory, if they are bearish, the margin increases, and the foreign exchange shrinks, speculative buyers will immediately come. Everyone is currently in a bullish position, hoping for the greatest gains. A surge upward, but prices have risen by dozens of yuan for two or three consecutive days. Many who are profiting are taking their profits and leaving the market. Once the chips are loosened, the reaction and fall are also rapid. Therefore, the current yarn market is like ants on a hot pot. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 1,424 yuan, and the low price is 1,386 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,391 yuan, gradually rising to 1,401 yuan.

When the Double Horse market opened in the morning, the bulls all came out in force, raising prices for each other, rising directly from 1,406 yuan to 1,424 yuan. Some who had made profits sold off, returning to 1,411 yuan. However, new buyers were numerous, and prices were seen to rise again. Unexpectedly, shortly before 11:45 AM, it was heard that there was another freeze on foreign exchange, and the margin fell. In an instant, the yarn market experienced a sudden downturn, and there were shouts of "sell" in the market. For a time, only selling was heard, with no transactions taking place, plunging straight to 1,386 yuan at closing. It is found that 6,700 bales were traded in half a day. The amount bought by each guild is listed as follows:

Hong Kong: 895 Ningbo: 5

Counterparts: 5,800 Total: 6,700

### Cotton Market Remains Cool

The current cotton situation is slightly firmer, but actual consumption needs to develop. Therefore, the cotton market is still on a path of hesitation.

In the New York cotton market, traders are all taking a wait-and-see approach, so the market is flat and unremarkable. The result was a drop of two or three pounds compared to the closing price of the previous day.

In the Indian cotton market, prices rose first due to short covering, followed by speculative selling and a fall in cotton merchants' hedge selling. As a result, yesterday, including forecasts, prices rose slightly by more than one rupee.

Transactions of imported cotton in Shanghai are cold and no one cares about them. Market prices have also slightly softened. If the current environment cannot be improved, the future of the cotton market is of great concern.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Factory Prices Rise in the Morning, Fall in the Afternoon

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was uncertain, rising and falling suddenly, because traders' speculative minds were strong. They bought when prices rose and sold when prices fell. The market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, resulting in a flat outcome. The morning price of Fugui Dapeng fine cloth rose by 5 jiao per bolt, and fell back by 5 jiao in the afternoon. The morning price of Ewo coarse cloth rose by about 2.5 jiao, and also returned to the original price of the previous day in the afternoon. Bleached and dyed cloth remained unchanged. Small amounts of hand goods were resold at slightly lower prices. More than 400 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The Ningbo guild handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, etc. The Fujian guild handled 50 to 60 pieces of money cloth, kersey, and blue cloth, etc. The Guangdong and Hong Kong guilds handled more than 100 pieces of shirting, poplin, colored twill, and pongee, etc. Also, 300 pieces of cotton cloth are being shipped to Qingdao today (5th).

Dong Cloth: Initially flat, then rising, and then falling back at closing. The result was stable, without major fluctuations. 11-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 48.6 yuan. The current month for spot goods remains expensive, closing at 49.4 yuan. The morning price of Four Gentlemen kersey reached a high of 1.34 yuan, and the market fell back to 1.3275 yuan.

### Spring Wool Gabardine is the Most Popular

Spring thin wool gabardine is very popular, and prices are rising daily. The inventory of imported goods from the East and West is extremely scarce. The genuine spring thin wool gabardine from this factory is also produced in small quantities. Yesterday, the wholesale price of the top-grade spring thin wool gabardine made in England was 70 yuan per yard, and the price of ordinary grades was around 60 yuan. The Italian-made 42,000-grade was 30 yuan. The top-grade Japanese goods were 43 or 44 yuan, the second-grade were 30 yuan, and the ordinary grades from this factory were all sold at 22 or 23 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend upward due to the relatively large number of importers. The guild set the price for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar at 81 yuan at the local warehouse. Prices at outside warehouses fluctuated, initially from 80.6 yuan to 80.8 yuan, then falling back to 80.6 yuan to 80.5 yuan, resulting in a rise of 6 jiao. The price for March 10 contracts was 80.09 yuan to 80.8 yuan, and the price for March 20 contracts was 81.2 yuan to 81 yuan, rising 7 jiao. Taikoo Granulated White B Mark at the Western warehouse was 82.5 yuan to 83 yuan, then falling back to 82.6 yuan, an increase of 1.6 yuan. DY Mark at the Eastern warehouse was 79.5 yuan, rising 5 jiao. HX Mark at the Western warehouse was 79.2 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Items: Soap Prices Continue to Rise

The supply of soap is scarce and demand is high, and buying prices have risen again. Currently, Guben soap is selling for 37 yuan per case, with a small amount available on the market. Baixiangmao soap is 23 yuan per case, Huangxiangmao soap is 27 yuan per case, and Scissors soap is 28 yuan per case, all of which are higher than last week.

### Coal: Tongdeli White Coal - A Good Rise of More Than Ten Yuan -

Tongdeli white coal, because there were too many old warehouse orders a month ago, the hoarding was congested, and it had fallen to 232 or 233 yuan, with no one accepting it. In recent days, due to the tense situation in Vietnam, there are rumors of more favorable news in the market, and the dark market and the open market have been competing, with a good rise of more than ten yuan. The company's listed price is still 245 yuan, and warehouse orders are also limited. Therefore, the shops on this street have also increased their prices, delivering screened lumps to customers for 260 yuan per ton, it is said.

### The Far East Situation is Gradually Becoming Tense: The British Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Gracefully: He Did Not Readily Reply to Various Questions, But Denied the Conclusion of a Military Alliance Between China and Britain: Accompanying Him Were the Ambassador's Wife and Attending Secretary

Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, left Shanghai for Chongqing in September last year. In Chongqing, he met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for close talks. The Ambassador's wife left Shanghai for Hong Kong a few weeks ago to welcome her husband. The Ambassador left Chongqing by plane on the 25th of last month and stayed in Hong Kong for three days, taking the Ewo Company's Yuesheng round to Shanghai. The ship arrived in port at 3:30 PM yesterday and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. At that time, dozens of French Concession police officers and plainclothes detectives were densely deployed around the wharf, and the security was very tight. George, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, and representatives from various British institutions in Shanghai went to welcome him.

The Ambassador and His Wife Retained Their Former Demeanor

The Ambassador wore a blue-gray coat, a brown woolen overcoat, and yellow leather shoes. His complexion was ruddy and he was full of energy. He smoked a pipe, carried a white leather briefcase, and his attitude was calm and dignified. He shook hands and greeted Consul-General George and others one by one. Mrs. Kerr wore a white fox fur coat, a yellow dress, and a scarf that was also yellow. The silver-white hair was even more noticeable. At 3:45 PM, the Ambassador and his wife, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. George, took a special diplomatic car No. 16 and car No. 4426 and went straight to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. Secretary Mackenzle also followed in another car.

Absolutely Denied the Sino-British Alliance

When Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and his wife stepped onto the wharf from the Yuesheng round, there were many reporters, especially Japanese reporters, who took photos of them and asked various questions. However, the Ambassador did not respond and refused to express his general views on the situation in China's wartime capital. However, when a reporter asked about the rumored plan for a military alliance between China and Britain, the British Ambassador said, "This is nonsense," and said that he enjoyed the journey very much.

His Stay in Shanghai Will Be Very Short

According to Mr. I. C. Mackenzle, the Ambassador's private secretary, only the Ambassador's wife and himself accompanied the Ambassador to Shanghai. Except for a short rest in Hong Kong, there were no delays on the way. The Ambassador's purpose in coming to Shanghai was to handle matters here and there were no other tasks. The Ambassador will have a short stay in Shanghai, which may be one month, but it has not been decided yet as he has just arrived. The Ambassador usually stays in Chongqing for half a year and in Shanghai for half a year. The Ambassador left Shanghai for Chongqing in August last year, which is almost half a year ago, so he came to Shanghai and went straight there to rest. However, it is heard that he has now decided to move to the Cathay Hotel.

Handle General Necessary Affairs

Many believe that the Ambassador's arrival is due to the increasingly urgent southward advance of Japan, and the United Kingdom must take appropriate measures. Secondly, British expatriates in the Far East are gradually evacuating, and there must be good steps. Thirdly, today, the upper

Photos of the British Ambassador Kerr and his wife arriving in Shanghai

When reporters asked whether the rumors spread by the Japanese that the Ambassador would go to Manila were reliable, it was said that nothing was known yet. According to reports, the Ambassador was originally scheduled to leave Chongqing for Shanghai in early February, but it was rumored that his departure was delayed because the secret documents of Japanese Navy Admiral Koshirō Oikawa's southward advance were obtained by the Chinese army. The current situation in Shanghai, the sea situation, is of concern to the United Kingdom and the United States, which have the greatest interests. Mr. Kerr said that in order to understand the current situation in Shanghai, it is extremely necessary to come here from Chongqing. Although Mr. Kerr will not publicly express any opinions during his stay in Shanghai due to environmental constraints, diplomatic activities will inevitably be tense. In addition to instructing his subordinates with government diplomatic secrets to respond to contingencies, Mr. Kerr will also listen to reports from relevant officials to serve as a reference for the United Kingdom's decision-making policy.

### Women's Circles Prepare to Celebrate the March 8th International Women's Day

March 8th is International Women's Day, the starting point for women in various countries around the world to fight for freedom, liberation, and equality. Women's groups in this city, such as the City Women's Association, Women's Association, Women's Temperance Union, Women's Mutual Aid Society, and China Women's Society, originally planned to convene women from all over the city to hold a grand celebration meeting. However, due to the special environment and the authorities' prohibition of gatherings, it was decided to suspend the formal expression. In addition to jointly publishing a letter to women in the city on this day, encouraging them to take on the national responsibility of saving the country and seeking survival, aiming for the ultimate victory, in the face of the era and the current responsibilities, and the meaning of "every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country."

### Japanese Warships in Eastern Zhejiang Have a Southward Appearance: Japanese Planes Bomb Haimen and Yongjia: Japanese Warships Fire Two Shells with Heavy Guns

The details of the bombing of Haimen and Yongjia by more than 20 Japanese planes in Eastern Zhejiang the day before yesterday are unknown. According to information from the shipping industry in this port yesterday, a Japanese warship passing through Chuanshanyang sailed north to ×× place at 2:27 PM on the 2nd, firing heavy artillery at the shore, but only fired two shells, which fell into the mud and caused no losses. The warship then sailed north. Also, Ningbo issued a total of four air raid alerts over three days, and 16 Japanese planes passed through the area. According to news from the shipping industry, most of the Japanese warships in the Zhejiang Sea recently have been preparing to sail south, so their actions are frequent. Yesterday alone, a total of 13 Japanese warships of various sizes, including many transport ships, arrived at sea from Zhenhai in the west to Chuanshan and Xiangshan in the east. First, one Japanese warship arrived, followed by seven, and then four more. The batch of Japanese warships all sailed away one after another in the afternoon and were still moored on a certain island in Zhoushan to replenish supplies and had a southward appearance.

### The Rice Market Has No Restrictions: The Situation is Getting Worse: Not Only Exceeding the Limit, But Also Implementing Subsidies: All Parties Should Be Sincere in Suppressing Rice Prices

The rice market has recently been shrouded in rumors again, and rice prices have continued to rise, seemingly determined to put the poor to death. It is found that the import of foreign rice this year is very strong. A total of 539,200 bags arrived in January, which has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that a total of 479,700 bags also arrived in February. The total number of bags arriving in two months is 1,019,000 bags. The first arrival of foreign rice this month was the Yuesheng round of Jardine Matheson yesterday, which brought 4,404 bags from Hong Kong. It is heard that the French company has five ships arriving in Shanghai within ten days, bringing a large batch of foreign rice. Therefore, there should be no problem with the source of foreign rice.

Discussions by All Parties

The Shanghai Times reported that representatives from the Public Concession Board of Directors, the French Concession Municipal Council, and the "Municipal Government," as well as the Japanese authorities, held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon (3rd) to discuss the serious situation in Shanghai caused by food shortages. This meeting was initiated and convened by "Mayor" Chen Gongbo.

The Attitude of the Authorities

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the rice market transactions this morning (4th) not only exceeded the official maximum price set by the Rice Grain Evaluation Committee but also implemented subsidies, making the rice situation in Shanghai even worse. It is heard that the rice market transactions subsidize 1,000 yuan for every 100 bags, so the No. 2 tribute rice exceeds the official maximum price of the No. 1 tribute rice. Mr. Hederqui, Deputy Director-General of the Public Concession Board of Directors, declined to comment on this when he met with reporters this morning. It is said that the Public Concession Board of Directors is only in the position of supervising the Rice Grain Evaluation Committee composed of major rice merchants. There are rumors in the market that the relevant responsible parties have discussed steps to deal with the current crisis, but the alleged meeting between Mr. He and representatives of the committee this morning has not been confirmed. It is heard that the Portuguese round Pluto has recently arrived in Shanghai with more than 10,000 bags of tribute rice, and it is estimated that the current rice stock in this city is more than 1.5 million bags, equivalent to more than 2 million dan.

Rice Shop Notice

The Rice Shop Industry Association issued a notice to its members yesterday, saying that rice prices in this city are soaring and increasing without end. In order to supply the market, fellow traders have to purchase goods to meet the market demand. If we want to keep the limit price, we have no goods to buy. If we want to buy goods, we must endure the pain of exceeding the limit. Not only is the sacrifice too great, but it also violates the authorities' arrangements. If we hesitate and do not enter the market, there will be no goods to supply the market, and the people will be panic-stricken. The people's food and public order are all related. Our fellow traders are in extreme difficulty. In addition to reporting the above situation to the authorities of the two concessions truthfully and seeking remedial measures quickly, we hereby notify you and hope that all fellow traders will check and take the overall situation into consideration. In this tense period, take into account the livelihood of the common people as the most important thing. Whether it is wholesale or retail, we must strictly abide by the limit price and must not exceed it in the slightest. Wait for the authorities' instructions to handle the matter in order to maintain the people's livelihood.

### National Medical Civilian Hospital Asks for Help from Society: A Monthly Shortfall of 4,000 Yuan: Hoping for Donations from All Parties

The National Medical Civilian Hospital's medical services are developing day by day, so the economic aspect cannot offset income and expenditure. At a recent board meeting, it was said that the hospital's funding, in addition to the Zhenwei Association's monthly grant of 2,000 yuan, the remainder was income from outpatient registration fees and hospitalization fees, amounting to 600 to 700 yuan per month, while the amount of expenditure was about 7,000 yuan per month, a monthly shortfall of about 4,000 yuan. And there are 70,000 people treated each year. All the funds have been used up, and the hospital's bedding was originally insufficient, and it has been damaged over time, making it more difficult to maintain. How to add more is also a problem. In addition, three executive directors are missing and should be re-elected, and Director Lu Bolong proposed adding an obstetrics department. After discussions by the board of directors, although there are solutions, it is still hoped that enthusiastic people in society will do their best to support and maintain the hospital so that it will not be ruined and create benefits for poor patients.

### Fangdan Case: Continued Hearing Today

The Consular Court is scheduled to continue the ninth hearing of the case of four Chinese landlords suing the Public Concession Board of Directors for collecting Fangdan property tax at 2:30 PM today in the conference hall on the second floor of the Public Concession Board of Directors. Because the scope involved in the case is very wide, it is not easy for both parties to end the provision of evidence. However, Judge Lang stated last time that he hoped that both parties could end the evidence part in court today, so it is expected that today will be the last investigation court, and the fierce debate between the two parties will also exceed the previous several times. According to a certain landlord yesterday, about 60% of the land in the concession belongs to Tao Deed land, and 40% belongs to Fangdan land. Since foreigners have no land ownership in Chinese territory, those who hold Tao Deed land only have the right to permanent lease of the land and must pay rent and taxes to the Public Concession Board of Directors. However, Fangdan land is different, because those who hold Fangdan land have ownership of the land and pay a certain amount of land tax to the Chinese government. Now, if the Public Concession Board of Directors wants to collect Fangdan land tax, it violates Chinese land laws and regulations.

### The Board of Directors Will Discuss Today: Measures to Reduce Electricity: Based on the Plan Proposed by the Power Company: And Assist in Obtaining Coal Transport Vessels

The Committee on Studying the Problem of Current Supply organized by the Public Concession Board of Directors convened a meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday in the conference room on the second floor of the Public Concession Board of Directors to discuss the plan proposed by the power company to reduce the supply of current and how the Public Concession Board of Directors can assist the power company in obtaining vessels for transporting coal and gasoline so that the power company can have a sufficient supply of electricity. The results of the meeting will have to wait until the Board of Directors meeting at 4:30 PM this afternoon before a decision can be made. If the electricity reduction measures are implemented gradually, it is hoped that the industrial and commercial circles in this city will not encounter major impacts as a result. It is heard that Chinese and Japanese-owned yarn factories have already begun to reduce work by 20% to 50%.

Adequate Supply for Proper Use

According to inquiries with the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the company's coal reserves can now meet the needs for three months. However, if transportation can be facilitated and a large amount of coal can be obtained, there is no need to worry about the shortage of electricity supply. Most of the coal needed by the company comes from North China and Cambodia India. Now, due to transportation difficulties, a plan to reduce the supply of current has to be made, but it is hoped that citizens can save unnecessary electricity consumption so that the current can be fully supplied for proper use. According to inquiries with a certain industrial circle, if the power company lacks coal sources and reduces the supply of current, some factories will be affected as a result. However, some factories that use electric heat can switch to gas, but the cost is more expensive.

Sufficient Oil Reserves in this City for Several Months

According to the Shanghai News, regarding the possibility of a shortage of gasoline in Shanghai, an employee of Mobil Oil Company told reporters yesterday (3rd) that the company does not intend to limit the amount of any type of oil. He admitted that there is currently a shortage of lubricating oil (i.e., diesel) in this port and could not say when new supplies would arrive from overseas. The fear of a possible shortage of gasoline yesterday caused a large number of car dealers and transportation companies in this port to purchase large quantities. However, according to investigations, the gasoline reserves in this port are still sufficient for several months. According to other sources, the so-called possible shortage of gasoline is a rumor spread by speculators, hoping to take the opportunity to raise oil prices in order to achieve their hoarding and profiteering desires. The shortage of lubricating oil has lasted for too long and will indeed cause a blow to the transportation industry in this port, but some quarters believe that new goods will arrive by the end of March.

Industrial Circles Pay Attention to the Amount of Reduction

According to the report of the Industrial and Social Affairs Office of the Public Concession Board of Directors in February, the Shanghai Electric Power Company announced the possibility of reducing the supply of current at the end of last month. Although the details have not been officially announced, this matter has attracted the attention of the industrial circles. According to several factories, if the amount of current supply is not reduced by much, they can still cope with it. If it is reduced by a large amount suddenly, there will be difficulties. Factories such as glass factories, thermos bottle factories, light bulb factories, and copper rolling factories that use diesel oil are expected to experience difficulties due to the lack of oil supply. As for factories that use steam, they are also worried about the shortage of fuel. There are 30 factories that used to be silk factories, but now they have been converted into warehouses, iron factories, textile factories, and dyeing factories due to the lack of profits.

Spot Coal Has Been Manipulated

Because a large amount of coal in Shanghai is being manipulated, the spot chips in the market have suddenly decreased, and people's hearts are firm. Yesterday, the market price of coal was actually driven up. Recently, the Shanghai Electric Power Company intends to reduce the daily electricity supply compared to the past due to a shortage of coal reserves, so some people who are blinded by profit have taken the opportunity to move and control a large amount of hoarding, which is not the right thing to do. Now, the market price of coal balls is 9 yuan per dan (100 city catties), and the lives of the middle and lower classes will become more and more difficult. According to news from the coal industry, the Japanese merchant ship Mitiren Maru transported a large amount of Hongji coal dross to the port at 7:00 AM yesterday. It is learned that the coal dross was ordered by two major coal ball factories for use on the market. It is hoped that it will be sold off as soon as possible to stabilize market prices.

Motor Electricity Has Been Restricted

The Public Concession Board of Directors has recently issued a notice, stating that due to the shortage of fuel and the difficulty of delivery, from now until the date of another notice, the Shanghai Electric Power Company will not accept any requests for connecting motor electricity, whether it is newly installed or expanded. The Bureau has agreed to this.

### Preparedness Will Be Implemented for the Anniversary of the Death of the Premier: The Measures Have Not Yet Been Announced

The 12th of this month is the anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China. The authorities of the two concessions will implement preparedness in various parts of the concessions on that day. As for the specific preparedness measures to be adopted, police officers refused to comment yesterday, but said that terrorists within the concessions have been very active recently, so the authorities may adopt "unexpected measures." At the same time, various Chinese groups have formulated a number of commemorative measures for the anniversary of the death of the Premier, and various institutions, banks, schools, and shops will also fly flags at half-mast on that day. All entertainment venues will suspend entertainment, and the public will silently mourn together.

### Birthday of the Late President of Czechoslovakia Today: Celebrated by Czech Expatriates

Today is the 91st birthday of the late President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk of the Czechoslovak Republic. Czech expatriates in this city are holding commemorations to show their celebration. Masaryk was the leader of Czechoslovakia before World War I and traveled around the world, fighting for the national revival movement. His footprints almost covered Italy, Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Russia, China, Japan, the United States, and other countries. As a result, various countries recognized Czechoslovakia as a member of the Allied Powers. After Germany, Austria, and other countries surrendered, Czechoslovakia became a republic, and Masaryk was elected as the first president. He served for 17 years. At the age of 85, he retired due to fatigue and Edvard Beneš succeeded him. Masaryk died a year before the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia. Masaryk was not only the leader of Czechoslovakia but also one of the great men in the world. Czech expatriates in this city said that he was very similar to Sun Yat-sen, the revolutionary leader of China. The Nazis did not allow Czechs in the German-occupied areas to hold any celebrations or commemorations and did not allow Czech newspapers to mention Masaryk's name.

Each bag of crushed wheat weighs 50 pounds, and 8,000 bags are worth a total of 8,000 US dollars. This is the first batch of Red Cross crushed wheat to arrive here since February 1st. Once it arrives, it will be distributed in Shanghai and the nearby suburbs.

### High Second Branch President Xu Weizhen Abducted Yesterday - Encountered Bandits on the Way Back to Hualong Road Apartment - Wife and Driver Were Forced Out of the Car

Yesterday afternoon at around six o'clock, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred on Hualong Road in the French Concession. The kidnapped person was Xu Weizhen, President of the High Second Branch. The details are as follows:

Dusk After Finishing Official Business - Returning Home by Car

Xu Weizhen, courtesy name Xuying, President of the High Second Branch on Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession, is sixty-two years old, from Tongxiang, Zhejiang. His residence in Shanghai is at No. 52, Yang's Apartment, No. 30 Hualong Road, French Concession. He routinely takes the branch's official car (Concession Permit No. 2262) to the branch office at 9:00 AM and returns home at 5:00 or 6:00 PM. Yesterday afternoon, his wife, Wang, a Suzhou native, fifty-six years old, went to the court for business. After Xu finished his official duties at 6:00 PM, he and his wife Wang took the branch car to return home.

Bandits Waiting in Ambush - Car and People Taken

As the car was about to arrive at the entrance of his residence and was stopping, five bandits dressed in Chinese attire, who had been waiting on the side of the road, suddenly rushed out in front of the car. Three bandits brandished pistols, threatening and intimidating, forbidding anyone to make a sound. The remaining bandits opened the car door and told Wang to get out. After Wang got out of the car, four bandits successively got into the car, held Xu hostage, and poked his waist with a gun barrel. Another bandit drove the chauffeur out of the car. The bandits also got into the car, accelerated, and drove north, turning onto Avenue Joffre and speeding westward.

Chinese and Western Detectives - Arrived at the Scene to Investigate

After his wife watched the car speeding away without a trace, she returned home and telephoned the French Concession police station, which immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene of the incident to investigate. The police station also notified the Public Concession police authorities to assist in the search. At that time, the car the bandits were originally in (Concession Permit No. 2015) was also closely following Xu's car.

Long-Term Legal Career - Highly Reputed

Xu holds a Doctor of Law degree from Indiana University in the United States. During the late Qing Dynasty, he worked for the Ministry of Posts and Communications and later served as a judicial officer at the Naval Department. After the Republic of China was established, he served as a judge of the Supreme Court, a lecturer in law at National Peking University, the Chief of the Higher Court of Shanxi Province, the Secretary-General of the Committee for Investigating Legal Rights, a professor of law at Soochow University, a counselor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, and a counselor of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. He is currently the President of the High Second Branch of Jiangsu and Shanghai. He is known for his impartiality and integrity and enjoys a high reputation. Since this case occurred, people in society have been astonished that Xu, as a judicial officer of the city, was actually abducted. Therefore, everyone is paying close attention.

### U.S. Consul General's Office - Busy Processing Passports

According to news obtained yesterday, the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai receives 400 applications for immigration passports each month. Some are approved, and some are rejected. One of the reasons for the surge in the number of requests for immigration passports is that Shanghai has seen a large influx of refugees from Europe in recent years. It is reported that in addition to issuing immigration passports, the U.S. Consulate also handles the issuance of tourist passports and student passports, as well as passports for travel to the Philippines.

### Two More Russian Ships - Arrived in Shanghai - The "Simairne" is Nearing Completion of Repairs - Scheduled to Depart for Little Luzon with Cargo

After two Soviet ships arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok last month, they are currently undergoing repairs in Shanghai. According to Hongyun Shipping Agency, the agent for Russian ships, two more Soviet ships will arrive in port from Vladivostok in the next day or two. They will also remain in the Wanguo Shipyard dock in Pudong for inspection and repairs. Neither of these cargo ships is carrying passengers or cargo. One of the two ships is named "Sovet," with a deadweight tonnage of 1,385 tons, and the other is named "Maxim Gorky," with a deadweight tonnage of 2,256 tons. For three and a half years, the arrival of Russian ships in Shanghai had been absent. Since the "Simairne" first arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of last month, followed by the "Komiles," and now the "Sovet" and "Maxim Gorky," which are expected to arrive in port today or tomorrow, the number has reached four. The "Simairne," which first arrived in Shanghai, is nearing completion of repairs. This ship has a deadweight tonnage of 2,154 tons and is scheduled to leave Shanghai around the 10th or 11th of this month, loading cargo and heading to Little Luzon. The "Komiles" has a deadweight tonnage of 2,255 tons. The date of its departure and destination after the completion of repairs are yet to be determined. When asked whether the shipyards in Vladivostok were too busy working for the Russian fleet to attend to merchant ships, which were thus opportunistically sailing to Shanghai for repairs, the reporter did not receive detailed information, but it is known that after the repairs are completed, the ships will gradually join the Far East shipping operations, carrying cargo between Shanghai and various ports in Southeast Asia.

### Alcott - Denies Leaving Shanghai

Famous radio reporter Alcott published an article in the Continental Daily yesterday, denying rumors that he would be withdrawing from Shanghai. He stated, "People in Shanghai have been widely spreading rumors that the author plans to withdraw from Shanghai. The number of inquiries from radio listeners has reached several per day. My boss, fearing that I would leave Shanghai, paid me my monthly salary a week in advance. In fact, I currently have no plans to leave Shanghai. Apart from continuing my broadcasting career, I have no definite plans for the future. Last year, I had hoped for a three or four-week vacation, but this plan has now changed. For three years, except for Christmas, New Year, and the flood, I have been broadcasting on the radio regardless of the weather, without interruption."

### Bank of Communications - Shanghai Branch Relocates - New Address on Jing'an Temple Road

The Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications has recently leased the building at No. 999 Jing'an Temple Road, at the intersection of Moore Road, as the original address on Avenue Joffre was insufficient for office space. It will relocate to the new location today. The Savings and Trust Department of the bank, which was originally located at the intersection of Amherst Avenue and Route Voyron, will also move to the new location on Jing'an Temple Road on the same day. The branch of the bank on Avenue Joffre will continue to operate as usual at its original address, No. 889 Avenue Joffre.

### Shanghai Yiji Charity Association - Plans to Expand Dining Halls at Peace Hotel - Yu Qiaqing and Others Enthusiastically Help the Poor

The Shanghai Yiji Charity Association has been providing free meals and porridge for over three months, and has been able to maintain operations thanks to the enthusiastic donations of benefactors from all walks of life. In particular, Yu Qiaqing alone donated 100,000 yuan, benefiting the poor in no small measure. The association is chaired by Yu Qiaqing and Huang Jinrong, with Fan Kaitai as the executive director and Cheng Xiwen as the general director. Recently, there are plans to cancel the porridge distribution points and expand the free meal locations to twenty, each costing 10,000 yuan per month, totaling

### Chinese Guerrillas - Lay Mines in the Yangtze River

The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese side has announced that Chinese guerrillas, acting on orders from the authorities, are constantly laying mines in the Yangtze River. The Japanese Navy is continuing to clear them. No less than five floating mines were removed last week. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that ordinary merchant shipping along the Yangtze River is entirely safe. Furthermore, the Japanese Navy is implementing a blockade, searching 4,600 sailboats last week. Among them, twenty were carrying firearms and ammunition, which were confiscated, costing 200,000 yuan. The locations of the free meal distribution points that have already been determined include one at the Cotton Cloth Association at No. 406 Route des Pères, and one at the Tianhou Palace Refugee Relief Branch, No. 40. Others are being selected. At a time when the cost of living is high and rice prices are soaring, this move by the association is truly commendable. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will continue to donate generously, so that the association's work can be sustained permanently.

### Elementary School Students Save Candy Money - Donate to the New Pu Yu Orphanage

Xiao Yaorong and other students from the Muse Primary School in this city, seeing the reports in this newspaper about the financial difficulties of the New Pu Yu Orphanage, have been saving their candy money to make donations. The willingness of young students to do good deeds is a testament to the greatness of human compassion. The orphanage has received considerable donations from all walks of life, but it is still far from its goal. It is hoped that donations will continue. The donations received yesterday are listed below: Xiao Yaorong 4 yuan, Chen Wenrong 3 yuan, Chen Eping 2 yuan, Lin Shouyuan 2 yuan, Chen Shuqiao 1 yuan, Hu Zhenhua 1 yuan (all students from Muse Primary School), Zhu Ren 50 yuan, Zhang Xinhang 30 yuan, Mingji 20 yuan, anonymous 10 yuan, Ge Li'an 2 yuan, Hou Yujian 2 yuan. We would like to express our gratitude on behalf of the orphaned children of the orphanage. The location for donating goods to the orphanage is in yesterday's newspaper.

### Cotton Products Sold to Other Ports - Exemption from Registration and Approval for Sale

In order to expedite the procedure for applying for a certificate of Chinese goods for cotton products sold to other ports, starting from March 1st, the registration and approval procedures will be waived, and the procedure will be revised as follows: (1) Starting from March 1st, when cotton products are sold to other ports, six copies of the application form must be filled out to apply for a certificate of Chinese goods, and the sales receipts from the yarn factory or cloth factory used as raw materials must be attached. On the back of the receipt, a table should be used to indicate the date (i.e., the date of applying for the certificate for the finished product), the quantity of raw materials used (yarn indicated in kilograms, cloth indicated in pieces), and the remaining quantity. If the entire quantity is not used at once, after verifying the remaining quantity, the original receipt will be returned when the certificate is issued for continued use next time (when continuing to use, a table must still be used to indicate the quantity used on a certain date and whether there is any remaining quantity). After the remaining quantity is used up, the receipt will be cancelled and kept on file. (2) Those who have registered before and have not finished using will continue to have their receipts approved for sale until they are used up. (3) For those who applied for registration before March 1st but have not completed the registration procedure, the registration documents will be returned after verification, and the procedure will be carried out according to Article 1. Those that are still in the hands of the guild and have not been verified and transferred will be directly returned by the guild.

### French Inspector Lafon - Funeral Held Yesterday

After French Inspector Lafon of the French Concession police station died on March 2nd, the coffin was sealed at Guangci Hospital at 8:20 AM yesterday morning. After a memorial mass was held at Saint-Trobe Church on Rue Lutetia at 8:30 AM, the funeral procession proceeded along Route des Pères and Rue Sapeur to the Lujiawan Cemetery. Two small teams of Chinese and Vietnamese policemen held wreaths as the vanguard of the procession. The Superintendent of the French Concession Police and the bereaved family closely followed the coffin. Those who participated in the funeral included representatives from the French Consul General, the French Army, the French Municipal Council, the French Concession Police, special patrol officers, the fire brigade, and representatives from the Public Concession Police. After the coffin arrived at the cemetery, the Superintendent of the French Concession Police delivered a eulogy and presented a silver medal on behalf of the French Consul General.

### Salvation Army - Fundraising Nearing Target

The Salvation Army's fundraising campaign, as of yesterday, has received donations that are very close to the total of 175,000 yuan. Those who wish to donate can send their donations to the Salvation Army headquarters at 40 Nanjing Road, Sassoon House.

### Five Teachings Introduction - Deadline to Pick Up Books

Last June, Mr. Feng Bing and Mr. Liang held five days of lectures on the Five Teachings in honor of their mother's birthday, and at the same time, they distributed pre-booked tickets to the listeners for picking up the Introduction to the Five Teachings book. Since the lectures on the Five Teachings and the publication of the Introduction to the Five Teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam last year, there have been many people who have picked up the books with their tickets, but there are also those who have not. On the other hand, the number of schools, organizations, and individuals who have requested the books is even greater, making it difficult to cope. Therefore, the period for picking up books with tickets must come to an end before the books can be distributed to others. The deadline for picking up books with tickets is extended to the end of March. After this deadline, the tickets will be void, so that all remaining books can be transferred to those who love to read and request them. The location for picking up the books is at the Tongren Law Office, Feng Jishentang Accounting Office, at the intersection of Beijing Road and Museum Road.

### Woodhead's Impressions of Nanjing

Critic Woodhead, in his edited "Eastern Miscellany," published a travelogue of Nanjing, which reads: "The author traveled to Nanjing in March 1940 and revisited Nanjing in early February this year, taking advantage of rest and leave. Before taking a car, one must be approved by the Japanese military. Each person must submit two photos. Although there is no fee, one must fill out two lengthy forms, which takes at least five days, which is very inconvenient. In fact, the Japanese do not welcome foreigners to stay in Nanjing for too long. I requested to reside for three months, but the Japanese only allowed me to stay for ten days.

Today's Nanjing is not much different from Nanjing before November. Zhongshan Road has been slightly repaired, but it is still enough to damage the wheel springs of cars. On the small streets, there are cannonball marks and bomb craters everywhere, making it necessary to take detours. Some of the government offices are still in ruins. The city gate inspection is extremely strict. In addition to rigorous searches, Chinese and Japanese civilians must get out of the car and take off their hats to salute the Japanese soldiers. Only after walking through the city gate can they board the car again. The British and American governments have repeatedly made it clear to the Japanese authorities that they cannot tolerate British and American people saluting Japanese soldiers. However, this matter is still a cause of friction with the Japanese in Nanjing. Japanese sentries have even forced senior British and American naval personnel to get out of the car and walk into the city. The most troublesome procedure is at the Xiaguan city gate, where foreigners frequently enter and exit because of the Jardine Matheson factory, which is extremely inconvenient. The most friction occurs at the city gate where foreigners enter and exit to go to the golf course.

From today's perspective, Nanjing has completely become a Japanese military garrison, which is much worse than when I visited in March 1940. Japanese soldiers, Japanese sailors, Japanese flags, and Japanese military vehicles can be seen everywhere and at all times in the streets. Important buildings are guarded by Japanese soldiers, and many large properties have been requisitioned by the Japanese military. Foreign merchants in Nanjing have no business to speak of. The larger factories still retain a minimal number of staff to oversee the assets. Foreign-owned industries on the banks of the river are still under Japanese military occupation. The only foreign trade that survives now is a small amount of kerosene and cigarettes. Daily necessities such as flour, sugar, matches, butter, and coal are extremely scarce in Nanjing. Fees for electricity, telephone, and tap water must be paid with military scrip. There are many wild chickens in the mountains near the city, so people are allowed to shoot them. Nanjing has lost its former status as an educational center. The universities only retain a few Chinese and Western staff to guard the buildings.

The author spoke with a Japanese soldier who said that the appearance of Nanjing was very much like a Japanese military garrison. The officer said that the troops maintaining security were still in training and that the Japanese garrison could withdraw "soon." However, the author, seeing the Japanese military's requisition of real estate and attempts to seize foreign-owned properties, did not think it looked like they were planning a short stay.

It has been over a year since the Japanese officially declared the opening of the Yangtze River below Nanjing, but there has been no intention to implement it. Today, the only foreign ships that can sail past Nanjing are the American gunboats in the Yangtze River. The large ones travel between Shanghai and Wuhu once a month, passing through Zhenjiang and Nanjing. The American gunboats that sail to Hankou only come once every three months and must be accompanied by Japanese warships for "protection." Everyone is surprised why foreigners are not very enthusiastic about traveling to Nanjing. In fact, if the procedures were not so cumbersome, foreigners would not be so hesitant. In addition to a permit, I was also required to have a cholera vaccination certificate, a smallpox certificate, and other cumbersome procedures. Therefore, although Nanjing has beautiful mountains and scenery, it cannot arouse the interest of foreigners."

### British and Japanese Candidates for Municipal Council - May Be Announced This Week - Rumor That the Japanese Side Will Nominate Five More - British and Americans Hope to Maintain the Status Quo

The Municipal Council elections are less than a month away, but the British and Japanese residents of the Public Concession have not yet "made a decision" regarding the nomination of candidates for the Municipal Council. As of yesterday, neither side had nominated candidates. The American residents previously nominated Oliver and Mills to participate in this year's election through the American Residents Association. The Japanese side remained silent yesterday morning regarding the question of when the election would begin, but hinted that the Japanese election campaign might begin this week. It is believed that the Japanese side will follow last year's practice and nominate five candidates, hoping that all five will be elected. The British and Americans, however, hope to maintain the status quo, that is, to maintain the gentleman's agreement of nine British directors, two American directors, and one Japanese director. The British residents are expected to nominate candidates this week and hold a primary election before the 15th of this month. McDonald, an independent British candidate who participated in the Municipal Council election last year, told reporters yesterday morning that he might participate in the election again this year, but he has not yet made a decision and will not announce it until the day before the deadline for submitting candidates (March 16).

### Municipal Council Sues Resident for House Tax

The Fang case has attracted attention from all walks of life. Now, the Municipal Council is in dispute with Mr. Shan Yuhua, a lawyer at No. 118 Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, over house tax in the First Special District Court. Lawyer Shan Yuhua has resided in Dazhong Lane for many years. The house he lives in is old, so the landlord has not increased the rent. However, Shan opposes the Municipal Council's collection of taxes based on the proportion of rent increases in the lane and insists on paying taxes based on the landlord's rent receipt. Therefore, the Municipal Council refused to accept the house tax for last winter and this spring. Shan, based on the rent receipt, calculated the amount of tax and sent a check to the Municipal Council. Although the Municipal Council accepted it, they claimed that it was still 20 yuan and 4 jiao short. Shan argued that the Municipal Council has always based its tax collection on rent receipts, and many residents in the lane have not had their rent increased, and they all pay taxes based on rent receipts. Therefore, Shan opposed the Municipal Council's actions, leading to litigation. Yesterday, Judge Guo of the First Special District Court opened a civil court and summoned both parties. The arguments were fierce. The court stated that although both parties had their own arguments, the facts were clear. The trial was concluded, and a verdict was scheduled for the 8th.

### Public Buses and Trucks - Crushed Two Children to Death - Families Searched - Repeated Admonitions

On Yunnan Road and Zhifu Road in the Public Concession, at around 5:00 PM yesterday, a student, about fourteen or fifteen years old, wearing a blue cloth gown, with a shaved head, and a Jinghai Primary School badge hanging on his lapel, was walking through the area when a truck sped past. The truck failed to avoid him, causing him to be knocked to the ground, his skull crushed, and he died on the spot. Chinese police officers from Laozha No. 3400 arrived, recorded the vehicle number of the truck, and sent the body to Renji Hospital for examination at the coroner's office. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a No. 10 public bus (vehicle number 1503) was speeding west on Connaught Road at the intersection of Tokyo Road when a Ningbo child named Zhang Jiaying (eight years old) suddenly tried to cross the road from north to south. The bus failed to avoid him and knocked him down. His whole body rolled under the wheels, his brains splattered, his abdomen was ruptured, and his intestines spilled out. The scene was too gruesome to bear. Police officers at the post rushed to the scene and urgently summoned an ambulance. The child was sent to Baolong Hospital, but due to his severe injuries, he had already died by the time he arrived at the hospital.

### Waiter Training at the Dahua Hotel

The Dahua Hotel, a giant in the Hong Kong hotel industry, is excellently equipped and pays attention to the training of its waiters. The current waiters have all received education above the secondary level. Its daily customers are mostly domestic and foreign dignitaries and celebrities. Because of the influence of the hotel's environment, its staff are extraordinary. Recently, the hotel has been recruiting a number of waiters aged between 16 and 18 with a junior high school education level in Shanghai. The treatment after being hired is excellent. During the training period, in addition to daily work, university professors are specially hired to teach various basic knowledge. The registration office is at Huimin Company, No. 451 Jiangxi Road.

### Small Suitcase Waiting to Be Claimed

At 8:45 AM yesterday, someone left a black suitcase in the third-class compartment of a No. 1 tramcar near the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lutetia. It is probably a student's schoolbag. Ticket seller No. 595 is responsible for keeping it. The owner can claim it from the tram company.

### Robbed Men's Overcoats Waiting to Be Claimed

At 9:00 PM on February 26th, Chinese police officer No. 813 of the French Concession police station encountered an armed robber and two accomplices on Rue Bourgeat as they were stripping an overcoat from a Chinese man. He immediately arrested them. The robber, named He Erchang, also known as Wang Ailin, 24 years old, residing in Shanghai 4, confessed that in February this year, he and two accomplices who are still at large robbed pedestrians of their clothes multiple times on Rue Bourgeat, Rue Maignan, and Rue Kraetzer. Detectives from the French Concession police station are displaying four men's overcoats at various police stations. Three of them have not been claimed by their owners. The owners are requested to see the newspaper and go to the detective office of the French Concession police station at No. 22 Rue Sherva Litzky to claim them as soon as possible.

### Weather Report

The Zikawei Observatory reported at 4:30 PM yesterday that Shandong and its surroundings were sunny and cold, with fog and southeast to southwest winds. It was sunny and warmer here, with fog in the morning and north to east winds. In the coastal areas south of Ma'an Island, it was cloudy with strong northeast monsoon winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 50.2 degrees and the lowest was 28.2 degrees.

### Meat Eaters Are Base

— Jue Hui

"Meat eaters are base," is truly a bit "inexplicable." However, based on sentiment, perhaps it is because of "killing."

Of course, this "meat" specifically refers to: pigs, cattle, sheep... certainly not people!

But now there are actually "cannibals." Not only are there some, but there are also many.

Dogs are used to eating feces and do not feel the stench of feces. People have been "eating people" for a long time and do not feel that "cannibals" are "eating people." This is quite in line with the principles of "nature"...

"If you don't want people to know, don't do it." "Eating people" may be "natural," but the "bloody smell" and "bones left over" are still easily discovered by others, leading to resistance. Appeals to lower rice prices and requests to sanction hoarders are ironclad proof! (Although the result of appeals and requests may be "only hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but not seeing anyone come down.")

Therefore, "meat eaters" are more than just "base"!

### Don't Be Fooled by the "Superior Person" Anymore

— Xu Daming

"One must endure bitterness to become a superior person."

This proverb is often what kind and honest elders use to advise those restless young fellows. However, sometimes it becomes a "spiritual medicine" for people to comfort themselves. As a result, all the "hidden tricky problems" contained within it are ignored.

I think someone will definitely ask, "This is clearly a 'golden saying,' how can you arbitrarily speak nonsense and overturn the teachings of the ancients?" True, this is an "ancient teaching," but could it be that ancient teachings are absolutely without error? I believe there is probably no one who dares to answer that it is "absolutely" without error.

Well then, since there is error, we must find the root cause of the error in this, and we can no longer let it continue to be wrong as before it was discovered, or even keep silent and not say a word. Because in the past we ourselves have been deceived, we must tell others the secrets within it, so that they can awaken and strive to truly be a person.

First of all, we must point out that the "golden saying" "One must endure bitterness to become a superior person" is an outright self-deception, and "ghost talk" that tells people to only "be content with their lot" and "resign themselves to fate," and wipes out people's enterprising thoughts. And for many years, society has been ruled by the feudal system under these two sentences, causing thousands of miserable people to be unable to turn over; at the same time, they don't even think about turning over. This is truly the same as using "fatalism" to deceive people.

However, things are not that simple. Fatalists tell you that your own "fate" is bitter, so you should be bitter for life, and don't think about this or that anymore. In this way, you are quite simply destined to be a slave forever. But "One must endure bitterness to become a superior person" goes a step further. You might as well be a slave first, and it will be good to turn over in the future, but the condition for turning over is that you must first be like a beast of burden, otherwise, you shouldn't even think about becoming a "superior person" in the future! As a result, many people are deceived into being obedient, and they are even willing to die like beasts of burden without a word of complaint.

However, our deceived ones seem to be a bit too honest. Look: the exploited friends are now "inferior" people, with "superior" people high above; but if the inferior people climb to the position of superior people (but this is a minority among minorities), then there are still countless masses under them, the only difference is that you yourself have risen.

But, unfortunately, the unfolding of the tragedy lies in this one root cause: because there are superior people, there are also inferior people, so everyone wants to be a superior person, so the inferior people desperately want to climb up, push, and attack. As a result, it turns into a struggle between inferior people and superior people. In this way, the entire society, the entire world, and the entire humanity today are forever being twisted in this vortex, unable to find peace or stillness.

Therefore, we want to appeal, we are not willing to be inferior people, but at the same time we absolutely don't want to be superior people, but hope that people in this world are all equal and mutually beneficial, and are people who do not distinguish between superior and inferior! And our work today should be to thoroughly transform the current social system where there are people above people, and even dozens of layers of superior people!

### Spring

— Written by Lü Sha

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

"There's a way!" He ran up the thirty-odd steps, panting like an old ox that had just plowed three acres of land. "Let's go see Mrs. Yuan first!"

He grabbed Begonia's plump hand, as if he wanted her to leave immediately.

"But is Commander Yuan here?" Begonia asked, not quite daring to believe it.

"It doesn't matter whether Third Master is here or not," Zhao Si grabbed a torn black呢 hat, held it in his left hand, and fanned himself like a fan, and his fat face was indeed sweating from exhaustion. "Mrs. Hu here has dealings with the wives of Governor Ma's secretaries. You just need to see her!"

Begonia felt that what he said seemed very reasonable, and he had indeed been a little dizzy from the harassment of those hooligans just now, so he didn't have time to think about anything else, and really stood up and followed Zhao Si. It wasn't until he found Yuan Baofan's golden house, and met Ji Zhaoxiong, one of Yuan Baofan's most trusted orderlies, at the door, that he felt that he had come too rashly.

"Ah! This matter may be a little difficult." Ji Zhaoxiong first let Begonia and Zhao Si into the reception room, listened to them explain the purpose of their visit, and then frowned his triangular eyebrows, and from his pair of deep-set eye sockets, sent out two strange sharp rays of light, turned around a few times on Begonia's face, and slowly said, "Hasn't the Madam here never met you before? Boss Wu.... But, it's really to your credit that you were able to find out!"

"I ran for half a day to find out." Zhao Si said as if very proud, "Now that we're here, please help us ask!"

Ji Zhaoxiong's face still revealed a very embarrassed expression. "You don't know! This Madam's temper is really very different from the three in Beijing!" He lowered his voice, deliberately pretending to be very confidential, and said, "The Commander is also a little afraid of her. And what she hates most is opera singers. In the past, when the Commander was in Beijing, didn't he invite many of you good actors to his house to sing and drink every day? But it's not okay here! He simply doesn't dare to bring in unrelated people....”

Before he could finish his words, Begonia was almost disappointed and about to leave.

"But, the friendship between our boss and Third Master and Seventh Master is somewhat different from others, they should know that inside too!" Zhao Si still refused to give up this avenue. "Please help us, Brother, and try to see if it works?"

The orderly still shook his head. (46)

### A Day's Diary

— Unemployed Person

I got up very early and saw my mother already folding gold paper by the dim stove corner. Her gaunt face was covered with endless sorrow, and I knew that there was no more food at home for me to eat.

Without even drinking a drop of boiled water, I ran out of the house with a few test guides and past papers.

Fortunately, I still had a ragged and dirty blue cloth gown to wear, and I took advantage of the fact that the manager was tidying up the magazines to sneak into the reading room of the ×-year association.

Flipping through the newspapers on the newspaper rack, I still didn't see the "Hunger" article that I had sent out ten days ago published, which made me very worried and angry; my mind immediately realized the passage in the book that Hamsun wrote, saying: "The large wastepaper basket with its dragon mouth in the editor's office seems to be able to swallow even human bones!"

As soon as I sat down and didn't even read three pages, the light of hunger had already begun to crowd into my eyeballs. It made me lose the ability to recognize every word on the book, and when I looked up, I suddenly saw my face reflected on the large glass opposite me, which made me jump up. Just half a month of unemployment had made my cheeks sunken, my eyes deep-set, and my pale and bluish face was covered with disheveled, withered hair.

I no longer had the courage to sit there and read; so I quickly withdrew. When my weak arm pushed the fan-spring door, the manager's sharp eyes swept directly over me, nailing on the few books under my arm. I wasn't afraid of this, but what I was afraid of was that he would ask me for my "membership card".

The compulsion of hunger made me no longer think about the word "face". At this time, I seemed to have walked to a silk shop on Nanjing Road to find my uncle.

Although moved by his sympathy, he agreed to lend me a dollar, but when he went in to get the money, the "high-nosed" leather shoes kicked me. I couldn't stand his encore, so of course I had to leave, and who can you blame for not being able to borrow money and eating "foreign ham"?

Lowering my head, I stroked my wound in an alley and saw a five-cent bill falling out of a child's pocket. At this time, I didn't know what "honesty" and "shame" were, and I quickly reached out and picked it up, and then happily slipped out.

At a stall, I used this five cents to buy a sesame cake and put it in my mouth. Although it was a dry and hard thing, it was moistened by saliva and immediately turned into a "food ball" rolling in my mouth, emitting a delicious sweet taste. I thought: thirty-five dollars for a big dish, in the mouths of those rich people who are full of warmth all day long, there is definitely no such delicious taste, right? I became proud and proud, tightly choking my throat and chewing carefully, hoping that this "food ball" would exist forever, but in a moment, my mouth was empty again.

When I returned home, my mother was still sitting by the dim stove corner, folding paper ingots taken from the tinfoil shop. Looking at her red and swollen eyes, I knew she had been crying. I took off the "one and only" blue cloth gown on my body and handed it to her, saying, "Mom, don't be sad anymore. In a few days, when the postman informs me that I've been hired, won't we be able to live? Take this clothes to pawn, buy some rice, and cook some porridge to drink."

### Talking About Liu Yanting

— Danran

When discussing famous net performers in the North and South, people only know Hao Jinhou and Li, but they don't mention Liu Yanting at all, which makes me very confused. In addition to his loud and solid voice, Hao's practice of calligraphy has strength, and his singing style, facial makeup, and body movements do not follow the mainstream. Shaoshan's voice is strong and his stage presence is majestic, but his singing style and body movements are a major shortcoming. Ju Xi has no voice and is also thin and small, only maintaining his air and style, and is not a complete talent for painted faces. Li Chunheng's voice is full and suitable for both bronze hammer and frame roles. Dramas such as "Stealing the Imperial Horse," "Loyalty and Filial Piety," "Puqiu Mountain," and "Beating the Dragon Robe" are no less than Hao Jinhou. In recent years, he has worked hard to learn from Hao Shouchang, and his fierceness is quite similar, but his status has instead declined because of this. Li is comparable to Hao in age and cannot be placed between Sun Shengwen, Yuan Shihai, Qiu Shengrong, and Wang Quankui. He cannot be mentioned alongside Hao Jinhou, and cannot be included in the younger generation of painted faces. Therefore, the name Li Chunheng is not noticed by outsiders.

Liu Yanting is the brother of Liu Yanfang, Yang Xiaolou's beloved son-in-law, and has long been with Xiaolou. There was originally Qian Jinfu as a martial net performer in Xiaolou's troupe, so Yanting was the second-tier martial net performer in the troupe; and below Qian Jinfu, there was also Xu Yintang's son Xu Deyi. Liu's position in Yang's troupe was below Xu Deyi, so he sometimes also performed second-tier frame plays. He privately admired Huang Runfu and Jin Xiushan very much. Guan Tai in "Luoma Lake" and the big boss in "Chain Set" must be played by Yanting. When Yang Xiaolou posted "Changban Slope," Zhang Fei was Qian Jinfu, Cao Hong was Xu Deyi, and Yanting was assigned to play Zhang Liao. When Xiaolou came out for the last time, because Qian Jinfu was old and did not participate, Liu Yanting replaced Qian in singing: Li Pei in "Luoma Lake," Zhang Fei in "Changban Slope," Jin Wuzhu in "Picking the Carriage," and Sima Shi in "Iron Dragon Mountain" were not inferior to Qian Jinfu. Quanfu had no voice, and Yanting could sing, so this was indeed better than him. A few years ago, Hao Shouchang resigned from the troupe for some reason, and Yang Xiaolou assigned Yanting to perform all of Hao's plays, and the performance was no less wonderful than Shouchang. Since Hao returned to Yang's troupe, Liu has followed Tan Fuying to travel north and south; Liu Jin in "Famen Temple," Xia Houlun in "Dingjun Mountain," Ma Su in "Empty City Stratagem," Huang Gai in "Gathering of Heroes," Chen Youliang in "Battle of Taiping," Xian Mi in "Picking the Tassels," Bao Gong in "Pot Case," Jin Wuzhu in "Eight Great Hammers," Niu Gao in "Zhenjizhou," and Zhou Dewei in "Pearl Curtain Village" were all not weak; among them, the roles of Ma Su and Xia Houlun were especially excellent, and seemed to be better than Cheng Shaoyu, who is famous in the South for these two roles. I once saw him perform "Shiyang Garden," "Gucheng Association" (substituting for his younger brother), and "Down to Hedong" with Li Hongchun, which can be called good plays. He occasionally performed "Qingfeng Village" and "Taking Luoyang" and was also outstanding. Feng Xiaoyin, a critic of operas, rarely praises current actors, but he has a unique eye for Yanting, saying "Watching Hao Hou's plays is like watching Liu Yanting." This is because Yanting's art is simple and unadorned, without arrogance or affectation. This is why Mr. Feng abandoned Hao Hou and took Liu Yanting.

### The Philosophy of a Struggling Life

— Zong Yu

Before struggling, you need to know some theories of struggle; and the completion of the theory lies entirely in practice. You can only constantly struggle with adversity, and after a long time and many failures, you can gradually complete your theory, which is unbreakable.

Chapter 1 Where in Life Do We Not Meet?

I muddled through a few years, and with the help of my brothers, I actually had food and clothing and lived a carefree life. But when I asked myself in quiet, I wondered if this copper-筋铁肋 body of mine was born to be buried in this wilderness, unable to wield a sword and perform meritorious service for the country, go to battle and kill thieves, and leave behind a beautiful name in history? I couldn't help but feel a little unwilling. Later, I met a person in the Jianghu that I knew, named Chai Ying. He was going to join the army at Wu Sangui's military headquarters in Shanhaiguan. He advised me not to do this Green Forest life, but to abandon darkness and return to righteousness, and also go to the official army to serve. I agreed to him and let him stay on the mountain for a few days. When he was about to leave, he said to me that if he was accepted into the army, he would ask someone to send me a letter. Sure enough, less than a year after he left, a person came with a letter from him, calling me to go with him. Therefore, I disbanded the gang and went down the mountain to embark on the journey to join General Wu. I only carried my two treasures with me: one was the black horse tied outside the door, whose whole body was pure black, with long hooves and round ears, and it was really capable of traveling a thousand miles a day and eight hundred miles a night. In addition, there was a Ling Bao sword, which was left over from the Wei and Jin dynasties. Zhang Cangqiu pressed his hand on the hilt of the sword at his waist, smiled very proudly, and then continued: "Today I passed by here, and I was just about to ask someone for a meal, but I heard you reading aloud, and you were reading very nicely. I couldn't help but disturb you. But in today's world, a great chaos is about to rise. What is the use of you studying behind closed doors here, even if you study well? I haven't asked the host's name yet, but I've already said too much. Please tell me."

When the young man heard his words, he felt that his speech was very straightforward and worthy of being a strong man in the wind and dust. He himself had always admired wandering knights, thinking that the disciples of Zhujia and Guo Jie were rare in this world. Today, meeting this uninvited guest, he had the appearance of a Qiu Songgong-like figure, and it was even more commendable that he could lay down his butcher knife and resolve to join the army. So he was very happy and said, "My name is Xu, and my given name is Jing. I have lived here outside Qixian City for generations. My late father was an old scholar, and he never took a meritorious name in his life. He had no choice but to irrigate and farm the fields, and died of old age under the window. When he was about to die, he repeatedly told me to study hard and to express his repressed feelings for him in the future. Unfortunately, I don't like the study of the examination system. Although I passed the boy's examination, I failed the exam several times after that, which almost completely discouraged me. I study behind closed doors here to serve my old mother, confined like a foal under the shaft. Please don't laugh at me, strong man." (3)

### Random Notes from the Art World

— Shouwu

Xinhua Company recently had a "Lightning" plan, imitating the precedent of "Lianhua Symphony", inviting directors and stars to cooperate on a "National League Symphony". After a meeting of giants, it was decided to change the original proposal and use all this energy on the filming of "Home". "Home" has been performed by the Shanghai Drama Art Society and has been fully booked since then, so Xinhua's move has a "business eye".

After Zhao Zhiyou rented the Xuan Palace Theater for a price of 20,000 yuan, there were rumors that the Shanghai Drama Art Society would move to the Xuan Palace to perform, and would be renamed "China Art Theater". According to the latest information, this statement was originally 70% reliable, but it is now a thing of the past.

Director Situ Weimin of Hong Kong New Life Company's "Love of the Motherland" will not start until the middle of this month, and is now recruiting male and female actors. Judging from the literal meaning, the film is about the life of overseas Chinese, so the location may be filmed in Java or the Philippines.

Minhua's "Song of Ancient China" filmed "Flooding the Seven Armies" yesterday. Ruidebao played Guan Gong and Liang Lianzhu played Zhou Cang, which is a rare combination. Rui's Guan Gong opera was once offered to the Qing court. The exquisite nature of his art can be imagined, and from now on, "offering" will be shared with the public. As for Liang Lianzhu, he is a veteran of the Fu Liancheng troupe. Among the net performers in Shanghai, counting heads, he is indispensable. No wonder so many people came to visit and watch the show, all to appreciate the art of drama.

### Movie City Trends

— Huilin

Alfred Hitchcock, the British director of "Rebecca", is working hard to complete another masterpiece, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith". He searched for a suitable actress for the film among 225 girls, but was still disappointed. So he complained, "There isn't a single beautiful woman in all of Hollywood." This is really a strange story in the movie city!

Even now, some people still regret the breakup of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The musicals they collaborated on, such as "Swing Time" and "Follow the Fleet", are still deeply imprinted in the minds of movie fans. Since breaking up, both of them have been depressed and have not found a satisfactory partner, although Ginger Rogers has changed her style.

May Robson, who specializes in playing stubborn old ladies on the screen, has dedicated herself to the film industry for 56 years. She has a great-granddaughter who is four years old and is now training her to become a child star on the stage. With Robson's experience and knowledge and the child's talent, that great-granddaughter has a great chance of becoming the second Shirley Temple.

James Cagney, the "killer" on the screen, has become even more popular with movie fans since the release of "City for Conquest", and there is hope of winning an Oscar. Cagney's recent work is "The Strawberry Blonde", co-starring with Rita Hayworth and Olivia de Havilland, directed by the great director Raoul Walsh.
