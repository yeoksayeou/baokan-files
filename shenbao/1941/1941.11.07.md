### If the Japanese Army Invades Yunnan from Vietnam, the United States and Britain Will Defend the Burma Road. Chinese Reinforcements and Military Supplies Are Rushed to the Guangxi Border. The Japanese Army in Vietnam Hastily Builds Airfields and Establishes Hospitals.

Chongqing: Although political circles in China, Britain, and the United States are keeping silent on this matter, it is widely believed that if the Japanese army attacks Kunming from Vietnam, hoping to cut off the Burma Road, the United States and Britain will definitely not stand idly by. An observer stated that maintaining the passage of the Burma Road for the United States and Britain, so that China can continue to fight in the Far East, is no less important than maintaining the Soviet Union's combat in Europe. Although it is not yet possible to predict what methods will be taken to help China cope with this battle, it is widely believed that British and American aircraft will be used to protect the highway. Although foreign military experts here with inside information acknowledge the possibility of the Japanese army attacking Kunming, they all believe that this will not happen in the near future. Their belief is based on the current strength of the Japanese army in Vietnam. The Japanese army currently stationed in Vietnam is less than 70,000, with 150 aircraft, 50 stationed in Tokyo, and 100 stationed in southern Vietnam. The Japanese army must mobilize 200,000 troops and 400 aircraft to carry out this task. The area along the Sino-Vietnamese border between Lao Cai and Mengzi is rugged and difficult to conquer easily. However, China's highest military authorities do not want to relax their vigilance because of this. In addition to sending reinforcements to the Yunnan-Guangxi border, they are also rushing to transport military supplies to prepare for the eventuality. (Reuters dispatch on the 6th)

Chongqing: Chinese military officials recently told the Associated Press that China has concentrated sufficient troops on the Yunnan-Guangxi border to deal with the Japanese invasion of Chinese territory. The number of Chinese troops is unknown due to military secrecy. However, the contents include not only elite Chinese troops but also mechanized units, heavy artillery units, and cavalry units trained specifically for combat in the difficult terrain of Yunnan. The above-mentioned troops have been stationed in Yunnan Province since the Japanese army began occupying Vietnam, and they are quite accustomed to the climate and environment of Yunnan. Moreover, they have been trained in a timely manner and are very familiar with the terrain of Yunnan. This determined army has long been preparing to meet the enemy.

The Ta Kung Pao commented that China is fully prepared to resist Japan's attack on Yunnan from Vietnam and urged Britain and the United States to make similar military preparations in Malaya and Burma.

### Giant Panda Presentation Ceremony Held in Chongqing

Chongqing: Mr. Deven, a representative of the New York Zoo, went to Chengdu last Thursday to receive the giant pandas donated by Madame Chiang Kai-shek. He will bring them to Chongqing this afternoon. Mr. Graham, the original captor, will come along. A presentation ceremony will be held this afternoon, and US Ambassador Gauss will accept them on behalf of American aid groups in China. Madame Chiang will deliver a radio address to the United States on the spot to thank them for their assistance to China over the years. It is reported that the main point of the speech is to explain that the medicines and other materials donated by kind-hearted Americans can be continuously transported in through the Burma Road, not only every day, but also day and night, continuously transported inland. The Chinese side will distribute these items to all parts of the country. All wounded soldiers, disaster victims, orphans, and unfortunate people under natural disasters and plagues will receive much grace. Although materials are more difficult in the Chinese mainland now, the working people are doing their best in the simple bamboo shed and mud houses. However, special materials cannot be used to create instruments, so it is still hoped that American friends can continue to help. Now, in order to express its gratitude for this friendship, China will present the newly acquired giant pandas so that they can be displayed in the New York Zoo for American children to appreciate this rare and beautiful animal produced in China. There are two giant pandas, one weighing more than one hundred pounds and the other weighing only forty pounds. After the clipper ship is properly arranged, it will be transported to the port and transferred to the United States. Therefore, people in Chongqing can feast their eyes before the Americans.

### Burmese Fever Discovered in Chongqing

Chongqing: American experts who will eradicate malaria in the Chinese mainland are preparing to go to the Kunming-Lashio railway area today because a new disease called "Burmese fever" has been discovered here. According to medical reports, "Burmese fever" is the first discovery in the Chinese mainland and is probably transmitted from the interior of Burma to Chongqing by travelers and car drivers via the Burma Road. The disease is similar to malaria but has no chills. Patients have very high temperatures. According to medical circles, it will take a considerable amount of time to determine the nature of the disease. Dr. Wright, an American malaria expert who participated in the eradication of malaria in the Panama Canal area, is scheduled to leave for the Kunming-Lashio railway area on Saturday. The area is about 17 miles south of the road on the Sino-Burmese border and covers an area of 200 square miles. Dr. Wright told the Associated Press that Dr. Haas, the leader of the US medical delegation, is scheduled to leave Chongqing for the same location on November 11 with 16 other members of the delegation. Dr. Wright said that they are rushing to the worst malaria-prone area in Asia because without their malaria prevention preparations, the railway cannot be built. The doctor also said that 150,000 workers have gathered in Yunnan Province, waiting for the delegation to clear the epidemic area in the Chinese territory adjacent to the Burmese border before going to work.

### Carrying a Plan Approved by the Japanese Emperor, Kurusu Passed Through Hong Kong This Morning En Route to America: Japan Attempts a Final Effort to Break the Deadlock, But Without Changing Policy, Results Will Be Hard to Achieve

Washington, 5th - Diplomatic circles here are very interested in Tokyo's sudden dispatch of Kurusu to America, but the US government apparently does not attach particular importance to it or place great hope on it. Kurusu will take a Clipper plane to America on the 7th. Since Pan American Airways expanded its Far East routes, this is the first time it has permitted a Japanese person to travel on a Clipper plane. Although the Japanese side claims that this decision to send Kurusu to America does not mean that Japan is yielding to the US, observers here believe that this action sufficiently demonstrates Japan's extremely embarrassed and uneasy state. Japan is deeply aware of the possibility that the US may halt talks, while Japan is eager to continue them. The general public in Washington is very pessimistic about the outcome of Kurusu's visit, believing that if Japan insists on continuing the Sino-Japanese war and pursuing a policy of aggression in the Pacific, Kurusu's visit will be futile, no different from Nomura and Wakasugi's. Some observers believe that the purpose of Kurusu's visit is to delay time, slow down the outbreak of clashes in the Pacific, and hope that China's current economic blockade against Japan can be implemented more leniently. According to Japanese sources, Kurusu intends to explain the US-Japan situation to the US President and various authorities, but observers believe that the US President and various authorities are well aware of Japan's plans and conspiracies, as well as Japan's internal "difficulties in the international situation, the serious impact of the economic blockade on Japan, the situation in the rear, and the pressure from the military in Japan," etc. Well-informed sources say that the US willingness to continue talks with Japan is not an indication of US appeasement towards Japan. The consistent policy of the US government is to find ways to prevent Japan from making small-minded conjectures and doubts about the second step of the US, and it will definitely continue to promote its consistent policy in the future. There is absolutely no sign of US officialdom compromising with Japan or changing its current policy. The press generally anticipates that unless Japan undergoes a political transformation, abandons its aggressive policy, and reaches a solution based on the principles of international law, Kurusu or anyone else from Japan who comes here will inevitably fail completely.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - Kurusu, the former ambassador to Germany, left here by plane yesterday morning for Hong Kong, scheduled to take a Clipper plane to the US on the 7th, and is expected to arrive in Washington on the 17th.

United Press, Hong Kong, 6th - Consul General Kurusu will arrive in Hong Kong by Japanese special plane on the morning of the 7th.

Reuters, New York, 6th - According to a Washington dispatch, the Japanese envoy, Kurusu Saburo, who is departing for America, is said to be carrying a plan approved by the Japanese Emperor for the peaceful resolution of US-Japan issues. Diplomatic circles in the capital believe that Kurusu may be carrying a private letter from Japanese Prime Minister Tojo to President Roosevelt, containing proposals aimed at achieving what Japan considers a satisfactory solution.

Reuters, Washington, 6th - Secretary of State Hull told reporters last night that the arrival of Japanese special envoy Kurusu in America was not at the invitation of the US, and the US government has absolutely no involvement in Kurusu's trip, but will only provide courteous treatment in terms of travel convenience. The Japanese government has notified the US State Department that Kurusu will cooperate with Japanese Ambassador to the US Nomura to continue the exploratory talks between the US and Japan.

United Press, Washington, 6th - Reliable sources said yesterday that unless Japan is prepared to change its aggressive policy, Kurusu Saburo will receive a cold reception. Observers here believe that the US is prepared to continue talks with Japan, but will not be intimidated by any time limit warnings. Such intimidation is that unless the US immediately expresses a sincere attitude in the talks, Japan will risk war. Reliable sources say that unless the Japanese army agrees to withdraw from China and abandon its plans for a "Co-Prosperity Sphere," the US government has no intention of relaxing its current position.

### The Nine-Power Treaty Cannot Be Unilaterally Abolished

Reuters, Washington, 6th - Seven Japanese conditions that the US must accept, published in Tokyo's Japan Times, were reprinted here yesterday by newspapers under the headline "Japan's Must-Have Conditions," but did not cause alarm among readers. The Japan Times is an organ of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Since the Foreign Ministry knows from its representatives in the US that the US will never accept any conditions more absurd than those Japan has put forward in the Washington talks, why publish them in its official newspaper? This is something that some people cannot understand. One might speculate that these conditions are Japan's way of breaking off the deadlocked US-Japan talks. But then why is Japan sending Kurusu to America to continue the talks? The general impression is that these conditions are like Hitler's pronouncements and should be treated the same way. According to well-informed observers, if the US were to recognize these conditions, it would not only be an accomplice to Japanese aggression, but also tear up the Nine-Power Treaty. As for the US policy of defeating Hitlerism, it goes without saying that it would be completely overturned. Japan probably does not harbor delusions and would not dare to hold such expectations. So unless these conditions are another act of psychological warfare, why publish them? It should be known that, from the US standpoint, Japan's psychological warfare has failed every time from beginning to end. All parties say that if Kurusu comes to America with conditions similar to those mentioned above, it will be a futile journey and a waste of time. The general impression here is also that the new attacks on the US by Tokyo newspapers and Kurusu's hurried departure show that Tokyo's anxiety and panic are increasing day by day. Japan is now in a dilemma, facing a difficult situation. On the one hand, there are obligations to the Axis powers. Japan has not yet satisfied Germany, and the pressure to urge it to participate in the war is increasing. On the other hand, there are the interests of US-Japan relations. If Japan allows this relationship to deteriorate further and leads to open war, Japan will inevitably lose its wealth. Foreign communications reports that the summoning of the Japanese parliament and Tojo's remarks expressing hope that the US will provide a concrete response by November 15 are seen in Washington as a dangerous and coercive pressure. Japan's policy now seeks to test the strength of the US, British, and Soviet resolve in various ways. The recent attacks by Japanese troops on the Kraskino border have provoked protests from the Soviet Union and a clear expression that Japan is willing to fight if it wants to provoke a conflict. The talks between Under Secretary of State Welles and Nomura's advisor Wakasugi were mostly aimed at elucidating Japan's viewpoints, but now it has reached the stage where the US explains its own viewpoints. In short, the US position is based on the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees China's territorial integrity and the Open Door Policy, and this treaty cannot be unilaterally abolished. This is also the statement of the Foreign Communications Weekly. The US demand that Japan withdraw its troops from China, as admitted by Japanese officials, stems from this, because the Japanese army's occupation of Chinese territory is a clear violation of China's territorial integrity. The threat from the Japanese side that there will be certain consequences and possibilities after November 15 has never had any impact here. It is also said that the US will increase its financial assistance to China and that the US will temporarily manage the Burma Road. All these situations show that Japan's "must-have conditions" are merely a laughing stock. Although the US has not threatened Japan, if the word "must" has indeed been used, it would be more appropriate to say that it is used for Washington rather than for Tokyo.

Lubian News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - The Japan Times stated tonight that Kurusu's mission to the US is the last opportunity for the US to avoid a Pacific war. Everything will depend on the US, as it depends on the US to seize this last opportunity to correct its aggression and restore a peaceful solution. Kurusu's mission across the Pacific should show the US that Japan wants to give the US an opportunity to understand the character of the Japanese people before turning its policy into action. The US should respond to Japan with constructive actions and straightforward efforts to curb disaster. The Tojo Cabinet can now announce to the Japanese people that the government's efforts to persuade the US not to stubbornly follow an intolerable path have reached their final limit. Although the contents of the document carried by Kurusu have not been disclosed, the basic need to resolve the China incident and the acceptance of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will not change. The US's new policy of non-obstruction must be in accordance with this dual principle.

United Press, Washington, 6th - Tokyo's announcement that Kurusu will fly to Washington to strive to prevent the deterioration of the Pacific situation has caused satisfaction among people throughout the city. Washington generally has a deep impression of Kurusu's background and the general atmosphere of his mission, considering it a peaceful move. It is generally believed that Japan is extremely eager for a peaceful resolution of the Pacific unrest. Reliable sources say that although the policy of strife is not consistent with the plan proposed by yesterday's Japan Times editorial, there is no desire for war here, only insistence on maintaining the status quo. Secretary of State Hull said that he did not know whether Kurusu was carrying new proposals. When asked if he thought Kurusu's trip was a hopeful sign, Hull replied that he had nothing to say.

### The Elements of Peace and War Can Be Considered as Fifty-Fifty

Reuters, London, 6th - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the Japanese government's decision to send former Japanese Ambassador to Germany Kurusu to Washington as a special advisor to the ongoing US-Japan talks shows the Japanese side's emphasis on these negotiations. The US-Japan talks were previously in a dilemma, but were resumed by Tojo. Kurusu's mission to the US can be seen as the Japanese government's final effort to break the deadlock in the talks. Therefore, the success or failure of Kurusu's mission is related to the extremely important issue of the Far East. It is no exaggeration to say that the elements of peace and war are fifty-fifty. Regarding the Japanese government's attitude, there has been no official criticism. What is noteworthy is that the special envoy was dispatched by Tokyo on its own initiative. On the other hand, the Japan Times, the mouthpiece of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, has published several points, saying that they are the basis for Japanese demands. If the points published by the newspaper are accurate and truly represent the Japanese side's so-called presentation of the truth of the situation, then it is difficult to see any hope of reconciliation, as they would involve the ABCD powers abandoning their policies being pursued in the Far East. From this point of view, the Japan Times may only be making a probe rather than publishing responsible opinions.

United Press, Tokyo, 6th - Tokyo's Japanese newspapers today adopted a more moderate tone in their editorials regarding the US and Britain, due to the Foreign Ministry's request to the newspapers during Kurusu's mission to Washington. The Japanese newspapers generally mentioned Kurusu's trip briefly on the front page. It is generally believed that his mission is Japan's last effort to break the current deadlock with the US. The Asahi Shimbun published dispatches from London and Melbourne in the most prominent position, saying that Britain, Australia, and New Zealand have secretly planned a "Pacific Offensive." The first article of the Nichinichi Shimbun was a special dispatch from Manila, saying, "The United States does not value negotiations, is strengthening its anti-Japanese front, and is conducting a hypothetical war against Japan." Although the Foreign Ministry asked the newspapers to adopt a more moderate tone during Kurusu's mission to America, the Nichinichi Shimbun was not the only newspaper to attack the US. The newspaper said that the US is trying to prolong the negotiations only to buy time to complete its defenses in the Pacific and Atlantic.

Reuters, London, Day-Hole - Although people generally believe that the hope of an agreement between the US and Japanese governments is slim, and even the so-called "Pacific standstill compromise" may not be achieved, well-informed sources here believe that Japan's special dispatch of Kurusu to Washington indicates that the crisis in the Pacific has at least been delayed somewhat. According to some people's opinions, the Japanese government's official reaction to the sinking of the US ship "Robin James" is a hint that the Japanese government is pursuing a policy of "independence" and is not bound by the Tripartite Pact. The Standard Evening News commented, "Japan did not take action when the German army attacked the Soviet Union, and now it has shown the same retreat when the Germans say that the US has launched an aggression in the Atlantic."

### Duff Cooper Arrives in Sydney to Discuss the Pacific Situation; Dutch East Indies Prepares to Destroy Oil Pools

Reuters, Sydney, 6th - Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's representative in the Far East, arrived here yesterday from Singapore via Batavia and Darwin. He told interviewers that one of his staff was on his way to London, carrying preliminary recommendations for adjusting the work of many British envoys, consuls, and government departments stationed in Far Eastern countries, but this plan cannot be completed without Australian approval. If a Pacific war breaks out, several new organizations must be established, and Australia and New Zealand can also participate as they wish. As for the adjustment of the war, it is not part of his investigation, but is the task of General Brooke-Popham, the commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Far East. Cooper also said that it is easier to predict the winning horse in a race than to guess Japan's future actions. It is well known that there will be actions in a race, but Japan may not take any action, and attacking the Burma Road may be one of its actions. Australian Minister for Commerce and Customs Cain welcomed Cooper, saying that Britain has finally recognized the danger of the Pacific situation. Undoubtedly, Cooper's visit to Australia will "remove any doubts we have about the assistance we can expect to receive in the event of an invasion."

He Ye News Agency, New York, 6th - Dutch East Indies Air Force Commander Major General Wo Tham said yesterday that if the Dutch East Indies is threatened by invasion and occupation, it is prepared to destroy all of the country's cities and oil pools. He wrote in "Flying Magazine," "The destruction of every oil pool in the Dutch East Indies is ready." He also said, "Although we cherish Batavia, Passo, and Surabaya, we are prepared to blow them up with landmines rather than let them fall into the hands of the enemy." Major General Wo Tham said that the Dutch East Indies has set up "traps" into which invaders will fall and be impaled on bamboo stakes. There are also secret air force bases that cannot be seen from the air. He also said that the Dutch East Indies procurement mission is prepared to resell aircraft and exhibition items worth 500 million US dollars to the US, but Britain and the Soviet Union have obtained priority. He also said that if the US can still allow the Dutch East Indies to obtain urgently needed aircraft, it may be able to prevent a war from breaking out in the South Pacific. He also said that two bombers have already arrived there across the Pacific, and more aircraft will fly from Honolulu to the Dutch East Indies next year.

### Japanese Ship Sinks After Hitting a Mine Off the Coast of Korea and Northeast China; Tokyo Announces 17 Deaths, Has Lodged a Serious Protest with the Soviet Union

Reuters, Tokyo, 6th - The Japanese ship Kibi Maru (4,522 tons) was sunk by a floating mine last night off the coast of northeastern Korea. It is reported that all 150 people on board were rescued. According to the Jiji Press, it is widely believed that the mine belonged to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the Japanese government lodged a protest with the Soviet ambassador to Japan this afternoon. On September 1, a Japanese ship sank after hitting a floating mine in the Sea of Japan. On the 10th of that month, another Japanese ship was damaged after hitting a floating mine, and nine Korean fishermen died. The Japanese government has therefore lodged a serious protest with the Soviet Union. Seventeen people have died since the ship accident.

Lubian, Tokyo, 6th - The Governor-General's Office of Korea announced today that since the beginning of this year, a total of 59 drifting Soviet mines have been picked up in the Sea of Japan off the coast of Korea, and it is believed that countless more are still drifting. Japanese ships and fishing boats have hit mines five times in two months, resulting in 16 deaths and 3 injuries. The Kibi Maru tragedy last night has not yet been included. Although the rumor that all passengers and crew members were rescued after the ship sank has not been confirmed, officials admit that if there is no loss of life, the seriousness of the matter will be reduced.

### Kurusu's Flight to America and US-Japan Relations

The Japanese government yesterday dispatched Kurusu, the former Japanese ambassador to Germany, on an urgent flight to America to assist Nomura, the current Japanese ambassador to the United States, in diplomatic contact with the US authorities. At the same time, the Japan Times, claiming to represent the views of the Foreign Ministry, also made a statement to the United States in an editorial, proposing seven principles. From this, it is clear that despite the Japanese military's recent frequent and inflammatory rhetoric, and despite the frequent deployment of Japanese troops along the northern and southern lines, the Tojo Cabinet will still make full use of attempts to entice the United States, while the anxious mood on the Tokyo side and the steady and strong attitude on the Washington side form a stark contrast. The core question at present is whether Japan can ultimately change the attitude of the United States to facilitate Japan's advance to the south, north or west. Answering this question necessarily relates to the fundamental position of American diplomacy, especially the fundamental position of American foreign policy towards the Far East.

The fundamental position of American diplomacy can be summarized into two points: First, in terms of nationality, the United States advocates that every country should have the freedom to survive, that is, its territory and sovereignty should not be subject to external interference or manipulation. Second, in a comprehensive sense, the United States advocates freedom of commerce and transportation, respects treaties, and supports mutual equality and genuine cooperation among nations, while opposing the abuse of force to create unfair hegemony. Earlier examples include President Wilson's initiation of the League of Nations, and more recently, President Roosevelt's joint publication of the Eight-Point Declaration with the British Prime Minister, both of which are consistent expressions based on the aforementioned position. In the Far East, there is also a more concrete Nine-Power Treaty as a guideline for all judgments and actions. Therefore, the United States has no inherent animosity towards Japan. The United States stands on the aforementioned position and takes the Nine-Power Treaty as a guideline to evaluate everything in US-Japan relations. The evolution of US-Japan relations to the present dangerous state can all be said to be determined by facts. These facts are all objective, not subjective. If these objective facts are not eliminated, US-Japan relations cannot be improved; if these objective facts increase, US-Japan relations will naturally deteriorate further.

Generally speaking, Japan's disappointment with the United States mainly lies in three aspects: First, in the political aspect, on October 6, 1937, the second day after the US President delivered a speech in Chicago condemning the aggressor countries, the US government formally stated that "the United States has had to recognize that Japan's actions in China are inconsistent with the principles of international relations and are far from complying with the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact." This constitutes a fundamental difference between the US and Japan. On December 31 of the same year, the United States also notified Japan that it completely denied the so-called "New Order in East Asia." Second, in the economic aspect, before the enactment of the Lend-Lease Act in March of this year, the United States had decided to provide China with huge loans six times (that is, 25 million US dollars in December 1938, 12.8 million US dollars in March 1939, another 15 million US dollars, 20 million US dollars in April 1940, 25 million US dollars in September, and 100 million US dollars in November). After the enactment of the Lend-Lease Act, it further integrated economic aid to China with political and military aid; but for Japan, the United States abolished the US-Japan Commercial Treaty in July 1939, and in July of last year, it began to strictly implement oil and iron embargoes against Japan. In July of this year, it further joined forces with Britain and the Netherlands to freeze all Japanese funds. Third, in the military aspect, the United States is joining hands with Britain and the Netherlands to complete the joint defense of the South Pacific, and established the Far East Military Headquarters in the Philippines in July of this year. On the other hand, it sent a military delegation to Chongqing last month to strengthen cooperation between the US and China based on the Lend-Lease Act. Japan is full of resentment and disappointment with all of the above.

However, Japan seems to have done little to explore or reflect on all the background that led to US actions. If we investigate the actual situation, every new action of the United States has a related action on the Japanese side that precedes it. For example, the US government's statement condemning Japan's violation of treaties was announced after the Japanese army launched its war against China; the US's abandonment of the commercial treaty was announced after Japan closed the Yangtze River and disturbed the concessions; the US's strengthening of oil and iron embargoes against Japan and freezing funds was implemented after Japan launched its southward advance and invaded Vietnam; and the increasing depth and breadth of US aid to China are also closely linked to the driving force from the Japanese side. Now that the Japanese government is aware of the seriousness of the crisis and is eager to change the attitude of the United States, but if we look at the seven principles listed by the Japan Times, and at the statement made by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo at the Privy Council meeting the day before yesterday, saying that Japan will never change its established national policy of establishing the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and at the active actions of Japanese army and navy personnel, it can be said that nothing is far removed from the fundamental position of the United States. If this continues, the future of US-Japan relations will inevitably fall into an unavoidable ending. What good will Kurusu's flight to America do?

### Moscow Foreign Dispatch: German Fierce Offensive Halted, Heavy Fighting in the Tula Region, Germans Announce Arrival at the Outskirts of Sevastopol in Crimea

Reuters, Moscow, 6th - While the German army's new offensive against Moscow continues, fierce fighting is also reported in the Donets Basin. It is heard that Soviet forces have established new positions further east. There is no news about German advances in Crimea or Rostov. The defense lines around Moscow, starting from Kalinin, a hundred miles northwest of the Soviet capital, to Tula, a hundred miles south, have been met with heroic and strong resistance from Soviet forces. In several places, Soviet counter-attacks have been successful, driving German troops out of several towns, especially in the Mozhaisk region of the central Moscow front, where the Germans have now adopted a defensive posture. South of Moscow, in the Tula region, German forces have made no progress, having been stalled in the area for over a week.

United Press, 6th - Schiff reports from (location unclear). Vyshinsky declared here yesterday that Hitler's troops were bogged down at the entrance to Moscow in an historically rare fierce battle. Vyshinsky stated, "The German army began a decisive battle two days ago, but was blocked by Soviet forces everywhere." Vyshinsky continued, "There is fierce fighting along the entire central front, in the areas of Tula, Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk, and Maloyaroslavets. But the German army is unable to advance in any area." He added, "Initially, they attempted to attack Moscow from Maloyaroslavets, then changed to Volokolamsk, but were both blocked. They are currently concentrating on the Tula region, but there is still fierce fighting in all areas."

Reuters, London, 6th - Moscow Radio announced early this morning that Soviet forces are still fighting hard in all areas of Moscow, their courage undiminished. The defenders of the key southern point of Tula destroyed German tanks with hand grenades and fuel bottles as they approached the town. Fourteen German tanks have been destroyed in the area in recent days. A cavalry detachment is currently operating behind German lines. The men, women, and children of Tula are transporting the wounded under fire, showing... (sentence incomplete)

Reuters, London, 6th - Moscow Radio broadcast last night that Red Army units are advancing in one area of the Donets River basin. German troops are retreating, leaving piles of corpses and abandoning many artillery pieces. German forces throughout the Donets Basin have suffered heavy losses. Fighting on the Moscow front continues in Tula (110 miles south of the Soviet capital). The Red Army is launching fierce attacks, inflicting heavy losses on enemy manpower and machinery, forcing them to halt their offensive. The latest Soviet communique, issued at midnight, stated that on November 5, Soviet forces engaged the enemy along the entire line. On Tuesday, Soviet Air Force destroyed 80 enemy tanks and 350 motor vehicles carrying infantry and ammunition, 30 fuel trucks, 13 artillery pieces, and 7 field artillery batteries. A supplementary report stated that between November 2nd and 4th, Soviet land and air forces operating on the central front destroyed 96 enemy tanks, 18 field artillery pieces, several fuel trucks, many trucks carrying infantry and ammunition, and over a battalion of enemy infantry. On November 4th, 30 German aircraft were shot down, and 11 Soviet aircraft were lost. Yesterday, 27 enemy aircraft were shot down near Moscow.

Reuters, Kuibyshev, 4th (Delayed) - Regarding the Crimean campaign, the latest news received here states that the German side has deployed another division of tanks to assist in the battle. The Soviet forces, outnumbered, were forced to hold new positions. The enemy has occupied several locations. Another report states that the German army launched an offensive in Crimea, suffering 50,000 casualties in the past twelve days. The German side used the 173rd Mobile Infantry Division in an attempt to flank the Soviet forces, which failed. The Soviet army launched a fierce counter-offensive, but the German forces are increasing, attempting to expand their breakthrough point and penetrate deep into the Soviet defense lines.

TASS, Moscow, 6th - Large enemy forces are concentrating in the Volokolamsk area. Our army decided to strike first before the enemy completed preparations. The Rukossovsky unit, under the cover of artillery, first attacked the German army, inflicting heavy damage. On the Mozhaisk highway, large enemy tank forces posed a great threat to our army. Fortunately, our reinforcements arrived in time, and the enemy's offensive was blocked. In the Kalinin area, several German divisions again crossed the Volga River, but after fierce fighting, the Germans suffered heavy losses.

Soviet Central Front Reinforcements Counter-attack at Five Key Points

TASS, Moscow, 6th - Red Star correspondent Bai reports from the central front that a Red Army reinforcement division led by Khlamyshev has arrived at the Moscow front to fight, shattering enemy rumors that Soviet reserve forces have been exhausted. The division marched 30 kilometers in heavy rain and immediately joined the battle upon arrival. Their mission was to stop the German advance on the Mozhaisk highway. After fighting the German 7th Division, the reinforcement division advanced several kilometers and recaptured five key crossroads. Our army killed over a thousand enemies and occupied the command post of the 19th Regiment of the German 7th Division. Spoils of war included 18 artillery pieces, 11 anti-aircraft guns, and a large quantity of ammunition.

Soviet Guerrillas Active on German Rear Transportation Lines

Reuters, Moscow, 6th - A supplementary report from the Soviet side states that Soviet guerrillas are now heavily damaging enemy forces, cutting their transportation and destroying enemy tanks, trucks, and ammunition. The enemy has been forced to deploy large forces to protect their rear, as revealed in an order issued by the German 11th Army. The order states, "Guerrillas are active at night before dawn, when vigilance is reduced, launching surprise attacks from ambush on sentries, supply trains, and suddenly strafing aircraft landing or taking off near airfields. They also kill horses pulling artillery to obstruct the movement of artillery units, and then attack." The supplementary report also states that German control of Italy has further aroused the Italian people's hatred for Mussolini's policies. This hatred is often expressed in strike waves. On October 28, 18 miners in Ostia, Italy, destroyed the police headquarters, killed 8 policemen, and held demonstrations with the slogans "Down with the war! Down with Germany!" Workers in the cities of Biella and Crozon, Italy, also clashed with police.

### Review of the Newly Defined and Undefined Borders Between Yunnan, China, and Burma

— Tan Lian

Yunnan's internal border with Burma has two sections: the northern undefined section and the southern undefined section. After the efforts of the border demarcation commission, both sides, in a spirit of harmony and compromise, negotiated and reached an agreement, which was announced on June 18th this year through an exchange of notes between China and the UK, becoming a defined border.

The border that has now been demarcated... Some say it is the yellow line of Liu Zhen (and) Dao (Can); some say it is the purple level shown by the headquarters; now, according to the original text published in the newspapers, examining its longitude and latitude, it is similar to the blue line of Liu Chen (and) Rang; the distance between the yellow and purple lines is too (large), and it is not very related to the border that has now been demarcated. In the new border line, places such as Ban Hong, Meng Jiao, Meng Dong (now Cangyuan County), Meng Ga, Gong Nong, Gong Yong—·Xiao Meng Nong, Yong Bang Ximeng, Yong Guang, and Meng Suo have been assigned to our country. However, there is also a considerable amount of land in the Yeka area west of the central section that has been assigned to Burma; the eleven Zhaohua families. Shaoxing, Shaoba, Upper and Lower Kunma, are all famous Yeka areas. Therefore, this demarcation, rather than being a major achievement of wartime diplomacy, is more accurately described as a slight improvement over previous diplomacy.

The southern border line has not been demarcated for a long time because of the dispute over Gongming Mountain and Kongming Mountain. The location of Gongming Mountain, in recent publications from various places, is mostly based on the five-color border line map of the undefined southern Yunnan-Burma border, at 99 degrees 2 minutes east longitude. According to the Sino-British Agreement on the Yunnan-Burma Border Affairs, the Burmese clause states that Gongming Mountain is located at 23 degrees north latitude and 99 degrees 40 minutes east longitude. (Hua Qiyun's article on the current situation of border demarcation in the Yunnan-Burma section states that Gongming Mountain is located at 23 degrees north latitude and 99 degrees east longitude). The only maps that match the border are the Yunnan-Burma border map signed and sealed by Minister Xue (Fucheng) in London during the border negotiations, and the New Map of the Republic of China compiled by Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, and Zeng Shiying (Gongming Mountain is located at 99 degrees 30 minutes east longitude and is not far from the Yunnan-Burma border map). Apart from these two types of maps, not to mention others, even the New Map of China's Provinces compiled by the same editor is inconsistent. The author compiled a middle school textbook on national geography, making the same mistake. At that time, I privately thought that the further west Gongming Mountain was drawn, the less land would be lost; it is better to lose it in than to lose it out. Now that we have to divide the new border line based on longitude and latitude, we feel that the dagger is revealed at the end of the map and we cannot write. Because Gongming Mountain is the main point of the southern border line, the goal of years of contention, no matter how much diplomacy fails, we will never be willing to draw Gongming Mountain outside the border, and the draftsman has no reason to draw Gongming Mountain outside the border. Based on this, we have to change the position to seek reasonability; the one who holds the pen has no power to move mountains, only to move the mountains on paper to 99 degrees 40 minutes. Unexpectedly, there is already a pocket map on the market, and the new border line has been drawn, unexpectedly drawing Gongming Mountain outside the border, which seems very inappropriate; this matter is of international nature, and the discrepancy is very large. I deeply hope that geographers across the country will jointly study and correct it, and make it the standard for geographical education.

The northern undefined border is attracting attention because of the Pianma and Jiangxinpo incidents. Now that there is no final decision and no demarcation work has been done, it is slightly different in nature from the southern undefined border, and it is possible to learn from the previous border negotiations and mend the fold after the sheep are lost. In the past, the Tibet section of the border line was also due to the dispute over Gaolianggong Mountain and Gaoligong Mountain, which is seemingly similar to the dispute over Gongming Mountain and Kongming Mountain in the south. In fact, Gongming Mountain can be used as a key point for demarcation, but the importance of Gaolianggong Mountain cannot be compared to Gongming Mountain. Old books and new maps do not have reliable sources. The Great Qing Unified Records say: Gaoligong Mountain is also known as Pan Mountain, which is mispronounced as Gaolianggong Mountain in the Yi language; the spring at the top of the mountain is very clear, and its springs flow east into Yongchang and west into (unclear), and also serve as a watershed. According to this, one mountain name is still one mountain, and the watershed proposed by the British has been found. This is because the old saying that Gaolianggong Mountain is not sufficient to be used as a point of negotiation. Reading the New Map of the Republic of China, Gaolianggong Mountain is a slanted terrain, not a north-south longitudinal terrain, and its northeast is connected to the Gaoligong Mountain range, like a branch of Gaoligong Mountain, which is not sufficient to be a natural border mountain; the so-called Bala Mountain in the north is not high enough to be a standard for demarcation, and therefore cannot be used as powerful evidence for negotiation; if we want to dispute with others based on this point, our own foothold will not be stable, and how can we have good results?

### Full Text of Radio Speech Commemorating the Soviet October Revolution: Victory in the Anti-Hitler War Lies in the United Unity of Democratic Countries

TASS, Moscow, 5th - Today is the 24th anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution. Moscow Radio broadcast to the country, with the original text as follows: "The Soviet people are welcoming the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution amidst the flames of war. A life-and-death war is underway. The brutal Hitler is attempting to seize everything that the Soviet people have personally built, intending to enslave the Soviet people and force them to surrender to the fascists. The enemy is pouring all its strength and strategic operations. The world war has indeed spread to the entire world. The problem to be solved on such a vast front is whether humanity will move forward or return to the dark ages of ancient times. The question is whether humanity has sufficient strength to overcome all temptations and trials and be saved from the despicable enemy and the brown plague. Hitler's imperialists have destroyed the peace of countries around the world, plunging Germany, Europe, and the Soviet Union into the vortex of war. Currently, all freedom-loving people are waging an anti-Hitler war under the leadership of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is bearing the brunt of the attack. The Soviet people are facing the greatest test, but even so, during this difficult period, we firmly believe that the enemy will be crushed, and only a few remnants will remain. The day when our army seizes victory and destroys the fascist bandits will surely come. But then, during the trial period, can we say victory? But we can and must say so. Every year on the anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet people always look back on the past and plan for the future. The Soviet people are now planning for the future steps to destroy the enemy and achieve final victory. Our resistance is increasing and will continue to increase. The enemy's path is filled with piles of enemy corpses. Hitler's military strength is weakening. His entire war machine is facing a serious state of tension. All his reserve forces have entered the war. The Eastern Front, although not the only front, is certainly the decisive front. Our reasons for fighting are supported by Britain, the United States, and other countries. Our strength has been increasing day by day with the help of freedom-loving people. Hitler has never encountered such a major setback as that given to him by the Red Army. It is clear that Germany has had to engage in a protracted war. Germany's temporary victory cannot avoid the inevitable historical recurrence. Hitler will never be able to resist the enormous power of the anti-fascist united front. Although Hitler has conquered several countries, he has not been able to secure a solid foothold. There is an atmosphere of reaction within France. The seeds of the Free French movement have been buried in each occupied area. Poland has been transformed into a concentration camp, but the patriotic movement is spreading within the country. The guerrilla warfare in Yugoslavia is no different from real war. The German side has been forced to send troops to the country to deal with the Cetnik Serbian guerrillas. All the Slavic people have risen up against the German, Italian, and Hungarian occupiers. In addition, hatred for the German occupiers is increasing day by day in the Netherlands and Denmark. The German people are daily witnessing a continuous stream of wounded soldiers, which is the background of Germany's so-called victory. The German people perceive that a protracted war is unavoidable. They will inevitably encounter severe cold, hunger, and all the suffering caused by a protracted war. The German people have been deceived. Their will has been destroyed and they have tasted the suffering of the fascist bandits, but the day of their salvation will surely come, and the German people will unite with the freedom-loving people. The Western Front is currently temporarily silent. All military forces have been driven to the Eastern Front. The fascist forces on the Western Front have no response to the attacks by the British Air Force. Britain is a major participant in the anti-Hitler front. Britain is gathering its strength to prepare for the struggle against Hitlerism in the future. Britain's enormous reserve force is the reserve force of the entire anti-Hitler front, but these reserve forces have not yet fully activated, but the day of activation is rapidly approaching. Hitler will soon feel the combined strength of the Soviet Union, Britain, and other freedom-loving people. The United States is preparing military equipment for us and for the entire anti-Hitler front. Hitler attempted to persuade the United States not to enter the war but has failed. The United States is one of those who are engaged in the war against fascism. The United States is providing military assistance to the Soviet Union, Britain, and all freedom-loving people for the just war against fascism. The attitude taken by the United States shows that they will never change their policy in the struggle against Hitler and will increase their strength in this regard. Hitler's plan to alienate his enemies has completely failed. He is now facing the unity of the three major countries. His plan to use a crusade against Bolshevism has also failed. Given his position, he can no longer implement a strategy of conquering enemies one by one. Therefore, he is now facing the situation of having to fight on two or more fronts. This is the reason why he is trying to achieve victory on the Eastern Front and hopes to defeat the Soviet Union, although this can never happen. The Soviet Union will never stop the old fight. Hitler will never be able to crush the resistance of the Soviet people. The Soviet people have a spirit of non-sacrifice and sufficient strength and determination. They can certainly continue to fight. The Soviet people are united and united as never before. They resolutely and courageously follow Stalin's banner and advance, firmly believing that they will eventually defeat fascism. They understand that victory must be obtained through the united strength of all freedom-loving people. The war will be prolonged, and there will be more hardships in the future, but we are getting closer to victory day by day. The enemy will be crushed, and victory will belong to us."

### Litvinov's Comeback: Replaces Umansky as Ambassador to the United States

United Press, Kuibyshev, 6th - Former Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov has been appointed by the government today as Ambassador to the United States, replacing Konstantin Umansky, who recently left Washington, D.C., with the American delegation to the Soviet Union, flying to London. Litvinov's comeback is sufficient to show the Soviet Union's renewed trust in this talented diplomat. It is noted that Litvinov resigned from his position as Foreign Minister in May 1939, largely due to dissatisfaction with the German-Soviet Pact, largely because of the widely circulated rumor that senior German officials, because Litvinov was a Jew, were unwilling to talk and have contact with him.

Reuters, Washington, 6th - According to diplomatic sources, Litvinov has been selected to (replace) Umansky (as) Soviet Ambassador to the United States. Umansky is now (in) (relation unclear).

### Rice Shortage in the Bureau, Rice Weevils Relentlessly Stirring Up Price Hikes, Another 38,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai

Since the market authority repeatedly advised the rice market to conduct transactions in accordance with regulations, speculation disappeared and prices stabilized slightly. Then, people became anxious and sold off their holdings, leading to a sharp drop in prices. Unexpectedly, yesterday, prices suddenly rebounded. This was because local shops' actual sales, due to the Municipal Council's price-controlled rice supply being intermittent and insufficient to meet the needs of retail outlets. Other goods were also affected by the previous rice price hikes, discouraging merchants from stocking up. To cope with the situation, they unanimously took advantage of the low prices to replenish their inventories, leading to a surge in buying interest. However, sellers, seeing that speculation was not active and wary of the lingering impact of the sharp price drop the day before yesterday, had no intention of raising prices, so quotations remained relatively stable in the morning, with little change in prices. Later, as actual sales continued to be strong, large merchants became enthusiastic and suddenly began to absorb supplies. Speculators and others also regained confidence and blindly followed suit, causing a sudden change in the overall market situation. Rumors spread again throughout the market, and quotations rose sharply. The price of No. 1 Saigon high-quality rice soared from 190 yuan to 195.5 yuan, No. 2 from 175-176 yuan to 183 yuan, No. 1 from afar from 185 yuan to 190 yuan, No. 2 from an opening price of 170 yuan to 177 yuan, Zhongguan mindang from 172 yuan to 178 yuan, Huojiao Zhongguan opened at 183.5 yuan, high-quality rice at 190 yuan, Zhahua jian from 187-188 yuan to 192 yuan, Xiaojiao from 158-159 yuan to 165-166 yuan, and Suijian from 135-136 yuan to 140 yuan, a sudden increase of five, six, or seven yuan compared to the previous market. In short, the market remains inactive, and when it becomes active, it is like a storm, advancing by leaps and bounds, and it is unknown where it will end. This only fattens the bellies of rice merchants and starves the bellies of the common people, who can only afford price-controlled rice and eat rice stalks.

The arrival of abundant supplies of thick and thin japonica rice has boosted the market, and due to the high difference in price, although foreign rice is becoming scarce, public sentiment remains calm. Kai Nan Gang broke 103 yuan early, settling at 201 yuan. Kunshan new japonica rice was 202-203 yuan, special grade 205-206 yuan, Qingjiao kiln type 203 yuan to 200 yuan, wild rice 206 yuan, and original package Dujian (with bag) 204 yuan.

Due to the rise in foreign rice prices, the path of glutinous rice has turned, and the intention of cargo owners to sell has become stronger, and price increases are difficult, so as a result, both domestic and foreign glutinous rice prices have increased by one or two yuan. Kai Hong Kong Baiyuan Gao was 220 yuan, settling at 117-118 yuan, Nuolu was 204-205 yuan, settling at 200 yuan, and Yu Dan Guo (yuan) 208-209 yuan.

The black market in foreign flour was also stimulated by rising gold and rice prices. Holders of goods are hoarding, and new hoarding customers are making a comeback, so the opening price in the Pao Tai district was 60 yuan, followed by 60 yuan and two cents, and Jinlong opened at 56 yuan, followed by an increase of half a yuan to a yuan to 57.5 yuan, all higher than the previous market price, but the price of bran, when hoarders came out of the woodwork, was down one yuan. Small packages opened at 58 yuan.

Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrive Continuously at the Port: Jardine Matheson and Washeng transported 7,100 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon, which is the Municipal Council's price-controlled rice, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Also, Yilong Company's Shen'ai Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, transporting 31,000 bags of foreign rice directly from Yangon, which was purchased by Dafu Foreign Firm in this city, and docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

### Soybean Oil Black Market Soars

Yesterday, the black market in miscellaneous grains was boosted by the rise in gold prices, and cargo owners began to raise prices again, so the market situation once again became激昂 (Excited and vigorous). It is heard that Dalian soybean oil has been sold for 395 yuan, Jiangbei bucket raw oil 390 yuan, (Fork) soybean oil 370 yuan, Yoshida factory vegetable oil 270 yuan, Rihua factory vegetable oil 268 yuan, Changzhou niupi huang 110 yuan, Yangzhou Xinsheng ren 176 yuan, (He Lan) yellow corn 50 yuan and five cents to yuan, and white corn 49 yuan, Saigon new corn 63.5 yuan, and October shipment 95 yuan to 97 yuan, and November shipment 98 yuan.

### Public Association Resumes Afternoon Trading: Cash Transactions, Market Prices Surge Over 1,200 Units

Yesterday, the black market for spot silver surged again. Due to the lack of a centralized trading location for dealers, market prices were easily manipulated and driven up by a few sellers. Exchange merchants aggressively bid up by over one hundred taels, pushing prices to 1,200 to 1,300 yuan, breaking through the 21,000 yuan mark. Consequently, the Lianyi Public Association agreed to the brokers' request to resume cash trading within the exchange starting in the afternoon. The association would dispatch personnel to monitor and prevent excessive price hikes, and would be responsible for cash settlements, charging a commission of five yuan per bar, along with an income tax of three jiao. As a result, market prices, maintained by Xianghe, Tianyuan, and cash dealers through sales, were pushed down from 21,900 yuan to a low of 20,950 yuan, which was absorbed by securities firms Defu and Mingfeng. The prices then rose again, ultimately seeing a gain of 1,210 yuan. The total daily trading volume was over 5,000 taels. Gold ornaments rose by 110 yuan, reaching 2,170 yuan. The black market price for silver taels was also pushed up to 32 yuan.

Cash Dealers Continue to Absorb

The initial price for each bar (ten taels) of spot silver was 20,400 yuan in the morning, quickly rising by 200 yuan, but there were no buyers. It continued to rise to 650 yuan before two gold shops started trading ten taels with each other. A money shop inquired via telephone to bid. Exchange merchants absorbed on behalf of "a certain firm," and cash dealers re-entered the market, driving the price up by 1,000 yuan, with 30 taels traded at 21,500 yuan. At noon, it was 21,400 yuan. In the afternoon, trading resumed at the Lianyi Public Association, with the price pushed up by 350 yuan. The opening price was 21,750 yuan. Yongcheng and Chengda bought in, and the price rose again to 21,900 yuan. Soon, Tianyuan, Xianghe, Yifeng, Shunyuan, Shihe, Hengji, and Xiangxing all began selling off, causing the market price to immediately drop by 950 yuan, falling to 10,950 yuan. Tianyuan re-entered, and Chengji and Deda also bought, raising it by 600 yuan to 21,550 yuan. Xianghe and Defu then sold aggressively, dropping it to 21,150 yuan. Mingfeng, Xiangxing, Yongde, and Defu re-entered, with Chengda buying up to 21,500 yuan. The market closed at 4 PM at 21,410 yuan, a rebound of 1,210 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, with a daily fluctuation of 1,500 yuan. The retail price of cash dealers' standard gold was 21,600 yuan, with a buy-back price reduced by about 1,000 yuan.

Sudden Increase of 110 Yuan in Jewelry Gold

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops, both Datongxing and Xintongxing, increased three times in the morning, for a total increase of 110 yuan, to 2,170 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon. The buy-back price was reduced by 150 yuan.

### Black Market Exchange Rate Loosens: Foreign Currencies Regain Strength and Price

Yesterday’s foreign exchange market saw HSBC and the Central Bank maintain their listed rates. Small counters at HSBC and other banks kept their prices unchanged. The black market rates for British and American currencies showed a slight easing. Hong Kong and Taiwan offered US dollars at 2.875 yuan, but although there was only 1.2 million yuan available, buyers were bidding above 3 yuan. A Chinese broker in New York offered between 30,000 and 50,000 US dollars in telegraphic transfers for trading in New York, but there were no takers at 3 yuan. British pounds were offered at 1 1/8.75, indicating the market was not as tight as in previous days. The situation stabilized in the afternoon, with the closing rates at 4 PM at 2 shillings for British pounds and 3 yuan for US dollars, both considered difficult to settle and sell, with a slight easing compared to the previous day, and成交 still sparse.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds each rise by 20 yuan along with the cash silver price. British gold notes also rebounded by 3 yuan, and American gold notes re-emerged above the 40 yuan mark, briefly reaching 40.7 yuan, before finally settling at 40.3 yuan, a gain of 1 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes recovered their upward trend, retreating to 9.3 yuan in the evening market. Japanese gold notes remained stable, holding steady at 3.9 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes continued to rise, reaching 3.8 yuan in the evening market.

### Mill Yarn Released: Yarn Market Still Rising

The yarn market turned upward, and sentiment improved again. This was due to the decline in the gold rush having subsided, and raw cotton being difficult to loosen, allowing buyers to be active, so the market is prosperous. The opening price of the 20-count Double Horse mill's single shift yarn rose because of the rebound of the futures yarn market in the afternoon of the previous day, and the rising of the leading cloth. Therefore, floating positions were covered, and bullish activity increased. Everyone on the floor was calling to buy, and the first transaction was at 3,160 yuan, an increase of 80 yuan compared to the previous day. Afterwards, buyers were still enthusiastic, and continued to rise to 3,210 yuan, but profit-takers sold off, and short-sellers increased, and the籌碼 felt loose, and gradually declined to 3,105 units. Major players came back to buy at low prices, and rebounded to 3,150 yuan at the close. Shenxin No. 9 Mill released 1,550 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn, priced at 3,120 yuan, currently for sale by dealers.

The spot yarn situation followed the rebound, but buying interest was not as tight as in the past. Although the market price rose by about 100 yuan, the price increase of the 20-count medium goods was relatively thin, due to profit-takers selling off. According to statistics, the volume of transactions during the day was 560 bales.

The futures market for all Double Horse yarn was volatile, and the trend gradually became chaotic. Because of the surge in the market, new peaks emerged endlessly. Although there were still strong buyers, they were inevitably more cautious due to the high prices. General speculators pushed up the market, and many took profits. Therefore, the market fluctuated suddenly, already showing signs of disorder. When the market initially opened in the morning, the trend was extremely strong. Bullish investors rushed in, and there were very few sellers on the floor. The November contract opened at 3,045 yuan, a surge of 165 yuan. Afterwards, the price rose, reaching as high as 3,060 yuan. The December contract opened at 3,220 yuan, the highest price, also a surge of more than 150 yuan. The January contract opened at 3,250 yuan, the same as the previous day's settlement price. Although it also rose to 3,270 yuan at one point, it then fell back. By the noon close, all contracts had fallen back by 30 to 50 yuan. In the afternoon, the market became slightly tired due to the strong gold market, and sentiment weakened slightly. Floating longs sold off one after another, and all monthly contracts fell back in succession. As a result of the ups and downs throughout the day, the November and December contracts rose due to lack of transactions on the previous day's competitive board, while the January contract fell back by 72 yuan. The details are listed in the table below.

### American and Indian Cotton Arrive in Shanghai in Succession

American and Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai together. The Virginia (S.S. Virginia), managed by the British firm Jardine, Matheson & Co., transported over 5,500 bales of cotton from South American ports to Shanghai, as previously reported. It is now known that the ship arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Gonghe Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. In addition, the Jardine Matheson's Hesheng vessel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying a large quantity of foreign rice from Hong Kong, as well as 6,704 pieces of cotton. The cotton was produced in India and transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, docking at the Ruisi Fu wharf for unloading.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to Southern hedging and sales in New Orleans, but later rose due to short covering and industry buying, resulting in a closing price about three or four pounds higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market saw very active trading in recent days due to the sharp rise in gold prices and the Indian government's decision to increase the production capacity of yarn factories. Industry buyers, short covering, and European exporters all contributed. Yesterday's closing prices rose by eight or nine rupees across the board. The opening market today is expected to rise by 0.25 rupees.

The current cotton situation remains firm. The strength of coarse cotton has only increased, and fine cotton also has considerable activity, but factory demand has not expanded. However, the industry sentiment is good, because cotton yarn has rebounded.

### Tight Credit: Speculation in Cloth Declines

The trend for mill cloth is weak. Although there are positive stimuli, tight credit and pressure from sellers resulted in weakness. Coarse cloth fell by one to four yuan, fine cloth and twill were flat, colored cloth remained firm. Sales to customers were stagnant, and there were still small purchases in the local market. Trading among dealers also decreased, totaling about 200 pieces.

The price of East Cloth Leading Fine Cloth Mill's single shifted in the morning due to the rebound in cash silver, with floating long positions pushing it up to around 131.10 yuan. But then, due to soft sentiment among dealers, they sold off at high prices, and the market atmosphere suddenly declined. The midday price was 125 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose again to 127 yuan, but finally, due to the disappearance of actual sales, it fell to 124.25 yuan at the close. And mid-range fine cloth and fine twill continued to fall by one or two yuan. Sijunzi Biqi closed in the evening at 4.14 yuan, a drop of three cents.

The woolen market remains tight. The market prices of most popular Western suits are firm and rising. Most are unwilling to open for wholesale. Common goods with no bright patterns, such as plain-colored Yiwei flannel, Four Seasons flannel, plain-colored Chongshi Bubbletex, cashmere overcoat, Huate flannel, medium-thick Biqi, and Hailingbang, are actively sold. The Western suit makers in Hongkou have even greater demand, because most of the Western suit tailors in Hongkou do business with the Japanese. In order to cater to the tastes of their customers, they require a lot of black plain goods. Soft, non-durable cashmere overcoats are completely promoted by this group.

### Small Domestic Debt is Not Easy to Get—Large Is Also Difficult

The black market for public debt reversed course yesterday after two days of gains and weakened again. Fortunately, the bulls still had some strength, and most retail investors were still keen on going long, so the market rebounded slightly every few jiao. But every time it rose a few jiao, floating long positions wanted to sell out. Currently, because credit is too tight and interest rates are too high, most trading firms are refusing to accept long positions. The few willing to do so are also demanding very high interest rates, which does not apply to those who take delivery of the goods. Therefore, retail transactions are very volatile and cautious. The current trend is still hesitant and fluctuating, at most just hovering, and it is not yet time for a good rebound. Yesterday morning, Yizhonghong, Dayongkang bought in, and Dahua, Lianhe, and Yuancheng sold out. The market price fluctuated between two or three jiao, and the trend was quite stable. In the afternoon, Senchang and Lemao bought in, while Xiexing, Yuanyizhong, and Tongkang selling put pressure on the market. The supply exceeded demand, and Class C bonds broke through five yuan again. Then, Dingkang and Shuntai added to their long positions, and Yuancheng and Hengkang could not meet the supply, and the price was raised to 5.55 yuan at the close. The bulls and bears competed, and there was still plenty of strength. As a result, market prices all fell back by one or two jiao to three or four jiao and so on. The total transaction volume was about 1.56 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock trading: 500 shares of Huashang Electric were traded, priced at 19.5 yuan.

### Sugar is Also Greedy for Silver and Wants to Control It

The sugar market fell following the decline in gold prices yesterday and the day before. The near-term contract fell by 40 yuan to the limit. The November 10th contract is the last trading day tomorrow. Credit is extremely tight, causing floating longs to sell out. Spot October shipment No. 24 coarse white was 340 yuan to 333 yuan in the morning and 335 yuan to 325 yuan in the afternoon. Dutch red was 279 yuan, and 270 yuan in the afternoon. Hong Kong coarse was 300 yuan to 292 yuan. Today's trading volume in futures was over 25,000 bags, and spot volume was over 17,000 bags.

### Philippine Lumber Judged to Shanghai—Four Million Feet

A large quantity of foreign pine boards and lumber arrived in Shanghai. The Philippine merchant ship SS Folorence. D., managed by Huarun Foreign Company, transported a total of 4 million feet of boards and lumber from Little Luzon, arriving in port yesterday evening and docking at buoys 20 and 21 for unloading. The construction industry in Shanghai has been exceptionally developed recently, and it feels a great lack of materials. With this supply, the market may be slightly stabilized.

### Haifeng Again Adds Demolition Plate

The sales of Haifeng white coal have gradually increased recently. Street customers are starting to buy, but the source is in constant supply, and it is quite涌躍. The dealer managing the coal, seeing an opportunity to take advantage, took advantage of the chaotic market to dismantle the plate and increased it by 70 yuan. Nos. 1 and 2 lumps increased from 750 yuan to 820 yuan, causing retail stores in this street to increase prices one after another. Amidst the decline in gold prices, coal prices continued to rise. Reversing course and acting perversely is truly appalling.

### Metals Refuse to Be Easily Dumped—Market Price Has No Definite Standard

The price of metals has been rising continuously in recent days. The overseas sources are interrupted, and the inventory in Shanghai is thin, which causes the holders to be arrogant and prices to rise continuously. Although the transaction is not as good as it used to be, still unwilling to throw away a large number, the price of each product is quite disordered and without standard.

### Before the Implementation of Price Control: Foreign Merchants Adopt Temporary Measures: Forcing Retail Stores to Set Fair Prices: Importers Organize Temporary Committee: Large Quantities of Foreign Rice and Sugar Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Will Be Sold Publicly Soon

The Shanghai British Association's Executive Committee held its bi-weekly meeting on the 4th at the association's headquarters at No. 27 The Bund, chaired by Mr. Crowther. One of the important agenda items was the issue of price controls. The meeting reported on the organization of the Importers' Association and its members' assistance with the price control plan. The first to be regulated in the future would be the goods of department stores and pharmacies, and it was stated that importers had already organized a temporary committee, with many British Association members participating in the meetings, and several important proposals were being expedited. Importers had undoubtedly provided significant assistance to the price control plan. According to a well-known foreign importer, the work of organizing the Importers' Association was progressing actively and smoothly, and several meetings had already been held with representatives of the Public Works Department, and more would be scheduled. Some foreign importers had already adopted temporary measures to ensure that retail stores sold goods at regulated, reasonable prices.

Foreign Rice Arrives Yesterday: Approximately 40,000 Bags

The continuous arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai has been reported in this newspaper several times.

Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Hesheng vessel arrived in port, carrying 7,100 bags of the Public Works Department's low-priced foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, Yilong Company's Shenai vessel arrived yesterday morning directly from Rangoon, carrying 31,000 bags of foreign rice, docking at the Hongkou Huashun Wharf for unloading. The Rangoon rice on the vessel was purchased by the Shanghai Dafu Foreign Company. Liji Foreign Company has also received PWD foreign rice in recent days. Therefore, most requests from rice merchants to purchase additional foreign rice have been approved. The number approved yesterday reached over 17,000 bags, making the work of Xiangmao Foreign Company, which handles receipts and issues warehouse warrants, exceptionally busy. Yesterday, the foreign company specially notified all rice merchants who make payments that, starting today, they must first obtain a number certificate when making payments and the warehouse warrant will be issued according to the number certificate.

Two Rice Sales Offices to Open Next Week

The Federation of Importers recently established by the Public Works Department has devised effective methods to combat profiteering in the retail industry. An official from the Public Works Department stated the day before yesterday that the Federation would inform the Public Works Department of the price of a certain item it considers reasonable at any time. If the Federation receives the assistance of all importers, it will certainly be able to eliminate profiteering. The official also said that the two rice sales offices established by the Public Works Department will open early next week, selling only the foreign rice purchased by the Bureau, and that such rice sales offices will soon be added. According to well-informed sources, retail unscrupulous merchants, knowing that their end is near, are taking advantage of the fact that officials and major merchants are still discussing the most effective ways to suppress prices, and are wantonly raising prices, hoping to sell off and make a profit. Some people believe that the evil wind of profiteering has reached the final stage of elimination, and the day when exploitation of the public, especially the poor, will end is not far away.

Organizing a Flour Wholesale Association

PWD Announcement No. 5577 yesterday: "Merchants engaged in the wholesale of flour in the Public Concession and the French Concession will meet at 2:00 PM on Monday, the 10th of this month, in the Board Meeting Room of the Bureau's General Office at No. 209 Jiangxi Road. Leading flour wholesalers intend to organize a Flour Wholesale Association at the meeting. If they can order flour at the statutory exchange rate, the Association will raise general funds for the port and the Bureau will purchase and transport it for import. The sale of imported flour will be strictly controlled by the Bureau, and the price will be set by the Bureau. Flour wholesalers in the two concessions who wish to participate in the above meeting must notify the Director-General in writing as soon as possible, no later than 4:00 PM on the 7th of this month."

Sugar Vessel Has Arrived: To Be Sold Next Week

An official from Taikoo Company revealed yesterday morning that a batch of Taikoo sugar that has arrived in Shanghai will be sold early next week. The batch of Taikoo sugar was delayed in arriving in Shanghai because the vessel carrying it was damaged, resulting in a shortage of this sugar at several wholesale stores. However, there are currently about 500,000 pounds of Javanese sugar in the city, most of which is being hoarded in warehouses by large merchants who import it on their own, while Taikoo Company only transports the sugar ordered by merchants, causing it to be held for speculation.

### Unified Class Ding Bonds To Be Drawn On 10th

The National Debt Fund Management Committee, in order to maintain creditworthiness, has been conducting monthly drawings for the 12th redemption of the five types of bonds (A, B, C, D, and E) of the 1936 Unified Public Debt since August. It has now been determined that the bonds will be drawn in Shanghai on the morning of November 10th at 10:00 AM, and the First Special District Court, the Silver and Money Industry Association, etc., have been requested to send personnel to supervise the process. The principal and accrued interest for the bonds drawn will be paid starting on January 31st of next year, and the payment and interest payment methods will be determined and announced by the Ministry of Finance at that time.

### British Association: General Meeting Today: British Leaders Will Give Speeches

Seventeen candidates for the association's new directors for 1942 have been nominated and will be elected at the General Meeting. Election ballots will be distributed on the spot.

### Construction Vessel Chartered: Sailing Directly to Moji

The Construction Dredger, since being leased by the Japanese side, all crew members have been dismissed, and new recruits have been transferred to the ship for training. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 12th of this month and sail to Moji. Because the Japanese side feared other disturbances due to the original crew's opposition to the dismissal, the Construction Dredger was suddenly towed away from the riverside opposite Xinkaihe by a steamship at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday and sailed to the mouth of the Wusong River for docking.

Left Shanghai Last Night

After arriving at Wusong, the Construction Dredger was docked overnight. Yesterday, the entire day was spent transporting coal, fresh water, and other food supplies onto the ship, which was completed in the afternoon, and it set sail directly for Moji at 5:00 PM. In addition to the Norwegian owner, the Japanese first and second mates, and the old crew members, all of the crew from the Russian first mate to the Chinese crew of over 100 people remained in Shanghai, thoroughly upholding the opposition to the transfer.

Crew Seek Orders

According to reports from the Datong News Agency reporter, all the Chinese crew members who were dismissed and remained in Shanghai went to the Public Works Department yesterday to request reassignment and withdrawal of the dismissal order. However, the Bureau did not give a concrete answer, so the crew members did not hand over their uniforms and blankets. As for the Russian first mate, the Bureau has already transferred him to the Li Liang Survey Vessel to serve as the owner.

Bureau Remains Silent

The Datong News Agency reporter visited the person in charge of the Bureau yesterday, but they remained silent on the matter. According to inquiries, the Japanese side still claims that the charter of the ship is for six months. Since the ship was occupied during the Shanghai War, the machinery on board was damaged and much was missing. The Japanese side suddenly returned the ship last year, and the Bureau thoroughly repaired it, spending 2 million yuan. After the repair, it was not used and was suddenly requisitioned and sent to Japan and North China. It is said that the Construction Dredger will dredge the waters south of Haeju, an important Japanese naval base.

### British Intelligence Specialist Stationed In Shanghai Receives Soviet Medal

Haitong News Agency's local special dispatch: According to reliable sources, Alexander, the British intelligence specialist stationed in Shanghai, has been awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor by Chairman Kalinin of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in recognition of his contribution to promoting British-Soviet cooperation.

### Money Shops Operating Without Authorization: Association Will Not Provide Protection: Ordinary Deposits of Approved Money Shops: 20% Reserve Requirement to Be Deposited in the Four Banks

According to the Banking Law of the Ministry of Finance, anyone who accepts deposits, provides loans, discounts bills, handles foreign exchange, or undertakes mortgage businesses must obtain a license before establishing a business. Recently, it has been discovered that some newly established banks, money shops, silver shops, and trust companies in Shanghai have already applied for approval in accordance with the law, but some have opened and started trading without approval, which is inconsistent with national laws and regulations. Institutions operating without approval will be banned in order to maintain the legitimate operations of the silver shops. As for the ordinary deposits of institutions that have been approved for establishment (excluding savings deposits, which should be handled in accordance with the Savings Bank Law), 20% of the total deposits received should be held as reserves and transferred to any of the local four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China), and the receiving bank will provide appropriate interest. It is said that the Silver and Money Industry Association has ordered its members to comply after receiving the order. Silver shops that have been established without approval must not join the industry association as members.

In addition, Jardine Matheson Foreign Company's Hesheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, transporting 6,704 pieces of cotton from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The cotton was produced in India and transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Philippine merchant ship SS Folorence. D., managed by Huarun Foreign Company, transported 4 million feet of boards and lumber from Little Luzon, arriving in port yesterday evening and docking at buoys 20 and 21 for unloading.

Preferential measures have been established to facilitate the transfer of funds from ports to the interior.

### Relief for Internally Relocated Workers in Case of Air Raids

Since factories from Shanghai and other coastal areas have successively relocated to the rear areas, inland industry has shown a booming scene. It is imperative to provide security for workers who have relocated inland with the factories in the event of damage from air raids. The Ministry of Social Affairs, in conjunction with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has specially formulated provisional relief measures for factory and mine workers suffering from air raids, which will be implemented from the first of this month. The Shanghai side has also received them. The measures are excerpted below:

Relief Measures

Article 2: If a worker is injured by bombing, the factory or mine shall bear his medical expenses. Article 3: If a worker is injured by bombing and becomes disabled, resulting in the permanent loss of all or part of his ability to work, the factory or mine shall, in addition to bearing his medical expenses, provide a disability allowance based on the severity of the disability. The amount shall not exceed the average wage of three years at most, and shall not be less than the average wage of one year at least.

However, they still bravely fired their guns at the thugs. After a few steps, they fell due to their injuries, but still sounded the whistle. Their brave and loyal spirit is evident here.

(3) Chinese Constable No. 1268 was injured in his left flank and right hand while on duty at 1768 Avenue Joffre after hearing the victim shout for help while chasing kidnappers. However, he still fired his gun at the thugs and sounded the whistle. He then collapsed to the ground due to physical exhaustion. His bravery and perseverance are exemplary. The following meritorious personnel received bronze medals:

(1) French Inspector Li Aicai (transliteration) heard gunshots nearby while at home and immediately went out with a gun, together with Chinese and Vietnamese police officers, to pursue armed thugs. One gangster was injured and arrested.

(2) Vietnamese Constable No. 397 heard gunshots on Avenue Joffre while patrolling on Route Cohen and saw armed thugs running forward. He fired at them. The thugs returned fire.

The suspicious man took out a weapon and was shot down by the constable. It was found that the thug had sniped Western Detective Chief Lotonon and attempted to escape, but was killed by the Chinese constable. His alertness and composure are evident here.

(6) Chinese Constable No. 39 was on duty on Route Bayle and Route du Père Huc when he suddenly heard several gunshots. Together with a senior Western police officer, he fired at the thugs. One of them was seriously injured and captured.

(7) Chinese Constable No. 1255 was on duty on Route Picon when he suddenly heard several gunshots coming from Avenue Joffre. He ran to the area and saw three thugs running forward. He immediately opened fire and captured one of them on Route du Père Huc. The thug also returned fire at the time.

### Nanslav Steamship "Tomislav" Repainted with Italian Postal Flags: Shipowner Telegraphed, the Other Party Ignored it, but Has Not Registered with the Port Authority

The Yugoslav freighter "Tomislav," anchored in the Huangpu River, was recently seized by Italian troops stationed in Shanghai. Eleven crew members were expelled and stranded ashore. Their clothes and other personal belongings were left on board and occupied by the Italian side. There is now

Various Evidence

To prove that the Italian claim that the ship has been sold to the Italian side and that the Italian flag was raised is unfounded. However, the Italians have eliminated the traces that "Tomislav" is a Yugoslav ship and repainted the Italian postal company flag on the ship's smokestack. The Italian authorities recently used the excuse that the Italian postal company has purchased the ship and occupied it. The captain, Bavorini, has received several telegrams from Europe, one of which was sent by the shipowner, Bozhobanazi, the general manager of the Yugoslav postal company, instructing him not to listen to

Italian Control

Orders from Yugoslavian agencies. According to Bozhobanazi, he has shown these telegrams to the Italian authorities stationed in Shanghai, but the Italian side ignored them, clearly believing that the matter has come to an end. The Italian side has not registered the transfer of the ship with the local port authority or customs in accordance with the law. The crew members are owed a total of 1,800 US dollars in wages, so they have no money and are stranded in Shanghai. It is estimated that the ship has lost more than 30,000 US dollars since it was seized.

Manipulation and Monopoly

Therefore, at 3:30 PM on the 6th, a representative meeting of fellow traders was convened to discuss rectifying market trading rules. Because it took time to organize, it was not announced at that time. It has now been announced to the market to inform fellow traders to abide by it. The original text reads, "For the purpose of notification, the association convened a fellow traders meeting yesterday, and the resolutions were unanimously adopted and must be strictly observed.

Under interrogation, they admitted to the intimidation without hesitation, but they had jointly discussed in advance to go to the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road to

Burn Incense and Pray for a Wish. If they succeeded, they would offer a plaque. Afterwards, they actually obtained 1,500 yuan in legal tender. Believing that the Bodhisattva was effective, they wrote "Responsive to Every Prayer" and the disciples Ding Yirui, Kang Jingliang, Chen Chuntang (at large), Chen Dongsheng, and Chen Yifei jointly donated a plaque to the Hongmiao Temple for hanging. In order to clarify the facts, the police station ordered detectives to go to the Hongmiao Temple to take a photo of the plaque and found out that they had also started writing

Threatening Letters

To Xu Linshan of Rongyang Socks Factory at No. 81 Pinlang Road from May 18th, extorting 40,000 yuan, and also committed two robbery cases. Two fake pistols were confiscated.

### Another Labor Dispute at Hualong Weaving Factory: Caused by the Factory's Repudiation of the Signed Agreement

The Hualong Weaving Factory in this city has hundreds of male and female workers. The factory's production of velvet carpets is sold all over the country and abroad. Recently, due to the customs ban on the export of cotton fabrics, the business has been greatly affected. On the 1st of this month, the factory suddenly changed all female workers to temporary workers. Those who did not want to work could voluntarily resign. Because the female workers had no job security, they negotiated with the factory and agreed to start working from the 4th and restore their original positions. Both parties signed a settlement record as proof. However, on the morning of the 4th, when the female workers entered the factory to work, the factory repudiated the previous agreement and refused the female workers to enter the factory. All the female workers, because the factory broke its promise and was untrustworthy, once again petitioned various parties for relief.

### The French Police Department Announced the Arrest of Two Russian Women Suspected of Espionage Activities. They Have Been Handed Over to the Japanese Authorities for Interrogation.

The English "North China Daily News" reported that according to the news released by the French Concession Police Department this morning (6th), two Russian women are suspected of knowing about espionage activities in this city and have now been detained by the Japanese military police for interrogation. It is said that these two Russian women were arrested by the French Police Department and handed over to the Japanese authorities. One of the women is the widow of the Russian Mamatov, who was assassinated two months ago. As for the name of the other Russian woman, the French Police Department did not disclose it. It is said that the other Russian woman is only a witness, so she is only being questioned. The Japanese military police have guaranteed that the two Russian women will be released after four days of detention. The reason is that the Japanese military police are currently investigating certain espionage activities here, and the two Russian women may know about it, so they are being questioned. Another rumor is that the espionage activities investigated by the Japanese side are related to the case of the Russian actor Hofanov and three Chinese being tried after Mamatov was assassinated. At the same time, well-informed Russians reported that the other arrested Russian woman is the wife of Bolochinko, the owner of a fish shop at No. 920 Avenue Joffre. Bolochinko was arrested in Hakodate, Japan, four months ago.

After the fire broke out yesterday due to negligence, it spread immediately because the interior was full of flammable items.

The robbers were not satisfied, so before leaving, they also robbed more than ten cans of pigment worth 3,000 yuan and fled in a swarm.

Unexpectedly, Yao Linlin's attitude suddenly changed recently, and she often asked Liu for money, becoming greedy and insatiable, causing frequent quarrels between the couple. Liu suffered deeply and regretted it too late. At 7:40 AM the day before yesterday, Liu secretly hid a kitchen knife and returned home from outside, instructing Yao to get up, but she refused, causing a big quarrel. Liu first threatened her with the knife, but she resisted, so he slashed at her indiscriminately, causing her left thumb to be severed, and her head, shoulders, and arms were severely injured. Yao Chen shouted loudly for help, and Chinese constable No. 1512 and Chinese detective Wu Changkai arrived, took Yao to Hongren Hospital, and took Liu and the kitchen knife to the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court.

Article 2: During the war, public and private colleges and universities may not build or expand school buildings unless there is a special need, such as: (1) Schools in war zones relocating to open, with no public or private venues available for rent, or the rented houses are insufficient; (2) Schools relocating to open have plans to establish themselves permanently at the relocation site; (3) Schools located in non-war zones have more students from war zones, so the original school buildings exceed the maximum capacity and can no longer accommodate them; (4) Newly established schools have no suitable school buildings available for rent.

Article 3: School building construction is divided into teaching buildings, such as classrooms, laboratories, libraries, science halls, gymnasiums, auditoriums, etc., with a construction area accounting for 30% to 40% and construction costs accounting for 40% to 60%; administrative buildings, such as offices, medical rooms, etc., with an area accounting for 5% to 10% and construction costs accounting for 5% to 10%; and dormitories for staff and students, such as faculty dormitories, student dormitories, cafeterias, washrooms, toilets, etc., with an area accounting for 40% to 60% and construction costs accounting for 30% to 40%. Among all staff and student dormitories, the construction area and construction costs of faculty dormitories shall not exceed one-sixth of the total number of student dormitories.

Article 4: During the war, the construction or expansion of school buildings should focus on buildings directly related to teaching or student life, such as classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and student dormitories (including cafeterias, washrooms, and toilets). Other buildings must not be constructed unless necessary, and the cost of constructing other buildings shall not exceed 5% of the total construction cost.

Article 5: School building construction should consider the following principles:

The size and quantity of windows in each room should be designed according to the maximum number of people using the room. 4.

Chronicles

### The Rice Buying Queue

— Mu Chang

Recently, the crowd buying rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council has formed the largest queue. Seeing such a long snake formation on the road is truly nerve-wracking.

For ordinary people to make a living in this place at this time requires constant vigilance. If they hear late at night that a certain rice shop on a certain road is selling Shanghai Municipal Council rice, they will get up early in the morning, still hungry, and run to stand on the street in front of the rice shop, waiting for it to open. Five hours before the Municipal Council rice is sold, this long snake formation has already formed, winding back and forth. When the rice selling begins, this long snake formation will undoubtedly stretch past forty or fifty shop fronts. The left side of the rice shop is like this, and the right side is the same, with the queue raising its head, attracted by the rice. This forms a "double dragons snatching a pearl" situation, with a momentum of meeting opportunities from all sides!

Some children and old people cannot squeeze through the crowd. Even if they have reached "seven inches of the snake," they are still pushed out, and even beaten with sticks. They go home in tears at dusk, still with empty stomachs. To live like this, where is the justice of heaven!

Will these miserable queues for survival continue to unfold like a flood? Will they not collapse and cause a surging overflow?

Finally, there is a glimmer of dawn, opening up this path to desperation: the Shanghai Municipal Council's officially fixed prices are proceeding rapidly, and the Equalization Fund's approval of purchasing rice with US dollars has also been rumored. Large quantities of Municipal Council rice are coming in a steady stream. The rice market price has been hit hard by this and has even fallen (but yesterday the rice speculators tried to raise it again). But it is up to people to make things happen. We must get assistance to make the rice price fall sharply to a fair level. The Shanghai Municipal Council has been doing its best these days, taking care of both active and passive aspects. Recently, we can see increasingly severe punishment of cheating rice merchants; and when the rice selling expands its scope, each rice shop does not have to fight a wheel war to deal with it. Here, we must open a way for the common people who have no food to last overnight!

### Talking about Vitamins

— Jian Nong

To be honest, for many days, except for inviting people and being invited—unfortunately, these occasions are rare and few!—I have long broken off relations with old pigs, old cows, etc.—not to mention old chickens and old ducks—and become a "true" "fake" vegetarian! The so-called "true" is proven by facts; the so-called "fake" means that I have not been accepted as a member, and I also lack the compulsory courses for "authentic" vegetarians, such as eggs, milk, and fruits. As a result, I don't feel that there is anything great about it; but recently my eyes often feel dry and sore. I can't read for long before my eyelids become heavy and refuse to open anymore! And my teeth are constantly bleeding! The cause of the disease, I know clearly: it is due to a lack of vitamin A and vitamin C. However, living in today's society where rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood is as cinnamon, it is already a great fortune to not starve to death. How dare I hope to eat things rich in vitamins?

One day, I casually mentioned to a friend who had the same illness that there were too few vitamins in the food I was eating. After a moment of contemplation, he said with emotion:

"The person who translated this name is truly a saint!"

"Why are you suddenly being sentimental today?… And what does our problem have to do with the translation of the name vitamin?"

"Look how appropriate and how good this name is translated!" He still said excitedly: "It doesn't maintain 'my' life, nor does it maintain 'your' life, but it maintains 'his' life!…"

I was shocked to hear this and couldn't help but laugh silently. Later, after thinking about it, I couldn't help but burst into tears! So I made a sigh about maintaining "his" life:

Vitamin, vitamin, I heard that it can prolong life and cure diseases: to prolong life and cure diseases requires gold, looking back at Ruan Xiang, hot tears burst out! Maintaining "his" life!

Vitamin, vitamin, what are you talking about the vigor of youth; dry eyes, blood failure, bones protruding, haggard, afraid to look in the mirror! Maintaining "his" life!

Vitamin, vitamin, now poverty and sorrow are coming together: what are you talking about supporting parents and raising children? It is enough to be thankful not to be a starving corpse! Maintaining "his" life!

Vitamin, vitamin, it doesn't maintain the lives of good people, but of the strong and tyrannical: the masses are wailing, how many people are laughing, scratching their heads and asking who to ask? Maintaining "his" life!

### "Military Exercises" of People on the Isolated Island

— Yin

Except for a very small number of countries, the whole world is in the midst of flames of war and changing situations, but the isolated island is special, so there are also special "military exercises"!

Sentry Exercise: Quiet streets, tree-lined, young men and women, walking shoulder to shoulder, calm demeanor, no different from a "sentry exercise."

Street Fighting: Any hotel, transmitting the sound of "crackling" and "clapping," machine guns and rifles firing, can be called "street fighting exercise."

Charge Defense: Inside the cinema, when the door opens, identify the target and charge in; when public vehicles arrive at the station, as soon as the door opens, passengers rush forward, quite like an "exercise charge"; therefore, some ticket sellers dare not open the door when they arrive at the station, probably using the door as a "defense project"!

Lightning Strike: Old, weak, women and children, carrying things, often encounter the new army—three—lightning strikes, which can be called "lightning war exercise."

Paratroopers Jumping Off Buildings: Recently, it was reported that: either due to speculation failure, or due to emotional frustration, they committed suicide by jumping off buildings, which can be considered a "paratrooper exercise."

Light Control: The power company has recently imposed a "fuel restriction fee" due to a shortage of coal. It is said that recently the maximum excess penalty has increased fifty times the basic amount! It is a precursor to the implementation of "light control"! (Someone suggested a one-shift office system, so the evening is like light control during an air raid).

### New Fun in Academia

— Qian Changnian

Ms. Z, who has just been promoted from a certain girls' middle school to a university, has not lost her innocence and has not shed her childishness, but she is quite restrained in her etiquette, and she bows deeply every time she meets a teacher. When she first arrived at a certain university, she was troubled by the lack of a way to distinguish who was a teacher and who was a classmate. After thinking hard, she came up with a plan, namely: anyone who walks with a wide stride and looks up at the ceiling is undoubtedly a professor. She bows to them; if they walk slowly with their heads down and look at the ground, they must be classmates, and bowing can be saved.

After Ms. Z implemented this plan, she couldn't help but be surprised at how many professors and how few students there were in a certain school. In fact, those who looked up at the ceiling were students, not professors, and those who bowed their heads were university teachers. Ms. Z had not been deeply involved in the world, so it is no wonder she had this misunderstanding.

Fourteen: The Life of Fighting Heroes

"But, Mr. Qian, next time you go to the small inn where I live, when you see my daughter, you must tell her not to know!" When the two of them reached the fork in the road, Qiu Haitang suddenly thought of this again, so he hurriedly reminded Qian Ruomo, because he knew that Mei Bao would never let him go to the Red Stage to be a "fighting hero."

So when he went back that night, he told a big lie.

"Oh!… I didn't expect that the Xiao family is so good, he can immediately give you a second-rate old male role. In this way, Dad, our luck is not bad!" After Mei Bao heard his lie, she couldn't help but look at her father's strange face, which was almost always plastered with Double Knife Brand smelly medicated oil advertisements, for a long time. She felt very suspicious in her heart; but she knew Qiu Haitang's hidden pain well, so naturally she didn't want to tease him and make him sad easily.

At the same time, Mei Bao herself almost made a big mistake by hiding it from her father that day.

Because she was still young, and she had seen too few sins in the world, and on the one hand, she was anxious to find a livelihood and couldn't bear to let her father work hard alone; after Qiu Haitang went out that afternoon, she went to find the landlady of the small inn herself. (Two Five Six)

### Amateur Notes

Due to the soaring prices, the profits of various industries are also very good; so card switching is becoming more popular.

When the boss makes money, he is usually required to pay income tax, and the more money he makes, the more income tax he has to pay. In today's Shanghai, it is not uncommon for 100,000 capital to earn 700,000 or 800,000, but the income tax is 300,000 or 400,000. I don't know how many of the ten bosses can spend this amount without complaint, and the bosses who are unwilling to spend it start to think about it.

There are no complicated procedures. The company that was originally called China ×× Company may now be called Shanghai ×× Company, or Big Ji may be changed to Small Ji. The former is counted as closed, and the latter is regarded as newly opened; exchange the stock or partnership contract, carve a few seals, and you can continue to operate; secondly, the accounts can be made up, especially since the government is far away?

### MGM Selects Chinese Child Stars in Chinatown

— New Film

Anna May Wong Speaks for Them

In Hollywood movies, sometimes Chinese people are needed to play roles, and they will always go to places where overseas Chinese are concentrated to find them, but the overseas Chinese who are selected are not given very important roles, so they are not noticed. This time, when MGM was filming "Miss Mischief," it needed a Chinese child star again. Therefore, as usual, it went to Chinatown to look for one.

However, finding child roles is more difficult than adults. Parents who love their children, according to Chinese tradition, do not allow their biological sons to leave their parents and go to Hollywood to act. Therefore, the people sent by MGM searched all over the Chinatowns of San Francisco and Los Angeles, but could not find a Chinese child, and they were all rejected by their parents.

Things also happened to coincide that Chinese actress Anna May Wong happened to be in San Francisco. She was mostly familiar with the families of local overseas Chinese. Therefore, when MGM's representative finally discovered a Chinese child, Wei Duna, he asked Anna May Wong to speak for him to his parents and was willing to guarantee everything before it could be accomplished.

This Chinese child star is only five years old this year. That day, he was ice skating at the foot of a mountain when he was discovered by MGM's representative. After the film "Miss Mischief" was made, according to the company, the child was very lively and did not perform badly in the film. In this film, he plays the role of a Chinese godson. We hope that this child will continue to work hard in the future, so that Hollywood will have a Chinese child star.

### After Reading "Peking Man"

— Huang Ying

After reading "Peking Man," one feels infinite pain for the decline of the scholar-bureaucrat class. At the same time, it is full of hope for the new generation.

Cao Yu can be regarded as one of the best writers in China today. The reason why he has received such high praise cannot only be attributed to the popularity of his plays and his skillful techniques. The most important point, I think, is that the characters and artistic conception he portrays are all "Chinese." A writer's success should go in this direction.

Of course, it is not difficult for us to find many roots of influence in Cao Yu's previous plays, especially "Thunderstorm," "Wilderness," etc. In "Peking Man," we can see the shadows of plays such as "The Seagull," "The Wild Duck," and "The Hairy Ape," etc., but he has already melted them into his own. This kind of skill learning is naturally necessary.

"Peking Man" is not like the author's early works, which overly play with skills. This has already reached the point of perfection; it is natural and vivid, and it portrays a Peking family vividly. He does not deliberately create tension or climax in order to cater to the audience. The author has already surpassed the stage of "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise." This can be seen from the fact that there is not a single "monologue" in the whole play. This is truly "life."

As for the characters, almost every one of them is thoughtful and meticulous, and the old grandmother and Zeng Wentao are the most obvious. If you must be demanding, then it is that Jiang Tai later became too clownish.

Probably due to the interruption during writing, the names before and after are sometimes not unified, and the fact that Chen Nanny was deaf first and then not deaf may be because she was not taken care of.

"Peking Man" is an excellent realistic work, although the author attempts to use symbolic techniques. But we hope that the author will not go down this path. Because tomorrow's "Peking Man," we will not only hear but also see. Among Cao Yu's works, it is undeniable that "Peking Man" can be regarded as the most successful one. Several friends who have read it all agree. As a reader, apart from appreciating it and hoping to see it performed, I have nothing else to say.

Ms. Lan Qing is currently one of the pillars of the "Green Treasure" stage.

Chapter 18: Vowing to Sweep Away the National Traitors, Regardless of Self

"As long as we harbor revenge and are loyal to the Ming Dynasty, there will surely be heroes within the country who sympathize with us. Why should we endure this idle anger here?" Chen Fei also said, "Brother Liu, what you said is very true. Since we have different aspirations from General Wu, there is no need for us to serve under him." Xu Jing also nodded and said, "That's right. Only ordinary people wait for King Wen before rising up. As for heroes, they rise up even without King Wen. Now the world is in great chaos, and those with ambition can rise up to reclaim the country. Why must we rely on others?" Zhang Cangqiu said, "Good, what you all say is right. Let's go, then. But where shall we go?" Xu Jing then said, "There are many heroes in the Central Plains. The area between Mount Song and Luoyang is a good place to establish a base. To the south, we can connect with the two lakes; to the east, we can connect with Wu and Yue. We can still resist the bandits and defend against the Qing soldiers! Let's go there to find opportunities." So, the four of them agreed and prepared to set off the next day, leaving Shanhaiguan and heading inland. Early the next morning, the four of them had a hearty meal, each carrying their luggage, wearing swords, riding fine horses, and left the camp, heading towards Jiugongkou. Naturally, each of them had a lot of resentment in their hearts, especially Xu Jing, who had been traveling for a long time without any achievements. Everything he saw before him made him feel frustrated. Just as it was noon and everyone was feeling a little hungry, about to look for a place to have lunch, they suddenly heard the sound of bells jingling on the main road behind them. A rider was speeding towards them, shouting loudly, "Brother Zhang, slow down! Come back quickly!" The four of them were caught off guard and suddenly startled. (122)
