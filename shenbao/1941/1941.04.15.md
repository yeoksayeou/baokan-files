### Impairment of Territorial and Administrative Integrity: Chinese Government Will Never Recognize It; Foreign Minister Wang Formally Refutes the Soviet-Japanese Declaration; News that the Soviet Union Guarantees its Policy of Aid to China Will Not Change

Chongqing. Foreign Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement on the 14th regarding the joint Soviet-Japanese declaration: "In the joint declaration issued by the Soviet Union and Japan on the 13th of this month when they signed the Neutrality Pact, it was stated that Japan respects the integrity and inviolability of the territory of the so-called 'Mongolian People's Republic,' and the Soviet Union respects the integrity and inviolability of the territory of the so-called 'Manchukuo Empire.' It goes without saying that the four northeastern provinces and Outer Mongolia are parts of the Republic of China and are Chinese territory. The Chinese government and people will never recognize any agreement between third countries that impairs the territorial and administrative integrity of China, and solemnly declare that the joint declaration announced by the Soviet Union and Japan is absolutely invalid for China." (14th dispatch)

Chongqing. According to responsible sources obtained by Reuters, the Chinese government, after deliberation at a meeting of various leaders, has telegraphed Moscow, requesting a concrete clarification on certain points of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. It is reported that the government wishes to know definitively what the consequences of this pact will be, and what will happen to the Soviet Union's policy towards China. No action will be taken until a reply is received from the Soviet Union. The general population in China is dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's mention of Manchukuo, believing that the Soviet Union's official statement of respecting the territorial integrity and inviolability of Manchukuo is tantamount to recognizing it. (Reuters, 14th)

Chongqing. Reliable sources state that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact in order to determine whether it violates Article 2 of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also wishes to determine whether the Soviet-Japanese Pact explicitly implies Soviet recognition of Manchukuo. If it does, the Chinese government may lodge a protest with the Soviet Union. Article 2 of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact stipulates: "... shall not take any action or conclude any agreement which could be used by an aggressor to the detriment of the other party." Military observers believe that the new agreement will at most allow the Tokyo General Staff to withdraw four divisions from the nine divisions stationed in Manchuria, as the Japanese would never fully trust the Soviet Union and completely withdraw troops from the Soviet border. The Japanese will use the military force withdrawn from Manchuria when they begin their southward advance, either in the South Seas area or in a large-scale attack on mainland China, hoping to end the war. (United Press, 14th)

Chongqing. Chinese political figures recently revealed that at the same time as the Soviet Union and Japan concluded the Neutrality Pact, Moscow assured China that the Soviet Union's basic policy of assisting China would not be affected by this pact. Foreign Minister Wang also stated that the Soviet-Japanese declaration is not binding on China. Since neither the pact nor the declaration is binding on China, there is no need for China to lodge a protest. Chinese sources also pointed out that Foreign Minister Wang did not comment on the pact itself, and that his remarks were directed only at the joint Soviet-Japanese declaration. (United Press, 14th)

Washington. A person usually reliable and very well-informed about Soviet activities stated that although the Soviet Union and Japan signed a Neutrality Pact, they have not abandoned their aid to China. Japan had previously insisted that the Soviet Union stop aiding China as a condition for concluding the pact, but the Soviet Union ultimately refused. These people believe that, from the Soviet Union's point of view, continuing to aid China is very important to the Soviet Union. (United Press, 14th)

New York. The New York Times recently elaborated on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, saying that the conclusion of the pact is actually detrimental to China's position. Although the pact will not immediately divide China into Soviet and Japanese spheres of influence, Japan will be able to act more freely in China as a result. At the same time, this pact will deepen the rift between the Chongqing government and the Communist Party of China, and will force Britain to make every effort to strengthen its strength near Singapore. It also raises the question for the United States of how much naval power it should maintain in the Atlantic and Pacific. On the surface, in a nutshell, this new pact can be said to be a diplomatic victory for Hitler. However, the opposite may be true in reality. (United Press, 14th)

Chongqing. There are varying views on the significance of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. Some people believe that the Soviet Union suspects Germany and wants to obtain Japan's neutrality in preparation for a Soviet-German conflict. Most people believe that the Soviet Union is encouraging Japan to advance southward. In any case, China may not be able to continue to obtain Soviet assistance in the future, but China's determination to fight will not be affected in the slightest. Another group of people even said that Japan may not immediately advance southward, but may withdraw elite troops from Manchuria to China in order to end the China Incident. Xinhua Daily reported this morning on the news of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Pact. (Havas, 14th)

(2) If either of the Contracting Parties becomes the object of attack by one or more third Powers, the other Party shall observe neutrality throughout the entire period of hostilities.

(3) This Agreement shall enter into force from the date of its ratification and shall be valid for five years.

### Contents of the Declaration

The Governments of the Soviet Union and Japan, in accordance with the spirit of the Neutrality Pact signed on April 13, and for the purpose of ensuring peaceful and friendly relations between the two sides, solemnly declare that the Soviet Union is determined to respect the integrity and inviolability of the territory of Manchukuo, and at the same time Japan is determined to respect the integrity and inviolability of the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic. Signed by Molotov, representative of the Soviet Government; Matsuoka and Tatekawa, representatives of the Japanese Government. Moscow, April 13, 1941. (TASS, 14th)

Tokyo. Tokyo is planning to implement the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact as soon as possible. The details of the pact have been sent to the Emperor and Prime Minister Konoe. The Emperor summoned many politicians last night. Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement saying, "I firmly believe that this Soviet-Japanese pact will be the foundation for the rapid resolution of various pending issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, and will be of great help in promoting world peace. The mutual respect between the two countries for the inviolability and territorial integrity of 'Manchukuo' and the 'Mongolian People's Republic' will ensure the peace and tranquility of the 'Manchu'-Soviet and 'Manchu'-Mongolian borders. Japan initially concluded the Tripartite Pact in order to prevent the spread of war and preserve the peace of Greater East Asia, but the completion of this goal requires a fundamental adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations."

### The Story of Sergeant Fan Wenruo's Loyal and Brave Fighting

Shaoguan. On March 19, in the battle of Fanchi Ridge, which belongs to Conghua, a Chinese division's XX unit, in coordination with a platoon of infantry, engaged in a day-long fierce battle with more than 600 Japanese troops, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Sergeant Fan Wenruo led a light machine gun group and flanked the Japanese at the southern end of Qingshan Grand Cave. During the battle, the gunner was seriously wounded by shrapnel, and the reserve gunner and ammunition soldier were also wounded in succession. At that time, the Chinese firepower weakened, and the Japanese took advantage of the situation to attack. At a critical moment, Fan Wenruo acted as the gunner himself and fiercely attacked a charging Japanese soldier. He was then shot in the back, and his ammunition ran out. As the Japanese approached, Fan Wenruo calmly used his bayonet to commit suicide, and everyone who heard about it shed tears. After receiving the report, a deputy commander-in-chief considered the sergeant's loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice to be worthy of commendation, and has submitted a request to the central government for preferential treatment and compensation for his family.

Editorial

### The Cause and Effect of the Soviet-Japanese Pact

Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has finally returned to Tokyo.

Matsuoka's personal and distant journey was, on the surface, a dedicated courtesy visit to Germany and Italy, but in reality, it was an attempt at a diplomatic offensive against the Soviet Union, which he was not at all sure of and absolutely reluctant to talk about. A dedicated courtesy visit is the surface of the surface; and to窥伺 Hitler's true intentions, to investigate the internal situation and strength of Germany and Italy, to assess the trends of victory and defeat in the European war, and to privately calculate how Japan's use of the Tripartite Pact would be relatively harmless, this was his openly secret mission, which is the inside of the surface. Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Berlin, he encountered the drastic changes in Yugoslavia, which clearly demonstrated its determination to preserve its autonomy and independence, and refuted the idea that the path to a new order of peace in Europe was not working; upon arriving in Rome, he witnessed the Italian navy's great defeat, which refuted the idea that Italy's "inland lake," the Mediterranean, was still in the old order controlled by others. The obviously thorny relationship with Germany and Italy made Japanese diplomacy appear even more isolated and hesitant, so Matsuoka returned home in despair, with little face to see the elders of Edo. Fortunately, he stayed in Moscow again and signed the Soviet-Japanese pact.

Japan has had its traditional policy towards the Soviet Union for half a century. When the war against China became a heavy burden, and the European war stirred up his ambition to advance southward, the attitude towards the Soviet Union in the past two or three years was artificially ingratiating. Analyzing its illusion, it was to conclude a treaty, adjust national relations, so that the Soviet Union would no longer aid China, and help solve the so-called China Incident; in order to free up the remaining forces and wait for the opportunity to advance southward. This intention has long become a common diagnosis in the world forum. This newspaper has also repeatedly pointed out that although Japan intends to do so, and although there is a possibility of concluding any kind of treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan, the Soviet Union will never give up its aid to China in exchange for a piece of paper to Japan. Up to now, the Soviet-Japanese pact has been signed, and the so-called adjustment of national relations may also be based on this, Matsuoka has not made this trip in vain, and may boast loudly, boast of the success of the diplomatic offensive, and triumph with a spring breeze. But what this newspaper has pointed out in the past can now be confirmed to be correct. By examining the clauses of the Soviet-Japanese pact, it can be clearly understood.

According to the Japanese translation of the Soviet-Japanese pact, the text of the agreement has four articles and one exchange statement. The first article stipulates that both sides aim at peace and friendship and mutually respect the integrity and inviolability of each other's territories. The second article stipulates that if one of the Soviet and Japanese countries becomes the target of military action by two third countries, the other country should strictly maintain neutrality during the conflict. The third and fourth articles are not of great importance. The exchange statement directly calls this agreement a "neutrality treaty" and involves the Sino-Mongolian border. After this agreement is signed, as long as it is valid for one day in fact, Japan will be free from worries in the north in theory for one day; Japan, which has been mired in a deep abyss for a long time, will feel comforted by the legal freedom from worries in the north; indeed, this is the only comfort that Japan has long yearned for, the highest comfort. Apart from this, the agreement does not give Japan any greater comfort. Not only that. When Japan becomes the target of military action by any country, the Soviet Union has no obligation to remain neutral; in the undeclared war between China and Japan, the Soviet Union is of course not bound by this agreement and has no obligation, that is, it can still continue to advance its consistent policy of aiding China for several years; if the United States or Britain goes to war with Japan, how to interpret the second article of this agreement also retains the possibility of turning against us. Therefore, if Japan intends to solve the so-called China Incident and concludes this treaty, it is really equivalent to picking up the box and leaving the pearl; if it intends to advance southward and concludes this treaty, the actual effect is not yet known, but it has gained a few comforts, which can be regarded as a few encouragements.

Encouragement is just encouragement, and it will not become a factor for Japan to launch a southward advance because of this. The animosity and suspicion between the Soviet Union and Japan is the total accumulation of rights and wrongs, interests and harms, and various spaces and times over the past half century. We dare not boldly believe so deeply that it has been completely offset by a paper document now. But looking at the area where the boundaries of the two sides are adjacent, heavy troops will still be stationed, why is it not still suspicion? What's more, from another cycle to seek, there are other places of mutual generation and mutual restraint: The issue of Japan's southward advance, even if the war against China is not included in the measurement, must first be free from worries in the north, and still wait for the day when Germany wins and Britain loses; the more Germany progresses with military achievements, the more the Soviet Union will strengthen its pressure on Germany: The heavier the Soviet pressure, the more elusive the hope of Germany's victory; the more elusive Germany, the more Japan hesitates. Although the evolution of international forces is not allowed to be fully included in this simple mode, how can we determine the ingenuity of mutual traction? Just like this Soviet-Japanese agreement, it is what Japan has been longing for, but those who promoted the completion of the agreement, instead of saying that Germany has been pulling it together from it, would be better to make the opposite observation, regarding it as Germany's expansion to Eastern Europe, which is not satisfactory to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union began to give Japan a little color in the East in order to deal with Germany in Europe.

### British Comments on Soviet-Japanese Agreement: No Major Changes to the Current Situation; US Officials Express No Surprise; German Eastward Policy Reversed

London. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent said that the treaty of friendship and neutrality signed by the Soviet Union and Japan is a novel form of international treaty. In practice, this neutrality treaty is not as extensive as the non-aggression treaty signed by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, because the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression treaty stipulates that both sides will continue to pursue a friendly policy, even if one party is invaded. The current Soviet-Japanese treaty only stipulates that one party will allow the other to remain neutral when it is the object of military action by a third country. Therefore, in theory, if the Soviet Union is attacked by the Axis powers, Japan's actions will be bound by this treaty. Similarly, if Japan is attacked by any party, the Soviet Union must remain neutral. However, if either party takes the initiative in military action, what attitude should the other party take? This is clearly not expressly stipulated. This omission is definitely not due to negligence, so it is very meaningful, because it leaves an open door to consider various events. Therefore, generally speaking, this agreement cannot be said to have made major changes to the current situation. The recognition of the current situation in Manchuria and Outer Mongolia is only a proof of the already existing situation that has become a fact. As for the issue of Soviet aid to Chongqing, the negotiations have not mentioned a single word in the notification. (Reuters, 14th)

Washington. The State Department did not express surprise or criticize the conclusion of the neutrality treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan. The general impression is that this agreement is equal to nothing, and does not represent a real compromise in which Japan can expand its actions and use its army in other areas. Well-informed sources expressed doubts that this agreement would reduce Soviet aid to China. If it does not reduce aid to China, then it is difficult to understand how this agreement can benefit Japan's position in China. However, Japan's feeling of insecurity about the Manchurian border may be slightly reduced. (Reuters, 14th)

Washington. After the Soviet Union and Japan signed the neutrality treaty, US Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles both went to the State Department to discuss the matter, but they did not want to comment on this new development. Political figures believe that the Soviet Union's signing of this agreement is a major blow to US policy, and that the US Navy's strategic issues and the US-Japan relationship have become more complicated due to the signing of this agreement. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)

### Creates a Threat to Britain and the United States, Gives Japan Freedom to Advance Southward

New York. Diplomats in Washington yesterday unanimously believed that the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty was a diplomatic reversal for Hitler and his attack on Tatar Neil, and the end of the anti-Soviet line. Berlin and Rome greatly praised the treaty. Many diplomats in Washington believe that this treaty creates a threat to Britain and the United States, because the treaty obviously gives Japan the freedom to extend its power to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. Britain's first reaction was that the treaty was not unfavorable to Britain, because the treaty indicated that the Soviet Union should increase its intention to cope with Germany's expansion. German sources in Berlin believe that this treaty is another favorable diplomatic development for the Three Powers. Although there was no comment from official circles, the German official news agency quickly published all the news about the treaty, showing Germany's approval. Italian sources in Rome praised the treaty as a victory for the Three-Power Alliance. It is generally believed that the treaty, regardless of reducing Britain and the United States' hopes for the Soviet Union to join the British and American side, diplomatic observers in London said that the Soviet-Japanese treaty damaged the Axis alliance, because Japan was no longer bound by helping Germany against the Soviet Union. Military observers in London said that it would not be surprising if the troops on both sides of the Siberian border were withdrawn. The greatest interest of observers in Washington is not in the provisions of the treaty, but in the treaty's failure to mention the relationship between Germany or the Tripartite Pact and the Soviet Union's attitude towards China. The United States' interest in the treaty includes its impact on the European war and its possible development in the Far East. This treaty gives the Soviet Union the freedom to oppose Germany's invasion of the Tatar Neil oil field area, because once the Soviet Union is involved in the war in Europe, it can avoid the threat in the Far East. Although observers here dare not predict the extreme development of German-Soviet relations, they said that the development of the new situation will allow Germany to make Washington's diplomatic circles pointed out that the Soviet Union's possible enemies are Germany and Japan, so the treaty actually guarantees Japan's neutrality in the event of a German-Soviet conflict.

### Japanese Naval Minister Claims Readiness for Pacific Crisis

Tokyo - Japanese Naval Minister Oikawa declared that he believed, no matter what situation arises henceforth, the Japanese Navy will never fail to meet expectations. Oikawa stated at the provincial governors' conference held here that, because world powers have been expanding their armaments since last year, Japan will naturally take careful countermeasures. Regarding this point, the Japanese Navy still needs to expand its personnel and equipment. (Fourteenth, United Press dispatch)

Chongqing - It is reported that the full text of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact has arrived in Chongqing this morning. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper headlined this news with prominent characters, stating, "Soviet Union and Japan Reach Compromise." Now that the neutrality of the Soviet Union has been secured, the crisis in the Pacific is even more pressing. Recent Japanese actions, such as the cabinet reshuffle and the division commanders' conference, all suggest that Japan intends to stir up trouble in the Pacific again. The meetings in Manila and Singapore may be aimed at this new development. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo - Newspapers here today have given prominent coverage to the newly established Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, unanimously welcoming it as beneficial to world peace. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the pact makes the Tripartite Alliance even more powerful. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the pact has dealt a major blow to American Pacific strategy. The Asahi Shimbun stated that the pact can advance Japan's work in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. A Japanese observer stated that the pact sufficiently strengthens Japan's position in resisting Britain, the United States, and China. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo - Afternoon newspapers here are continuing to publish satisfied comments on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, stating that it is helpful in resolving the China Incident. The newspaper stated that what Japan is most concerned about regarding the crisis in the Pacific is the problem of facing both the United States and the Soviet Union simultaneously. Now that this pact has been signed, Japan can abandon this dual strategy. It also stated that, from today onwards, Japan can concentrate its strength on southward expansion, and this stance of Japan constitutes the most important significance of this pact. (Fourteenth, United Press dispatch)

Washington - Senator Nye, a spokesperson for the non-interventionist faction in Congress, stated yesterday that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact puts "the United States at a disadvantage." Observers stated that the Soviet-Japanese pact may be an "invitation to war" in the Pacific. (Fourteenth, International News Service dispatch)

### Allied Italian-German Forces in North Africa Capture Sollum Port on Egyptian Border; British Forces Preemptively Withdraw from Bardia Port; Isolated Forces Still Defending Tobruk

London - If the report from Rome that German forces have captured Bardia is confirmed, it means that all the gains made by British forces in their previous conquest of the eastern half of Libya (i.e., Cyrenaica) have been lost. Allied German-Italian forces have now reached the Egyptian border, threatening the Suez Canal. Bardia is only five miles north of the Egyptian border. British forces previously captured it on January 5th with a large-scale land, sea, and air operation. This time, Zhou Xingguo's tanks have entered the city again. In total, the British forces have retreated four hundred miles and are now in a position where they have their backs to the water and cannot retreat any further. The reason for the weakened strength of British forces in Cyrenaica is their deployment to reinforce Greece. Churchill reported in the House of Commons last week that the British General Staff had not anticipated the German offensive in Libya to be so early and so fierce. British forces had planned to retreat to Tobruk to hold a stronger position, but German mechanized forces bypassed it and went straight to Bardia and the Egyptian border. Currently, there may still be isolated British forces trapped in Tobruk. (Fourteenth, United Press dispatch)

Cairo - Well-informed sources here have revealed the rapid progress of the Libyan front. Fighting is currently taking place near Sollum Port on the Egyptian border. It is reported that on Saturday and Sunday, a mechanized enemy column, bypassing Tobruk (75 miles west of the Libyan border), captured Bardia Port on the Libyan border. Fighting is also taking place in the Tobruk area. It is reported that the British forces in that area are not surrounded nor in danger of being wiped out. A British mechanized column is able to cross the desert and make contact with them. It is reported that the strength of British forces on the western desert front is increasing daily. From this perspective, the situation of British forces is much better than it was a week ago. It has not been disclosed whether British forces are holding the double fortified defensive works built by the Italians in Tobruk. The Germans will probably attack these defenses, which have been repelled by British forces. A large British force is stationed in Tobruk, preventing part of the German force from being redeployed elsewhere. It is widely believed that the German mechanized units' gasoline is transported by aircraft, but the quantity is relatively small. The German rate of advance has probably caused wear and tear on their vehicles, and German casualties in the desert fighting have also been quite heavy. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, it is noteworthy that the Axis powers have not claimed to have captured any enemy soldiers "around Tobruk and during the occupation of Bardia." This is a factor that will determine the outcome of the desert fighting. Only General Wavell knows the exact number of British troops remaining in Tobruk. Summer is approaching, and the heat is unbearable, which those who have not experienced it cannot believe. Moreover, there is no water to be obtained for miles around. Therefore, any general who leads an army to besiege this heavily defended city will not be able to cope easily, while the British forces stationed in the city have ample water and occupy defensive positions built by the Italians. Furthermore, the British control the sea, making it easy to redeploy reinforcements. Therefore, if the Axis forces disregard Tobruk and attack Egypt, their communications will be seriously threatened by Tobruk. General Wavell's plans have not been disclosed, but after British Colonial Secretary Moyne's speech in the House of Lords on Thursday, it is credible that holding Tobruk is part of Wavell's plan. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that throughout Friday night and on Saturday and Sunday, British aircraft widely attacked enemy tank units and other vehicles near Tobruk, inflicting heavy casualties and destroying many vehicles. British fighter planes also strafed enemy motor transport vehicles in the Gazala area, inflicting heavy damage. On Friday night, RAF bombers repeatedly attacked targets in the area and heavily bombed the Gazala airfield. Munitions depots also took hits and exploded. On Friday night, some German planes attacked Malta; one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The area did not suffer major damage, and there were few casualties. In Abyssinia, British aircraft attacked enemy airfields, inflicting heavy damage on several enemy aircraft and motor transport vehicles on the ground. South African fighter planes also attacked an enemy airfield, setting fire to and destroying four enemy aircraft on the ground. Three British aircraft that went out on missions did not return, but the pilots of two were rescued. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Cairo - Official sources announced that the two British columns advancing along the Taixi-Gonda road in Abyssinia are still being held up due to road destruction. At the same time, the number of patriotic Abyssinians is increasing daily, and many Italians are requesting British protection. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)

London - A British War Office communiqué stated that there has been fighting in the areas of Gazala, El Adem, Tobruk, and Bardia in North Africa, with British forces engaging in skirmishes with enemy mobile units. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)

It is reported that all Chinese employees of the Duchen Hotel on Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road (the Huazhong and Duchen are both Sassoon-owned) have also recently submitted requests to management for a wage increase (because the management rejected it), they went on strike on the morning of the day before yesterday.

However, the management has rejected this request, and all workers in the factory have been on strike since the day before yesterday. As of yesterday, the issue had not been resolved, and labor and management are currently at a standstill.

Box Industry Agrees to Increase Rice Subsidy

The Shanghai Box Industry Labor-Management Cooperation Committee issued a notice on increasing rice subsidies for workers' families: "In view of the fact that workers in our box industry have been facing great difficulties in their livelihoods in recent years due to the impact of high prices, in addition to once increasing wages by 32.5% in March of last year and issuing rice subsidies to workers' families in January of this year, amounting to 20 cents per day for regular workers and 15 cents per day for odd-job workers, in view of the further increase in rice prices, and out of consideration for the workers, it has been decided through labor-management consultation to revise the rice subsidies for workers' families from May 1st of the 30th year of the Republic of China as follows: the daily subsidy for regular workers will be increased from 20 cents to 45 cents, and the daily subsidy for odd-job workers will be increased from 15 cents to 35 cents. The above rice subsidies will be issued at the end of the month together with wages (only those who hold worker certificates issued by the Box Industry Association and the Vocational Association are entitled to the rice subsidy). It has been agreed upon by both labor and management that if rice prices fall back to within 60 yuan after this notice, the rice subsidies set in January of the 30th year of the Republic of China will be restored (i.e., 20 cents per day for regular workers and 15 cents per day for odd-job workers). If rice prices fall back to within 40 yuan, the above rice subsidies will be canceled. If rice prices continue to rise to 150 yuan, the rice subsidy will be further increased (rice prices are calculated based on No. 2 rice). We hope that all workers will work with peace of mind and share the difficulties together. We hope everyone is aware of this."

### German Forces to Attack Allied Forces in Mainland Greece on Several Routes; First Major Battle About to Begin; British Reinforcements Continuously Entering Greece

London - German forces, which have invaded southern Yugoslavia and Thrace in a sweeping fashion, yesterday divided their forces into five routes to advance towards the Anglo-Greek defensive line spanning mainland Greece. Skirmishes have already begun, serving as a prelude to the first major battle between British and German land forces since the Battle of Dunkirk. The Anglo-Greek defensive line forms a salient, from Dibeli, Florina, Kozani, to Katerini, with the salient point being in the Florina area. According to recent intelligence, German forces have stormed into the Monastir Gap, while another column is advancing northeast from Thessaloniki along the main Thessaloniki route, attempting to converge with the troops storming into the Monastir Gap. It is widely believed that another German attack route is to advance westward from Thessaloniki on the Allied left flank. According to German sources, German forces have made contact with Italian forces in the Topola and Oritda areas. This move will increase pressure on Greek forces in Albania. Most of the military activity of German and Italian forces in Greece yesterday was exploratory warfare to determine the strength of the Greek defensive line. According to news reaching here from the English Channel, Allied forces are still holding their positions on the original line. Athens broadcast yesterday that recent intelligence indicated that the situation on the front line was "most satisfactory." Radio also said that "it is believed that the new Anglo-Greek defensive line is absolutely safe," and that forces in southern Yugoslavia have reached the southern and central mountains of Serbia, "where they will be able to resist for a longer period of time." It was also stated that patrol activities are still continuing in the Monastir area. It is widely believed that neither the Anglo-Greek nor the German forces have launched a large-scale offensive in that area. Authoritative sources here are delighted with the progress of forces in southern Yugoslavia and attribute it to the commander of the southern forces, who is directing them independently. However, people are skeptical that this independent victory will be able to prevent large-scale German action. However, military sources say, "The mountain troops in southern Yugoslavia have gained a favorable position, and the southern forces have proven that they are one of the best soldiers in the world." However, German forces have encountered a new tactic of modern warfare, namely that numerous independent units are launching guerrilla warfare in an organized line and starting to fight Hitler's army in the most advantageous positions. Observers believe that this tactic will make it difficult for the German high command to cope and will hinder its cooperation with Italian forces in fighting the Anglo-Greek forces in Albania.

### Southern Forces Retreat into the Mountains; Plan to Hold Out for the Long Term

London - According to news here, the situation in the Balkans at the end of the week is slightly more favorable to the Allied forces. British forces in northern Greece engaged in the first major battle with German forces, driving back the German forces, while Serbia is also strengthening its resistance to the strong pressure from the Axis powers. It is reported that a column of German forces driven back by British forces consisted of tanks and infantry. A Berlin dispatch from a Stockholm newspaper on the Balkan situation states that although the Serbian forces have suffered heavy losses, their front line has not been broken. Berlin admits that the difficulties of the Balkan war still need to be overcome. Sources in Budapest claim that Serbian forces have occupied the entire Baranya triangle (formerly Hungarian territory). According to sources in London, German forces in southern Yugoslavia have been driven back to Suharika, and the Serbian forces are advancing towards the Kačamik Gorge and have engaged German armored forces in the village of Topola, 20 miles from Belgrade. The village has now been isolated. Serbian forces in the Kragujevac and Kruševac areas are holding their positions and have overcome Belukopri. According to reliable sources in London, the situation in northwestern Yugoslavia is still confused, but it is known that Serbian forces are currently fighting on both sides of the Morava River. German broadcasts state that Serbian Prime Minister Simović has instructed Serbian military commanders to act on their own initiative, and there are indeed signs that Serbian military commanders are fighting independently, with some having achieved significant victories and leading troops down from the mountains. A Columbia Broadcasting System reporter quoted a spokesperson for the Serbian embassy in Istanbul as saying that most of the Serbian forces have retreated into the mountains without much loss, and that if the military supplies shipped from the Dalmatian coast continue to flow in, they will be able to hold out in the mountains for a long time. A Hungarian spokesman claimed that Hungarian troops advancing towards the southern border have reached Ujvidek, and that paratroopers have occupied important bridges far from the army and are continuing to hold them, awaiting the arrival of mechanized forces. Serbia has destroyed several bridges in an attempt to hinder the Hungarian advance. At the same time, the Serbian city of Sarajevo was also bombed by German forces. The city is the capital of Bosnia, where the assassination of the Archduke of Austria sparked the Great War of 1914. A German news agency claimed that German planes attacked the city, hitting the station and large barracks in the city center, causing a large fire and significant damage.

Athens - According to news received here, the Yugoslav front on the Bulgarian border was broken shortly after the Nazi invasion, due to the concentrated advance of German tanks, but the price paid by the Germans was also very heavy. Judging from the situation, in an area north of the Strumeica Valley, that is, where the borders of Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece meet, there seems to be no organized defensive line. The speed of the German advance caught the Serbian forces off guard. Defending the above-mentioned area was a Serbian division that fought bravely in an attempt to contain the advance of the German armored divisions. As for the attacking German forces, 170 tanks broke through along the Strumeica Valley. Two regiments of Serbian forces, carrying anti-tank guns, bravely defended their positions. In the first German attack, 20 tanks were lost, and in the second, 24. However, nine of them broke through the Serbian defenses, and other large numbers of tanks poured in, reaching the Vardar Valley and moving towards Thessaloniki. At the same time, there were German columns that invaded Serbian territory at three locations further north along the Serbian-Bulgarian border. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)

### Anglo-Greek Allied Forces Lose Contact with the South

London: The isolated Southern Army was still fighting fiercely in the Serbian mountains yesterday. However, since the German forces had broken through the Vardar River basin and the Monastir Anglo-Greek forces, it seemed there was no hope of contacting the Southern Army. After the two areas were defeated, the Greek forces defending the crucial Berahissa defense line were encircled. Military experts here deeply regretted the errors in battlefield communication. It is also believed that Nazi troops broke through the Anglo-Greek lines on several fronts. (Taiwan Public Telegram, 14th)

Athens: According to responsible sources, British and Imperial troops continued to arrive in Greece. British infantry repelled an attack by the German Blackshirt "Hitler" division in northern Greece during Easter and inflicted heavy casualties.

No major battles have yet occurred between the British and German forces on this front. Athens Radio also stated that the German forces were advancing in Shangmitalo, northern Greece. So far, all battles between the Anglo-Greek forces have been limited to clashes between vanguard motorized units. The British Air Force has bombed several enemy convoys in the Monastir area. It is said that the German side has suffered heavy losses in tanks and troops in the area. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)

The vanguard troops advancing from Zara, including motorcycle units and light tank units, encountered some resistance, but with the assistance of the air force, they occupied Benkovac, the largest town in Dalmatia, located two thousand kilometers southeast of Zara. At the same time, infantry, artillery, and heavy troops advanced south from Fiume, occupying Signa and Ottovatz between Fiume and Zara. A marine unit besieged islands near Ulcinj. At least six islands along the Yugoslav coast have been occupied by Italian marines. News here says the marines were transported by sturdy speedboats and were equipped with machine guns and hand grenades. (United Press Telegram, 14th)

London: It is widely believed that Durazzo, an important seaport on the northern coast of Albania, has been captured by Yugoslav troops. If this is confirmed, it would be a major blow to the Italian forces, as the port has been the main concentration point for Italian troops and supplies since the port of Vlora was repeatedly bombed by British aircraft. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)

Athens: A communiqué was released here yesterday stating that Royal Air Force bombers successfully attacked German motorized transport units in the Monsti and Florina areas on Saturday.

### The Domestic Situation in Turkey Is Quite Stable

Istanbul: Rumors circulated that the Turkish government had declared martial law nationwide, that all transportation had been taken over by the military authorities, and that residents of certain cities had begun to evacuate. Authorities here have denied this, saying that there are no new measures other than the declaration of preparedness last December. The government has decided to establish a "Domestic Propaganda Office" to prevent rumors from spreading. People's minds here have become increasingly stable in recent days, and residents celebrated Easter with great joy. The reasons for this are: first, the Greek forces from Xylomouri on the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea can firmly defend their lines; second, the Yugoslav forces can also bravely fight in the mountainous areas of Herzegovina; third, the Soviet government has sternly condemned Hungary's invasion of Yugoslav territory, proving that the Soviet Union has not abandoned its interests in Southeastern Europe; fourth, the German ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, hinted that his country does not want to conflict with Turkey, and that there is still a possibility of understanding between the two sides; and fifth, the withdrawal of Bulgarian troops from the Turkish border has eased the situation.

Random Notes on the European War (4)(6)

### A Panoramic View of the United States Navy

On the USS "Idaho" or any battleship, only the captain or admiral (if present on board to command the fleet) can enjoy private living quarters. Everyone on board, whether sailor or marine, must get used to eating together, dressing together, arranging their hammocks together, and gaming or fighting together. However, although everyone lives together, everything on this warship is cleaner than anywhere else in the world. Naval authorities make each person serving on board, or a group of several people, fully responsible for the arrangement and protection of a designated part of the ship. This method is quite effective because every sailor thinks that the turret, bridge, or the ship's boat used by the captain belongs to him personally. Sometimes the meaning of this ownership even extends to the point where the sailors responsible for these places move their own hammocks to the turret or boat to sleep in.

Discipline is strict on warships, but it seems slightly looser than in the army. All actions on board are based on bugle calls. The rapid wake-up call is blown at 5:30 AM to start everything. The lights-out call is blown at 9 PM to end the day. During the day, sailors scrub the decks, polish all metal objects, practice firing cannons, attend mechanical engineering classes, have dental examinations, get haircuts, eat three nutritious meals, buy ice cream, read newspapers, and write and send letters. Before going to sleep, they even watch a movie or slideshow and sing their favorite familiar tunes and ditties.

Officers on board often play a type of deck tennis for exercise. Sailors do calisthenics every morning at 9:00 AM. Classes are held from 1:15 PM to 2:30 PM to provide recruits with essential training. Some sailors learn how to navigate or manage machinery. Rules of navigation and sailing are included in the study.

The ship's bakery makes 240 large loaves of bread and 190 biscuits every day. The bakers are recruited from the enlisted men and are taught cooking skills by the Navy. Every day, the food eaten by each soldier is tasted by a junior officer to see if it meets the standards. If there is a difference, he will report it to the commanding officer for correction. When the captain eats, he eats alone in a refined cabin. On warships like the USS "Idaho," there is a Filipino servant who is dedicated to serving him. When the captain rests, he is also alone, strolling on the deck.

Cooks must bring coffee pots on deck for inspection every day. Each sailor can drink twelve cups of coffee a day, so the coffee pot is always boiling there, almost without stopping. Ice cream is sold cheaply on board, and the profits are used to purchase movie projectors and various sports equipment.

Whether it is a battleship, cruiser, or destroyer, a movie is shown every night. When warships meet each other at sea, they stop to exchange films.

Haircuts on board cost one and a half U.S. dollars for soldiers and two and a half cents for officers. According to naval regulations, soldiers' hair cannot be allowed to grow beyond two inches. After the soldiers are free, they either read books and newspapers or write letters home. There are special mailboxes on the ship.

During their leisure time, officers can play cards in the lounge or indulge in their own "hobbies" and pass the time as they please. The ship is equipped with a mobile printing press, which is a standard device stipulated by the Navy. It publishes a newspaper on board every day, and the editor is the ship's chaplain.

Senior sailors can sleep on cots, while new recruits sleep in hammocks. Everyone has a locker with military hats, towels, toiletries, and even photos of his loved ones, all stored inside except for thick coats.

(II) A Glimpse of Naval Exercise Warfare

We all know who the United States Navy's hypothetical enemy is during exercise warfare. The following is a report from a news reporter participating in the United States Navy exercise warfare. The "we" mentioned in the text refers to the United States Naval Fleet. (To be continued)

### Food: Foreign Rice Is Stirring Up Again, with Over 30,000 Bags of Rice Arriving Yesterday, and the Price of Rice Rising by Seven to Eight Yuan in a Single Day

Foreign rice is constantly arriving in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Ming Sang freighter arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 13th), carrying 14,647 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Swire Company's Haikou freighter arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 17,750 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at Swire Dock in the French Concession, beginning unloading this morning. (Reporter Zu)

After the market opened yesterday morning, foreign rice saw strong real sales demand from local customers due to the consecutive holidays, while demand from inland and western Shanghai groups was even more voracious. Speculators stirred up trouble, and floating retailers added fuel to the fire, creating a tense and extremely serious situation in the market. Rumors abounded, such as Siam banning exports, Hong Kong banning transportation, and the Japanese army advancing south, all of which were used by those holding goods to raise prices. However, orders from Saigon continued to arrive, occupying an increasingly important position. New transactions included an agreement for 1,000 tons from Saigon in April and May, priced at 136 yuan (some say 135.5 yuan), thrown out by Shenji. In addition, there are two or three other possible agreements. However, the market remains tense. The early market price for No. 1 Saigon reached 119 yuan, No. 2 was 115-116 yuan, No. 2+ was 118 yuan, Fire Mark was 118 yuan, Small Twisted White Body was 116 yuan, Middle Gate was 114-115 yuan, Tokyo Tip was 110 yuan (down to 107 yuan), Broken Tip was 95-96 yuan (down to around 90 yuan), an increase of four to five yuan compared to before the holiday. In the afternoon, buying interest increased further, and the price for No. 1 even saw shouts of 121-122 yuan. Shanghai-British traded April at 137 yuan, No. 2 was currently 138.5 yuan, Mixed Broken was 109.5-110 yuan, and No. 3 Broken Rice was 98 yuan. Small Twisted was currently 139-140 yuan, and shouts were being raised for an increase of two, three, or four yuan in the afternoon. Shanghai-British traded nearly 3,000 tons throughout the day, and there were more than 3,000 bags of current rice.

Due to the multi-day market closure, there were no fewer than one or two hundred loads of thick and thin japonica and other national rice, and the sales side generally saw that foreign rice was so firm and strong, and their appetite increased accordingly. Owners seized this good opportunity, and the intention to sell was even tighter, shouting wildly. However, as a result, although the outlet was good, it was ultimately not as wide as that of foreign rice. The arrival of goods happened to be busy, and it was difficult to compete with foreign rice, with only a 2.5 yuan increase or so. The breakdown is as follows: Changbang Special Japonica Spike was seen at 125 yuan, Kunshan Spike saw Special Japonica at 122 yuan, High at 120 yuan, Secondary down to Middle Gate at 116-117 yuan, Original Package Special Japonica was 130 yuan, and Qingjiao Spike saw Thin Rice at 145 yuan.

Glutinous rice always fluctuates with foreign rice, and now is a good time, with both retail and wholesale sales being smooth, and prices rising sharply in tandem, with a huge increase of four or five yuan. Hong Kong Special was priced at 115 yuan, down to 110 yuan, Glutinous was 103 yuan, down to 100 yuan.

### Flour Increases by More Than One Yuan

Flour: Yesterday was the day the Miscellaneous Grains Market reopened after the Spring Festival holiday. Since the financial securities and cotton markets had not yet opened, there were quite a few people from inside and outside the industry present. Real sales and purchases were good. It was heard that the source of Saigon foreign rice was blocked, and the price of rice rose sharply by four yuan, causing panic. Speculators took advantage of this to push up prices, and the market rose by more than one yuan in competition. The breakdown is as follows: Flower Bird Brand Australian Flour was 30.078 yuan, Golden Dragon Brand Canadian Flour was 30.00-30.01 yuan, Steamboat Flour was 30.01 yuan, and more than 20,000 bags were traded. The price of flat-selling flour from Chinese factories was still 25 yuan. It was heard that the factory was about to run out of raw materials and would stop supplying, so the market was quite bullish.

Wheat Market: The wheat market was also quietly firm. The market supply of spot goods has long been exhausted. Occasionally, small amounts of nearby domestic wheat are transported in, and they are all bought by Japanese factories. The selling price is 45-46 yuan. There have been no reports of wholesale transactions.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Oil Rises by Two to Three Yuan

Yesterday, the Miscellaneous Grains, Oil, and Cake Market was open as usual after the holiday. There were no special major changes in the overall situation. Although various market prices once soared due to the influence of rumors, both buyers and sellers lacked enthusiasm, so the situation soon returned to a soft trend. However, the environment is still advantageous, and there is still a potential for prosperity. The oil market rose by two to three yuan compared to before the holiday. The transaction volume was 600 barrels of futures Dalian oil, 300 dan of factory oil, and 10 pieces of basket oil. The price of yellow beans rose by about half a yuan, and more than 1,700 bags of each bean were traded. The only tight item was Dutch corn, and Saigon corn was tight first and then tired. A total of 2,500-2,600 bags of spot goods and 300 tons of futures were traded. Bean cake sales were sparse, and although the price rose by two to three cents, it was entirely caused by a game of passing the buck. Today, 1,000 cans of bean oil will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Futures Sugar Rises Again

Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was difficult to ease, causing futures to rise again by five cents. The association's negotiated price for the second and fourth grade coarse white spot goods was 89.65 yuan, rising to 89.66 yuan, an increase of two cents. The price for delivery on the 20th of this month ranged from 89.99 yuan to 90.01 yuan, then rose by one cent, returning to 89.7 yuan, an increase of five cents. The price for delivery at the end of the month was 90.45 yuan, 90.50 yuan, 90.70 yuan, 90.90 yuan, 91 yuan, returning to 90.05 yuan, an increase of three cents. Swire's granulated white sugar was relatively cheap, with DY Mark at 85.5 yuan unchanged.

### Metals: White Lead Sheet Remains Stable

Both the arrival and sales of white lead sheets were sparse, and there was little progress in the trend. However, the standard remained stable despite sharp increases in prices in various shops. It is found that this product is the only raw material for battery factories. Currently, eight or nine battery factories have moved from Shanghai, and white lead sheets are also on the list of prohibited export products and cannot be transported inland, so sales are difficult. In addition, although slight inquiries are seen from the Mujie Printing House and Tea Stack, the total number is not large, and the industry's sentiment is not soft, so the asking price remains firm. Yesterday, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6 were sold for 3,800 yuan per barrel, while No. 8, No. 9, No. 10, No. 12, and No. 14 were priced at 4,500 yuan per barrel.

Yesterday, 150 pieces of old copper were shipped from Hong Kong.

### Coal: Cooked Coal Is Available but Has No Market

Since Indian coal was priced high last month, the coal industry has stopped selling to customers and industry colleagues, resulting in a situation where there is supply but no market. Shops on this street have had to raise prices to search for old stack receipts and carloads on the market, so the dark market has recently been shouting for 400 yuan. The price for storefront customers is 448 yuan per ton for screened lumps, and the retail price is 22 yuan per dan.

### Miscellaneous: National Loan Mosquito Coils, Prices Up 20% Compared to Last Year

Mosquito coils are a necessity for summer. As the weather gradually warms up, factories send products to industry distributors, mostly at market prices, which are up 20% compared to last year. Sales have decreased compared to before, because the occupied areas are restricted by a certain party and mostly sell Dong cargo (猪牌) (Pig Brand), which has caused national mosquito coils to become quite bleak. Current purchase prices are 19 yuan for the Samsung Brand Large, 15.8 yuan for No. 2, 13.9 yuan for No. 3, and 4.8 yuan for loose-packed.

### Cancellation of Saturday Holidays in the Banking Industry, Zhang Mengzhao

Banking Industry: Regarding the issue of Saturday afternoon holidays, I wrote an article in this column (see my previous article "The Inappropriateness of Saturday Holidays in the Banking Industry" last year) because I felt that this measure hindered industry and commerce. Unexpectedly, it aroused a response from the gentlemen working in the banking industry. I don't know what I want to say is that in this extraordinary period, since we don't double our work, we should abide by the established rules and not give up eating because of an occasional accident. We should continue to do business as usual to benefit customers (not a personal problem). It is true that the banking industry has the mission of regulating finance and assisting the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, the banking industry should take full responsibility for the convenience of industrial and commercial exchanges. Try to see how inconvenient the Saturday afternoon holiday is for industry and commerce. In addition, the implementation of the new clock, the collection and settlement of factory, company, and merchant accounts, not only cannot be caught up, but also do less business. Especially for merchants’ business income, it must be at least half a day later before the accumulated huge amount of money can be delivered to the bank's treasury, thus taking on a lot of risks. In addition, the transfer of payment checks between merchants and those who buy and sell goods is also greatly inconvenienced because it is limited to the Saturday afternoon holiday. All kinds of losses (such as the tight time for the transfer of funds and compensation for interest, etc.) are hard to say in one word. As for whether the banking industry itself has difficulties in collecting and settling accounts, it has not been taken into account. I recently read a Chongqing telegram in this newspaper on the 13th, "The banks in our country have always closed on Saturday afternoons to sort out their internal accounts for a week. The Four Joint Offices believe that during this period of resistance construction, banks should increase business hours and improve work efficiency. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided that from the middle of April, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the Central Trust Bureau should all operate as usual on Saturday afternoons, and a letter should be sent to the Ministry of Finance ordering all local banks and commercial banks to do the same." This is indeed the right thing to do. Now, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Bank of the West in Shanghai should follow this rule and no longer hesitate. What will the commercial banks in Shanghai have to say? You don't need to worry about not being able to deposit or withdraw money again, causing trouble until seven or eight o'clock. What's more, there should be no more Saturday afternoon deposits and withdrawals in the future, so all banks should follow the order and resume business on Saturday afternoons immediately. Don't think that you are on an isolated island where government orders cannot reach you and dare to despise them. If you do so, you are simply trying to be selfish, disregarding the public interest, and treating yourself as uncivilized.

### Dry Fruit Preservation from Mold and Insects: Soon to be Stored in Cold Storage

Among dry fruits, dried longans and dried lychees are the most difficult to preserve. If they retain too much moisture when dried from fresh fruit, they easily mold and spoil. Therefore, regular inspection is necessary, and special care is needed for dried lychees. Even though they are dried with charcoal fire during the initial drying process, their fruit pits often don't dry completely. This can lead to mold or insect infestation due to the moisture in the pits. Varieties like 'Wu Ye Zhi' and 'Lan Zhu Zhi', with their larger pits, are particularly prone to this issue.

Some profit-driven merchants sell newly dried longans and lychees that haven't been sufficiently dried. This is because undried fruits are heavier, leading to higher profits. However, fruits with high moisture content cannot be stored for long. These merchants prioritize immediate gains without considering the interests of buyers. In the past, such practices were rampant during periods of low prices, resulting in significant losses due to mold and weight deductions. After rectification by both vendors and merchants in this city, these practices have gradually disappeared.

Currently, with higher prices, this issue is less prevalent. However, there are two periods when this is naturally unavoidable: the yellow plum season. During this time, the fruit becomes damp and prone to mold, insect infestation, and spoilage. Therefore, those holding stock should pre-bake the fruits before these periods to prevent future problems.

Now, scientific methods can be used to overcome this difficulty. During the yellow plum season, the fruits can be stored in cold storage, preventing both mold and insect infestations. As this time approaches, and due to the extraordinarily high cost of labor and charcoal, most of this year's stored longans and lychees will be sent to cold storage facilities for the summer. They will be stored from early May until August or September, when they will be released onto the market.

This cold storage preservation will maintain the fruit's excellent quality and allow it to be sold as new. However, prices will naturally increase due to the high cost of cold storage, which is about five or six yuan per hundred market catties per month. For four or five months, this would amount to twenty or thirty yuan per dan. It is reported that those in the industry are already preparing for this, and soon a large batch of longans and lychees will be sent to cold storage.

### Rice Prices Soar, Labor Unrest Rises: Hoarded Rice to be Forcibly Sold: Market Prices Greatly Increased Yesterday: But Reserves are Abundant and Arrivals are Crowded

Authorities Determined to Punish Strictly Those Spreading Rumors and Abusing Speculation

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that, according to reliable Chinese sources this morning (the 14th), the Shanghai Municipal Council will soon implement special measures to force hoarders to sell their stockpiled rice. The details of these measures are not yet known, as today is a holiday and it is impossible to inquire and confirm with the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Yesterday's Soaring Prices

Since the abolition of price controls, rice prices in this city have been unstoppable. Yesterday was the first market day after the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday. Under the rampant rumors spread by speculators, the price of each shi of domestic rice soared by as much as four or five yuan. If the authorities of the two concessions do not decisively take strict measures, the future of food for the citizens of this city is extremely concerning. Moreover, the recent labor unrest is all fueled by the high rice prices, which is a serious matter related to public safety. The details are recorded as follows:

Speculative Tricks

The reason for yesterday's rise in rice prices is that, after the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, general speculators feared the imminent southward advance of Japan and rushed to buy spot goods on the market. Hoarders with large quantities of spot goods further raised prices, causing market prices to rise higher and higher. Saigon No. 1 rice rose from 114 yuan to 119 yuan per shi. These illegal elements seize upon slight changes in the situation and apply their usual speculative tricks to satisfy their selfish desires. According to an expert, although the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact will change the situation in the Far East, this needs to be seen in light of England and Germany having issues in the Balkans. Speculators used this as an excuse to raise rice prices, which is absurd.

Should Prohibit Rushing Purchases

According to a normal rice merchant, this city has sufficient rice reserves, enough to supply more than five months of needs, and the source is very smooth. Although the situation in the Pacific may change, there is no need to worry about food for the citizens of this city. Yesterday, the total number of bags of foreign rice shipped to this city reached more than 40,000. The arrival of domestic rice also increased sharply yesterday. Moreover, the orders for foreign rice in April also reached more than 400,000 bags. Therefore, if the authorities can stop speculators from rushing to buy spot goods on the market, and implement the rules of retail sales and sales between firms, then speculators will not be able to be so rampant in spreading unfounded rumors on the market.

Punishment Strictly Enforced

It is also learned that although price controls on rice in this city have been abolished, the authorities of the two concessions will still punish those who hoard and manipulate prices in accordance with the hoarding and speculation laws promulgated by the National Government in the extraordinary period. "Those who are not engaged in this industry but hoard goods exceeding a certain quantity, and those who are engaged in this industry and hoard goods with the behavior of profiteering and manipulating, shall be severely punished."

### One Hundred Yuan Notes with Altered Place Names: Prohibited from Use

In order to prevent capital flight, the National Government has repeatedly issued orders to prohibit the outflow of capital. However, some people, blinded by greed, regard government orders as mere formalities and smuggle hundred-yuan notes printed with Chongqing place names from the capital to Shanghai for profit. The exchange rate for every ten thousand yuan is more than three thousand yuan. Therefore, the authorities have ordered that hundred-yuan notes printed with Chongqing names and folded with creases are refused for use. At the same time, they encourage the transfer of funds to the interior. Therefore, those who remit these banknotes to the inland will be exceptionally received. After the implementation of this measure, Shanghai place names were added to the Chongqing place names, hoping to mix them in the market. Therefore, the Central Bank authorities have issued a public notice stating that this type of hundred-yuan note with the added place name is also prohibited from use. It is hoped that all citizens will pay attention to avoid losses and being taken advantage of by criminals.

### Sin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory: Shareholders' Meeting Scheduled for Today

Since its establishment, Sin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory has been around for seventeen years. The various new drugs it manufactures, such as Xiaozhilong, are comparable to those produced in Europe and America. In addition, it has also set up a glass instrument factory, a serum vaccine factory, and a rubber factory. At the same time, it is entrusted by the American Mallinckrodt Chemical Pharmaceutical Company and the British Pharmaceutical Company to sell various experimental and analytical reagents. Under the leadership of General Manager Bao, the factory's business is thriving, and its capital has increased to several million yuan. It is reported that the factory is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting today to discuss issues such as issuing new shares and developing business.

### Public Concession: Strict Security, Major Crimes Decreasing

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, there were 371 crime cases in the Public Concession in the past week. Ordinary robbery and pickpocketing cases have increased compared to the past, but all others have decreased. A total of 477 criminals were arrested, a decrease of 122 compared to the previous week. Among them, 125 had criminal records. Now, in order to maintain good public order in the concession, the security arrangements will continue to be carried out.

### French Concession Territory: Japanese Arrest Four People in a Row: Principal, Teacher, Male Lawyer, Female Lawyer, All Now Detained by the Japanese Military Police, Reason Unknown

In the past three days, the Japanese, together with the French Concession police, have successively arrested Zhu Lin, former principal of Wu Lun Girls' High School, Tong Muge, teacher of Minli Girls' High School, and lawyers Yao Yunbo and Zhang Hongwei, and taken them to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. The details are as follows:

Principal and Lawyer

At around 7:00 AM on the 12th of this month, five plainclothes Japanese military police officers drove to the French General Patrol Room in Lujiawan and requested assistance to arrest Zhu Lin (from Hankou), former principal of Wu Lun Girls' High School, at No. 29 Yuancheng Lane, Lafayette Road. The French patrol room sent personnel to assist in the arrest and handed her over to the Japanese. Then, at around 6:00 AM on the 13th, the Japanese plainclothes military police went to the French patrol room again and requested the arrest of lawyer Yao Yunbo (zi Xiangjiu) from Yixing. They went to No. 6 Dahengfang, No. 68 Ximen Road, and arrested Yao.

Continued Arrest of Two People

After Zhu and Yao were arrested, yesterday (the 14th), at around 6:00 AM, the Japanese plainclothes military police took them to the French patrol room and requested that Chinese and Western detectives assist in arresting Tong Muge (from Chongming), a geography teacher at Minli Girls' High School, No. 612 Lafayette Road. Tong is the cousin of Tong Hangbai, the former principal of the school. Because Tong did not live in the school, they went to Tong's residence at a certain number on Saporos Road and arrested Tong. At the same time, they went to No. 25 Tiancheng Lane, No. 155 Xuehuali Road, and arrested female lawyer Zhang Hongwei (from Dongyang, Zhejiang), who joined the Lawyers Association as a member in August 1938. When Zhang was arrested, the Japanese took a photo of her husband placed on the table.

Contact Telephone

It is reported that the four people arrested by the Japanese are currently detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. Yesterday, after Tong and Zhang were arrested, their families received a phone call from someone claiming to be from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, saying that they were both detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters and would be released after interrogation, and told the families not to panic. When the Japanese went to arrest Zhang, No. 26 Tiancheng Lane mistakenly thought that there was a robbery next door and urgently telegraphed the patrol room to report it. The patrol officers rushed to the scene and realized it was a misunderstanding, and then returned. As for why the Japanese arrested them, it is not known.

### Special Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers: Announced to be Held as Scheduled: Taxpayers' Association Formally Notified About Proposed Changes to the Shanghai Municipal Council Organization

According to the official announcement of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, the special meeting and annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession will be held at 2:30 PM on the 17th at the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. It also stated that the admission tickets for the meeting have been mailed to qualified taxpayers in the concession. The Japanese are handed over to the Japanese Taxpayers Association for distribution. The association has stipulated that the procedures for collecting them will be handled at the Japanese Club from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day from the 14th to the 16th. It is heard that the important agenda item of this special meeting is the proposal to change the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Council and form a temporary board of directors, proposed by the current Chairman of the Board, Keswick, and Japanese Director Okamoto. This case is of great importance to the interests of the United Kingdom and the United States. Whether British and American taxpayers agree to change the status quo, and whether the Chinese side agrees to change the number of Chinese members and elect new candidates, are all issues of great concern.

Formally Notifying the Chinese Taxpayers

Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's change of organization and the proposal to form a temporary board of directors, the Shanghai Municipal Council has announced that it will be submitted for discussion at the special meeting of taxpayers to be convened on the 17th. It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council has officially informed the Chinese Taxpayers' Association by letter from Chairman Keswick. After receiving the letter, the association, with the chairman in Hong Kong, has sent the original letter to Hong Kong and is waiting for a decision.

Foreigners Launch Campaign to Participate in the Special Meeting

The special meeting of foreign taxpayers will be held at the Race Club on April 17th at 2:30 PM. The important agenda items are to elect the chairman and secretary of the meeting, pass amendments to the land regulations, and reorganize the board of directors. Taxpayers from various countries believe that the holding of the special meeting is of great importance to their own interests, and that the amendment of the land regulations and the reorganization of the board of directors will have an even greater impact. Therefore, community groups from various countries have been actively mobilizing taxpayers to participate in recent days. It is expected that more than 400 people will attend at that time, and the number of eligible votes may reach around 15,000. The meeting will begin at 2:30 PM. Judging from the preparations and arrangements, it will definitely be held smoothly. The amendment of the land regulations and the organization of the temporary board of directors can be approved by the majority without debate. The meeting is expected to end at 3:30 PM.

The Chairman Will Make an Important Report

The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers will be held after the special meeting of taxpayers. It will be chaired by Heilmck, the judge of the American Consulate, and the head of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, Bester, will serve as the secretary. The important agenda items include electing Western land committee members and public hospital directors for the next year, passing the Shanghai Municipal Council's report and accounts for 1940, the budget for 1941, and the report of the Control Committee. Chairman Keswick, Vice Chairman Mitchell, and other American and Japanese directors will all attend. At that time, Chairman Keswick will make an important speech, reporting on the administration over the past year and all the difficulties encountered. It is believed that the importance of this annual meeting, held after the special meeting, will be greatly reduced. All agenda items are expected to proceed smoothly without debate.

The Inauguration Date of the New Directors Remains the Same

As for the inauguration date of the next term of temporary directors, according to Article 21 of the Land Regulations, "The elected directors shall take office after the accounts of the outgoing directors have been audited and approved by the annual meeting in accordance with Articles 9 and 12 of these regulations." Therefore, the sixteen new directors can officially take office on the 18th of this month (the day after the annual meeting). As for the date of their meeting, they should convene for the first time at 4:00 PM next Wednesday (the regular meeting date). At the first meeting, they should elect one chairman and one vice-chairman. As for the candidates for chairman and vice-chairman, the competition between countries will be fierce, and the British and American directors are likely to have the highest voice.

### Japanese Inspection of Ships

According to the commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, at a reception for Western reporters in this city yesterday, the Japanese Navy's "blockade patrol team" in North China inspected 663 ships in the North China Sea last week, and 17,000 ships in the Huangpu River. They also removed three water mines in the Yangtze River.

### Aigao Escorted to Saigon: Not Yet Formally Indicted: It is Difficult to Predict What Kind of Interrogation He Will Undergo: Thorough Investigation Required Before Trial

According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, Aigao, the leader of the Free French movement in Shanghai, has been detained on the French gunboat *Cogna* by the French naval authorities here since the 5th of this month. Until 4:30 PM yesterday (the 13th), he was escorted onto the French postal ship *Gindiah* to be tried in Saigon. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the French authorities summoned Aigao's wife and his lawyer, Plume, to the *Cogna*, informing them that Aigao would be leaving Shanghai for Vietnam in a few hours. Half an hour before the *Gindiah* weighed anchor, Aigao was escorted into a small boat and transferred to the *Gindiah*, without allowing Aigao's relatives to board the ship to say goodbye to their loved one.

Another Lawyer Appointed to Defend

Lawyer Plume claimed this morning that he could not go to Vietnam to defend Aigao, but a lawyer in Saigon would fight for Aigao's freedom. It is not yet known whether Aigao will be interrogated by a naval court in Vietnam. The French authorities here said they did not know what kind of interrogation Aigao would undergo after arriving in Vietnam. The headquarters of the Free French movement in this city recently received a telegram from Baron, the Far East representative of General Tegol, criticizing the French Consul in Shanghai, Majeret, for arresting Aigao.

Sudden Escort Surprising

Plume declared yesterday that he would remain in Shanghai unless necessary after Aigao was escorted to Saigon, but he had appointed lawyer Malpom in Saigon to handle the matter. He was shocked by Aigao's sudden escort, and even Aigao himself was quite surprised. He continued that the investigation before the trial would take a long time, perhaps even a year. He said that the facts of the case must be collected in Shanghai.

Free Elements Indignant

The *North-China Daily News* reported that Aigao, the leader of the Tegol movement in this city, was transferred to the French postal ship *Gindiah* yesterday (the 13th) and sailed from Shanghai to Saigon at 5:00 PM. Aigao's defense lawyer said that the French naval authorities have not yet filed a public indictment against Aigao, so the defense statement has not been prepared. When asked if he would go to Saigon to defend his client, he said that this issue had not been discussed, but he might go to Saigon. Although Aigao has not been formally indicted, officials claim that he has induced French naval soldiers to join the Tegol army. However, people who know Aigao deny this, saying that although Aigao is a patriotic activist, he has no ability to induce French naval soldiers to abandon their posts and abscond. The authorities did not issue a formal arrest warrant before Aigao's arrest, which has caused indignation among free movement elements and other foreigners here.

### Capsized Sailing Ship at Jinshanwei: Investigating the Truth: Families of the Victims Can Claim the Bodies: Route to Get There Has Been Determined

On the 9th of this month, more than 200 Ningbo-Shaoxing passengers traveled from Andong across Hangzhou Bay to Zhapu, and then to Shanghai. Because the boat was small and there were too many people, the whole boat capsized when it was nine miles away from Jinshanwei. It is now learned that the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association received a letter from Li Shanming of Jinshanwei and specially sent Shao Xiangqing and Gu Xunzhai of the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Association to go to the scene of the accident to investigate the truth and discuss the follow-up matters. Families of the victims can go to Jinshanwei to claim the bodies. The route from Shanghai to the scene is now reported as follows: Take the No. 2 bus from Edward Road to Hongqiao Road, then hire a rickshaw (the fare is three corners) to the bus station, cross the barbed wire, then take the Minhang long-distance bus (the fare is about one yuan and five corners) to Minhang, walk to the river mouth, cross the river, take the Jinshanwei long-distance bus (the fare is about two yuan and eight corners) and go straight to Jinshanwei Zhong Street. You can ask for the Sen Tai Timber Firm and contact Li Shanming, or hire a car from Xiangtai or Hongkou Bus Company to go directly to the location.

### Small Parcel Mail After Inspection: Should be Handed Over to the Original Bureau for Posting

It is now approved that the Jianghai Customs has notified that all goods samples and small parcels, etc., after being inspected and released by the customs officers stationed in the Administration Bureau, should be handed over to the Administration Bureau window for posting, and should not be handed over to the branch office for posting, in order to avoid the exchange of contents and the breeding of malpractices. It is hereby notified for general knowledge.

### Shen Liwei Narrowly Escapes Being Shot in Front of Jingtu Convent on Guling Road: Someone Attempted to Assassinate Him When Leaving the Convent After Attending a Funeral: Two Shots Fired, Missed, and the Assailant Escaped

Huaguang News Agency reports that Wu and Shanghai gentry Shen Lianfang have long been engaged in the silk industry and can be called leaders in the industry. He is particularly enthusiastic about charity. Recently, due to his old age, he has retired and lives in Shanghai, living as a recluse. His eldest son, Liwei (about 40 years old), is also engaged in the silk industry, but in recent years, the silk industry has gradually declined, so Shen Liwei is seeking other advancements. It is reported that he has recently taken a new position and has a private car. Yesterday at noon, Shen Liwei had a funeral notice from the father of a Wang, manager of the Hengfeng Real Estate Company at 542 Beijing Road. Shen went to pay his respects with a nephew, wearing a blue robe and a black jacket, and had a meal at the company. At about 2:00 PM, the banquet was over, and he was about to step into his private car when two men in blue cloth short shirts and trousers suddenly emerged from the roadside. One of them pulled out a pistol and tried to fire at Shen Liwei. His nephew, who was next to him, saw that things were not good and bravely stepped forward to grab the man's gun-holding hand. The man was anxious and fired two shots at Shen's nephew, both of which hit the hem of his long robe, leaving two holes. Fortunately, he was not injured. The nephew was anxious and let go. The gunman and his companion took the opportunity to escape. At that time, Shen had turned around and ran into the Jingtu Chan Monastery, and immediately reported the incident to the Xinza Patrol Station by telephone. A large number of detectives were dispatched to the scene to investigate, but the gunman had already fled far away. The police are now ordered to conduct a thorough investigation.

### Mao Sheng Foreign Firm Sues Ruifeng Case: American Court Does Not Accept

According to yesterday's news, the case in which the American Mao Sheng Foreign Firm in this city sued Ruifeng Transportation Company has been dismissed by the American Court in China after several adjournments. It is generally expected that the case will be settled out of court. It is understood that the reason why Mao Sheng Foreign Firm sued Ruifeng Company was for negligence of business, causing the plaintiff to lose copper ingots worth three million yuan. This copper ingot was stolen by a Swiss expatriate named Huerte.

### All Sectors Enthusiastically Promote: Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign: Free X-Ray Examinations Will Be Held in All Hospitals in Shanghai Starting Tomorrow

The tuberculosis prevention campaign jointly launched by leaders from all sectors of the city and the New Medicine Industry held a reception for all sectors at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 3:00 PM the other day. Dozens of people, including presidents of hospitals and guests from all sectors, including Chang Wenlan, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xiaochu, and Ding Fubao, attended.

Establish a Foundation, Promote the Country

First, General Secretary Ding Huikang delivered a speech, saying that the greatest significance of the tuberculosis prevention campaign is to eliminate the sick men of East Asia and revive national health. This great work depends on the supervision and promotion of the masses, so that a foundation can be laid, and only then can the day of real success be achieved, and the foundation for national revival also lies here.

Be Aware First, Work Hard to Promote

Then, President Xu gave a speech, saying that the seriousness of the tuberculosis problem in our country is due to the lack of tuberculosis knowledge in society. In addition to the actual work of this session, we especially hope that people from all walks of life who are aware of this will work hard to promote, so that everyone has a deep understanding of tuberculosis prevention, so that the spread of tuberculosis can be gradually reduced, and this tuberculosis prevention campaign can be spread to all parts of the country, which is really the industry of public welfare in the country.

Spitting at Will, Prohibition Should Be Implemented

Lawyer Li Baolin said that a magazine contained an article "A Glimpse of New York", which stated that there were notices in the subway in the United States prohibiting spitting at will, and those who violated it would be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years. Even with the high level of knowledge of the American people, there are still such harsh laws. The general public in our country has the habit of spitting at will, and the danger of spreading germs in the sputum is even greater than that of bombs. For the sake of public safety, it is necessary to promulgate appropriate prohibitions. This is a very important issue in tuberculosis prevention.

Free Check-ups at Major Hospitals

It is now reported that the campaign will be jointly held by major hospitals throughout Shanghai starting tomorrow, offering free X-ray check-ups. At the same time, major pharmacies have designated preferential measures for patients, which is really good news for the city's civilians.

### Young Bandit Zhang Rongfu Robs a Leather Suitcase on the Road, Shot Down and Captured by Patrol

Zhang Rongfu, a native of Ningbo, is 17 years old and was an apprentice in the Huafeng Printing Factory in Hongkou. A month ago, Zhang Rongfu resigned from his job at the printing factory because his income was too low to maintain his livelihood, and made a living by robbery. Yesterday at about 5:00 PM, a Japanese woman was holding a leather suitcase wrapped in newspaper and walking from east to west along the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhili Road. Zhang Rongfu followed behind her and took the opportunity to rob the suitcase and flee. The Japanese woman spoke Chinese and shouted for the arrest of the thief. A Chinese patrolman, No. 1706, nearby heard the noise and rushed to arrest him. Seeing that the bandit was about to escape into Hongmiao Lane, the Chinese patrolman drew his pistol and fired a shot, hitting the bandit's right leg. The bullet went through, and he fell to the ground wounded and was captured. At that time, Zhang Yougen, a 17-year-old apprentice at the Gedexing Woodworking Shop in Hongmiao Lane, who was wiping tables and chairs outside the shop, was also seriously injured in the right foot by a stray bullet. Later, the Chinese patrolman called a car to send Zhang Yougen to Tongren Hospital for treatment, while Zhang Rongfu was sent to the patrolman hospital for treatment.

Resolutions of the Taiwan Disaster Relief Conference

The Taiwan Disaster Relief Conference decided yesterday to send a letter to the American Red Cross to request assistance with American wheat, to send letters to various industries to return the donation registers sent earlier in order to end the work, and that the committee members will sell painting and calligraphy sales tickets, with on-site sales reaching two or three thousand yuan.

### The Gospel of the Poor and Sick

— Qing Ping

A Visit to the Chinese Health Association

Progressive medical professionals, sympathizing with the poor and sick, have created medical organizations and health institutions for the sake of human health, which are emerging with considerable momentum. The Chinese Health Association is one of the most well-managed and diligent of these organizations. They truly serve society, relieve the suffering of patients, and promote public health knowledge as their duty. The doctors are all very experienced and dedicated experts. This prompted me to visit them.

On a Thursday afternoon, I invited Mr. Huang and his brothers, Jiade and Jiayin, from the Xifeng News Agency to accompany me on a visit. The Chinese Health Association is located at 41 Chih Ham Road, right at the intersection of Avenue Road, making transportation quite convenient. This building was built by the Chinese Medical Association. The Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Health Association are essentially two sides of the same coin. The Chinese Medical Association is academic, with the aim of improving medical endeavors and promoting health education. The Chinese Health Association is technical, handling health affairs, directly serving patients, and promoting human health. This building is not a tall Western-style mansion. Observing its exterior, one would be surprised and disbelieve that it is a treasure trove of the nation's medical community and the site of doctors treating patients with such urgency. We saw a wealth of ancient medical literature and medical journals from various countries (this will be discussed separately).

In a simply furnished reception room, we met Dr. Ouyang Zhong, the Director-General of the Chinese Health Association; Mr. Wang Jimin, a senior figure in the medical community, who is the medical affairs secretary of the Chinese Medical Association, president of the Chinese Medical History Association, and professor at the National Medical College; Dr. Yu Xinen, who recently returned from his studies last year. Dr. Yu has profound research on pulmonary tuberculosis and is currently the editor of the Chinese Health Magazine; and Miss He Zhuxuan, the head of the membership group of the Chinese Health Association and head of the public experimental area nurse department. They told me about the organization, work, and facilities of the Chinese Health Association.

Although the Chinese Health Association was officially established in Shanghai only on July 1st of last year, in terms of actual work, it already has several years of history. This organization is composed of doctors enthusiastic about social welfare, public health experts, and Minghui workers. Many important medical groups and health institutions, such as the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association, the Chinese Venereal Disease Prevention Association, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, the Shanghai Birth Control Research Society, the Chinese Child Welfare Association, the Chinese Women's Association, the Chinese Dental Association, the Red Cross, the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Science Society, etc., all have representatives participating. It includes many units and can actually be said to be a joint organization of the above groups.

The current directors of the association are: President Dr. Zhu Heng (Acting President of Shanghai Medical College), Vice President Dr. Diao Xinde (President of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association), Treasurer Dr. Fu Wenshou (President of the Nutritional Promotion Association), Secretary Shi Siming (Director-General of the Chinese Medical Association), Dr. Hai Shende (President of Shanghai Lung Hospital), Dr. Wang Shuzhen (President of Shanghai Ximen Women and Children's Hospital), Shen Jiying (Secretary of the Shanghai Birth Control Guidance Center), Zhou Chenghu (Director of Ophthalmology at Shanghai Medical College), Zheng Quan, Dentist (President of the Chinese Dental Association). In addition, the executive staff are: Director of the Propaganda Group Dr. Huang Huiguang (Physician for Women and Children's Health at the Clinic), Head of the Membership Group Miss He Zhuxuan (Head Public Health Nurse), Director of the Public Health Experimental Area Dr. Huang Huaixin, Director-General Dr. Ouyang Zhong (Physician of the General Medicine and Leprosy Department of the Clinic).

The mission of the Chinese Health Association is "to make the public feel the importance of health, and to make China a first-class country in terms of health and physique." The association's current main work is concentrated in the Xin Zha Public Health Experimental Area. This experimental area has already achieved excellent results under the leadership of the Chinese Medical Association in the past few years. Their work can be divided into two parts: one is the establishment of clinics, and the second is the nurse training and service of the public health nurse department; the two parts work closely together to achieve the greatest effect. The clinic is divided into nine departments: tuberculosis, ophthalmology, venereal diseases, maternal and child health, birth control, dentistry, and general medicine. Each department is headed by specialized physicians with profound medical knowledge and a spirit of service. The area of this Xin Zha Experimental Area is bounded by Avenue Road to the north, Suzhou Creek to the south, Chengdu Road to the west, and Carter Road to the east. At least 80 percent of the residents in this area are poor people; it is actually a slum, so their health is a problem and they cannot afford treatment when they get sick. Therefore, it is very meaningful that the Chinese Health Association has chosen this area as an experimental area. So these clinics are aimed at people in the middle and lower classes. Consultation fees and medical expenses are very low; the initial consultation requires a registration fee of one dime, and follow-up consultations are five cents each. If they are indeed extremely poor and unable to pay, they can receive free treatment, and even medicines are given away for free. Their main purpose is to indicate and teach the importance of disease prevention. In addition to providing necessary treatment to those who come for treatment, doctors or nurses also tell them the prevention methods for various diseases and general health knowledge, and nurses are sent to visit patients' homes to provide appropriate help and advice.

The work of the Public Health Nurse Department is divided into the outpatient department and the home visit department, which is headed by Miss He Zhuxuan, who is smart, capable, and experienced. Miss He has several virtues such as a strong physique, gentle temperament, and enthusiasm for service, which are suitable for her to undertake this arduous and difficult work. There are currently eight nurses. These young ladies are all graduates of nursing schools and have undergone special training. Everyone embraces the spirit of obedience and sacrifice and works hard. Therefore, although the number of people is small, they have made many commendable achievements. In addition to assisting in the diagnostic work and various examinations in the outpatient department, their most important work is health education. In this regard, they: hold lectures for waiting patients on various health knowledge and the importance and methods of disease prevention; conduct individual talks with patients to investigate social and health issues related to them and help them solve various difficulties; instill family health and maternal and child health knowledge in women seeking treatment; organize children's associations. The participants are all schoolchildren in the area who have no opportunity to attend school. They teach health knowledge and train hygienic habits, and also teach them to sing, arithmetic, literacy, and writing, so that these unfortunate children also have the opportunity to experience the life of kindergarten and elementary school. At ordinary times, nurses make home visits at any time to urge these children to practice hygienic habits.

Although the work of the Chinese Health Association focuses on this experimental area, in fact, they are not limited to this scope. If poor people outside the area need medical and health assistance, the staff in the area are also treated equally and are happy to serve. They treat these poor people, and not only do they not charge the patients expensive consultation fees, but they also have to assist the Public Works Bureau's health department in discovering people with leprosy and forcibly send them to the leprosy clinic affiliated with the Health Association's expanded clinic for diagnosis and treatment, because currently Shanghai only has this one clinic specializing in leprosy. In this situation, the concession authorities seem to should provide them with a large amount of funding, but in fact the Public Works Bureau only subsidizes them with 500 yuan per year. The leaders of the Health Association have repeatedly asked the Public Works Bureau to increase the subsidy, but the result is that the Public Works Bureau is financially exhausted and has no effect. Therefore, although the Chinese Health Association undertakes social work for national health, their funding is very tight. In the past, they relied on donations from local public groups and individuals. Currently, due to the war, the source of funding is gradually decreasing. It is said that Mr. Feng Bingnan and others, who are enthusiastic about social welfare, are trying to raise funds for them. The association itself is also actively recruiting members in order to strengthen its foundation and develop its work. In fact, it only charges each member an annual membership fee of two yuan, and the benefits it gives to each member include: receiving a health badge, receiving a health record, receiving a free subscription to the Chinese Health Magazine for the whole year, free physical examinations, free vaccinations, and free vaccinations, which are several times the membership fee paid. I think people in the community will be happy to support and actively participate. (End)

### Chief Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun's Residence Suddenly Visited by a Strange Guest Xiang Was Not Home and No Accident Occurred More Guards to Protect Court Personnel

Xiang Zhejun, the chief prosecutor of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, lives at No. 48, Lane 445, 　　　Metcalfe Road. His residence is guarded by two Chinese detectives dispatched by the Public Works Bureau Police Department. Since Yu Hua, the criminal court president of the Second Branch of the High Court, and Qian Hongye, the criminal court president of the First Special Court, were assassinated one after another, and Xu Weizhen, the president of the Second Branch of the High Court, was kidnapped recently, Xiang has moved to the First Special Court on North Zhejiang Road, where more detectives dispatched by the police station guard him day and night.

Attending for Protection

His residence is still guarded by detectives dispatched by the Gordon Road police station. However, at about 12 o'clock late the day before, five strong men in Zhongshan suits suddenly arrived in a car and sped to the entrance of Lane 445 on Metcalfe Road and got out of the car. Two of them each took out a box cannon and intimidated the gatekeeper No. 2548, seized his weapon, and monitored him. Then they went to the back door of No. 48, first telling the two Chinese detectives No. 296 and No. 420 who were stationed to guard them, and took away two rows of bullets from their pistols, and then entered the house and searched it. Their purpose was because it was a weekday last night, Xiang would definitely go home to live, so

Planning to Kidnap

However, Xiang did not go home that day and still lived in the court. Therefore, after searching the house, they did not find Xiang's whereabouts. They took the seized bullets and other items and fled without a trace in the original car. After the detectives reported to the Gordon Road police station, they immediately ordered a large number of detectives to rush to investigate. Afterwards, the police station authorities, in addition to ordering all police stations to be vigilant, also dispatched more detectives to strictly protect Xiang and other important court personnel to avoid a recurrence of the same incident.

### Dr. Wei Dan's Great Success in Shanghai

Dr. Wei Dan's newly invented method of nasal tip contact therapy has been very effective since the consultation. The first day of consultation was very enthusiastic, and in these ten days, there was a steady stream of people, with the势 to be overwhelming.

Anyone who has been treated by the doctor for the first time feels that the effect of this new method is miraculous and can bring back the dead. In this week, especially those suffering from asthma, the effect is even faster. Every time someone has suffered from this disease for many years, the disease disappears after the first operation, which is even more amazing.

As for rheumatism, bone pain, stomach disease, and neurasthenia, there are many people who have been cured by the doctor. There are also those who have been depressed and rejuvenated after treatment. There are also children with delayed development, dull intelligence, and nervous sensitivity who have also been cured. From this point of view, the doctor's new treatment method, although very simple, has remarkable effects, and everyone thinks that Bian Que is reborn. According to Dr. Wei Dan's new method, a small metal rod is used to contact the nerve points of the mucous membrane in the nose. The patient does not feel any pain, but the face is rosy, the eyes are moist, and occasionally sneezing indicates that the patient has a good response to the treatment. Dr. Wei Dan has restored the normal function of the patient's sympathetic major nerve.

Dr. Wei Dan has only opened a clinic in Shanghai for a short time, but this miraculous effect is not accidental, but because Dr. Wei Dan had already seen the effect when he opened a sympathetic major nerve sanatorium in Paris. Based on the results obtained from 10,000 consultations, there is the following table A

Asthma 88% Irritability and Fainting 79% Insomnia 84% Neurasthenia 82% Headache 80% Nerve Sensitivity 78% Stomach Disease 90% Rheumatism 77% Neuralgia 81% Nervous Tension 78% Throat Symptoms 60% Bronchitis 90% Dysentery 65% Hemiplegia 50% Other Paralysis 30% Menstrual Disease 78% Brain Nerves and Premature Aging 90% The above statistics do not need to be explained, which proves that Dr. Wei Dan's success today is not accidental. I sincerely hope that Dr. Wei Dan will not leave Shanghai so that patients can seek help and get out of the sea of suffering. Check that Dr. Wei Dan is currently living in Room 707 of the Hwa Da Hotel on the Bund. Consultation hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM (closed on Saturday afternoon and Sunday)

It is known that Dr. Wei Dan will broadcast a speech on the English 大美 Evening News Radio at 8:05 PM on Friday, April 18 (XMHC frequency 700)

### 修學講座 How to Study Chinese Literature (5)

— Xue Wu Jing

Excerpt: Life is finite, but books are infinite. Reading without remembering, or remembering without understanding, is futile. How much more so for those of average intelligence who merely skim the surface, forgetting as they read. The remedy is to make excerpts. For example, Gu Tinglin often said, "Good reading is not as good as good copying." His "Daily Knowledge Records" and "Eastern Study Notes" were all compiled from continuous excerpts. A friend of mine categorized and copied idioms from "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" and dictionaries, eventually forming a volume that he could easily reference and use. Another student, whose Chinese grades were initially ordinary, improved remarkably in a short time. It turned out that over three years, he had excerpted and categorized phrases into ten volumes, similar to the composition dictionaries available in bookstores. While this may not be the best method for studying Chinese literature, it cultivates a habit of paying attention while reading, which is not without merit.

Index Cards: This method imitates library cataloging. Record the title, volume, page number, time, and author of articles from newspapers and magazines, whether they discuss issues or express opinions, on index cards. Categorize them according to their content and store them in custom-made drawers with small compartments. When researching a topic or writing an article, you can easily check them, synthesize, and analyze the information. With a wealth of material, a little organization can lead to a magnificent article. Others may think you have read thousands of books and write with divine inspiration, but it all relies on these small cards that manage your daily reading, allowing you to select information easily, saving time and effort, and preventing confusion. This aligns with the principle of effortless action.

Recitation: Vernacular Chinese may not require recitation, but prose does. While prose might not require recitation, poetry absolutely does. The structure of an article, in essence, requires attention to both its ideas and content, and to its form. Not only poetry and songs have rhythm; prose also possesses a natural rhythm. For example, "Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger, and the sage arises and all things are seen," or "Vague and indistinct, there is something within; elusive and indistinct, there is an image within." Are there not natural rhythms between the phrases? Some students write in a rambling, disorganized manner because they do not read enough, or they read without paying attention to the neatness of the phrases, the euphony of the sounds, and the grandeur of the style. Naturally, they cannot grasp the essence of writing. For example, the fluency of Mencius, the conciseness of Han Feizi, the unrestrainedness of Zhuangzi, the surging repetition of Han Yu, and the graceful variety of Ouyang Xiu, cannot be understood without loud recitation, which allows one to appreciate their masculine and feminine beauty.

Chanting: Chinese characters are formed from individual elements. The reason poetry and songs have harmonious rhythms and become beautiful compositions is that they contain many compound words, alliterations, assonances, or reduplicated words, combined with the changes of the four tones (level, rising, departing, entering) and the distinctions of the four phonetic openings (open, close, combined, contracted). Thus, what enters the ear has the wonders of high and low, fast and slow, soft and loud, and rising and falling. Talented individuals throughout history have grasped this intuitively, creating many immortal works. Even the tyranny of Qin Shi Huang and the overbearing nature of the Chu霸 King could not be completely burned away by a wildfire. In the Nineteen Old Poems, words like "青青," "盈盈," "皎皎," "娥娥," and "織織" are all reduplicated. Li Qingzhao's composition, "尋尋覓覓, 冷冷清清, 淒淒慘慘戚戚" uses reduplicated words throughout. Words with the same pronunciation are called alliterations, and words with the same rhyme are called assonances. Examples include "窈窕," "勉, 踟躕," "邂逅," "沮," "……" Just flip through the "经," and they are everywhere. If we do not chant these types of poems aloud, how can we know their divinity and subtle beauty?

In the Sino-Western Cup table tennis competition, at 8 PM the night before last, the Jewish team played against the defending runner-up Women's Youth team in the Youth Association auditorium. Zhu Shangxin, a key player for the Women's Youth, had unfortunately gone to Hong Kong the day before. Fang Xiuwen, Wang Guangmei, and Zhang Dexin were also absent due to various reasons, greatly weakening their strength. The Jewish team, on the other hand, came with their full force, especially Madam Di Fei, whose chop shots were incredibly beautiful and effortlessly defeated four players from the Women's Youth team. As a result, the Jewish women defeated the Women's Youth with a score of 13 to 6, raising their hopes for the championship of this year's women's group. The Women's Youth team's lineup was scattered, so how could they not lose? This loss was equivalent to giving up their hopes of winning the championship, which is truly regrettable. Tonight, there will be another match, with the Hualian Women's team playing against the Women's Youth team in the women's group. Both teams were the champion and runner-up of the previous year, so it is sure to be exciting.

As a result, Yang narrowly won with a score of three to two. At that time, both sides had the same score, and a three-game tiebreaker was held. The tension of the competition was unprecedented.

### Le You Small Ball Defeats Mei Zui Shi

The Le You Sports Association's small football team played a friendly match against Mei Zui Shi yesterday morning at 10:30 AM. The battle was exceptionally exciting. In the first half, both sides defended tightly, and neither side scored. After the break, Le You launched a major attack, and Mei Zui Shi gradually became unable to withstand it. The Le You forwards took advantage of the situation and scored two consecutive goals. Although Mei Zui Shi attempted to counterattack, they ultimately succumbed to Le You with a score of two to zero due to the expiration of the allotted time.

Education

### Democracy or Dictatorship?

— Pan Li

Students in the social studies class at George School in Pennsylvania, USA, expressed doubts about the democratic way of life, believing that democratic systems were too inefficient. They believed that dictatorships were more efficient.

Teacher McFee had difficulty refuting this, so he said, "Well then, the only way to resolve the question of the merits of democracy versus dictatorship is through practical experimentation. For the sake of experimentation, this class will implement a dictatorship for the next two weeks." As a result, discussion was prohibited in the classroom, questions were not allowed, and severe punishments were imposed on those who barely passed. In addition, McFee organized a small secret police force, assigning four students to act as secret police, secretly listening to what students said outside of class and recording it. Then, one day, McFee suddenly read aloud in public a list of students' private criticisms of him and other teachers, rumors they had asked about, and violations of rules. The students were all shocked and surprised when they heard this, and they began to feel the ugliness of dictatorship. Thus, on the fifth day of implementing the dictatorship, all the students unanimously demanded the restoration of democracy.

Although this is just an amusing anecdote, it is not without considerable significance and lesson.

### Camouflage in Nature

— Jian Chen

Assuming that camouflage is "a military technique aimed at concealing the true nature of one's own movements, so as to passively evade enemy attacks and actively facilitate attacking the enemy," as military experts define it, then there are countless precedents in nature, but the designer is nature. So camouflage is a set of tricks that we humans are best at copying!

Color Change

In nature, the state of war is constant: weak animals cannot but rely on protective coloration to eke out a living, such as grasshoppers in the grass being green, and winter hares being white; while fierce creatures, like the brown lions in the African desert, and the white polar bears on the Arctic ice, also happily don coats of fur that blend in with their surroundings, so as to ambush and snatch prey. This cannot help but remind one of the uniforms of soldiers in plains countries, which mostly use gray or green, while the uniforms of Finnish soldiers resisting the Soviet Union the year before last were precisely snow-white! As for all kinds of animals that can rapidly change color at any time and in any place, such as octopuses, cuttlefish, isopods, and the most famous lizards, perhaps they can be compared to the actions of those spies who are fickle and constantly changing, and who can disguise themselves as all sorts of people!

Mimicry

There is an insect called the "dead leaf butterfly," which gets its name from the fact that when it is tired of flying and resting, it closes its wings together, hiding its bright colors, and the colors and veins on the outside completely resemble a dead leaf. There are very many other animals that can do mimicry. I think that during the last European war, in order to detect the German army's movements, the Allied forces moved the statue in front of a church bell tower on a hillside at night, replacing it with a completely identical statue that had been prefabricated, but was hollow in the middle to allow observers to hide; and there were also all sorts of actions, such as disguising dead trees, disguising dead horses, and disguising warships as merchant ships, in order to confuse the enemy, which can be categorized under this example.

Imitation

There is a kind of sand crab near the coast that likes to bite seaweed and attach it to its back or legs. The seaweed continues to grow, and soon it becomes a moving botanical garden. There is also a kind of "hermit crab," which puts its soft tail into the empty shell of a clam snail, and then takes one or two sea anemones on its back and swims slowly. If we look at this, isn't it an epitome of those tanks or armored vehicles covered with crisscrossing branches? There is also a bird called the chaffinch, which can disguise its nest with moss and lichen, making it difficult for people to recognize. During wartime, most of the positions, gun emplacements, and command posts were all supported by fishnets covered with green branches and leaves, confusing the enemy and making it impossible to tell whether they were real forests or fake forests; isn't this kind of behavior the same as the chaffinch?

Amulets

The cuttlefish can spew ink like releasing a smokescreen, as mentioned earlier. In the Italian coastal area, there is also a type of squid called Heteroteuthis: it can release a kind of luminous secretion from a special gland, surrounding itself, as if wrapped in a "fiery cloud"! Let us take these two things as a metaphor for the actions of those warships currently fighting in the Mediterranean: either using smoke bombs to confuse the enemy's target, or releasing searchlights to frighten the invading enemy planes!

False Death

Some animals, like sand fleas, paramecia, a certain kind of dung beetle, and hedgehogs, immediately curl up into a ball when they encounter danger, not moving at all, as if they were dead, so as to prevent the enemy from paying attention and treat them as inanimate objects such as stones and gravel. I remember that in the last European war, a submarine was being fiercely pursued by the enemy, and it was difficult to escape from the encirclement safely. The driver suddenly had a whimsical idea, deliberately opened the gasoline tank, and scattered the oil. As a result, a bright wave full of oil marks floated on the sea surface. The enemy thought that they had already hit it, and no longer needed to waste artillery shells. The driver's trick worked, and he safely left the tiger's mouth!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(Six) Crystallization of Love

What made her most difficult was actually the return of her father as before, and the sudden return of her brother together from the north, going to the Western Hills to recuperate; because at first her father had said that he was not used to that kind of "living off of his brother-in-law," and planned to use the several thousand dollars he had obtained from Yuan Baofan to take to Hangzhou, on the one hand to treat his son's lung disease, and on the other hand to find a place to settle down in the south, no longer returning to Tianjin. Who knew that upon arriving in Hangzhou, he would run into his brother-in-law who had quit his original job at the Zhejiang Provincial Office, wanting to go to Guangzhou to be the director of the telegraph bureau, and at the same time Dr. Fei of the Geling Sanatorium - the doctor who had always treated Xiangqi's brother and had already achieved some progress in his treatment - was also about to return to the United States due to the expiration of his contract, and before leaving he solemnly recommended a hospital in the Western Hills outside Beijing to them, so the Luo family father and son actually returned to the north together, adding two major burdens to Xiangqi, and she no longer dared to think about the idea of running away.

But staying in the Yuan family, even if Yuan Baofan didn't suspect anything in his heart, how could she stay herself? After the baby was born, did she really intend to recognize Old Yuan as the father?

But the swelling of her abdomen no longer allowed her to delay, and she had no choice but to temporarily let Yuan Baofan take some advantage, pretending to be very serious and telling him the good news, barely easing the situation.

This was naturally an even more overwhelming matter in the heart of Autumn Begonia. On the one hand, he had to worry about Xiangqi, fearing that someone would tell Yuan Baofan the truth before she gave birth; on the other hand, he couldn't help but feel anxious for himself, fearing that after the child was born, it would be taken away by Yuan Baofan, and he would become a stranger who would never know him.

Although his thinking was not stubborn, although his age was very young, and thoughts of "lineage issues" and "succession issues" had not yet entered his brain, he could not change his personality! He was someone who liked children the most, and in his eyes, none of the children in the world were not lively and adorable little angels; moreover, this future little angel was the crystallization of his and Xiangqi's love! Asking him to willingly give him up was really an impossible thing. (81)

### The Stone Statue of Time

— Zhu Xu

Many people imagine that time is an old man, but how can time be an old man? Time will not grow old, it is you yourself who will grow old. So what is time? Time is an unfinished stone statue.

No one knows where this stone came from - do you know how time came about? It is probably a precious stone, and its texture must be very hard. It stands in a place that everyone in the world has to pass through, and once they have passed through, that person will not return; so every person, once they have passed through, picks up the chisel left by their predecessors and carves on it. A lazy person carves a stroke and leaves; but a diligent person refuses to put down the chisel until he cannot breathe; an unfortunate person dies before even getting close to it; but a mediocre person cannot carve a single mark. The stone is covered with knife marks, and countless people have passed through. Alas! What an arduous and long-lasting task this is!

But it never becomes a completed stone statue.

Its ears are carved out by itself, but there is only a rough outline; its hands and feet have been revealed, but they are still a blurry segment. It is almost the same as when it came.

How could the people of the past not have worked hard enough? Someone is complaining. Is complaining right? We cannot blame the past, we should blame ourselves for not working hard enough. How much more greedy for ease and lazy we are in our lives! Supposing we live to be sixty years old, we seem to be sleeping in bed for sixty years, constantly dreaming, and before long we have all become the past, without having made a single stroke on the stone statue.

The people of the past did work hard, and those rough lines are precisely the symbols of their work. Some of them are geniuses, some of them are heroes, some of them are good people who only leave their work and not their names... In short, they carved difficult lines on the stone statue of time with their respective abilities. They are indeed better than us, how can we continue to waste our time? Work is indeed difficult, sometimes it requires breaking the tiger's mouth, sweating profusely, and aching hands and feet, but if you fight it, carve a few strokes on it, then glory will be yours.

Time is a stone statue that will never be completed.

So let's work wholeheartedly, you who are working! Will you pass the stone statue of time silently, or will you contribute your share of work and receive universal praise? You have probably understood, so strike your chisel hard, you only have this precious one time.

Time is a stone statue that will not be completed, but it hopes to become a masterpiece. What kind of exquisite work of art will an unfinished masterpiece be! A masterpiece requires your conscience, passion, and character; if you are a lowly and evil person, you cannot participate in the work, because time's record is history, upright and unyielding. How will you work in today's era?

### The Place of Intoxication

— Xue Li

Intoxication is the happiest thing in the world. When we are intoxicated in a certain place, we completely forget everything in the universe. The saying "Three cups and no ten thousand things, one drunk resolves a thousand sorrows" describes this state.

We find comfort and feel satisfied in the place of intoxication. We would rather pay a heavy price to exchange for a moment of intoxication. Everyone in the world has their own place of intoxication. Seeing their respective places of intoxication can reveal their character and predict their future.

Where is the best place of intoxication? Not in the dance hall, not in the gambling den, but in the garden of academia. When mathematicians are writing their straight lines and circles, and chemists are pouring their sulfuric acid and alcohol, their entire souls are intoxicated here, fulfilling them.

The value of academia, at least from this aspect of providing a place for intoxication, is already infinite.

Random Notes from the Chrysanthemum Garden

### On "The Joint Trial of Three Officials"

— Ji

According to Cao Xinquan, "The Joint Trial of Three Officials" is originally a Xiaosheng (young male role) Zheng Gong (major performance) opera. Xu Xiaoxiang loved to sing this opera the most, and Tan Xinpei often accompanied him as Liu Bingyi, wearing purple official robes instead of blue official robes. Now, Liu Bingyi is commonly referred to as "Blue Robe," which is actually a mistake. It was only after the protagonist in this opera changed from Xiaosheng to Dan (female role) that the opera "Yu Tang Chun" was discovered. It is said that the opera "Yu Tang Chun" originated from the Bangzi Opera troupe. I have not seen the Bangzi "Yu Tang Chun," but I have seen Luo Xiaobao and Xiao Baisui's "Su San Qi Jie" (Su San Being Escorted) taken at Wang Yaoqing's house. At that time, Luo Xiaobao had not yet changed to Laosheng (old male role), and Su San's attire was Qingyi (virtuous woman role), with small-footed trousers and stilt shoes. Li Zhangren Yu Zeng once said that Yu Ziyun's "Joint Trial of Three Officials" was very famous, and the opera "Yu Tang Chun" originated from Ziyun. Ziyun played Yu Tang Chun on stilts, indicating that the old-style "Yu Tang Chun" female roles all wore stilt shoes. Two years ago, the newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin argued for a long time about the appropriate role for Su San. One side said that it should be played by a Huadan (vivacious young female role), while the other side advocated for a Qingyi opera. In fact, the role of Su San should be performed by a Guimen Dan (young unmarried woman role), similar to Jin Yunu in "Beating the Unfaithful Lover with a Stick" and Dongfang Shi in "Hongni Pass." Having a Huadan sing it loses her status; having a Qingyi play it does not suit her position; both are incorrect. In the past thirty years, many experts have regarded it as a Huadan opera, so the mournful play is performed with seductive expressions. "Yu Tang Chun took his name from a nobleman," "Sixteen years old...Young Master Wang," "Let's reminisce about old times under the altar," "Yu Tang Chun is like the stamen of a flower..." These lines are all Su San's tragic history. Mentioning this matter is truly "past events too painful to recall." How sorrowful and poignant should it be? But the female performers who sing this today, none of them are not timid, affected, shy, and smiling. Under the imposing and stern questioning of the three officials, being so frightened as to only want to escape death, what shame is there to be afraid of, what affectation to make, why be shy, and how dare one smile flirtatiously? At this time, Su San uses the word "loneliness" to win the sympathy of the three officials, not to seduce them with her looks. The root of the error is that the actors do not understand the personality of the role they are playing. If they can carefully understand Yu Tang Chun's status and situation, there will naturally be no lightly frowning and smiling performances.

The old-style Wang Jingjiang had a written statement, but now, except for Jiang Miaoxiang, it has been omitted. Liu Bingyi, in the past, Li Shunting and Shen Sanyuan also wore red official robes, but now they all wear blue official robes. I have seen Gao Qingkui, Tan Xiaopei, Ma Lianliang, Zhou Xinfang, Zhang Chunyan, and Bao Jixiang perform it, and they were all excellent. Liu Jingran and Lei Xifu's Pan Bizheng (Cheng Yanqiu originally called Zhou Jiliang) can also be called absolutely superb. The late Wang Rongsen was also considered a talented performer of this role in the South. Su San not wearing stilt shoes, but changing to colored shoes, and changing the Qingyi to crime clothes and trousers, plus a waist-cinching skirt, is said to have been the first by Wang Yaoqing; Mei Lanfang was the first to learn from Wang. Logically, Su "is a criminal who murdered her husband, and there is a need to wear crime clothes and trousers. At the same time, Su San needs to wear stilt shoes. When "watching the severe torture being served," now they all raise one big foot, which is really not as good-looking as wearing stilt shoes.

### Theater News

— Juexin

Chen Hefeng and Yun Yanxia of Tianchan Stage are about to leave after completing the thirteen episodes of Jin Biao Huang Tianba. Originally, Tianchan had already invited the civil and military Laosheng Zhang Yunlou to fill his vacancy. On the one hand, they also asked Xin Xin Stage to borrow the female Dan Mao Jianqiu for a short-term performance from April 16th to May 11th. However, due to the issue of billing, Zhang Yunlou expressed his unwillingness to do it again, and the Tianchan authorities did not retain him. After discussion by the drama department, Gao Xueqiao was assigned to play the role of Huang Tianba in the fourteen episodes of the new play.

The Three Episodes of the Strange Hero Ouyang De at the Gong Stage has begun rehearsals after the play was completed the night before last. All the actors participated overnight. "Singing and dancing" scenes have been added, and Xuan Gang is still hired as the professor. In terms of roles, Zhao Ruquan plays Ouyang De from beginning to end, Liu Hanchen plays both Su Yonglu and Cai Qing, Wang Shaolou plays Xu Sheng in the first part and Liu Detai in the second part, and Li Ruchun plays Gao Tonghai in the first part and Wu Jie in the second part. As for the date of the premiere, it has not been determined yet, but it is not far away.

### Before the Premiere of Hong Xuanjiao

— Wei Ruhui

The historical drama of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, "Hong Xuanjiao," is being premiered. The production of this script during the writing process of the "Southern Ming Historical Drama" four kinds was entirely unexpected for me. Although I had thought about writing a play about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom centered on Hong Xuanjiao before the war, all the historical materials of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom I had collected over the years were taken by Han Sheng to write "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom," so it was just a passing thought.

This time, the China Traveling Drama Troupe is premiering at the Lyceum Theatre. Ruo Qing, hoping for a new script, came to force me to write it for her in a swift and decisive manner. I felt very hesitant because my interest in the past few months has been entirely in "bibliography," and there are still several scripts that I have promised to write but have not yet submitted. But in the end, I couldn't resist her "continuous forcing," and I had to agree to write "Hong Xuanjiao."

Hong Xuanjiao is the most outstanding of the female heroes in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. She is rich in nationalistic thought, is a brave general, and is skilled in medicine, able to treat wounded soldiers. In politics, she is also a resourceful person. Her mind is very clear. When she discovers that Xiuquan and his gang are corrupt, complacent, and engaged in infighting and cannot be with them, she "retires to a folk residence," and even "the ministers and nuns" "cannot stop her." Her character is also very decisive. Therefore, Hong Xuanjiao's life and its changes are completely in line with the growth and destruction of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

The failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom did not begin after arriving in Tianjing. Hong Daquan, the leader of the "Restoration of the Ming Dynasty" faction, was arrested and killed in Hunan, and Xiuquan slaughtered the "Restoration of the Ming Dynasty Party" in the army to weaken their power, which is the first reason. Secondly, after arriving in Tianjing, they became corrupt, complacent, and did not think about progress. Thirdly, the leading kings killed each other, and the national clan and powerful ministers framed the loyal and good. The economic system could not be established, and the people's suffering was not alleviated first, which was of course the basis for failure. Other factors, such as the different origins and perceptions of the kings and the failure to utilize international relations, also had a significant impact.

I have tried my best to explain these factors in the main line and in the development of the plot, based on historical facts. I hope to paint a clearer picture of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The regret is that the premiere date is too close, and I was unable to fully prepare. I only spent ten days reading historical materials and writing the play. I hope to have the opportunity to revise it again.

Thank you, Mr. Fei Mu, for your enthusiastic direction.

Chapter 6 Temporary Drunkenness Beside the Beautiful Woman's Zither

After saying this, she smiled slightly at Li Xin and leaned her head into Li Xin's arms. She also said, "Although I am the daughter of a green forest, I have always kept myself chaste and am not a licentious person. Don't look down on me. Now that I am serving the young master and sleeping with him, if the young master wants to abandon me again, I will have no face to live in this world anymore. I am willing to borrow a three-foot-long sword and die by the young master's side." As Hong Niangzi said this, tears had already dripped from her clear eyes. Li Xin listened to Hong Niangzi's words and felt that she was very gentle and tactful, and he suddenly realized that all the previous experiences were due to Hong Niangzi's love. Seeing her sometimes frowning slightly, sometimes smiling lightly, although she is a female bandit, she is so gentle and charming that she is lovely. Who would know that she is a female demon on the battlefield? Li Xin thought this way. After all, he is not a callous man. Now his heart is gradually wavering. No matter what hero or heroine, as long as his heart moves, he will be unable to make up his mind and lose his integrity. Therefore, Li Xin's heart was originally as hard as stone, but after Hong Niangzi did this, it naturally softened. It was not until the sun was high in the sky that the lovers' dream finally awoke. The two of them put on their clothes and got out of bed, smiling at each other. After a while, Li Xin saw Tong Tianbao, but he couldn't help but feel a little ashamed on his face. When Tong Tianbao saw that Li Xin had already succumbed, he secretly admired his sister's ingenious design and invited Li Xin to be the second leader. Li Xin had no choice but to agree. After Hong Niangzi shared the joys of love with Li Xin, she stayed with him day and night, thinking that she had obtained a handsome talent, and her heart was very happy, spending sweet time. Before they knew it, it had been almost a month. However, Li Xin's loss of himself as a bandit was all attracted by the magic of Hong Niangzi. Although he had fun on the mountain every night, and spent his days in the arms of love, his heart could not help but still remember his hometown, and he was unwilling to be buried in the mountains and forests for a long time. Therefore, he still wanted to escape from the bandit den and return to Qixian to be a good citizen. But Hong Niangzi guarded him every day, never leaving him, so there was no opportunity to become a bird out of a cage. It just so happened that one day Tong Tianbao led the bandits down the mountain to attack a certain city, wanting to join forces with Li Zicheng's band of rebels, so the mountain was very empty.
