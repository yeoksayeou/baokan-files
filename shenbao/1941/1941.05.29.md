### U.S. President's Broadcast Speech Yesterday Morning: Declares Unlimited National Emergency

States that the U.S. will Definitely Fight if Attacked, Protecting the Provision of Additional Aid to the Government of China

Washington – President Roosevelt addressed the nation and the world last night, delivering a highly anticipated and important speech, declaring that an unlimited national emergency now exists. President Roosevelt stated resolutely that the United States will definitely fight if attacked. The President also reiterated that the United States will fulfill its promise to provide supplies to democracies. He said, "We have guaranteed material assistance to other democracies in the world, and we will fulfill this guarantee. We in the Americas will decide if, when, and where our American interests are attacked or our national security is threatened. We are now placing our armed forces in strategically important positions. We will not hesitate to use these armed forces to repel attacks against us. Given the current state of the world, should the United States hesitate to adopt all the plans necessary to maintain our American freedom? I have issued a declaration on this matter. Our people and government will not hesitate to confront this challenge. We reaffirm the inherent principle of maritime freedom of the United States. If not for two secret factors, Hitler's plan to dominate the world would have been close to success. What are these two factors? They are the heroic resistance of Great Britain and the valiant defense of China. Some may think the U.S. has not been attacked until bombs fall on New York or San Francisco. But know that any base that threatens our security, once dominated, will be the start of an attack on the U.S. The Axis powers will never achieve their goal of world domination unless they first gain maritime power. This is their greatest goal today. To gain maritime power, they must first conquer Great Britain before they can powerfully advance into the Western Hemisphere. If the Axis powers fail to gain maritime power, they will inevitably fail. That is why they are willing to risk everything to try to break through the maritime power plan."

### The U.S. Dispatches More Warships and Aircraft to Strengthen Naval Patrol Strength

The U.S. President continued, "The Battle of the Atlantic has now extended to the mid-Atlantic. Germany's most significant attacks are directed at the northern route through which U.S. aid to Britain passes. Germany seeks to occupy Iceland and Greenland, as these two places are stepping stones to Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, and will then invade the northern part of the United States itself, including vital industrial areas. Similarly, if the Azores and Cape Verde Islands are occupied by Germany, it will directly endanger the freedom of the Atlantic and the security of the Americas themselves. Under German control, these islands would become bases from which submarines, warships, and aircraft could launch attacks on areas off the U.S. coast and shipping in the South Atlantic, threatening the integrity and independence of the U.S. and its neighbors. The President asked the audience to think realistically when mentioning attacks, instructing us that when we speak of the word 'attack,' we must immediately think of the lightning speed of today's actions. Some people seem to think that the U.S. has not been attacked until bombs fall on New York and the streets are filled with bomb craters. They are simply closing their eyes and failing to see the fate of the countries conquered by Germany. The attack on Czechoslovakia began with the conquest of Austria. The attack on Norway and Greece began with the occupation of Albania and Bulgaria. The attack on the Suez Canal began with the occupation of Denmark and the invasion of the Balkans and North Africa. The attack on the U.S. in the future will begin with the domination of any base that threatens the security of North and South America. Anyone who knows anything about modern warfare knows that it is extremely dangerous to wait until the enemy has already seized a foothold before taking action. To prevent the enemy from seizing a foothold in the first place, the U.S. has expanded its patrols to the north and south of the Atlantic. We are now adding more warships and aircraft to strengthen the power of our Atlantic patrol fleet. It has greatly increased in the past year and is still constantly expanding. This is well known. The U.S. must be able to stop pirates on the sea, under the sea, and in the sky from approaching. The Americas must be willing to fight for the independence and integrity of the Americas as if protecting their own homes. The U.S. will provide all possible assistance to Britain and to all countries resisting the Axis powers. U.S. patrols are now helping to ensure the delivery of war materials to Britain. The safe delivery of war materials to Britain is extremely important. This can be done, must be done, and will definitely be done," (Reuters, 28th).

Washington – President Roosevelt will now speak for another fifteen minutes. When the President broadcasts his speech, diplomats from Latin American countries, U.S. government officials, and three hundred specially invited guests will be present to listen. This is a special feature of the President's broadcast. In addition to English, this speech will be broadcast to the world in fifteen languages: Arabic, German, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Czech, Greek, Slavic, Serbian, and Croatian (Reuters, 28th).

### Calling on American People to Cooperate to Protect Internal Security and Resist External Aggression

Washington – The United States was placed on a wartime footing yesterday as President Roosevelt formally declared the nation to be in a state of unlimited emergency. This historic announcement, in addition to being signed by Roosevelt himself, was also signed by Secretary of State Hull. The world, which had been waiting for President Roosevelt to announce his policy, has been notified that "the United States is in a state of unlimited national emergency, and all national sea, land, and air forces, as well as civil defense, must be placed on a ready basis to deter any direct or indirect acts of aggression against the Western Hemisphere." Roosevelt's announcement was made separately during a fireside chat. The announcement stated that a continuous stream of facts is sufficient to prove that the Axis powers' goals are not limited to the nations currently at war but "include overturning the current civilized order of the entire world and attempting to rule the human race's economy with the destructive force of sea, land, and air." The announcement stated that if the United States does not pay attention, it will be in great danger. Common sense tells us that "we should exceed the military procedures of peacetime to a foundation that enables us to immediately and decisively respond to any hostile acts surrounding the Western Hemisphere and to expel foreign saboteurs from our territory and society." The announcement called on all people participating in national defense production to exert their utmost efforts for the country so that a system of government in which private enterprise can exist can be maintained." President Roosevelt also called on loyal workers and employers to "abandon petty differences and take a broad view so that the survival of a government that recognizes the rights of labor and management can be guaranteed." The President also called on national and local leaders, officials, and people's defense groups to cooperate to ensure internal security and repel external forces. He also said that every group should produce as much as possible with as little waste as possible and strive to avoid unnecessary friction. The President said, "I call on all patriotic citizens to make the needs of the nation the first premise of their thoughts and actions so that we can ultimately mobilize all our material strength, all our moral strength, and all our material resources for emergency defense" (Associated Press, 28th).

### U.S. President Asks Congress to Approve Appropriations

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday asked Congress to approve an appropriation of $3,319,000,000 so that the Army and Navy could have more aircraft. The President's request was sent in the form of a letter to Texas Democratic Congressman and House Speaker Rayburn. The letter requested $2,790,000,000 to order Army aircraft and $529,000,000 to order Navy aircraft. Although the details are unknown, it is generally believed that the Army's request includes the purchase of thousands of heavy bombers (Taiwan Central News Agency, 28th).

New York - U.S. newspapers are reviewing the powers that President Roosevelt has after declaring an unlimited national emergency, believing that he can issue executive orders to take all necessary measures regarding national defense, but a declaration of war still requires the approval of Congress. His powers include: (1) Closing or confiscating radio stations; (2) Requiring priority for transporting troops and war materials; (3) Prohibiting securities transactions; (4) Instructing the Federal Reserve Banks to conduct business according to the Treasury Department's orders; (5) Prohibiting foreign exchange transactions; (6) Ordering the Coast Guard to be under the command of the fleet (already partially implemented); (7) Prohibiting ships of belligerent nations from leaving U.S. seaports; (8) Prohibiting the loading and unloading of all types of ships; (9) Confiscating goods; (10) Waiving tariffs on urgently needed goods; (11) Abolishing the eight-hour workday law; (12) Prohibiting the public from entering certain areas according to the Espionage Act; and (13) Requisitioning land necessary for military purposes. President Roosevelt has exercised his power to call up the National Guard. U.S. legal scholars do not have a clear distinction between a limited and an unlimited national emergency (Haitong News Agency, 28th).

Greatly Enhancing National Defense Strength

Washington – President Roosevelt declared last night that an unlimited national emergency exists. This state of emergency "requires the utmost authority and strength of our nation and our country." President Roosevelt greatly praised China's war against Japan and guaranteed additional aid to the Chongqing government. He said, "I believe that China's great defense will increase in strength." This defense simultaneously prevents Hitler's plan to dominate the world. The President declared, "The urgent problems we face are men and ships." "We have never concealed that aiding Britain is in our own interests. Britain and Germany both understand this deeply."

War Equipment for Democracies

Continuing to discuss the war situation, he declared, "Britain is still strengthening its national defense." The President declared that U.S. patrols "are currently helping to ensure the transportation of necessary supplies" to Britain and said that the U.S. will take the necessary steps to transport goods. He also said that our Army and Navy experts will begin to adopt any and all further measures or combined measures that can or should be adopted. The experts will implement the necessary additional new defenses with me. The President said that the United States faces a possibility that Hitler will realize his hope of dominating the world. This domination would have been completed if not for the heroic resistance of Britain and its colonies. He said that if the Axis powers lose control of the sea, they will definitely be defeated. President Roosevelt warned in his fireside chat to the nation that "any island in the Atlantic controlled or occupied by the Nazis will harm the immediate security of parts of North and South America and the U.S. island territories, as well as the ultimate security of the U.S. mainland. The first and fundamental fact is that what is happening in the European war will become a world war to dominate the world. This is what the Nazis have been planning all along. Hitler's conquest of Europe has never been considered a great achievement. The conquest of Europe is just a step toward achieving the final goal of conquering other continents. The fact is clear to us that unless the expansion of Hitlerism is now forcefully stopped, otherwise, the Western Hemisphere will be harmed by the Nazis' weapons of destruction." President Roosevelt pointed out that the extent to which the whole country "aids democratic countries is based on our own safety and the safe civilized world in which we want to live." He firmly declared that "every ounce of value in the goods we transport will help stop the dictators outside the Western Hemisphere. Every day the dictators are stopped will give us time to build more cannons, tanks, and airplanes. In heroic resistance, our country has doubled and redoubled production and manufacturing, increasing the material of war month by month for our country, for Britain, and for China, and finally for all democracies. The supply of this equipment will never stop and will increase day by day." He then criticized the closed-door faction's proposal that the government negotiate a peace plan, "Your government knows deeply what Hitler's victory is and what conditions he will impose. The so-called negotiated peace has no conditions to discuss other than Hitler's conditions. Germany's conditions are to divide the world, plant swastikas in all vast areas, dominate other nations, and establish puppet governments. When Hitler is victorious, his guarantees to the Americas will be the same as his guarantees to Austria and Czechoslovakia. I am not speculating, but only repeating the Nazis' list of conquests. The Nazis are preparing

Editorial

### Roosevelt Declares a State of Emergency Exists

Yesterday at noon, President Roosevelt, amidst the world's tense anticipation, delivered a historically significant fireside chat, pointing out the severity of the current international situation and the necessity of using patrols to ensure that necessary supplies reach Britain. He also reviewed the decisive role of sea power, declared the traditional demand for maritime freedom, and announced after the speech the existence of an unlimited national emergency, demanding that the United States' national defense, national power, and authority be strengthened to the extreme limit. Although this statement and measure are still one step away from actual participation in the war, President Roosevelt has already raised his sword at the most appropriate time.

This decision is the second fireside chat of Roosevelt's current term, only five months after the last one last winter, and there has been an accelerated leap in policy. In that decision, the United States only sought to assume the task of arming democracies fighting against aggression. Today, it not only takes the lead in ensuring the arrival of war materials but also clearly states that the United States will respond to the provocations of aggressors with resolute action. Compared to the fact that the United States only took military action almost two years after Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare, the factors of time and initiative are now playing a significant role. In his speech, Roosevelt asked the audience to have a realistic understanding of the meaning of "attack" and to think about the lightning-like actions of today. This is the best explanation for the rapid evolution of his own policy. Five months ago, the U.S. authorities still had to painstakingly appeal to the public that the reason for stepping up aid to democratic nations was to prevent the United States from being affected by the war. Today, the American people can accept the announcement of an unlimited emergency in a tense and solemn manner, indicating that the shift of Roosevelt's policy to a more active one is adapting to the rapidly changing international situation on the one hand, and reflecting the general psychology of the American people on the other hand. At a minimum, the opportunity to participate in the war has matured by more than 60%. The war threat of the aggressors can no longer scare the United States away.

The so-called issue of maritime freedom seems to involve abstraction and principles, but it is actually a traditional demand of the United States, which was listed as the second most important of Wilson's famous Fourteen Points. At the beginning of the current war, American public opinion was clearly chaotic, unlike the current one, which has shown a very clear anti-aggression stance from the beginning. Moreover, although the diplomatic activities of the German and Austrian sides in the United States at that time were far less sophisticated and transparent than those of the British and French, they were still significantly different from the fact that there was no room for activity this time. However, it eventually strengthened the American people's hatred of Germany, so that the main reason for standing absolutely on the side of the Allied countries to fight against Germany was the various maritime issues that contributed to it. Now, the maritime struggle between Britain and Germany, one side tightening the blockade and the other side attacking merchant ships, is very similar to the previous situation. The same problem is now pushing the United States to the brink of participation in the war. Of course, there is still a considerable distance between transporting war materials to Britain and actually participating in the war. However, Germany's desperate attempt to prevent the U.S. from transporting war materials will inevitably cause more serious consequences than the attacks on the Lusitania and Sussex in the previous war. At that time, the United States would have no other way to go except to participate in the war. The reason why President Roosevelt declared the existence of a national emergency at the same time as demanding maritime freedom is a necessary preparation to seize the initiative in order to cope with the occurrence of future emergencies. Unless Germany intends to avoid further stimulating the United States, or Britain has sufficient power to subdue Germany's piracy in the Atlantic, it may be possible to delay the United States' decisive action, but that is unlikely at present. Therefore, the United States' transition from the current existence of an emergency state to participation in the war will probably not go through a very long distance.

In the battle on Crete Island in recent days, the Nazi army paid a heavy price but did not achieve the desired results. Even if they try their best to reinforce and seize the island in a desperate posture, they will not be able to conceal the weaknesses that have already been exposed. In the Atlantic naval battle, the British side used the Hotspur to fight the German Bismarck. Although the losses of the two ships themselves are equal, the British side only lost one-fifteenth of its main battleships, while the German side even sacrificed one-third, so naturally the German side suffered a greater blow. However, we cannot underestimate the strength of German aggression too much because of this. Even in terms of piracy in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, the recent statistics of British ships sunk are still alarmingly high, which is undoubtedly a fatal blow to Britain that the U.S. cannot ignore. Moreover, although the Nazi attempt to control the world has little hope of success, its tentacles have been extended to the west of Asia and the Atlantic, centered on the Mediterranean. If Hitler could succeed in the Eastern Mediterranean and the northwest coast of Africa, then there would be no place in the vast universe that would not feel the threat of the aggressors. This further highlights the great contribution that Britain's bitter fighting has made to the entire world. In the Pacific, due to the containment of the Chinese war, those who are preparing to respond to the Nazi offensive in the future still have to continue to hesitate and watch. President Roosevelt's praise of the Chinese and British war efforts in his speech is by no means an overstatement. In terms of curbing aggression, China and Britain certainly deserve the expanded assistance of American military supplies.

The entire world has been greatly shocked by Roosevelt's magnificent call and decisive measures. This is the death knell for the sin of aggression and also the milestone of the victory of democracy and justice.

Chinese Army Adopts Mobile Warfare Tactics

Luoyang: According to a dispatch from Betty Graham, a special correspondent for the United Press, Wen Chaoqi (transliteration), Deputy Chief of Staff of the Luoyang Headquarters, told the United Press reporter today that the battle in the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi has entered a new stage. All Chinese troops, including the regular army, are employing mobile warfare tactics and guerrilla strategies in the north and west of the Zhongtiao Mountains. General Hu denied the Japanese claim that seven Chinese divisions had been annihilated and another ten divisions had been cut off. Wen explained that the difficulty of transportation in the past two years has prevented the majority of the effective troops in the Zhongtiao Mountains area from receiving complete supplies. As a result, when the Japanese attacked with a force exceeding the Chinese defenders by as many as seven Japanese divisions, the Chinese army adopted guerrilla tactics. Wen also stated that Wei Lihuang would order the Communist 18th Group Army to take up battle positions. Subsequently, troops from the former Eighth Route Army began attacking on May 10, resulting in the cutting off of several Japanese transportation lines. Wen also stated that the Japanese army in northwestern Hubei Province has withdrawn from its forward positions and that there would be no major battles in southern Henan until the Japanese army crossed the Yellow River to reach the south bank. It is reported that the Japanese army is busy training paratroopers in preparation for this attack. Elders in villages along the south bank of the Yellow River have been ordered to organize anti-paratrooper teams and will receive training in how to combat paratroopers. (28th United Press dispatch)

Communist Army Assists in Wiping Out the Japanese

Chongqing: A Central News Agency dispatch from Luoyang today declared that the Chinese army is currently conducting extensive guerrilla warfare against the Japanese transportation lines in North China to support the Chinese army's counteroffensive in Shanxi. The main Chinese forces are currently attacking the Pinghan, Pingsui, and Tongpu Railways and the highways of North China. The 18th Group Army (i.e., the Communist Army) is also assisting the Central Army in wiping out the Japanese. The Japanese army has urgently rushed reinforcements to Yuanqu, Jiyuan, Yangcheng, Jincheng, and other cities in southern Shanxi to prevent guerrilla attacks. The Communist New China Daily, to demonstrate the renewed unity of the people and the Communist army in North China, also vigorously publicized today that the Chinese army has cut off the railways controlled by the Japanese in North China. The newspaper stated that "Our troops in western Hebei and northern Shanxi have begun to move towards the Japanese garrison. The Japanese army is quite surprised by our effective cooperation. This can not only shatter the Japanese rumors of an offensive but also demonstrate the actual combat power of our Chinese army. Our Chinese army is resolutely fighting against Japan and is determined to unite as one." (28th United Press dispatch)

The method to swallow the Balkans is to swallow Central and South America, preparing to strangle the United States and Canada. At that time, people in the United States must compete with slave laborers elsewhere in the world for wages and the length of working hours must be designated by Hitler. The high standard of living, respect, and power of American farmers will be restored. Labor unions will become historical relics. American farmers will suffer an unprecedented calamity that cannot be protected by high tariff barriers. The Nazis will build a wall around the United States within its boundaries. The living institutions that we know now will be completely damaged, but even in this damaged state, we must pay the price of national militarization, labor, and permanent preparedness. The United States will be forced to permanently use all its resources for preparation, and the Nazi plan does not stop at occupying Europe, nor does it stop at occupying Libya, Tripoli, and coveting Egypt, the Suez, the Near East, and the Indian Ocean. Germany also has armed forces ready to occupy Spain, Portugal, take the ports of West Africa and new world outer islands such as the Azores and Green Islands. These islands are only seven hours flying distance from Brazil and control South Atlantic shipping routes. War is approaching our homes, and the ultimate goal of the Axis powers is to control the oceans, but to achieve this goal, Britain must be defeated first. The American people must not mistakenly believe that the Axis powers will not intensify their siege of the United States after defeating Britain, which is the first and most heinous villain.

Taking Full Risks to Control the Oceans

Knowing that failure to control the oceans will lead to disaster, it is necessary to take a gamble and risk everything to fight for control of the oceans. Therefore, if the war can be confined to the land, its entire organization will eventually collapse, the President continued to praise the silent people in the fallen countries who will not fail to be a powerful force in overthrowing the Nazis, and then declared that the entire history of the United States is connected to the freedom of the sea. In a brief review of past US actions to protect the freedom of the sea, he pointed out how efficient the navy was during the First World War, and in the Second World War, this issue is even more serious, because the ocean is attacked by four roads: first, new submarines, second, a large number of heavily armed raiding ships, third, bombers, and fourth, aircraft bombing merchant ships parked in ports. The President said that most of the merchant ship sinkings actually occurred within the territorial waters of the Western Hemisphere. The President continued, "The current extent to which the Nazis are sinking merchant ships is three times the rate at which Britain is replenishing them, and twice the current production of merchant ships by Britain and the United States. This is a frank fact. Our response to this disaster is to rapidly increase our shipbuilding program and secondly to help reduce losses at sea. He pointed out that the danger to the United States is increased by the presence of powerful Nazi warships in the territorial waters of the Western Hemisphere. The President stated the crisis resulting from Germany's occupation of Iceland, Greenland, the Azores and the Green Islands. He said, "These islands will become the actual springboard for attacking the security and independence of Brazil and its neighboring republics." President Roosevelt reaffirmed that "The United States is now gathering manpower and material resources only for defense and repelling attacks. I reaffirm this statement, but when we use the word "attack," it should be done practically. This is particularly relevant to the speed of modern warfare. Some people think that if New York, San Francisco, New Orleans or Chicago are not bombed by aircraft, we cannot say that we have actually been attacked. They are blind to the lessons of the fate of every country occupied by the Nazis."

Resisting German Attempts with Force

The President elaborated on national policy, including (1) resisting Hitler's attempts to extend his power to the Western Hemisphere, if necessary, and (2) providing any possible assistance to Britain and all countries resisting Hitler or his allies by force. The President declared, "The transportation of necessary supplies to Britain is imperative. This can be done, should be done, and will be done." He pointed out that other American countries, regardless of the opposition of a small number of people in the United States, such small numbers of people who believe that we cannot unite and take action, also. The President acknowledged that the country has a small group of honest and patriotic men and women who have a passion for peace that makes them blind to international acts of violence and the need to resist at any cost. The President said that these Americans should feel guilty about the insidious support given to them by the enemies of democracy. The President again assured that the United States would maintain the social progress gained under the "New Deal" and said, "Now is not the time for capitalists to gain and preserve profits." The President warned that the United States' institutions for mediating labor disputes must be implemented early so that industrial progress can be sustained. He said that the government has decided to prevent defense production from being disrupted. President Roosevelt declared at the end of his speech, "We will not accept a world ruled by Hitler. We will not accept the world of 1920, so that Hitlerism will not be able to sprout and grow.

The nation looks to every individual and every group to fully assume its responsibilities, without hesitation and without selfishness, so that

### Large Numbers of U.S. Aircraft En Route to China; Aviators Also Voluntarily Come to China; China and the U.S. Discuss Developing Cultural Relations

Washington: Washington officials have noted the exciting remarks made by U.S. Ambassador to China Gauss when presenting his credentials to Chairman Lin. According to non-official sources here, Gauss's remarks are not empty words, as aid to China is already on its way, and this aid does include a large number of aircraft. In addition, there is unconfirmed news that American aviators have set out for China, just as those who went to Britain to help in the war. At the same time, a method that has been effective in South America may soon be tried in the East. It is heard that Washington officials and non-official circles who are paying attention to the Far East and who wish to see closer relations between China and the United States are currently discussing in detail a plan to develop cultural relations between China and the United States in accordance with the Good Neighbor Policy between the United States and the Latin American countries.

From his reiteration of the U.S. policy of defending democracy and maintaining maritime freedom, the Chinese people are gratified that China's work of resisting aggression has been given considerable recognition by the United States. We deeply know that we should be grateful for the moral and material assistance provided by the American people. We believe that the U.S. President's announcement of unlimited national emergencies can not only strengthen the United States' national defense but also increase its assistance to countries fighting for self-preservation and independence. China and the United States have common goals, and the doctrines and ideals we defend are loved by every American. We can understand the importance of the U.S. President's statement that China's great defense forces are increasing. China must make a choice between freedom or slavery. We have been fighting for freedom for four years, and we will continue to fight to achieve final victory. The Chinese people and President Roosevelt share the belief that democracy and justice will ultimately prevail. "The Chinese Communist Party was also not surprised by the U.S. President's emphasis on the European war. (28th United Press dispatch)

Britain and Australia

London: This morning, thousands of people here jumped out of bed to listen to President Roosevelt's broadcast. The U.S. President's speech began at 4:30 a.m. (local summer time). Government officials will not comment until they have studied the full text of the speech. It is generally believed that the first official comment will be the British Prime Minister's own opinion or will be issued at the next parliamentary meeting. Non-official sources consider this speech to be, in principle, a speech to Americans. (28th United Press dispatch)

China

Chongqing: All sectors of the community here are eagerly awaiting President Roosevelt's broadcast speech. Although the reception was poor, the full text of the speech was immediately translated into Chinese and submitted to Chairman Chiang for study.

Chongqing: When President Roosevelt broadcast, he mentioned that China's fighting was increasing. Chinese non-officials welcomed and approved of this remark.

The Chinese side also believed that the United States' full awareness of the danger it faces would greatly excite the world democratic front. (28th United Press dispatch)

Germany and Japan

Berlin: President Roosevelt's speech arrived here very late this morning, so the newspapers did not have time to publish it and the authorities did not comment because they had not received the telegram.

Although the newspapers all published the President's speech in the most important position, they also paid close attention to the news that the German warship had been sunk. (28th Reuters dispatch)

### Matsuoka Delivers Speech Expressing Pessimism and Fear, Believing World Civilization Will Eventually Decline; Japanese Spokesperson Claims Preparation for War with the United States

Tokyo – Yesterday evening, Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka expressed pessimism and fear regarding the future of diplomacy, hoping that a "new order" might salvage it. Matsuoka made this statement at a conference of university presidents. He said, "In the current international crisis, I deeply fear that what I have long feared is about to come to pass." He also stated, "Since I was fifteen or sixteen years old, I have feared that modern civilization will sooner or later fall into decline, because the world places too much emphasis on material aspects. This unprecedented crisis will result in one of two outcomes: either the destruction of modern civilization, leading the world to lean towards material things, or the emergence of a new world order. The Tripartite Pact established last year aims at building a new order. My recent trip to Europe was intended to strengthen my belief in this matter." Matsuoka further stated that Japanese foreign policy aims to realize the spirit of "Hakko Ichiu," which, interpreted, means "to perpetually follow the path of justice." (United Press Dispatch, 28th)

Tokyo – Yesterday, Japanese Navy spokesperson Ide, in a nationwide radio address, stated that the American fleet, disregarding the possibility of war, is preparing to escort goods to England. He also said that they are currently preparing 200 warships and 4,000 aircraft to deal with the United States if necessary. (International News Service Urgent Dispatch, 28th)

Washington – This matter, already seen in the statement by the Japanese Navy Ministry spokesperson that America's preparation to send ships to escort convoys in the Atlantic clearly implies participation in the war, this matter or will cause Japan to exist in words of action, but officialdom did not criticize it. The public regards this statement as another act of Japanese psychological warfare. Aside from psychological warfare, it is still doubtful whether Japan truly desires to engage in war with the United States. Japan has made great efforts recently to create a victory similar to that of defeating the Chinese army, but it has not succeeded. In this situation, to have a chance of winning against a first-rate power is highly unlikely. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese Navy Ministry spokesperson's statement will not have any impact on American policy. Japan and Germany will soon clearly understand America's stance in the current world war. At that time, the process by which Japan intends to fulfill its alliance obligations will be seen by all. According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union originally hoped that after the ratification of the Soviet-Japanese agreement, Japan would immediately withdraw its troops from Manchuria and begin its southward advance. Now, seeing that this is not the case, they are disappointed. The situation in Henan remains unchanged. Japanese forces seized a large amount of American goods in Haiphong. The State Department is still awaiting more detailed reports to decide on action regarding this matter. Officialdom will not issue any criticism before receiving detailed reports.

### German Air Force Divisions Continuously Reinforce, Cretan Battle Situation Serious, Capital City of Canea Occupied by German Forces, Greek Navy Commander-in-Chief Captured

Berlin – The German High Command has just issued a statement saying that German forces have broken through the defending enemy forces in Canea and occupied the capital of Crete. (Haitong Dispatch, 28th)

Cairo – This afternoon, according to an official announcement here, although British forces fought with the utmost determination in the Cretan capital of Canea, they have been forced to retreat to more favorable positions further back. Fierce fighting is currently underway. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)

Berlin – This afternoon, sources in charge released news stating that German forces, after fierce battles in Crete, have greatly defeated the enemy forces. The Greek Navy Commander-in-Chief of Crete has been captured. German forces are in pursuit of British and Greek troops. (Haitong Dispatch, 28th)
London and Cairo military sources claim that fierce battles are raging around Maleme and Canea in Crete, and on the plains between the two cities. The Germans continue to send troops to land in Maleme, and the situation is serious. The Germans have suffered heavy losses, but they are only concerned with achieving their objectives, regardless of the losses. The question now is how long the Germans will continue to send troops and aircraft to Crete. The German troops arriving in Crete are not paratroopers, but troops transported by transport planes, landing at the Maleme airport, which is littered with wreckage. The news received here from Crete is only slightly more detailed than the official communiqués. The focus of the battle is east of Maleme. Elsewhere, German forces are still only resisting in the two ports, one of which is near Latimo, along the coast west of Canea. According to dispatches from Cairo, the number of rescued and landed crew members of the destroyers "Juno," "Greyhound," "Kelly," and "Kashmir" is now known. "Fiji": 34 officers, 500 sailors; "Kelly": 8 officers, 120 sailors; "Kashmir": 9 officers, 150 sailors; "Juno": 6 officers, 98 sailors; "Greyhound": 3 officers, 88 sailors. There is still no news about the survivors of the "Gloucester," but the ship sank not far from mainland Greece, and there were enough boats available, so many crew members are expected to be saved. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)

This afternoon, German reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the British fleet had already withdrawn. (Haitong Dispatch, 28th)

### British Home Fleet Fully Mobilized, Details of the Sinking of the Bismarck, German Naval Strength Nearly Halved, British Ship Prince of Wales Damaged in Battle

Berlin – After the sinking of the German Navy's mainstay battleship "Bismarck" yesterday, its strength has been reduced by half. German Fleet Commander Admiral Lütjens died on board. This is a major blow that will greatly affect the German public. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)

London – The Admiralty released a communiqué last night stating that aircraft of the Command had detected a German battleship and a cruiser, each sailing from Bergen. The British then made certain deployments, ordering the British ships "Norfolk" (Captain Phillips, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Wake-Walker) and "Suffolk" (Captain Ellis) to sail to the Denmark Strait to be on alert. On the evening of May 23rd, Wake-Walker suspected that the speed of the enemy ships had slowed slightly. Coastal reconnaissance aircraft also reported traces of oil on the water where the enemy ships had passed. On the evening of the 24th, the "Prince of Wales" again made contact with the enemy ships. After a brief engagement, the enemy ships immediately turned west and then south. The British ships continued to pursue. At this time, other British ships had also approached. That night, British ships and Canadian aircraft all mobilized, searching until 10:30 AM on the 26th, when the enemy ships were rediscovered. At that time, the "Bismarck" was seen by a Catalina aircraft of the Coastal Command at a location 550 miles west of Cape Finisterre. The aircraft was shot at, causing it to lose contact with the enemy ships. Half an hour later, at 11:15 AM, naval aircraft taking off from the "Ark Royal" (Captain Maund) spotted the "Bismarck" fleeing eastward alone. At this time, the "King George V" and "Rodney" had both approached the area, but had not yet sailed within engagement range of the enemy ships. Admiral Somerville then sent the destroyer "Sheffield" (Captain Larcom) to pursue the "Bismarck." In the afternoon, the "Ark Royal" dispatched a squadron of naval aircraft to attack with torpedoes, but they were unsuccessful. At about 5:30 PM, the "Sheffield" had made contact with the "Bismarck" and pursued it continuously. Within 20 minutes, the "Ark Royal" again dispatched a large squadron of naval aircraft to attack. One torpedo was seen to hit the "Bismarck" amidships, and another torpedo hit the starboard side. It was then heard that the "Bismarck" spun twice when hit by the torpedoes, and its speed decreased. At about 11:00 PM, several tribal-class destroyers led by the British ship "Cossack" (Captain Vian) also made contact with the enemy ships. Between 1:20 AM and 1:50 AM on the 27th, the "Bismarck" was again attacked with torpedoes by the British ships "Zulu" (Captain Graham), "Maori" (Captain Armstrong), and "Cossack." The "Cossack" and "Maori" each launched one torpedo. It was heard that its foretop had caught fire. An hour later, it was heard that the "Bismarck" had stopped. At that time, the ship was 400 miles west of Brest, and had been pursued by British ships for over 1,750 miles. It was then reported that the "Bismarck" moved forward again by eight miles, and could still fire accurate and fierce artillery fire. On the 27th, the "Ark Royal" again launched naval aircraft to attack, but because the visibility was poor, they were recalled. In the evening, the "Bismarck" engaged in artillery fire with the British destroyers. The "Norfolk" first engaged, and soon heavy British warships joined the battle. The details of the artillery battle at that time have not yet been received, but it is known that the "Dorsetshire" (Captain Martin) was ordered to sink the "Bismarck" with torpedoes. At 11:01 AM this morning, the "Bismarck" was finally sunk. As far as is currently known, apart from the "Hood," only the British ship "Prince of Wales" suffered minor damage, as previously mentioned.

Berlin Mourns in Unison

Berlin – The news that the German battleship "Bismarck," a mainstay of the German navy, was sunk by a superior British fleet, has greatly shaken the people of Berlin. Although they are mourning, they take pride in the bravery of the German naval officers and men in sinking the enemy ship "Hood." The "German General Review" wrote an article commenting that the German ship "Bismarck" traveled far across the ocean, sinking the world-renowned battleship "Hood," establishing great meritorious service. This has shocked the world. Now, the "Bismarck" was harmed by a superior British fleet. Before the ship sank, German Fleet Commander Admiral Lütjens reported the location of the sinking to the German High Command in concise and proud words. At that time, although the ship's hull could no longer move, it still fired its guns until the last shell, fiercely attacking the enemy. The ship's achievements will be immortal and unforgettable to the German people. (Haitong Dispatch, 28th)

Berlin – The German battleship "Bismarck" had a displacement of 35,000 tons. Its armament, in addition to anti-aircraft guns and torpedo tubes, included eight 38-centimeter guns and twelve 15-centimeter guns. It was launched on February 14, 1939. (Haitong Dispatch, 28th)

### The French Fleet and Colonies Will Never Be Transferred to Germany, Vichy Submits Written Guarantee to the United States, and Inquires About the Intentions of the British in Detaining French Ships

Washington – The Vichy ambassador to the United States, Henri-Haye, submitted a note containing a firm guarantee to Under Secretary of State Welles. In this note, the French government repeatedly assured the U.S. government that it would never hand over the French navy and colonies to Germany or any other country. Henri-Haye told reporters that he had been instructed by Vichy to draft a note aimed at dispelling American misunderstandings about the scope of Franco-German cooperation. This action by the Vichy government was because Secretary of State Hull had stated last week that if Vichy wanted to prove that its regime was not controlled by pro-German elements, it should provide a written statement of the government's position. Although Henri-Haye was unwilling to disclose the full content of the note, he said that those who wanted to disrupt Franco-American relations would be disappointed to see it. Henri-Haye has inquired with the State Department about the British Navy's interception of the French ship "Winnipeg" in the Caribbean Sea within the neutral zone, saying that he wanted to know whether the British intercepted this ship to check for contraband, or whether they wanted to confiscate it.

### Hong Kong Dollar Turns Firm Yesterday's Foreign Exchange Market Conditions: The dull market slightly declined and then rose, with the British and American gold pounds ultimately rising by one yuan. British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market barely held steady. American gold notes fell and then recovered to the original level, with a closing price of eighteen yuan and six fen. Compared to the previous day, the Hong Kong dollar has turned firmer. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes are still abundantly supplied, and the market continues to decline. The former retreated to one yuan and nine jiao seven fen, and the latter dropped to one yuan and six jiao five fen. Economic Notes Feng Jian Bank (5) Shi Hua's Manager is Zhu Zhi, who founded the Qiu Xin Machinery Factory more than thirty years ago. Once, someone from the furnace room came to ask if a large batch of Annam silver bars was arriving, willing to purchase them if so, explaining that they contained gold. People in the bank had not heard of this, but later, silver bars did arrive. They were surprised by the source of the information. The furnace room person said that it was notified by someone "sitting as the dealer" in Annam. Each silver bar weighed ten taels and was dark in color. One bar was taken, its corner slightly filed, and nitric acid was poured on it. Where there was gold, the color was clearly different. Zhu was fond of research and also used a crucible, placing the silver bar inside and pouring nitric acid on it, but it did not melt completely after a long time. Someone told him to put it on the stove and cook it, which made it easier for the silver to combine with the acid. He tried it, and indeed it worked. However, the heat was too strong, and suddenly a vapor as beautiful as peach blossoms rose straight up. Zhu was startled and quickly removed the fire, pouring it into a glass bottle. After a long time, there was sediment at the bottom. Some said this was gold, which could be gathered on an iron sheet and forged into gold. He tried it, and although it showed a slightly reddish-purple color, it did not look like gold. However, when viewed under a microscope, it shone with golden light, which was indeed hidden within. Perhaps it was because the heat was not sufficient. He took it to the furnace room and analyzed it with a blowpipe flame, melting it into a gold pellet the size of half a soybean, which was why the furnace room competed to buy it, and he sold each bar for one tael and five qian of profit. Afterwards, a Westerner told someone that Chinese merchants were truly clever: foreigners invented nitric acid, but Chinese people use it as a gold assaying technique, which Westerners did not yet know. This is because nitric acid undergoes a chemical reaction with silver to form silver nitrate; the parts containing gold are not corroded. People in the furnace room use this point to identify whether there is gold in the silver. I have also heard that the furnace room's technology for distinguishing the quality of silver is even more ingenious than this. Even if Westerners use chemical tests, it is not better. In reality, they only rely on experience. Chinese people have scientific ideas and techniques but cannot use them, and they are unwilling to research and delve deeper. Otherwise, with the Chinese mind, combined with knowledge, the future would have unlimited potential. Later, the Ministry of Revenue opened the Ministry of Revenue Bank (the Ministry of Revenue was established and renamed the Daqing Bank). The Ministry of Commerce wanted to open a Commercial Savings Bank, and the Ministry of Posts and Communications wanted to open the Bank of Communications, as well as the establishment of local commercial banks. Originally, I wanted to talk about these. However, this article already feels lengthy, and I am afraid it cannot be fully published in a few days, which would bore readers. It is also not allowed by the newspaper's space. I will leave it for a revised edition to make a statement. This is just a brief writing about the origin of the Chinese banking industry! (End) Answering Reader Questions Since the publication of Economic Notes, it has unexpectedly gained the sympathy of readers. Many people in the writing world have reprinted it, and I have received numerous letters from readers. Because the publication is intermittent, reading it is very inconvenient. Why not publish it daily or in installments? It is also difficult to clip and save it. Both suggestions of printing it into a special book as soon as possible to encourage each other are deeply appreciated. It should be known that the creation of the notes is nothing more than using spare time to occasionally jot down what I have heard and seen in daily life for entertainment, not for publication. Its publication in this newspaper is because commercial news is too rigid. I thought of ways to adjust readers' eyesight, so I sometimes adopt various submissions, select those with similar nature and taste, and insert one or two to decorate things. The notes are just to fill the gaps. This has already been stated before. Now that I have received readers' enthusiastic hope, I will wait for the facts to allow, sort out the entire manuscript, revise it, and publish it in print to seek correction from the world and provide conversation aids. I hereby express my thoughts and apologize for not being able to reply to everyone. Securities Public Bonds Must Wait Until After the Holiday The market seems to have entered a standstill. The black market for public bonds: yesterday's market conditions turned into a standstill again. The interest of dealers has decreased. Most of them are not acting rashly due to the upcoming holiday. However, trading in the morning was still lively, while the afternoon was very quiet. The market slightly weakened, but when there was demand, it was immediately raised. Currently, only 50,000 of the Ding Zhong Lianyi were bought, which was raised from one jiao to seven jiao, indicating that the number of suppliers is gradually decreasing. Today, only half a day of trading is done, and settlements are made in the afternoon. Tomorrow is the Summer Solstice holiday. Yesterday morning, Tiansheng continued to buy Bing Zhong, Lianyi bought Ding Zhong, Hongda continued to proceed very enthusiastically, and Xiexingyuan also entered Bing Zhong. However, Shengda, Yitai, Defu, Runli, and Lianhe sold one after another. Except for Ding Zhong continuing to rise, the rest were slightly weak. Trading was sparse in the afternoon, and major players did not enter the market. Changkang Xinhua slightly bought, while Shengchang, Xinfeng, and Jiufeng slightly sold. The meeting ended in less than half an hour. As a result, except for Ding Zhong being slightly better by two jiao, the rest were slightly lower by five jiao to one to two jiao. The total transaction volume was about 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan. The following is a brief table: Stock trading: 100 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded at a price of 23 yuan. Also, the stock market outside the Zhongye Public Firm: first fell and then rose, due to the US President's Fireside Chat not being as drastic as predicted. Steel stocks rose by five jiao to 28 yuan, 7 jiao and a half. There were few changes in the rest, and trading was normal. Yarn and Cotton There is Hope for a Turnaround in the Cotton Market The current cotton situation is firm and rising along with the yarn market. The hearts of people dealing in 42-count raw materials are very strong. It is said that the factories have not been operating for a long time. If the yarn market stabilizes, there is hope for prosperity in the cotton market. Another message: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai foreign firms: Although the yarn market has improved, the factories still have no intention to purchase. Only 200 bales of Brazilian cotton have been resold among peers in small amounts for days. However, overseas cotton markets are still strong, and current transportation is quite difficult. Therefore, everyone is bullish, and the market does not weaken due to thin trading. New York Cotton Market: Initially fell due to speculators selling, then slightly rebounded due to peers buying and short covering. As a result, the closing price was slightly down by four to five points compared to the previous day. Indian Cotton Market: Continues to stagnate. As for the prediction of today's opening market, it is expected to be slightly lower by one rupee. Limited Chips Shuang Ma Rises Straight Up The short side has to pay a premium of about three yuan per bale. The rumor of the bulls taking delivery and squeezing the shorts is confirmed. The recent yarn market has been extremely volatile, making it difficult to grasp. According to the market, a large amount of goods have been bought and taken delivery by Western merchants in Shanghai West, who are holding on to them without releasing them. Therefore, Shuang Ma factory orders are extremely scarce in the market. It is very difficult for the shorts who have sold to deliver the chips. Therefore, the factory orders that the shorts have dropped in have to pay a premium of two to three yuan per piece. One can imagine the tightness of the warehouse receipts. As a result, general floating shorts, seeing the unfavorable environment, are scrambling to cover, and the market has changed and risen in a straight line. At the same time, sales in Hong Kong have improved, and morale has been boosted. Market rumors were that everyone was shorting the previous day, but yesterday it was very different. Everyone wanted to buy. In this case, the market price will of course advance. The high price for 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,440 yuan, and the low price was 1,409 yuan. Initial trading in the afternoon was at 1,442 yuan, rising to 1,445 yuan. Those who profited slightly sold, falling back to 1,436 yuan. However, new buyers were active, and covering and new buying came together, gradually rising to 1,455 yuan. The closing price fell slightly back to 1,447 yuan. The final price was 1,451 to 1,452 yuan. Shuang Ma opened in the morning, continuing the firm upward momentum of the previous day. The opening price was 1,425 yuan, rising to 1,433 yuan shortly after. However, profits were taken, and it loosened to 1,409 yuan. Subsequently, margin prices rose, and rumors that a certain party was not only not selling but also taking delivery and squeezing shorts were even more rampant. The market price rose step by step to 1,440 yuan. The closing price was flat, at 1,435 yuan. It was found that the turnover in half a day totaled 11,755 bales, of which Hong Kong dealers entered 755 bales, and peer-to-peer trading reached 11,000 bales. Piece Goods ◇ Factory Cloth: The market initially fell yesterday and then rose, and the trend has stabilized again. There are still scattered amounts of goods at the end of the month being resold. Wholesale dealers on this street are absorbing them at a low price, and transactions have slightly increased. Sales of fine cloth and twill have rebounded by five jiao per piece, coarse cloth has risen by two jiao and a half, and bleached and dyed cloth is flat. Actual sales to customers are still sluggish. Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers bought over 200 pieces of twill, coarse cloth, and bleached and dyed cloth, and Southeast Asian dealers also bought over 100 pieces. Dealers on this street entered over 300 pieces of coarse cloth, grey cloth, colored cloth, and poplin. Eastern Cloth: Initially weak and then firm. The market was initially pessimistic due to the lack of prospects for actual sales, and selling pressure remained strong. Unexpectedly, Shuang Ma yarn reported gains step by step due to short squeezes. Loose shorts in the later market covered their positions in panic, pulling up prices in each round. Fine cloth from the exchange's leading brands surged by one yuan per piece. Spot leading brands rose even faster, closing at 45 yuan, 0 jiao, 7 fen, and a half. Four Gentlemen serge was one yuan, four jiao, two fen, and two li and a half. Sugar Market Sugar Prices Plunge and Slightly Rebound Yesterday's sugar market saw a trend reversal to flat after several days of excessive declines. Public association quotations: the spot price for white sugar arriving in April in groups 24 was 99 yuan, 1 jiao to 3 jiao. The initial price for late May was 99 yuan, then rose to 99 yuan, 7 jiao, and then slightly loosened to 99 yuan, 2 jiao to 5 jiao, up one yuan. The initial price for June 10 was softer at 100 yuan, 0 jiao, 2 jiao, then rose to 101 yuan, 6 jiao, loosened slightly midway to 01 yuan to 007 jiao, and closed at 101 yuan, 1 jiao, up 7 jiao. Taikoo Granulated Sugar was flat, B-mark was 106 yuan, 7 jiao, up 1 jiao, H-mark X Dongzhan was 95 yuan and a half. North and South Goods Jin Cai Hao's Prices Firm and Rise Dried lily flowers have had no continuous supply recently, so although the off-season is not booming, market prices have risen instead. Only one batch of Nanzi village dried lily flowers remains, totaling fifteen packages. It was quoted yesterday, with prices far exceeding 180 yuan, more than ten yuan higher than the previous quotation. Market quotations have not been able to keep up, but there is a hint of tightness. Moreover, there is still a month before the new season, so there is a risk of shortages. Shima Longan Stable Shima Longan has had few recent arrivals. Therefore, most of the goods are small to medium-sized, and the stock in the market is suitable for the missing grade. Therefore, dealers are unwilling to loosen prices too much. Yesterday, it was heard that hundreds of boxes were quoted. Goods of pure quality were not much different from the previous quotations, while inferior goods were slightly lower. Coal Hongji Small Coal Slightly Loosens The price of Hongji No. 1 small coal was even higher than lump coal due to the lack of arrivals, and it was difficult to find. Recently, lump coal prices have loosened, and a certain foreign firm is opening up supply without restrictions, so prices have inevitably fallen slightly. Peers are discounting, at 415 yuan per ton, ex-warehouse, which is a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the peak price. Shops on this street deliver to customers at 448 yuan per ton. Metals American Tinplate is in Short Supply and Prices Rise Iron Nails Still Show No Improvement Transactions of 180-pound and 200-pound American tinplate have been driven by Tianjin dealers every day, and purchases have been huge. In addition, the circulating goods in the market are already scarce, and the search has made it even more depleted, especially 180-pound goods. It is found that the purpose of foreign dealers absorbing the goods is for use in other ports, while 200-pound goods only rely on the sales of egg factories in this street. Foreign dealers have no intention of purchasing the goods. The market price is gradually trending parallel to 280-pound goods. However, dealers are very firm because they see the shortage of spot goods in the market and the search trend is fierce. As a result, the market is unusually firm and prices are rising sharply. The current market price is 440 yuan per box for 180-pound goods and 460 yuan per box for 200-pound colored goods, a difference of only 20 yuan, which is due to the large number of people inquiring about 180-pound goods in the market. Because sales in the Nanyang Islands and other places are stagnant, local hoarders occasionally release iron nails, causing a temporary glut of circulating goods, while there are few buyers. Therefore, holders dare not raise their minds, and the market is still showing no signs of improvement. The standard base price is estimated at 160 yuan per barrel, which is not as prosperous as the previous market, but dealers' morale is weak, and the bottom line is loosening.

China as a Free Outpost Has Won Worldwide Sympathy Currently Fulfilling the Responsibilities of a Free Outpost The United States Will Surely Provide Full Assistance The Mainland Press's Comments on America's Aid China Week The Mainland Press yesterday commented on the Aid China Week held in the United States, titling it, "China as a Free Outpost." The article stated: The Aid China Week held in the United States has concluded very successfully. During this period, parades, speeches, and other public performances were held in various places. In Washington, there were 7,000 overseas Chinese and 2,500 Americans participating in the parade. In New York City, a total of over 10,000 Chinese and American people participated. After the parade, Republican leader Wilkie and New York Governor Lehman delivered speeches. Both Men's Great Statements Advocate for Aiding China Mr. Wilkie mentioned the crisis currently facing the United States, stating, "Aggressive totalitarian countries are thinking of conquering the free nations of the world. Therefore, we should provide as much assistance as possible to China during this time of hardship. The reason is very obvious: China is our outpost." Mr. Wilkie solemnly explained the necessity of aiding China, equating the situation in the Far East with that in Europe, and stated, "Americans are determined to maintain these free outposts." Governor Lehman's speech also stated, "When freedom is threatened, the United States must prepare to defend it just as China does. China urgently needs our assistance. If we can provide as much assistance as possible, then China will surely continue to fight until the final victory." Lehman continued, "We should never forget all that the Chinese people have done for democratic freedom and other nations of the world. The Chinese people are a resolute and unyielding nation." Strengthening China's Confidence in Victory The significance and nature of the Aid China Week held in the United States is indeed a grand event. This move will not only encourage the patriotic spirit of the Chinese people but will also strengthen their belief in ultimate victory. During China's arduous struggle, only the United States can provide full assistance. The American people's support for China's cause is no less than their support for the United States. Mr. Wilkie's statement that China is a free outpost is indeed the highest compliment that a great statesman like Mr. Wilkie could give to any country. Mr. Wilkie not only made this statement to thousands of listeners but also broadcast it on the radio and in newspapers. When he made this statement to the Chinese people, it reminded the struggling Chinese people that they were serving democratic freedom with their labor and sweat, and were indeed fulfilling their outpost responsibilities. Senior Police Officer Meets with Howard to Discuss Defense After assuming office, Colonel Howard, commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, visited military authorities of various countries in this city to discuss defense matters. Yesterday, Public Works Bureau General Inspector Bowen, Deputy General Inspector Smith, and Assistant Inspector-General of District B Ge Laibo visited Colonel Howard at the US Marine Corps headquarters and discussed defense arrangements, which was quite confidential. Narutoman Maru Returns to Shanghai from Yong After Quarantine, it Can Enter the Port The Narutoman Maru, newly dispatched by the Japanese merchant shipping company Dongya Shipping to run the Shanghai-Yongbo line, sailed for Yongbo on a trial run at about 9 pm on Monday evening and returned to Shanghai at dawn yesterday morning. Due to the nature of the trial voyage, there were no passengers or cargo on the round trip. After the ship arrived at the Wusongkou, the Navy Quarantine Office required the ship's crew, who came to Shanghai from the epidemic port of Ningbo, to be vaccinated against epidemics, so it was not allowed to enter the port. It is still anchored outside the port, waiting for the completion of the anti-epidemic procedures before entering the port. The official voyage is still pending the issuance of a navigation permit by the Japanese Navy authorities before it is officially implemented. American President Roosevelt's Speech American Overseas Chinese Enthusatically Support Believe this Decision Will Have Broad Impact But American Business Interests Will Not Change The English-language Greater America Evening Post stated that important American merchants in Shanghai recently met with reporters and unanimously praised President Roosevelt's decision this morning (28th) to declare the existence of an unrestricted national emergency in the United States. According to Hawkins, general manager of the Shanghai Power Company, President Roosevelt's declaration was "the right thing to do." It is still too early, and the impact has not yet been realized in the Far East, but this decision will surely have a broad impact. It was only made after facing the facts. He believes that the defense measures that the United States has already taken will therefore be further improved. A major American merchant who recently returned from the United States said that he was not surprised by President Roosevelt's decision, but he believed that after President Roosevelt made this speech, American business interests would not change. Public Works Bureau American Director Aleman said, "President Roosevelt's steps are just what we expected. The President will do what he says. I believe that what the President said has indeed won the support of American merchants in the Far East." Other foreigners in Shanghai had mixed reactions to President Roosevelt's speech. Most British overseas Chinese expressed their relief, while overseas Chinese from Axis countries tended to underestimate the importance of this decision. A certain Japanese overseas Chinese thought that President Roosevelt's speech was not as severe as expected and admitted that Japanese overseas Chinese here had previously expected President Roosevelt to make a more serious announcement. The Grain Committee May Discuss Lowering the Price Limit for Hong Kong Rice to Match the Scheduled Selling Price of Tribute Rice Three Rice Shops Not Allowed to Sell Hong Kong Rice The French Concession authorities recently announced that the Tribute Rice purchased by the Public Works Bureau will be sold at a price of 87 yuan per stone in the near future. This is an important action to lower rice prices in Shanghai. It is found that the rice price of 87 yuan per stone is the lowest selling price in Shanghai in four months, less than half of the rice price less than a month ago. Currently, the French authorities have transported a large amount of Tribute Rice and will sell it at the new price limit. It is reported that another 42,000 bags of Tribute Rice are being carried by the French ship Bernadian de Saint Pierre and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (29th). It is generally believed that since the rice purchased by the French Public Works Bureau is extremely cheap, the Public and Concessions Public Works Bureau will continue to take steps to reduce the current maximum price limit of 110 yuan per stone. A spokesman for the Public Works Bureau recently stated that the Public Concession Rice and Grain Committee may convene a meeting soon to discuss this matter. Penalties for Over Thirty Rice Shops After the arrival of the low-priced rice managed by the Public Works Bureau in Shanghai, there is no need to worry about the future of the people's food in this city. However, unscrupulous people have used this low-priced Hong Kong rice to cheat and seek profits. There have been a total of four cases that have been discovered by detectives. Yongchang Rice Shop was found to be filling low-quality rice with low-priced Hong Kong rice and was eventually deprived of its right to sell Hong Kong rice. Yuanshengxiang Rice Shop is still under investigation for inconsistencies in quality. Xintai and Yucheng Public Rice Shops filed a lawsuit in court due to adulteration. All of these are enough to warn unscrupulous merchants. According to reports from reporter Ping Mingzuo, yesterday, Xiangmao Foreign Firm received instructions from the Public Works Bureau that more than 30 retail rice shops in the two concessions of this city have been deprived of their right to sell low-priced Hong Kong rice, and Xiangmao Foreign Firm was instructed to quickly notify Tailun and other 17 grain shops not to resell Hong Kong rice to these rice shops. As for the reason for being deprived of the right to sell Hong Kong rice, it is impossible to find out for a while. It is found that these more than 30 rice shops that have lost the right to sell Hong Kong rice include 12 in the French Concession: (1) Taishan, (2) Gongli, (3) Dadong, (4) Guanghua, (5) Dongsheng, (6) Tongshang, (7) Fuchang, (8) Dadong, (9) Yuanhe, (10) Xintai, (11) Futai Xin, (12) Xinkang. There are several in the central area of the Public Concession: (1) Yuchengtai, (2) Jinfeng, (3) Fukang, (4) Huolongxing, (5) Yudafeng, (6) Taikang. There are a total of eight in the Xinzha District and Jing'an Temple District: (1) Gongshangchang, (2) Guchangsheng, (3) Dachunghua, (4) Hegongshungong, (5) Guchangsheng, (6) Jinshengchang, (7) Wanxindong, (8) Zhaoyuanda. There is one in the Putuo District: (1) Jinyulong. There is one in the Hongkou District: (1) Tongsheng. There are several in the Huishan District: (1) Tongkang, (2) Baotai, (3) Tianfeng, (4) Daihengchang, and there is one in the Yangshupu District: (1) Dongxing. The above totals 33 rice shops. French Public Works Bureau's Low-Price Sales Policy In order to thoroughly stabilize the rice market, the French Public Works Bureau adopted the following control force methods for rice purchase and sales: (1) Anyone who purchases foreign rice from the production area of Vietnam must join the Rice Import Committee. (2) The quality and quantity of the rice purchased must be reviewed and approved by the French Concession authorities. (3) This rice must be sold to rice shops in this city for citizens to purchase. (4) Those who operate the rice of the French Public Works Bureau can obtain the following profit margins: (A) 2.5% for import shops, (B) 8% for wholesale rice shops (of which an average of 4% must be removed for losses), (C) 4% for rice shops. Therefore, although the purpose of the French Concession authorities' purchase and sale of tribute rice is also to prevent hoarding and speculation, the methods are quite different from those of the Public Concession. (1) The Public Concession authorities first purchase Hong Kong rice and transport it to Shanghai, and then sell it to rice shops. The French Concession authorities control the tribute rice ordered by rice merchants. (2) The price at which the Public Concession Hong Kong rice is sold to grain shops and rice shops is regulated. The French Concession must settle prices according to foreign exchange, with slight fluctuations, but the retail prices of rice shops are pre-regulated. (3) The foreign rice sold by the Public Concession is all one color of 40-grain Xiaowen rice. Although the French Concession authorities' tribute rice is tribute rice, the quality is determined according to the needs of the rice shops. Saigon No. 1, No. 2, and mixed broken rice are all allowed to be purchased. Foreign Firms Participating in Assisting The French Public Works Bureau originally organized the import committee by Dahu, Fushin, and Fu Jia three foreign firms to handle Chongmi. However, due to the large number of affairs, the three foreign firms were afraid that they would not be able to cope with them. Yesterday, Fuyi, Dafeng, and Jinfu and other foreign firms participated in the cooperation to assist in handling the formalities for transporting Gongmi to Shanghai. If the grain shops want to order, please contact the above-mentioned foreign firms directly. According to the reliable information, this Gongmi has not yet been shipped to Shanghai. It is necessary to wait until the amount ordered in this city is determined before sending a telegram to Saigon to start shipping it to Shanghai. A Few Rice Shops Closed Yesterday All of the 3,000 rice shop employees in the city jointly submitted a request to the rice shop owners on the 24th of this month, requesting an increase in salaries, bonuses, and improved treatment, and limited a satisfactory response within three days. Because the owners did not accept it, it caused dissatisfaction among all employees. The employees of the rice shops announced a joint strike starting yesterday, so ten rice shops closed temporarily yesterday due to the employees' strike, and posted notices at the doors of each shop stating, "This shop is temporarily closed for business." However, most of the rice shops still operated as usual yesterday. The Rice Shop Industry Association held a temporary committee meeting at the Maoyi Lane meeting place on Shanhai Road yesterday afternoon to discuss and resolve the labor disputes between the various closed rice shop owners. As of the time the reporter went to press, there was no news of a good strategy. However, according to the labor side, the requests they made this time were out of necessity. Shanghai Press Thanks Guilin Cultural Circles Decided to Uphold the Original Intention and Strive to Struggle Adhere to the Post and Not Betray the Duty of a Journalist Redouble Efforts to Strive for National Survival Guilin cultural circles and various groups held a celebration on the evening of the 25th of this month to celebrate Dagongbao's acceptance of the honorary award from the University of Missouri School of Journalism. The Public Works Bureau Strictly Prohibits the Sale of Flat Flour Mixed with Low Quality and Found Inaccurate Weight from Users If there is such a Situation, you can Exchange the Full Amount Regarding the sale of low-priced flour, the Public Works Bureau contacted the Fuxin Flour Mill and the mill agreed to continue to supply 5,873 bags of low-priced flour daily from May 1st, excluding Sundays, until 300,000 bags (each bag weighing 49 pounds) were sold out, and stipulated that each user should receive flour from more than 20 flour shops on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday each week according to the amount they should receive (a total of 8,318 bags per day). On the one hand, it designated Ruiji, Yuanfeng, Tongshengchang, Dinghouji (namely Yuanfeng), and Wanfeng and Zhengfeng as six flour shops responsible for the distribution. After 35,238 bags of flour from the factory were distributed each week, the remaining 6,352 bags would be offset by one-tenth of the imported foreign flour. The situation has already been published by the Public Works Bureau. Now it is learned that users have found that the foreign flour they received is mixed with water-stained goods and has insufficient weight. They have reported this to the Public Works Bureau for review. After receiving the report, the Bureau believed that if the users' claims were true, it would be contrary to the original intention of the authorities to handle the low-priced sale of flour. In addition to ordering each flour shop to seriously sell the flour, if users find the above-mentioned situation in the future, they can refuse to accept it and exchange the full amount to avoid losses and prevent abuses. At the General Meeting of the Chapter, it was decided to send a telegram to Shanghai press colleagues to pay tribute and comfort the families of the dead colleagues. Shanghai press colleagues sent a reply telegram yesterday to express their gratitude and expressed that they would uphold their original intention and redouble their efforts, etc. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To the Guilin Cultural Circles Celebration of the Dagongbao's Acceptance of the Medal Convention, your telegram has been received with respect. Dagongbao's honor of being awarded the Medal from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in the United States not only increases the status of our press circles internationally, but also lays the foundation for close cooperation between the press circles of China and the United States. Dagongbao is even more modest, declaring that it is willing to attribute this honor to its colleagues in Shanghai, and we are even more grateful to your association for its special telegram of encouragement. Although colleagues here are in a difficult situation, they adhere to their posts and strive to struggle, only seeking not to betray the duty of a journalist. From now on, we will uphold our original intention and redouble our efforts to vow to strive for national survival and maintain justice for the world. We also ask the seniors to give guidance from time to time. We look forward to it very much. We respectfully offer our sincerity and remotely wish Dagongbao's special honor, and express our respect to the arduous struggle of the national cultural circles. At the same time, on behalf of the bereaved families of Zhu Xinggong, Zhang Sixu, Cheng Zhenzhang, Pu Xubai, and Jin Huating, we express our deep gratitude to your association for its condolences. Shanghai Press Colleagues respectfully bow, (28th)"

It is found that the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession this year on April 17 authorized the Public Works Bureau to issue 9 million yuan of public bonds, issued at 92.5% of the face value, with 2.5 million yuan retained to offset outstanding temporary loans and funds kept by the Bureau.

The Post Office is Recruiting Mail Carriers The Written Test Has Been Rescheduled After the physical examination of mail carriers recruited by the Postal Administration was completed on the 6th of this month, about 1,300 people passed. The Bureau originally scheduled to hold a written test in the Administration on the 25th of this month, but because of the large number of people, it was not enough to accommodate them, so it was decided to reschedule it to the 8th of next month and hold it in the auditorium of Aurora University on Lovan Road in the French Concession. The dates for the oral test and bicycle test were originally scheduled to be held at the end of next month, but it has now been decided to postpone them. Nearly Three Thousand Corpses Exposed in the Public Concession This Month According to the announcement of Pushan Villa, from the 1st to the 27th of this month, the Villa collected and buried a total of 2,842 corpses in the Public Concession, including 2,250 infant corpses and 596 adult corpses. In a prosperous city, there are so many exposed corpses that cannot be buried, which is really sighing. All Circles Move The Committee for Soliciting Donations from Citizens of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association appealed to all circles to save money on the Dragon Boat Festival to help refugees.

### Intense German Air Raids; Britain Admits to Losing Six Ships

London - The Admiralty announced that the British Navy's operations in the Eastern Mediterranean have prevented the enemy from landing troops by sea on Crete to date, and have heavily damaged enemy transport ships fully loaded with troops intending to reach the island. In addition to the two enemy troop transport fleets already announced as having been routed and suffering heavy losses by the British Navy, British submarines have also shelled and sunk two Greek fishing boats carrying enemy troops. Details are still awaited. Also, two enemy torpedo boats were sunk and two were damaged during combat, and some enemy aircraft were shot down by British ships. Detailed reports have not yet been received. The British Navy, operating in this limited sea area without fighter protection against attacks by large formations of enemy aircraft, has inevitably suffered losses. The Admiralty regrets to announce the loss of the following ships: the cruiser "Gloucester," the "Fiji."

Details of the pursuit of the German 30,000-ton battleship "Bismarck" and a German cruiser after they were reported by British reconnaissance aircraft to have departed Bergen, Norway, followed relentlessly for 1,750 miles until the British cruiser "Dorsetshire" torpedoed and dealt the final blow to the "Bismarck" 550 miles west of Cape Land's End, have been released. The entire British Home Fleet was deployed to ensure that Hitler's boasted "Bismarck" could not escape. The British battlecruisers "Hood" and "Repulse," several battleships (including two diverted from the North Atlantic convoy escort), several British ships diverted from Gibraltar and the northern seas, and cruisers, destroyers, the Naval Air Arm, and British coastal aircraft all participated in the pursuit, lasting four days from the fog-shrouded Denmark Strait to the North Atlantic, ultimately sinking the "Bismarck." According to the communiqué, the British coast reported sighting an enemy battleship and a cruiser, each travelling south at high speed, at a time when visibility in the Denmark Strait was poor and fluctuating. Initially, the British and enemy ships were only six miles apart, but then rain and snow fell intermittently, and thick fog reduced visibility to one mile. However, the "Norfolk" and "Suffolk" continued to pursue the enemy ships relentlessly throughout the night. At the same time, other British naval vessels were ordered to proceed swiftly to intercept the enemy ships for battle.

On the morning of the 24th, the British ships "Rodney" (Captain Kerr, Rear Admiral Holland's flagship) and "Prince of Wales" (Captain Leach) made contact with the enemy ships and began to engage. The "Bismarck" was damaged and was seen to be on fire at one point. One shell exploded in the magazine of the "Hood" (42,100 tons), and the "Prince of Wales" was also slightly damaged. The British ships continued to pursue southwest. The enemy ships tried to escape but failed, and were persistently followed by the "Norfolk" and "Suffolk," maintaining contact. Naval torpedo and bomber aircraft (Captain Vian) launched torpedoes from a distance and were seen to hit the "Bismarck." The "Norfolk," "Suffolk," and "Prince of Wales" continued the pursuit until approximately 3 p.m. on the 25th, when they lost contact with the enemy ships due to deteriorating visibility. At that time, the enemy ships were approximately 35 nautical miles southeast of the southern tip of Greenland. Other British naval vessels immediately deployed to search, with the main force of the Home Fleet, commanded by Admiral Tovey aboard the "King George V" (Captain Patterson), speeding southwest from the northern seas. Other British ships, led by Rear Admiral Somerville aboard the "Repulse," departed from Gibraltar and sped northwest. The British ships "Rodney" (Captain Hamilton) and "Ramillies" (Captain Read), escorting a convoy in the North Atlantic, also turned back towards the enemy ships, in addition to British coastal aircraft and those stationed in Newfoundland.

### Culture in Bombarded London

During the large-scale German air raids on London on the night of December 29th last year, unprecedented fires broke out, and the cultural sector suffered no less devastation than other industries. Famous publishing houses such as Nelson, Longmans, Blackwood, Collins, Walter Lock, Sampson Low, Hutchison, Spottiswoode, Heit Whitt, Simpkin Marshall, and other smaller bookstores were mostly completely or partially destroyed, with losses of no less than six million books.

However, British publishers and booksellers were not discouraged. They quickly sought new addresses, and within a few days, locations were secured, and staff returned to work as usual in the new environment. Simpkin Marshall, known as the largest distributor in the English-speaking world, suffered particularly heavy losses, with three million books destroyed, almost collapsing. Subsequently, the Publishers Association bought the entire business, thus preventing the interruption of operations.

The new company adopted a cooperative model, not focused on profit, and operations are managed by the Publishers Association. Four central distribution centers were established in London to distribute various books to bookstores for retail, so British publishing companies will focus on wholesale. Smith & Son, which originally considered Simpkin Marshall its only major competitor in wholesale, also offered assistance in this difficult time, which is truly commendable.

German air raids on London also affected libraries. The University College Library had a collection of 400,000 volumes, of which 100,000 were destroyed, many of which were rare German history and literature books. Later, when searching for remnants in the rubble, the first book found was "A Cultural History of Germany," which was quite intriguing.

In addition to finding ways to relax during air raids, reading became a form of solace in England. The library business has therefore taken on a new look.

For example, St. Pancras has now created a mobile library, installed in a truck carrying 2,000 books, traveling to various locations every week to allow readers to exchange books. As a result, members of the Home Guard, anti-aircraft balloon squadrons, anti-aircraft artillery units, and other units who cannot leave their posts can enjoy the convenience of reading on-site. Relief organizations such as the Red Cross have also organized book service teams, and Prime Minister Churchill's youngest daughter also participates in the service.

Since the outbreak of the war, major London newspapers have reduced their size by two-thirds. Newspapers now selling for one penny have been reduced from nineteen pages to four pages four days a week and six pages for the remaining three days. Newspapers costing two pennies have been reduced from twenty-two pages to ten pages.

Most newspapers (except for the Daily Worker and the News Chronicle) are still making money, despite the limitations on paper and circulation and the impact of expensive pulp (pulp has risen from £11/5/- per ton to £26/10/25). This is due to several factors: First, the number of readers has not decreased. The Times and the Daily Telegraph have even requested readers to register in advance with nearby newsstands, thus eliminating the problem of returned newspapers. Second, the number of internal staff has been reduced. Apart from senior staff, those over a certain age are given severance pay, thus saving expenses. Third, after the reduction in newspaper size, advertising rates have been greatly increased. Ordinary advertising space, which cost £5 per inch before the war, has now risen to between £8 and £9. Prime advertising space on the cover corners and near the reviews has also risen to between £10 and £15. The maximum size of advertising space is two columns and eleven inches, and its price is equivalent to that of a half-page advertisement before the war. One-penny newspapers have recently changed each page from seven columns to eight columns, reducing the size of each column, but the advertising fees remain the same, thus invisibly increasing advertising revenue. Fortunately, the demand for advertising space exceeds supply, allowing newspapers to profit.

With the reduction in staff, editors are extremely busy, sometimes even acting as tea servers. Chris Ewart of the Daily Express said it well, "I myself am a wastepaper basket. People of our generation do everything ourselves, like a pack of watchdogs."

Although the size of major newspapers has been reduced, the content has not diminished. All news, limited by space, is carefully edited, and editorials focus on key points, avoiding unnecessary words. After this strict control, British newspapers have become even more suitable for readers' tastes.

### Grain Market: Morning Drop, Afternoon Rise in Rice Prices due to Conservation Efforts

The rice market yesterday saw prices initially fall and then rise, presenting a fluctuating situation. In the morning, rice shops went on strike, disrupting sales. In the International Settlement, Hong rice continued to be sold publicly. The French Municipal Council officially announced an order for 100,000 bags of mixed grade 1 and 2 broken rice, with merchants having already ordered 10,000 bags at a price of 98 yuan per 220-pound bag, with restrictions on profit margins and retail prices. This adds another layer of obstruction to market manipulation by merchants and another layer of protection for the food supply. As a result, selling pressure increased, and both spot and futures rice prices fell. Grade 1 Saigon rice fell from 122 yuan to 118 yuan, grade 2 white rice from 117 yuan to 115 yuan, small-grain rice from 117 yuan to 114 yuan, Yinghua Sze broken rice from an initial price of 111 yuan to 105-6 yuan and then to 103 yuan, small-grain rice from 140 yuan to 137.5 yuan, and grade 1 Saigon rice from 143 yuan to 141 yuan, a decrease of 4-6 yuan compared to the previous market. However, customers in rural villages believed that prices had already bottomed out, and the market announced a one-day closure for the Dragon Boat Festival, suddenly prompting widespread buying, which reversed the decline. Under the repeated manipulation of large players, prices rose steadily. By the close of the market, although prices had not yet recovered to their original levels, all rice prices, except for Min Dang rice, which had previously been popular in rural areas and maintained its leading position, had risen. Due to a lack of goods in Pudong warehouses and difficulty in transporting them, and weak sales within the Settlement, it consistently underperformed, lacking any change. As a result, high-grade rice remained at 116-17 yuan, and lower grades at 114 yuan. Other rice prices only fell by 1-2 yuan, except for small-grain rice, which was even lower than Grade 1 Saigon rice.

Thick and thin粳 rice varieties saw weak sales due to merchants expecting continued weakness in foreign rice prices, leading to hesitant buying in anticipation of the festival. Trading was scarce, making it difficult for the market to stabilize, and prices fell by 2-3 yuan. Thick粳 rice, such as Kunshan special fresh粳 rice, was offered at 132-3 yuan, ordinary fresh粳 rice at 130 yuan. Goods from shops: Nanhang early and late rice were offered at 134.5 yuan for fresh goods, ordinary goods at 132-3 yuan, and lower grades at 130 yuan. Original packages were not offered.

With the Dragon Boat Festival approaching, and other goods trending upwards, the glutinous rice market became oversupplied, leading to a price drop of 2-3 yuan. Hong Kong white glutinous rice was offered at 112 yuan and 110 yuan, and domestic glutinous rice at 122 yuan.

### Flour Market: Sudden Rise, Sudden Fall

The foreign flour market has returned to a volatile state. Prices of various goods have risen and fallen suddenly, fluctuating unpredictably. This is due to sluggish actual sales and abundant inventory. Holders, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately sold off. The price of Fort Brand American flour opened at 30.05 yuan and immediately fell to 29.70 yuan, a decrease of 0.80 yuan. The decline in Golden Dragon flour was lighter, initially opening at 29.20 yuan, rising briefly to 29.30 yuan, and then seeing no buyers. Therefore, subsequent trading saw mutual rejection, and both buyers and sellers became cautious. Market expansion must wait until after the Dragon Boat Festival.

Wheat trading has been quiet for a long time. Early stocks of old wheat have already been sold off, and there is no supply. Factories are waiting for the new wheat to be launched before resuming business, so the market remains stagnant.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Weakens, then Sees Replenishment

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's posted rates. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates initially weakened but then rebounded. This was initially due to Chinese speculators dumping their holdings, followed by competition for Hong Kong telegraphic transfers, causing the futures rate for US dollars to rise to a point where settlement was possible at 5.46875 yuan before returning to 5.4375 yuan at noon. New trading in July futures saw Chinese merchants offering at 5.50 yuan, causing the British exchange rate to also harden to 3 pence 359375 before returning to 3 pence 34315, both the same as the previous day's closing price. There was no market in the afternoon due to it being Wednesday.

Hong Kong Also Buys

Since this morning, foreign telegrams showed British, American, and Indian silver prices unchanged. International exchange rates saw an increase of 0.25 in the US to British rate, with the rest unchanged. The Central Bank's posted rates remained unchanged. The domestic market opened with banks selling spot British exchange at 3 pence 34375 and US dollars at 5.4375. Foreign banks were eager to supply. Chinese banks and speculators successively purchased May and June US dollars at 5.46875, indicating a weakening trend. HSBC's posted rates remained unchanged. After the balanced silver tax of 23.75% was levied, speculators dumped July US dollars at 5 yuan even, and the June rate also dropped, hardening to a point where it was difficult to sell. British dollars also weakened to 3 pence 359375. After 11:15, there was a rush to buy, and at the same time, Hong Kong telegraphic transfers also came to buy June US dollars at 5.46875 and 5.4375. The market gradually rebounded. The market closed at noon with spot and June British exchange at 3 pence 3475 and US dollars at 5.4375, both the same as the previous day's closing price. Trading was quite active.

### The Gold Market Turns Rapidly Upward After "Fireside Chat," Returns Near 400 Yuan Threshold

The gold market yesterday saw the unofficial market turn from decline to rise, reaching near the 6,400 yuan threshold. Sentiment has turned from weakness to strength, due to the US President's "fireside chat" focusing on maintaining freedom of the seas and non-aggression, and the foreign exchange market turned from weakness to even. As a result, short sellers, in disappointment, tended to cover their positions. Since the market opened this morning, under selling pressure from securities firms such as Kangyong, Defu, and gold shops such as Chengji, and the US dollar hardened to a point where it was difficult to sell at 5.5 yuan, retail shorts aggressively pushed down. Although buyers tried their best to support, it was not enough, and the price retreated from 6,365 yuan to 6,320 yuan. It was not until after 11:15 that disappointing news arrived. Securities firms suddenly came back to buy, and Yiyuan competed to purchase, leading to rumors of short covering by Shanghai West firms. Retail shorts competed to cover, and the price rose sharply to 6,383 yuan, ultimately reversing the decline and rising 14 yuan. Total trading for the half-day was approximately 40,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon due to it being Wednesday. The off-market price was around 6,385 yuan. The rollover from May to June saw sellers offering a premium to buyers, initially at 73 yuan and then at 70 yuan, slightly lower by 5 yuan. Cash trading was scarce, and prices also rose by more than a dozen yuan. Tianyuan offered public and thirty taels, with prices 360 yuan higher than futures prices. Jewelry gold initially fell by 5 yuan and then returned to even, while customs gold and other rates remained unchanged.

Futures Rise by 14 Yuan

Since the opening of the June futures contract this morning at 9:15, the price was 6,360 yuan per bar (10 taels), 2 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The opening saw active fluctuations. Yida sold heavily to 6,350 yuan. Tianyuan and Xinyuan strongly bought, pushing the price up to 6,365 yuan, and customs futures for June and May US dollars were also able to settle at 5.46875. As the market trend declined, securities firms such as Kangyong, Defu, Decheng, Chengji, and Yili successively sold heavily, with prices around 6,335 yuan. Buyers struggled, and retail investors supported and bought, with the minimum price being 6,320 yuan. It was not until after 11:15 that news arrived from abroad, and a wave of short covering suddenly arose. Yiyuan, Decheng, Gongda, Dafeng, Yida, Hengji, and retail investors all came to buy. The foreign exchange market turned weak, and prices gradually rose, surging 60 yuan, reaching 6,380 yuan. However, Chengji, Yida, and Xiangxingyong strongly suppressed the price, and Hengji re-emerged, pushing the price down to 6,360 yuan. Soon, Kangyong, Defu, and Mingfeng came to compete to buy, and at 11:55, the price rose to 6,383 yuan. Xinfengyong released more goods, returning the price down to 6,375 yuan. The market closed at noon at 6,376 yuan, a rise of 14 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Based on the settlement price of the June US dollar at 5.4375, this was 6,404.6 yuan, a decrease of 28.6 yuan. After the close, the price rose to 6,380 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 63 yuan in the half-day. There was no market in the afternoon. The gold shop's selling price of gold was 380 yuan higher than the unofficial futures price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price.

Jewelry Gold Initially Low, then High

The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael at Datonghang and Xinhang was 690 yuan at 10 am, a decrease of 5 yuan. By 12 pm, it returned up and was listed at 695 yuan, with buying reduced by 40 yuan.

### Chickens

— Wei Gan

When I was in Beiping, the painter Qi Baishi gifted me a painting of chicks, so lively and realistic. I especially loved the down on the chicks, which he rendered in light ink, so tender and caressable. I've lived with it day and night for ten years, which has made me especially fond of chicks. Now these chicks are jumping concretely on the grass in front of me, making嘤嘤 sounds, so endearing. I watch them grow every day, and I see that they know to hide in the grass or run into the house whenever an eagle flies over the roof, and a smile of full pleasure often appears on my face. Things may be small, but they all have the instinct to protect life. The power of creation is truly incredible.

With plenty of wild food, they grow especially fast, their feathers become abundant, and the males and females can be distinguished. Useless things in the world, though spurned by people, are able to preserve themselves; conversely, pillars of society are bound to be felled, and useful things will eventually be exploited. Alas, these chicks, as soon as the males and females can be distinguished, are at the point where their death is a foregone conclusion. And the humans who hold the power of their life and death at this time only know how to plan for themselves, placing the lives of the chicks outside of their concerns.

The first thing we think of at this time is the uselessness of the roosters. Grown roosters, though beautiful, are not tasty, and they cannot produce. At most, we only leave one rooster to reproduce, and the rest are arranged to be killed and eaten while their bones are still soft and their meat is tender. Stir-fried chicken is indeed a famous dish to go with wine.

Of the chickens we raised, four were roosters, and all were slaughtered one after another under this foreordained fate because the master had guests. Finally, only one particularly lucky rooster was left, roaming with a flock of hens in front of and behind our house. At this time, our mood changed completely. We all looked at them with a utilitarian eye. The era of the chicks in the paintings had long passed. They are no longer beautiful, they have long lost their ability to attract, they have neither artistic nor poetic appeal. Their only contribution to humanity at this time is to develop their female instinct, to produce as much as possible, to provide a constant supply under humanity's knife.

Every day in my spare time from class, I look at this flock of chickens in the yard and have a feeling in my heart.

"Look, isn't this polygamy?" One day I inadvertently said this to my wife.

"You men all hope for polygamy, so you pay attention to it. I never thought that chickens were also polygamous," she replied in a mocking tone.

"But this kind of polygamy is not a natural law, but an artificial creation. Because of this, I think that the same thing happens in humans, but that is only the ambition of a few men, not the ambition of ordinary men; and those few men themselves are not necessarily polygamous, but they hope that the men under their rule are all polygamous."

"What do you mean? Since you are not a polygamist yourself, how do you hope that others will be polygamists?" she asked.

"Isn't it very simple? The facts are right in front of us, and everyone can see it clearly."

So I told her about the situation in totalitarian countries. I also asked her if she had forgotten the Italian story we saw in the London newspaper. It is said that once a mother brought eight children to a hotel in Rome to stay, and the hotel owner, seeing too many children, was afraid that they would disturb the other guests and refused to accommodate them. Later, when Mussolini heard about it, he ordered the hotel to be sealed. The reason was that the country was promoting childbirth and needed more men, and the hotel owner, what a clown, dared to dislike children, what a crime!

Now, the leaders of those totalitarian countries, because they have aggressive ambitions, need countless men to be cannon fodder, so they especially reward childbirth. Not only does the government reward mothers who have more than three sons, but also gives them subsidies. Even illegitimate children are officially recognized by the government. In short, in whatever way, as long as it can create more citizens for the country, it is good. Because in wartime, no matter how sophisticated the military equipment is, it is useless if there are not enough people. Military factories can produce in large quantities, but people must be born one by one from their mothers, and cannot be replenished temporarily. At least twenty years are needed to grow into a strong man for them to drive onto the battlefield.

Aggressors, seeing this, have already formed a kind of polygamy under the guise of rewarding childbirth, which is the same principle as our raising chickens. Since it rewards more sons and recognizes illegitimate children, this is naturally equivalent to promoting polygamy. And aren't the citizens produced under this reward the same as chickens? Once they grow up, they will be sent to slaughter. Writing this, I feel skeptical about the old saying that humans are the spirit of all things. (End)

### The Dog's Sneer

— Ping Jing

I had just walked into the lane when I saw a small bowl of rice on the ground. A fat dog was desperately and gleefully chewing away. He disregarded a thin, weak cat, who just secretly watched him, not daring to come closer to enjoy the delicious rice together.

Seeing this situation, I felt very indignant on behalf of the cat, and unbearably said, "You should share some with this poor cat!"

He ignored me and kept eating frantically.

I got angry and shouted, "You damn dog!"

He scorned me, emitting a cold laugh from his nostrils.

I was furious, "What a shameless dog, how dare you!"

Unexpectedly, he raised his head and coldly replied, "You humans are the most shameless animals in the world." At the same time, he smiled at me again.

"Bullshit, what did you say?" I couldn't be insulted by a dog.

"Humph! What? Don't pretend to be deaf. I said humans are the most shameless. Look, the rich people living in high-rise buildings still hoard rice, coal, silk, hoard…"

I was both scared and angry, and pretended not to hear and walked away.

But the hateful dog still shouted loudly, "They only know how to hoard, make a fortune, and disregard the millions of common people, they…"

I started to speed up my pace and ran, running home. I could only hear the triumphant dog still laughing loudly.

"Woo, woo, woo," the factory whistle woke me up. I touched the sweat on my head, and it turned out to be a dream!

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(8) Tangible Friendship

"I may be poor, but I have a big heart! For example, these past two weeks, I haven't been on stage once, haven't even received a single penny; but when Mei Bao was at her sickest, I still hired the most famous doctors for her, Chinese and Western medicine, changing them several times a day. And I still haven't put you in debt to anyone for it! This is my ability, you don't need to worry about me!"

"No wonder you don't drink or smoke. It's unfair that I owe you so much!" Autumn Begonia said, gently turning over in bed, "I originally wanted to wait for Seventh Master to collect my things and send them over, so everyone could..."

Before he could finish, Yu Kun already understood what he was going to say, and couldn't help but admit that he was right.

"That's right, these few days, those guys under you are probably going to cause trouble!" He slightly rolled up his sleeves, which had at least four or five holes. "Rong Kui, that kid, is the first one you can't trust! It's a good thing you don't have a wife at home to support, otherwise, he would definitely take her away!"

Autumn Begonia was helpless about his senior brother always joking, no matter the time or place.

He turned over on the pillow again, his mind racing.

"Second Brother, has Mei Bao fully recovered?"

"Of course! Just now I was helping her walk two slow laps in the courtyard!"

"That's good!" Autumn Begonia said with a slight smile, "Second Brother, since that's the case, please go back and take a look! Maybe it's still not too late. And I'm really worried about what happened to Seventh Master. If you go, you can find a way to see him."

Yu Kun didn't answer immediately, and hesitated for a long time with his head down.

"To be honest, I really don't want to go to the capital! Think about it, it's best to send another group of people!" (118)

### Firemen Looking Like Ghosts and Monsters

— Ke Zhong

Readers may find these monsters in the picture strange. In fact, these are not the humans from Mars mentioned in fantasy novels, nor are they the "ghosts" dancing in Tibetan temple fairs. They are personnel from the British Fleet Air Arm's ordnance factory, wearing asbestos suits that help them rescue personnel from crashed and burning aircraft, and also help extinguish fires on warships carrying aircraft.

### The Development of the Dionne Quintuplets' Personalities

— Xin Ying

The world-famous quintuplets who have appeared on the screen are now a full seven years old. Time flies so fast, and the quintuplets are completely different from what we saw on the screen back then. Here, I will briefly write about the recent personality changes of the quintuplets.

Among the quintuplets, Émilie is the most mischievous little girl. When Dr. Dafoe, who was in charge of guardianship, gave them five pairs of galoshes, he told them that these shoes were for wearing on rainy days. But she would think of wearing galoshes and stepping into the bathtub to take a bath. Indeed, she always comes up with all kinds of games, and even when educating them, she is the most skeptical.

Émilie and Marie were the smallest and weakest of the quintuplets at birth. But in terms of strength and activity, they slowly caught up with their older sisters. They have a habit of constantly paying attention to their older sisters, especially Marie, who bravely imitates her sisters' actions. But she can't ride a bicycle as fast as her older sisters, but she knows how to ride. She constantly asks questions about nature, animals, and everything else. Everything shows that she knows how to use her brain. So perhaps she will become a teacher in the future!

Yvonne and Annette have shown that they are very qualified to be leaders. They will act as protectors for their other sisters among the quintuplets. Yvonne has a stronger personality. Among the quintuplets, she is the easiest to make friends with visitors. And she is most confident in her own actions. People believe that in the future, in her class, people will vote for her and elect her as leader, and she may become a businesswoman.

Annette is the last to admit when she fails at something. But in any event, even if it is not yet successful, she will first express optimism and boast about it. Xin Ying

Cécile is like a surgeon, with a very beautiful carriage and a very natural attitude. She also shows great talent for music. Usually, she sings alone and dances a few steps, and as long as she hears the radio and record player playing music, she dances involuntarily. In the future, she may become a musician or inventor.

Currently, all the quintuplets' school education is handled by a full-time teacher, and supervised by the Ontario Board of Education. Religious education is also being promoted. They do morning and evening prayers and go to church every Sunday to worship. In short, the five girls are becoming more and more lively.

### Brief News from the Art World

— Wen

Zhu Shilin's new work after "Princess Bi Luo" has been decided to be a costume fantasy film "Dragon's Blood Tiger's Blood". The female lead was originally scheduled to be Wang Xichun, but because Wang refused to make costume films, it has been decided to hire Yang Yin instead.

The Oriental Hotel Drama Theater has decided to implement a reorganization on June 1st and has invited Zhou Chu, Zhou Qi, Lu Si, Mao Peng, etc. to serve as special directors. As for the ten famous plays that have been publicized for a long time, it has also been decided to start performing them in order from June 10th. The plays include "Midnight Song," "Living in a Dream," "Telling Lies," "The Misanthrope," "Wedding Night," "Shanghai Like This," "Tears Like Rain," "Ideal Wife," etc.

Fang Peilin's play "Swallow Cuts Spring Sorrow", which was planned to be filmed after "Silver Spear Bandit", was not approved when the script was secretly reviewed, so Fang has decided to abandon the play and prepare to film a martial arts film. It is said that the film has been named "White Orchid".

Zhang Huichong, the male lead of "Silver Spear Bandit", has decided to perform "Large-Scale Magic" at the Lyceum Theatre in this city in early June for two weeks. If the box office results are good, he will continue to perform at the Great Shanghai Theatre after the autumn cools down.

Li Hong's new play "Where Does the Soul Return" is actually adapted from the book "The Lost Lamb" by the famous writer Yu Dafu. It is rumored that the script was written by Liu Qiong, which is a misrepresentation.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 1 The First Glimpse of Gongsun's Sword Qi

When Xu Jinggang reached out to draw the treasured sword from his back, he couldn't help but be shocked! It turned out that only an empty scabbard remained on his back. The Crimson Phoenix treasured sword, which he cherished all his life, had suddenly disappeared! He calmed his mind and thought. When he left the Liu family, he had clearly carried the sword on his back. How could it suddenly be gone here? Could it be a ghost touching his head? He usually didn't believe in ghosts and gods, and even if there were ghosts, they wouldn't dare to tease him, Xu Jing. Perhaps someone had stolen it when he wasn't paying attention. However, he had been vigilant all the way, and no one had seen him. When did that person take the Crimson Phoenix Sword? If so, then that person's skill is not small, far above his own. But besides Wang Yongtai, no one else here is good at martial arts. Then this matter is very surprising. This Crimson Phoenix Sword is his beloved object, and it was not easy to obtain. Now it has suddenly disappeared for no reason, and it happened in an instant. How can he not investigate thoroughly in order to get the pearl back? So he left the adulterous couple in the room to find the person who stole his treasured sword. Fortunately, they were sound asleep and would not wake up until dawn. Let them enjoy a moment of pleasure. Immediately, he turned back, flew onto the roof, and looked around. Because it was a dark night and his night vision was poor, he couldn't see very clearly in the distance. It seemed that there was a black shadow flashing far ahead, and he hurriedly chased after it. He saw that the black shadow was running away as if flying. He thought to himself that there was indeed an outsider. His Crimson Phoenix Sword must have been stolen by that person, so he quickened his pace to chase. The black shadow only ran backwards, and soon reached the outer wall behind the house, and floated down. Xu Jing thought that he had escaped, how could he give up? He followed and jumped down. But when he jumped to the ground, he couldn't see the black shadow he was chasing anymore. He walked a few steps forward, the deep alley was quiet, and there was no one in sight. Occasionally, there were one or two dogs barking, as fierce as leopards. Xu Jing stood still, feeling extremely puzzled. He blamed himself for being too negligent. How could he not have felt anything when someone stole the treasured sword from his back? Isn't this the biggest joke in the world? Where did the black shadow go? It can be seen that that person's skills are several times stronger than his own. Even if he caught up with him, how could he ask him to return the treasured sword? If he was willing to return it, why would he steal it? In short, he was too unskilled, extremely ashamed. Then should he return to Weifeng Mountain? But he couldn't explain it to himself. (75)

### Summary of the Philosophy of Practical Action

All service has value. As long as you do it well, do it practically, and do it with real results, and society truly benefits, then any kind of service has value. Service only asks for efficiency, not kind, not size.

### High Birthday Celebration

— Xiepu Guest

Mr. Gao Lansheng, a prominent figure in Shanghai, is an outstanding talent from Kuaiji. He has a chivalrous heart and a gentle nature. He is enthusiastic about public welfare and loves to do good deeds. He is proficient in trade (dealing in jade and jewelry), good at socializing, and likes to help the poor and weak. Therefore, he has thousands of followers and a good reputation. The 25th of this month was Mr. Gao's 40th birthday. Celebrations from all walks of life were held at the Lido Garden. I was fortunate enough to be a guest. I enjoyed famous plays and the pleasure of sight and hearing. The plays included Xiaoba Su Lian's "Magu Offering Longevity," Guo Kunquan's "Golden Knife Array," Yan Shishan's "Peach Banquet," Xiao Linghong, Liu Binkun, and Han Jinkui's "Playing Flower Drum," Li Zhonglin, Gao Xuezhao, Wang Shaolou, and Chen Xiaomu's "Iron Rooster," Xue Youling's "Female Escort," Bai Su Lian's "Flower Field Mistake," Gai Sansheng's "Sending Off the Bride," Gao Baisui's "Chasing Han Xin," Yu Jimei's (famous amateur) "Meilong Town," Sun Junqing's "Mount Dingjun," and the grand finale was the famous actor Zhao Ruquan's "Celebrating the Yellow Riding Jacket," Yan Jupeng's "Ascending to the Heavenly Altar," and Xun Huisheng's "Hongluan Joy". Every play was wonderful, and every play was the masterpiece of famous amateurs and actors. All the performers were energetic, singing and acting vigorously, so that the Lido dance floor was crowded with people. Listeners were shoulder-to-shoulder, flocking in droves, it can be called an unprecedented grand occasion. When famous artists performed, Yan Zaitang led his staff to film the movie, the lights were shining brightly, luxurious and magnificent, which added a lot of color.
