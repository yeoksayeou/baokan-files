### Continued Success of Chinese Forces in Western Hubei: Breaking into Shashi, Encircling Dangyang; Highways between Hankou-Yichang, Jingmen-Dangyang, and Shashi-Jingmen Cut by Chinese Forces; Street Battles Unresolved in Yichang City as Japanese Troops Prepare to Clear Out

Chongqing – According to Chinese military dispatches, the Chinese forces sweeping through the urban area of Yichang have mostly cleared out the Japanese troops, with the remaining Japanese unable to escape and still fighting a desperate battle in the eastern corner of the city, where they are expected to be annihilated soon. Another unit of Chinese forces briefly broke into Shashi yesterday, and the Japanese troops in the Dangyang area are also under encirclement. All the highways between Hankou-Yichang, Jingmen-Dangyang, and Shashi-Jingmen have been cut by the Chinese forces. The war situation in western Hubei continues to develop in startling ways.

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman stated this morning at a special reception for journalists that the Chinese forces had entered Yichang city yesterday, but suffered considerable casualties due to Japanese air raids. Over thirty Japanese planes bombed Yichang yesterday, dropping more than three hundred bombs. The Chinese forces suffered a total of four battalions of casualties, including the death of one battalion commander and the injury of three battalion commanders. When a reporter asked whether the Chinese forces had the ability to completely occupy and defend Yichang, the spokesman replied that, in terms of all military factors, he could solemnly answer in the affirmative. However, if the Japanese military used bombs on a large scale, the Chinese forces would have no adequate protection against them. The spokesman strongly condemned the Japanese military for violating all principles of international law and humanitarianism. The spokesman also stated that street battles were still ongoing, and it was estimated that there were about one thousand Japanese troops in Yichang city and two outposts in the suburbs. It would be no problem for the Chinese forces to disarm this small number of troops, but the only concern for the Chinese forces was the Japanese bombing. The total number of Japanese troops in Yichang and its surrounding area was about ten thousand. Their 13th Division had retreated from Yichang to participate in the offensive against northern Hunan. The Chinese forces began to enter Yichang after 3:00 AM yesterday. All the military outposts in the suburbs, including the airfield, were practically occupied by the Chinese forces. The Chinese forces engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops at Nanjin Pass, northeast of the suburbs. The Chinese forces that entered Yichang were units of the 9th and 13th Divisions. The Chinese forces had also recovered many military outposts in Yichang, including Daming Mountain (transliteration). An entire Japanese battalion was wiped out. The Chinese forces are now advancing on Longquanyi and Shuanglian Temple, 18 kilometers east of Yichang. Both locations are on the transportation line between Yichang and Dangyang. Dangyang is northeast of Yichang and is practically surrounded by the Chinese forces. (11th Reuters dispatch)

Hankou – According to foreign military sources here, the Chinese forces launched a fierce blitzkrieg attack on Yichang, breaking through the Japanese outer defenses and then attacking Yichang city with full force, advancing north along the line to Jingmen. This time, the Chinese forces fully utilized small, convenient military equipment and artillery. Now, the Japanese forces, unable to resist the situation, have quickly increased reinforcements to Yichang. Military experts generally believe that the Chinese offensive against Yichang is not a large-scale general counteroffensive, but rather aimed at wiping out the Japanese troops in Yichang in one fell swoop during the arrival of the US military delegation led by Major General Magruder in Chongqing, in order to show that if the Chinese forces receive a large amount of US military assistance, they can be sure of victory in implementing a general counteroffensive. (11th dispatch)

Chongqing – According to Chinese military telegrams, after a fierce offensive, the Chinese forces have entered the city and occupied Yichang. The Japanese forces are now trying desperately to salvage the situation, increasing reinforcements for a counteroffensive, and sending thirty planes to drop many bombs on the Chinese forces inside Yichang city. (11th dispatch)

Chongqing – The Central Army completely occupied Yichang today. (11th United Press dispatch)

Chongqing – Food officials here recently told a United Press reporter that after the recovery of Yichang, the economic life of Free China will immediately benefit significantly, and the panic of food shortages can be greatly alleviated. They also stated that the price of rice in Sichuan is expected to continue to fall. Since the fall of Yichang two years ago, rice from Hunan could not pass through the Yangtze River front line, causing a great panic in the Sichuan rice supply. Now that Yichang has been recovered, Free China's rice transport routes from Hunan to western Hubei, southern Henan, and the old routes in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces are expected to be open again. (11th United Press dispatch)

Chongqing – This morning, a military spokesman hosted foreign reporters and reported on the Yichang battle, which was largely the same as the news reports. He said that Yichang was originally garrisoned by the Japanese 13th Division, but after this division was found in northern Hunan, it was known that Yichang must be relatively empty. The Chinese forces then launched an offensive to contain them. As a result of continuous battles, the outer outposts fell into the hands of the Chinese forces one after another. As of now, only Xiba in the river and Dongdao Mountain on the west bank still have a small number of Japanese troops. The Japanese troops fighting in the streets of Yichang city are also less than two thousand. In terms of strength, it is not difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. (11th Havas dispatch)

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman announced that the Chinese 9th Division entered Yichang at 3:10 AM yesterday. After entering the city, they immediately engaged in fierce street battles with the Japanese garrison, which continued until now. The Japanese troops surrounded in the city number about two thousand, and their retreat to Hankou has been cut off. Chinese troops have now occupied all the major highlands and positions around Yichang, as well as the airfield. According to the Central News Agency, the fate of the Japanese troops in Yichang has been decided. The Japanese troops are holding several buildings in the city, and a small Japanese unit is holding a certain place on the south bank opposite Yichang. The Chinese forces are now completely cutting off the Japanese military on the Hankou-Yichang highway and are also trying to prevent the Japanese from reinforcing Yichang. (10th United Press dispatch)

They are now conducting a mopping-up operation against the Japanese troops. (10th dispatch)

Yichang Battlefield – The Chinese army entered the city through Gumen Street at dawn this morning, and fierce street battles broke out once.

### Chairman Chiang's Message to the Nation's Military and Civilians on National Day: At a Time When the Revolution is Succeeding and Victory is in Sight, Compatriots Should Exert Their Utmost Abilities to Achieve Complete Success

Chongqing – Chairman Chiang issued a message to the nation's military and civilians on the Double Tenth Festival of the 30th year of the Republic of China. The original text is recorded as follows: "Today is the 30th anniversary of the revolutionary uprising of our Republic of China. The ancients said, 'Thirty years is a generation.' Looking back on the glory of the struggle of the revolutionary martyrs and thinking of the great future of our Republic of China, all our compatriots should encourage themselves, strive forward, and continue to advance, so as not to fail the difficulties of our Founding Father's creation and to complete the legacy of our martyrs. I have always said that our country's revolution has two meanings, internal and external, and its process is divided into the early and later stages. The revolution in the early stage lies in removing obstacles and completing the unification of the country. The cause in the later stage lies in washing away national humiliation and seeking independence, freedom, and equality for our country. For the past five years, thanks to the concerted efforts of the military and civilians throughout the country, we have been able to lay the foundation for victory, and the credibility of our country has increased day by day, thus forming cooperation with friendly nations. There are two most memorable events in this year: one is that the great righteousness of international peace has become clearly visible, and the anti-aggression front has become increasingly distinct; the second is that our country has entered a stage of equal international status. China, due to the autocratic rule of foreign races, misgovernment, and mis-education, invited foreign insults, resulting in the constraints of all unequal treaties, which began in the spring of 1840 AD (the 20th year of Daoguang). It has now been exactly one hundred years, and the United States and the United Kingdom have both declared this year that they would abandon all privileges in China and revise treaties with us on the basis of free and equal negotiations. On the day of the restoration of peace in the Far East, the long-cherished wish of a century will be fulfilled at once, and our Founding Father's lifelong aspiration to abolish unequal treaties has now achieved the first step of success. This is truly a cause for great celebration, but it still requires the continued efforts of all our compatriots to achieve success. Looking at history, we see that the rise and fall of a country is always determined by the vigor and diligence of its people. Those whose people's will is united and vigorous will prosper, while those who are scattered and follow the old ways will perish. Therefore, if a country has a bright future, the will and efforts of its people must not be trivialized in momentary, selfish, short-sighted disputes, but should be a long-term vision for thousands of generations to come. Now our country's great cause of resistance and national construction is just beginning, and there is still time for struggle. Our soldiers throughout the country should be even more valiant, attacking the strong and defeating the firm, creating glorious achievements, so as to fulfill our country's responsibility in the world's democratic camp. Our people throughout the country should endure hardships and difficulties, continue to strive, sacrifice individuals, contribute to the country, strictly implement the National Covenant, and obey wartime laws, so as to fulfill the responsibility of wartime citizens. Our intellectuals and social leaders throughout the country must face reality squarely, recognize the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, take on the great responsibility of the rise and fall of the world, and advocate that compatriots devote themselves to production and dedicate themselves to science, so as to lay the foundation for national defense and enrich the economy, overcome all difficulties and dangers, and establish the guarantee of victory. Our personnel at all levels throughout the country should be invigorated and encourage each other, without a moment of following the old ways, without a trace of negligence, being precise and truthful, and always faithful and loyal, eliminating old accumulated malpractices, improving political efficiency, and rapidly completing all grassroots construction, so as to increase combat power and establish a national construction model. In short, our compatriots throughout the country should deeply remember the Founding Father's former saying that 'the Chinese revolution can succeed in thirty years.' We, at this point, are ashamed that we have not been able to fulfill our duties and achieve what was expected, but we firmly believe that the foundation of the complete success of our national revolution has been laid here, which is undoubtedly undeniable. At this time when the revolution is succeeding and victory is in sight, all our compatriots should be especially vigilant, exerting their abilities and fulfilling their responsibilities, working diligently to achieve complete success. Otherwise, a little slackness will inevitably lead to failure, and then we will not only be unable to face the countless martyrs who sacrificed for the country, but we will also have nothing to atone for the sins of our nation for hundreds of generations. On this glorious 30th anniversary of National Day, I am willing to join my compatriots throughout the country in looking back at the great achievements of the Wuchang Uprising, and to make a solemn pledge to our Founding Father, the revolutionary martyrs, and the heroic souls of the military and civilians who died in the war, to do our best to achieve the goal of realizing our ambitions."

### Chinese Forces in Northern Hunan Cross the Xinqiang River and Advance to the Southeastern Suburbs of Yueyang; Dashaping North of Tongcheng Reported Recovered

Chongqing – The main force of the Chinese pursuing troops crossed the north bank of the Xinqiang River yesterday and marched towards Yueyang, unstoppable. Taolin, Xitang, and other places were recovered. As of the time of this dispatch, a vanguard unit of the Chinese forces had advanced to the southeastern suburbs of Yueyang. Dashaping, north of Tongcheng, was also recovered by the Chinese forces yesterday. The Japanese troops on the Hunan-Hubei border are in great chaos. (11th dispatch)

Changsha – The Chinese forces pursuing north across the Xinqiang River occupied strongholds such as Taolin, Xitang, and Guankou southeast of Yueyang on the morning of the 9th. At the same time on the 7th, another unit of Chinese forces launched a fierce attack on Chongyang and Dashaping in southern Hubei, also making smooth progress. (9th dispatch)

Changsha – The troops occupying various strongholds southeast of Yueyang launched fierce attacks on Yueyang and Linxiang on the morning of the 10th, achieving considerable success. (10th dispatch)

Details of the Japanese Troops' Retreat in Northern Hunan

A spokesman for the Chongqing Military Commission stated that the battle situation this week was very complex and subtle. The Japanese and Chinese forces were attacking and defending each other, with mutual cause and effect, resulting in mutual casualties, gains, and losses. Overall, the Japanese military suffered more losses and casualties. The Chinese forces lost ground but could immediately recover it, and the field was lost but could immediately be replenished. Moreover, the Japanese military was showing signs of decline, while the Chinese forces' morale was high. This is why the Japanese military failed and the Chinese forces were able to recover several strongholds. In order to deceive the great powers and show that it still had the strength to attack, the Japanese military launched the battle in northern Hunan. Although its forces were still insufficient, it boldly drew troops from Hubei and Henan to quickly invade southward in an attempt to achieve success. Fearing that its goal would not be easily achieved, it simultaneously launched an offensive in central Guangdong to contain the Chinese forces. The Chinese military saw through its plan and, in addition to luring the Japanese isolated forces deep into the country and intercepting them step by step, launched offensives in western Hubei, northern Hubei, and southern Henan to take advantage of its weakness and attack its rear. Wherever the military vanguard arrived, it repeatedly captured important places, so the Japanese military was shocked and ordered a retreat. The tragic situation was unprecedented. Fearing that it would be difficult to break through and prevent the Chinese forces from launching a counterattack, it also initiated the battle in central Henan to contain the Chinese forces on the western section of the Longhai Railway. As of the 9th, although the Japanese military had entered Zhengzhou city, its great defeat in Changsha and the loss of strongholds in western Hubei, northern Hubei, and southern Henan, trapping it in an encircled situation, was the Japanese military's predetermined fate. Regarding the details of the Battle of Changsha, I announced last week that the Japanese military began to retreat northward in three routes on the 2nd, and was intercepted by the Chinese military along the way. On the 3rd and 4th, many Japanese troops were annihilated in Jinjing, Fulinpu, Sanjieqiao, Mafengzui, Lukoushe, and other places. Horses and supplies were abandoned on the road, and only a part of the wounded soldiers were transported away in Yingtian. On the 5th, 6th, and 7th, the vanguard of the Japanese military had reached the south bank of the Xinqiang River, and was still being intercepted by various units of the Chinese military. The Chinese forces on the south bank are now clearing the battlefield, and there are no traces of the Japanese south of the Miluo River. The Chinese forces supporting the battle in northern Hunan, with various units in northern Hubei and southern Henan, made rapid progress. After achieving their goals, they successively recovered Yichang, Zhongxiang, Suixian, Xinyang and other important strongholds near the county towns, and destroyed important roads such as the Pinghan, Xianghua, and Hanyi railways. As for the operation launched by the Japanese military to contain the Chinese forces on the western section of the Longhai Railway, except for the middle route that had rushed into Zheng County, where it is currently fighting the Chinese forces in the suburbs, the left and right routes are still being blocked by the Chinese forces in the area south of Rongze and west of Zhongmu. (10th dispatch)

Chongqing – According to a telegram from General Xue Yue, the Japanese military crossed the Xinqiang River and retreated northward again on Wednesday night. There are now no traces of the Japanese military on the south bank of the Xinqiang River. At present, both sides are still confronting each other on the original positions before the Japanese military launched its offensive on September 17, which is about 90 miles north of Changsha. The Chinese vanguard crossing the Xinqiang River has advanced to areas near Dayun Mountain and other locations. Residents of Changsha informed a Reuters reporter yesterday about the situation of a Japanese press corps flying over Changsha, saying that when the battle situation was tense, most residents took refuge in the empty courtyard of the German and Italian churches. German and Italian missionaries organized these refugees and gathered them in the square. When the Japanese press corps flew overhead, the missionaries ordered the crowd to wave to the sky. Later, when the overall situation stabilized, the Hunan Provincial Government ordered the expulsion of these missionaries because they were taking advantage of the dangerous situation to carry out malicious activities. Twelve people have already left Changsha and met with the press corps in Xiangtan on Wednesday morning. According to reports, after the National Government severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy, German and Italian missionaries were still allowed to stay in China, but they had to abide by Chinese laws. Now that the German and Italian missionaries in Changsha have taken this pro-Japanese action, it is feared that the status of other German and Italian missionaries in Free China will be adversely affected.

Editorial

### The Ultimate Trend of the International Situation

The war situations in Europe and Asia, which are the focus of attention for people all over the world today, are both unfolding rapidly. Although both are life-and-death struggles between aggressors and anti-aggressors, the current situation shows a distinction in terms of urgency and positive/negative aspects. In particular, the Far East battlefield is very stable due to the brave fighting of the Chinese army. Moreover, based on the major victories in the recent battles of Changsha and Yichang, it is foreseeable that the period of seeing the light after the fog is not far away. On the contrary, the situation in Moscow has become very serious in the European theater in recent days due to the gradual retreat of the Red Army in the central region. Therefore, the entire European war situation is far less stable and optimistic than the situation in the Far East. Although the violence of the East may still take advantage of the changes in the European situation to engage in some kind of reckless action, given the preparedness of the ABCD united front in the Pacific and the great achievements recently demonstrated by the Chinese army, it is believed that even if the Asian battlefield expands in the future, the possibility of the civil rights front using united forces to extinguish the fierce flames is still greater than in Europe.

The current situation in the two war zones of Europe and Asia, one tense and one relaxed, one dangerous and one stable, is as described above. However, in terms of the final trend, we still firmly believe that there is only one, in other words, we still firmly believe that it will still be impossible to escape the extension of public justice and the disillusionment of power and violence. The future of Asia will certainly be like this, and the fate of Europe must also be like this. Even if the Red Army continues to retreat in the future, or even abandons Moscow, as long as the entire civil rights front adheres to its position, is determined to thoroughly establish the goal of permanent peace, and is determined to continue fighting with united forces to protect its own freedom and security, then one day, the final victory will still come to the tenacious fighters for civil rights.

The most terrifying thing is defection midway, and the easiest thing to lead to failure is disrupting one's own ranks. However, no matter from what perspective we observe, these dangers of defection or internal strife do not seem to exist among the four countries of China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States today. China and the Soviet Union are bleeding and fighting bravely, and both are determined to fight to the end, so there is no need to mention it. As for Britain and the United States, although some outsiders have criticized their slow actions or even suspected their ulterior motives, if we think about it calmly, it is not difficult to find that Britain and the United States are actually sharing the same fate as China and the Soviet Union. Because if China and the Soviet Union are defeated, Britain will also be defeated. If China, Britain, and the Soviet Union are all defeated, then the United States will hardly be spared! President Roosevelt's self-appointment to assist civil rights countries is based on this understanding. And the Churchill government's decisive conclusion of an alliance with the Soviet Union is also to express its shared fate. Therefore, in any case, we do not have to doubt the basic policies of Britain and the United States. The only thing worth criticizing, and indeed should be criticized, is the overly cautious attitude of Britain and the United States. For example, Britain still cannot take direct action to restrain the Nazi army, which is attacking the Soviet Union with all its strength. Not only does this make third parties feel dissatisfied, but British public opinion itself has also risen to criticize it. Similarly, although the United States has decided to provide massive aid to China, it is still conducting so-called exploratory talks with Japan intermittently. This is also an unreasonable action that is highly criticized today. Although Britain may have practical difficulties in launching an offensive in Northern Europe, the Near East, or Africa, if Britain disregards success or failure, identifies the opponent's weaknesses, and takes a risk, it may not necessarily fail in fact. Not only will it not fail, but it may have already had a considerable effect spiritually. Similarly, although the United States' continuous talks with Japan may have a deeper meaning of delaying time, if it were straightforward and refused to engage in this unnatural diplomatic contact with Japan, in fact, Japan, which has been diplomatically isolated, economically exhausted, and has no opportunity to take advantage of the international situation in the past two months, probably would not dare to act recklessly. Conversely, if there is a drastic change in the international situation in the future, causing the Japanese radicals to be tempted again, then even if there is a scene of US-Japan talks, it may not be able to suppress Japan's ambitions for expansion. In short, although we have no doubts about the basic policies of Britain and the United States, we believe that there is room for discussion on the two countries' actual actions to deal with the current crisis, especially the Soviet war, and we are convinced that it is necessary to catch up quickly.

I remember that the eighth point in the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration solemnly declared that "the United Kingdom and the United States believe that for the sake of permanent peace, it is necessary to disarm all countries that use military forces on land, sea, and air to invade and threaten." This is the most fundamental way to cut off the fuel under the cauldron and eradicate the source of trouble. Since Roosevelt and Churchill are willing to clearly list it in their historical declaration, it proves that they are determined to thoroughly implement this belief. However, we cannot help but ask: What effective methods will be used to disarm these militaristic countries? Can Hitler be disarmed by sitting back and watching the Soviet Union fight alone? Can Japan be made to sink its fleet out of thin air by talking to Japan? We believe that since Roosevelt and Churchill have boldly made this revelation, they must have a plan in their hearts that is sufficient to realize this ideal. With the insight of Roosevelt and Churchill, they will certainly not just shout some high-sounding slogans, or just rely on the individual efforts of China and the Soviet Union to "sit back and enjoy the fruits," because if they do, it will not only be disloyal to the entire civil rights front, but also endanger the security of their own countries. Therefore, we can believe that in the plans of Roosevelt and Churchill, there must be other specific methods to implement this ideal. In fact, to be frank, there is no better way to disarm other countries than to use force oneself and engage in combat. In other words, in addition to disarming the other party through military action, everything else is nonsense. Therefore, our conclusion is that although the final trend of the two war zones in Europe and Asia will not be able to escape the extension of justice, in order to realize this trend, China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and all other civil rights countries must work together, take up arms as a whole, and use military force and actual war to disarm the other party. This is true in East Asia, and it is also true in Europe.

### Southeast Asian Countries Have Formed an Economic Barrier That Cannot Be Broken by Axis Forces - A Powerful Chinese Air Force Will Soon Appear

Reuters, Manila, 11th - Grady, the US special economic investigator in the Far East, told reporters here yesterday that during his visit to Southeast Asia, he had obtained a guarantee that military raw materials in Southeast Asia would not be delivered to the Axis countries. The Philippines, China, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, and Ceylon have all stated that they will strive to increase production and deliver some important military supplies to Britain and the United States as soon as possible. In the next few weeks, China will have a sufficiently effective air force, which will be entirely composed of American aircraft. There is no atmosphere of appeasement towards Japan in Southeast Asia. If Japan does not invade by land, it will not be able to make the Burma Road lose its effectiveness, and it may not be possible for Japan to advance by land. The United States will increase its supply to Southeast Asia and guarantee the absorption of any increase in production. The Southeast Asian countries have now jointly formed a great economic group, which the Axis countries cannot break without using force. In other words, this is the solution to the collapse of Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere and the victory of Britain and the United States in the economic war against Japan. Japan is now trying to obtain a deceptive amount of unimportant rubber and tin from Thailand, and Thai officials are now gradually adopting a firm attitude towards Japan. The United States is now increasing its exports of military supplies to China and the Dutch East Indies in order to help create a parallel economic front, Grady said. Grady also said that the main problem in forming an economic group is transportation, and the US Maritime Commission is now seriously dealing with it.

United Press, Washington, 11th - Yesterday's editorial in "The Post" said, "The American people should stop and pay tribute to another country, because that country has resisted an aggressor for self-defense and has fulfilled its heroic obligation for the security of the United States in the Pacific." It also said, "China has caused various problems for the Japanese government and has created the first doubt in the empire's program. This is what their military experts have pursued and obtained."

Grady Denies the US Monopoly on Chinese Mineral Production

United Press, Manila, 10th - Grady recently arrived here from Hong Kong on a clipper and will leave here on the morning of the 12th to go to the United States. He will arrive in Washington on the 18th and submit his report to President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Secretary of Commerce Jones. Grady revealed that he has completed everything he planned and believes that his plan will help the national defense program and prevent the Axis countries from obtaining important raw materials. He also said that he has concluded agreements with Malaya and the Dutch East Indies on rubber and tin, an agreement with Ceylon on graphite, and an agreement with India on mica. He also said that the defense of the US, Britain, and the Netherlands in the Far East has been greatly enhanced, and he feels that there is no need to worry about aggression in the Far East. He also said that Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has assured him that China will quickly transport raw materials to the United States. The Burma Road currently transports 6,000 tons of goods per month, but the Chinese side expects that it can be increased to 10,000 tons by 1942. Grady praised President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife and deeply admired President Chiang Kai-shek's leadership ability. He said that during his conversation with President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, President Chiang Kai-shek assured him that China will achieve victory after the Battle of Changsha. Grady also denied the news spread by the Japanese that he had signed a 99-year mineral production agreement with the Chinese government.

Reuters, Washington, 11th - The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported that Grady has obtained the exclusive right for the United States to export all tungsten, tin, silver, and other metals from the free zone of China. Chinese officials here believe this is highly doubtful. China is currently transporting all mined tungsten to the United States to offset US loans and will continue to do so in the future. However, there has been no news here that the United States has requested this exclusive right, as the Japanese newspaper said. Even US officials here who have close ties with the purchase of Chinese metals cannot fully confirm the news from the Nichi Nichi Shimbun. According to their opinions, the US government is not engaged in mining and is not paying attention to the production of Chinese silver. It is clear that no information from Grady has been received here. An exclusive right for 99 years is such an important matter that it would inevitably require more negotiations and could not be done solely by Grady. Reuters learned that Grady's visit to China was to discuss several issues, which probably included how China could more quickly deliver its tin and other metals to the United States. Some quarters here believe that Grady is on the verge of breaking down, causing the peace talks here to actually come to a standstill. Although the talks have not been completely broken off, there is no chance of success unless there is a major change in Japan's attitude.

Washington, 10th - Famous American journalist Mauna recently commented on the US-Japan talks, saying that compromise between the US and Japan is impossible. Konoe's letter was extremely humble, while Roosevelt's reply only mentioned US principles and policies, which Japan cannot accept. He expressed optimism about the Soviet Union's resistance to Germany, saying that the Soviet Union will be able to defend Moscow.

United Press, Tokyo, 10th - Tokyo newspapers today strongly condemned the United States' participation in the encirclement of Japan. Some newspapers also fiercely attacked the United States. Kokumin Shimbun seemed to have resumed its fierce attacks on the United States after days of silence because it hated the news from Washington that Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies had completely stopped transporting oil to Japan. It is said that US-Japan talks will inevitably fail, and the deterioration of relations between the two countries is probably already inevitable. It is said that the priority of the United States to buy Chinese tungsten production has been discussed, and the exclusive rights mentioned in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun are not believed.

United Press, Tokyo, 11th - Deputy Cabinet Spokesman Ishii criticized the rumored 99-year agreement between China and the United States on the exploitation of mineral resources, saying that this news is only a "newspaper report and lacks official confirmation."

### US-Japan Talks at a Standstill, Compromise Is Impossible - Toyoda Uses Battleship to Metaphor Diplomacy - Tokyo Detains British Nationals, London Outraged

United Press, Washington, 11th - The domestic situation in Japan is serious. Military personnel and conservatives have no choice but to consider Japan's future policy.

United Press, Tokyo, 11th - Kokumin Shimbun reported today that Foreign Minister Toyoda said when talking about Japan's foreign policy, "Once a battleship has decided on a certain voyage and set sail, no matter what storms or raging waves it encounters, it must continue to move forward."

United Press, London, 11th - Authoritative circles here are extremely outraged by the continued detention of two British nationals by Tokyo's military police. It is believed that this is Japan's attempt to create a new Anglo-Japanese incident and damage US-Japan talks to the extent possible. The two detained British nationals are Mason and Malta.

### If the Soviet Union Unhappily Fails, Japan Will Go All In - The Allies Are Prepared to Fight

Reuters, Bombay, 11th - The Indian Times commented on the Far East situation, saying that if the Soviet Union suffers a disastrous defeat, Japan will definitely go to war. However, where it will start is a matter of speculation. If Japan is unwilling to risk war with the United States, it will attack the Soviet Union in order to seize Vladivostok, which it regards as a threat to its security. However, in order to bet everything on the victory of the Allies, Japan may launch a full-scale war. Therefore, for the sake of prudence, the Allies should be prepared to deal with all kinds of events in the Far East. Although officials have denied the scope of the Singapore conference held by Duff Cooper, the purpose of this conference is to coordinate the actions of the Allies and the United States in preparation for war with Japan. This is clearly obvious. India's interests in this matter are self-evident.

United Press, Tokyo, 10th - Ito, the head of the First Group of the First Section of the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, broadcast to the nation last night, saying that due to past developments, the war could spread to other regions at any time. He said that he specifically avoided commenting on the possible developments in the Pacific in the event of war. However, after reviewing the inability of the United Kingdom to control German submarines in the Atlantic, he said, "The United States' participation in the war will cause the destruction of culture and the interruption of maritime trade, and may even plunge the rich and abundant United States into stagnation."

### German Troops Launch Pincer Offensive and Invade Moscow - The Battle Line Extends to 300 Miles - Meets Fierce Resistance from the Red Army - Three Cities in Southern Ukraine Fall

Reuters, London, 11th - According to news received here, German troops continued to advance towards Moscow from the southwest. The Nazis are now developing two obvious offensives west of the Soviet capital, one is the offensive north of the Smolensk-Moscow railway line, which seems to be encircling eastward from Vyazma and advancing from Roslavl towards Yukhnov, which is 110 miles from Moscow. The other is an offensive further south, intending to break through along the line from Bryansk to Glukhov. As for how far the German army can take advantage of this offensive, it is still unknown. According to people here, a large number of Soviet divisions may have been surrounded in the above-mentioned offensive.

Reuters, London, 11th - Recent Soviet communiqués stated that there were particularly fierce battles in the Vyazma, Bryansk, and Melitopol areas. It was investigated that Vyazma and Bryansk were the attack sites of the German army's pincer offensive towards Moscow. London has confirmed that the German army occupied Melitopol on the Sea of Azov. It is reported that the German army has also captured two other cities in southern Ukraine, both near Bryansk and Melitopol. A large number of surrounded Soviet troops in the western area are resisting. The German offensive against Moscow is now expanding to a 300-mile-wide frontline. The German troops conducting the pincer offensive, whose northern route is eyeing Rzhev (70 miles north of Vyazma and 125 miles west of Moscow), and the southern route has reached the north of Orel (200 miles southeast of Moscow). These two main German forces have also dispatched small detachments to surround the Soviet army. The German side claimed that the encirclement of the Soviet army in the Bryansk area by the German army is gradually tightening. However, the Soviet side denied that Timoshenko's Soviet army has been surrounded. The British side reported that the German army has made little progress in these areas. The Soviet army seems to have stopped the German advance in the Orel area. New forces were transferred to the Vyazma area to assist in the battle. The people in the area are now fighting alongside the Soviet army. No changes have been reported in the battles of Odessa and Perekop Isthmus. The Soviet communiqué detailed the success of the Soviet air force in many battles, and stated that 39 German aircraft were destroyed on October 8, and 27 Soviet aircraft were lost.

Reuters, London, 11th - London claimed that the German army is currently advancing on Rzhev (northwest of Moscow). The frontline along which the German army launched its main offensive towards Moscow has been extended to more than 251 miles. In addition to the three main forces advancing and gradually encircling Moscow, the German army in Vyazma and Orel also appeared to be launching small-scale pincer movements. The London side described the German claim that the 70th Soviet Division had been surrounded in the Vyazma area as absurd. It has been confirmed that the German army has captured the three cities of Melitopol, Berdyansk, and Mariupol. Approximately a large number of Soviet troops have been surrounded due to the advance of the German army from the south and from the Sea of Azov. The German troops advancing on Kharkov from Poltava continued to encounter extremely resolute resistance and made slow progress.

Havas, London, 10th - The "Daily Mail" reported today that Stalin has flown from Moscow to the front line and is now at the headquarters of General Timoshenko, the commander-in-chief of the central front, to discuss strategy. Stalin's trip was very secretive.

### The Soviet Union Vows to Fight to the End and Its Belief in Victory is Growing Stronger - British and American Delegations Have Returned to London - Guaranteeing Effective Assistance to the Soviet Union as Much as Possible

United Press, London, 10th - Lord Beaverbrook and Averell Harriman, who led the British and American delegations to the Soviet Union, respectively, arrived here at 10:00 this morning.

Reuters, London, 11th - Harriman, the chief American representative attending the Moscow Tripartite Conference, told reporters yesterday after arriving here from the Soviet Union that there is no doubt about the Soviet government's determination to fight to the end and its belief in final victory. The United States is assisting in strengthening the railway through Iran to transport British and American supplies to the Soviet Union. The Soviet government is satisfied with the intentions of British and American aid to China and the effective expression of British and American aid to the Soviet Union. He left Moscow a week ago, so he could not comment on the current war situation. However, he knew that the Soviet leaders would lead their people to fight to the end. The Soviet Union's resistance has surprised the world's soldiers, and the reason for this is the Soviet people's ardent patriotism. Harriman was unwilling to elaborate on the supplies provided by the United States to the Soviet Union, but said that raw materials and military equipment were all included in the aid, and it was not just empty words to the Soviet Union.

Reuters, London, 11th - Lord Beaverbrook, the head of the British delegation attending the Moscow Tripartite Conference, is convinced that the Soviet Union will continue to fight even if Moscow falls, after meeting with Stalin in the Soviet capital. Beaverbrook said that British and American supplies, including tanks suitable for Soviet winter operations, have been continuously transported to the Soviet Union. The British supply of military equipment to the Soviet Union is based on a lend-lease basis. A large number of supplies originally intended to be shipped from the United States to the United Kingdom have been diverted to the Soviet Union. He was satisfied that the goods shipped by the United Kingdom could reach the Soviet border, and the Soviet Union was very pleased with the goods we shipped. The United Kingdom is happy to supply military equipment to the Soviet Union in accordance with the terms of the lease-lend, because we hope to treat the Soviet Union in the same way that we are treated ourselves. This was stipulated by the Prime Minister before he went to the Soviet Union. The lend-lease method is only used for military equipment and not for raw materials. The Soviet Union is very satisfied with our plan. We have been shipping supplies to the Soviet Union for a long time, and they are being shipped continuously, and several British aircraft squadrons are operating on one front. We have a large amount of equipment shipped to the Soviet Union. The purpose of the meeting was to determine the needs of the Soviet Union and the extent to which we can supply the Soviet Union. It is a mistake to think that the supplies will only be shipped to the Soviet Union after the meeting. The US played a very important role in the meeting, and the materials used in the war that the US supplied to the Soviet Union in accordance with the methods we agreed upon with the Soviet Union, if not exceeding the amount we supplied, are at least equal to those we supplied. I think that on the whole, the amount of supplies that the United States will ship to the Soviet Union in the future will eventually be greater than that shipped by the United Kingdom. The degree to which we are responsible for the supply is a very heavy burden on the UK's production capacity. Therefore, we must accelerate production in all aspects and do everything we can. In addition to shipping military equipment, we are also shipping a large number of raw materials suitable for manufacturing military equipment to the Soviet Union.

### Germany and Turkey Sign Trade Agreement - Industrial Products Exchanged for Raw Materials - Britain and Turkey Still Maintain Friendly Relations

Reuters, Berlin, 10th - The German official news agency said that the German-Turkish agreement signed yesterday stipulates that the two countries will exchange products worth approximately 200 million marks each within the period ending March 31, 1941. According to this agreement, Germany will supply Turkey with all the industrial products of most concern, especially the products of the steel industry and the iron manufacturing industry, and armaments are also included. Turkey will supply Germany with raw materials and food, especially cotton, tobacco, olive oil, and minerals.

Reuters, Istanbul, 10th - Turkish newspapers all used the newly released German-Turkish joint communiqué to confirm the German-Turkish declaration of friendship as the headline. However, the Vakit newspaper strongly stated that German-Turkish friendship does not hinder Anglo-Turkish friendship, and the alliance between the two countries remains as strong as ever.

### Joint Celebration of the Double Tenth Festival by the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government; Over Three Hundred Central Committee Members, Heads of Various Yuan (Branches of Government), and Ministries Attended; Chairman Lin Delivered an Address After Leading the Observance

Chongqing—This morning at nine o'clock, the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government jointly held a National Day celebration to commemorate the thirtieth year of the Republic of China at the National Government Auditorium. Over three hundred people attended, including Central Committee members, heads of various Yuan and Ministries, such as Wu Jingheng, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, and He Yingqin. After Chairman Lin led the observance, he delivered an impromptu address. The ceremony concluded around nine o'clock. The text of his address is recorded below:

Distinguished guests, from the Wuchang Uprising to the establishment of the Republic of China, it has been exactly thirty years today. As the war approaches its final victory, and on the occasion of such a sacred anniversary, I believe everyone feels exceptionally excited. The Republic of China has reached its thirtieth year, marking the end of the first phase. Reflecting on this phase of history, it is truly a history of nation-building. The founding of the Republic was merely the first step in nation-building. Since the establishment of the Republic, all our efforts have been directed towards this goal. Although progress has been uneven, and achievements have been both evident and subtle, and work has been sometimes intense and sometimes relaxed, the objective has always been nation-building. Dr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to leading everyone in the work of nation-building. President Chiang Kai-shek has inherited his great cause, leading everyone to continue striving in this direction. The purpose of the National Revolution is for nation-building, and the purpose of the war is also for nation-building. To build the nation, we must remove the obstacles to nation-building. The performance over the past four years and three months has fully confirmed our constant belief. Our military strength has become more substantial, and morale has been further boosted. The freezing of funds and the ban on oil exports by the United States and Great Britain are active economic measures to contain Japan. Speaking of our own country, not only has the sympathy of friendly nations increased, and their assistance broadened, but also the ties have become closer and cooperation has deepened. At the beginning of the war, we declared to the world that our war was not only for our own independence and survival, but also for safeguarding peace in East Asia. Safeguarding peace in East Asia means safeguarding world peace. Final victory will arrive in the near future. There is absolutely no doubt about this. The light is about to shine upon us, and we only need to raise our hands to welcome it. As we approach victory, mindful of the lesson that "ninety li is only halfway to one hundred," we must redouble our efforts, especially with regard to the work of nation-building, to which we must pay particular attention. The work of nation-building is complex, but fortunately we have Dr. Sun Yat-sen's entire legacy as the highest guiding principle, and the "Program for Resistance and Nation-Building" as the guiding standard for the progress of our work. The most important of these is national defense and economic construction. National defense and economic construction are as important as military affairs during wartime, and are the primary elements for consolidating national security after the war. It is undeniable that our country lags behind in this area. In the future, we must catch up quickly and overtake others in order to ensure victory in the war and become a modern nation. The efforts of the past thirty years, especially the hard work of the past four years, have laid some foundations in this area, but they are still far from the ideal standard. In the future, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that our national defense and economic construction make rapid progress and develop significantly. Secondly, what we must shoulder is not only our own struggle and the work of nation-building, but we must also prepare to strive for the reconstruction of world peace. We are now in an era of great turmoil. All peace mechanisms have lost their effectiveness, and all hopes for peace have been shattered. The lives of people in all countries and the relations between countries have been seriously disrupted. This situation must end. We believe that the development of civilization and the happiness of mankind depend on the upholding of international justice and the preservation of international peace. To establish lasting and just peace among nations, the first step is to eliminate aggression, and the second step is to rebuild the new world order after aggression is eliminated. More than four years of resistance and nation-building have been our contribution to the first step of the work. As for the second step, we must prepare to actively participate at any time. China is a peace-loving and trustworthy nation, and the principle of the Great Unity is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal. Therefore, China will certainly be willing to cooperate with all countries as the most important member in promoting world peace in the future. This is not only what we ourselves firmly believe, but also what people of friendly nations commonly recognize. In short, we must work diligently and conscientiously, without any negligence or laziness, with a fiery spirit and an attitude of being on the battlefield, as if facing the enemy. Simply commemorating National Day in form has little significance. The most important thing is to uphold the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary martyrs in founding the Republic of China, and under the leadership of President Chiang Kai-shek, to fear no difficulties and sacrifices, to be of one heart and one mind, and to work hard. Only in this way can we be worthy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary martyrs, only in this way can we be worthy of all the soldiers who have died for their country and the compatriots who have died in the war since the beginning of the resistance, and only in this way can we be worthy of our Republic of China.

Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin Sent a Letter to Chairman Chiang to Express Congratulations

Chongqing—On the occasion of our thirtieth National Day, friendly nations have sent their congratulations. Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin sent a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on behalf of the Soviet government to express his congratulations. The original letter reads: "To His Excellency Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, On the occasion of the anniversary of your country's National Day, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Your Excellency, your government, and your people on behalf of my government, and I sincerely hope that the independent Republic of China, which the great Dr. Sun Yat-sen worked hard to create, will be further developed and prosper. The people of the Soviet Union and the people of China have always been extremely friendly, and firmly believe that these traditional friendly relations between them will be expanded and strengthened in the future. I wish the Republic of China prosperity and Your Excellency good health. Respectfully, Panyushkin, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Soviet Union to China, October 10, 1941."

The New York Times Retrospects the Events of the Wuchang Uprising

Washington—China's Double Tenth Festival, despite the grim news from the Soviet Union and the congressional debate on the Lend-Lease Act and the Neutrality Act, has not been ignored. The New York Times looked back at the Wuchang Uprising and briefly stated that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People could not be achieved solely through documents. China has been waging a bloody war against aggressors, which has now entered its fifth year. This aggressor has threatened the first principle of nationalism, rendering the other two principles of democracy and people's livelihood meaningless. China has not yet escaped foreign aggression or internal troubles, but it now stands before the world as a country that is battered and scarred, yet ultimately unconquerable and dedicated to safeguarding freedom. Freedom in China has become stronger, while it has been overthrown elsewhere in the world. Freedom in China is new and revolutionary, advancing with unwavering faith and the determination to die rather than surrender. China has persevered for four years without changing its course, and its future is hopeful. The Chinese people, who make up a quarter of humanity, are the latest and most powerful force of democracy, fighting with the conviction and sentiment to strive towards a new dawn. Madam Soong Ching-ling, the wife of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, issued a long article from Chongqing, which was revealed here on China's Independence Day. Analyzing China's struggle, she briefly stated that China's war is the implementation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism. Except for a very small number of Quislings, all Chinese people are patriots. Madam Soong Ching-ling also said that the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are not about goals, but about methods, which can be resolved through negotiations in a free and frank atmosphere of democratic spirit.

Overseas Chinese in Various Parts of the United Kingdom and the United States Celebrated the National Day

Washington—Overseas Chinese throughout the United States today warmly celebrated the 30th anniversary of National Day and reaffirmed their determination to support the National Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Overseas Chinese are also vying to donate comfort money to be remitted back to the motherland to comfort the national army that won victories in the battles of northern Hunan, western Hubei, and northern Guangdong. Overseas Chinese originally planned to hold a grand memorial meeting today, but due to the victories in Hunan and Guangdong, coupled with the news of the Chinese army's successful counterattack on Yichang, the event was changed to a grand celebration. People from all walks of life in the United States paid more attention to the Chinese today. President Roosevelt simultaneously received Mr. Belena, chairman of the United American Relief Committee for Chinese War Orphans, and Ambassador Hu Shi in the morning. Ambassador Hu personally presented the President with a scroll signed by 6,000 teachers and students from Christian universities across the motherland that have been aided by the United States. Roosevelt's meeting with Ambassador Hu and Mr. Belena on the National Day anniversary was a special expression of Sino-American friendship. The two spoke with President Roosevelt for 20 minutes. Mr. Belena raised the issue of the needs of Chinese refugees and discussed with the President and the Ambassador the possibility of providing assistance to them and restoring them to their original state. Afterwards, Mr. Belena told reporters, "I specifically informed the President that our campaign to raise US$5 million has already achieved more than US$2 million. Today, I received a donation of US$75,000 from New York. I will telegraph this good news to Madam Chiang." President Roosevelt was very satisfied with the generosity of the American people in donating and said that he hoped that the fundraising campaign would make the American people realize the importance of China's war of resistance against aggression to the Far East and the world. After receiving the scroll from Ambassador Hu, President Roosevelt immediately expressed his gratitude and said that he would store the scroll in the personal documents section of the Hyde Park Library. Ambassador Hu also gave two radio speeches on the Columbia Broadcasting System today, one explaining the historical significance of our revolution and the other explaining the major achievements of the past 30 years of the Republic. The Ambassador said that our country has become a modern nation with a strong and powerful government capable of defending national independence and freedom with heroic sacrifice, and that its belief in winning victory is growing day by day. Ambassador Hu also hosted a grand reception for overseas Chinese today. Overseas Chinese in Chinatown, New York, are scheduled to hold a lantern festival tonight. Similar celebrations are also being held in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago. (10th dispatch)

London—Overseas Chinese in London today enthusiastically held a celebration of the National Day anniversary at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom. Ambassador Gu delivered a speech at the meeting, saying that the 30th anniversary of the nation is the beginning of the establishment of a new China. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, China has become increasingly stronger. Japan, fearing the existence of a strong new China in the Far East, launched a war. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the unity and sacrifice of the people and soldiers of the whole country, China has been able to mount a strong resistance against Japan. After Gu's speech, Jin Wensi, Wang Jingchun, and representatives of the Kuomintang London branch and overseas Chinese representatives in London also stood up to speak one after another. Wang Jingchun advocated that donations be raised on the spot to relieve the suffering of compatriots in the motherland, and a total of £266 was raised. Also, the British Aid to China Committee today delivered £1,000 it had donated to our side, which was accepted by a young overseas Chinese representative.

### U.S. President Asked Congress to Amend the Neutrality Act to Allow Armed Merchant Ships to Sail to War Zones; New Lend-Lease Act Passed by the House of Representatives

Washington, Reuters, 10th—The full text of President Roosevelt's special message submitted to Congress is as follows: "The Neutrality Act may have seemed reasonable at one time, but like the Maginot Line, the war has now spread to all continents. Nations have become slaves, cities have become ruins, and hundreds of millions have been killed or injured. Never before have God's land and God's children suffered such harm. The form of Hitler's control of the world is now evident, and we are now more aware of the dangers we face. We have taken important and costly steps to assist the Allied countries, but we must strive to defend ourselves where defense is needed. In this regard, the government's actions cannot be hindered. The Neutrality Act now needs complete transformation. The amendments I have proposed do not incite war more than the Lend-Lease Act, nor do they reduce our neutrality further. The Neutrality Act once stipulated a ban on American ships sailing to belligerent zones, but Hitler believes that the world and the seven seas are all battlefields. I advocate the abolition of Article 6 of the Neutrality Act, which prohibits the arming of American merchant ships. Historically, internationally, and legally, the arming of American merchant ships is a reasonable act. We are now faced with a new type of pirate who sinks undefended ships without warning, so the arming of American ships is extremely urgent. Other aspects of the Neutrality Act must also be corrected. We should not allow ships to avoid Allied ports, allowing Hitler to dominate the seas. This is a real help to the aggressor. Today is the time for us to stop this kind of assistance. The payment of goods under the American flag is now more necessary than ever, and we can no longer rely on Norwegian and Dutch ships to do it. I am currently only asking Congress to act to implement congressional policy, so that what the Lend-Lease Act wants to do can be achieved, which is to deliver goods to those who can use them well. The military situation is now quite serious. Hitler is exerting all his efforts to destroy the Soviet Union and Great Britain. He knows that he is competing with time and is worried about American aid. We must act quickly, because the ultimate fate of the Western Hemisphere depends on this. Hitler has issued a challenge to Americans that we are unwilling and cannot tolerate. The American flag will never be driven off the sea by Hitler and disappear. We cannot allow the provisions of the Neutrality Act to cancel out the legitimate actions of the United States to defend its interests in the minds of those who have not yet realized the danger. We have decided on our course of action, and we will maintain the policy of freedom of the seas with all our strength and all our will." Government leaders in Congress acted immediately, advocating the repeal of the provision of the Neutrality Act that prohibits the arming of merchant ships. Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Bloom, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, have separately introduced similar bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.

Washington, Reuters, 11th—The House of Representatives passed the $5,985,000,000 Lend-Lease Act last night by an overwhelming majority of 328 votes to 67 votes. Congressman Lee Schiff had proposed an amendment stating that no money from this bill could be used to assist the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union is a country that practices communism. The Speaker replied that the United States certainly detests communism, but the Soviet Union is now resisting Hitler. At the same time, Democratic Congressman Fadey also said that whether we admit it or not, we should be grateful to the Soviet Union. The House of Representatives ultimately voted down Schiff's amendment stipulating that the Soviet Union should not enjoy Lend-Lease funds by a vote of 162 to 21.

### Ambassador Hu Shi Visited Roosevelt to Discuss Relief for China

### There Will Be No Peace Until Sovereignty Is Guaranteed; Guo Renyuan Gave a Speech in the United Kingdom

London, Reuters, 11th—Dr. Guo Renyuan said in a speech at the London Chinese Academy yesterday that the question that the Chinese people are most concerned about today is not whether China will negotiate peace with Japan, but when will the United States stop negotiating peace with Japan. China will never accept a compromise with Japan, just like Britain's attitude towards the Nazis. China's peace conditions include the restoration of all territories whose sovereignty belongs to China, including the Northeast, and the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Vietnam and the restoration of the independence of Korea. At the same time, Japan's war machine must be completely crushed, and China is prepared to actively arm itself. Dr. Guo, on a goodwill mission, recently arrived in London and will give speeches at universities and many other centers in London, Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow, and Birmingham.

### The Pro-Nazi Government Overthrown; The New President of Panama Took Office; This Coup Was Purely a Domestic Affair; U.S.-Panama Diplomatic Relations Were Not Affected

Panama City, Havas, 10th—A coup occurred in Panama yesterday, and the government led by President Arias was forced to resign, and Guardia took power. Cabinet ministers and the mayor of Panama City have been arrested. Afterwards, it was officially announced that President Arias had secretly left the country last night and arrived in Havana, Cuba. Although the official did not explain the reasons for the President's departure, political figures said that Arias's political enemies were putting increasing pressure on him. They accused him of opposing the United States and protecting socialism, fearing that the result of his implementation of nationalistic policies would endanger the relationship between Panama and the United States. It is reported that President Arias recently prohibited foreign merchant ships from flying the Panamanian flag from being armed.

Panama, United Press, 10th—After the government led by Arias was overthrown by a coup, Traslaguadia was sworn in as the new President of Panama yesterday. The second person nominated for President, Jayen Guardia, had already been sworn in at the Supreme Court, but resigned after only a few hours in office, giving way to Traslaguadia. After taking office, Mr. Traslaguadia did not reorganize the cabinet, but maintained the cabinet members who were in office when Jayen Guardia took office. He then issued a declaration explaining the reasons for the change of government, saying that former President Arias had been living abroad for a long time, which violated the constitution and laws of Panama.

Washington, Reuters, 11th—President Roosevelt told reporters last night that the United States' diplomatic relations with Panama will not change slightly due to the change of the President of Panama. He has discussed the change of President of Panama with the State Department and feels that this matter was done in accordance with the Panamanian constitution, so there is no question of recognition.

New York, Havas, 10th—The New York Times commented that the coup in Panama was purely a domestic affair and that the U.S. military fortunately did not intervene. However, President Arias's subordinates all have anti-democratic ideas.

### A Large Number of Germans Arrived in Japan from the United States

Tokyo, United Press, 11th—As the German army is advancing towards the central line of the Soviet Union, the Germans are apparently preparing to launch a diplomatic counter-offensive in the Far East at the same time to thwart the British and American attempts to get Japan to withdraw from the Tripartite Pact. At the same time, Japanese authorities and other senior government officials have accelerated preparations for the emergency, including air defense facilities and food storage. According to Japanese newspapers, this move will put Japan on a complete wartime footing to deal with any impending crisis. The Japanese ship "Hayama Maru" arrived in Yokohama yesterday from Mexico, carrying a large number of German personnel to work at the German Embassy and German communications agencies. They included many commercial experts, indicating that Germany is currently planning a new economic plan for Japan after the possible collapse of the Soviet Union and the removal of German obstacles. German economic expert Mr. Walder is still residing in Tokyo and is involved in this matter. Tokyo Japanese newspapers have recently expressed impatience with the U.S.-Japan talks, demanding that the government immediately clarify whether the Washington talks are hopeful of guaranteeing Japan's goal of achieving a new order in the Far East. At the same time, German Ambassador General Wöhler and Japanese Cabinet Planning Minister Dr. Ito held a lengthy meeting.

### Yarn and Flower: Sales in Hong Kong Stalled; Cotton Yarn Bulls' Formation Shaken; Jin Shuangma Suffers the Worst Drop

The yarn market, which was strong before the holiday, turned high yesterday and then entered a state of fatigue. This is because there is a lack of sales of spot yarn, and Hong Kong merchants have no purchasing movements, so the situation has become soft. However, the bulls believe that raw materials are difficult to loosen and cotton yarn itself is consolidated. The bears, in view of the blocked exports, cannot see prices rising, so the market is in a tug-of-war, rising and falling suddenly, making it difficult for operators to deal with. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 2,080 yuan, and the low price was 1,980 yuan. It is customary to have no market in the afternoon at the end of the week.

The Shuangma morning opening price was quite high due to the pull-up in the afternoon of the previous session, and the market price was very high, so the upward momentum continued to move forward. The first plate price was 2,050 yuan. At this time, the table surface was tight and sharp, reaching 2,080 yuan. Afterwards, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were not strong, and there were even fewer transactions with customers. People's hearts were lazy. At the same time, the prices of yarn and cloth on the exchange fell frequently, which led to the weakening of the bulls. The market went straight down, breaking the 2,000 yuan mark to 1,980 yuan. Then, due to the profit-taking of the earning people, it returned to 2,003 yuan at the close. It is estimated that the turnover statistics for half a day were 18,500 bales, all of which were speculative transactions among peers.

The Jin Shuangma futures market fluctuated sharply after rising and falling again. The minds of each gang have not been very persistent, especially the retail investors have no fixed opinions, so the market state is soft and many people rush to sell. However, the big bull investors are unmoved and still have a bullish trend. When the morning opened, the factory orders were delayed until 10 o'clock due to the certificate pursuit relationship, and the term yarn opened, first of all, taking advantage of the remaining power before the holiday, and stepped into the trend of soaring. The October opening was 1,890 yuan. After entering the second plate, it once rose to 1,935 yuan. The November opening was 1,960 yuan, and the December opening was 1,980 yuan. Then, because the spot opened and rose, it continued to rise again. However, the exchange continued to fall, and the downward trend became more and more intense. Although the major factory order bulls insisted on not moving, the general retail investors released term yarn one after another due to Saturday, and the sellers followed, and the drop was rapid and direct. The high and low differences reached more than 100 yuan. By the time of the closing, the scattered bears had made up for it again, and it recovered slightly. As a result, the noon closing price for October was 1,865 yuan, a drop of 20 yuan, the November price was 1,830 yuan, also down 62 yuan, and the December price was 1,880 yuan, also down 62 yuan. The list is as follows:

Opening 1,890.0 1,960.0 1,980.0

Highest 1,935.0 1,965.0 1,980.0

Lowest 1,860.0 1,810.0 1,860.0

Closing 1,865.0 1,830.0 1,880.0

Comparison Drop 20.0 Drop 62.0 Drop 62.0

### Cotton Market Slightly Hit

Although the current cotton situation is high, the yarn market is unsustainable. The raw materials that are closely related are also involved in the vortex. However, the holders still hold the doctrine of not selling at low prices.

Rangoon 100 pieces 520.0 Hao Jiajin

Also 100 pieces 522.0 Also

Also 100 pieces 515.0 Also

Omra 100 pieces 538.0 Also

Kandesh 100 pieces 532.0 Also

Rangoon 100 pieces 515.0 Also

The New York cotton market rose first because the textile industry bought forward and spot trade, and the situation was good, but then it fell slightly due to some profit-taking and cotton merchants selling short. As a result, yesterday's closing price was 16 to 17 pounds less than the increase on the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell due to the adverse effects of the war and the lack of interest from professionals. Yesterday's closing price fell by 12 rupees each. It is also predicted that today's opening market will rise by 0.75 rupees.

Today, 118 pieces of Indian cotton were loaded onto the Taikoo Company's Zhangjiakou wheel and transferred from Hong Kong to the port.

### Finance: Ten Taels of Gold Valued at 10,100 Yuan

The Haxia dark market, the spot futures reached its peak, and the surge continued unabated. Because foreign exchange is extremely tight, it is even more acute, and US dollars are difficult to settle even at four yuan. The minds of all parties are strangely firm. The spot price has broken the historical record of 10,000 yuan on August 23. In the buying trend of the Hong Kong gang and a certain bank and the Decheng and Shunyuan money houses, it stepped up from 9,980 yuan in the morning to an unprecedented high peak of 10,100 yuan. The Chaozhou gang entered and then exited, and Chengji's intention to sell was strong, which led to a drop of 80 yuan. Finally, because Xianghe re-entered, the upward trend was revived, and the closing price was raised by 110 yuan. About 900 taels were traded. Although the Hong Kong gang overturned the term gold, the bill merchants and securities firms continued to absorb it, rising directly from 7,910 yuan in the morning to 7,950 yuan at noon, a rise of 220 yuan. 1,7800 taels were transacted. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The price of jewelry gold also rose by 10 yuan to a high price of 1,030 yuan.

Spot Goods in Demand and No Supply

Xinfeng, Yongde, Fuyongsheng, and Dingsheng followed up and absorbed, and stepped up 30 yuan to reach 7,940 yuan. Hengji sold hard and returned down to 7,920 yuan. At noon, Chengda Jufeng Yong bought in and rose another 30 yuan. The closing price was 7,950 yuan, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous holiday (Thursday) late closing. The difference that day was 40 yuan.

Cash Up 110 Yuan

Haxia spot is still heading towards a high peak. From the first sight of Xianghe entering Zhongxing 20 taels in the morning, it was 9,980 yuan, which opened 30 yuan higher. Shihuodecheng entered and raised it to 10,050 yuan. Tongkang Yongxinfeng Yong each went out 350 taels, pressing it down to 10,010 yuan. Xinfeng Yong entered, Deda Shunyuan competed to enter even more urgently. The Tianjin gang sold, but it was difficult to frustrate the rise, and it stepped up 90 yuan. Shunyuan entered Zhongxing 10 taels, which was 10,100 yuan. Xianghe Chengji Dafeng competed to exit, and the market retreated to 10,020 yuan at noon. Finally, Xianghe re-entered, and Hengji also included it, and it was raised again. Finally, there were buyers at 10,060 yuan, an increase of 110 yuan compared to the previous holiday. There were high and low prices of 120 yuan that day, and 900 taels were traded. The selling price of the gold shop's local brand Yu was 10,100 yuan, and the purchase price was 100 yuan lower than the selling price.

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in the silver shop, Datongxing and Xinxing, was raised by 10 yuan at 10:30, totaling 1,030 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 50 yuan.

### USD 4 Yuan; Still More Demand Than Supply

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listings have not changed, and the HSBC small counter's British and American exchange rates are sluggish. The British and American exchange rates on the black market are extremely tight. The British exchange rate has shrunk to within two offices and a half, and the US exchange rate has been soft at the 4 yuan mark, both of which have appeared unprecedented tight prices. The imported foreign firms that are not allowed to apply for are forced to settle at expensive prices. Even the British exchange rate, which has been without a market for a long time, has a small amount of transactions. Importers picked up two offices, three seven five, and then there was a demand for two offices and two five but no supply. The US dollar telegraphic transfer was first supplied and sold by a certain Chinese merchant to the import foreign firm at a price of 4 yuan, and then the local transfer in the city was also 4 yuan, sold by the exporter to the Japanese merchant foreign firm. The market trend is extremely sharp, and the noon closing price, spot British gold two offices and two five, US dollar four yuan (all are trade account prices), compared with the previous day's Thursday late closing, the British tightened three seven five, and the US tightened one eight seven five. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

### Unprecedented US Dollar at 27 Yuan and 7 Jiao

There is also no shortage of needs for Japanese gold bills and Korean bills. The former is as high as 2 yuan and 4 jiao and 4 fen, and the latter rises to 2 yuan and 1 jiao.

### Securities: Huiyu Can Obtain High Profits; Sichuan Gang Sells Government Bonds Heavily

The open market for official detective work weakened again yesterday. Spot goods continued to flow out, and the Sichuan gang continued to sell. It is said that they are selling to make money and transferring remittances to Chongqing to make time deposits. They can obtain high interest and enjoy great profits from the remittance water subsidy. After remitting to Chongqing at the current market price, it is almost to the face value. Why wouldn't holders of government bonds be happy to do so? Therefore, the market is extremely abundant with chips, and many parties feel the pain of not being able to borrow out of stock. When the market price is occasionally pulled up, many parties take the opportunity to exit. Fortunately, the old bull has not seen any cracks at the moment. Yesterday was Saturday, and as usual, only one session was done in the morning. Jiufeng, Xinfu, Hefeng, Dazhong, and retail investors bought a lot of C-shares, which once rose to one and a half yuan, but Xie Xingyuan, Tongkang, Houde, and Baolong sold a lot, so it was as low as two corners. The closing was forced to be three corners. As a result, the market price fell more and rose less, and the turnover was about 1.2 million yuan. The concise table is listed below:

In stock trading, 200 shares of the Xinxin Company were traded, and the price per share was 47.5 yuan. At the moment, no kind of Chinese merchant stock is not advancing by leaps and bounds. There are quite a few people who entrust to buy, but there are very few sellers. The amount of shares is too small, which is very different from the number of foreign merchant stocks.

London 10th (Friday) telegram, today's hanging market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant company stocks is still flat and sluggish. HSBC's British registered shares alone fell by half a pound, to 80 pounds and 10 shillings. The Macaulay Bank shares also fell by 3 shillings and 9 offices, to 9 pounds and 10 shillings. The profitable bank rose two shillings and six pence, to twelve and a half pounds, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Food: Rice Market Is Volatile; Prices Always Rise More

Foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Zhangkou wheel arrived in port yesterday morning. In addition to a large batch of sugar shipped from Hong Kong, it also shipped 2,540 bags of foreign rice, which was berthed at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading (Zu).

Yesterday's foreign rice first rose and fell, and finally rose again. In the early market, due to the previous day's rising trend and the fact that customers hoarded and added purchases, and there were rumors of favorable conditions, the opening prices of each rice immediately increased by one or two yuan. Small twists once reached 125 yuan, and high-quality No. 1 Saigon goods reached 140 yuan. Then, because Dafu Lei Qia immediately loaded 3,200 tons at a price of 151 yuan, which has been confirmed to have been transacted, and when Xiaojiao was sold at a flat price of 110 yuan in the public warehouse, the actual consumption in the street stopped, so people's hearts returned to peace, and profits were released, and the market once fell by two or three yuan. Xiaojiao returned to a small 1223 yuan. However, at noon, major investors took the opportunity to absorb, and customers were even more aggressive in absorbing due to rumors. Xiaojiao shouted from 124 yuan and 25 yuan to 126 yuan and 7 yuan. Yinghua Si is currently 150 yuan and 149 yuan, and November is 151 and a half yuan to 151 yuan. 6-700 tons were traded, and there were more than 30,000 bags of spot rice.

Due to a sudden suspension of the market, the supply of thick and thin new and broken two japonica national rice has accumulated, which has made the sales in this hometown store quite strong, but the market is only flat, with no great honor or disgrace. It is estimated that early broken Nangan is 154 yuan to 151 yuan, old is 1446 yuan, Kunshan new japonica is 153 yuan to 149 yuan, Qing Yong kiln seed is 154 yuan to 151 yuan, and the supply and demand of new Du Jians are similar, and there is also a lack of Xuan and Chi, 130 yuan and 5 jiao to 129 yuan.

The source of glutinous rice has been interrupted for a long time, and the market goods are becoming scarce day by day, which has caused the market to become beautiful as soon as the retail appetite is strong. Moreover, foreign rice is also doing well, so the price has also been raised by one or two yuan. The opening price of Hong Kong Baiyuan was 200 bags at 148 yuan, followed by 144 yuan, and glutinous tea was 138 yuan.

### Firm Flour Market

With the dual support of active local buyers and speculators, the flour market initially showed strength. Since the market opened yesterday morning, demand from buyers and speculators did not weaken. Sellers were more determined to raise prices, and both American and Campbell flours saw increases of thirty to fifty cents. In the afternoon, some were transshipped to Tianjin from intermediary locations, and off-market speculation became even more active. Short covering and new buying were increasingly tense. In addition, flour stocks were depleted, making it difficult to fulfill orders even at a price of thirty-six yuan. Market sentiment was uniformly optimistic. Early trading at the fort area hovered around thirty-eight yuan, rising to thirty-nine yuan in the afternoon. At the close, speculators sold some back, bringing the price down to thirty-eight yuan and sixty cents. Golden Dragon Western Warehouse traded at thirty-six yuan to thirty-six yuan and thirty-five cents in the morning, rising to thirty-six yuan and seventy-five cents in the afternoon. Eastern Warehouse traded at thirty-six yuan and eighty cents in the morning, rising to thirty-seven yuan and twenty-five cents in the afternoon, closing at thirty-seven yuan and five cents, all nearly a yuan higher. Five hundred bags of bran were offered at a price of thirty-six yuan. Wheat was previously trading at fifty-five yuan, but sellers were unwilling to let go easily.

### Oil Market: Supply Adequate, Oil Merchants Rampantly Raising Prices, Corn Speculation Increasingly Rampant

The upward trend in edible oil prices continues unabated. Yesterday, vegetable oil prices were sharply raised by a significant ten yuan due to continuous hoarding by a major operator. Raw soybean oil also increased by two or three yuan. Qingdao raw oil has once again exceeded the limit. Despite an adequate supply, repeated price increases are perplexing. The total market sales included over two hundred barrels of Qingdao raw oil, three hundred barrels of Dalian soybean oil, fifty pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, thirty pieces of soybean oil, twenty pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, two hundred loads of Da You Factory clear oil, nearly one thousand loads of vegetable oil, three hundred barrels of Ri Hua Factory vegetable oil, and five hundred loads of coating and Yoshida Factory vegetable oil.

Corn speculation is increasingly rampant, and disruptive elements have gathered. Futures prices have been raised by another three or four yuan, with spot prices increasing by about one yuan. The total market transaction volume included over one thousand bags of Saigon and Dutch corn, and six thousand tons from the Yinghua Company.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Endlessly, Large Quantities of Granulated Sugar Continue to Arrive

Yesterday, the sugar market did not operate in the afternoon due to the weekend, but the trend was relentlessly upward. Spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar for the current month were marked at 182.1 to 183 yuan, slightly retreating to 182 yuan in the afternoon, a rise of 6.5 yuan. August imports were 176 to 178.5 yuan, then jumping to 182 yuan, falling to 181 yuan in the afternoon, a rise of 7 yuan. July arrivals were 178.5 to 180.5 yuan, falling to 177 yuan in the afternoon. Coarse white sugar was 164 to 166 yuan, 166.5 yuan, rising to 167 yuan in the afternoon. Dutch red sugar was 153.5 to 155.2 yuan, rising to 156.7 to 157.7 yuan in the afternoon, a rise of 5.7 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark was 188 yuan, a rise of 11 yuan. DY Mark was 170 yuan, HX Mark was 166 yuan, all rising 6 yuan. Company futures for coarse white sugar with a settlement date of October 20 opened at 177 yuan, closed at 181.4 yuan, with a high of 182.4 yuan and a low of 177 yuan, the same as the opening price. Off-market trading retreated slightly lower to 179 yuan, a rise of 5.1 yuan. Month-end futures opened at 180 yuan, closed at 182.8 yuan, with a high of 184.7 yuan and a low of 180 yuan, off-market at 181.2 yuan, a rise of 5.3 yuan. The transaction volume was over 80,000 bags for futures and over 11,000 bags for spot.

Large quantities of granulated sugar continue to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Zhangjiakou vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 7,400 bags of granulated sugar from Hong Kong, including 800 bags of Taikoo Car Sugar. A certain Dutch vessel that arrived on Double Ten Day also carried a large amount of granulated sugar. The exact quantity will be reported next week.

### North-South Goods: New Long Red Dates Appear

The first batch of new long red dates, amounting to several dozen pieces, has arrived. The quality of the goods is still good and have been offered at a price of fifty-six yuan, which is twenty yuan higher than the old goods. More are expected to arrive in the future, which may lead to a price easing.

### Seafood: Pepper Market Appears Peaceful

The pepper market has gradually turned peaceful recently due to infrequent transactions and weakened hoarding interest. Recent market prices are 320 yuan for white pepper, 105 yuan for No. 1 black pepper, and 195 yuan for large black pepper. The trend seems to have stabilized, and there is unlikely to be excessive fluctuation in the short term.

### Piece Goods: Customer Syndicates All Suspend Operations, Cotton Cloth Falling Sharply

Factory Cloth: The market was quiet yesterday because, although the customs authorities stated that specially approved goods could still be shipped to Southeast Asia, customer syndicates have submitted requests without results, causing people to wait and see. Transaction volume was greatly reduced, and selling pressure was slightly weak. Coarse and fine cloth twill fell by 25 to 30 cents, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by as much as 50 cents. Approximately two hundred pieces of cloth were transacted. Customer syndicates all suspended operations.

Eastern Cloth: Futures cloth on the exchange fell sharply due to selling by Japanese trading companies. Near and far month contracts fell by 2.1 to 3 yuan per piece. However, the spot market, although transactions were scarce, remained stable. Dragon Head fine cloth new orders fell by 1.8 yuan, closing at 64 yuan. Colored goods four-one gentleman new orders fell by 6 cents, closing at 2.34 yuan. Old orders and spot goods fell by only 1 or 2 cents, likely due to actual sales in the street.

### Import and Export: Large Commodities from Tianjin Mortgaged

Yesterday, the 11th, goods arriving in Shanghai included 540 bags of beans, 285 pieces of shredded tobacco, 260 bags of dates, and 190 bags of walnuts transported from Tianjin. In addition, 24 bags of yellow silk were transported from Yantai.

### Medicinal Materials: Platycodon Market Stable

Both arrivals and sales of platycodon are rare recently. Anhui-produced original packages are priced higher at over two hundred yuan, while ordinary ones are at one hundred seventy to eighty yuan. It is heard that there are arrivals in Nanjing, which may be transshipped to Shanghai soon.

### Chestnuts

— Gao Jiannong

The earliest geographical record of chestnut production in China should be the Classic of Mountains and Seas, traditionally attributed to Bo Yi of the Xia Dynasty. However, it only states, "Lun Mountain, Bronze Mountain, Ge Mountain, Jiaqi Mountain, their trees have many crabapples and pears." We cannot determine the precise locations of these vague mountain names. The first clear indication that chestnuts were produced in northern Hebei Province is found in the Strategies of the Warring States. It records the words of Su Qin, a strategist, persuading Marquis Wen of Yan in 334 BC, "Yan... has abundant jujubes and chestnuts in the north. Even if the people do not farm... they have enough food." Later books, such as the Historical Records' Biographies of the Money-Makers ("Yan and Qin have a thousand chestnut trees, their owners are equivalent to lords of a thousand households"), the Han Dynasty's Geography ("Shanggu to Liaodong... has... abundant jujubes and chestnuts"), Wang Yi's Ode to Lychees ("Giant chestnuts of Northern Yan and Northern Shores"), and the Tang Dynasty's Geography ("Youzhou tributes chestnuts"), and the Song Dynasty's Geography ("Guangxin Army tributes chestnuts"), all broadly refer to a large part of Hebei Province without pinpointing specific cities or counties. However, there is concrete evidence clearly recording which cities produce chestnuts. For example, Lu Ji of the Three Kingdoms, in his annotation of the Book of Songs' "Planting Hazelnuts and Chestnuts," states, "Chestnuts are found everywhere... but only the chestnuts of Yuyang and Fanyang are sweet, delicious, and long, surpassing those of other places." Zuo Si of the Jin Dynasty, in his Ode to the Capital of Wei, written over ten years, says, "Chestnuts of Gu'an." The Comprehensive Records of Territories, compiled by Prince Wei of the early Tang Dynasty, also states, "The chestnuts of Gu'an are known as Imperial Chestnuts." The various chestnut-producing areas mentioned above, such as Yuyang, Fanyang, and especially Gu'an, were famous as early as the Three Kingdoms, Jin, and Tang Dynasties, but who remembers them now? However, when mentioning "Liangxiang chestnuts," almost everyone, including women, children, villagers, and butchers, is familiar with the name! They are truly fortunate!

How did "Liangxiang chestnuts" gain this fame? It turns out that Fan Chengda, a poet of the Southern Song Dynasty, was appointed as a "National Prayer Envoy" by Emperor Xiaozong in 1170 AD. Along the way, he wrote poems on various topics. When he arrived at "Liangxiang" in Hebei, he used it as the subject of a seven-character quatrain, with a note below the title: "... a county belonging to Yanshan. The post station provides golden chestnuts, pears, and 'born-from-heaven' fruits, all precious fruits. There are also Yizhou chestnuts, which are very small and sweet." His poem is: "New cold freezes fingers like counting sticks, the village wine, though sour, is not unpleasant; purple rotten mountain pears and red wrinkled dates, all inferior to Yizhou chestnuts in sweetness!" Liangxiang's "golden chestnuts" gained fame and increased tenfold in value because of the poet's tasting and writing! This is the sole source of Liangxiang chestnuts' fame.

However, there are still doubts: does Liangxiang actually produce good chestnuts? Not to mention that the items provided by the post station may not have been from the local area, and not to mention that Fan Chengda's poem only mentions that Yizhou chestnuts are very sweet. Even the "golden chestnuts" provided by the Liangxiang post station are problematic! The above-mentioned statement, "...Liangxiang, a county belonging to Yanshan, the post station provides golden chestnuts," is based on the Records of Jifu compiled by Li Hongzhang in the tenth year of Tongzhi. But when I opened Fan Chengda's Collection of Stone Lake Hermit and found its original text—the book is from the Commercial Press's Four Series of Books—I was surprised that the two characters "golden chestnuts" had become "golden millet"! So, the post station did not provide two kinds of fruits, "golden chestnuts and pears...", but rather one kind of fruit, "golden millet pear," and the two characters "golden millet" are simply a pear name! There is a saying that a slight difference can lead to a great error. Here is another excellent example!

The two characters "golden chestnut" are very reasonable because the color of chestnuts is yellow, resembling gold, and there is a saying in ancient physiognomy books, "White as cut suet, yellow as steamed chestnuts." I hope that the "chestnut" character is a printing error and does not overturn previous evidence, doing something disappointing like burning the zither and cooking the crane! But when I opened the Liangxiang County Records, revised and published in the fifteenth year of Guangxu, and found its "Products" section, among the sixteen famous varieties listed in its "Fruit" category, there were peaches, apricots, plums, pears, etc., but simply no "chestnut"! This is truly a ghostly and perplexing matter! How should it be explained? Furthermore, Liangxiang, Gu'an, and Yizhou are all adjacent to each other. Gu'an and Yizhou produce chestnuts, so how could Liangxiang not produce any at all? I cannot break this mystery now. I will wait until I find concrete evidence before discussing it further.

### Celebrating the Double Ten Festival Enthusiastically, Foreigners Share Belief That China Will Win, Norwegians Praise Upholding Civilization, Western Newspapers Extol Heroic Struggle, Yesterday's Memorial of the National Father's Ordeal Passed Solemnly

The Continental Daily News reports that Norwegian broadcaster Mr. Poulson, on National Day, delivered a speech on the Great American Radio Station (call sign XBHA), stating that the Chinese people, relying on their steadfast and unyielding spirit, have been bravely fighting for freedom for four years. During this period, they have not received any substantial assistance from countries that should have actively cooperated with China earlier. However, this has changed in the past year, and now China can look forward to receiving substantial assistance from various democratic countries to engage in combat, and this assistance will continue to increase over time.

Struggling and Sacrificing, Victory Is Assured

Poulson continued, "Freedom and justice are not just empty words. If we are willing to succumb to oppression in any form, then individuals or entire nations will gradually degenerate and eventually perish. Civilization has been able to withstand various destructions so far because the principles that the people of China and the Allied countries are fighting to uphold, with civilization as the highest goal, have achieved this. Engaging in this struggle may require countless sacrifices, but in the end, the principles that are absolutely necessary for human survival will surely be victorious." Poulson also congratulated Mr. Aikoku on his return to Shanghai, extending congratulations to the free French people, saying that Mr. Aikoku, whenever issues involving common goals arise, disregards his own interests.

Belief in Victory, Now Confirmed

Western newspapers in Shanghai celebrated National Day, demonstrating the sympathy of friendly countries towards China. The main points are recorded below: (1) The North-China Daily News stated that although the Chinese people are celebrating National Day not in the best circumstances, everyone holds a hope that the time when China is completely independent will arrive, at which time it will be able to control the fate of the entire country. In the past thirty years, China has experienced hardships, the most significant being the four-year war with Japan. The outcome is still uncertain, but although the Japanese have occupied part of Chinese territory, they cannot destroy the Chinese government or maintain good order in the occupied areas. The Chinese people's resistance has won the praise of people all over the world. China's equipment is not good, but its spirit of resolute struggle is admirable. (2) The Continental Daily News stated that in past commemorations, the Chinese government has never expressed disappointment, but the hopes of the Chinese people have never been brighter than this year on this festive occasion. China's past hopes have now become a confirmed belief. The Double Ten Festival of 1941 is the beginning of China's victory. Although it is difficult to predict whether the war in China can end by this time next year, China's future will surely be greatly improved, enough to guarantee final victory. The reasons for this conclusion are obvious. China's war has plunged Japan into poverty. Japan's economy is very depleted, and its allies are far across the ocean and cannot be relied upon. Conversely, on the Chinese side, it has obtained active assistance from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

People from All Walks of Life, Working Hard at Their Posts

The day before yesterday was the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Just as victory reports were frequently received from the front lines and the international environment became increasingly favorable, people from all walks of life in the city, in a state of excitement, uniformly raised flags and took holidays to celebrate enthusiastically. The bright blue sky, white sun, and red earth national emblem fluttered throughout the city, all the more solemn and respectful. At the same time, the embassies and consulates of various friendly countries in Shanghai and the authorities of the concessions also stopped working and raised flags to express their congratulations on China's great National Day. People from all walks of life, remembering the hardship of the pioneers in creating the nation, and in order to maintain and promote the nation's foundation, were further inspired to be loyal, work hard at their posts, practice the late National Father's instructions, strive for the freedom and equality of the country, and actively promote the four major movements of thrift and saving, winter clothing donations, and gold donations for disaster relief, in order to fulfill the minimum responsibility of the people in the rear. The Shanghai Postal Administration, under orders, issued commemorative stamps with the words "30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China" and "October 10, 30th Year." They began issuing them the day before yesterday. These commemorative stamps were engraved and printed by the Shanghai Post Office Supply Department, so this port was the first to issue them on schedule yesterday. Starting today, various branch offices in this port will also issue them at the same time. However, each person is limited to purchasing a maximum of four sets.

Yesterday Was the Memorial of the National Father's Ordeal

Yesterday was the anniversary of the National Father's ordeal in London. Since the central government stipulated that it, along with the National Father's ordeal in Guangzhou on June 16, should be merged with the commemoration of the National Father's first uprising on September 9, people from all walks of life in the city, considering the special circumstances of Shanghai and following the central government's wartime revolutionary commemoration methods, did not hold ceremonies. However, to remember the difficulty of the National Father in creating the Republic of China and the greatness of his spirit and the difficulty of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, they decided to inherit the National Father's unfinished legacy, emulate the National Father's revolutionary spirit, and complete the great task of resisting and building the nation. They all made silent memorials and continued to solicit donations for the winter clothing movement. Since the concession authorities abolished the Mid-Autumn Festival alert in the old calendar, the day before yesterday, due to Double Ten National Day, and yesterday, being the anniversary of the National Father's ordeal in London, they maintained a continuous week of alert. Today, they began to revoke it and implement normal precautions.

### After the Ban on Yarn and Cloth Exports, Manufacturers Will Have Difficulty Maintaining Operations, National Cotton Is Also Monopolized and Raw Materials Are Difficult to Obtain, Foreign Shipping Has Been Deeply Affected

The Jianghai Customs, represented by Japanese Deputy Customs Commissioner Oyama, in the name of the Customs Commissioner, banned the export of cotton yarn and cotton fabrics. The announcement was not directly issued by Customs Commissioner Rofford. This is mainly for two reasons: (1) to prevent goods from flowing into the Allied countries and the United States, and (2) another retaliatory action against Roosevelt's freezing order.

Rumors of Lifting the Ban Are Absolutely Untrue

As for yarn prices, after the news that customs would implement a ban on exports was released on the 8th, prices plummeted. However, after the announcement was issued by customs on the 9th, prices rebounded, because there were rumors that the customs bureau would lift the ban on cotton yarn and cotton cloth exports. However, Japanese Deputy Customs Commissioner Oyama firmly denied this. According to Oyama, the issuance of this ban, unless special permission is obtained from the customs authorities, absolutely prohibits the re-export and transshipment of cotton goods. Yesterday, reporters asked import and export merchants why they did not request special permission for cotton yarn and cotton cloth exports. They replied that such good fortune can undoubtedly only be obtained by the Japanese.

Impact on Chinese Cotton Mills

The impact on Chinese cotton mills is very significant. It is inevitable that they will have to expand work-hour reductions. It is known that the inability of Chinese cotton mills to maintain operations is mainly due to the monopoly of national cotton, making it impossible to obtain raw materials, which is not related to foreign sales. It is claimed that the Japanese textile industry needs approximately 48,000 bales of cotton per month, which can be freely obtained within the scope of the planned economy for raw cotton, so there is no anxiety in operation. Conversely, Chinese textile industries cannot purchase foreign cotton, nor can they obtain Chinese cotton, so local consumption is limited to 10,000 bales per month.

British Ships' Cotton Cargo Forced to Unload

The English-language Great American Evening News reported that after the Jianghai Customs banned cotton exports, two British ships, the Guisheng of Jardine Matheson and the Suzhou of Butterfield & Swire, unloaded large amounts of cotton cargo yesterday (the 10th) in order to be allowed to export. Both of these ships were originally loaded with cotton cargo, preparing to export from Shanghai, but were ordered by customs to unload before being allowed to export, delaying their departure until yesterday. According to customs officials, this move by customs will have a significant impact on Chinese and foreign shipping industries, as cotton has long been a major cargo loaded from Shanghai by ships.

### Pork Almost Disappears in the French Concession, Pork Prices in the International Settlement Reach a Maximum of Six Yuan per Catty

The source of pork used in this city has always depended on the Jiangbei area, transported to Shanghai by pork merchants. Recently, due to Japanese military movements in Jiangbei, it has become difficult for various pork merchants to obtain transportation permits, resulting in a sharp reduction in the daily source from over a thousand pigs to just over a hundred. This has also been manipulated, leading to further increases in pork prices. In the French Concession, each butcher shop, because the authorities limit the maximum price of leg meat and spareribs to 3.44 yuan per catty, mostly does not dare to purchase because the purchase price is about 4.5 yuan per catty, and selling at the limited price would result in significant losses. Therefore, the butcher shops in the French Concession have generally stopped operating. The butcher shops in the International Settlement, because the prices limited by the authorities are flexible, are still operating as usual. The best leg meat even costs as much as six yuan per catty, and even at this high price, it is not easy to obtain.

### Shanghai-Nanjing Train Derailed by Bombing Between Suzhou and Kunshan

The English-language Great American Evening News reported that yesterday (the 10th) at 10:30 PM, a train on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, while traveling between Suzhou and Kunshan, suddenly encountered an explosion, causing the engine and three cars to derail. News from the Japanese this morning (the 11th) stated that the engine and train cars were severely damaged, but there were no casualties. It is heard that the derailed train was a freight train, and the explosive was a large bomb. After the incident, the Japanese immediately dispatched a team to investigate, but the bomber was nowhere to be found. The damaged rails were already being repaired last night, and traffic will be restored this morning, but normal operations are expected to resume only in the afternoon of the 11th.

### Annual Inspection of US Troops Stationed in Shanghai

Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Navy's Yangtze River Patrol Fleet, inspected the headquarters of the Fourth Regiment of the US Marine Corps and the Motor Transport Squadron stationed in Shanghai today (the 11th). Other US military units are expected to be inspected next week. Rear Admiral Glassford must inspect the US military once a year as a matter of routine.

### US Dollar Exchange Approved, Rice from Public Granaries Released

The Food Rice Public Granary Management Committee has determined the first batch of more than 58,000 bags of rice from public granaries. About 1,000 rice shops have been contracted to sell the rice. It is learned that various rice shops in the British and French concessions have completed the procedures and have shipped out the goods. The rice sales started at 9:00 a.m. yesterday at the fixed price of 110 National Currency per dan (net weight of 160 market catties). The purchase limit per household is not more than one dan, in order to be widespread, but must comply with the regulations and not cause disturbances. In the past, the Shanghai Municipal Council directly purchased Yangon small-grain rice from the Hong Kong government and sold it in Shanghai at a fixed price. After the sale of this foreign rice in Shanghai at a fixed price, the speculative rice merchants were dealt a blow, and the rice market gradually stabilized. It is heard that over 150,000 tons (i.e., 1.5 million bags) of this foreign rice have been shipped to Shanghai, and there is no risk of interruption in the future. The Price Stabilization Fund Committee, considering that the selling price of rice in Shanghai needs to be further suppressed, has approved the supply of legitimate foreign exchange for the Municipal Council's purchase of foreign rice.

### Winning Numbers of the National Bonds

The twelfth redemption drawing of the Class C bond certificates of the 25th year of the Republic was held yesterday at 10:00 am, attended by representatives from the National Debt Fund Management Committee, the First Special District Local Court, the Banking Association, the Money Trade Association, and the Central, China, and Communications Banks, including Wang Boyuan, Pei Yunqing, and Yan Dayou, and more than twenty others. Chairman Pei Yunqing reported that this drawing involved eighteen bonds, each worth 350,000 yuan, for a total redemption of 6,300,000 yuan. The principal and accrued interest of the drawn bonds will be paid from January 31st of the 31st year, following the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, and will be disbursed by the Central Bank in various locations and the China and Communications Banks entrusted by it. The winning numbers are listed below: No. 072, No. 200, No. 175, No. 242, No. 272, No. 340, No. 453, No. 451, No. 514, No. 523, No. 678, No. 623, No. 750, No. 784, No. 900, No. 833, No. 924, No. 995.

### Price Stabilization Work to Be Completed by the End of the Month

The government authorities, recognizing that prices in various regions are being repeatedly raised by speculative merchants, which not only disrupts local order and the people's livelihood but also affects the future of the war, are deeply concerned about the soaring prices and the daily lives of the people. They previously ordered the Economic Council of the Executive Yuan to formulate a "Four-Month Plan for Price Stabilization," which is divided into four parts: materials, wages, transportation, and finance. The relevant responsible agencies in various regions are cooperating to gradually complete the plan before the end of October this year. Since its implementation, the plan has been remarkably effective and is now largely completed. It is expected that the entire  matter will be completed before the end of this month, and the supply and prices of goods in various regions will soon gradually become balanced.

### Cake and Steamed Bread Industry Continues to Request Supply of Subsidized Flour

Since its establishment with the approval of the Shanghai Municipal Council last spring, the Cake and Steamed Bread Industry Association of this city has successively distributed subsidized flour, provided medical consultations, and offered relief to the poor and sick, benefiting the industry. Since the suspension of subsidized flour supply on July 2nd of this year, the flour market has been endlessly rising, now exceeding 37 yuan per unit. At the same time, the prices of meat and oil have soared, while the selling prices in the market have not been able to increase rapidly. Therefore, it is planned to re-submit a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council to continue regulating the people's food supply, suppressing prices, and stabilizing the flour market.

### Cotton Exchange Settlement for This Month Is Still Under Careful Consideration

According to news from foreign banking circles, the Sino-British-American economic conference currently being held in Hong Kong has decided to continue supplying rice, coal, petroleum, gasoline, and tobacco for Shanghai's October foreign exchange allocation at the same amounts as in September. However, cotton is still under careful consideration. It is reported that the attendees of this conference include N. Meya, Hulbert, and Rogers from the British side, Kirkland and Fox from the American side, and Chen Guangfu, Bei Songsun, and Xi Demao from the Chinese side. The requests from the film industry, insurance industry, and cotton industry representatives sent from Shanghai to Hong Kong to negotiate foreign exchange have yielded no results.

### Two Cargo Ships Transporting Coal to Shanghai, Over 8,000 Tons

The Jardine Matheson cargo ship S.S. Norse Carrier, after a delay due to a hurricane, imported and arrived in Shanghai on Thursday afternoon, carrying 4,200 tons of coal from Balikpapan. In addition, the Thai merchant ship Thepstri Nawa, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th, has also been postponed and will arrive this morning (the 12th). This ship carries 4,268 tons of coal, which will all be unloaded in Shanghai.

### Rong Wu Society Holds Sutra Lecture

The 25th sutra lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Lecture Society will be held on the 12th, at three o'clock old time and four o'clock new time, still on the fourth floor of the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road. Listeners should arrive on time.

### Japanese Small Steamer Overloaded with Passengers Causes Major Tragedy Upon Departure; Fifth Tairi Maru Heading to Chongming Baozhen Capsizes in Waves, Fifteen Dead

The Japanese small steamer Fifth Tairi Maru, operating between Shanghai and Chongming Baozhen, specializing in carrying passengers and not loading cargo, making daily round trips, on the morning of the 9th of this month, fully loaded with passengers at the Bund wharf on Wuma Road, set sail for Baozhen.

Small Vessel Size

On that day, there were slight winds and waves offshore, and the vessel's size was small. After exiting the Wusongkou, the ship showed signs of being unable to withstand the conditions, and immediately turned back. After a while, it set sail again, but the ship still could not cope, so it retreated into the Songkou a second time. In the afternoon, it made a third attempt to depart, but after sailing about two or three miles,

Encountered Head-on Waves

Suddenly, a head-on wave struck, causing the entire ship to be submerged by seawater. The passengers panicked, and the order was disrupted, causing the ship to capsize, and some passengers fell into the water. The ship immediately stopped to rescue them. At that time, the Japanese steamer Eighteenth Taigu Maru, also departing for a port north of the Yangtze River, saw the small steamer in distress and approached to help with the rescue.

Exceeded Capacity

It is reported that more than thirty people were rescued at the time, fifteen died, and more than ten are missing. The ship was overloaded with passengers, carrying more than 300 people in total. According to regulations, it should not exceed 150 people. Now it has exceeded the limit by more than double. Even without wind and waves, it would be unable to sail. According to the shipping industry, according to the former Navigation Administration Bureau regulations, this small steamer should not be allowed to carry passengers and sail on the sea. However, it is heard that the ship is currently under repair, and after the repairs are completed, it will continue to operate.

### Nanshi Iron Gates Reopened

The iron gates of the French Concession bordering Nanshi, which were closed at 4:45 pm on the 9th due to a Japanese soldier being ambushed in Nanshi, were not opened all day on the Double Tenth Festival due to security concerns. This resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of residents being stranded in the French Concession of Nanshi. It is now learned that the Japanese in Nanshi have completed their search within the area and have notified the French police, who then reopened the iron gates yesterday morning.

### Rumor of Rachel Hardoon's Will, to Be Announced in British Court

It is learned that the estate dispute of the Jewish tycoon Hardoon has intensified since the death of Hardoon's wife, Rachel Hardoon. As a result, the cause of Rachel Hardoon's death has been the subject of various speculations and has become an event closely watched by international figures. It is rumored that Rachel Hardoon, before her death, entrusted a lawyer to draft a will, expressing her wishes regarding the disposal of her estate. It is also heard that the will will be publicly announced in the British Consular Court next week. Currently, there are nine adopted sons, nine adopted daughters, and other relatives and adopted brothers who are involved in the distribution of the estate. Therefore, the contents of the will are a matter of great interest.

### French Concession Detective Shen Jinshu Ambushed, Shot in the Back While Stepping onto a Tram, Bullet Entering Abdomen from Buttocks, Seriously Wounded

Shen Jinshu, alias 99, a detective and acting inspector in the Criminal Section of the French Concession Police, a native of Yancheng, 39 years old, with his wife, Mrs. Zhu (a local resident, 33 years old), and his young son (5 years old), resided at No. 3, Hezongfang (west end of Caishi Road), Lane 184, 184 Route Lafayette. Yesterday morning at 8:45, after breakfast, Shen intended to go to the police station to work, wearing a dark brown jacket and gray flannel trousers. He originally intended to take a chartered car, but the driver Ah San was washing the car at the door, so Shen decided to walk to the tram stop at the Wugui tram stop of Lafayette Road Caishi Road No. 81. When a 17 road tram from north to south drove, Shen pulled the railing and attempted to leap on it, but at that moment, a man in a blue cloth gown, about 30 years old and with a thin face, pulled out a gun and fired at Shen. Shen was caught off guard and hit in the right leg. But Shen did not realize it and thought he heard gunfire from somewhere. Soon after, a second bullet came and hit Shen's buttocks. Because Shen was still standing on the tram's footboard, the bullet went into Shen's abdomen after hitting his buttocks. Seriously injured, he immediately fell off and fell to the blood on the tram platform. The shooter, seeing that the goal had been achieved, fled with the gun and disappeared. Soon after, the police received the news and quickly dispatched a large team of Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene, implement temporary security, and call a car to send Shen to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is heard that Shen's injury is extremely serious, but his mind is very clear. As of press time, the bullet in his abdomen has not yet been removed. According to reports, Shen has served in the French Concession Police for more than 20 years. He was promoted from police officer to Chinese detective and gradually promoted to his current position. The police are investigating the cause of the attack.

### Tettamanti Committed Two Crimes, Sentenced to a Total of Five Years; Appears Calm, Seemingly Unconcerned About the Sentence

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, Tettamanti, the former Deputy Executive Officer of the US Narcotics Bureau in China, was found guilty of two crimes: stealing and selling public guns and concealing the truth. Special Commissioner Lu of the Narcotics Bureau determined that the charges were true. A few days ago, he was sentenced to two years in prison for stealing and selling public guns. The sentence for concealing the truth was announced in court today (the 11th). He will serve a total of five years in prison, including the previous two years, at McNeil Island Penitentiary in the United States or another prison designated by the US Attorney General. Today, Tettamanti was escorted to court by a police officer from the Public Concession. He still smiled and greeted reporters from various newspapers, seemingly unconcerned about being sentenced to prison. When he heard the commissioner's verdict, his face only turned slightly red. When leaving the court, he thanked his lawyer, Captain Wertin Teink, and appeared calm.

### Engaging in Refugee Production and Construction, Puyi Handicraft Cooperative Appeals to All Sectors for Donations

Shipping Inconvenience, US Relief Rice Interrupted, Recurring Expenses Are in a State of Panic; a Goal of 50,000 Urgently Awaits Support from All Parties

The Puyi Handicraft Cooperative is a refugee relief organization modeled after the American handicraft relief method. Its work is practical, and its achievements over the years have been remarkable. After an interview with this newspaper, it has twice introduced the mission and work of the cooperative. Now, due to the inconvenience of Sino-American shipping, the US Red Cross relief rice, which the cooperative relied on to provide meals for refugee workers, has been interrupted and is unlikely to be restored soon. Moreover, after the foreign exchange freeze, the economic assistance from the American Church has also stopped, causing the wages of refugee workers and recurring expenses to fall into a state of extreme panic. As a last resort, it is appealing to all sectors for donations, hoping that enthusiastic people will actively contribute so that the cooperative's active relief work will not be abandoned halfway.

Relief Work

The cooperative is run by the Christian Puyi Society, which specializes in social services in Nanshi before the war. The main tasks are (1) refugee workshops, recruiting refugees to work inside, providing food and wages, (2) free schools, solving the education problems of refugee workers' children, and rescuing street children, giving them the opportunity to go to school, (3) refugee shops, selling low-priced daily necessities, (4) refugee farms, using empty church fields to grow vegetables, providing for the refugee workers' canteens, (5) free clinics, providing free medicine and treatment for refugee workers and nearby poor people, as well as day care centers, refugee children's bathrooms, vocational training, etc., all of which are active relief work, with the principle of cultivating refugees' self-help and self-sufficiency.

Solicitation of Funds and Materials

The cooperative has always used waste production as a feature of the refugee workshops. The waste is solicited from the outside, and whatever is needed, whether it is broken clothes or old items. The cooperative has a Puyi bag, and readers can call 1608 to request it from the cooperative office, and put everyday useless, old, and discarded clothes in the bag, and notify the cooperative, which will immediately send someone to collect it. The current fund-raising goal of the association is 50,000 yuan, and it also hopes that readers will respond enthusiastically, no matter how much or how little, and actively donate. Donation collection locations: (1) the cooperative office, 2nd Floor, 115 Hankou Road, (2) Shanghai Bank Tongfu Road Branch, (3) Shanghai Bank Yuyuan Road Branch, (4) Shanghai Bank Xiahfei Road Branch.

### Children and National Day

— Huang Jingwan

A country is formed by the combination of many people. There are people first, then a country. China is formed by the combined Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups. Today's children are the future masters of China and the mainstay of the new society. The progress of society in the future will be the responsibility of today's children. If our children are very good, the country in the future will also be very good; if we are not good when we are young, the country in the future will be very bad. Like Yue Fei in ancient times, he loved martial arts when he was young, and when he grew up, he drove back the Jin people. There is also Sun Yat-sen in modern times. He loved nature and liked to read when he was young. Seeing the corruption of the Manchu Qing, he rose up in revolution, overthrew the Manchu Qing, and created a great new China. Please see the unity and struggle of China in the past five years, which has become stronger and stronger. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Russia, and other countries have shifted their attention, improved their relations with China, and corrected their previous ignorance and mistakes, and will automatically return the leased places. This time, we are celebrating the 30th National Day anniversary. Children across the country suffering in hardship should recall the difficulties of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country to create the Republic of China. I was a member who participated in the revolutionary work in the Xinhai Year. I served in the Shuye Chamber of Commerce and attacked the Manufacturing Bureau. After the restoration of Shanghai, I participated in the Shanghai Army Northern Expedition Vanguard Student Army led by Governor Chen Qimei. After fighting in Dengzhou and Huangxian, after the restoration of eastern Shandong, I was dispatched to serve in the Presidential Palace Gendarmerie Battalion of the Ministry of the Army led by General Huang Keqiang in Nanjing. When the north and south were reconciled, I retired from the army and hid in the city, engaged in social undertakings, and devoted myself to children's welfare issues, establishing children's libraries, travel groups, playgrounds, parks, opera houses, health associations, labor nurseries, and schools for refugee children. I hope that children will study hard, read newspapers, pay attention to current affairs, set goals to become self-reliant, and become great in the future, and become useful citizens to serve the country and save the world.

### The Story of Taro

— Huai Liang

Dear children, hasn't your mother been cooking taro for you these past few days? But do you know how the taro came about? Now I'll tell you the story!

When Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Liu Xiu, went to fight Wang Mang, he was once surrounded by Wang Mang's soldiers on a small mountain. For several days, he couldn't get down, and the dry rations he brought were all eaten up. It looked like each of the soldiers was about to starve to death, and the enemy soldiers under the mountain surrounded them for several days but couldn't attack. So they set fire to the hillside, thinking that this would definitely burn Liu Xiu's soldiers to death. Who knew that it wouldn't be so, but instead, this fire burned them alive. After the fire went out, they found a special fragrance in the ashes, and a series of whiffs pierced their nostrils. When they dug it open, they found that it was taro that had been cooked by the fire. At that time, they realized that there were many of these foods hidden in the mountains, so they dug as much as possible, and everyone ate their fill, their spirits recovered, and they killed their way down the mountain, broke through the encirclement, and turned defeat into victory. That day happened to be August 15th, so later when Liu Xiu became emperor, he always ate two taros on that day every year as a memorial.

### Solution to "An Arithmetic Game"

— Wang Yanxiang

Children, did you read the article "An Arithmetic Game" by Mr. Xin Fang in last week's issue? I guess you all read it! I'm afraid you've all tried it? Adding, subtracting, multiplying, what was the result? Your house number and age are not even slightly off, and they are all in the answer! This strange and interesting game, maybe you have shown it to your friends who didn't know it, and they were very surprised by your cleverness? Maybe they even asked: "Hey! Can you teach me this method?… But how can you think of it?" You taught him this method, but can you tell him its source? If not, I will tell you below

The original method is as follows: first double the house number of someone's residence, then add five, then multiply by fifty, then add someone's age, then add three hundred and sixty-five, then subtract six hundred and fifteen. In this way, the last two digits of the answer must be someone's age, and the other digits are the house number of someone's residence in order. Someone's age cannot exceed two digits, and there is no limit to the house number.

Doubling the house number means multiplying the house number by two. Multiplying the multiplied number by fifty after adding five means multiplying the multiplied number by fifty (i.e., multiplying the house number by one hundred) plus five times fifty (i.e., two hundred and fifty); adding three hundred and sixty-five and then subtracting six hundred and fifteen is equal to subtracting two hundred and fifty. I can use an example to illustrate this. For example, if you initially lent someone three hundred and sixty-five yuan, but later borrowed six hundred and fifteen yuan from them, the result is that you owe them two hundred and fifty yuan, which is the same principle. Adding two hundred and fifty before, and subtracting two hundred and fifty now, is equivalent to not adding or subtracting, all disappearing. Now all that remains is one hundred times the house number plus his age. (Stop reading here and think about the source of this method. If you can't think of it, read on.) Multiplying a number by one hundred means adding two zeros after the number. Here, the house number cannot have decimals or fractions, it can only be an integer. The last two digits of the answer, adding the age (which cannot exceed two digits), is of course the age. The previous digits are the house number, which is also obvious, as I said before.

Children! The cause and effect of this arithmetic game are now clear! Now, you can be considered to have thoroughly understood it. We should have a scientific spirit in everything we do, and when we understand a problem, we should not only observe the phenomenon but also delve into its essence. This point has a really close relationship with the future of children!

### Words During Moon Viewing

— Lin Ren

Last Sunday evening, there were some wisps of clouds in the sky, but as soon as the round bright moon peeked out from the trees, the clouds seemed to have vanished. A-Liang and his father sat on the balcony, watching the moon gradually rise. Its pure white light shone on his face, making him feel strangely comfortable, unlike the hot sun during the day. He was puzzled. His father had just said that the moon's light wasn't its own, but sunlight reflected off the moon onto Earth, like a mirror that couldn't emit light itself but could reflect external light. If sunlight is hot, why does the moon reflect it as a cool light? This question circled in his mind, and he couldn't find an answer. So, he turned to his father.

"A-Liang, that's a good question. You see, the moon is a 'bad' thing. When the sun shines light and heat on it, it absorbs the heat fully and rejects the light. So, it 'steals' the heat and releases the light. You must know that this sun light without heat becomes the moon's light, which is cool and completely different from sunlight. Therefore, we don't feel any need for moonlight, but we cannot live without sunlight. If there were no sunlight, we wouldn't have day and night; we'd live in darkness all the time, and no one wants that!"

"Dad, I heard people say that if you see the 'yuehua' (moon halo) tonight, you'll get rich. Is that true? Dad, what's 'yuehua'? I don't really understand."

"How could there be such an easy thing in the world? If there were, everyone would stay up all night tonight, craning their necks and opening their eyes wide, hoping to see the 'yuehua' and get rich. That's just baseless nonsense; don't believe it. Everything in the world requires effort to get results. No effort, no results. There's no such thing as getting something for nothing. The 'yuehua' has been talked about since ancient times. Some friends say it's the essence of heaven and earth, which is just inexplicable nonsense. You already know that the moon reflects light, and there are many ice-like stones around it. These stones also reflect light, creating a halo around the moon, which we call 'yuehua'. So, you see, 'yuehua' is a very common phenomenon in the sky. What does it have to do with getting rich? It's a joke!"

"Dad, why can we only see the 'yuehua' at night and not during the day?"

"That's just because you don't pay enough attention. Sometimes you can see it during the day, as long as the moon is high above the horizon and there are no clouds or fog blocking it. We can see the moon then, but it's not as full as on Mid-Autumn Night. We only see half or a small sliver. But it's never as bright as at night, because the moon's light is very faint compared to the intense sunlight. So, it looks blurry and not very clear." At that moment, a cool breeze blew, and they both felt a chill. Also, it was getting late, and A-Liang had to go to school tomorrow. So, they left the balcony and went to sleep.

### Narrative on the Double Ten Festival

— Zhuang Fu

Celebrating the National Day, sharing the joy of Qingming, the fellow enthusiasts made an agreement for a musical gathering. Twenty people attended, singing eighteen excerpts. The room was filled with unique flowers, their beauty dazzling, and the new sound of sandalwood clappers still lingered in the ears. Shu Sheng unloaded the vigor of the seal, Jing Shen picked up the emotion of the painting, and the city banquet was magnificent; Yi Nan's subjugation of the tiger was steady and full of energy, Heng Yi's Niang was clear and rich in flavor, Yang Zhen's plunge into the abyss was high in pitch and round in voice; Yun Shu and Shu Ying's cut and sell, Tong Sun and Xin Zhai's male sacrifice, were all old hands, naturally brilliant, and in several families, their seats could not be taken away. As for me, the carefree emperor, one song of Ling Ling, I knew not whether it was sound or tears. After stopping the red teeth, the feast remained in high spirits, after the wine, Jing Shen sang two branches of Qiao vinegar, and Qian Yao and Wen Jiubu played the flute, the lyrics rolled off his tongue, the sound escaped half the sky. Song can relieve boredom, wine can sweep away sorrow, exhausting the excitement of a day, writing it in ink, still feeling ashamed! There were also those who said that this way is indeed declining, and now the fellows have hired three photographers, gathered at No. 18, Lane 489, Dagu Road, arranging daily photography lessons, willing to share with all the sons who love Kunqu opera; those who are ambitious are welcome to join, no restrictions. Although Guqu is a small way, the depth of its feelings can be imagined, we must know that the Central Plains of the past did not perish in the Yuan, not allowing it to be its merit.

### During the National Day Season, Two Elder Performers Simultaneously Appear on Stage (Bottom)

— Guo Yi

I am temporarily unwilling to make a detailed comparison and analysis of Bao Sen and Fu Ying's artistry, but to speak in general terms, Fu Ying's sharpness is outwardly revealed, while Bao Sen's essence is inwardly contained; therefore, Fu Ying has a heroic air and is good at leaning on the bar, and the battle of Taiping Dingjun Mountain is his winning drama, Bao Sen's pattern is graceful and dignified, and his pleated robe play has a detached and refined charm, and going to Zhuge Wuhou is just the right identity, especially seeing the atmosphere, so the loss of Jie Ting is a drama, and later generations have never surpassed it. (Bao Sen is quite determined to perform more dramas of Wuhou, intending to gather the deeds of Wuhou from Tianshui Pass to Qixingdeng, and arrange and sing them continuously, and once asked me to compile the scenes for him, so that the beginning and the end are connected in one breath, although I am eager to do it, but counting his next visit to Shanghai, the old dramas in these six Qishan campaigns will be able to meet with the people of Shanghai one by one.) As for one person's skill, although there are still different points of purity and mixedness, I will not say anything. But Bao Sen's misfortune has also been many years. However, he steadfastly abides by the rules and regulations, and never creates novelty to cater to vulgar tastes. In today's north-south trend of soft and charming singing, he is able to live in the atmosphere and not be swayed by the last, he has the ambition to defend himself, and his ambition is commendable. Now, once he stretches his head and eases his eyebrows to compete with Fu Ying, no matter who wins or loses, I will always feel happy for him.

### After Watching "Moonlight Sonata"

— Sha Fei

"Moonlight Sonata" is a masterpiece by Xu Xu. A theater group performed it before, but the director's technique was not light enough, and the actors' acting skills were too poor, so the results were not very good. This time, the "Moon" drama club, organized by students from Guanghua, Zhijiang, Datong and other schools, performed it at the Lyceum Theater. The actors are all students. Although they are not yet proficient in stage experience, the expression of young people's spirit is worthy of our sympathy and encouragement.

This script is aimed at reality. It describes the adventurers of the twentieth century, who are using their "speculation" skills and "manipulation" stunts to cut meat and draw blood from many people. However, when the doomsday comes, the adventurers' ability and shrewdness are exchanged for pain and sorrow. In the play, the playwright fully uses his intelligence, portraying a family problem into a social dynamic, and representing light and darkness with the different personalities of one or two people.

The whole play has five acts. From the opening to the end, it consistently breeds a bitter taste, although there are also some funny and lively scenes in the middle. I feel that it is like a beautiful and illusory poem, with interesting drama, but it is constantly grabbing the audience's heart.

In terms of actors, Ye Qi's Zhang Mu is the most successful. Secondly, Zi Di's Yue Liang has a true feeling, Fang Zhou's Li Xunwei has a stable stage presence, Lu Lu's Li Wentian has put in a lot of effort, Zhu Zi's Zhang Yuan'er has a lot of talent, Bao Hua's Li Wendao has a fluent tone, and the others can also do a good job of being not sloppy or careless.

The set design, effects, lighting, makeup, and prompting are all perfect.

We wholeheartedly express our best wishes to the Moonlight Drama Club, hoping that the second performance will be more courageous, more diligent, and more progressive!

### Shenbao Entertainment World "Fun Test"

I remember on August 24th of last year, this publication held a "fun test".

The questions are very simple. You must be able to guess them. You might as well come and try it.

(1) In the past three years, among the domestic and foreign films shown in Shanghai, which one had the longest initial screening period? Which theater was it shown in? How many days did it run?

(Correction Statement) In the list of thirty-two people in the second question of the "Fun Test" published on the Double Ten Festival, the name "Lan Lan" was omitted. Yesterday, we received letters and telegrams from readers from all over the world, which shows that everyone is very interested, which makes me feel ashamed. Therefore, the original question is reprinted as above. However, after checking the thousands of application letters received yesterday, most of them have already added the name of Lan Lan to the table, which shows that everyone has a clear idea. In addition, even those who leave it blank and do not fill in the name will be considered qualified. Please rest assured about this. (Editor)

(Note) Only cut and paste the answer form. Do not attach other questions and prize-winning methods. The filling must be done with ink or a pen. Pencil or blurred answers will be invalid.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 17: A Crown-Rattling Rage for a Beauty

A proclamation was issued and sent to the various prefectures of Hebei, urging officials in various places to rise up and form a righteous army to defend the emperor, denounce the rebellious bandits, and avenge the late emperor. Therefore, Wu Meicun, a poet in the early Qing Dynasty, wrote the poem "Weeping bitterly for the six armies in white mourning clothes, a crown-rattling rage for a beauty," which can be said to be realistic and profound. Zhang Cangqiu heard that Wu Sangui had ordered the bandits to be attacked and mourning clothes were sent out, and he was very happy, so he and Chen Fei ran to Xu Jing and Liu Yinying again and said to the two: "You suspect that General Wu is unwilling to attack the bandits and has the heart to rebel, but now General Wu has given the order, do you still doubt it? Our brothers can take this opportunity to sharpen our swords and fight a bloody battle with the bandits on the battlefield. If we can recover the imperial capital, capture and kill the chieftains, restore the Ming Dynasty, and sweep away the dark clouds, wouldn't that be a great thing?" Xu Jing also said happily: "I just heard this news, and the stuffiness in my chest was relieved. There will probably be a bloody battle soon. Brother Zhang, prepare your good skills and kill the bandits for the country." Liu Yinying was still unable to dispel his doubts about Wu Sangui's attack on the bandits, but he also believed that Wu Sangui's conscience was still there and he could not bear to betray the country, and he finally had this happy move. So everyone happily put on white robes and white armor for the late emperor, preparing to drive straight to recover Yanjing, rebuild the country, and eliminate the chief culprits. But where did they know that the world is unpredictable, and the changes that come are not what they expected? (190) (End of Chapter 17)
