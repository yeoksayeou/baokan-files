### British Foreign Secretary Receives Ambassador Koo, Discusses the Urgent Situation in the Far East, Observers in London Speculate Japan is Waiting for an Opportunity to Attack the Soviet Union, Democratic Front Prepares to Prevent Japanese Advance to the South

United Press International, London, 21st - Foreign Secretary Eden met with Chinese Ambassador Dr. Koo Vi Kyuin yesterday to discuss the new Japanese government and the situation in the Soviet Union. Observers here say that if Japan's aim was to cause democratic countries and the Soviet Union to speculate, then Japan's aim has already been achieved. After the formation of the new Japanese cabinet, the initial reaction of diplomatic circles here to the situation in the Pacific was cautious and not fearful. However, they now believe that the Japanese army will not act immediately. They also believe that the Japanese army may postpone its southward advance and is currently preparing to attack the Soviet Union at the earliest and best opportunity. It is believed that Tokyo still wants to continue negotiations with the United States. Many believe that this is Japan's attempt to delay time in order to quickly prepare for war with the Soviet Union. Observers here have learned that President Roosevelt's negotiations with Nomura have a practical basis for negotiation, according to public statements. However, the new Prime Minister Tojo is less inclined to reconciliation with the United States than the former Prime Minister Konoe. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has moved a large number of troops from the Far East to the European front, which explains the development of events in Tokyo. Observers point out that Tojo holds the dual positions of Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, which means that when Tojo wants Japan to go to war, he only needs to turn a switch, while Konoe had to consult or negotiate with military personnel. It is believed here that if war breaks out, it is expected that the Japanese army's actions will extend from northern Manchuria to Vladivostok and Chita, and from northern China to Inner Mongolia, and then to Outer Mongolia and enter Chita.

Reuters, Rangoon, 21st - Burma is now preparing for all kinds of changes. Developments in the Far East will soon place Burma on the front line. However, the military and civilians here still maintain their calm, determined, and prepared attitude. A key official told a Reuters reporter that although no one in Burma wants war, the aggressors will see Burma ready to defend itself. In recent months, the strength of British, Indian, and Burmese troops in Burma has greatly increased and can cope with any eventuality.

Reuters, Rangoon, 21st - The New Light of Burma newspaper stated that the Burmese people believe that Japan cannot act rashly because Japan already knows the strength of the British position in the Far East. It also said that Japan will find it impossible to destroy the Burma Road.

Reuters, Canberra, 20th - Australian opposition leader Fadden criticized the Far East situation yesterday, guaranteeing that the opposition party will fully cooperate with the current government in taking necessary measures to protect the security of Australia and the British Empire. Fadden also emphasized that all parties agree with Australian Prime Minister Curtin's statement that Australia wants to maintain peace in the Pacific, but stated that if it is necessary to resist aggression, the people of the British Empire will fight shoulder to shoulder. Australia seeks survival, so war efforts must not be slackened for a moment, and production must be maintained and expanded. He also said that the United States' cooperation with Australia in dealing with the Far East situation is deeply appreciated, and Australia has been greatly encouraged by the US policy.

Reuters, London, 21st - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that, reviewing the naval situation in the Far East, although the Japanese government is in a strong position to launch an offensive, it is also susceptible to the feeling of being blockaded, and all supplies will be effectively cut off.

Reuters, Manila, 21st - Sixteen American pilots, flying several Navy patrol bombers across the Pacific to the Dutch East Indies to strengthen the Dutch East Indies air force, have now arrived here. The bombers ordered by the Dutch East Indies are of the same type as the Catalina bombers used by the British Air Force in the Far East. As for the route of these bombers from the United States to the Dutch East Indies, it has not been announced.

### President Roosevelt Orders Acceleration of Aid to the Soviet Union, Harriman Reports on the Negotiation Process, White House Calls Key Officials for a Meeting, Treasury Announces a $30 Million Loan to the Soviet Union

United Press International, Washington, 21st - President Roosevelt returned to the capital at 9 a.m. today and will accelerate aid to the Soviet Union, as this is most important for the Far East. Many expect that the Japanese will primarily consider whether the German army can inflict a truly fatal blow on the Soviet Union before taking any action. The Nazis are now only half an hour's flight away from Moscow. Unless President Roosevelt orders all active aircraft to fly to the Soviet Union today, it will be difficult for aid to reach the Soviet Union in the shortest possible time. At a time when the United States is strengthening its defenses in the Far East to prevent Japanese action, sending American planes to help the Soviet Union makes it difficult to draw any conclusions from any discussion of the Soviet issue. Some military experts have expressed concern that because the United States is providing the Soviet Union with a large amount of aid, it will inevitably reduce its ability to fulfill its commitments to providing supplies to Britain. However, the government is currently resolving this issue at a very fast pace, believing that the President feels that the main anti-Axis line today is the line with Moscow in the rear. There are several air routes to the Soviet Union. In addition to passing through Canada and Alaska, a small number of American bombers also reach the Soviet Union through other routes. All aircraft transported to the Soviet Union through various routes are clearly ordered by Britain and transferred to the Soviet Union. Canada has paid US$9 million to build four wilderness airfields between Alaska and the Soviet Union. Thousands of Canadian defense workers have already cleared the weeds from these airfields, so these airfields can be used.

United Press International, Hyde Park, 21st - President Roosevelt ordered the acceleration of aid to the Soviet Union after a three-hour meeting with Harriman yesterday. This order was issued after Harriman reported that he "believed that the Soviet army was capable of continuing to resist." The President then sent Mr. Harriman to Washington by naval transport plane, ordering him to meet with officials from the State Department and the Army and Navy Departments, and then meet with President Roosevelt at the White House on Tuesday. President Roosevelt was scheduled to return to Washington by special train last night. When asked if Mr. Harriman had brought a note from Stalin to President Roosevelt, he hesitated for a moment and replied, "I'd better leave what I should say until tomorrow." President Roosevelt is scheduled to meet with the "Big Four" of Congress on Tuesday, namely Vice President Wallace, Senate Majority Leader Barkley, House Majority Leader McCormack, House Speaker Rayburn, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally.

Reuters, Washington, 10th - US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently stated that the US Treasury has loaned $30 million in cash to the Soviet Union, with gold to be delivered by the Soviet Union in the future as collateral. A batch of Soviet gold has already arrived in the United States at the end of this week to repay the $10 million borrowed by the United States two months ago, 25 days earlier than the original repayment deadline. The Soviet Union plans to deliver gold within 180 days to pay off the $30 million loan. It is reported that this loan will be used to purchase military supplies in the United States. This $30 million is allocated from the US Treasury's stabilization fund, not from regular expenses.

### British Factory Representatives Urge Expansion of Aid to the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 21st - A delegation of representatives from nine important machine factories in northwest London went to 10 Downing Street today and presented a resolution to the Prime Minister, requesting greater efforts to aid the Soviet Union and expressing their determination to support the proposal to open a Western front and intensify the movement to increase production.

### The Soviet Union Has Two New Ports in the Far East that Can Receive US Supplies

United Press International, Washington, 21st - Authoritative sources said yesterday that the Soviet Union has two new ports in the Far East ready to receive US military supplies, allowing for smaller items. It also said that both ports are outside the so-called Japanese sphere of influence, which makes it unnecessary for US-Soviet transportation to rely solely on Vladivostok. It also said that one is Nogayev on the north of Vladivostok, and the other is Kamchatka.

### Burmese Prime Minister Meets with Churchill Twice to Discuss Burmese Affairs

Reuters, London, 21st - Burmese Prime Minister Saw, who is currently visiting Britain, has met with British Prime Minister Churchill twice. During their second meeting, they discussed Burmese affairs for three hours. Saw will visit Churchill again before leaving Britain. Saw has also met with Indian and Burmese Affairs Minister Amery twice and is scheduled to meet for the third time tonight. Saw and Treasury Secretary Wood also discussed the economic impact of Burma's war efforts on Burma. According to Saw, the recent freeze order has dealt a major blow to Burma. The Japanese and Chinese occupied areas are now our only cotton market. We have lost the European rice market. The Japanese market may also be lost next year. The government I lead is responsible for protecting the interests of rice and cotton producers. I feel that the British government should provide relief. I have discussed this with the Treasury Secretary and will continue to visit him in the future. I have also discussed various issues concerning the immigration of Chinese people into Burma with government representatives.

### Dispatching Large Troops for Necessary Preparations, China Decides to Deter Japan's New Offensive, New Troops from Southwest Provinces Head to the Front Lines, Striving for Final Victory with a National Policy of Resolute Struggle

Chongqing - According to news from a certain military agency here, after the change of the Japanese cabinet, the Japanese army in China has been frequently mobilized, and there is a sign that it will launch an all-out offensive against China. While closely monitoring the actions of the Japanese army, the Chinese authorities are now dispatching large troops and starting to make necessary military deployments and preparations on various fronts. Before the Japanese army takes action, they will give them a head-on blow. New troops from Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guangxi have been moving to the front lines in recent days to prepare for battle. Military authorities have stated that no matter where the Japanese army launches an offensive, the Chinese army will strike them. (Reported on the 21st)

Chongqing - All sectors of Chinese society are now paying attention to the attitude that Britain and the United States will adopt after the change of the Japanese cabinet. Well-informed Chinese people believe that the new Japanese cabinet will neither advance to the south nor to the north, but will focus its efforts on resolving the China Incident, while at the same time making gestures of advancing to the south or to the north in order to extort concessions from Britain and the United States. All sectors of Chinese society are not asking what kind of active retaliatory plans Britain and the United States will make when Japan advances to the south or to the north, but want to ask what actions Britain and the United States will take when Japan launches a new offensive in China in an attempt to overthrow Chongqing. The Chinese authorities are encouraging the people to prepare for a solitary struggle, but also say that China's successful struggle will also help the democratic countries and protect the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East. Therefore, now that they hear that British and American people seem to feel that the situation is easing based on the belief that the new Japanese cabinet will continue to talk to the United States and that Japan may not immediately advance to the south or to the north, they are naturally disappointed. The Central Daily News stated that the United States should stop the US-Japan talks and intensify economic pressure on Japan. Only if the United States adopts this tough attitude can it eliminate the danger of the war extending to the Pacific. The Central Daily News also assured the United States that China will expand the scope of its counter-attacks against the Japanese army in China to support the United States, and hopes that Britain, Australia, India, Canada, and New Zealand will provide effective cooperation. (Reuters, 20th)

Chongqing - Executive Yuan Secretary-General Jiang Tingfu attended a press conference this afternoon to report on the international situation, saying, "According to my observation, the change of the Japanese cabinet is not a change of policy. Japan has its established national policy and it is historical. The Japanese people's observation of the world situation is also the same as that of the Italians. Germany is now in a better situation, so the Japanese believe that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Japan and will never change its aggressive national policy. This is one of the meanings of the Tojo cabinet. One is to strengthen internal unity of will, and all democratic countries should intensify their unity. The second is a threatening posture towards Central America, attempting to lift the economic blockade by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. All countries should be extra calm and wait in formation. What is gratifying is that the British and American governments and people have seen through their tricks and are not showing weakness. The US's precautions in the Western Pacific are a clear proof. At this time, China should respond to everything with a national policy of resolute struggle. China has been fighting alone for four years, and now it does not expect other countries to fight for it, or Japan to turn to other countries to fight. However, Japan's advance to the north or to the south is all within our expectations, and all democratic countries must still be on guard." Therefore, Jiang also talked about the Soviet war, saying that the Soviet people's heroic resistance is greatly admired by us. With our experience, we can best understand the difficulties of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union is actually in a better position than China, so no matter how fierce the German attack is, we believe that the Soviet Union will be able to fight to the end.

Editorial

### The Turbulent Far East

A common assertion recently is that the only illusion Japan was waiting for before taking major action in the Far East was Germany's victory over the Soviet Union. Therefore, as soon as the situation in Moscow became critical, people immediately realized that the time for Japan to take major external actions was approaching. This is one. In recent years, Japan's aggressive ambitions have been strong. Since the outbreak of the European war, there has hardly been a day without talk of taking the opportunity to take risks abroad. The reason why it has been able to restrain itself somewhat is probably because veteran statesmen and members of the stable faction dare not make a desperate gamble. The representative of these prudent elements is the Konoe Cabinet. Therefore, as soon as people heard about the fall of the Third Konoe Cabinet, they naturally assumed that it symbolized the rise of the extreme faction and the subsequent implementation of foreign adventures. This is two. These two points are the factors that have caused major unrest in the Far East situation in recent days. However, looking deeper, the situation in Moscow is still uncertain. The chances of success and failure are at least equal for both Germany and the Soviet Union. Moreover, the successor to the Konoe Cabinet is not a well-known radical figure, but the more cautious Tojo. As a result, everyone immediately felt that although the Far East crisis has become unprecedentedly acute, the breaking point is not now. This has created the special phenomenon of the current Far East atmosphere being outwardly relaxed but inwardly tense.

Of course, from this change in the Japanese Cabinet, anyone must accept an objective fact, namely, that Japan has replaced its ambition to avoid direct conflict with powers such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union with a spirit that prides itself on adventurous actions abroad. The first step of a major action has finally been taken. From now on, the international community must be vigilant about its actual actions at all times and make various preparations for any eventuality. Analyzing the composition of the Tojo Cabinet, the most important cabinet positions, in addition to Navy Minister Shimada, Finance Minister Kaya, and Foreign Minister Togo, the Prime Minister, Army Minister, and Interior Minister are all held by Tojo himself. If viewed from one perspective, if the Tojo Cabinet cannot find suitable figures to assume the important responsibilities of Army Minister and Interior Minister, then this may be said to be its greatest inherent weakness, indicating that it is not receiving full cooperation from all parties, and its future is of course doomed to failure. However, conversely, if this is precisely the characteristic of Tojo's dictatorship, which can give him the convenience of unifying the domestic front, then this is precisely its strength, and it is all the more close to taking practical action abroad. Regarding this point, the future performance of events will of course provide a clear answer.

Looking at Japan's various expressions and arguments in recent days, it seems that the illusion of advancing north, advancing south, and even advancing west to completely defeat China is emerging one after another. The so-called "advancing north" of course means taking advantage of the urgent situation on the western front of the Soviet Union to suddenly focus its external actions on the Soviet Union. Either use troops to attack the Soviet Union's Maritime Province and Siberia to echo Germany and Italy in Europe. Or make major demands on the Soviet Union, forcing it to withdraw its military forces stationed in the east. Or even propose to the Soviet Union to mediate the German-Soviet war, first obtain some benefits, and then work with Germany and Italy to establish a new order on both the east and west sides. These items are all included in Japan's current ideal northern advance program. Advancing south, on the other hand, means taking advantage of the situation in which Britain and the United States are concentrating their efforts to aid the Soviet Union to suddenly launch a large-scale invasion of Thailand and the Dutch East Indies. Either use military force or use diplomatic threats to achieve the goal of completely controlling this area economically, politically, and even strategically. Force Britain and the United States to submit to it and recognize Japan's hegemony in East Asia. At the same time, an incidental effect would be to completely cut off China's southwestern international transportation routes. As for advancing west, of course, it means using all its strength and methods to achieve its so-called goal of resolving the China Incident. The conditions for these larger external adventurous actions and preparations have long been ripe from Japan's subjective perspective, and after the various preparations before and after this cabinet change, they have of course taken a step forward. In addition, looking at the three targets, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and China, individually, it seems that the opportunity given to Japan to take greater adventurous actions is indeed greater than at any time before. Under this comparison and synthesis, it seems that the possibility of Japan taking concrete action is also greater than at any time before. However, there is a very important point here, and that is the unprecedented situation of the great unity of all anti-aggression countries such as China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. Its role is sufficient to offset any other turbulent factors, and ultimately make Japan's choice not the path of advancing south, advancing north, or advancing west, but to submit to the total power of all countries, or to take a desperate gamble and break through.

Finally, we must point out that what has created Japan's current phenomenon of urgently wanting to take action abroad is fundamentally not the strengthening of its national power or the real favorable international situation, but rather the simultaneous aggravation of its internal and external crises. The standard for testing whether it will take further action abroad lies not in the positive aspect, but rather in whether its internal command and control is strong and whether it can break the diplomatic deadlock. This is truly a very rare and dangerous situation! Therefore, if Japan ever takes further action abroad one day, then the meaning, of course, is that it indicates a state of chaos in its domestic order, coupled with its international crisis being completely unsolvable. The future of this kind of adventurous action is not difficult to imagine.

### Britain and the United States Should Jointly Warn Japan to Stop - US-Japan Talks Will Continue - Japan's Two Hopes Will Be Difficult to Fulfill

Reuters, London, 21st - The tense tone of British newspapers when Tojo first formed his cabinet is now gradually calming down. According to reports from diplomatic reporters, the authorities do not believe that Tojo really intends to go to war. Although newspapers predict that the British and American governments will jointly warn the Japanese government that either advancing south or advancing north will cause serious consequences, it is now known that the British government has not yet issued any new warnings. The British ambassador to Japan, Craigie, will visit the new Japanese Foreign Minister Togo as soon as possible to clearly convey the British government's inability to accept Japan's new aggressive actions. A London reporter for "The Yorkshire Post" discussed the question of whether a Japanese attack on the Soviet Union would "automatically" put Japan in a state of war with Britain. According to the reporter's opinion, if the word "automatically" is taken literally, the answer will be uncertain, but if Tokyo invades the Soviet Union, it will produce the most serious events not only for Britain but also for the United States. "The Yorkshire Post" mentioned the possibility of warning Japan in an editorial, saying that American public opinion is willing to approve the necessary external guarantees and the defense of the Siberian border is not what we need solid land military force, this is a subtle problem. British newspapers have different opinions on Washington's views. Some, such as "The Times," believe that it is hopeless to find a solution with the Japanese government, which is trying to expand its power, without abandoning China. At the same time, a small number of newspapers, such as "News Chronicle," cite New York intelligence that the United States is preparing to consider a solution along the lines of the British and American governments guaranteeing Japan's economic opportunities in China while Japan abandons its political ambitions in China. However, in any case, the resumption of the Washington talks is generally believed to be a sign of hope. At the same time, it is reported that the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Wakasugi, has declared to the US Under Secretary of State Welles that the first step towards a better understanding is for the United States to stop its war material shipments to aid the Soviet Union. News from Shanghai also says that the Japanese government is now planning to propose to the Soviet Union that Vladivostok and the Maritime Province be demilitarized zones.

Reuters, London, 21st - "News Chronicle" reported that Tojo's current remarks are the same as those Hitler used to make when planning for war. The talk of encirclement is completely unfounded. In fact, Japan is the same as Germany, and has promoted the existence of a defensive alliance due to its own aggression. The time has come for Britain and the United States to issue a joint declaration stating that if Japan attacks any country again, it will face immediate joint war. Only this kind of direct declaration has a chance to stop Tokyo at this stage.

Reuters, Tokyo, 21st - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii said at a press conference this morning, answering a question from a German reporter about reports that Britain and the United States plan to seek a base in eastern Siberia, that he does not believe this kind of rumor. For various obvious reasons, this is unlikely to happen. Asked if this would conflict with the spirit of the US-Japan talks in Washington if it happened, Ishii replied that of course it would conflict. Asked about the progress of the Washington talks, Ishii replied, "All I can say is that the Washington talks have not broken down." Ishii did not make a substantial statement on the Tojo government's attitude towards these talks, only saying, "Please make your own judgments based on the Foreign Minister's broadcast speech last night."

Reuters, London, 21st - Today's "Daily Telegraph" and "Morning Post" commented on the "peace talks" in Washington, saying that no matter what means are used to avoid war in the Pacific, this matter is entirely due to Japan's fear of the resistance it will encounter. To make the radical elements in Japan cautious, there is nothing better than the definite unity between the British Empire, the Netherlands, and the United States. What Japan hopes to gain from these talks is still a mystery. However, it can be asserted that Japan's two main hopes for the United States, (1) recognition of "co-prosperity" and (2) the actual relaxation of economic sanctions, are unlikely to be fulfilled. The fact that Tojo has not definitively cancelled these talks, no matter what their purpose, always gives people the impression that Japan may not plan to take amazing risks in the near future. However, if there are any developments in the Soviet war that cause the situation to change sharply, then a different view should be taken.

### Togo Explains Policy - Unification of Diplomacy and Military Affairs - Will Not Hesitate to Sacrifice to Achieve Goals - New Japanese Cabinet Holds First Meeting

United Press, Tokyo, 21st - New Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo gave a broadcast speech to the nation last night, saying that the honor of the Japanese Empire should be maintained at any cost. Therefore, our country's diplomacy will follow the path of closer unification of diplomatic and military policies. He said, "It goes without saying that the ultimate goal of Japanese diplomacy is to maintain and promote world peace. However, in terms of our country's survival and honor, we are determined to defend the country to the death and strive to achieve our historical mission. For this reason, Japan's policy will be implemented in close connection with diplomatic and military policies. This policy, based on justice and reality, will certainly achieve the unhindered development of Japan's destiny." Togo said that all countries should suffer "great difficulties" as the price of evolution. He concluded, "When our country can overcome the current trials, the destiny of Japan will be limitless."

Reuters, Tokyo, 21st - The new Japanese Cabinet held a meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence today, and all cabinet members attended. Foreign Minister Togo gave a detailed report on the reports received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from major Japanese embassies abroad regarding the criticisms of the establishment of the new government by Britain, the United States, Germany, and Italy.

Reuters, Tokyo, 21st - Nishiyone Hiko, an advisor to Takekawa, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, has been appointed as a Foreign Minister, replacing Amano.

### Japan Bombed - Realistic Air Defense Drills

Havas, Tokyo, 20th - Comprehensive air defense drills have been held in various parts of central Japan in recent days. One of the highlights was a scenario in which simulated enemy planes bombed the Nara Racecourse. Straw and grass were piled up in the stadium to represent houses, and all the bombs used were real. After the straw piles were set on fire by the bombs, members of the air defense organization took action to put out the fire. At the time, no fewer than 200,000 people were watching, including Lieutenant General Fujii, the commander of the Central District Army, and Lieutenant General Saki, the commander of the Osaka Garrison. At the same time, Osaka Castle was also a simulated bombing target. Male and female air defense team members participated in extinguishing incendiary bombs. In Osaka Port, the "Nikko Maru" steamship of the East Asia Steamship Company was also assumed to have been set on fire by enemy plane bombing. Dockworkers and the civil defense team worked together to carry out liquid rescue. Rear Admiral Okawa, commander of the Central Naval District, also personally supervised. In addition, personnel from the Osaka Wireless Broadcasting Station also assumed that the station was destroyed by enemy plane bombing and broadcast temporarily on the streets. All the drills will be completed tomorrow.

### US Secretary of State Hull Condemns Piracy - US-German Diplomatic Relations May Be Severed - Republicans Demand Repeal of Neutrality Act

United Press, Washington, 21st - Since the Navy Department announced the news that the warship "Kearny" was attacked by a torpedo, injuring ten people and leaving eleven missing, and that the attacker was a German submarine, the traditional party boundaries in Congress have been swept away yesterday. Prominent Republican senators, including White, Reed, and Austin, and Wilkie, discussed the matter and have demanded the complete repeal of the Neutrality Act. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull made a speech, saying that Hitler is a robber. Hull said that this incident is another proof of Germany's attempt to control the seas. A reporter asked if he would protest to Germany about this matter. Hull said that protesting is useless when dealing with international robbers. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 12 to 9 yesterday to decide to conduct a closed-door review of the Merchant Ship Armament Act, which is scheduled to begin today and end on Friday.

Havas, Washington, 20th - The incident of the German submarine attacking the US warship "Kearny" has caused a national outcry. Although there is a possibility that President Roosevelt will declare the severance of diplomatic relations with Germany, there is no definite indication from the official side.

### German Offensive on Moscow Thwarted by Red Army Counterattack - Germans Attempt to Break Through Soviet Positions with Tanks - Fierce Resistance from Red Army Results in Heavy German Losses

United Press, London, 21st - British military authorities have recently stated that the Germans have apparently changed their main offensive strategy. From Mozhaisk eastward and southward to Maloyaroslavets, their mechanized units have charged from here to within 50 miles of Moscow, which is the closest point to Moscow since the offensive on the Soviet capital on the 19th. Powerful German forces are relentlessly hammering northward along the Kaluga-Moscow railway. British military experts say that the fiercest fighting is currently taking place in Naro-Fominsk, north of Kaluga, as the Germans are now trying to reach Podolsk, which is located along the Tula-Moscow railway line, north of Naro-Fominsk. They also pointed out that Marshal Timoshenko must now establish a vast military defense, such as blocking German tanks and armored vehicles in the Mozhaisk area. However, they stressed that if Marshal Timoshenko cannot establish a strong defense north of Maloyaroslavets, then the Nazis can use their main force attacking Mozhaisk to attack south and then attack the Mozhaisk defense forces from the side. The official Moscow war commentary has been silent on the Moscow war for two days. Now that it has broken the silence again, it also proves that the situation is very serious. The commentary revealed that the famous Nazi blitzkrieg has been implemented again, and the weakness it seeks to exploit seems to be Maloyaroslavets. The official Moscow commentary said that the Soviet army is now bravely resisting the enemy's tanks and infantry, which are relentlessly attacking the main front line. The official commentary revealed that the situation is not much different from what was announced in the previous communiqué, but it declared that the Soviet army's resistance is fiercest in Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets. One of the Soviet army's units, after the artillery was ready, attacked the German-held town of K. It is heard that there is fierce fighting on the road leading to this town and in the streets inside it, involving giant tanks and infantry. The commentary also said that after the Germans concentrated a large army to attack Mozhaisk, they advanced several miles, but suffered heavy losses in the tank battle. Later, another advance was thwarted by the counterattack of Commander Iruchensko. In this battle, countless German soldiers' corpses were left behind, and the number of destroyed tanks abandoned on the battlefield was countless. The fighting in the Maloyaroslavets area is also extremely fierce. The Germans concentrated a large force of tanks and infantry there, launching a fierce attack, repeatedly trying to break through the Soviet defense line, but all failed.

International News, London, 21st - The Soviet High Command today announced in a broadcast message on Moscow Radio that the German army has been completely halted 57 miles west and 65 miles southwest of Moscow. The Red Army communiqué declared that after the fiercest offensive on the 14th, although the German army desperately tried to break through the Soviet defense line, it ultimately came to a complete halt. The German army advanced on the Soviet army with a large force of tanks and armored units as the vanguard, but the Red Army, with the help of British pilots flying aircraft, finally broke through the German vanguard. At the same time, it is reported that Soviet Supreme Commander Stalin is making an inspection trip along the 3,000-mile central front line in an armored train. Today's Moscow communiqué said that fierce fighting is taking place around Taganrog, and admitted that the left wing of the Soviet army in the Donets River basin and at the entrance to the Caucasus has been threatened by the German army. At the same time, it is reported that the German pressure on Leningrad has been reduced due to the strong counterattack of Marshal Voroshilov's troops.

Germany Claims to Have Occupied Stalino - Soviet Army Withdraws from Taganrog

United Press, Berlin, 21st - The German High Command recently stated that German and Italian troops yesterday occupied the surrounding area of Stalino, a major military equipment production area in the Donets Basin, and Alpine troops have occupied the city. The city was named Stalino in honor of Stalin.

Reuters, Moscow, 21st - A frontline reporter for Pravda said this afternoon that the Soviet army in eastern Ukraine, after several days of bloody fighting, has retreated to a new line of defense pre-arranged in the direction of Taganrog under the pressure of enemy forces that are superior in number after dealing a severe blow to the enemy.

German Troops Attacking Murmansk Repulsed by Determined Soviet Resistance

Reuters, Moscow, 21st - A Pravda dispatch said that German reports that Murmansk suffered heavy damage are actually only one department store, two children's hospitals, one racetrack, and several wooden houses that were destroyed. The battle for Murmansk is currently underway, and it is not taking place near the city, but in the mountains slightly farther from the city. In the first few days of the war, the German army did force the Soviet army to advance and attack the Lizha River. A Soviet squadron has destroyed more than 300 German aircraft. The enemy's attacks have met with determined Soviet resistance everywhere. The enemy army has lost 2,000 officers and soldiers on this front line.

Soviet Union Moves Capital to Samara - US Ambassador Has Arrived There

Reuters, New York, 21st - The Moscow reporter for the US National Broadcasting Company is currently in Kuibyshev, 550 miles southeast of Moscow on the Volga River. According to his dispatch, the Soviet government has moved to this place. The city, formerly known as Samara, is one of the important ports on the Volga River and is located in the newly developed oil area. The area produced 6,000 tons of oil per day in 1939 and is known as the second Baku. A pipeline was planned in 1930 to run from Kuibyshev to the Caspian Sea near Amba.

United Press, Kuibyshev, 21st - US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt and other diplomatic personnel and news reporters arrived here last night after a five-day journey from Moscow. Diplomatic personnel and news reporters came here by train. US embassy personnel also provided food to Americans. Kuibyshev has a population of 171,000 and is 750 miles from Moscow by train on the Volga River. Due to the busy transportation of munitions, the journey takes a total of five days.

### Annual Meeting of the Engineering Society: Admonition from Chairman Chiang: No National Defense, No Nation; Only Science Can Save the Nation

Guiyang: The full text of Chairman Chiang's admonition to the 10th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers in Guiyang is as follows:

To Chairman Ling of the Guiyang Chinese Institute of Engineers, and all assembled: As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, I am pleased to learn that your esteemed institute is holding its 10th annual meeting and 30th-anniversary celebration. You have gathered experts in engineering from across the country to discuss national construction. The accomplishments will be substantial, and I anticipate great success. It is deeply gratifying. Although the modern engineering construction industry in our country began in the late Qing Dynasty, its true development began with the birth of the Republic of China and the establishment of your esteemed institute. Over the past thirty years, our country has made arduous efforts to build and create. Although the scale of modern national defense is not yet complete, the initial foundation of material construction has been laid. The construction of roads, mines, shipyards, water conservancy, and military industries represents the achievements of many pioneering engineering scholars. Compared to the achievements of the first thirty years, the results are many times greater. This is truly something for our engineering community to celebrate. It is a pity that due to the many difficulties facing the country and the incomplete use of human resources, the research in science has not been extensive, the progress of industry has been slow, leading to economic stagnation and a lack of national defense. This has resulted in foreign aggression and unprecedented sacrifices for the country. Our compatriots, after the lessons of these four years of arduous struggle, deeply understand the importance of national defense and industry. Therefore, amidst heroic struggles, people from all levels are working together to promote industrial construction. However, defeating the enemy still requires continuous efforts, and the success of national construction cannot be achieved overnight. With the rapid progress of science in the world, our country's industry still lags behind. From now on, we must further promote the cultivation of engineering talent at all levels, promote cooperation between entrepreneurs and scholars, enhance the spirit of research and advancement in the engineering community, facilitate mutual assistance and cooperation among various scientists, and further promote communication and cooperation in international academic technology. Then the achievements of research will be significant, and the efficiency of the enterprise will also increase accordingly.

National Economy and People's Livelihood

All rely on it. Furthermore, the survival of modern nations depends not only on an outstanding national spirit but also on solid national defense preparations. Engineering science and engineering enterprises are the true foundation of national defense. Over the past year, I, Zhongzheng, have frequently proclaimed to the people the importance of consolidating national defense. National defense is crucial to the life of the nation; without national defense, there is no nation. Therefore, I often say that our current great goal is to strive for final victory in the war and achieve absolute security in national defense in nation-building. Whether it is the army, navy, or air force, only with the progress of engineering can we maintain the superiority of our national defense capabilities. Transportation also relies on the progress of engineering to strengthen the application of national defense capabilities. Sufficient food and soldiers require the progress of engineering to enhance the source of national defense capabilities. The Founding Father earnestly taught us to strive for science and to correct bad habits with the omnipotence of our hands. How to cultivate the skills and habits of the people in using machinery and make science to save the nation a common understanding across the country is fundamental to the establishment of national defense. In order to gradually realize the national defense plan, the central government has promulgated the Outline of the Three-Year Construction Plan. Many aspects of economic construction depend on the research and efforts of our engineering scholars. As for the Founding Father's industrial plan, it is the grand strategy for our nation-building and the key plan for national defense. After the last annual meeting of your esteemed institute, you established the Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan Research Association, aiming to classify and discuss detailed and feasible plans. I heard that the basic figures have been roughly drafted and will be reported and discussed in detail at this annual meeting. I firmly believe that by gathering the expertise of many scholars,

Pooling Wisdom and Gathering Ideas

Will surely make precise contributions to the foundation of national defense construction in the future. This is what our country urgently needs today, and it is what I, Zhongzheng, particularly hope for. The establishment of your esteemed institute coincided with the birth of the Republic of China. This thirty-year period is the era when the initial foundation of engineering construction was laid in our country. It is also an era of arduous construction and active revival for our country. In recent years, in the entrance examinations of universities across the country, the number of applicants who wish to study engineering has often been many times greater than that of other departments. This trend can be seen generally. Therefore, it is the important mission of your esteemed institute to promote the past achievements, guide the future, and complete the great cause of national construction. I know that you will cherish this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and fulfill your responsibility to serve the country through academic endeavors. (21st telegram)

### Applying to the Hong Kong Exchange Equalization Fund for Foreign Exchange to Purchase Wheat and Flour; Efforts to Promote Price Management Methods; Resolutely Suppressing Speculation and Profiteering; If Retailers Do Not Cooperate, Implement Decisive Control

The Shanghai Municipal Council is promoting its efforts to suppress the prices of goods in Shanghai, and has applied to the Hong Kong Exchange Equalization Fund for foreign exchange to transport wheat and flour into Shanghai. The Shanghai Municipal Council's adoption of this measure is to assist wheat and flour wholesalers, as these merchants are unable to obtain foreign exchange from the Exchange Equalization Fund to continue transporting wheat and flour at normal prices. An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council said that if the application for foreign exchange is approved, the council will maintain control over the import and retail of wheat, just like the current management of rice. The amount of foreign exchange requested by the Shanghai Municipal Council is unknown, but officials said that "the amount is sufficient to meet all legitimate needs."

The Retail Price of Rice Has Not Increased

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office issued a public announcement yesterday to correct the false rumors of increasing the retail price of foreign rice, "The price of foreign rice sold by this council is currently still 117 yuan per stone (net weight of 160 market catties) and has not been increased. Citizens can purchase from rice shops as usual. This announcement is hereby issued to dispel misunderstandings from the outside world." The Shanghai Municipal Council is purchasing large quantities of foreign rice, transporting it to Shanghai for sale at fair prices, and the Public Warehouse Committee is entrusting rice shops in the two concessions to publicly sell the second batch of more than 48,000 bags of warehouse rice, aiming to relieve civilians and stabilize the entire people's food in Shanghai. The previous regulations stipulated that all rice shops selling rice were only allowed to retail to food households but were not allowed to sell the rice at high prices in the market or hide it from sale. However, reliable news has been obtained from all parties that some rice shops are disregarding the livelihood of civilians and secretly selling the low-priced foreign rice at high prices in the market to obtain illegal profits. If this abnormal phenomenon continues to grow, it will have a very large impact on the future of people's food.

This Time's Approach Is Extremely Cautious

The Taipans Times reported that, according to officials who told reporters, the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession has now begun to suppress the speculation and profiteering merchants in this city, but is doing so in a moderate way to prevent counterproductive results, as stepping on subtle economic difficulties is harmful rather than beneficial, and only turns good intentions into bad ones. However, the council's actions against speculators are extremely resolute, and the proposed policy is bound to be implemented. As the Russian proverb says, "The more cautious you are in planning, the greater the gain." The Shanghai Municipal Council's behavior is based on this. When analyzing the Shanghai Municipal Council's communique revealing the council's request for approval of "new bylaws," officials admitted that its content was more cautious than what the public, who have long suffered from rising prices, expected. Therefore, there are superior reasons to add explanations on this point. First, the Shanghai Municipal Council's communique released yesterday directly pointed out that "In the current situation, the most urgent task is to find ways to control speculation and profiteering in essential goods." Of course, no one will oppose this public opinion.

If Necessary, Monopoly Sales Will Be Decisively Implemented

The opinions obtained by the Shanghai Municipal Council from experts revealed the panic among merchants. They feared that implementing arbitrary interference in normal trade would cause supplies transported to Shanghai to be diverted to South China and other places, and Shanghai would therefore lack inventory and prices would increase further. At that time, retailers would be even more speculative and profiteering. They explained that this is why the Shanghai Municipal Council does not want to control the business of exporters at present, but only focuses on managing the unreasonable behavior of other retailers. However, if the Shanghai Municipal Council deems it necessary to import other essential goods using methods similar to those for rice, it will undoubtedly do so decisively. Furthermore, officials also said that the Shanghai Municipal Council believes it is unwise to issue strong measures, as the application of such measures is not only not thorough but also unfair. They also said that comparing the Shanghai Municipal Council with the French Municipal Council is also a mistake, as the status of the French Concession allows the consulate to issue "consular orders," while the Public Concession cannot do so. It was also said that the French Concession can determine prices, and retailers who do not comply with the price limits can be punished, while the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot do so within its current authority.

Requesting the Consular Body to Grant Full Authority

The contents of the "new bylaws" that the Shanghai Municipal Council is currently requesting approval from the Shanghai Consular Body have not been publicly revealed, but according to official claims, in summary, the "new bylaws" are intended to authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council to carry out the same matters as the French Concession, that is, to create regulations for managing the prices of essential goods and to impose fines on retailers who do not comply. It was also revealed that these regulations are under study but have not yet been drafted.

Increased Freight Costs Are the Biggest Stimulus

After the Shanghai Municipal Council announced its efforts to suppress retail prices yesterday (20th), various circles praised the council's stance this morning. It is said that the council's efforts will surely gain the cooperation of the public and retail stores. Recently, many citizens have hoarded food and other supplies at home, causing prices to soar. Now that the two concessions have adopted new measures, their impact will soon be seen. According to business circles, the cost of transporting goods into Shanghai, the freight costs account for 18%. The price of rice and coal is more than 18% lower in their original place of export than here. It can be seen that freight costs are still the main difficulty in suppressing prices. Taking coal prices as an example, there are often some Chinese who obtain several tons of coal and then negotiate prices in tea houses, choosing the highest price to sell, which is 30% more expensive than the price sold by major coal companies.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Suggests Levying Business Tax on Exchanges; Suggestion Has Been Submitted to the General Chamber of Commerce; Strict Procedures for Joining the Silver and Money Guild; Many Newly Established Banks Have Not Joined the Guild

Securities, gold, and commodity exchanges in the Public Concession were initially classified as "Category B" houses according to the special housing tax method established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, with a special tax of 15% per year. Later, after the Advisory Committee revised it, "Category B" houses were merged into "Category A," and the special tax was changed to 8% per year. According to the opinion of the majority of members of the Advisory Committee, "Rather than setting up a separate category for the houses of each exchange to levy a special tax, it is better to tax them in other ways." Based on this point, the Shanghai Municipal Council submitted the matter to the New Tax Source Committee for discussion on levying a new tax on exchange houses in other ways. A decision in principle has now been obtained, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently sought opinions from various exchanges. After the exchanges respond, a final implementation decision will be made.

The General Chamber of Commerce Will Reply

The English-language North China Daily News reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession has drafted a plan to levy a new tax on the monthly turnover of the General Chamber of Commerce and other exchanges, and has submitted this suggestion to the General Chamber of Commerce before making a final decision on this matter. According to reliable business sources, the General Chamber of Commerce will respond to the Shanghai Municipal Council's suggestion soon, but both the chamber and the council have not disclosed the nature of the tax suggestion. All that is known is that this new tax will be based on monthly turnover. It is heard that this new tax is intended to be levied in addition to the special housing tax on business premises that the Shanghai Municipal Council has already announced.

Annual Revenue Could Reach 10 Million Yuan

One view is that the Public Concession authorities could increase revenue by 10 million yuan per year by levying a new tax on market turnover. However, this number is difficult to accurately estimate, as market trading trends vary, and if they fall in certain periods, the amount of tax collected will be very small. It is expected that a total of eight exchanges in the Public Concession, including cotton and rice, red bean curd dregs, wheat and flour, securities, and smaller commodities, will be affected by this new tax. The date of the new tax will depend on when the Shanghai Municipal Council receives a reply from the General Chamber of Commerce, so there is no indication of when it will be levied. It is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council has conducted a thorough study of this new tax before submitting its suggestion to the General Chamber of Commerce.

### Flood Control Equipment Bonds Are Under Discussion

The Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession, in order to prevent flooding within the concession, has recently started to carry out drainage equipment and plans to issue bonds of 4 million yuan to fund this project. After repeated deliberations by the council, a bond issuance method has been drafted. It has been decided to hold another meeting in the Shanghai Municipal Council's conference room at 4:30 pm on the 22nd of this month to make a final decision, so that it can be submitted for discussion at the Shanghai Municipal Council's regular meeting on the 29th of this month. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's past bond issuances, the total amount that had not been repaid by the end of last year was 79,523,958 yuan. Together with the 9 million yuan of bonds issued this year, the total is 88,523,958 yuan. If another 4 million yuan of bonds are issued, the total will reach 92,523,958 yuan.

### White Russian Immigrants Sympathetic to the Soviet Union Will Face Discriminatory Treatment; White Russian Council Plans to Confiscate Their Immigration Certificates; Young Russian Party Members Will Not Be Protected

The North China Daily News reported (20th) that the Seven Seas White Russian Immigration Committee will take severe measures against White Russian immigrants in Shanghai who are sympathetic to the Red Russian government and spreading Soviet propaganda. The committee resolved at a meeting on the 17th of this month that

Many White Russians Are Sympathetic to the Soviet Union

If these White Russians continue to be sympathetic to the Soviet government, they will lose the protection of the committee and their immigration certificates. According to reliable sources, the White Russian Immigration Committee has learned that since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, many White Russians in Shanghai have openly expressed sympathy for the Soviet government's fight against the Nazis and have spread Soviet propaganda among White Russian immigrants. The committee believes that "such behavior promotes the division of the Russian community in this city" and has decided to no longer regard those who express sympathy for the Soviet government and help its propaganda as White Russian immigrants and will confiscate their certificates. In addition, it was also decided to no longer provide protection to members of the Young Russian Party and members of the Return to the Country Federation and to cancel their immigration rights.

The Young Russian Party Supports the War

It is reported that the Young Russian Party published a communique four months ago, signed by the party leader Stepanov, urging all Russians to abandon political disputes and assist their country in fighting against Germany as much as possible. The communique also stated that the Young Russian Party is against the Soviet government, but if the current government continues to defend its homeland for a long time, the party will abandon its previous opposition policy.

### Densely Packed Residents Threaten Health; Last Month's Death Rate Far Exceeded Birth Rate

Since this city became an isolated island, residents have been densely packed in one place, which has greatly affected health, leading to a sharp increase in the death rate and a very serious threat. According to records from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, in September, there were a total of 86 foreign births in the Public Concession, with a birth rate of 15.41 per million. There were 741 Chinese births, while the death toll was 4,133 Chinese and 79 foreigners, which far exceeds the number of births.

### United States and China Daily News Editor Wang Jinquan Kidnapped

Wang Jinquan, the editor of the United States and China Daily News, disappeared suddenly after leaving his residence in the French Concession at around 3:00 pm the day before yesterday. There has been no news so far. It is believed that he has been kidnapped, and the details are being investigated.

### Rumors of General Ships Being Armed; Denied by the United States Naval Community; No Notification of American Ships Leaving the Far East

The English-language North China Daily News reported that the Tokyo branch of the Japanese Domei News Agency reported that the Shanghai Japanese Daily News obtained information from the "Shanghai Shipping Industry" that the American President Lines' Pacific President Taft, President Pierce, and President Cleveland three mail ships have been equipped with anti-aircraft guns, torpedo tubes, and other weapons, and that naval officers have been stationed on the three ships. However, when the Shanghai naval community replied to reporters today (21st), "We recognize that the information transmitted by this news is unfounded," and the President Lines also stated that there was no such news. According to the company's staff, these two mail ships have now been incorporated into the US Army Transportation Corps and are not under the command of the President Lines. These three ships have recently been renamed General Scott, General Braithwaite, and General Holbrook.

The Current Status of American Ships Is Still Uncertain

Regarding the rumor that the United States Navy has ordered all American merchant ships in Asia to immediately sail to "friendly" ports, the Shanghai shipping industry still does not know the truth, and people in American shipping companies in this city have no news to report about how the US Navy's order will affect them. This is because American shipping companies have not received any news that their ships have changed their routes. At the same time, Hermelick, the American Judge who left Shanghai a few months ago to return to the United States for vacation, has arrived in Honolulu by American ship, but it is not known where the ship is now sailing. According to the shipping industry, Shanghai has not received any notification regarding the situation of American ships, but detailed news regarding the recently rumored US Navy order is expected to be received within the next few days.

President Lines Has Also Received No Notification

The China Press also reported that a representative of the American President Lines told reporters yesterday that the President Lines had not received any news from its Manila or San Francisco offices regarding the rumor that the US State Department had ordered the ships to withdraw from the Far Eastern waters. According to the shipping schedule, the President Lines currently has two ships sailing from Honolulu to Shanghai, but it is not known whether these two ships are still sailing to Shanghai or have been recalled to Hawaii. These two ships are President Van Buren and President Madison, which are scheduled to arrive in port in the last week of this month.

### Da De Nan Ship Fire Damage; Preparing for Water Spreading

The French company's mail ship, De Nan, arrived in Shanghai last Friday (17th) from Saigon with a large batch of corn and cotton and a large amount of timber from Little Luzon, and docked at floating pontoon numbers 11 and 12 to unload the timber. At around 3:00 pm the day before yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the cotton hold while unloading the timber. The Haiguan Fire Brigade arrived to put out the fire and extinguished it at around 6:00 pm. The ship was moved from the floating pontoon to the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou this morning to unload corn and fire-damaged cotton. The fire will be spread again in the future. The cause of the fire and the extent of the damage are under investigation.

### Fang Dan Land Tax Case; Consular Court Judgment; Acknowledges the Shanghai Municipal Council's Right to Levy Land Tax; However, Cutting Off Electricity and Water Is Inappropriate

Chinese landowner Zhu Ruqing and others filed a lawsuit against the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Consular Court, claiming that tax should not be levied on Fang Dan land. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the case has been decided, and the judgment of the Consular Court judges, British Consul George and British Consul Rockhead, and Japanese Consul Horiuchi Kansei, was delivered to the plaintiff's lawyers, Liu Shifang and Wang Jian, yesterday afternoon. The main points of the judgment are two: (1) It is recognized that the Shanghai Municipal Council can collect donations on Fang Dan land. (2) The Shanghai Municipal Council's blackmail of cutting off the electricity, telephone lines, and water supply of the buildings on Fang Dan land in order to collect donations is considered illegal. The litigation costs are to be borne equally by the plaintiff and the defendant. It is reported that the facts and legal principles presented by the plaintiff in the lawsuit against the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Consular Court were: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Council has no right to levy taxes on Fang Dan land. (2) Even if it has the right to levy taxes, it should sue the landowner in the Chinese court and should not cut off his electricity, telephone, and water supply. Regarding the question of whether taxes can be levied based on the Land Regulations, the Shanghai Municipal Council should decide on an interpretation through diplomatic means with the Chinese government. Today, the Consular Court did not mention the three points in the judgment, and its judgment on the point of having the right to levy taxes contradicts the judgment of the First Special Court that it has no right to levy taxes, which is noteworthy. If the plaintiff pays taxes, the cost is only tens of thousands of yuan, but if all Fang Dan land is taxed, the amount will be considerable. Yesterday, the plaintiff's lawyers only stated that they are closely watching what measures the Shanghai Municipal Council will take.

### The Ministry of Finance Will Carefully Review Newly Established Banks and Financial Institutions; Strict Procedures for Joining the Silver and Money Guild; Many Newly Established Banks Have Not Joined the Guild

After the entire financial situation in Shanghai was adjusted and stabilized, various industries raised funds to establish new banks and financial institutions, and legally applied to the Ministry of Finance for approval to operate, specializing in deposits, loans, remittances, and all other businesses. The government attaches great importance to the newly established banks and financial institutions in Shanghai. Those who operate without approval will be strictly banned. Those who have been approved to operate must operate within the scope of the law. The examination of new applicants will be strict, and the verification of assets must have documentary evidence. The Silver and Money Guild is also particularly cautious about the membership of new banks and financial institutions in order to prevent abuses and maintain the proper operation of banks and financial institutions.

Newly Established Banks

Yesterday, it was learned from the silver and money industry that: (1) Newly established banks: (A) Those that have opened for business: Qian Qin with a capital of 1 million yuan, Zhong Yong with a capital of 1 million yuan, Tie Ye with a capital of 1 million yuan, Da Gong with a capital of 1 million yuan, Guang Zhong with a capital of 1 million yuan, and He Tai with a capital of 1 million yuan. (B) Banks that have established a founding meeting and are currently preparing: Da Yuan, Chang Cheng, Guo 　, Wu Zhou, Hai Gong Ye, Zhong Mao, Yong Feng, Zhong Guo Gong Ye, Hua Mao, Zhong Guo Yan Ye, Li Min, Shen Zhou, An Hua, Yu Ye, An Li, Da Xin, Zhong Mei, Shang Hai Shi Ye, Zhe Jiang Shang Ye, Zhen Ye, Mao Tai, Da Ye, and Yong Tai, etc. All of the above banks have legally applied to the Ministry for approval to operate, but none have joined the Shanghai Bankers Association as members.

Newly Established Remittance Institutions

(1) Newly established remittance institutions: (A) Those that have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to operate and have joined the Money Industry Guild: Fu Li, Jin Yuan, Xin He, Gong Chang, Yi He, Yong Long, Xin Zhong, Shen De, and Yi Long Guo Yu. (2) Financial institutions that have already held founding meetings and are either doing first trades or are preparing for business include Bao Chang, Tai Lai, Zi Kang, Hui Da, Tong Kang, Jia Chang, Cun Cheng, Rui Yu, An Tai, Nian Feng. Yi Da, Chun Yuan, Ju Kang, Guang Da, Tian Yi, Kai Tai, Da Feng, and Jiu Chang, etc. The minimum capital is 500,000 yuan in national currency. In addition, there are a total of 30 to 40 small financial institutions that have not legally applied to the competent authorities for approval and specialize in various speculative businesses.

Strictly Review and Approve Licenses

According to the Banking Law, banks and financial institutions organized as limited liability companies, limited partnerships, or limited liability partnerships must have a capital of at least 500,000 yuan. Banks and financial institutions organized as unlimited liability companies must have a capital of at least 250,000 yuan. All banks and financial institutions that have been approved for registration should apply to the Ministry of Finance to send someone to verify the assets after all the capital has been fully subscribed and half of the total amount has been collected. If the verification is deemed accurate, a business license will be issued. Few of the above-mentioned newly established banks and financial institutions have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to operate, as the Ministry of Finance is particularly cautious in reviewing the newly established banks and financial institutions in Shanghai. It is not easy to obtain approval unless the procedures are complete.

### Gunfire Incident in the Nanshi Area: Iwakura Shot, Chinese Life Lost – Japanese Employee of China Water and Electric Company Shot Twice While Getting into a Car

Around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, a shooting incident involving a Japanese national occurred on Menghua Street in the Old West Gate area of Nanshi. At approximately 7:25 a.m., Iwakura (age 27), a high-ranking Japanese employee of the China Water and Electric Company's Old West Gate office, was getting into a car in front of a certain address on Menghua Street when two men dressed in black suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. One of them pulled out a handgun and fired three shots. Iwakura, unable to dodge, was hit once, the bullet entering his chest and abdomen. He immediately collapsed in a pool of blood. The shooter, seeing that he had achieved his goal, immediately fled with the gun, disappearing without a trace. Upon receiving the news, the Japanese side immediately dispatched a large contingent of military police to the scene to conduct a thorough search. The Japanese military police also notified the French authorities, who immediately ordered all the iron gates connecting to Nanshi to be sealed off. Meanwhile, the injured man was sent to Fumin Hospital for medical treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died before receiving any treatment.

At the scene of the incident in Nanshi, the Japanese side cut off all traffic in the surrounding area. The search lasted for about three hours, and residents were only allowed to walk around again in the late morning. The iron gates in the French Concession were also reopened at 9:30 a.m. after receiving notification, but only women and children were allowed to enter and exit. Men between the ages of 20 and 40 were not allowed to enter or exit. However, even women, children, and the elderly had to line up and pass through in single file, and were only allowed to pass after a thorough search.

### Puyi Handicraft Cooperative: Using Rags for Relief – Focusing on Handicraft Relief, Implementing Vocational Training

The Puyi Handicraft Cooperative is a relief organization established in Shanghai by Western and Chinese benevolent individuals. It focuses on actively providing relief through handicrafts, collecting used clothing and old items, and employing elderly, disabled, unemployed men, women, and young people to engage in repairing, washing, and sorting activities. It implements vocational training, promotes disaster relief using rags, and provides wages, clothing, and food. Each year, over 35,000 people benefit from this program.

Overview of Work

The workshop serves as the core of all relief work. To address the educational problems of the workers' children and homeless children, it has established a "Free Elementary School" and a "Kindergarten." To address the illnesses of workers and the poor, it has established a clinic. To provide struggling workers and the poor with the opportunity to buy daily necessities at affordable prices, it has opened a "Refugee Store." To ensure that struggling workers can work with peace of mind, it has established a "Free Daycare Center" for infants. For those who are slightly older and unable to pursue further studies, it has established an "Apprentice Class." To alleviate the hunger and panic of workers, it has established "Food Distribution Centers" for children and struggling workers. To expand the scope of relief, it distributes rice, wheat, winter clothing, and cash to extremely poor refugees and those who have died during childbirth through a "Special Department," which is handled by officers at their discretion after careful investigation.

Fundraising Matters

The recent donation income of the cooperative has been significantly affected by the rising prices of goods. The future of over a thousand refugees per day is unimaginable. It is hoped that all sectors will actively donate funds. The cooperative invited enthusiastic people from the community to hold a subcommittee meeting at the Qingxin Girls' School yesterday to discuss fundraising matters. Over forty people attended. To draw attention to this active relief effort, the cooperative has printed concise leaflets. The front side has four photos representing the four types of refugees: "Elderly, Weak, Poor, and Sick."

### "Yellow Tiger" Roars Wildly, Surpassing the 13,000 Yuan Mark – The "White Tiger" Not to be Outdone…Following Closely Behind

One of the Most Spectacular Scenes of Price Increases

The changes in the gold market are becoming increasingly intense. After falling, prices suddenly rebounded and rose to an unprecedented high of 13,250 yuan yesterday, an increase of 1,350 yuan. This was one of the most spectacular scenes of price increases ever seen in the market. The mood of all parties turned from pessimistic to optimistic. Foreign exchange opened slightly lower in the morning, showing signs of fatigue. However, soon after, the Hong Kong and local Chinese banks and the Shanghai West Bank started to actively buy, and the price eventually reversed and rose by 870 yuan, with 2,500 taels traded. The morning opened 250 yuan lower due to competition among cash dealers. Heshun sold 50 taels to Decheng for 12,050 yuan. Yongcheng and Hesheng also competed to sell, and the price continued to fall by 150 yuan, retreating to 2,900 yuan. Decheng, Chengda, Mingfeng, Xianghe, Shunyuan, Xiangxing, and Yongjing bought, and Hesheng and Yongcheng also bought back, and the market price rose again by 600 yuan. Chengji bought 10 taels from Xianghe for 12,500 yuan, but Heshun, Tianyuan, and Defu sold, and Xianghe and Chengji sold again, suppressing the price to 350 yuan. Dafeng actively bought 70 taels, rising by 50 yuan. At noon, Jin Defu bought 20 taels. The market closed at 12,400 yuan. The afternoon opening was the same. Zhongxing, Xinyuan, Tianyuan, Fukang, Yong, Yongcheng, Dafeng, Hesheng, and Xinfeng Yong actively bought, soaring to 3,000 yuan. Hetae, Tongkang Yong, Xiangxing, and Yongtian sold at high prices, and the price was suppressed to 2,880 yuan. Dafeng, Fukang Yong, Yongcheng, Xianghe, and Dafeng actively bought again, and Shanghai West Bank absorbed. Both Heshun and Yongcheng bought, reaching an unprecedented high price of 13,250 yuan. Penda, Yongcheng, and Decheng sold, and the price immediately fell by 200 yuan. Dafeng raised the price to buy, rising to 3,180 yuan. Finally, a large jewelry store sold 10 taels. The market closed at 13,170 yuan at 4 p.m. The selling price of the gold store's own brand of gold bars was 13,300 yuan, 400 yuan lower than the buying price.

The October contract opened 20 yuan lower at 8,350 yuan. Later, the cash price rose, raising the price to 400 yuan, with buyers. The market closed at 410 yuan at noon. The afternoon opening was 10 yuan higher at 420 yuan. The closing price was 8,430 yuan, 60 yuan higher than the previous day, with a high-low spread of 80 yuan.

The selling price of silver jewelry per tael in jewelry stores: Datonghang and Xintonghang opened 20 yuan lower in the morning at 1,240 yuan. The price then rose to 1,280 yuan, but suddenly fell back to 1,260 yuan. At noon, it was 1,270 yuan. In the afternoon, the price was raised by 40, rising by 80 yuan to reach an unprecedented high price of 1,350 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 50 to 60 yuan, a net increase of 90 yuan.

There is Talk of Lifting the Ban on Yarn with Taxation

The atmosphere in the yarn market at the opening was quite weak. Due to the spread of numerous negative news, some speculators saw the possibility of a price limit down. Before the opening, about 50 bales were sold at a price of only 2,135 yuan. At this time, the shouting in the market was chaotic. The first price quoted was 2,165 yuan, 50 yuan lower than the previous day. The market was flat, and soon after, it fell to 155 yuan. Some short sellers came to cover their positions, and the price rebounded to 185 yuan, fluctuating between 70 and 80 yuan for quite a while. Unexpectedly, the prices of yarn and cloth in the second session of the exchange soared together, and the market sentiment suddenly turned enthusiastic. Those covering their short positions surged in like a tide. The market price rose from this point to 2,250 yuan, announcing a price limit up. The off-exchange price started at 265 yuan, then 55 yuan. The market was closed in the afternoon due to the price limit. The prices of yarn and cloth at the exchange also reached the price limit. The actual trading volume remained as quiet as ever, with only a slight embellishment from speculative buying and selling among peers. Prices followed the Shuangma yarn and rose. In half a month, factory orders for 15,000 bales were transacted, all of which were peer-to-peer transactions. Currently, the target of the yarn market is unanimously bullish. Because the price of gold is soaring, the enthusiasm of buyers has reached a boiling point. It is unknown to what extent the future will develop. However, prices have already entered a high range. The daily changes are still in a raging storm. In the afternoon, rumors spread in the market that the export of yarn and cloth would be banned. After all, they felt inconvenient. There is talk of lifting the ban on the 24th of this month, with a 15% tax on cotton yarn, or 150 yuan per 1,000 yuan. This still remains to be proven by the facts. Shenxin No. 9 Factory opened 1,550 bales at a price of 2,235 yuan.

Futures Yarn Also Follows the Price Limit Up

The futures of Jinbianma also created an unprecedented new high price. The news was moderate, and the market sentiment was optimistic. Bulls absorbed a large amount, and the market became tighter and tighter. Short sellers were eager to cover their positions, creating a huge upward surge. The morning opening was due to a drop in American cotton of 31 to 40 points, and the market sentiment was confused. Factory orders were slightly weak at the beginning, but large investors continued to actively buy, and the market atmosphere immediately rose. The opening price of futures yarn was also flat. The January contract has already started to appear. The November contract opened at 1,970 yuan, the December contract at 2,025 yuan, and the January contract at 2,055 yuan. After the opening, factory orders rose, and there was a sign of a price limit. Futures yarn took advantage and went up. In the afternoon, they continued their efforts. The cash yarn was price-limited and there was no market. The opening price of futures yarn for both near and far months also surged to the price limit, and the off-exchange price was also 250 yuan higher. Although the foundation for the upward trend is solid, new investors should still be cautious. The list is as follows:

The Cotton Market Has Entered a State of Inertia

Although the momentum of cotton is firm, the rising force has entered a state of inertia, because daily rises and price increases make it difficult for consumers to handle.

American species, Pengjiapo 100 pieces, 70.0 yuan

Also, 100 pieces, 725.0 yuan

The New York cotton market fell due to a large number of bull closings and southern farmers hedging, and also due to a lack of interest from general professionals, resulting in a continuous sharp decline. As a result, the closing price yesterday fell by 32 to 33 points.

The Indian cotton market was flat and weak. There were no large transactions in recent days. At the same time, it also fell slightly due to bull closings and retail sales. The closing price yesterday fell by about 2 to 3 rupees each.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trading market was quite stable and calm. In recent days, apart from a slight need from factories for raw cotton and coarse velvet, most are watching from the sidelines. Those holding the goods are not in a hurry to sell them easily, and those who want to buy are also unwilling to aggressively pursue them. As for direct hedging transactions, there has been little progress due to the fact that the required procedures have not yet been completed.

### Black Market Foreign Exchange Sought at High Prices, But No Buyers – All Foreign Currencies Still Rising

The foreign exchange market: the Central Bank and HSBC's quoted prices were flat. The counter prices of HSBC and other small banks were stagnant. In the black market for British and American exchange, there was activity among those willing to supply at higher prices, and the situation tended to harden. The rumors of the previous day were absolutely unfounded. Even importers who were not allowed to apply were unwilling to fish in troubled waters and absorb. Therefore, after the morning opening, an American telegraphic transfer of 3.25 yuan was entrusted to a broker to inquire and sell, but there were no buyers. A foreign trading company in Shanghai that hedges the exchange rate was willing to absorb only at 3.75 yuan. At noon, the price was about 3.375 yuan. There were still no transactions in the afternoon. The British exchange closed at 2 shillings 1.125 pence, flat. The average price of the American exchange was 3.375 yuan, a net increase of 1.25 yuan.

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw another surge. British and American gold pounds rose by 5 yuan each with the cash price. British and American currency notes also rose by 2 yuan. American gold notes rose again to 32.90 yuan, a net increase of 2.40 yuan from the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong notes was also high, and the market price rose by 10 cents. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes also tended to rise. The former rose to 3 yuan, and the latter rose to 2.30 yuan. In addition, currencies such as Singapore, Annam, Canadian, and Philippine notes also tended to rise.

### White Rice Leading White Rice – Rice Also Soars

Yesterday, the rising trend of foreign rice had subsided. The early market was even weaker, because the rumors between Japan and the United States had temporarily subsided. The Public Works Department was still approving small quantities of rice, approving more than 1,500 tons in two days, and the approved price was still 139.76 yuan, so the market sentiment turned bullish. There were profit-taking sales in the early market, and the market price had猛烈降落 by 4 to 5 yuan. Yinghua Company's Bai rice was reduced by 6.5 to 7 yuan from 169 yuan, and 현미 현미 was reduced by 38 to 39 yuan from 140 yuan. Lower-quality goods were even more slashed, selling for only 137 yuan. Other goods, such as No. 1 and No. 2 Western goods, also saw price reductions. No. 1 Western rice sold for only about 153 yuan, and No. 2 sold for 142 yuan. However, at that time, news of the continued rise in cotton yarn suddenly spread, causing a group of new hoarders to rekindle their enthusiasm and start to take action again. In an instant, the wind and waves changed, and the market became active again. Shouts were heard everywhere. Silver shops saw Fuzi brand rice return to 143 yuan, miscellaneous brands reaching 142 yuan, and stack rice reaching 141.5 yuan. Afterwards, buying and selling were intertwined, and the market trended sideways, with no further changes until the close. Compared with the closing price in the morning, the price was still slightly soft.

The total arrival of new and broken early japonica rice was about 300 dan yesterday. The market was strong. For example, early broken rice from Nangang opened at 161 yuan to 160 yuan, and high-quality new japonica rice from Kunshan opened at 160 yuan. The general market was 158 to 159 yuan. Qingjiao can rice and Fengjing Bai Rice were relatively flat due to their softer texture and similar supply and demand, continuing to be 159 yuan, and the second quality rice to 157.5 yuan.

The market for glutinous rice was still strong due to the low inventory, and the prices continued to rise. The high-quality glutinous rice from Hong Kong was 175 yuan, the general market was 173 yuan, and the second quality rice was 170 yuan. Glutinous tea was 162 yuan, an increase of 1 to 2 yuan each.

### The Rising Trend of Tapioca Flour Slightly Subsided

Yesterday, the price of tapioca flour was flat in the early market. Due to the easing of the situation and the subsidence of rumors, and the Public Works Department's public sale of flat flour was still in progress, the buying power of large investors outside the industry had decreased, and the actual sales were weak, and customer demand was also slack. However, the trading of peer-to-peer speculation continued unabated, so prices often had a difference of 3 to 5 cents to 1 yuan. As a result, the final price was about 50 cents lower than the previous market. The opening price of Pao Tai was 44.80 yuan, rising to 45.10 yuan, and the closing price was 44.60 yuan. Jinlong opened at 43.80 yuan, rising to 44.45 yuan, and closed at 43.67 yuan. The成交價仍有 4 to 50,000 bags. Wheat bran also saw profit-taking sales, and small bags were reduced to 42 yuan. Wheat owners were hoarding goods, and the inventory was low. It was still difficult to buy the factory's previous disc, and the goods still insisted on 70 yuan.

### Edible Oil Arrives One After Another, Manipulation Still Very Powerful

The source of edible oil is still arriving one after another. It has been found that the first batch of Dalian soybean oil and Qingdao raw oil sold by the oil office has arrived at 700 barrels each and has been distributed to the market. It is suspected that speculative merchants are still manipulating the market strongly, and the market price is still being raised high. Yesterday, the market price rose by another 2 to 3 yuan. A total of 27 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 10 barrels of soybean oil, 50 barrels of Dayun soybean oil, 20 barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil, 200 tins of Yantai raw oil, 30 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 20 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, 400 dan of Dayou Factory refined oil, 100 barrels of Japanese factory vegetable oil, and 200 dan of vegetable oil from Yoshida and Coating Factory were sold. (Price from the Market Report)

### Sugar Prices Continue to Soar

The sugar market yesterday still saw skyrocketing prices because the rumor of stopping foreign rises had not been eliminated and the source was feared to be difficult. Spot sugar still soared. Futures, such as the end of the month contract, were 230 yuan in the morning and 240 yuan in the afternoon. The November 10th contract was 232 yuan in the morning and 242 yuan in the afternoon. All were still limited to the price limit and there were no transactions. The guild shaved off the disc. Spot sugar, No. 24 crude white October import was 236 to 240 yuan in the morning, 244.5 to 250 yuan in the afternoon, up 15 yuan. The September price was 235 to 239 yuan, 242 to 248 yuan in the afternoon, up 14 yuan. August was 235 to 238.5 yuan, 240 to 246 yuan in the afternoon, up 13 yuan.

### The Bond Market Is Weak and Unable to Recover

The Public Bond Black Market: Yesterday morning's market was quite quiet. In the afternoon, there was another sharp decline. With various commodities such as yarn, cloth, and gold all soaring without limit, the market looked bad. In recent months, there have been too many bullish traders, but it just so happened that a large number of traders from the Sichuan gang emerged, causing the current cash flow to cause public bonds to be extremely congested in each stock. The sellers in the afternoon claimed that another Sichuan gang had entrusted others to sell, or that the financial community was releasing bonds, which is better called a floating bullish market. In fact, the environmental situation is no different from the past, and it may be a matter of self-disturbance for mediocre people. The money market is tighter, which is a fact, but there are also different degrees of tightness. In the morning, Hengkang sold a large amount, followed by Hongda, but Xie Kang, Yi Ji, and Yi Tai bought enthusiastically, so the noon closing market was fairly stable. In the afternoon, Xie Kang turned to sell, and Hengkang continued to sell. Run Yu, Datong, Jiufeng, Zhongfu, and Lianhe all had sales, although Renchang, Jiufu, Zhongyi Hu He, Fei and Wu He, etc. bought, but the supply and demand gap was too great. Grade C opened at 68.5 yuan and then fell straight to 77.5 yuan at the close. Grade C also broke the 80 yuan mark, Grade B also broke 70 yuan, Grade D broke into 60 yuan, and Grade E also retreated into 70 yuan. Only Grade A fell less. This type of decline came suddenly and was completely affected by the congestion of goods. It will not be easy to turn around in the short term. As a result, the market price uniformly fell sharply by 50 cents to 1.30 yuan. The成交價 was 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan.

### Zhejiang Military Instructor Training Class Solemnly Holds Opening Ceremony, Director of Education Xu Personally Delivers Training

(Lishui Correspondence) The Zhejiang Province Military Instructor Training Class held a review at the grand parade ground at 6:30 AM on the 11th. The trainees' movements were orderly and their spirits were high. After the review, the second-term opening ceremony and oath-taking ceremony were held in the forest meeting ground. Director Xu Shaodi, Deputy Director Zhou Boping, Construction Department Representative Shen Yun, County Party Department Representative Wang Jianming, Service Member Peng Xunqing, representatives from various institutions and organizations, all instructors, and all trainees attended. The meeting ground was decorated purely with natural materials to beautify Military life.

Director Xu reported the start of the ceremony, chaired by Director Xu, who led the proceedings as required and made a report. He briefly stated that today is the second term opening ceremony and oath-taking ceremony. There are several points to report to everyone: 1. The significance of holding this class: (1) The Military cause in this province has a good reputation in the country. This is due to the enthusiastic leadership of the provincial Party and government organs and the Provincial Military Council over the years, as well as the efforts of the service members of each group. Because Military education is a good method for cultivating youth, we have always emphasized teacher training, which has led to this achievement, and the cause has been able to advance rapidly, achieving remarkable results since the war. (2) Due to the development of the Military cause in this province, there is a deep lack of Military teachers since the war. The Provincial Party Department, the Education and Youth Department, and the Provincial Military Council are holding this class in March to cultivate excellent teachers to meet the needs of various school groups. (3) After the first term of trainees graduated, various school groups competed to hire them. Currently, various school groups still feel the lack of instructors and are recruiting instructors from this class. 2. Training guidelines: (1) Implement Military management and the mentor system. Military management is now implemented in various junior high schools and has been widely implemented. The original Military management method was first advocated and implemented in Zhejiang because it was indeed effective. It has been adopted and promulgated nationwide by the Ministry of Education. As for the mentor system, university and middle school departments implement it according to the Ministry's orders. Students are grouped and led by mentors for activities, including training in thought, speech, and behavior. This strict training is necessary for modern education. (2) Focus on cultivating good habits and a spirit of service. People in society today are mostly infected with bad habits, so the New Life Movement is advocated. In fact, the conditions of the New Life Movement are all present in Military training. As for cultivating a spirit of service, it is very important. The so-called purpose of life is to serve, to cultivate a spirit of helping others, loving the group, and cooperating, to serve society and the country. (3) Focus on spiritual training, life training, and production training. Spirit is more important than material, focusing will, concentrating power, loving the group, loving the country, and obeying the leader are most important. Acting quickly, moving quickly, being polite in advancing and retreating, and all reasonable training that meets the needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, especially labor production training, are training that meets the urgent needs of modern times. 3. Hopes for the future: (1) It is not easy for all trainees to come from various counties. In order to enrich themselves, they spare no time, energy, economy, and job, and voluntarily accept training, which is very admirable. It is hoped that in the future, they will humbly accept various trainings and study hard, and there will be great gains when the term expires. (2) Furthermore, from today's oath, they must be determined to serve the Military cause for life, work together, and achieve the training goals. (3) It is not easy to handle things in this difficult period. The Provincial Military Council is not afraid of difficulties and is holding this class. It is hoped that everyone will appreciate this intention and work together. This class is sponsored by the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Department of Education, and the Provincial Military Council. I am a member of the Provincial Party Department, the Director of the Department of Education, and the Standing Director of the Provincial Council. I am very concerned about all the facilities in the class. Finally, I hope that everyone will have a firm will, a kind attitude, a lively spirit, and be as eager to learn and study hard as the first term, and achieve satisfactory results in the future. After the report, all the trainees took the oath. Director Xu and Deputy Director Zhou presided over the oath-taking. Certifiers Shen Yun, Wang Jianming, Peng Xunqing, etc. successively gave earnest encouragement. The representative of the oath-takers answered, and finally sang the Military song. The ceremony was completed with cheers and music.

### Hong Kong Football League Opens, South China Suffers Defeat in First Game, Kwong Wah Wins 2-0

(Hong Kong Correspondence) This year's Hong Kong League football competition kicked off the day before yesterday (September 27). The Chinese powerhouse Eastern and Sing Tao teams defeated Middlesbrough and the Engineering Team respectively in the first division. In the other two games, St. Joseph's defeated the Police, and Hong Kong defeated Kowloon. Yesterday (September 28), there were two first-division games. Upper Kellett defeated the Navy, and South China clashed with Kwong Wah. The former game was played at So Kon Po, and Upper Kellett won a big victory by six to zero. In the latter game, the two teams met at Caroline Hill, attracting thousands of fans to watch the South Kwong War. It turns out that South China and Kwong Wah are brothers, and for several years each has been the common master. South China, the elder brother, was one step ahead, so the younger brother had lofty ambitions but was unable to achieve them. This time, South China's midfielders Li Kwok-wai and forward Chen Dehui defected to Kwong Wah's banner. The younger brother gained this fresh force and actually made a name for himself, defeating the elder brother by six to zero, creating a miraculous continuation in the history of the club. Kwong Wah led 1-0 in the first half and scored another goal in the second half. Li Qiu Wang was also at a loss. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Spring and Autumn

### Keep to the Left

— Ping Ye

The phrase "keep to the left" still needs to be repeated in the international city of Shanghai today. If this is not my superfluous remark, then it is a shameful display of indiscipline by most people in Shanghai.

Every road, every street, is shoulder-to-shoulder, with noisy voices and a row of slow walkers. People meet on the street and chat in the middle of the road, holding hands, holding waists, and putting arms around shoulders. In various forms, almost every sidewalk, even the road, should be left to "walk alone" to be worthy of being a "citizen of Shanghai today."

Cars and rickshaws have traffic rules, but there are many quieter places where various vehicles are at will. Of course, the car is still driven by people, so they cannot avoid being vulgar!

Several prosperous roads with many shops also have several stores that treat the road in front of them as private property, hanging various cloth and wooden signs on it, causing the public to walk with their heads down, and placing cargo boxes, ropes, and even chairs in front of them, causing the public to detour. We are just giving examples of these things.

Everyone hopes to be a good citizen who obeys order and morality, but even these common senses of keeping to the left are not easy to do. This is truly a shame for Shanghai's civilization. We hope that some people who strictly keep to the left at ordinary times will adhere to this line of discipline. We hope that people who read newspapers will also earnestly practice keeping to the left. Of course, we also hope that the responsible authorities who maintain order can also pay attention to this. If the public can truly do this simple request to bring up the old matter again, then this will not be a trivial matter.

Keep to the left! Safety first!

### Avoid Paying Handling Fees

— Yin

People who have not encountered their electricity being cut off for not paying their electricity bills on time probably do not pay much attention to the fact that they have to pay a "connection fee" to reconnect the electricity. Because they often forget to pay the bill within the specified date, or do not receive the bill or notice, and do not think of asking the company, the power company will cut off the electricity. Therefore, the extra loss - the connection fee - must be paid. That handling fee is 2.8 yuan in legal tender, and the users in West Shanghai are 3 yuan in legal tender.

Although electricity prices have been repeatedly increased in the past few months, they have not been increased to the above-mentioned handling fee, but this month it is also "treated equally," that is, an increase of 200%. In other words, 2.8 yuan becomes 8.4 yuan, and West Shanghai becomes 9 yuan. Wouldn't it be unjust for those who are punished?

Therefore, I specifically wrote this article, hoping that electricity users in the Public Concession and West Shanghai will pay attention to the following points:

(1) Pay the bill immediately as far as possible after receiving the bill, and delay it for a maximum of two weeks. Do not wait for the reminder letter to pay, because sometimes the reminder letter may be lost. (2) If you have not received the bill three or four days after the meter reader "visits," you should ask by phone or go to the company in person to inquire. Because the telephone bill and the fare will not exceed 9 yuan in legal tender! So it must be a worthwhile

(3) If you are short of money and cannot pay the bill for a while, then you have to go to the company in person to request an extension: but you must have a very sufficient deposit, otherwise, don't bother to ask.

(4) If the deposit is not enough, it must be increased. If the user does not pay it in within the specified period, the electricity may also be cut off, so this point must also be noted.

I hope that electricity users in the Public Concession should keep this in mind from now on, so as to avoid this kind of loss and the trouble after the power outage. Then, no matter how much the power company adds to it, it doesn't matter.

Editor's note: Since the company authorities have a procedure for sending bills by mail every month, they should try to avoid delaying the copying and sending. It would be best if the payment deadline could be extended a few days, which would be very convenient for users.

### Grand Occasion of Lang Yuxiu's Concert, Audience Was Extremely Excited, Huang Xuanweng Wrote a Poem to Praise

— Yong

Lang Yuxiu's concert was held on the 17th night at the Lyceum Theater, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. The grand occasion at that time was unprecedented in all concerts. There were more than a hundred people who sent flower baskets. The accompanying violin and piano were extremely exquisite and complemented each other: the violin player was Mr. Xu William, who had studied in Belgium; the piano player was Ms. Li Huifang, both of whom are famous figures in the Shanghai music scene. The famous poet Huang Xuanweng composed a long poem after listening to the songs to praise Ms. Yuxiu's singing. The lyrics are as follows:

I heard that the lady returned from overseas, winning the title of singer and glorifying the country. The lady's singing is unparalleled, ranking first among hundreds of people. I saw the lady in the drawing room, talented father and talented daughter shining together, the father is good at photography and wonderful creation, and the daughter is unique and called the queen of singing. Only now have I heard the music of heaven, one song is as precious as a peck of pearls, at first the delicate sound is still low, stuttering and chirping, it takes some thinking to appreciate it, gradually like a warbler singing a hundred times, gently towards people in the wind. It is also like the sheng and reed instruments resounding from the sky, the strong wind blows down, the sections can be pressed, sometimes intermittent and difficult to hear, until the end it is still consistent; sometimes it is very similar to the words in a boudoir, whispering only to you, the universe is lonely and pure, the ancient Yao love is unknown. Finally, like beads rolling on a jade plate, a thousand twists and turns break the heart, piercing through clouds and cracking rocks, the lingering sound lingers, winning the gaze of ten thousand eyes on the Yao Terrace, seeing that it is not the appearance of the human world, the instrument is like a bear facing all directions, stepping lightly like a fairy, the flowers on the head are just beginning to bloom, wonderful, don't you see the vast sea with the moon in the sky, you can still hear the fairy music and singing.

### Small Statistics

— Shen Yanling

Raising a cat, eating two meals a day, cat fish costs one dime a day, and two bowls of rice, each bowl costing one dime, then it costs nine yuan a month. A catered meal before the war was only eight yuan a month. Raising a cat now is equivalent to raising a person before the war.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fourteen: A Hero's Life

More than ten years ago, Begonia came to Shanghai for the last time, and the old gentleman asked many people to introduce him, insisting on asking Begonia to be his teacher; but when Begonia saw that he was such a big piece of material, he refused to accept it, only agreeing to be a friend and give him pointers from time to time. But even so, this Mr. Hou was already very satisfied; when he met someone, he always twisted his round neck, raised his thumb, and said with a smile that his eyes were gone: "My tune was taught by Begonia!"

Therefore, when Begonia was in a desperate situation, he thought of him third. Unexpectedly, after going to three pawnshops, he finally found him, but this gentleman immediately pointed to a photo of Cheng Yanqiu hanging on the wall and said:

"I have now changed to learning the Cheng tune, let's talk about it another day when we have time!"

It was not until Begonia got up to say goodbye with drooping head and dejected expression that he reluctantly handed over two ten-dollar bills. (242)

### Mourning Dr. Shen Shiyi

— Isolated

The other day, when I opened the Shen Bao, I saw the obituary of Dr. Shen Shiyi, and I was suddenly stunned. Mr. Shen was one of my respected friends. I didn't expect that after being separated for three years, we would be separated forever. Recalling the past, I wanted to cry but had no tears.

Mr. Shen's name is Gongchi, and his pen name is Wutang. He used to write drama reviews for the art world of this newspaper. His thoughts were sharp and his arguments were thorough. He founded the "Guessing Riddles Semimonthly" in his spare time from his diagnosis and treatment, and produced many works, which were deeply welcomed by readers. At that time, I also wrote for the publication, so we were very close, so I knew that Mr. Shen was not only good at Bian Que's art, but also had a certain attainment in literature and art. His thinking skills were quite original. He seemed to have a special interest in Ping opera. I listened to his singing several times, and I felt that his pronunciation and singing were accurate and free.

Recalling that before Mr. Shen went to the rear to serve, I once told him: "Today, free China needs medical talents very urgently. Why do you stay on the isolated island with the art of life and death? Is the life of the islanders more precious than the life of the soldiers who are charging into battle to protect the country?" Mr. Shen told me that it was not that he was unwilling to go to the mainland to serve, but that he could not rashly go alone before the organization was perfect and the methods were decided. I was relieved, and later I heard that Mr. Shen was about to leave, so we held a farewell banquet. Many people came that day, and Mr. Shen stood up and gave a speech, unable to bear to leave. We also cheered loudly to wish for the early arrival of victory. Afterwards, Mr. Shen turned to the mainland to carry out his sacred work. It has been three years since then, and there has been no news. I was looking forward to meeting again when he returned and reuniting the old friendship. Unexpectedly, he has now sacrificed himself for the country. I am still wandering on the isolated island, floating and sinking with the world. I am of no help to the country and no benefit to the people. Looking up at my old friend, I feel even more ashamed.

Interview with Artists

### Tianfeng's Mainstay, Qiu Quan

— Wei Ren

Qiu Quan, formerly an actor of the "China Travel," is now the mainstay of "Tianfeng." He has been to many places, acted in many plays, has a profound and thorough understanding of drama theory, and has a highly skilled villainous acting style. In today's drama circle, he is a rising star and a rare talent.

He is twenty-four years old this year, a native of Nanjing. Both his parents are dead, and there is only one brother at home. He studied at Nanjing Municipal No. 1 Middle School, Jinling Middle School, and Suzhou Industrial College's Civil Engineering Department. He liked drama very much as a student. He was best at drawing among many subjects, so he now has a good understanding of makeup.

His drama work began at the age of seven or eight. He first joined the China Drama Society hosted by Cao Yu, Ma Yanxiang, Dai Ya and others as a student. After graduation, he joined the Jin Middle School Drama Club and performed "Our Hometown" and "Alarm," revealing his talent for acting for the first time, and was unanimously praised by the community. After August 13, he left Nanjing and joined the National Salvation Troupe, going to Hankou, Sichuan, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and other places to perform. Soon after, he came to Shanghai and made a guest appearance in the Green Field Theater Company's "Executioner," "Di Si Niang," and "People Who Enjoy Themselves," and also performed "Dinner" in the Shanghai Middle School Students' United Drama Troupe. From this time on, Qiu Quan's acting skills slowly left a deep impression in the minds of Shanghai audiences.

After that, he joined "China Travel." He played in Cao Yu's trilogy—"Sunrise," "Thunderstorm," and "Wilderness," and also played in "Resurrection," "Li Xiangjun," "Hua Mulan," etc. Most of the roles he plays are villains. He played Pan Yueting in "Sunrise" very successfully. However, he can also play the righteous roles, such as Lu Dahai in "Thunderstorm." Every move shows the simple and straightforward nature of a fool. It is indeed rare and valuable.

After withdrawing from "China Travel," he was recruited by "Tianfeng" and played in the plays: "The Female Shop Owner," "Life Is Like a Dream," "Crossroads," "Enmity and Hatred," "Grievances in the Qing Palace," "The Gold Rush," etc.

Recently, he directed Wu Bolao's "Love." He has worked hard to study the individuality of the actors, the change of the atmosphere of the stage, as well as the position, small movements, etc. He is not proud, not satisfied, and has the same spirit of burying his head and working hard that Luo Ming should have in pursuing profound art. Naturally, a bright and broad road is being laid in front of him!

What the reporter hopes for Qiu Quan is: to always maintain a humble attitude of learning, and to always remember the mission on his shoulders! - This is the worker who is truly promoting the drama movement that we need most urgently!

### Random Notes on the Pear Garden

— Cun Ren

Wu Sheng Yang Shengchun is Mei Lanfang's cousin. This time, he performed at sea with the Tan Troupe and won a good reputation. He specifically went to Mei Lanfang's residence to greet her yesterday afternoon. It is said that once the term expires, he will independently transfer to a new one. One

Jia Bi Yun, who died of a stroke while watching dog racing in Yi Garden, has been in the Common Stage for two years since her beloved daughter Jia Xiaoyun entered from Tianchan. Since her father passed away, she must burn incense piously in front of Bi Yun's portrait to commemorate him when she returns home after the play. Those who know him deeply appreciate Xiaoyun's filial piety.

Da Wutai and Jin Shaoshan will sing in Shanghai next month. It is learned that the station will send someone north to greet him after Jin replies by telegram. I have decided to give up inviting him.

Tianchan continues to rehearse the new play "Guanyin." When it is publicly performed, Wu Sheng Xiaoxiaohuo's Niu Fugui will be allowed to join the stage.

### Blood Rain in the Jade Garden

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 18: Vowing to Sweep Away the Xiongnu Regardless of Personal Safety

Liu Zongmin said, "Don't bother with those useless government troops from just now. We should only focus on chasing ahead. We can fight when we catch up with their main force." But the sound of signal cannons rang out all around, and scouts reported that officers had broken out of the woods behind them, cutting their own troops into two sections. Not knowing exactly how many government troops there were, the rebel bandits were immediately thrown into chaos. At this time, Liu Zongmin felt a slight sense of panic and turned his horse back to help. He saw government army flags in the east, south, and north, and the sounds of killing filled the air. His own men had already been cut to pieces, each looking after themselves, which made the situation even more chaotic. So he brandished his saber and spurred his horse, commanding the rebel bandits to quickly push back the government troops and form a unified line. After a while, he saw a detachment of government troops charging towards them, led by a general whose saber flashed brilliantly, scattering all before him. The rebel bandits retreated one after another, and in an instant, he had charged right in front of him. A burly man with a curly beard sat on a black horse, wearing plain armor and a white robe, with a majestic appearance and a tall stature. Behind him was a white banner embroidered with a black "Zhang" character; it was Zhang Cangqiu. He glared with his strange eyes and scolded Liu Zongmin, "You traitor, you harm my country and trample on my imperial capital. I, surnamed Zhang, will not spare you! First, take my blade as revenge for my sovereign and father!" Liu Zongmin was also enraged and shouted, "A petty officer like you, how could I fear you?" He slashed his great saber at Zhang Cangqiu's head. Zhang Cangqiu brandished his saber to block it. The two used all their skill and fought fiercely. Two sabers danced in the clouds and mist, turning into two white rays, shuttling back and forth. They fought for more than seventy exchanges, neither gaining the upper hand. Just then, Chen Fei arrived on horseback, wielding a horizontal hammer. (198)
