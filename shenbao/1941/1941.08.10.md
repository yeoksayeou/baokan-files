### Major Democratic Nations of England and America to Adopt Joint Strong Action, Cannot Stand Idly By Regarding Japan's Southern Advance or Northern Attack, and Recognize the Soviet Union as a Bulwark Against Germany

Reuters, London, 9th Dispatch: Observers here stated yesterday that current discussions between England and America may result in a united and powerful warning to Japan from various strong nations. The extent to which this warning is issued or not made explicit will depend on future developments. However, it seems very clear that this warning is not an empty threat. Such a warning may include: (1) Democratic nations increasing practical assistance to the Soviet Union; (2) England and America strengthening defenses in the Western Pacific; (3) Eliminating Japan's existing doubts about England, America, and Australia considering the integrity of the Dutch East Indies extremely important to their security; (4) England and America taking action to demonstrate that they cannot stand idly by regarding Japan's attack on the Soviet Union. The final decision of the democratic nations regarding the attitude towards Thailand will be clarified after the conclusion of the talks between England and America. According to reports, Japan has already established a strong base on the border between Vietnam and Thailand. Apparently, England considers Japan's actions to undermine Thailand's independence as a most serious development. However, how England will respond to this challenge will largely depend on America's actions. Observers here believe that the U.S. Constitution does not allow President Roosevelt to make threats of war before Japan takes any action in Thailand or the Dutch East Indies. If Japan disregards the warnings of the democratic nations and controls Thailand, England and America will at least impose absolute restrictions on Japan within the non-warfare scope. At that time, Japan's second aggression will automatically become a war. However, observers solemnly point out that this is Japan's perspective. It is believed that from next week onwards, Japan will no longer have the possibility of doubting the determination of the democratic nations. It is also believed that the democratic nations will make it clear in some form that even if Japan declares that it will no longer advance south, it will not be able to "buy back" England and America's view that Japan threatens the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is considered a defensive bulwark against Germany. However, it is doubtful whether the United States will allow Japan to prevent the transport of American goods to the Soviet Union. Observers believe that there is no doubt about the common determination of the United States and England to ensure the security of Singapore.

### Canada Takes Precautions Along the Pacific Coast

Reuters, Ottawa, 9th Dispatch: Canadian Minister of National Defence Ralston stated last night that Canada, in view of the situation in the Far East, has taken all necessary precautions along the Pacific coast. The 6th Division of the Canadian active army is currently being mobilized.

Reuters, Ottawa, 9th Dispatch: Minister of National Defence Ralston stated that the new Canadian army will be allocated to locations on various battlefields that require reinforcements.

Reuters, Melbourne, 9th Dispatch: Minister of Aviation McEwen stated yesterday that the Imperial Far East Air Force, including Australian Air Force units in Malaya, is powerful enough to cope with any war crisis in the region. He also said that significant progress has been made in strengthening the strength of the Imperial Air Force in Malaya. He stated that the government has further ordered aircraft for transporting large armies for the use of the Royal Australian Air Force, but can transport other troops if necessary.

Reuters, Singapore, 9th Dispatch: Opposition newspapers also demanded yesterday that England and America should express a stronger attitude towards Japan and advised Japan to act cautiously. The Straits Times stated that England and America should quickly announce their willingness to immediately assist Thailand. If England and America clearly express their willingness to go to war with Japan, war in the Pacific can be avoided. The Singapore Daily News, which is run by the Japanese and serves as the mouthpiece of the Japanese authorities, stated that if Japan wants to advance southward through Burma or Thailand, it is simply crazy. Burma can independently cope with the current Japanese military threat in Vietnam with plenty to spare. Thailand resists Japan's southward advance. In this situation, if Japan attempts to act rashly, it cannot be considered crazy. It is thought that not all Japanese are so foolish. If Japan's activities are limited to within China and Vietnam, England and America will not take military action against it.

### Defensive Preparations in Burma are Thorough, the Army is on Standby

Reuters, Yangon, 9th Dispatch: A group of journalists visited a certain area near Yangon. All those who knew the situation in Yangon an hour ago were deeply moved. The allocation of all Burmese military forces and equipment, and the continuous arrival of the latest equipment, now only allow one to know a little about the overall situation. Burma's defense preparations have never been announced, but today a spokesperson has assured that the Burmese military is now on standby to fulfill its responsibilities. Burma's defense thoroughness is no less than that of other parts of the Imperial Far East.

### Talks Between American and British Leaders Have Not Yet Officially Begun, American Officials Continue to Leave Washington, Rumor Has It That Stalin Will Also Participate

Reuters, Washington, 9th Dispatch: A telegram from the US President's yacht stated that the President is currently sailing safely at sea and spent all day on Friday reviewing official documents. The yacht and escort ship, the River Sioux, recently approached the coast to load fuel, fresh water, and food. The whereabouts of the yacht were not mentioned.

Reuters, Washington, 9th Dispatch: Amidst rumors of a meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, two senior government officials left here again yesterday. It has been confirmed that the most recent departures were Under Secretary of State Welles and General Piers, an assistant to Hopkins. According to the State Department, Welles' departure is for a "short vacation," and no further details were given. The whereabouts of General Piers have not yet been reported. His friends are all very "surprised" by Piers' trip.

Havas, Budapest, 8th Dispatch: The "Hungarian Newspaper" reported that the US President and the British Prime Minister will meet somewhere, and because Stalin will also participate, it is extremely secret.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 9th Dispatch: A London correspondent for the Nihde Newspaper reported yesterday that the talks between England and America are not specifically related to any one event, but are a general discussion. In addition to issues related to the transport of American goods to England, the German-Soviet war is also the focus of the talks. London believes that British and Soviet navies may cooperate to protect the transport of British and American aid to the Soviet Union. London military experts further pointed out that Germany may attack British interests in the Near East from Ukraine, and Egypt will also become a target of its attacks. Therefore, it is planned to explain British interests in Iran and Egypt. French-German relations are also one of the centers of discussion, but the most important point, at least on the British side, will focus on the Far East issue. Britain has made it clear that Japan's acquisition of a foothold in Thailand is a direct threat to British interests and that Britain must take the necessary measures. The correspondent concluded that as a result of this meeting, England and America may announce a common policy.

### Japan Also Denies Making Demands on the Soviet Union

International, London, 9th Dispatch: This question was still firmly believed yesterday that Japan had formally or semi-officially made demands to the Soviet Union, but Japan rejected this news as "pure fabrication." The London Daily Mail reported that the day's demands included the following: (1) Demilitarization of the Vladivostok area; (2) Establishing a garrison area on the Soviet "Manchurian" border; (3) The Soviet Union permitting Japan to have economic rights in Siberia; (4) Not transferring any strategically important bases to the United States.

Reuters, Rome, 8th Dispatch: The Roman People's Newspaper stated that if the news that Japan has made a request to the Soviet Union is true, then Japan directly does not want to allow the United States to supply the Soviet Union through Vladivostok.

Havas, Moscow, 8th Dispatch: Official circles here have denied rumors that Japan has made a number of conditions to the Soviet government.

### Mass Declares in Honolulu That the U.S. Navy is Powerful, The Capital of Any Country Endangering U.S. Policy Can Be Reduced to Rubble Overnight

Reuters, Honolulu, 9th Dispatch: Republican Congressman Maas of Minnesota told reporters yesterday that the U.S. Navy is powerful enough to "reduce the capital of any country that endangers our national policy to rubble overnight." Although Maas did not directly mention the location, it clearly referred to Tokyo. He recently completed six weeks of active duty in the Navy, during which he served as a Marine Corps colonel. He stated that the U.S. Navy is the most powerful in the world and believes that the U.S. Navy can promote any policy decided by the government. Referring to his previous speech at the Rotary Club, in which he said that no navy in the world could speak of long-term war preparation, he said, "Anyone who thinks that we are not prepared and takes a gamble will have to regret it." He also said that the naval and air personnel of any country in the world cannot compare with those of the United States, and there will be considerable progress in the future. He continued as a congressman, predicting that the day is coming when the United States will build as many as 50 aircraft carriers. He also said that he would recommend a major increase in Hawaii's defenses and would fight again for the fortification of Guam. His first step will be to recommend the opening of large-scale landing sites in the Hawaiian area. He also said that in a short period of time, there has been amazing progress in Midway Island, Wake Island, and Strong Island. He learned of this situation during his recent visits to these areas.

Editorial

### Prospects for the Overall Situation in the Far East

After repeatedly eroding Vietnam, Japan has mobilized a large army and headed to the Northeast, waiting for an opportunity to move. On the other hand, it has stationed troops on the border of Thailand, demanding "cooperation." On the democratic nations' side, in addition to England and America sending parallel notes to Thailand, stating their willingness to provide support, and China strengthening its Southwest defenses to prepare for any eventuality, President Roosevelt suddenly met with Prime Minister Churchill at this time to discuss the overall situation in the Far East, and it is rumored that Stalin and Special Envoy Hopkins, who had just returned from the Soviet Union, also participated in the event. All of this proves that both the aggressors and the anti-aggression front in the Far East have been swift in preparing to carry out a "showdown" in the near future. On the eve of this approaching storm, although the world has full confidence that "the light is not far away," it must face all the events that may be encountered with the greatest courage.

Under the intensified economic blockade by England and America, Japan is clearly in a difficult situation. Retreating would damage its "prestige" and even shake its "national foundation." In the future, it will have to risk "breaking out." Recently, Tokyo newspapers and Ishii and others have repeatedly used the encirclement of China, England, America, and the Netherlands as a pretext. This is the preparation work by the Japanese authorities to stimulate the people before taking action. But according to the actual situation, if Japan invades Thailand, China, England, and Burma will be the first to bear the brunt. For the sake of self-defense, they will inevitably launch a joint and active confrontation. At the same time, the United States has previously launched a freeze on funds and a ban on oil shipments to Japan due to the Vietnam issue. In the future, it will inevitably implement more severe sanctions against Japan due to the occupation of Thailand, so as to echo the military actions of China, England, and Burma. As a result, a major war will inevitably break out immediately in the South Pacific. At that time, the involvement of the Dutch East Indies, Australia, the Philippines, and even the United States in the vortex is only a matter of time. Considering that the united front of various democratic countries in the Far East has been deployed for years and has already taken shape, the world cannot help but ask how much real strength Japan still has militarily to dare to confront this united front with infinite reinforcements, and even more to ask how many days can Japan support the economic blockade war launched by England and America? Assuming that Japan occupies Thailand and can conquer Singapore in one fell swoop and spy on the Dutch East Indies, the South Pacific will certainly evolve into a situation where Japan dominates. If not, Japan will inevitably be defeated, without a doubt.

Japan may "attack the north after feigning the south," superficially oppressing Thailand and making a posture of resolutely advancing south, so as to divert the attention of England and America, but in reality, it is waiting for the "opportune moment" in the German-Soviet war to stab the Soviet Union in the back—Vladivostok. The advantage of this move is that the dangers that may be encountered are not as great as advancing south, and from a strategic point of view, it may eliminate the greatest threat to the Japanese mainland, because if the Far East Red Army takes Vladivostok as a base and sends aircraft to bomb North Manchuria, Korea, and the Japanese mainland, it will be as easy as turning one's hand. In the future, if the United States and the Soviet Union really cooperate in the Far East, the pressure they can exert on Japan will be far greater than that of Singapore or Manila; therefore, for economic interests, Japan naturally considers the possible gains from advancing south to be great, but if considering national defense security, the need for advancing north is obviously more urgent, but the huge strength of the Far East Red Army is not as easy to deal with as Japan's general northern advance faction imagines. What's more, according to yesterday's Reuters report, England and America are likely to strengthen their defenses in the Western Pacific on the one hand, and warn Japan with practical actions on the other, making it clear that England and America cannot sit idly by while it invades the Soviet Union. It can be seen that even if Japan acts foolishly in this regard, it is difficult to have a chance to succeed.

In short, it is a very obvious fact that Japan, which is now completely isolated economically and diplomatically, has reached the final stage where it must take risky actions; but according to the above, whether it advances south or north, it is not only difficult to imagine "smooth sailing," but it is feared that the road will be full of thorns; however, even if there are many difficulties, Konoe, who has formed the third cabinet, is already in the embarrassing situation of "it is difficult to stay if there are no more achievements," and in fact there must be a day when he has no time to choose and takes risks. Therefore, the democratic front must sharpen its swords and be prepared to deal with all possible developments. The best thing, of course, is to seize the opportunity first. If this is not possible, at least in terms of defensive strategy, it must be placed in a tight and seamless position. The first thing that should be firmly established is full cooperation between China, England, America, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands, and responding to all events with united action. Specifically, if Japan moves against Thailand first, China and England should immediately fight back. At the same time, the Far East Red Army must exert its restraining power in the north, while the United States, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the British dominions should strengthen their blockade against Japan and step up assistance to China and the Soviet Union to help them complete the final blow against Japan. The confirmation and preparation of this joint action should undoubtedly be the top priority of the governments of various democratic countries today.

### A Large Number of Japanese Aircraft Raided Chongqing Again Yesterday in Separate Batches, Dropped Many Bombs in the Mountains in the Western Suburbs, Did Not Hit Any Military Targets

Chongqing Military News, (1) The Japanese army surrounded by the Chinese army in Yangjiawan, Huangjiachang, Guojiachong, Changjiacen and other places has been largely wiped out after being severely attacked by the Chinese army for days. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to mop up and has now cleared the Japanese army in the Guanzhuangchang area. (2) After defeating the Japanese army that violated Xujiahe and other places north of Yichang, the Chinese army continued to capture Longwangdong Xiaojiagang on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese army collapsed and retreated, and the Chinese army tracked down and chased after them, reaching the west bank of Wuduhu. The Japanese army scrambled to cross the river, but was killed and drowned due to the flash flood. No less than 300 people. In the Caojia area, the Japanese army was also wiped out by the Chinese army a lot. (August 8th telegram)

Enshi (1) After the Chinese army outside Yichang recovered Jujiagou and Shibanwan, they continued to occupy Longwangdong on the 7th. The Japanese army was unable to support and retreated towards Xiaoxita. The Chinese army tracked down and chased after them. When the Japanese army retreated to the Huangbai River in Xiaoxita, it was just when the river was flooded, and the situation was extremely turbulent. The Japanese army wanted to make a final struggle against the water, but after being gradually pressed by the Chinese army to the river bank, the Japanese army was forced to fall into the water and flowed away with the waves. The rest were completely killed by the Chinese army. (2) On the morning of the 7th, more than 400 Japanese troops on the west bank of Yichang took dozens of wooden boats and proceeded to the urban area of Yichang. After being discovered by the Chinese artillery, they aimed at the Japanese boats and bombarded them. In just a few minutes, dozens of Japanese boats were all hit and overturned by the Chinese artillery fire, and no Japanese troops were spared. (3) More than 1,000 Japanese troops who advanced towards Haoqian were broken and defeated by the Chinese army on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese army retreated to Cenhekou and suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army obtained a lot of military supplies and is now continuing to pursue them. (July 7 telegram)

Representatives of various branches of the Industrial Cooperative Association gathered in the capital to hold a meeting, chaired by American chief consultant Fei Wusheng. According to the initial stage of the Industrial Cooperative Movement, the scale was small. Now it has grown rapidly, with 45,000 employees, divided into 700 cooperative cell organizations, with an annual production value of more than 20 million yuan. (August 8 Havas News Agency)

Chongqing The local news was obtained last night that the Japanese side has identified the establishment of a military agreement between China and Britain. This news was caused by China's deployment of defenses in the Yunnan-Guangxi border area since the Japanese army occupied Vietnam. China recognizes that Japan's occupation of Vietnam is a threat to the southwestern provinces of China. Therefore, senior military officials are stationed in Yunnan to monitor the deployment of national defense. It is heard that the central government and the Yunnan provincial authorities have a complete understanding of the defense. (Reuters, 9th)

Chongqing For nearly eight days, the Japanese planes have not come to bomb due to the bad weather here. Unexpectedly, after the weather improved yesterday, it suffered five raids in 24 hours. More than 100 Japanese planes bombed the western suburbs, the north bank of Jialing, and the south bank of the Yangtze River yesterday afternoon. At night, they carried out a night attack under the bright sunlight. Just after midnight, seven Japanese planes dropped bombs near Ximen. Today, 27 Japanese planes bombed the western suburbs. Two hours later, 18 planes came again to drop bombs there. At noon today, 27 Japanese planes bombed the mountains in the western suburbs. Many bombs fell in the area where the British ambassador's residence is located. It is said that two unfinished air-raid shelters were directly hit yesterday afternoon, causing partial collapse and causing several deaths. Several bombs fell on a certain ferry on the south bank of the Yangtze River. The Japanese planes continued to bomb, but did not hit military targets, but made the residents trapped in the air-raid shelters day and night. (Reuters, 9th)

Chongqing Chongqing was attacked by 220 Japanese bombers five times in 24 hours. The last time was at 3:30 pm today. Chongqing suffered no less than three attacks today. Although the number of Japanese aircraft participating in each attack was large, the damage suffered by the city was small. The area around the Press Club was heavily attacked. This attack Japanese aircraft have obviously used new tactics to avoid intensive anti-aircraft fire. Each time they bombed, the Japanese aircraft were divided into several groups and flew into Chongqing from three or four different directions to drop bombs on the city. This method is obviously intended to confuse the anti-aircraft gunners. These anti-aircraft gunners have gradually become good at using their anti-aircraft guns, and the network of fire they emit is more dense than before. Few residents here sleep because they enter the air-raid shelter at 12:10 in the morning and only three planes fly over the city until 4 o'clock, obviously with the intention of harassing. When the first attack of the day began at 7:30 am, residents had to escape again, so there was not much time to sleep in bed. The last air raid alarm of the day was issued at 3:20 pm. (Reuters, 9th)

Reuters, Bangkok, 9th Dispatch: Today, a statement was issued here saying that if Thai troops are required to fight to implement Thailand's policy of defending neutrality and befriending all parties, they will not be afraid of war and will maintain the traditional prestige of the Thai army and fight to the end. The official document denies that any country has demanded bases from Thailand or threatened it, and stresses that Thailand is not disturbed by the movement of troops outside its borders, and reiterates that it does not consider aggression to be a concern.

Reuters, Saigon, 9th Dispatch: It is reported that two-thirds of the Japanese troops have arrived here, and the rest are scheduled to come here within a week. The Japanese side is now planning to establish a permanent landing base in Saigon.

### Japan-Thailand Situation: No Improvement; Eastern Report Claims Britain Pressing Thailand to Sign Defense Agreement

Reuters, Bangkok, 9th: Diplomatic sources here believe that the Japan-Thailand situation has not improved much in the past few hours. They say that Eden and Hull's remarks have excited the Thai people, but the atmosphere is still uncertain. If the slight progress currently present in the situation can be maintained, then it may be hoped that the current Thai trend will subside in the same way as the previous trend in the Dutch East Indies. However, the Thai trend is not entirely the same as the Dutch East Indies trend.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The Asahi Shimbun received a report yesterday from a correspondent in Bangkok, stating that they learned from reliable political figures that Britain has suggested to Thailand that they sign a defense agreement and establish military bases within Thai territory. Britain also intends to return to Thailand the land that previously belonged to Thailand but has now been incorporated into the territories of Burma and the Malay Peninsula. If the Thai people reject this request, all of Thailand's funds in Britain and the United States, amounting to 200,000,000 Thai baht, will be frozen. The correspondent described the circumstances under which this request was made, stating that on August 2, the British Minister to Thailand, Sir Josiah Crosby, visited Thai Prime Minister General Phibunsongkhram for an hour-long meeting. Subsequently, the British, American, and Dutch consuls stationed in Bangkok, but the Thai acting foreign minister considered the matter. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun also reported yesterday that Chinese businessmen in Bangkok were aware that Britain had suggested that Thailand enter into a commercial agreement to stop transporting rice, rubber, and tin to Japan. If Thailand agrees, it can recover its lost territories. Britain is now trying to prevent the transportation of goods to Thailand, such as tin ore, in order to force Thailand to stop transporting tin to Japan.

### Japan Eager to Overcome Economic Difficulties: Ogura Hosts Banquet for Financiers

Reuters, Tokyo, 9th: Finance Minister Ogura invited 28 prominent financiers to a luncheon at his official residence, where he delivered a speech expressing his determination to implement the government's monetary and economic policies and stabilize the nation's currency activities. He stated that under the current delicate and changing international situation, the government will carefully implement the cabinet's decisions on monetary and financial policies and requested the sincere support of the financiers so that the government can effectively implement various economic measures to overcome all difficulties and enable the nation's finances to safely navigate the current critical situation. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance announced the establishment of a special committee within the Foreign Exchange Control Committee to study and implement concrete measures to cope with the economic pressure imposed by foreign countries. This special committee will include the director of the Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, the director of the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the director of the Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the section chiefs of the Planning Board, led by an official from the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that this new committee will meet next week to discuss measures for navigation, trade, and foreign exchange adjustment activities.

### Japanese Funds Frozen in the United States, Valued at $130 Million

United Press, Washington, 9th: The Department of Commerce estimated yesterday that the total value of Japanese assets frozen by the United States is $130,000,000. The Department of Commerce stated that, according to the freezing order, not only must all assets of the frozen countries within this country obtain a permit before being traded, but also all other financial transactions between the United States and the frozen countries must obtain a permit. The freezing of foreign assets should be regarded as a kind of protection and custody during the current emergency, because freezing control is a special element of national defense. Interest, dividends, rent, and funds are still allowed to be freely transferred from the United States until the various freezes transfer this type of transaction to official control. The Treasury Department stated that the frozen Japanese assets are not much compared to the $2,200,000,000 in European assets that were frozen on July 14.

Reuters, Tokyo, 9th: Japanese sources say that as a result of the freezing of Japanese assets by Britain and the United States, Japanese rayon export merchants held a meeting in Osaka and passed a resolution to establish an association to adjust the rayon export plan. It is reported that this newly established association will provide financial assistance to export merchants who are forced to postpone their export goods.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: According to a Japanese government spokesperson, since the U.S. government froze Japanese funds, the U.S. authorities have stopped issuing permits for the export of kerosene to Japan, and other commercial issues between the U.S. and Japan have not been resolved.

### Nations Abiding by Public Law Need Not Fear Encirclement: Hull Responds to Tokyo's Remarks, Acknowledges Japan is to Blame

Reuters, Washington, 9th: Sources here believe that if the claim by Japanese officials that Britain and the United States believe Japan has aggressive intentions towards Thailand is indeed a mistake, then that would be a great thing, but they fear that Britain and the United States may not be mistaken. U.S. Secretary of State Hull has given a full reply to Japan's opposition to being surrounded. Hull said that countries that abide by the law need not worry about encirclement. This means that if Japan has no aggressive intentions and is peace-loving, as its spokesperson said, then the United States has no reason to worry about it. People here generally find it difficult to believe that the seizure of Manchuria, the invasion of China, and the occupation of Vietnam are the actions of a peace-loving country, and considering the clear evidence of the pressure on Thailand, they are convinced that their suspicions of Japan are well-founded. Thailand has never requested to join the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere promoted by Japan, but Tokyo insists that Thailand must be included in the sphere. This also contradicts Tokyo's recent statement that it does not want to invade Thailand and is difficult to reconcile.

Attacking Thailand Is Like a Desperate Gamble

There is a feeling in Washington that everything coming from Tokyo has the same tone of Japanese, but the technique is Nazi. Japan's statement that it does not want to invade Thailand is like Germany's statement before swallowing up many European countries that it would not invade other countries. Many believe that Thailand will be the starting point of the Pacific War, just as Poland was the starting point of the European War. However, as seen from here, Japan does not have the strong position in the Pacific that Germany had in Europe when it launched its aggression. If it dares to invade Thailand, it is like risking the fate of the entire country in a desperate gamble. Japanese leaders should now believe the words of Hull and Eden and know that this great danger exists. If they know it and still want to risk it, then there may be no such people. Therefore, it is believed here that Tokyo at least now realizes that the risk of this move is too great.

United Press, Washington, 9th: Secretary of State Hull replied yesterday to reports from Tokyo that Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies were encircling Japan, saying that countries that abide by international law need not fear encirclement. He also said that if any country finds itself surrounded by countries that abide by international law, it is to blame.

Germany Plans to Control Latin America

Regarding Germany's attempt to control Latin America, Hull said that this is a constant excuse made by a country that has already seized fifteen European countries and is thinking of conquering the Americas. Hull said that what the Germans are saying is a transparent propaganda, and no one in the Western Hemisphere believes it. He also said that the State Department is studying how to rescue Americans who are suffering in Japan, Britain, or other regions. Hull refused to comment on the content of his talks with Soviet Ambassador Oumansky and the chief representative of the Soviet mission to Washington, Ivanovitch.

Japanese Foreign Minister Claims Loyalty to Axis Powers

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: Foreign Minister Toyoda said yesterday at a reception for Axis journalists that Germany, Japan, and Italy, linked together by a solemn alliance, will cooperate to overcome the various obstacles on their common path.

Reuters, Rome, 9th: According to news released here, Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda wrote in response to questions from Tokyo reporters of German and Italian official news agencies that no encirclement, whether implemented or being prepared, can cause Japan to turn back from the path it is currently taking. Japan will pay attention to any new plans that threaten Japan's security and the security of East Asia. He added that Japan is now monitoring the situation with great attention because Japan cannot ignore the political and military developments that may occur around it.

### British and American Nationals Evacuate from Vietnam

Reuters, Saigon, 9th: Yesterday, 55 American nationals left here aboard the French ship "Chaffeurs" for Manila. On Sunday, 15 British nationals will go to Singapore. After that, there will only be 15 British people left here, including the consul-general and his staff.

### Japanese Consul-General Goto Arrives in Sydney

Reuters, Sydney, 9th: The Japanese ship "Kashima Maru" arrived here today from Yokohama, eight days behind schedule. A Dutch destroyer boarded the ship in the sea north of Australia. Japanese Consul-General Goto and Second Secretary Fukushima of the Japanese Embassy arrived on the ship. After learning the latest news, Goto said that if war was about to break out, he would have no need to come here. However, he did not think that war was about to break out, as the fact that the government sent him to Sydney could prove this. The ship also carried 53 Polish people who had escaped from Poland to Japan via the Soviet Union.

### Under Violent Oppression, the People of Southern Europe are Increasingly Anti-German; Guerrillas Control Mountainous Areas, Engaging in Regular Warfare with German Occupation Forces

Reuters, Jerusalem, 9th: News of an open rebellion against the German occupation forces in Yugoslavia, reported by Moscow, has been confirmed by responsible sources in Southern Europe here. It is said that the resistance of the Serbian people is becoming increasingly fierce, to the extent that the occupation authorities can only control the larger cities, while all smaller towns and mountainous areas are controlled by guerrillas. There are no fewer than 50,000 guerrillas in the Santzak and Herzegovina regions of Montenegro (also known as the Black Mountain Country). Serbians in northern Bosnia have rebelled and are now fighting fiercely in the Krajina and Kotor regions. Disruptions to railway traffic are increasing daily, and crops everywhere are being destroyed and hidden. An important tunnel near Pirot on the Nish-Sofia railway has been blown up. German retaliation is brutal: 216 people have been killed in Belgrade, the city has been fined 10 million Yugoslav dinars, and strict martial law has been imposed. In the Vojvodina region, 90 Serbians have been executed for destroying crops.

Reuters, French Border, 9th: News from Zagreb says that Serbian guerrillas and German occupation forces are now engaged in regular warfare in Bosnia. The Serbians are now holding steep mountains, using the weapons and ammunition hidden by the retreating Yugoslav regular army. Guerrillas launch attacks on German outposts every night and carry out sabotage operations, even bombing important railway bridges.

### Franco-German Negotiations Reach Tense Stage: Rumors of German Demand for North African Bases; Weygand Returns to Vichy to Meet Pétain

International News Agency, Vichy, 9th: General Weygand, commander of the French forces in Africa, flew here yesterday and dined with Marshal Pétain. Cabinet Secretary Darlan, who had been in Paris for two days, also returned to Vichy last night. Darlan is believed to have discussed with German representatives in Paris French policy towards Africa. Rumors are spreading that new Franco-German cooperation will begin soon, with France giving Germany French bases in North Africa.

United Press, Vichy, 9th: Sources here said yesterday that Germany may be granted port and transportation facilities in several French colonies. It is claimed that this convenience was the maximum concession from the French side to Germany's recent demands discussed at the Cabinet meeting on Saturday night. At the same time, General Weygand has from Algiers to have an important talk with the cabinet.

Reuters, London, 9th: The fact that French North African Commander Weygand is now going to Vichy is believed here to mean that Franco-German negotiations on the defense of French territory have now reached a tense stage, and the direct consequence of Vichy's order making General Weygand subordinate to Darlan is almost certainly ordered by the German side, as the Germans do not trust Weygand. Weygand is supported by the French people, is far more popular than Darlan, and holds real power in North Africa. If Weygand goes to Vichy and disagrees with Darlan, it will be as expected, as the French people of North Africa do not want to see their land handed over to Germany and break off relations with the United States.

### General Dentz Placed Under British Detention: Vichy Protests to Britain

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 9th: The French government has instructed its ambassador to Britain, Pietri, to protest to the British government about the detention of General Dentz and 35 other French officials.

Reuters, London, 9th: Reports from Beirut that former High Commissioner to Syria Dentz and several other Vichy officers had been detained were due to the fact that 75 Indian officers captured during the Syrian war had been flown away by Vichy pilots to an unknown destination and had not yet returned. A communiqué issued by the British military headquarters in Beirut stated that about 35 Vichy senior officers in Syria and Lebanon, including General Dentz, were detained by British authorities yesterday afternoon and will be detained in Palestine as collateral pending the implementation of Article 7 of the armistice agreement. According to this article, the Vichy authorities guaranteed the return of all Allied officers captured during the war, but the Vichy authorities have not yet clearly announced the whereabouts of some of the captured officers, and some of these officers have been found in areas occupied by the Axis powers, so the British army has the necessity to detain Vichy senior officers. According to military sources in Beirut, the repatriation of Vichy troops who wish to leave Syria is still proceeding in accordance with the terms of the agreement. It is reported that once all the Allied officers who were taken away from Syria have been found, the 35 Vichy officers can be released. It is believed that some of the captured British troops were taken away from Syria when the armistice agreement was first signed. Several French ships recently arrived in Beirut to continue carrying back Vichy civilians and troops.

Reuters, Ankara, 9th: Two senior officials of the German secret police have arrived in Istanbul by special plane and have had close contact with the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen. It is claimed that they will soon go to Iran. German activities in Iran have caused anxiety in the Middle East. Turkey's attitude towards Iran is very clear: it wants it to maintain neutrality and be a pillar of peace together with other signatory countries of the Saadabad Pact. In short, Turkey does not want to see any disputes occur in Iran, which might lead to the Soviet Union occupying western Iran. Turkey admits to being somewhat anxious about the situation in Iran, but hopes that the Iranian government will be able to maintain peace and neutrality in the future.

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 9th: A telegram from Iran received here says that reports from abroad that Iran has already mobilized are inaccurate. The Iranian embassy here also said that it did not know that Iran had already mobilized, but partial mobilization is underway in preparation for defense. Reports that Iranian troops are concentrated along Kermanshah and Lake Urmia have also been confirmed by travelers arriving here from the area, but reports of large-scale concentration have not yet been confirmed.

Reuters, Rome, 9th: The Italian official news agency reports from Berlin that responsible sources in Berlin firmly deny rumors that the German government threatened Iran that if it expelled German nationals from its territory, it would sever diplomatic relations with Iran.

### Retaliation Bombing of Moscow: Soviet Aircraft Attack Berlin Twice

Reuters, London, 9th: Soviet aircraft attacked Berlin on Thursday night, the first time since the start of the Soviet-German war, and the mystery of the mysterious bombing of Berlin on Sunday night has been solved. According to a Moscow radio broadcast last night, Soviet aircraft initially decided to attack Berlin on Thursday night, dropping several incendiary and high-explosive bombs on military targets. Explosions and fires were seen, and Soviet aircraft carried out extensive reconnaissance flights in German airspace before returning safely to their original defenses without losing a single aircraft. The German radio station said that Berlin had recently been attacked, with slight damage to buildings and some civilian casualties.

United Press, London, 9th: According to the "Exchange Telegraph" news from Moscow, the Soviet Air Force attacked military targets in various districts of Berlin on Thursday night. Explosions and large fires were said to have been continuous, and all Soviet aircraft returned safely. The Soviet embassy here said that if reports of the Soviet air raid on Berlin are confirmed, it would be the first time that Soviet aircraft have bombed the German mainland, and also a retaliatory blow against Germany for the initial German air raid on Moscow. The air force here reported that the aircraft that decided to attack Berlin were definitely not from the Royal Air Force, because the Royal Air Force "did not attack Berlin on Sunday night."

Reuters, London, 9th: According to news from Moscow, Soviet aircraft continued to fly to and bomb the German capital last night after the air raid on Berlin on Thursday night. The German side also admitted that its capital had been attacked for two consecutive nights. Last night, the German radio stations in Warsaw, Kalisz, and Latvia all stopped broadcasting due to air raids.

Reuters, Stockholm, 9th: Correspondents for Swedish newspapers in Berlin reported that when Soviet aircraft first raided Berlin on Thursday night, residents were caught off guard because they did not know that enemy aircraft were overhead until the bombs exploded.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th: A responsible source in Berlin declared that German aircraft had a successful air raid on Moscow on the night of the 6th, with heavy damage to the Soviet capital's aircraft factory. Only one German aircraft did not return to its original defenses. In recent days, German aircraft bombing Moscow have caused ten fires in aircraft factories, and many places in the eastern and southern districts of Moscow have also been hit.

United Press, Moscow, 9th: Officials revealed yesterday that German aircraft had bombed the Academy of Sciences here on a recent night. The academy is one of Moscow's famous scenic spots. The academy's library was burned down by incendiary bombs, and the building contained 3 million volumes of books.

### Southern Ukrainian Region Becomes Focus of Soviet-German War: Germany Claims to Have Occupied Korosten, Threatening the Black Sea Port of Odessa

Reuters, London Military, 9th: Fierce fighting continued throughout the day yesterday on the entire Soviet front, with the main focus still on Ukraine. The battle for the two key cities of Kyiv and Odessa in the region is raging. According to the latest news, the main force of the German army is advancing, but has shifted from Kyiv to the southeast, possibly to invade the Black Sea port of Odessa.

A Soviet communiqué released late last night stated that there had been fighting in the areas of Keksholm, Smolensk, Korosten, and Belaya Tserkov, as well as on the Estonian front. It also stated that the Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with the army, inflicted blows on German mechanized units, infantry, and German aircraft. On Sunday, the Soviet side destroyed 21 German aircraft, and the Soviet aircraft lost ten. On the afternoon of the 8th, Soviet fighter planes shot down a German reconnaissance plane near Moscow, and the crew was arrested.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th: German infantry occupied the railway center of Korosten yesterday. The city is 75 kilometers northeast of Kyiv. The German army occupied the city after severely damaging the remnants of the Soviet 5th Army and reinforcements in the forest and swamp area. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet army has used the city as a supply center.

United Press, New York, 9th: The German army's advance into the fertile agricultural and industrial areas of Soviet Ukraine seemed to be quite successful yesterday. The British believe that Odessa is already under threat. The German High Command claimed to have occupied Uman, a major railway center 155 miles north of Odessa. Odessa is 80 miles south of Belaya Tserkov and 120 miles south of Kyiv. British sources said that the German army is advancing south along the right bank of the Dnieper River towards Odessa and Nikolaev, which is 70 miles northeast. It is believed that the plains there are conducive to offensive operations, and it is suspected that when the Nazis reach the coast, the Soviet army may not be able to establish a strong new position to defend the Black Sea coast. The "London Times" warned of the danger of the German army considering the oil use of Ukrainians, Caucasians, Indians, and the Middle East. Moscow said that there was nothing about the news about Ukraine.

Reuters, London, 9th: According to responsible sources in London, the German threat to Odessa is becoming more and more serious. Judging from the current situation, the German army is progressing faster and faster from Belaya Tserkov towards the southeast, and is advancing west along the southern side of the Dnieper River, having already passed Kyiv. The German army is attempting to cross the river but is facing resistance. The main force will bypass the river towards the Black Sea in an attempt to encircle Odessa and the city of Nikolaev in the interior. If successful, it will cut off Odessa and other places from the north. However, if the German army encounters unexpected resistance, it may change its direction of attack. It is reported that a railway line between Kyiv and Odessa has been cut off, but traffic on other railway lines between the two places has not been affected. There were few changes in the war situation in other areas of the Soviet front yesterday.

### Rainy and Freezing Seasons Approaching in Soviet Territory, War Prospects Favorable to Soviets

United Press, Washington, 9th: Sources arriving here today claimed that the fierce resistance of the Soviet army to the German army's effectiveness, as well as the approaching rainy season in Soviet territory, have led most military experts in the United States to believe that the German army is unlikely to achieve success on the eastern front this year. Therefore, the final victory of the Allied countries is more hopeful. These people pointed out that the German army has not yet gained any strategically important strongholds, and the climate in the next six weeks may be favorable to the Soviet army, and they believe that German mechanized teams will be trapped in the mud. It is also said that there are often heavy rains in Soviet territory in mid-September, and there is heavy snow at any time, and water freezes in November. Military experts pay special attention to the freezing climate because the Soviet Union has special experience in aviation during the freezing period.

### German War Report Extravagantly Claims Victory, 25th Red Army Division Annihilated

Haitong News Agency, Headquarters of the Führer, 9th: The German Supreme Command announced last night that, after the German army's new offensive was announced in the special military report, initial battle results have now been obtained in Ukraine. According to a report by Army Group Commander Marshal von Rundstedt, as a result of the cooperation between the army group and Air Force Commander General Löhr, the Soviet 6th and 12th Armies and part of the 18th Army, a total of 25 infantry, mountain, armored, and motorized divisions, have been annihilated. A total of 103,000 prisoners have been captured, and the commanders of the 6th and 12th Armies have also been captured. In addition, there are 317 armored vehicles, 858 cannons, 5,250 trucks, several trains loaded with ammunition, and countless other war trophies. The enemy's losses are extremely heavy, and the number that has already been confirmed exceeds 200,000.

### Strong Soviet Reserves; Active Guerrilla Warfare in German-Occupied Areas

Reuters, London, 9th -- Although the German side announced that the Battle of Smolensk had been won and concluded, a Berlin correspondent for a Swiss newspaper reported that the continued advance of German forces toward Moscow depends on the number of reserves the Red Army can deploy to the battlefield. The Soviet Union's successful transfer of reserves from its Asian territories is evident. It is widely known that the Soviet Union has a very large army in the countryside. Although the German side is now making predictions that the Soviet army will soon be defeated, it is understood that even if the Soviet army is defeated, it does not mean the end of the Soviet-German war. It is predicted that the Soviet army will launch large-scale guerrilla warfare and conduct local, long-term resistance. The strength of the Soviet army's resistance has been quite unexpected. Their staff officers appear to be quite capable, and the Soviet army's tenacity and adequate equipment are surprisingly impressive.

General Timoshenko, commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in the central region (including Smolensk), recently called on the people in the Soviet territory temporarily occupied by the German army to join guerrilla units to intercept and destroy German transport units in the rear, destroy bridges, cut telegraph and telephone lines, burn houses and forests that could be used by German soldiers for shelter, and not provide the enemy with any food.

Reuters, London, 9th -- According to reliable sources here, guerrilla warfare in Poland is increasing daily. German military transport continues to be disrupted by Polish guerrillas, and several ammunition trains heading to the Eastern Front have been blown up by landmines en route. It is also reported that German soldiers are going missing every day in the dense Polish forests.

### Romanian Army Suffers 100,000 Casualties Aiding German Operations, Public Resentment Boils

Reuters, Lisbon, 9th -- According to reliable sources, Romania has lost 100,000 soldiers on the Eastern Front and has experienced great difficulties in supplying provisions and ammunition. Romanian dictator Prime Minister Antonescu has requested German reinforcements. The heavy losses of the Romanian army have caused widespread demoralization. Anti-Antonescu disturbances have occurred in the Romanian capital, Galați, Brăila, and Constanța. Some people are greatly concerned about the safety of King Michael of Romania, who is effectively being held captive by Antonescu.

### Scenes of Hong Kong as Described by an American Correspondent in China (1)

Mr. M. Gelhorn, a correspondent for the American Coal Shipping Weekly, recently traveled through Hong Kong and drafted an article on his impressions of Hong Kong, published in Collier's magazine. It describes the general living conditions in Hong Kong and a glimpse of local defense, which can provide a glimpse of the overall preparations currently underway in Hong Kong. Excerpts are as follows:

Mountains Reflecting the Azure Sea

Rising from the calm, blue-gray sea are countless verdant peaks; this is the appearance of Hong Kong. Hong Kong is surrounded by many small islands, arranged like uninhabitable dots in the ocean. Across a bay from Hong Kong are Kowloon City and the New Territories. The New Territories are a wedge-shaped, mountainous land, the main route from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. Every winter, the green mountains of Hong Kong and the yellow hills of the New Territories are shrouded in fog, rain, and low gray clouds. But in spring, the breeze is gentle and pleasant, similar to Florida, California, or southern France in the United States.

In front of the harbor, junks gather, the countless masts forming a dividing line. Beyond this line, the green ferries connecting Hong Kong and Kowloon whistle and their paddlewheels churn ceaselessly. Cargo ships are docked on the Kowloon side, while mail ships are moored far out in the ocean. A gray British cruiser heads out to sea, preceded by many sampans. Lighters, yachts, naval boats, local water patrol boats, and so on crisscross the sea. The harbor's activity, congestion, and noise are just like the streets of Hong Kong.

To a first-time visitor, Hong Kong appears as: New Year's Eve in Times Square, the authentic scene of a five o'clock bullfight, a fire alarm sounding three times, a public auction, and a rural market playing the organ. The streets run parallel to the coast, with three streets on flat ground; behind them are mountain roads that climb upwards. Stone steps are lined with houses and shops. The mountainside is covered in lush greenery, and further up, protruding from the peaks, are countless mansions of the wealthy. The wealthy residents of the mountains can see all the beautiful scenery in the harbor and the densely packed city streets, but they cannot hear or smell anything.

The population of Hong Kong is eight hundred thousand, most of whom are crowded into rooms with eight or ten people. The city is simply filled with the breath of its residents, as well as the smoke from Chinese cooking, the aroma of kueh (a type of snack), the garbage in the ditches, and the smell of sewage from houses without sewers. Occasionally, a gentle breeze blows from the verdant land, and the market feels warm and fragrant, along with the scent of dried seaweed. But you must understand what kind of state Hong Kong is in.

Beneath the various orange, red, and yellow shop signs, pictures and slogans are posted on the pillars of the shops. Chinese coolies walk slowly, and the sound of wooden clogs on the cement pavement is heard everywhere. Suddenly, amidst the various noises, a string of firecrackers sounds like machine-gun fire. The sound of the firecrackers can make you unable to hear any warning sound for ten minutes, and there is also a strong smell of gunpowder. Someone is always celebrating a birthday or getting married; firecrackers are said to bring good luck. Once the firecrackers have finished exploding, Hong Kong is finally quiet for a while.

From the carved beams and painted pillars on the mountain peaks to the dirty alleys near the harbor below, Hong Kong is like a continuous circus. There are special boxes for the gentry, and the side shows in the circus are very elaborate. Happy Valley Racecourse is a circle of green, surrounded by mountains. The racecourse is located between mountain peaks and slums, with these two worlds separated by this mere fence. On race days, an average of HK$500,000 in lottery tickets is sold. This year, the first prize was HK$397,600, which was won by four poor Chinese women. On one side of the field, the flags selling lottery tickets are like the calls of rebels. On a large cloth banner, the names of the horses and the winning numbers are written in Chinese, and layers of Chinese people stand by the fence to watch, paying a few cents each.

On the other side of the fence is the club, with private viewing platforms on the roof. Each platform has a dining room attached. Wealthy Chinese and Westerners, women wearing high-collared, long, tight cheongsams, pour out of the platforms to buy horse tickets at the lottery stalls. Amateur jockeys include Portuguese, Chinese, Russians, and British, wearing dazzling clothes and riding small horses around the field. At lunchtime, poor women squeeze out of the racetrack and leave Happy Valley barefoot. (To be continued)

### British Aircraft Raid Military Targets in Northwest Germany

Reuters, London, 9th -- Last night, British bombers flew over northwestern Germany again, heavily bombing military and industrial targets. The Kiel naval port was heavily bombed. According to this morning's Air Ministry communique, British aircraft heavily bombed the Kiel naval base last night under bright moonlight, hitting docks and shipyards, causing five major fires. Hamburg and other places were also attacked by British aircraft. Four British aircraft are missing.

Reuters, Cairo, 9th -- The Ministry of Interior issued a communique stating that 13 people were killed and 23 injured in the bombing of Alexandria on Thursday night. Houses were slightly damaged.

### Tsarist-Era Officer Re-emerges, Commands All Soviet Forces

United Press, Rome, 9th -- The Italian official Stefani News Agency claimed that Shaposhnikov, a former officer of the Tsarist era, has assumed command of all Soviet forces.

### German Army Casualties on the Eastern Front Total 500,000, Germany Admits

Reuters, French Border, 9th -- According to German sources, the German army has suffered a total of 500,000 casualties on the Eastern Front. The total number of wounded and captured has not been announced.

### US Considering Eliminating the North European War Zone, Shipping War Materials to the USSR Via the Atlantic

United Press, Washington, 9th -- Reliable authorities here said yesterday that the elimination of the northernmost four Scandinavian war zones is currently under official discussion in order to allow the United States to quickly transport war materials to the Soviet Union. The first indication of this move was Interior Secretary Ickes' announcement that four oil tankers would be transporting oil to the Soviet Union. He recalled that these territorial waters were included in the war zone because of the Soviet invasion of Finland, which was then considered a blow to the Soviet Union, but the current situation has clearly changed. Another reason for using the Atlantic route is to avoid passing through Japan's territory via Vladivostok.

### Polish Military Delegation Arrives in Moscow

Reuters, Moscow, 9th -- A Polish military delegation led by the famous Polish General Szczygiel has arrived here.

### Britain Restores Original Summer Time, Clocks Turn Back One Hour

Reuters, London, 9th -- British clocks will be turned back one hour at 1:00 AM tomorrow, restoring the original summer time. The double summer time, which has been in effect since May 4, will be abolished.

### Approaching Fourth Anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai, Both Concessions Prepare Yesterday

Unnecessary Roads are Blocked with Wire Mesh

Communities Prepare for Solemn Commemoration

The fourth anniversary of "August 13th" is fast approaching. The concession authorities began special preparations yesterday, blocking unnecessary roads, prohibiting gatherings and parades, and strictly enforcing the curfew. Various sectors of the community are preparing for a solemn commemoration. Details are as follows:

All Sectors Prepare for Solemn Commemoration

The Shanghai community, given the upcoming fourth anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai and the special environment of Shanghai, decided to comply with the wishes of the concession authorities and not hold extravagant commemorative ceremonies. However, in order to express the citizens' belief in resisting aggression and to mourn the fallen soldiers and compatriots, it was decided that everyone would observe a vegetarian diet for one day and suspend entertainment and banquets. At noon, everyone would stand in silence to mourn, as a solemn commemoration.

Concession Authorities Begin Preparations

The police authorities of both concessions, with the anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai approaching, began special preparations to ensure the security of the concessions. The Public Concession, starting yesterday morning, placed barbed wire on unnecessary roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, such as Jiangxi Road, Guangxi Road, Daitou Bridge, Yunnan Road, Longmen Road, Chongqing Road, Lulai Road, and Muller Road, cutting off traffic. Other areas, such as the Bund, Sichuan Road, Henan Road, Zhengjia Muqiao East New Bridge, Great World, Chengdu Road, Tongfu Road, and Seymour Road, were also fenced off, with entrances and exits guarded by detectives to check suspicious pedestrians. Each bridge over the Suzhou Creek was also guarded by eight officers to conduct inspections. Furthermore, all gatherings, parades, and demonstrations were prohibited, and the curfew was tightened. Although the French authorities have not yet blocked roads, their other measures are the same as those of the Public Concession. These measures will be extended until the 14th. On the anniversary, the bridge and road closures will be tightened as needed to ensure the security of the concessions.

### Yesterday the Wind and Rain Ceased, the City Restored to Normal

Hurricane Passed Over Shanghai and Attacked North China, Land and Water Transportation Have Been Restored

The Pacific hurricane, which swept across northern Shanghai at 9:00 PM the night before with winds of force seven to nine, still had lingering effects yesterday, and the autumn rain was intermittent, with the sky sometimes dark and sometimes bright. By evening, the weather gradually cleared. However, because yesterday was still the autumn flood tide, although the accumulated water from the night before gradually receded, the low-lying areas were still flooded. However, the situation was much better than the day before, so public transportation gradually resumed, and the cross signal hoisted by the customs was lowered. Shipping, which had been interrupted for a day, resumed. Details are as follows:

Hurricane Heads North, Directly Towards the Yellow Sea

According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, after the hurricane swept over Shanghai, its direction of travel was north-northwest, and its position was between 122 degrees east longitude and 33 degrees north latitude, with a wind force of five to six. It still had the potential to cross the East China Sea and enter the Yellow Sea. The coastal areas of northern Jiangsu and northern China will be affected, but because the wind force and speed are decreasing daily, the damage will not be too severe. It is understood that many small wave boats and sampans were sunk off the mouth of Wusong the night before due to the direct impact of the hurricane's center, but all ships in the Huangpu River had been warned by the customs and had taken refuge in safe places, fortunately avoiding a major tragedy.

Inbound and Outbound Shipping Gradually Resumes

Few ships entered the Huangpu River, and there were no outbound ships. At noon, the customs lifted the alert, and the signal ball was lowered. Traffic on the Huangpu River gradually resumed. The first ship to enter the port yesterday was the Huatong small ferry, which runs to northern Jiangsu, arriving at 9:40 AM. This was followed by the Japanese ship Mutou Maru, which runs on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, entering the port at 10:55 AM, returning to Shanghai from Ningbo. At 12:10 PM, the Kompei wheel arrived at the port. At 3:20 PM (the above times are according to the customs clock), the Taikoo Company's Anshun wheel arrived in Shanghai from southern China and docked at the Pudong Wharf. Among the departures yesterday afternoon, the Hanyang wheel sailed to Hong Kong, the Dingsheng wheel went to Yantai-Tianjin, the French wheel Laoyasi sailed to Haiphong, and the Huatong small ferry also departed for northern Jiangsu. Only eight ships entered and left the port all day yesterday. Taikoo Company's New Beijing wheel, presumably sheltering from the wind en route, has not yet been seen and is expected to arrive today. According to shipping industry sources, this hurricane did not have a major impact on the city because it did not directly hit it.

### British and American Interests in Shanghai are Determined to be Upheld

Even if the Situation is Severe, They are Determined Not to Give Up

As Japan aggressively launches an invasion of Thailand, the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly tense. The Far East's powder keg is on the verge of exploding. Shanghai, as the largest commercial port in the Far East, is naturally more affected than other places. Yesterday, British and American expatriates in Shanghai began to evacuate, and Pacific shipping is about to be cut off, causing extreme panic among the general public. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency, in order to find out the truth, visited relevant figures in the port yesterday and received the following opinions: A leader of the American business community said that the deterioration of the situation in the Far East has reached its peak today. The United States is determined not to allow the threats of aggressor countries to force us to abandon our legitimate interests in the Far East. Shanghai has lost its political status and is only a commercial center. If the Pacific war unfortunately breaks out, we will still maintain our business in Shanghai and will not retreat. There are not many American expatriates in Vietnam and Xichang, and the scope of business is very narrow, so it is appropriate for American expatriates to evacuate as soon as possible. The situation in Shanghai is different and cannot be generalized. The so-called evacuation order is only a suggestion to encourage voluntary action. Those who have important commercial and other duties are not included. The rumor that the United States has begun to accelerate the evacuation of American expatriates in Shanghai is unreliable.

Long Prepared, Not Intimidated by Threats

An important British expatriate said that the Pacific war would be an integral part of the European war and could not be separated. We are prepared and will not allow our rights and interests to be harmed. As for the Sino-British alliance, it is the result of ulterior motives and is exaggerated. In any case, the necessary precautions in the Far East have now been completed. We are prepared to accept anyone's provocation. There are still over ten thousand British expatriates in Shanghai, including Indians and British-Chinese. However, there has been no special evacuation recently.

### Dali and Daxin Wheels to Trial Shanghai-Aotou Line

The Shanghai-Wenzhou route was interrupted due to the Jianghai Customs stopping clearance for a long time. According to shipping industry sources, recently, the merchant Dali wheel, intending to load cargo from Shanghai to Guleitou, returned to Shanghai a few days ago. The British merchant Daxin wheel also set sail from Shanghai on the 7th of this month, but there has been no telegram up to yesterday. Because the two wheels are trial voyages, they did not carry passengers. However, it is understood that the Jianghai Customs has not yet formally permitted customs clearance for the shipping wheels there.

### Swiss and Dutch Consulates Retreat Far Eastern Overseas Chinese

Limited to those who reside on a "non-essential" basis

Shanghai Japanese and Swiss Overseas Chinese Retreat at the Same Time

The Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Fontanna, told reporters yesterday that the Swiss authorities are currently carrying out the evacuation of "non-essential" Swiss nationals residing in China and Japan, but this plan should not be regarded as a complete retreat of Swiss nationals in the Far East. Mr. Fang also said that he had received instructions from the Swiss Legation in Japan, instructing him to find out whether there were any "non-essential" overseas Chinese in this place. The Swiss Legation in Tokyo has compiled a list of Swiss overseas Chinese who will retreat from Japan, and wants to know the names of "non-essential" overseas Chinese in Shanghai in order to retreat together. He has notified the Swiss overseas Chinese here of the steps taken by the Swiss Legation, but he believes that only a few Swiss overseas Chinese in Shanghai will retreat. As for other details, it is not yet known, and it is not known from where the Swiss overseas Chinese will gather to return home. According to the number of Swiss overseas Chinese in Japan, there are one thousand people, and there are 450 people in Shanghai.

Dutch Consulate Issues Notice of Retreat

It is also understood that the Dutch Consulate in this port has received government instructions, formally issued a notice, urging its overseas Chinese to register with the office in order to handle the retreat matters. All non-essential Dutch overseas Chinese in the occupied areas of China are allowed to be women and children, and they are urged to retreat and return to the Dutch Indies. There are more than 300 overseas Chinese under the jurisdiction of the Dutch Consulate in this port, and 150 under the jurisdiction of Tianjin Dutch Indies, of which 120 are clergy. In addition, there are about 400 Chinese who have entered the Dutch Indies, and they are also ordered to report to the consulate in order to retreat in time.

### Local Business and Industry Sympathize with Scholarships

Dingxin Factory Donates 5,000 Yuan Yesterday

Anonymous Person Personally Comes to Our Museum for Assistance

The scholarship of our newspaper readers yesterday accepted donations from all walks of life, reaching more than 7,000 yuan. This number has exceeded the highest peak of 6,000 yuan on the tenth day of this month, which shows that readers are promoting the scholarship more and more enthusiastically. Details are as follows:

The Creative Initiative of Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory

Yesterday, Mr. Lu Shoulun, a giant in the advertising industry, for the third time raised funds through the Universal Pharmaceutical Factory and transferred them to the Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, which generously donated 5,000 yuan. The factory's letter said, "The launch of your newspaper's scholarship has received responses from far and wide. From then on, the talented students will never stop singing and reading. We are in awe of this great move and express our gratitude. Our factory will do its best to contribute, and we will not lag behind others. We are sending a check for 5,000 yuan with this letter, and we hope that you will accept it." Dingxin Factory is large in scale, completely scientifically managed, and the Ba Wang brand blue cloth is strong, durable, and never fades. Dingxin nylon and various colored poplin fabrics have large sales, saving many rights and interests every year.

The Anonymous Old Man is Kind and Enthusiastic

An anonymous person, under the pseudonym of A Pitiful Person in This World, previously sent a letter, willing to help our newspaper sponsor the tuition and miscellaneous fees for 50 students of all levels, elementary and middle schools, every semester. When asked how much it would cost, our newspaper estimated that it would cost 2,000 yuan, which was publicly replied on the 6th. After receiving the letter, the anonymous person sent another letter deciding to personally sell the money yesterday, and to talk face to face. Until 10:30 AM yesterday, the anonymous person came to the museum on time and was received by a representative of our newspaper. Because he changed his name, it was inconvenient to ask his name. According to his own statement, he is 56 years old this year, runs a bookstore, and his family is not wealthy. His son works in a foreign company and has been able to support himself. He himself is an optimist and is very sympathetic to our newspaper's scholarship, so he is happy to help. This gentleman is good at Taijiquan, and Zhu Changwen has been asking for it for 30 years. He was amiable when talking. The anonymous person also issued the following written opinions: I am nearly sixty years old, and the scenery is entering the sunset. I am doing small business, and my ability is weak. Because I admire the enthusiasm of the gentlemen who run the Shanghai News Reader Scholarship, I am following their example and doing my best to contribute a little. I hope that the students will follow the purpose of drawing porridge and chiseling walls, read diligently in Yun Chuang, and strive to make progress, so as not to live up to the painstaking efforts of the gentlemen who initiated the Shanghai News Scholarship. If I am still alive next semester, and the business does not change suddenly, I will continue to help. However, the way of heaven is changeable, and human affairs are uncertain, and everything is difficult to predict."

Tuition Fees are Sincere

Han Dazhao, who applied for secondary school a few days ago, stated that he had borrowed tuition fees from relatives and friends, and stated that he would no longer request assistance, so that it could be reserved for other poor and helpless students. Mr. Han's sincerity is commendable, so the original letter is appended, "Dear sir, I went to your museum a few days ago to apply for a scholarship, because the tuition fees of Huatong Public School are too high, and I could not raise them for a while, so I also followed the crowd and asked your museum for assistance, but now I have borrowed it from relatives and friends, so there is no need to spend your museum's subsidy again, so that there will be more assistance for those who have no way to do it. Please check out and send down all the attached documents, or send a letter to inform us, so that we can come to the front and receive it. I am very grateful for your hard work." Applicant Yu Huai also applied to cancel the registration because he already had tuition fees.

### Field Visit Records of Scholarship Applicants (4)

Orphans without fathers and widows without husbands are the most helpless people in the world. Among the students applying for the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship this time, many are orphans without fathers, and many are relying on their mothers to struggle to raise and educate them. For these children, how should we express our warm sympathy to help them succeed in their studies!

Virtuous Mothers

Amidst the magnificent buildings on Yuyuan Road, there is a commoner's alley, which is unexpected. In the living room of the first house, I met the aunt of this little sister. The living room is also the bedroom, and the furnishings are simple. Her mother had gone to teach at the summer school. Her aunt, also a primary school teacher, told me that the child's father was doing business in Tianjin before the war, but there has been no news of him since the incident, and it seems that he is no longer alive! She braved the flames of war in the Zhejiang war zone and brought them, the mother and her two daughters, out. There is also a younger sister who graduated from primary school this year and has been admitted to middle school. Their mother came to Shanghai and worked hard to teach in primary school, raising and educating them. But how can a humble primary school teacher afford the tuition fees for two middle school girls? If the Shenbao Scholarship application fails, then they will have to drop the younger sister out of school! But her mother's heart to nurture her children is very sincere, and the pair of clever and bright sisters are also eager to continue their studies!

Orphans and Widows

At a house on Hart Road, I also met a girl with the same fate. Her father passed away when she was five years old! Now she is going to be in the second year of junior high school. In these seven years, her mother has been teaching in primary school, raising her with great difficulty. Orphans and widows are truly worthy of our sympathy! Fortunately, the mother and daughter are Christians, and they believe that there is hope in hardship. Her mother told me that her teaching position for the next semester has not been decided yet! The child's math skills are poor, but she has a talent for music and plays the piano very well!

This Child Really Wants to Study

The sixteen-year-old boy is particularly tall, showing that he is in good physical condition. His father was a worker in a printing house and passed away four years ago. The mother and son rely on his uncle's support and the help of relatives. This year he is only a second-year junior high school student. With the rising cost of living, his uncle can no longer afford his tuition. But he told me that his education is not enough yet! Neighbors told me that their mother and son's life is really hard, but this child really wants to study. An elderly woman of about fifty, the child's mother, said, "We will repay the help that people give us in the future."

Leaving Behind Three Advertising Billboards

The sixteen-year-old child is male and is already in the second year of high school, indicating that he is quite intelligent. He has a handsome appearance, answers fluently, and is courteous. He lives in a pavilion room in a house on Carter Road. A mother and two sisters. His father passed away four years ago! It happened to be the year the war broke out! His father used to run a roadside advertising business. Now, what remains are three roadside billboards, and the four of them rely on this to make a living. After graduating from junior high school, he was recommended to Nanyang Middle School. He only paid half of the tuition for the last semester. He told me that Nanyang does not have any free places, but by the end of the semester, he had not paid the full amount, and the principal simply removed him from the school roll. Now, with the announcement of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship, he hopes to be able to help him complete his studies. (S)

### Mobil's Large Amount of Gasoline Seized, Has Negotiated with Customs

Mobil Believes that the Transportation of Oil Does Not Involve Politics, Only Technical Violations of Customs Regulations

Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Meiyao," carrying oil to ports on the Yangtze River, was detained by the Japanese for several days. Although the ship has now been released, the 1,600 barrels of oil it was carrying (five gallons per barrel) have been confiscated by the Japanese on some pretext. Regarding this matter, according to a Mobil Company representative yesterday, the company is currently in direct consultation with the Jianghai Customs authorities in order to recover the batch of oil. The representative firmly denied the statement by the Japanese Navy spokesman here that the "Meiyao" was transporting oil to supply the Chinese guerrillas. It is said that the detention of the "Meiyao" was not a political incident, but a customs incident. The ship is believed to have technically violated the Jianghai Customs Regulations, so they are seeking a solution in this regard. The "Meiyao" has now been returned to Mobil Oil Company by customs.

Alleging Supply to Chinese Guerrillas

The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 8th), it was disclosed at a reception for journalists held by the Japanese that the Japanese had returned the Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Meiyao" to the company. However, the 2,000 barrels of oil carried by the ship were confiscated. It was because the Japanese Navy found out that when the "Meiyao" was detained, it was chartered by a Chinese merchant firm to transport oil to supply the Chinese guerrillas who are still holding the north bank of the Yangtze River. The Xinhang port, where the "Meiyao" attempted to unload oil, is a port held by the guerrillas. It is reported that the "Meiyao" was detained by the Japanese on August 4th and then handed over to the Jianghai Customs, which in turn handed it over to Mobil Company. It is now berthed at the Mobil Wharf.

Afterwards, the Central Fire Brigade immediately dispatched multiple hose carts to the scene for rescue. Due to the intensity of the fire, it was not easy to extinguish.

### Deputy Executive Officer of the U.S. Narcotics Bureau Suddenly Detained in the Western Prison

Guns in the Bureau Not Reported

Suspected of Serious Misconduct, Leading to Detention and Interrogation

The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reported that the Public Concession Police, at the request of the U.S. authorities, arrested Mr. Teedale Pons, Deputy Executive Officer of the U.S. Narcotics Bureau in China, this morning (the 8th) and detained him in the Ward Road Western Prison for questioning. It is believed that Mr. Teedale was arrested because he failed to report to the U.S. authorities about the loss of several guns from the U.S. Narcotics Bureau.

Guns Lost from U.S. Bureau

The incident arose because the Municipal Council Police recently received several guns sent from the area outside the Shanghai West Concession, requesting registration in the Public Concession. The Police Department conducted an inspection and found that these guns belonged to the U.S. Narcotics Bureau. The U.S. authorities opened an inquiry, and because Mr. Teedale, as Deputy Executive Officer, had failed to report the loss of the guns, they requested the Police Department to arrest Mr. Teedale. It is known that Mr. Teedale had previously worked as a reporter at a radio station in Shanghai for a short period of time. A few months ago, he joined the U.S. Narcotics Bureau as Deputy Executive Officer, replacing Mr. Lee, the U.S. Narcotics Bureau's Executive Officer, who had returned to the United States for a short trip.

Considerable Stir Among All Parties

### Dr. Bai's Yellow and Black Medicine Sold for 20,000 Lira

The Catholic Action Association has yellow and black potions, which have miraculous effects in treating various internal and external ailments. They were created by the Italian Benedictine priest Dr. Bai (Prof. Benussi Bossi). Dr. Bai came to China in 1887 and practiced medicine in Suzhou, using these medicines to treat people, often with miraculous results. Lu Bohong and Zhu Zhiyao and other gentlemen raised 20,000 Italian lira to obtain his formula to make medicine to help the world, and it was kept by Lu Bohong, Zhu Zhiyao, Zhuang Zhenjia, and Nuo Meibei. After Lu Bohong and Zhuang Zhenjia passed away, Lu Yigeng and Zhou Jusheng filled the vacancies. The medicinal materials used are both Chinese and Western, weighing more than 30 kilograms, and cannot be made into medicine without three years of refining. Black potion (Camphorated Sulpho-Carbide) mainly treats cholera, vomiting and diarrhea, dysentery, abdominal pain, heart palpitations, blood loss, insomnia, loss of appetite, neurasthenia, indigestion and other diseases. Yellow potion (Antivirns Naftoliato) is for local disinfection, anti-inflammation and swelling, removing dirt and generating new tissue. It mainly treats throat infections, tonsil swelling, scrofula, insect bites, burns, colds, nasal discharge, rhinitis, baldness, carbuncles, toothache, and muscle soreness, and is used for general disinfection. It can also prevent various infectious diseases. It has always been used by Catholics to save and help people without publicity, so few outsiders know about it. However, once used, everyone knows that its efficacy is remarkable. All Catholics must have it at home, and everyone likes to use it. It is sold in the accounts rooms of various Catholic churches, as well as in the Sino-English Dispensary and the Taichang Wood Company.

"Brain Kidney Ting" tonic has always been known for its great tonic power and pure medicinal properties. It can strengthen the brain and kidneys, solidify essence and increase strength. Recently, due to the impact of the war, raw material prices have soared, and it has been extremely difficult to maintain the original price.

### New Contribution to the Medical Field: Yu Fa's Anti-Tuberculosis Drug

Yu , director of the Biological Research Institute of the Xin Ya Factory in Shanghai, is a medical doctor from Harvard University in the United States. He was the Chief Technician and Acting Director of the Central Epidemic Prevention Department and the Director of the Bacteriology Department of the Lester Institute for Medical Research. He is a true expert in bacteriology. Recently, based on his research and crystallization, he invented a special drug for the treatment of tuberculosis, called "Anti-Tuberculosis Element," which has been applied in the Third Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society and other major hospitals, with remarkable effectiveness. It is really a great contribution to the medical field.

Dr. Yu said: "Among children in Shanghai under the age of fourteen, 61% have tuberculosis. Among adults, 100,000 people die each year from tuberculosis, and about 500 people die from tuberculosis each year. This number is the standard of the world, which is really shocking."

When the reporter asked about the types of tuberculosis, Dr. Yu said that there are as many as eight or nine types, such as intestinal tuberculosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, kidney tuberculosis, bone tuberculosis, laryngeal tuberculosis, scrofula cervical tuberculosis, eye and skin tuberculosis. Ordinary patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are the majority, but there are not many patients with laryngeal tuberculosis. Anyone suffering from tuberculosis must have tubercle bacilli in their body. This bacterium can be transmitted to others and invade the lungs, causing pulmonary tuberculosis; invade the bones, causing bone tuberculosis; invade the intestinal tract, skin, kidneys, and lymph nodes, all of which can cause tuberculosis. The tubercle bacilli of pulmonary tuberculosis come out with sputum, and the tubercle bacilli of bone tuberculosis, skin tuberculosis, and scrofula come out with pus. The tubercle bacilli of intestinal tuberculosis come out with feces, and the tubercle bacilli of kidney tuberculosis come out with urine.

"Anti-Tuberculosis Element" has been carefully studied by Dr. Yu and is considered to be a special drug for the treatment of various tuberculosis, with remarkable efficacy. It can radically cure tuberculosis in all stages.

After the reporter had a good chat with Dr. Yu at Xin Ya yesterday and visited the various departments of the institute, he showed the bacteria glass tubes made in the oven, explaining that the temperature in the box is often around 3,000 degrees, allowing the bacteria in the tube to spread and reproduce, and showed the bacteria glass tubes that had been in the oven and those that had not been in the oven, giving detailed explanations.

Scholarship Lecture

### How to Study Botany (II)

— Yuan Shanzheng

(III) How to Study Botany

(A) Research Methods The principles and methods of research are generally the same as those of zoology. I will present some simple and easy-to-implement methods below:

1. Observe carefully at any time and in any place: Plants grow in all seasons, and they differ from season to season. Some grow in the spring and wither in the summer, some grow in the summer and wither in the autumn or winter, and some produce leaves in the spring, bloom in the summer, and bear fruit in the autumn. Once the opportunity has passed, it is difficult to find suitable materials. Therefore, we must study the external morphology, development, and relationship with the environment of plants at any time and in any place to obtain correct knowledge.

2. Use a microscope to observe the internal structure: A microscope is an important tool for studying botany. We cut plant organs such as roots, stems, and leaves into thin slices, place them on glass slides, and observe them carefully under a microscope. Then we can learn about the internal cells and tissues. Lower plants (algae), such as Spirogyra, Closterium, and diatoms, can be directly clipped between glass slides and magnified for observation under a microscope, which is very interesting.

3. Cultivate plants: We must understand the reproduction, growth status, and nutritional physiology of plants. We cannot understand these things without personally cultivating plants. The cultivation place does not need to be large, such as a flower pot in front of the courtyard. Plants such as potato tubers can grow buds from eye-like structures. Transplanting them into the soil can grow new plants. Similarly, seeds such as broad beans or soybeans can germinate and grow when buried in the soil. Tender branches of chrysanthemums or roses can be inserted into the soil and watered daily to grow roots. This can be used to experiment with the reproduction of plants, to observe their growth status, and to save time spent in the wild. Nutrient solutions can also be used to test the relationship between plant nutrition and growth. For example, the lack of potassium or iron will prevent plants from developing fully.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Surged Before Noon

English Exchange Rate Reached Unprecedented High, Closing Rate Stabilized

HSBC Gradually Supplied US Dollars, Speculative Surge Halted

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC listed at 9:30 AM, the English exchange rate shrank by 1875, appearing at an unprecedented high of 2 pence 8125. The US exchange rate shrank by 625, reaching 4.6875 yuan. There were no markets for French, German, and Japanese currencies. The exchange rates for Indian and Hong Kong currencies also shrank sharply. The English-US exchange rate in the gray market tightened first and then fell. After opening in the morning, Chinese merchants initially bought US dollars at 4.8125 and 4.75 yuan, which were difficult to obtain. Import foreign firms also settled their accounts. It was heard that Japanese banks were making up for losses, so the US exchange rate at HSBC's small counter shrank to 4.6875 yuan, so it also tightened to the same level as the higher price. The English gold price also saw a new high of 2 pence 8125. Around 9:45 AM, it was heard that HSBC was supplying US dollars at 4.75 yuan, halting the speculative surge. American banks also supplied US dollars, so the exchange rate gradually recovered, reaching 4.8125 yuan for US dollars, finally matching the English exchange rate. The US exchange rate tightened slightly, and transactions became sparse. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Japanese Merchants Speculated Simultaneously

Since the morning, foreign telegrams indicated that the English-US exchange rates in the silver market had not changed. Exchange rates between various countries and Shanghai shrank by 0.0625 for English currency and 0.01 for US currency, while the rest remained stable. The central listing price was stable for all exchange rates. The opening selling prices of banks in the domestic market were 2 pence 84375 for English currency and 4.8125 yuan for US dollars, both the same as the closing prices of the previous day. It was heard that Japanese banks were still secretly buying, and importers and speculators were also competing to buy at 4.8125 yuan and 4.75 yuan. Banks were reluctant to supply. HSBC's listing price shrank, and the silver balance tax was still 224.25%. The US exchange rate at the small counter also shrank to 4.6875 yuan, so banks were only willing to supply at the higher price. The English gold price also tightened to 2 pence 8125. It was heard that HSBC was offering to sell August US dollars at 4.75 yuan, and American banks were also becoming more willing to supply, ending the speculative surge. An American bank sold August US dollars at 4.78125 yuan to an importer. The exchange rate then fell back to 4.8125 yuan for sale. The English gold price also saw a recovery. At noon, the spot price for both current and September English exchange rates was 2 pence 84375, and the US exchange rate was 4.78125 yuan (some were also willing to sell at 4.8125 yuan), which was the same as the previous day for English currency and 0.03125 tighter for US currency.

Tianjin's English and US Currencies Tightened Consistently

Tianjin, 9th (Saturday) Telegram: The exchange rate market opened sluggish this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate tightened by 0.125 to 3 pence 3125. The New York telegraphic transfer rate shrank by 0.25 to 5.5625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 0.75 yuan to 86.50 yuan. The "Lianchao" gray market price rose by 0.25 yuan to 55.25 yuan.

### Gold Prices Fluctuated Repeatedly: Dangerous Gold Rush

After Reaching High Price of 7220 Yuan, Confidence in Upward Trend Began to Waver

Yesterday's gray market for gold, despite being a half-day business on Saturday morning, was still treacherous. It started with a sharp rise, followed by a sudden fall. After reaching the 7,200 yuan mark, it quickly retreated, causing the confidence of those betting on an upward trend to waver. After opening in the morning, due to the expectation that Hong Kong telegraphic transfers would not arrive and the suspicion that HSBC would stop listing prices, foreign exchange banks in the city were reluctant to supply, leading to a sharp tightening. Some Shanghai West groups speculated, and Lintai rushed to buy 10,000 taels. Securities firms, gold firms, and silver firms also absorbed gold, so the price soared to a new high of 7,220 yuan amid widespread speculation. Later, it was heard that HSBC was listing prices as usual and selling US dollars at 4.75 yuan, which stabilized market sentiment. The bulls were greatly disappointed, and gold firms such as Chengji and Hesheng dumped their holdings. Another Shanghai West group increased their sales, and securities firms also re-entered the market, causing the price to fall quickly to around 7,100 yuan. Ultimately, the price still rose by 68 yuan. The volume of transactions for the day was 130,000 to 140,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Cash transactions were rare. Yida sold 40 taels, jewelry stores sold 20 taels, and Shunyuan sold 10 taels. The price then reached an unprecedented high of 8,880 yuan, a further increase of 80 yuan, causing jewelry prices to also reach a new high of 910 yuan, a price never seen since listing.

Futures Prices Have Risen for Five Consecutive Days

The opening price for each bar (10 taels) this morning at 9:15 AM was 7,090 yuan, 25 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. The price bottomed out at 7,080 yuan. Suddenly, favorable rumors spread, and Lintai, Yida, Xianghe, Hengji, Yiyuan, Shihe, Decheng, and retail investors rushed to buy, causing the price to soar past 7,100 yuan and then 7,200 yuan, an increase of 140 yuan. The price reached a high of 7,220 yuan. Later, it was heard that the US exchange rate had stopped tightening and that HSBC had sold US dollars, which stabilized market sentiment. Chengji, Defu, Yida, Dingsheng, Dafeng, and Hesheng began to sell, causing the price to fall sharply. When it was heard that US dollars could be settled at 4.8125 yuan, Xiangxingyong, Mingfeng, Xinfengyong, and Yiyuan also competed to sell. The Shanghai West group increased their sales, and the price fell back by 140 yuan to 7,080 yuan. At that time, Lintai came in to buy again, and Chida, Yida, and Xinfengyong also purchased. The US exchange rate softened slightly, and the price rose by 100 yuan to 7,180 yuan. Defu, Hesheng, and Chengji sold again, and the price fell to 7,110 yuan. The Russian fathers raised the price. The noon closing price was 7,133 yuan, a further increase of 68 yuan compared to the previous day. The price has risen for five consecutive days, for a total increase of 452 yuan. The settlement price for August US dollars was 4.78125 yuan, which was 7,283 yuan, an increase of 150 yuan. After closing, the price rose to 7,142 yuan and then fell back to 7,125 yuan. There was a difference of 140 yuan between the high and low prices during the half-day period. There were no reports of open trading in the afternoon. The retail price of gold at cash stores was 8,950 yuan, with a reduction of 200 yuan for buybacks. There was no market for current margin calls.

Jewelry Prices Reach 910 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry at jewelry stores, such as Datongxing and Xintongxing, rose by 10 yuan at 10:00 AM, reaching 910 yuan, with a reduction of 40 yuan for buybacks.

### US Dollar Opened High at 21 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw both current and futures prices for silver and gold rise sharply. English and US gold pounds also continued to rise by 5 yuan. The trend of English gold notes was firm, and the market price remained stable. The US dollar note opened at 2,035 yuan. After opening, Rentaiyong and Zhicheng purchased, raising the price to 70 yuan. United, Shunyuan, Zhenhe, Xiangyuan, and Yongliji sold, lowering the price to 30 yuan. Yintai and Tongxing purchased, raising the price again to 45 yuan. The noon closing price was 2,042 yuan, an increase of 16 yuan compared to the previous day. The spot price rose to 21 yuan. The trend of Hong Kong notes was increasingly popular, with the evening price reaching 5.65 yuan. The Japanese gold note remained stable, with the evening price still at the original 2.3 yuan. The trend of Korean notes continued to rise, with the evening price reaching 1.84 yuan.

### Grains: Due to Delicate Sino-Thai Relations, Foreign Rice is Stirring Up Trouble Again

Yesterday, the upward trend of foreign rice became more intense. Both futures and spot rice prices rose sharply. The hoarding merchants originally hoped for good news, and the sharp shrinkage of exchange rates and the tightening of Thai-Japanese relations stimulated the merchants' excitement. The "throwing the top hat" and "kicking the ball" types emerged in response to the times, taking the opportunity to become active. The trend of the previous day ended, and the tide receded from the market. Domestic and foreign merchants, as well as shops in this street, inquired about prices, and the atmosphere in the market became tense. Buying voices were boiling, and market prices rose higher and higher. Spot Xiaojiao rice rose to 126 yuan, No. 1 Saigon rice reached 137.5 yuan, No. 2 rice reached 126.5 yuan, and broken rice reached 97 yuan. No. 1 Siamese and Mindang rice opened at 130 yuan, and Huowen rice reached 133.5 yuan. Trading at the Yinghua Company was also quite active, with Xiaojiao rice reaching 153 yuan, broken rice reaching 109.5 yuan, and No. 2 Siamese rice reaching 143.5 yuan, a sharp increase of 3-5 yuan compared to the previous day. It was later heard that Xinchangsheng had sold 1,000 tons of Xiaojiao rice ready for shipment at a price of only 150 yuan, but the actual sales were sluggish. Merchants became timid and withdrew, and the market immediately reversed and fell, with a sharp drop of 1-3 yuan. However, the prices were still higher than the closing prices of the previous day by 1-2 yuan. Xiaojiao rice at Yinghua Company (1 stone, 2.5 dou) fell from 152.5 yuan to 151.6 yuan to 151 yuan. No. 2 Siamese rice fell from 142.5 yuan to 142 yuan to 141.3 yuan. Spot Xiaojiao rice returned to 123.5 yuan. The total transaction volume for spot rice was 20,000 bags, and for Yinghua Company rice, it was 1,200 tons. The closing prices for spot rice were: No. 1 Saigon rice at 136 yuan, Central rice at 133-134 yuan, No. 2 rice at 124.5 yuan, 124 yuan, and high at 126.5 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice at 124 yuan, Mindang rice at 140 yuan, Central rice at 131 yuan, 130 yuan, fixed at 126-127 yuan, Jiafo rice at 131.5 yuan, 131 yuan, Yinhangzhan Xiaowen rice at 124 yuan, Waizhan rice at 123 yuan, and Tokyo Jianjian rice at 116 yuan. Broken rice rose from 96 yuan to 91 yuan.

Due to the scarcity of thick and thin japonica rice, and the repeated increase in foreign rice prices, the market sentiment uniformly trended upward, and prices rose by 2 yuan. Early and late rice from Kainan Port was priced at 153.5 yuan to 150 yuan. Wuxi original-packed white japonica rice was priced at 147 yuan. Pudong new japonica rice was even higher due to its seasonal freshness, so despite its softer texture, it also increased by 2 yuan, with a transaction volume of 6 dans and a price of 159 yuan.

Due to the long-term shortage of domestic glutinous rice, the market inventory was also depleted. Hong Kong white yuan rice, following the lead of foreign rice, also increased by about 2 yuan, opening high at 126 yuan, followed by yellow rice at 120 yuan, and glutinous green rice at 115 yuan to 113 yuan.

### Flour Prices Followed Suit Quickly

Yesterday's spot market for foreign flour saw a sharp rise. On the sales side, after the price of rice and noodles in Tianjin rose, the North China merchants' appetite gradually increased. The news of Japan's southward advance resurfaced, and market sentiment was booming. Under the competition between domestic sales and scattered hoarding, Jinlong flour opened at 32.5 yuan and rose to 32.8 yuan, while Fort flour was at 33.9 yuan and Bell Tower flour was at 34.45 yuan, an increase of nearly 1 yuan compared to the previous day. There were also miscellaneous brands such as Fish and Bird at 32.8 yuan and Banana brand at 33 yuan. The market unanimously trended upward. However, the situation eased in the afternoon due to some merchants selling off their holdings. Jinlong flour retreated to 31.6 yuan and 31.5 yuan. Other goods were still competing. The market outlook was not optimistic due to the rapid increase in prices.

Due to the impact of wind and rain, the supply of wheat was scarce. Although Japanese and Chinese flour mills released prices for purchases, there was no corresponding spot supply. It was heard that Japanese mills were receiving about 200-300 bags per day at their retail outlets, while Chinese mills had almost no supply. The purchase prices of the mills remained unchanged.

### Yarn & Cotton: Factory Yarn Occasionally Sold Off; Despite High Prices, Japanese Yarn Still Struggled to Rise

The yarn market initially rose and then fell, but the situation was chaotic. This was due to inconsistent market sentiment. At the same time, the trading volume of spot yarn was not as high as the previous day. Although foreign exchange rates shrank and margin calls rose, yarn prices did not rise accordingly. In fact, the environment was unfavorable. Factories occasionally sold off, and industry sentiment tended towards selling short for Shuangma yarn. However, securities firms and gold firms were in long positions, and the pull of both sides seemed to be strong. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,625 yuan, and the low price was 1,593 yuan. The market closed in the afternoon due to the usual weekend closure. The current yarn market was still in consolidation. Considering the raw materials, yarn prices could not be loose. According to market sentiment, most people were bearish due to the occasional sell-off by factories, which greatly impacted the market. However, the price of Japanese yarn was very high, and outsiders occasionally absorbed it.

The opening momentum of Shuangma yarn was stable. As some holders took profits, the opening price was 1,615 yuan. Then, it was heard that foreign exchange rates had shrunk and margin calls had risen, and market sentiment improved, rising to 1,625 yuan. However, sales were not strong, and gold prices fell slightly, causing the market to loosen and fall to 1,605 yuan. Short covering caused the price to rise back to 1,614 yuan. Towards the close, the price suddenly fell due to the factory selling off, making the market sentiment weak, and the closing price was 1,593 yuan. The transaction volume during the half-day period was 7,125 bales. The sales volume of each group is listed below:

Hong Kong 125 bales, fellow traders 7,000 bales, totaling 7,125 bales

The Shuangma futures yarn market saw erratic ups and downs, and the trend was chaotic. Although US cotton continued to fall, the spot yarn market was strong, and market sentiment was strong when the market opened in the morning. Therefore, it continued the upward trend of the previous day and rose again. The opening price for August futures was 1,472 yuan, a sharp increase of 3 yuan. Afterwards, it continued to rise, reaching a high of 1,480 yuan. The opening price for September futures was 1,555 yuan, up 8 yuan, and reached a high of 1,560 yuan. The opening price for October futures was 1,565 yuan, and the high price was traded. Therefore, due to the softening of the gold market and the spot yarn market, the bulls began to fluctuate and sold off their holdings. As expected, the market fell back. As a result, the closing prices were 1,465 yuan for August futures, 1,535 yuan for September futures, and 1,549 yuan for October futures, a decrease of 4-15 yuan. In summary, if the spot yarn market is not actively sold, the futures yarn market will also be difficult to remain strong. However, the foreign exchange and gold markets have many fluctuations, so changes in the yarn market may fluctuate accordingly. However, considering the relationship with actual sales, the potential for upward movement may be less than the downward momentum. The total transaction volume for the half-day period yesterday was 8,520 bales, a decrease of 5,160 bales compared to the previous day. As of the 8th, the stock balance for the past three months was 24,550 bales, including 6,500 bales for August, 9,220 bales for September, and 8,830 bales for October. Sellers included 4,580 bales short by No. 2, 2,380 bales short by No. 16, 1,550 bales short by No. 67, 1,150 bales short by No. 52, and 1,050 bales short by No. 61. Buyers included 1,080 bales long by No. 58, 970 bales long by No. 14, 930 bales long by No. 5, 810 bales long by No. 7, and 740 bales long by No. 35. The market prices for the entire day are listed in the table below:

### US Government: Reduced Cotton Production Report

Washington Telegram: The US Department of Agriculture's Cotton Production Report announced that the estimated US cotton harvest for the first season this year is 10,817,000 bales, a decrease of 612,000 bales compared to the same period last year. The percentage condition is 72 points for normal years, and the yield per acre is 224.4 pounds. The relevant situation for the same period in the past five years is recorded in the original telegram on the left (unit: thousands of bales, 500 pounds per bale).

The US cotton statistics from August 1st to 8th this year are also recorded in the telegram on the left (500 pounds per bale).

### Cotton Merchants Hoarding: Transactions Sharply Reduced

Although the spot cotton situation is strong, consumption is weak, and market sentiment is quite firm. Holders are not willing to sell temporarily, and those who intend to sell are asking for very high prices. As foreign exchange rates have shrunk, the converted price has naturally increased. However, there are still few buyers, and transactions have become thin.

Another report from Shanghai foreign firms on foreign cotton order transactions indicates that the market situation is still strong and prices are high, and market sentiment is excited. At the same time, various parties are actively gathering spot goods, but due to hoarding by holders and excessive price increases, the number of transactions in recent days has remained low.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to selling pressure, then rebounded due to the unfavorable field report for shorts, but finally fell again due to profit-taking by longs and selling by Southern firms. As a result, the closing price fell by 7-9 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market continued to be suspended, but evening off-market transactions were slightly weaker due to speculative buying and profit-taking by longs. The final price fell by about 4 rupees compared to the previous day. The forecast for the market opening today is an increase of 0.75 rupees.

### Securities: Unstable Bond Market, Spinning in Circles

The gray market for public bonds remained weak yesterday. However, Gongmao and Tianyu absorbed types A and B, causing them to rebound by 0.3-0.5 yuan. The market was sluggish, and transactions were thin, in stark contrast to Shuangma and gold. It can be seen that public bonds focus on investment and are more stable, while speculators tend to flock to gold and Shuangma yarn. Yesterday was Saturday, and paper transactions were only conducted in the morning. Gongmao actively bought types A and B, and Tianyu exclusively bought type B. Jiucheng, Tongkang, and Jiufeng all had some intake. Xiexing, Yuanlian, Xinhua, Renchang supplied in succession. The trend remained in a spin and was not easy to develop in the near term. As the first payment of principal and interest due at the end of July had not yet been received, market sentiment was worried. As a result, prices for types A and B rose by 0.3-0.55 yuan, types C and E fell by 0.1-0.3 yuan, and no transactions were made for type D. The total transaction volume was about 800,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

### Piece Goods: Varied Colors and Whitewares, Uneven Cloth Bottom

The factory cloth market trend was firm yesterday. Sales in Guangdong and Hong Kong were good. However, due to the tense situation in the Pacific, there was a wait-and-see attitude. As the raw material of fine yarn rose sharply, the opening price of poplin and flannel continued to rise by 0.5-1 yuan. Colored cloth and colored twill rose by 0.25-0.5 yuan. Some whitewares, coarse and fine cloth, and twill increased by 0.3-0.5 yuan. The street traded more than 500 pieces of various cloths. Guangdong and Hong Kong traded more than 500 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Nanyang traded more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, khaki, and bleached twill.

The Eastern cloth whitewares are slacker, and the colored goods are still strong. The fine cloth for all months on the exchange fell by 0.14-0.35 yuan per piece. The single order from the leading factory in the spot market opened strong in the morning, with the high price selling at 53.8 yuan. As the price of yarn fell, it turned to a decline. The closing price at noon was 53.25 yuan, equal to the market price of the previous day. The price of colored goods increased because the prices of fine yarn, dyeing, finishing, and other items had increased. Market sentiment was trending upward, and the opening price rose sharply by 0.02 yuan per yard. The price fell in the middle due to the price drop on the exchange, but it recovered at the close. The new single new tax for Sijunzi cloth was 1.755 yuan, the new single old tax was 1.745 yuan, and the old single old tax was 1.695 yuan.

### Oil Market: Oil Merchants Hoard and Manipulate Prices, Edible Oil Reaches New Highs Repeatedly

Yesterday, Prices Rose Again by Five to Ten Dollars

Yesterday, the surge in edible oil prices intensified again. The oil merchants are trying to imitate rice dealers, seeking to make exorbitant profits, manipulating the market, and hoarding goods without any scruples. Prices are being driven up one after another, like a race, repeatedly setting new records, which is causing hardship for the common people and increasing the burden on their lives. It is reported that 40 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were sold at a record high of 272 yuan. 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were sold for 170 yuan to 272 yuan. 60 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at 190 yuan, and 70 pieces of soybean oil were priced at 190 yuan. 150 dan of Dalian soybean oil were priced at 210 yuan. 1,000 dan of clear oil were priced at 170 yuan to 181.5 yuan. 600 dan of rapeseed oil were priced at 185 yuan to 187 yuan. More than 1,000 dan of Japanese rapeseed oil were priced at 175 yuan to 182 yuan, a huge increase of five to ten yuan compared to the previous day.

### Sugar Market: Tianjin Merchants Scour for Dutch Red Sugar, Price Increase is Particularly Large

Yesterday, the sugar market saw coarse white sugar still absorbed due to good public sentiment. The tight supply showed no signs of weakening, and prices rose by another two to three yuan. Dutch red sugar, however, saw a larger price increase due to the insufficient supply and Tianjin merchants scrambling to buy it. The company's forward coarse white sugar for delivery on August 10th was initially priced at 113.2 yuan, then rose to 115 yuan to 114.2 yuan, before falling back to 113.5 yuan, an increase of 1.8 yuan. The end of August opened at 116.8 yuan, reaching 117.5 yuan, before settling at 115.8 yuan to 115.1 yuan. The association's spot price for second-grade coarse white sugar for July delivery was 114.5 yuan to 114 yuan, an increase of 3.5 yuan. June was 114 yuan, 113 yuan, 112.5 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan. May was 113 yuan to 112 yuan, with the same increase. April was 112 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. March was 111.5 yuan. Dutch red sugar KD brand was 105 yuan to 106 yuan, a sharp increase of 6 yuan. Taikoo refined white B brand was 136 yuan to 137 yuan. HX brand was 116.5 yuan to 117 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan from the previous day's asking price. H brand red sugar was 100 yuan, an increase of 12 yuan from the 7th.

Children's Weekly

### Movies and Children's Education

— Ru Bing

Modern film art has already achieved a considerable status in the cultural world, which is an undeniable fact. We believe that this kind of "audio-visual textbook" is indeed the best educational tool, and its influence on children is even more closely related. Adults watch movies purely for entertainment or to receive some extremely beneficial education in their minds, but the influence they receive in terms of psychology and knowledge is certainly also profound.

As for children watching movies, in addition to entertainment, they also receive a great educational effect. Fairy tales, fables, and stories are certainly gifts to children, but after they are "cinematized," the interest given to children will be even stronger, and the influence will be even more profound.

Many children in Shanghai love movies, but the subject matter of current movies mostly lacks meaning and is not suitable for children to watch, because these films are harmful to their psychology and physiology.

According to the results of tests, children like slapstick comedies the most. Specifically, boys like: 1. Martial arts films, 2. Detective films, 3. Slapstick comedies, 4. Adventure films. Girls like: 1. Slapstick comedies, 2. Adventure films, 3. Detective films, 4. Martial arts films. What they have in common is that they like slapstick comedies. As for literary and artistic films and biographical films, they are not welcome at all because their level of knowledge is not sufficient.

Cartoons can be said to be very popular among children, such as "Snow White," "Gulliver's Travels," and "Pinocchio." They are all extremely interesting and colorful cartoons that arouse their strong interest and a sense of the beauty of colors, which are beneficial to their psychological knowledge.

What is most undesirable are some horror films and supernatural films, etc., which stimulate children when they watch them, causing them to be unable to fall asleep at night or have nightmares after sleeping. It is best not to let children watch this kind of film to avoid accidents. Therefore, making interesting educational films is a matter of urgency.

In addition to improving the films, the seats and lighting in theaters should also be reformed, because inaccurate angles and unsuitable distances often damage children's eyesight, and some even become nearsighted as a result. These shortcomings that endanger children's physiology also need to be improved urgently.

### Smart and Brave Will

— Yao Yao

During the last European War, there was a French elementary school student named Will. At that time, he was only eleven years old and lived with his mother in a village called Henry near Paris. Because he was very smart and willing to work hard, he was not only praised at school but also often received candy rewards from his mother when he returned home.

One early morning, a group of disorganized and panicky defeated soldiers suddenly came to Henry Village. The number was more than sixty. They poured in like crows returning to their nests, and they were all in a sorry state, without guns or cannons. The German army behind them was encircling them in a semi-circular formation. Behind the village was a wide river, and the bridge over the river had already been blown up. There was no boat in the river. How could these six thousand soldiers cross? While everyone was in a panic, a child suddenly stood up and said loudly to the crowd:

"It's very dangerous now. You must quickly build a bridge! There is still a lot of wood here that can be used. As for the pursuers behind, I will try to stop them. The sooner, the better!" Although he was just a child, his tone of voice was like that of an adult. After he finished speaking, he quickly ran straight to the German army's location, holding a white flag in his hand.

He was taken into the camp by a German soldier.

"How old are you this year?" asked a man who looked like an officer.

"Eleven years old."

"What are you doing here alone? Aren't you afraid?" The officer's French was not very good.

"I am here on behalf of our soldiers to surrender."

"I don't believe it. Why did you send this little child here?"

"The people in our village have all fled, and the soldiers have not eaten anything for three days and three nights. They are eating now, so there is no one else besides me." After saying that, the officer ran up a mound and looked into the distance with binoculars. Sure enough, there were many dark figures moving. So he ran down again and said to the child, "You just sit here and wait for them to finish eating. Then you lead them here, understand?" "Understood, you go." The child sat there.

After a while, the officer rushed in fiercely and asked, "What's going on?" The child replied, "They have probably all fled, escaping over a simple bridge." "Bah! Spy!" Before he finished speaking, the tip of a bayonet had pierced the child's throat, and blood splattered everywhere.

Children! He was the smart and brave Will!

### Writing Letters

— Yang Yi

Children! Don't you often have letters coming and going? Or a neighbor brings a letter and asks you to read it to them, and sometimes even asks your father to write a letter for them. Children, do you read and write letters? If you can't, why don't you learn?

When you do compositions at school, the teacher gives a topic, and you often can't do it? Some children make up things to write on paper. If the topic is "A Letter to Dad" or "A Letter to Brother," it's really hard to do, because you see Dad every day and there's really nothing to say. And maybe you don't even have a brother?

Writing letters is really necessary! It can practice your writing ability. Many things you want to say can be turned into words. It can also connect feelings, like with your teacher, classmates, or relatives in faraway places. If you write a letter to them, they will be very happy and rush to write back to you.

How do you write your letter? Start with a salutation, like Mr. ××, Academic Brother ××, Cousin ××... Then say whatever you want to say, like two people talking, asking about their health, whether their studies are improving... If you are writing to someone who is more knowledgeable than you, you can also ask them to correct and guide your mistakes.

Like in the old-fashioned way of writing letters, you have to use phrases like "Respectfully submitted to your knees" when writing to parents, or "Big seal, hereby opening" to peers. We beginners don't need to use that. Regarding the method of writing letters, children can refer to books on writing letters.

Children, why don't you give it a try? Writing letters is composition with a target, and it won't be boring. I wish you success.

### Watermelon Lantern

— Zhang Mengzhao

Only a quarter of the long summer vacation has passed, and there are still three-quarters of the time coming slowly. Children, during this summer vacation, the work that you find most interesting is drawing, silhouette cutting (collage), paper folding, and various woodworking projects with bamboo and wood, etc. It seems to be more energetic than doing repetitive homework like reading and writing. The reason is that children's personalities are mostly active. Now, the author will write down some methods for making "watermelon lanterns" and introduce them to you children: Watermelon is the most seasonal cold drink right now. In addition to adding salt and sun-drying the leftover watermelon rinds and stir-frying them for meals, the craft of making "watermelon lanterns" is also excellent.

The method of making watermelon lanterns is not difficult, it is very simple. First, take a watermelon (it is best to use a "three-white watermelon" with white seeds, white flesh, and white skin) and cut off a small half (about one-third) of the watermelon lid at the vine. Then, dig out the watermelon pulp and seeds. Then, scrape the watermelon skin with a copper spoon or enamel spoon until it is very thin, making the skin thin and transparent, emitting a green and shiny luster (note that the watermelon skin should not be scraped too thin to prevent it from being punctured). After the first step is completed, the second step is to cut thick cardboard into a circular shape (about the size of an old silver coin) to make two candle base plates. String them with thick lead wire and clamp them inside and outside the bottom of the watermelon. At the same time, use thick tin wire to make a candle holder about an inch long at the center of the candle base plate. After this work is completed, the third step is to draw landscapes, flowers, figures, or animals, insects, or draw the image of the founding father Sun Yat-sen, or draw the images of the great men of the world's democracies today, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, etc. around the watermelon shell with a light ink brush, as desired, to make them as lifelike as possible. If you want to keep it simple, you can also draw plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and rocks... After finishing well, then take a sharp foot knife and gently carve along the brush strokes to reveal a more transparent image. Then, thread lead wire around the edge of the watermelon top, hang it up in a triangular pattern, and at night, light a small white paraffin candle or a small red candle and insert it into the candle holder at the bottom of the watermelon. A watermelon lantern is complete. It is so small and exquisite, so green, and the shadows of people flicker. It really feels clear and lovely! I remember when I was a child, my late cousin Ran Qianjun was the most skilled in this art. He painted well and carved skillfully, and he was praised by his parents. If this small craft of making "watermelon lanterns" can be made with ingenuity and promoted, I think a "watermelon lantern" will definitely occupy a hundred seats in the toy market in the summer, selling at a good price, and it will be another small craft business of "prosperous business and making money."

### Steamed Buns

— Jin Zhen

Because the price of rice has soared to more than 100 yuan per dan, Ah Hui's family bought a few bags of flour as a substitute for rice, so that the consumption of rice can be reduced, which means saving some expenses. Indeed, in this year of expensive rice, everything is being "mined," striving to save to the lowest limit.

Today, Ah Hui's family is making steamed buns again. In the morning, his mother brought back a piece of yeast when she bought groceries. It was wrapped in tin foil, and the color of the yeast was grayish-white, looking like a piece of mushroom tofu.

"Brother, what is yeast? What is it made of?" Ah Hui heard his mother saying: This is a piece of yeast. These two strange and new names made no impression at all in his simple mind. It looked just like a piece of dried tofu. He took it to ask Ah Ming.

"Yeast is a kind of living plant that we cannot see with our eyes. It is composed of countless single-celled plants. Unless you magnify it under a microscope to observe it, you will believe it. Otherwise, you will never believe it. There are good yeasts and bad yeasts. For example, food that has been left overnight is not delicious, and if you put glue for a few days, it will turn yellow-green and moldy, and it will become very smelly. These are all caused by bad yeasts, and the yeasts used to make steamed buns are all beneficial to us. They are as small as about one-thousandth of a centimeter in size. They are colorless, slightly oval-shaped small particles. Although they are very small, their ability to reproduce is very high. How do they produce small yeasts? Because they are a single cell, as long as one single cell is divided into two, it becomes two new cells, so the size and shape of the small yeast are exactly the same as the old yeast. They are not like mother and child, but like a pair of twins. Then two divides into four, four divides into eight, eight divides into sixteen, sixteen divides into thirty-two,... the more they divide, the more there are, until they divide into an unknown number. If the place they live is not very comfortable, they will no longer use this kind of fission reproduction. Instead, they will grow one or two tumor-like things at one end of the old yeast cell. The more they grow, the bigger they get. Later, the tumor-like things become detached from the old cell, and this becomes a new yeast, but it is a little smaller than the original one and looks a bit like mother and child. This is called budding reproduction. This is the general idea about yeast."

Ah Hui didn't ask any more questions, because his mother called him to bring the piece of yeast over. Later, he only saw his mother dissolving the yeast in warm water and mixing it into the flour. After two or three hours, the pile of flour actually "swelled" up. Ah Hui was stunned to see it. At this time, Ah Ming also came over and interrupted his stunned look.

"Brother, look at the ball of flour in the basin. It has now "swelled" into a full basin. Is this the power of yeast? Why can it make the flour "swell"?" Ah Hui asked curiously again.

"Of course, this is entirely the power of yeast. You should know that yeast is a very active plant. When it is dissolved in water and mixed into the flour, you must pay attention that the water for dissolving the yeast cannot be too hot, otherwise the yeast will be scalded to death by the hot water, because they are also living things. When they are mixed into the flour, they feel very stuffy, and they also need to breathe. You should also know that flour is rich in starch, and sugar is made from starch. So when yeast is locked in the flour, when they respire, they decompose the starch and absorb the oxygen in it, and release carbon dioxide gas, which forms many small holes in the flour dough and turns the starch into alcohol. If you don't believe it, smell the swollen flour, and there will definitely be some wine smell. This is the same as our human respiration, so it can be seen that all living things have this respiration. This is also called fermentation, which is very beneficial to us. For example, steamed buns that have not been fermented are hard and not tasty, and they are not easy to digest. Once fermented, everyone welcomes them."

When Ah Ming finished speaking, and Ah Hui carefully observed it, he confirmed that what his brother said was correct. This is Ah Hui's unique scientific spirit. Children, are you also like this?

### Pauline Goddard Talks About Charlie Chaplin

— Qinghui

For several years, the relationship between Charlie Chaplin and Pauline Goddard has always been elusive, and no one can guess whether they are married or not. It was not until "The Great Dictator" was presented at the Broadway "Metropolitan Theater" that Chaplin himself appeared on the stage to meet the audience and introduced Pauline Goddard as "Mrs. Charlie Chaplin." Thus, Pauline Goddard's status was officially confirmed in this sentence. This article is about her talking about Charlie Chaplin as his wife, which is quite unique. It is specially translated to share with readers.

"Marrying Chaplin is like living on top of a constantly erupting volcano." Pauline said contentedly, and her eyes told you that she was very satisfied. "If you want me to describe a good husband, I can simply say that he is not a good husband, but he is an exciting and interesting person. Being with him is a very good marriage for me. Because I like this kind of common life, I like living a dangerous and exciting life. He doesn't know what fear is. He is not afraid of the dangers of life and the dangers of his future career. He is fearless of anything. Sometimes, in the middle of the night or at three or four o'clock in the morning when dawn is approaching, he wakes up and drives to the seaside to watch the sunrise, and then has breakfast there. The crazier he is, the happier he is.

"Ordinary women can get comfort from their husbands," Pauline continued, "but I can't expect Chaplin to give it to me. He is always not punctual. If he says he will be back for dinner at seven o'clock, he will be late until eight or nine o'clock, or he will be back before six o'clock. Therefore, all the food must be prepared in advance, and the cook will bring it out when he enters the door. This way he will be satisfied. He often forgets about appointments, and he doesn't pay attention to income and expenses, although I am not used to these either. But I have to worry about it for him.

"Thinking about others is what he is least good at. He will never remember small things. If I want to get a birthday gift, I have to instruct and choose it myself. He never thinks about sending any souvenirs or gifts like flowers. Christmas is the same. He thinks there should be Christmas, but there is no need to celebrate. He doesn't want any Christmas cards in the house. However, last Christmas was an exception. He gave me a gold chain with a heart pendant, and inside there was a photo of himself. This may be because "The Great Dictator" was a complete success!

"Chaplin seems to think that he is the only person living in the world, thinking that living for sixty more seconds can make up for sixty seconds of travel time." Pauline said with a smile, a smile that came from the heart. "Although he doesn't have eloquent speech, he can write fluently, so he likes to talk to smart and intelligent people. His hobbies are hunting, fishing, reading novels, and paying attention to world news. All his passions are hidden inside. On the surface, he never shows any passionate expressions to you.

Regarding Chaplin, Pauline said shyly, "No one can understand him. Sometimes he is very conservative, but sometimes he is like a naughty bad child. He will make playful and cunning gestures to annoy others, and he also likes to seize on other people's weaknesses and laugh at them. He is also good at lying. You can't tell whether what he says is true or false, but he is not like this about important things. Because he is just joking about unimportant things..."

"Ring! Ring..." It was Chaplin's phone call, so it interrupted her sentence.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan's Small Characters are Delicate Silk

The lyricist then began to write poems in the boat. Yuan Yuan helped him grind the ink. All the way back to Hengtang, the lyricist had already completed twenty poems, truly possessing the talent of Li Bai leaning on his horse. That night, the lyricist ate dinner in Yuan Yuan's boudoir and drank until he was tipsy before taking the boat back to the city. That night, Yuan Yuan dreamed that she was still playing on the mountain. In an instant, she couldn't see the lyricist. Suddenly, a cloud of black clouds surged up in the sky, and the wind howled as if it was about to rain. She was panicking in her heart when she suddenly saw Flower Butterfly leading a group of people running up the mountain from below, holding weapons in their hands, looking like a gang of robbers who wanted to rob her. She was extremely frightened and screamed. When she woke up, it was just a dream of Nanke, and she broke out in a cold sweat. Thinking about this dream, it was very vivid. Then she thought that dreams are born from the heart, which was because she had met Flower Butterfly during the day and was not very happy in her heart, so she had this dream. She barely calmed her mind and went back to sleep. The next morning, the weather suddenly became overcast again, as if it was going to rain. The weather in spring is originally changeable, with uncertain sunny and rainy days, and yesterday and today are very different. After Yuan Yuan got up in the morning, finished washing up, and had lunch, she sat at her desk, took out the drafts of the twenty spring tour poems that the pity jade lyricist had chanted in the boat yesterday, and copied them one by one onto Huanhua paper. Yuan Yuan's small regular script was written very beautifully and neatly, which showed her intelligent and elegant nature. In the afternoon, fine rain was weaving outside the window, and the flowers and trees were all wet. Yuan Yuan guessed that the lyricist would not come today, which was best. No other guests came either, so she could rest. Who knew that in the evening, a distinguished guest suddenly came to her boudoir. When he came, the attendants in front of the door were like clouds, and the momentum was magnificent. The neighbors were all surprised and asked who that distinguished guest was. Yuan Yuan's family members were busy serving the honored guests. But when Yuan Yuan saw the old man, she recognized him as the noble person she had met on Lingyan Mountain yesterday, and she couldn't help but feel a jolt in her heart. What made her even more disgusted was that a young man was following closely behind the old man, who was Flower Butterfly, whom she avoided like poison. (138)

### Drama Notes

— Fen Yu

Ma Zhizhong, the representative of the Huangjin Grand Theater's invitation to actors from the north, set off by plane yesterday. However, the force of the hurricane has not diminished, and the plane circled several times in the clouds before returning to the station and stopping. Therefore, Ma Zhizhong has to reschedule his trip.

### Movie World Miscellany

— Xing

The film "Xifenfei" is doing very well at the box office, which the Guohua authorities also found surprising. Director Zheng Xiaoqiu's technique is clear, beautiful, concise and direct. It is rumored that Guohua will give him an additional reward of 1,000 yuan, which is in fact unprecedented. And Zheng Xiaoqiu's status as a director has indeed risen considerably since the Jin Xing films "The Way of Husband and Wife" and "Fig."

"A chorus of privately funded film productions" – directors, actors, and theater managers… all have such intentions. It is rumored that the film company authorities believe that this trend must not be allowed to spread, because the film companies are suffering significant losses and will persuade and stop them. However, the purpose of some employees' external activities is to compensate for the insufficient regular income. If there are real losses, the film producers will add remuneration as appropriate to reassure them in their original positions.

"Guo Ren Yao", starring Li Zhuozhuo and Wang Yuanlong in Hong Kong, was originally scheduled to be shown at Jincheng Cinema, but it has now been changed to Jindu Cinema, following "Xifenfei."
