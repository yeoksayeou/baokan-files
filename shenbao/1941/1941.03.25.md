### British Troops Rushing from Greece, Concentrating on Yugoslav Border; Yugoslav Cabinet Reorganized, Determined to Adhere to Axis; Turkey Sends Note to Germany, Vowing Resistance if Threatened

Yugoslav Capital – Because Yugoslavia decided to join Germany within 48 hours, British troops yesterday rushed from the weak Greek border, and it is reported that they have arrived at the Yugoslav border south of Vardar. This situation has suddenly become tense. It is said that there are at least 35,000 mechanized troops in the northern region of Salonica, plus Polish troops, Czech troops, and Free French troops. At that time, Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković will set off for Vienna today to sign the treaty of joining the Axis. As for the cabinet turmoil caused by the resignation of two cabinet members, it has apparently eased. (Taiwan Public News Agency Dispatch, 24th)

Yugoslav Capital – After British troops rushed and concentrated on the Yugoslav border, the move of Yugoslavia joining the Axis was thwarted again last night. The authorities had just announced in the morning that the cabinet turmoil had been resolved and that the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were preparing to go to Vienna to sign the treaty. Unexpectedly, another incident occurred, and it is doubtful when Yugoslavia will join the Axis. On the one hand, Yugoslavia is threatened by Germany's "ultimatum", and on the other hand, it is "opened" by Britain, causing rumors to spread, but there are no demonstrations. The patriotic sports organizations broadcasting throughout the country held a meeting yesterday with 54 executives, representing 300,000 members, demanding that the government respect public opinion and sentiment, saying that signing the treaty would infuriate the people of the country. The organization's newspaper urged the government that "everything can be sacrificed, but the honor and freedom of the country cannot be sacrificed." University students belonging to opposition parties, such as the Radical Party, the Democratic Party, the Nationalist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Serbian Peasants' Party, Independence Democrats, have jointly protested to the government. The people of Brein, southern Serbia (2,600 people), who have always been known for being brave and warlike, telegraphed the government that if national freedom is harmed, they will rebel.

The Daily Mail quoted diplomatic sources in the Yugoslav capital as saying that the reason why Yugoslavia has been slow to sign the Tripartite Pact is due to this warning. It is said that "when the warning was issued, the Yugoslav cabinet still wanted to achieve full unity to implement the decision made by the majority on Friday to accept Hitler's demands." (United Press Dispatch, 24th)

Vichy – Diplomatic sources here declared today that the Turkish President recently replied to Hitler's note, saying that although Turkey wants to avoid war in the Balkans, if Turkey's security zone is threatened, Turkey cannot remain inactive.

### Reserve Officers' Meeting Opposes Submission to Germany

Yugoslav Capital – Three Serbian cabinet members resigned on Friday as a sign of opposition to accepting German conditions. Although it is rumored that their three vacancies have been filled, the political turmoil seems far from being resolved. The decision on whether or not Yugoslavia will compromise with Germany is still undecided. It is said that a special train has been fired up and is ready to carry Yugoslav executives to Vienna at any time, but whether this trip will materialize is still undecided. At the same time, the Association of Reserve Officers of Yugoslavia held a meeting and unanimously passed a proposal opposing any plan to conclude an agreement that is incompatible with national honor and independence. This proposal has been sent to the regents and the prime minister. After passing this proposal, the reserve officers adjourned the meeting without discussing other matters, indicating that this meeting was specifically held to oppose compromise with Germany. Some sources mistakenly reported that this association had been dissolved, but this is not the case. The officers who attended simply refused to continue the meeting. According to German news agency sources, Prince Regent Paul met with the Prime Minister yesterday, and the Prime Minister reported on the situation of talks with various political figures in recent days and proposed candidates to fill the three vacancies in the cabinet. According to Yugoslav official news agency sources, former Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović has requested an exit passport and is departing for Greece according to his own wishes. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)

Belgrade – Despite public resentment and the concentration of British troops near the Yugoslav border in the Vardar River basin, the Yugoslav government seems to have decided today to join the Tripartite Pact. Observers believe that if the government joins the Axis, accidents may occur. There is another party here that opposes the signing of the Tripartite Pact, namely the Serbian Orthodox Church. The history of this church is closely related to the struggle of the Serbian people for freedom under Turkish rule. At that time, the church was the only treasure of Serbian customs. (United Press Dispatch, 24th)

Yugoslav Capital – Anti-German demonstrations in Yugoslavia are spreading wider and wider, and there have been bomb incidents, so Yugoslavia is now on the verge of civil strife. The first bomb incident occurred in the town of Susak, near the Italian border, when some pro-fascist and anti-Serbian party members threw a bomb at the monument to the Yugoslav national hero Peter I, destroying half of his statue. Yesterday, thousands of people demonstrated in the capital and other cities, as well as in many villages, demanding the maintenance of Yugoslav independence and integrity, even if it meant fighting Germany. The public unrest is increasing. (International Dispatch, 24th)

### Once Foreign Troops Enter, Promises Become Meaningless

London – Turkish Radio last night broadcast the views of the Turkish newspaper Marous, saying that although the resignation of the three Yugoslav cabinet members indicates that the agreement has not been completely successful, the Serbian people and military leaders will never allow pro-German elements to act arbitrarily, knowing that once foreign troops enter the country, the promises written in black and white will eventually become meaningless. Therefore, Yugoslavia is still strengthening its army. It is certain that the Yugoslav army will not allow Yugoslav territory to be used as a tool in any conspiracy that is detrimental to the Greek army. The stronger the German pressure, the more obvious the Yugoslav resistance. This is especially evident in the Yugoslav newspapers' arguments against sacrificing national sovereignty and independence. British officials in Cairo recently stated that there are several factors that should encourage Yugoslavia to take a firm stand in dealing with German demands. First, the resignation of the three Yugoslav cabinet members to protest the compromise with Germany has been praised by the entire Yugoslav nation. The Yugoslav government cannot ignore this public opinion. Second, the talks between British and Turkish diplomats in Cyprus, which expressed the consensus of British and Turkish opinions, should also be considered by the Yugoslav government. Third, the material and military assistance and naval and air support provided by Britain to Greece can also be extended to Yugoslavia in the event of an attack on Yugoslavia. This should also be taken into account by the Yugoslav government. Fourth, Germany is now gradually aware that the position of the Italian army in East Africa is becoming increasingly difficult, so the military adventurousness in the Balkans has greatly increased. The Yugoslav government must have seen this kind of panic within Germany. Based on the above reasons, it can be seen that for the benefit of Yugoslavia and its neighbors, the path Yugoslavia must take is to emulate Greece and Turkey in firmly rejecting German threats.

### Philippine Reporter Observes that the U.S. Will Not Abandon the Philippine Islands; Pacific Defenses Have Been Greatly Strengthened; The Purpose Is Clearly to Prevent Asian Aggression

Manila – The Manila Bulletin issued a special edition today to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the newspaper. The newspaper's news editor, Wells, wrote an article saying that senior officials believe that if a crisis occurs in the Philippine Islands, the United States is capable and willing to protect the Philippine Islands. Wells has traveled to the United States for several months and met with President Roosevelt and many other officials. He recently returned to Manila via Pan American Airlines. The most important observation Wells gained from flying across the Pacific was the rapid construction of new airfields on Wake Island and Midway Island. These airfields can accommodate Flying Fortresses flying from the United States to the Philippines and can serve as bases for long-range bombers. This can prevent Tokyo from wanting to divert its naval and air power south because Japan believes that its country can be destroyed by American bombers. Wells said that using intercontinental aircraft can travel farther, have higher speeds, and carry more bombs. Therefore, if war breaks out between Japan and the United States, the striking power of the United States can be enhanced. American military views have gained two arguments: first, if Japan advances south, it must conquer or blockade the Philippines; second, if Japan declares war on the United States in accordance with the provisions of the Axis Pact, the Philippines, as a U.S. territory, is the first and easiest to be attacked. Therefore, the United States is now strengthening its entire defense in the Pacific. Wells also said that there are two different concepts in the United States, which is quite touching. One is that the announcements of the Washington administration may herald a fundamental and permanent conflict between the United States and Japan. The other is that the United States has huge reserves in financial resources, manpower, and economic power. Therefore, a country in the same position as Japan would not wage war against the United States, which is tantamount to suicide. Japan does not want to fight, but Japanese leaders have declared that the United States denies Japan's right to exist, and they also say that the only way to avoid war is for Japan to abandon its goals. Therefore, many Japanese people believe that even if war with the United States is tantamount to suicide, they are willing to do so. Wells also said that the position of isolationist sovereignty has lost much ground. In just one year, American public opinion has shifted from trying to avoid international involvement to being happy to get involved in the whirlpool of other countries. Americans are not yet willing to fully admit this change, but they are flowing into the change without realizing it. If the United States still has no Far East policy, then it is wrong. In fact, this policy has become increasingly clear. The government has任　使使 the United States to devote itself to defense preparations, the scale and cost of which are greater than any country in war. The actual number of the budget is 350 million U.S. dollars. The main fleet of the United States is in the Pacific. The government's purpose is to make the United States prevent Asian aggression so as not to endanger its territorial interests. Wells concluded that, according to the most difficult opinions to communicate, war between the United States and Japan is not inevitable at present, but there is indeed a possibility of war.

(TASS Dispatch, 24th)

Moscow – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived here at 3:30 p.m. yesterday and is temporarily staying at the Soviet government's guest house. He will transfer to Berlin tonight. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, will host a banquet in the evening. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 24th)

Moscow – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived here yesterday afternoon en route to Berlin. Diplomats from all countries that have joined the Axis Pact came to the station to greet him. Because of the severe wind and snow in the past two days, Matsuoka's arrival was delayed by two hours. German Ambassador Schulenburg arrived at the station later and apologized to Matsuoka in English. Matsuoka will visit Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today and is scheduled to depart for Berlin and Rome tonight. Japanese sources here expect that Matsuoka will return to Japan via Moscow on April 16. When Matsuoka met with foreign reporters, he said that if he does not personally discuss matters with the German and Italian leaders, the entire course of Japanese foreign policy may be different. The policies of various countries will ultimately depend on their fundamental interests, but the issue of war and peace can sometimes be decided face-to-face. Matsuoka also recounted that after the signing of the Tripartite Pact last September, he received a call from German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop inviting him to visit the Axis capitals. Eight years ago, he had a long talk with Mussolini and also met Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Shanghai, but he had no face-to-face meeting with the German leader. Matsuoka also said that Japan's foreign policy will revolve around the Tripartite Pact. As Foreign Minister, he helped to conclude the pact, so it is natural for him to visit the German leader. This trip may provide a new opportunity to observe the situation in Western Europe, especially the ongoing war. He did not specify a time limit for this trip, but he did not want to be away from Japan for more than six weeks. He was treated with great courtesy upon his arrival in Moscow. He wants to stop in Moscow on his return trip to meet with Soviet leaders. The scheduled program does not include巡　西歐情形. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)

Moscow – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka told reporters last night that after visiting Germany and Italy, he does not intend to go to London or Washington, but hopes to stay in Moscow for a few days on his return journey. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 24th)

Vichy – Diplomatic observers said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today is a formality. The two sides will only conduct lengthy talks when he returns to Moscow. The main goal of his trip is to visit Germany, and Soviet-Japanese issues will only be discussed on his way back. This issue is also very important to Japan, because Japan's ability to advance south depends on how this issue is resolved. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)

### China Pays Attention to Matsuoka's Activities

Chongqing – Chinese sources here continue to pay close attention to the activities of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in Moscow and Berlin, but there seems to be very little concrete news about Matsuoka's trip. Some believe that Matsuoka will complete preliminary negotiations with Moscow and Berlin first, and then make the trip, and that several concrete agreements will be signed as a result of this trip. Others believe that Matsuoka's trip to Moscow and Berlin does not bring any concrete solutions to the Far Eastern situation, but is actually seeking a solution. They all attach special importance to this, believing that Matsuoka will use his stay in Germany to determine what opportunities Germany's victory in Europe will create, so as to decide the path Japan should take in the future. It is generally believed that Matsuoka will discuss with Hitler the issue of the United States' possible active participation in the war and its impact on the position of Germany and Japan. It is generally believed that Matsuoka will persuade Hitler to pressure Chongqing to negotiate peace with Japan and request Hitler to order Moscow to stop Soviet aid to China. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)

Tokyo – According to Japanese official sources, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union was also among those present during Foreign Minister Matsuoka's official visit in Moscow. Matsuoka later visited the Ambassador of the Vichy French government to the Soviet Union. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)

Editorial

### Lamenting Shanghai

Please look at Shanghai today, what a world it has become! Has there ever been one as bad as today before? Is there any place outside Shanghai as bad as Shanghai? The worst of the worst, unprecedented in ancient and modern times, in China and abroad, what has caused it? We cherish Shanghai, and we are heartbroken to see this phenomenon, and we are worried and indignant about its future. We deeply lament Shanghai, and we cannot bear not to appeal to Shanghai.

Examining Shanghai: Shanghai's sins against human civilization and the Chinese nation can be said to be innumerable. However, this is only one side of Shanghai: cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries are carried out here, and Chinese and foreign goods are imported and exported here. Through this communication and throughput, it has directly and indirectly contributed to this century. Its achievements cannot be denied. If we are to make impassioned arguments, it is difficult to argue with one point. If it is said that after Shanghai became an isolated island, its manpower and material resources did not make a significant contribution to the great cause of resistance and construction, and central government orders were difficult to implement, and foreign exchange and other general consumption were undoubtedly a leakage of national power, then it is a superfluous tumor. This is one argument. If it is said that Shanghai relies on international forces, which hinders control in case of emergency, so that the achievements of the conquest cannot be carried out, then it is an obstacle. This is another argument. If it is said that Shanghai has eroded the basic principles and morality of human society in general, so that evils such as fraud, monopoly, opium, gambling, murder, etc., can all be indulged, then it is a den of demons. This is another argument. If it is said that traffic between Shanghai and the mainland is blocked, it has lost its geographical advantage, and is no longer a trade hub, with nothing to plan and no business to operate, then after a hundred years of opening up, the last days are approaching, then it is a ruin. This is another argument. Of all these arguments, the viewpoints are very different, and almost the same conclusion can be drawn: abandon it, destroy it, and there is nothing to be lamented. However, upon careful observation of the situation, not only do we cling to the old and adhere to the law, but those who truly cherish Shanghai as we do do not want to abandon Shanghai, destroy Shanghai, and cannot bear to see it being abandoned and destroyed; too much is as bad as too little, and we cherish it and love it so much, that we爭 it so much. Alas, who knows that爭 it is the reason for destroying it!

Two years ago in mid-March, Shanghai's concessions were in turmoil, and it seemed that they could not be protected for long. When this newspaper discussed it, it said, "Who wants to destroy Shanghai? I believe that no one wants to destroy it; who can destroy Shanghai? I believe that no one cannot destroy it. Only because no one wants to destroy it, even though it has gone through many tribulations, it has finally been preserved by the forbearance of all parties, as it is today. If there is no forbearance, it will disintegrate; the turmoil and unrest are almost signs of disintegration; however, is this the original wish of all parties? If you want to destroy Shanghai, it is very easy to destroy it; if the original wish is not like this, then it is hoped that all parties will be brave in reflecting and examining themselves." At that time, the factors of unrest were different from those of today; however, what was discussed at that time still holds true to this day, and will always hold true. Why is it that preservation is due to forbearance, and forbearance is due to the fact that each party has something to cherish. If there is nothing to cherish in Shanghai, then this small area can be razed to the ground as easily as turning one's hand, who can protect it? Please收斂 the posture of drawing swords and preparing bows, please think calmly, is this not the logic, is this not the situation and the勢!

Or we think that争 is to destroy. It is indeed because Shanghai is not to be爭. Shanghai is Shanghai because of its complexity; to爭 it is to消長, to transform complexity into purity, then although Shanghai is not leveled, it will变质 and变态 and no longer maintain its 非常可重, 非常可愛的 Shanghai. Not only is it not to be爭, it is also unnecessary to爭. Shanghai is Shanghai, with absolutely no independence, but only смотря at the great environment; if the environment is safe, then Shanghai is safe, if the environment is dangerous, then Shanghai is dangerous, if the environment is black, then it is black, if the environment is white, then it is white; today's Shanghai, the world as a whole is the environment from which it transforms. If Shanghai is not destroyed, then the world situation will dominate Shanghai's progress; it is also regardless of whether Shanghai is destroyed or not, it is absolutely not enough to determine the world situation, it is absolutely not enough to change the environment in which it is located. Therefore, it is said that Shanghai is unnecessary to爭. To爭 for Shanghai, then what is to be爭 should be outside Shanghai, above Shanghai. To爭 in Shanghai, then no matter what is to be爭 for control, what is to be爭 for honor and disgrace, what is to be爭 for anger and grudges, to爭 in Shanghai will destroy Shanghai!

We cherish Shanghai, lament Shanghai, and therefore appeal to Shanghai, may those who do not want to destroy Shanghai be blessed!

### Ministry of Education Schedules Regular Meetings to Review Academic Terminology; Seven Subjects Including Electrical Engineering

Chongqing: Because scholars translate various academic terms in China independently, discrepancies and inconsistencies often arise, which greatly inconveniences academic research. After the establishment of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, compiling and standardizing terminology became one of its major tasks. The compilation process involves first collecting English, German, French, and Japanese terms for each discipline, consulting existing translations, carefully selecting and rejecting terms, and translating them appropriately. The Ministry of Education then hires domestic experts to organize review committees to scrutinize the terms. It takes two or three years of careful study and discussion before each compilation is published. Since the establishment of the Bureau in 1932, it has published terms for fifteen subjects, including astronomy, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Thirty-two subjects, including philosophy, sociology, politics, and economics, have been compiled and sent to experts for review. Thirty-three subjects, including anthropology, physiology, pathology, and physical education, are currently being compiled. Currently, the terminology for seven subjects, including society, education, economics, statistics, electrical engineering (electricity), mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering, has been individually reviewed by experts in each field. The Ministry of Education has specifically scheduled review meetings to be held at the Central Library in Chongqing starting at 9:00 a.m. on the 26th of this month. Each subject has several thousand terms, with mechanical engineering having the most, with over 17,000 terms. It is reported that committee members from various regions have arrived in Chongqing one after another, prepared to attend the discussion. (Telegram dated the 24th)

People here are paying close attention to the planned railway between Kunming and Lashio and the supplementary highway currently under construction. However, it is generally believed that before the completion of the long, five- to six-hundred-mile railway between Kunming and Lashio, the most feasible way to increase the import volume via Burma is to increase the efficiency of the Burma Road. Recognizing this, the Chinese authorities are currently organizing a committee, which is reportedly to be named the "Yunnan-Burma Road Transportation Engineering Supervisory Committee." It is also reported that Yu Feipeng will be the chairman of the committee, with Mr. Baker as the chief inspector. It is also reported that the other members of this five-person committee will be Minister of Communications Zhang Jia'ao, a Burmese official, and another Chinese. The committee will begin work on May 1st. It is further reported that under the chief inspector, Mr. Baker, there will be one assistant chief inspector, in addition to five inspectors, in charge of transportation, engineering, repair, supply, and training personnel. The chief inspector's office will become an adjusting administrative body, handling all concrete problems in the transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road. The committee will be controlled by the Military Affairs Commission and directly subordinate to the Transportation Management Committee under the Military Affairs Commission, which manages all wartime transportation in the country. Mr. Baker will leave Chongqing on Wednesday for Kunming, where he will begin conducting inspections along the road. Mr. Baker will also meet with Burmese authorities in Lashio.

Washington: A spokesperson for the Chinese ambassador here declined to comment on the news of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, saying that any news to be released should come from the United States. Well-informed sources here are paying close attention to this news, saying that the United States must have encouraged the construction of this railway and indicated that it would cooperate by providing construction materials and vehicles, and may even have encouraged Chongqing to issue US$100 million in bonds to finance the construction of the road, but the United States may not directly sign or guarantee the issuance of these bonds. Officials here also believe that if this railway is completed quickly, it will be very useful, and also said that although Japan will bomb this road as it did with the Yunnan-Burma Road, the roadbed of this railway will be the same as the highway, making it extremely easy to repair, and fortunately, the railway can operate at night and repairs can be carried out during the day. These sources also pointed out that this railway will not only increase the volume of goods transported to the Chinese interior, but will also facilitate the export of Chinese goods. Now that the Japanese are still focused on Europe and the Soviet Union is still suspicious of Germany and Japan, China's construction of the railway is an excellent opportunity because there is no interference from any party at this time. Some experts estimate that the railway between Kunming and Lashio can be completed within one year. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)

Chongqing: It was learned today that regarding the issuance of US$100 million in public bonds in the United States to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway, although the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications have obtained the permission of the highest authorities and formulated a detailed plan, the legislative procedures have not yet been completed. Authoritative sources declared that this plan will be discussed at the weekly meeting of the Executive Yuan and then sent to the Supreme National Defense Council for final approval. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)

Washington: There was interest here yesterday in the news reported in the newspapers that China plans to build a railway from Kunming to Lashio. News from Chongqing said that the United States jointly decided on this railway and agreed to issue US$10 million in construction bonds in the United States as economic aid. It was also said that Dr. John R. Steelman, administrative assistant to President Roosevelt, had proposed this railway plan in his report. Officials have not yet confirmed this. Yesterday, news from Chongqing said that two railway engineers and a well-known Chinese businessman from San Francisco had recently left Chongqing for the United States to promote this plan. Well-informed sources said that Chongqing had been studying this plan for a long time, but the changes in the world situation recently prompted its active implementation. Finance Ministry officials said that the Ministry of Finance has not yet taken any special action on this matter. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)

### Tianjin French Concession Power Plant; Labor Strike Resolved

Tianjin: At 4:20 this afternoon, Chinese employees of the French Concession power plant went on strike, causing parts of the French Concession to be without light for several hours tonight. The strike was resolved at 10:00 p.m., and work was immediately resumed. The French Consul in Tianjin, Mr. Collin de Boisriou, went to the plant to assist in the negotiations and accepted the demands put forward by the strikers. The areas affected by the strike included the areas where the French consulate and the French military barracks were located. The strikers made nine demands, including two demands to increase wages and reduce working hours to eight hours per day, which were accepted by the plant after negotiations. The remaining seven demands, including workers' pensions, will be discussed tomorrow. According to Chinese sources, the strikers demanded an additional twenty yuan on top of the current monthly rice subsidy. (Reuters telegram dated the 24th)

### Affected by the Wars in Europe, Asia, and Africa; North and South America Intensify Cooperation; Refusing Intrusion of Non-American Powers; Signing Reciprocal Trade Agreements to Seek Economic Prosperity

Washington: The year 1940 has already come to an end. In this year, the material cooperation and friendly relations between the United States and other countries in the Americas have reached an unprecedented high point in the history of Pan-American relations. Because the economies of most countries in the entire Western Hemisphere were affected by the wars in Europe, Asia, and Africa, the governments of the countries in the New World took unanimous steps this year to prevent the wars from extending to the coasts of these countries, while also seeking ways to cultivate their economies. Among the various methods, financial assistance from the United States was the most important. A prominent example of Pan-Americanism this year was the meeting of foreign ministers held in Havana last July.

Signing Treaties to Strengthen Defense

At this meeting, many treaty agreements were signed, the main purpose of which was to organize and strengthen the defense of the American continent. The most important of the agreements was the unanimous expression by the American countries of opposition to the transfer of sovereignty over territories in the Western Hemisphere from non-American countries to other parties. This agreement was clearly intended to prevent the Axis powers from taking over the territories of France, the Netherlands, and even Britain, and establishing a foothold in the Americas. This agreement also stipulated a method whereby, if the territories of France, the Netherlands, and other countries in the Western Hemisphere were threatened, one or more countries in the Americas would rise up and occupy the threatened territories. This meeting was held in a very tense atmosphere, and the opinions of the various countries on all major issues quickly converged, which was commendable, and it was considered reasonable that this convergence of opinions should occur at a Pan-American meeting.

US Trades Warships for Bases

After this meeting, Britain and the United States traded warships for bases. The United States used fifty old destroyers to exchange for naval and air bases in Newfoundland, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, Trinidad, and British Guiana. The United States' acquisition of these bases is extremely important for the defense of the American continent, especially the defense of Panama. After this exchange was established, the US State Department immediately declared that other republics in the Americas could also use these bases. At the end of the year, negotiations between the United States and Latin American countries on the defense of the American continent still seemed to have latent difficulties, because the Uruguayan Senate had expressed opposition to this kind of negotiation, while the Uruguayan House of Representatives supported the government's policy, and President Alfredo Baldomir officially stated that his government had launched a defensive cooperation plan. By December, the important meeting between the foreign ministers of Uruguay and Argentina had laid the cornerstone of defensive cooperation, and special attention was paid to general cooperation between the two countries in the defense of the Western Hemisphere. The leaders of the governments of Ecuador, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic stated that they were doing their best to expand various important facilities for the United States to engage in continental defense, and it was generally expected that an agreement on defense cooperation between Mexico and the United States could also be established soon.

Countries Prevent Fifth Columns

Many Latin American governments have recognized the activities of fifth columns. A shocking Nazi conspiracy has been discovered in Uruguay, which has aroused the research of the legislative body, while the Argentine authorities are still closely investigating the activities of the Nazi Party in the Misiones Province from an administrative and judicial perspective. Mexico and Brazil have ordered the expulsion of dozens of Nazi consular officials and diplomats engaged in propaganda activities, and the Cuban Senate has also requested the government to implement an ordinance on the totalitarians engaging in propaganda. Colombia is also implementing various laws and regulations to resist the fifth columns of the Fascist Party and the Communist Party. After the German-operated SCADTA airline in Colombia was liberated, Ecuador signed a contract with Pan American-Grace Airways, and SCADTA's monopoly in the Ecuadorian airline industry was also deprived. Latin American countries have suffered almost entirely from the pain of war in commerce, industry, and finance.

US Provides Credit Loans to Various Countries

Last summer, the US Congress increased the capital of the Export-Import Bank of Washington by $500 million to assist Latin America. Last December, the United States announced that it would allocate $50 million from the US Treasury's stabilization fund and provide $60 million in credit from the Export-Import Bank to Argentina. These two loans were to alleviate Argentina's economic pressure, one effect of which was the partial lifting of US dollar exchange restrictions, allowing US goods to be imported into Argentina, because Argentina had reached a point where its trade deficit with the United States had caused US imports to almost come to a standstill. The Export-Import Bank also advanced US$20 million to Brazil to enable Brazil to start a steel industry. In addition, the United States also provided loans to other countries in Latin America for these countries to engage in the construction of public works, industries, railway equipment and materials, and stabilize exchange rates. Mostly due to US cooperation, the coffee-producing countries of the Americas have formed a coffee cartel. Each country is permitted by the United States to import an equal amount of coffee into the United States. This approach is sufficient to save these coffee growers, who are facing danger due to the loss of European markets. Officials in many Latin American countries have expressed their willingness to promote larger markets in the United States, rather than hoping to borrow funds. People in various countries are studying ways to expand their markets. Negotiations between the United States and Bolivia to purchase large quantities of Bolivian tin have begun. These Bolivian tin will be shipped to the United States for refining in the future. Also, in mid-December, negotiations on the United States purchasing large quantities of Chilean nitrates and copper produced by Chile and Peru were underway. South American countries, initiated by Brazil and Argentina, are working to sign a reciprocal trade agreement to reduce tariffs and other restrictions between each other and increase their commerce. Also, many countries are engaged in national defense preparations.

Military Personnel from Various Countries Come to the US for Observation

The Argentine Congress is considering a US$100 million rearmament plan. Uruguay is also preparing a military plan. Brazil has been engaged in large-scale peacetime maneuvers. Chile has increased its conscription quota, and representatives of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force have been sent to several important countries. At the end of last year, chiefs of staff and senior military officers from various Latin American countries inquired with the United States, becoming guests of the US Department of the Army and visiting various army outposts, airfields, military training camps, and arsenals.

### Labor Strike Occurs in US Steel Plant

Bethlehem: A strike occurred at the Bethlehem Steel Company's plant here today, and national defense orders worth US$150,000 are also in jeopardy. The Steel Workers Organizing Committee notified the company last night that if it did not cancel the election of officers of its independent employee association, 18,000 workers would strike today. At the same time, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee protested to the Production Management Bureau against the employee representation method of the Bethlehem Steel Company, which had been declared illegal by the National Labor Relations Board. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)

### US Aid to Britain and Other Bills Will Be Signed by the President; Documents Sent by Airplane to Roosevelt

Washington: Congress this week will be able to send President Roosevelt a rearmament and aid-to-Britain appropriation bill worth nearly $15,000,000,000. The main body of this huge sum is actually a combination of three bills, the largest of which is the $700 billion aid-to-Britain bill, which should be passed within the next day or two. Other steps include the $3,415,000,000 naval appropriation bill, which was passed by the Senate on Thursday, and the $4,073,000,000 national defense supplementary bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives on Friday. The government today attempted to have the Argentine corned beef order re-voted because Vice President Wallace's absence from the vote caused the bill to be rejected in the Senate by a vote of 32 to 32. This action will delay the consideration of the $700 billion US aid bill today by an hour or two. Majority party leader Senator Barkley said that Democratic Senator Russell of Georgia had voted in favor of amending the corned beef order, but it was not recorded, so the actual vote on the amendment should have been 33 to 32. The authorities will immediately clarify this point. The rejection of the amendment to the corned beef order was actually the government's biggest defeat since the Lend-Lease Act. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)

Washington: President Roosevelt today commissioned Chester Bowles as chairman of the newly established Supreme Mediation Board, and also appointed ten other members to the board. Thereafter, the board has full authority to mediate labor disputes in national defense production. The commission was issued yesterday along with other documents to the naval patrol bomber carrying them to the President's yacht, the Potomac. Working in the tropical sun, the President signed several bills, including a bill appropriating US$100 million to build public works for the US Navy. The President and his party are now planning to continue fishing on a cruise to the Caribbean Sea in the next few days. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)

Washington: Government leaders predicted yesterday that the $700 million appropriation bill to implement the Lend-Lease program would be given final passage by Congress today and sent to President Roosevelt by naval fast plane, as the President is currently on a sea cruise in Florida. (International News Agency telegram dated the 24th)

Arthurs Bay: President Roosevelt, wearing an old yellow silk sweater, fished on his speedboat for a long time on Saturday, with a destroyer protecting him next to the boat. The President will take a ten-day break here with several of his Washington officials and his personal physician to relieve the fatigue he has recently felt from Washington's political affairs. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)

### US Steel Production is Enormous; All for Use by Britain and Canada

New York: The New York Herald Tribune reported that the chairman of the board of the United States Steel Corporation, Mr. Olds, said that the quantity of steel currently being produced by the company for the manufacture of military weapons is far greater than during the First World War, and the number of workers employed is also unprecedented. A large quantity of this steel is now being shipped to Britain and Canada. (Reuters telegram dated the 24th)

### The United States Will Join the European War No Later Than June

Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun today predicted that the United States will join the European war no later than June and as early as April. The trigger will be the sinking of American grain-carrying convoy ships by Germany. It is said that the domestic grain production in the United Kingdom is only enough to meet 40% of its needs, and the reserves can only last until August this year. Therefore, the US transport of grain is absolutely essential. If the United States cannot escort food to the UK with transport ships, its Lend-Lease Act cannot take effect.

### British Officials Criticize the US for Transporting Food to France; This Move Must Guard Against Supplying the Enemy; Pétain Secretly Banquets the US Ambassador

London - Authoritative sources this morning said that the US's hasty decision to transport food to unoccupied areas of France would undermine the effect of the British blockade, or could lead to "increasing conflicts." Semi-official sources said that the British are currently trying to satisfy Americans who express sympathy for the Free Zone of France. However, if the Americans transporting food do not "cooperate closely" with the blockade authorities, a serious situation may arise. The United States announced that two more ships will transport food to France. British officials were very surprised to hear this. It is said that British officials knew early on that the second batch of food could only be shipped after the first batch of grain had been distributed and it had been verified that it had not fallen into the hands of the Germans. The United Kingdom certainly does not want to argue with the United States about this matter. However, although this matter is said to be motivated by humanitarianism, it will lighten Germany's food burden on France and may make the blockade policy not worth the loss. (International News Agency dispatch on the 14th)

London - Yesterday, it was said here that according to news from Washington, the United States' intention to ship two ships of flour to unoccupied France does not mean that the UK will open its blockade line, and it is believed that shipping issues are still under discussion. Undersecretary of State Welles declared in Washington on Saturday that the US State Department has completed the loading of two ships of flour for shipment to France. This flour will be distributed by the American Red Cross. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

Vichy - Marshal Pétain, the head of France, gave a "secret" banquet for US Ambassador Leahy on Saturday night. Guests included Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Navy Darlan, and the envoy and leader of the diplomatic corps Valery, a total of twenty people. Officials strictly kept the banquet a secret, and reporters were not allowed to send telegrams before midnight. The reason was not explained, but the US Embassy had previously announced that there would be a banquet. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

Washington - Regarding the matter of two French cargo ships about to load a large amount of food and sail to the Free Zone of France, although opinions vary among the newspapers here, they all praised the French Ambassador to the United States, Henry-Haye. For example, the "Washington Times" stated, "French Ambassador to the United States, Henry-Haye, has been working hard in the past two months to enable the United States to transport food to France, and has now achieved success, which is a great success in Ambassador Henry-Haye's diplomatic activities." (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

### The United States Transports Food Supplies to the United Kingdom

Washington - Yesterday, reliable sources here revealed that the government is currently loading a large amount of food for transport to the UK, and has established a special department of the Agricultural Committee to assist the British government. The committee intends to carry out its affairs with 500 million yuan. At the same time, President Roosevelt is also planning to establish a federal food execution agency. The first batch of goods to be shipped to the UK includes 12 million pounds of lard, because the United States' lard reserves have increased greatly, with 31.75 million pounds, an increase of 6.1 million pounds compared to last year, and exceeding the average by 16.15 million pounds. At the same time, there is also an increase in surplus vegetable oil. It is said that the government does not fully know all the food items needed by the UK, but only knows that powdered milk, cheese, white pagoda eggs, pork, dried fruits, and animal fats are needed by the UK, and it is rumored that the British have sent a special commissioner to come to the United States soon. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

### The UK Holds a National Prayer

London - Yesterday was the National Day of Prayer. The King and Queen, and the Princesses, also mingled with the public, attending services in churches to pray.

Bomb and gun sounds were often heard during the prayer, but no one was frightened away. The Archbishop of Canterbury broadcasted last night, briefly saying that we should think of the hundreds of millions of people in many countries who are now enslaved by the enemy, who are yearning for our victory to save them. Consider the desire for the entire Empire to be united and the victories that the British army has already achieved. We do not sincerely have reason to be proud that we bear the noblest mission. The Catholic Cardinal and Slade also broadcast, encouraging the people to fight against the dark forces that resist God to maintain justice and righteousness. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

He also said that faster and stronger bombers and fighters are now ready to be dispatched for combat. (International News Agency dispatch on the 24th)

London - Last night, British planes attacked Berlin again. This was the thirtieth time since the start of the war. According to the official announcement here, the bombing was very successful, but not very intense. British air units also carried out short-term bombings of enemy invasion bases last night. Targets in the Calais area were also among them. Major explosions could be heard on the southeastern coast of the UK. Although the French coast was shrouded in thick fog at the time, flashes could still be seen across the sea. A reporter for the Berlin non-commercial radio station has admitted to the air raid there, saying that several British bombers participated in the bombing, but only a few were able to reach the city center. High-explosive bombs were dropped from high altitude. Only residential areas in Berlin and its suburbs were bombed, and the damage was minimal. Several fires were extinguished immediately, but several soldiers and civilians were killed or injured. The reporter also said that British aircraft also invaded northern Germany, but the German side broadcasting to the United States said that British bombers only reached the suburbs of Berlin. The reporter also made contradictory remarks, saying that several incendiary bombs fell in the embassy area of Berlin. The embassy area is located in the center of Berlin, very close to Wilhelm Street, where most German government agencies are located. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

London - Yesterday, people in a southern English town had just left the church when they witnessed a British fighter plane engaged in combat with and shooting down a German bomber. Yesterday, British airspace saw only slight enemy aircraft activity, and a total of two German bombers were shot down. This was one of them. The tail of the second German plane, in northern Scotland, was hit by anti-aircraft fire while attempting to bomb ships in a mooring port. It caught fire and crashed. Yesterday morning, several German planes sneaked close to southwestern England and were repelled by intense anti-aircraft fire. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that yesterday, enemy aircraft separately sneaked to the coast near the English Channel and an area in northern Scotland to drop bombs, causing slight damage and few casualties. Plymouth has begun clearing after two days of heavy bombing. Rescue teams are constantly rescuing injured and killed people from under the rubble. Soldiers of the army and navy have been clearing dangerous broken walls for more than forty-eight hours. It has now been revealed that several children under the age of ten have died in the bombing. Two hospitals have been evacuated, and another small hospital has been completely destroyed. The King and Queen toured Plymouth the day before it was bombed. The Lady Astor, wife of the Mayor of Plymouth, said, "No matter what suffering the people of Plymouth endure, I know their spirit will be able to cope with it." (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### New Zealand Rushes to Build Naval and Land War Equipment; Canada Approves War Expenses

Wellington - New Zealand's war effort is showing greater development every week. Several machine factories are now manufacturing various war equipment. Government factories are also busy manufacturing machine gun mounts and three-inch mortars. The manufacture of small arms will soon double to meet the needs of the New Zealand army. The manufacture of naval war equipment has also made progress. Auckland is currently building minesweepers to meet the urgent needs of the navy. After a New Zealand delegation went to New Delhi to participate in the conference of British territories east of the Suez Canal, it has conveyed the need for British technicians to study New Zealand's industrial possibilities, aimed at assisting the British Empire's overseas war effort and defending the dominion. These British technicians are now reporting their research results to the British government, and it is expected that the British government will formulate a manufacturing process suitable for New Zealand to implement within a considerable period of time.

### The UK Plans to Adjust Post-War Industry

London - British industry is now focused on the war effort, causing many non-essential industries to be shut down. This matter is now of great concern. It is expected that the Minister of Commerce Lyttelton will announce more specific measures in Parliament to adjust the status of these industries after the war. A parliamentary reporter for the Observer said that the House of Commons will definitely be dissatisfied if there is not enough opportunity to discuss the entire major issue of post-war industrial construction. It is heard that the government now has a plan in mind, and has scheduled several plans for the transition period. It is expected that after the end of the war, there will be a period of industrial organization disorder. At that time, there may be a need to establish businesses to barter. Since the United States is now able to supply democratic countries during wartime, it will also be able to undertake the work of supplying the world during peacetime in the future. Therefore, the House of Commons will ask the government whether it has sought or is preparing to seek to conduct research on economic recovery with the US authorities in advance. The general impression is that within a few months after the armistice, there will inevitably be extreme difficulties such as those that occurred after the last war. First, there will be a global need for the supply of goods, and then there will be the danger of a major business collapse and a sharp drop in prices. These economic anomalies should be prevented as far as possible with far-sighted plans and appropriate deployments. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### The Spanish Government Clarifies Its Diplomatic Attitude

Madrid - Since the United States passed the Lend-Lease Act, Spanish officials have recently stated their diplomatic policy for the first time, especially emphasizing that Spain can maintain a neutral position in the current war. According to Duval Pon, the head of the Spanish Information and Propaganda Department who recently accompanied Spanish Foreign Minister Sunner to Germany and Italy, "Our most serious danger is the geographical location of Spain. If we do not have military equipment or are careless, we cannot survive. Spain has been unknown for hundreds of years, and now wants to stand out. Hitler's current actions remind people of what Napoleon did in the past, but Napoleon added misfortune to Spain, while Hitler strictly punishes France and Britain, which made Spain a third-rate country."

### British Military Communiqué Announces the Capture of an Important Town in Abyssinia; Will Take the Abyssinian Capital Directly from Neghelli; Fighting Continues in the Keren Area

Cairo - After the British army occupied Neghelli, an important town in southern Abyssinia, it tightened the British encirclement around Addis Ababa. Neghelli controls the intersection of avenues leading to the north, east, and west, and is strategically important. The British Imperial Army can now directly take the Abyssinian capital, which is 275 miles away to the north. According to military experts, the countryside there is low-lying, and the British army can advance along the roads that run through the river basin without much hindrance. The fall of Neghelli is undoubtedly a major blow to Italian General Graziani. When Italy invaded Abyssinia, Graziani led his troops to advance rapidly and was awarded the title of Baron of Neghelli. The British military communiqué announced the capture of Neghelli and stated that the fighting in other areas of Abyssinia continued to develop in favor of the British army. The fighting in the Keren area continued. On Saturday, the British army won several local victories and surrounded Keren remotely. Patrols were active. When a patrol encountered enemy troops near a battery, it notified the artillery unit for assistance. The British artillery immediately opened fire, and the British patrol used artillery fire to assist in destroying enemy troops and capturing 130 enemy soldiers. The British army suffered no losses. The communiqué ended by saying that there was nothing to report in Libya. Also, the British Air Force communiqué stated that the British Air Force engaged in extensive activities in Italian East Africa to assist the British army on land. Fighter planes repeatedly attacked enemy positions in the Keren area. The Asmara railway station was heavily bombed on Saturday. British fighter planes that launched the attack clashed with several Italian Fiat fighter planes. Two enemy planes were hit and caught fire and crashed. Enemy barracks and warehouses in the Gondar area were bombed and set on fire. South African British troops attacked a train on the Djibouti to Addis Ababa railway, and at least one train was hit and burned. British bombers also strafed trains in Afdan and Gora, and bombed motor transport convoys and enemy positions on the highway. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### Italy Exhausted and Anxious, Attempting to Reorganize the Defeated Troops in Abyssinia

London - Athens Radio broadcast the words of an Italian prisoner.

The Italian army on the Tepelene front was severely attacked by the Greek army and fled back in disarray. It is now hastily deploying defenses along the front. There are now only small-scale tree battles, but both sides' artillery units are active. Also, the British Air Force communiqué stated that on Saturday, enemy fighter planes continuously attacked a British Air Force base in western Greece. The material damage was minor, and there were no casualties. One enemy plane was shot down, and several were heavily damaged. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

"Greek artillery fire severely damaged the Italian troops reinforcing the front line." Italian outposts were captured after entering the Greek front line. Reports said that during the artillery battle, the Italian artillery unit consumed countless shells, but the Greek position remained unmoved. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

### French Commercial Attaché Beaten in Japan; US Ambassador, Representing the Diplomatic Corps, Protests to Matsuoka

This matter occurred nearly three weeks ago, and Japanese newspapers have not published a single word about it. It is heard that the US Ambassador's letter was in the name of the diplomatic corps, as he is the leader of the corps. The content of the letter protested the fact that the French Commercial Attaché was beaten by a group of rickshaw pullers at the Kobe pier for no reason, and other incidents of insults against foreigners in Japan. The US Ambassador's letter caused Foreign Minister Matsuoka to issue a statement to the Japanese people on the train to Osaka, expressing his dissatisfaction with this action, which violated Japan's tradition of hospitality and national honor.

### International Anecdotes (10) (2) Four Giants of US War Preparation

The United States' unprecedented expansion of armaments plan is directed by a large-scale manufacturer, a labor leader, a newspaper publisher, and a lawyer and politician. Among these four giants, one is Knudsen, the former general manager of General Motors, now chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission and director of the Armaments Manufacturing Department, one is Hillman, chairman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, now vice chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission and director of the Labor Department, one is Colonel Knox, publisher of the Chicago Daily News, now Secretary of the Navy, and the other is Colonel Stimson, formerly a lawyer in New York and then Secretary of State, now Secretary of War. They must all assist President Roosevelt in sharing the powers granted by the Constitution and Congress.

These four figures come from different backgrounds, but none of them are Democrats. Knox and Stimson belong to the Republican Party. Hillman and Knudsen are not affiliated with any party, and neither of them are Americans. Knudsen was originally from Denmark, and Hillman was originally from Lithuania. Both immigrated to the United States at the age of twenty.

In the minds of the general public, Knudsen is an outstanding mass manufacturer who resigned from his position as general manager of General Motors with an annual salary of $300,400 (one of the ten highest-paid positions in the United States, with an average daily salary of $830) to work as a defense commissioner without taking a penny. He is not someone ordinary. He is now fifty-eight years old. When he first came to the United States, he worked at the Ford Motor Company and soon became the only favorite of "Automobile King" Ford. In 1922, he changed his job to become the deputy manager of Chevrolet Motor Company. In 1937, he became the general manager of General Motors until he was selected by President Roosevelt. This person is six feet tall, with silver hair and a pair of pince-nez glasses with black ribbons. He usually walks quickly and does not like to talk at length.

Hillman is a burly man with glasses and black hair. He is now fifty-three years old and is a Jew born in Lithuania. Since 1915, he has been elected as the chairman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and is known for his ability to handle labor issues in the industry. He also served as the vice chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization when it was first established until last November, when he disagreed with Lewis, the chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, on the issue of Roosevelt's third term as president. When Lewis announced his support for Republican presidential candidate Willkie's election, he stopped working with him.

Colonel Knox, now sixty-six years old, was born in Boston and was originally the publisher of the Chicago Daily News. He was only a private in the Spanish-American War, then worked as a journalist, and later became the general manager of the Hearst newspapers. He served as the Republican vice-presidential candidate in 1936 and wrote a book in 1938 criticizing President Roosevelt's "New Deal," but when the situation in the European war worsened, he tried his best to advocate aid to Britain. He has maintained the title of reserve colonel since the last European war. He is of medium height, with sandy hair, hates official malpractices, and is decisive in his work.

Colonel Stimson, tall and taciturn, is now seventy-three years old and was originally a famous lawyer in New York. He served as Secretary of War during the Taft administration, Governor-General of the Philippines during the Coolidge administration, and Secretary of State during the Hoover administration. His political views are characterized by his firm opposition to Japan's expansion of power. His book "The Far Eastern Crisis" has the unique insight of a great politician.

### The Central Bank's Two Offices Were Tragically Bombed Yesterday; Both Bombs Were Delivered in Wooden Boxes; The Explosive Force Was Tremendous, Resulting in Eight Deaths and Over Thirty Injuries

Fortunately, a Bomb at the China Agricultural Bank Did Not Detonate

Yesterday, from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, shocking news of the bombing of financial institutions spread within an hour. The targets were the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank at 439 Avenue Albert (now Avenue Ruijin Er), where seven people died and one was injured, and the Central Bank's office at 702 Jing'an Temple Road (now West Nanjing Road) in the International Settlement, where one person died and thirty-five were injured. Simultaneously, a bomb was discovered at the China Farmers Bank on Avenue Haig (now Huashan Road), but fortunately, it did not explode. This unprecedented bombing case is truly horrifying. Details have been investigated and are as follows:

Avenue Albert

The Tragic Bombing

Yesterday, at 3:50 PM, a timed bomb concealed in a wooden box was delivered to the reception area of the Central Bank's office on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. It detonated almost immediately with a deafening explosion that resonated far and wide. The bomb's destructive power was so great that it collapsed the staircase and part of the second floor. Upon receiving the news, the police swiftly dispatched a large number of detectives and police cars to the scene, temporarily closing off the surrounding traffic. They also urgently summoned the full complement of fire engines and ambulances from the Songshan Road Central Fire Brigade. Subsequent investigations revealed that eight people had been injured by the bomb blast and crushed under the collapsed building, with six dying instantly. One person died from severe injuries, and one sustained minor injuries and is currently receiving medical treatment at the Catholic Hospital. Among the dead was Chen Zongguang, the administrative director from Hangzhou, who had entered the building just minutes before the explosion and tragically perished. Another female victim was a family member of a driver on the second floor. Several of the dead were coolies who were in the process of moving the bank's belongings in preparation for its relocation. The perpetrators who planted the bomb had vanished without a trace beforehand.

Seven Deaths, One Injury

According to post-incident investigations, four messengers, Hua Baolin (from Shaoxing), Ji Asan (from Nantong), Zheng Guangcai (from Jiangbei), and Zhang Shiku (from Haimen), along with an electrician and Chen Zongguang (38 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 5 Hongren Lane, 398 Lafayette Road), the deputy director of the bank's administrative department, were standing outside the elevator door, intending to take the elevator upstairs. Unfortunately, they were all struck by shrapnel and fatally wounded. Qiu, the wife of Shan Alai, an electrician from Ningbo, and her younger sibling (20 years old), who resided in a small room on the second floor, were also victims when the floor collapsed. The younger sibling died on the spot, while Qiu suffered severe head injuries and died after being taken to Guangci Hospital. Another injured person, Xi Shuquanfu from Suzhou, suffered a leg injury that was not life-threatening and is currently being treated at Guangci Hospital. The police transported the seven bodies to the Taelstrasse morgue for examination today.

Further reports indicate that after the bomb explosion at the Central Bank on Avenue Albert, two senior military officers from a certain country drove to the scene around 5:00 PM to inspect the damage for about an hour before leaving in their original vehicle.

Jing'an Temple Road

A Wooden Box Delivered

The Central Bank had recently leased the second floor of the American-owned China Motors Company at 702 Jing'an Temple Road a month ago to serve as its Shanghai branch office. The entrance was through the back door of the China Motors Company, next to the back door of the Great China Theater on Biker Road (now Fengxian Road). Yesterday, at 3:52 PM, a man disguised as a mail carrier arrived at the bank carrying a wooden box resembling a soap crate, placed it at the entrance, and then left. The bank's clerks carried the box to the second floor and opened it, discovering a clock-like device with a pointer, its purpose unknown.

Sudden Explosion

They immediately telegraphed the police to report the situation. Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched two constables to investigate. Shortly after, a foreign officer arrived and identified the object as a timed bomb. As they attempted to move it, it exploded with a deafening blast, sending shrapnel flying in all directions, injuring thirty to forty people. The main door and glass display windows of the China Motors Company were completely shattered. It was reported that the cars on display were also damaged. At the bank's entrance on Biker Road, the main door and the interior of the second floor were severely damaged, with only the reinforced concrete pillars remaining standing. Fragments of glass, lead, wood, and plaster were scattered as far as the Southern Middle School and the sidewalks on the nearby roads. The glass on the side of the second floor overlooking the American Naval Club was completely destroyed, leaving only the steel frames. After the incident, the police dispatched a large number of officers to the scene to maintain order and close off traffic. The US Marines also arrived to assist with security. Red emergency vehicles were parked at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Biker Road, diagonally opposite the Fourth Joint Savings Society Bank. The injured were transported to the Baolong Hospital for treatment. Those with minor injuries were bandaged and discharged.

Hospitalized Individuals

He Jishi (50 years old, from Zhuji), Shen Kuilong (46 years old, from Huzhou), Zhang Zhaoxiong (30 years old, from Shanghai), Hu Dequan (41 years old, from Zhejiang), Wang Changhai (33 years old, from Changzhou), Zhao Songtao (50 years old, from Hebei), Lu Dexing (34 years old, from Ningbo), Zhang Rensheng (30 years old, local), Wang Bingjun (62 years old, from Jingjiang), Zhu Shouren (26 years old, from Xuzhou), Pan [blank]sheng (46 years old, from Shaoxing), Zhou Xingchu (47 years old, local), Xu Shaolin (46 years old, from Jiangsu), Hu Jifang (36 years old, from Shaoxing), Wang Zhenyang (56 years old, from Ningbo), Yan Jiahua (36 years old, from Jiangsu), Jiang Kechang (31 years old, from Tongzhou), Lu Shaogen (32 years old, from Pudong), Yang Yiming (22 years old, from Anhui), Lu Quanwu (50 years old, from Ningbo), Wang Zhongliang (29 years old, local), Xu Yinlin (44 years old, from Suzhou), Liu Peiquan (34 years old, from Changzhou), Zhang Ajin (36 years old, from Tongzhou), Wang Changfa (23 years old, from Nanjing), Li Xinglong (49 years old, from Hangzhou), Zhu Wenxiang (53 years old, from Ningbo), Li Changqi (37 years old, from Guangdong), Wang Lin (46 years old, from Hangzhou), Xu Shaobin (43 years old, from Hunan), Wang Fengguang (35 years old, from Guangdong), Gu Yueying (29 years old, from Guangdong). Additionally, Police Officer Wang Wenfu (53 years old, from Tianjin), badge number 375, was injured. Chinese Constables No. 2778 (seriously injured) and No. 2802 (minor injury) were stationed inside the bank by the police department. Furthermore, Wang Yunquan (46 years old, from Anhui), who worked in the document department, sustained fatal injuries and died at the hospital at 7:20 PM.

China Agricultural Bank

A Bomb Did Not Detonate

Yesterday, at around 3:30 PM, a person resembling a mail carrier carrying a heavy object weighing approximately 40 pounds delivered it to the China Farmers Bank near Avenue Haig and MacTaggart Road. The police, assuming it was an ordinary delivery, did not pay much attention. The person resembling a mail carrier entered the bank and placed the heavy object down before leaving. Bank employees, realizing something was amiss, immediately called the police, who dispatched officers to the bank to inspect the object. They discovered it was a heavy timed bomb. They immediately removed the clock's hands, preventing the bomb from detonating. The police then quickly and discreetly removed it.

### Japanese Blocked a Section of the Huangpu River to Secretly Load Wounded Soldiers for Repatriation; Two Passenger Ships Also Left Shanghai Last Week, Carrying Approximately Three Thousand Wounded Soldiers

The American United Press reported that the Japanese naval authorities blocked the Huangpu River between the Riverside Power Plant and Wusong yesterday (March 23rd), prohibiting ships from passing through, to facilitate the deployment of five Japanese troop transport ships. This operation was completed by this morning (March 24th), after which the section of the Huangpu River was reopened. The details of the Japanese ships' loading operations remain a secret, but it is generally believed that the loading took place late last night or early this morning, and the ships set sail for Japan, carrying an unknown number of Japanese soldiers, as the size of the transport ships is unclear. It was also reported that two 8,000-ton Japanese passenger ships left Shanghai last Saturday, carrying wounded soldiers. It is estimated that approximately three thousand Japanese soldiers, likely wounded in the fighting upstream of the Yangtze River, boarded the two passenger ships at the Jardine Matheson & Co. wharf in Yangshupu.

Another Account: Troops Being Transported Elsewhere

The Continental Daily News reported that the Japanese naval authorities temporarily blocked a section of the Huangpu River yesterday (March 23rd), during which five transport ships arrived in port, apparently to load troops for transfer to other parts of the Far East. According to local yachtsmen and boatmen, the section of the Huangpu River from the Shanghai Power Company's Yangshupu Power Plant to Wusong was completely blocked yesterday afternoon. Pleasure boats and other small vessels were prohibited from passing the power plant.

### The Shanghai General Labor Union Offers a Loyal Admonition to the Communists; Unified Military Command is an Iron Rule for Warfare; Strive to Complete the Great Task of Resistance and Reconstruction as Soon as Possible

The Shanghai General Labor Union, due to the New Fourth Army's unlawful disobedience, which led to its disbandment by official order, and the Central Government's seven councilors' disregard for right and wrong and failure to attend the Second Session of the People's Political Council, along with their unreasonable demands to expand the dispute, sends a loyal admonition to Mao Zedong and the other seven councilors in Yan'an. The full text is recorded as follows: To Councilor Mao Zedong in Yan'an, and to Qin Bangxian, Lin Zuhan, Chen Shaoyu, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, and Deng Yingchao: The New Fourth Army's unlawful and disorderly actions in Jiangsu and Anhui are known and witnessed by the people of the north and south of the Yangtze River. The government's strict enforcement of military discipline and its disbandment of the army by official order are supported by the entire nation. However, you, gentlemen, are turning a blind eye to right and wrong, showing bias and partiality, using this as an excuse to refuse to attend the Second Session of the People's Political Council, and making various unreasonable demands in order to betray the promise made by your party in September 1937, causing pain to those close to you and joy to your enemies. We believe that a unified military command is an iron rule for warfare. What is the date today? How can we allow internal strife to reignite? You, gentlemen, are the outstanding talents of our time, and the people of the entire country look up to you. We hope that you will keep your promises and, under one government and one military command, strive for victory and complete the great task of resistance and reconstruction as soon as possible. With utmost sincerity, we humbly hope that you will take note of this. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Labor Union.

### Election of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council Postponed by One Week; Extensive Discussions are Underway; Hoping for Unified Cooperation Among Residents of all Nationalities; Making Shanghai an Oasis in a World at War

According to a press release issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office yesterday, the election dates for the Municipal Council directors and the Land Commission, originally scheduled for April 2nd and 3rd, have now been changed to April 9th and 10th. This has been officially announced by the Consular Body leader, Mr. Hill. It is understood that the Municipal Council is currently exchanging views on the election issue with the British, American, and Japanese sides, a process that cannot be resolved within a few days. Furthermore, the deadline for submitting the list of candidates to the Municipal Council was previously noon on the 25th, and the annual election scheduled for April 2nd and 3rd was also fast approaching. Therefore, the Municipal Council suggested to the Consular Body that the election be postponed by one week to be held on the 9th and 10th. The Consular Body approved this suggestion yesterday morning.

The British and Americans Have Not Shown Signs of Concession

According to foreign sources, since the announcement of the Shanghai Municipal Council's decision to postpone the election date by a week, this period has become the most decisive time in the city's election history. During these seven days, the Japanese residents may be able to achieve their repeatedly failed goal of increasing the number of Japanese directors without voting through meetings and negotiations. This is because the British and American groups may concede one or two seats to the Japanese side, and residents of other nationalities may also seize the opportunity to gain a seat on the Municipal Council Board. However, prominent British and American businessmen told the Datong News Agency that they have not made any concessions in order to resolutely safeguard the rights and interests of their respective countries, so the aforementioned compromise cannot be confirmed.

The Scope of Negotiations Is Quite Broad

According to reliable sources, the scope of the negotiations currently underway is larger than generally expected. To avoid the tension among residents of various nationalities caused by the upcoming Municipal Council election, and to prevent the recurrence of the shooting and riot incidents that occurred at the Special General Meeting of Taxpayers in February, the consulates of various countries in the city are carefully considering the current distribution of directors in the hope of finding a solution that is acceptable to both sides. All of the aforementioned solutions must be negotiated and resolved before April 1st. Candidate names from various national resident groups must be submitted to the Municipal Council before noon on that day.

Hoping for Shanghai to Become a Paradise

According to [blank], the purpose of this move by the relevant authorities is to make Shanghai a paradise in a world at war. The British, American, Japanese, and Axis powers all do not want to see more troubles here. To avoid disputes, the British and Americans, who have a dominant position in the Municipal Council, are prepared to make some "fair" concessions to Japan. However, they cannot compromise beyond this limit. The crux of the matter is that the two sides have not yet reached a consensus on "what is fair" and "what is unreasonable." It is said that the Japanese have long had the idea of circumventing this problem because they are bound to fail in the election. If the two sides can compromise, the Japanese will be able to gain more seats on the Municipal Council.

Joint Cooperation Among Residents of All Nationalities

The scope of the current negotiations is not limited to the issue of Japanese directors. According to reliable sources, if the negotiations are successful, the large German community may gain a director's seat or a seat on the board. It is said that the relevant authorities have previously drafted a fair plan for the distribution of directors. When Mr. Nash, the Deputy General Manager of the Municipal Council, left Shanghai, he also published an article stating that if the Japanese can provide certain guarantees and make certain reforms in their area, the power of the Japanese in the Municipal Council should be expanded. To what extent the scope of the current negotiations is wide is currently unknown. However, one official said that the scope of the negotiations is "quite large." Whether the two plans mentioned above were discussed during the negotiations will be revealed soon. It was also said that Shanghai is an international city, and for the benefit of the entire city, municipal issues should be resolved in meetings.

### Rotary Club Weekly Meeting

The Shanghai Rotary Club's weekly meeting is scheduled for noon on Thursday, March 27th. Senor Eduardo Esqinosa, the Acting Chargé d'Affaires of the Mexican Embassy, will give a lecture on "The Situation in Mexico." Members from Shanghai and other cities are welcome to attend.

### The French Power Company's Labor Strike Returns to a Stalemate; Work Resumption Failed Yesterday Morning; The Major Reason is Conflicting Views Between Labor and Management; Arrested Workers May Be Sent to Court

The French Power Company's strike has now lasted for a week. Although the Political Department of the French Police Department has made every effort to mediate, the two sides have been unable to coordinate due to their conflicting views, resulting in the failure of several opportunities to resume work, declaring an end to illusions. Currently, the labor side wants to implement its demands, while the management side insists on its prejudices and refuses to give in. The future of the strike is increasingly deadlocked. The residents of the French Concession, who are suffering greatly from the prolonged delay, are all demanding that both sides change their attitudes and not disregard the welfare of society because of a dispute of emotions. The details of yesterday are recorded as follows:

Original Plan to Resume Work

After the labor side's failure to resume work on the 21st, the Political Department of the French Police Department temporarily suspended mediation. However, since it is a matter of great importance to the security of the French Concession, it was deemed inappropriate to abandon it. Therefore, although the 23rd was a Sunday, it still operated as usual, and at 4:00 PM that afternoon, it convened a meeting with labor representatives to frankly explore ways to resolve the strike and listen to more advice. After the labor side expressed its sincerity in resuming work, the Political Department guaranteed to the labor side that the minimum subsidy would increase from 18 yuan to 25 yuan, the allowance would increase by 10 yuan, wages would be paid as usual during the strike period, and the arrested workers would be released. The labor side immediately expressed its obedience, reached a compromise with the department, and agreed to start work again the next day (yesterday). The negotiations ended at 8:00 PM.

Failure

That night, the labor side sent personnel to notify the workers, instructing them to resume work on the 24th. At 7:30 AM yesterday morning, all the workers set off from Nanshi to the Luban Road factory site. At this time, the management had removed the iron fence and opened the gate. Two thousand workers entered the factory one after another, and the power generator was also turned on. However, since the management had not released the arrested coppersmith Ni Amao, the vehicles could not leave the factory to resume work. The labor side believed that this was in conflict with the compromise reached the day before and refused to resume work. The management also insisted on its opinion, resulting in the workers turning off the generator and dispersing. The scene of resuming work ended in illusion again.

Both Sides Insist. A reporter interviewed the Political Department of the French Police Department yesterday, which stated that the efforts had failed due to the insistence of both sides, which was a pity. It is now said that the department has suspended mediation. The reporter then visited the French Power Company, and the authorities were unwilling to express their views on the resumption of work, implying that they were not eager to resume work due to the current fuel shortage. They also stated that yesterday was the date for the workers to respond to their demands, but the labor representatives did not come, further complicating the strike.

Workers' Meeting. Yesterday, the French Police Department admitted to arresting a French Power Company worker, who will be brought to the French Concession court within days on charges of inciting the strike. All the workers are quite dissatisfied with this matter and insist that they will not resume work until the arrested workers are released. They have also scheduled an emergency meeting at the Dagil Road public sports field in Nanshi this afternoon to discuss countermeasures. According to general observations, the strike is unlikely to be resolved in the short term. The iron gate at Xieqiao, which was originally three doors opening together, had two of them locked yesterday afternoon, leaving only one door for entry and exit. Pedestrians and vehicles from Nanshi to the French Concession must undergo strict searches before they are allowed to pass through.

### Belgian Ambassador Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday

The Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. Guillaume, left Shanghai in mid-December of last year to go to Ping. After several months, he urgently wanted to go to Chongqing for official and private visits. He went to Shanghai to inspect the affairs of the consulate. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (March 23rd) on the Qingdao Maru of the Japanese Da Yun Steamship Company. He arrived at about 10:00 AM and went to the Cathay Mansions apartment on Baishi Road by car with the embassy welcome staff. The ambassador came to Shanghai alone this time. There were two secretaries who went directly to Chongqing from Ping the day before to arrange the residence for the ambassador to stay in Chongqing. It is said that the ambassador will have a three- or four-day meeting with friends and relatives in Shanghai before leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong and transferring to Chongqing to visit the central government officials. After the official business in Chongqing, he will transfer to Shanghai again for a longer stay.

### Two Employees of the Bank of Communications Kidnapped

No. 13 Sanyi Lane, Jisi Feier Road, in the Shanghai Western Extra-Territorial Road-Building Area, is a dormitory for employees of the Bank of Communications. Suddenly, at about 11 o'clock late the day before yesterday, armed personnel broke in and kidnapped Liang Dianxiang (from Guangdong), an employee of the Nanjing Road branch of the bank, and Zhang Linzhe (from Suzhou), an employee of the trust department. After the bank employees who lived in the lane heard the news, they were all panic-stricken and fled.

### Rice and Grain from Saigon Harbor Have Been Approved for Shipment to Shanghai

The authorities in the Settlement were concerned that the frequent rise in rice prices was detrimental to the security of the Settlement. It was generally believed that in order to stabilize the food supply for the people, it was first necessary to punish rice speculators and smooth the source of supply to increase the stock. After actively trying to smooth the source of foreign rice, some signs have been obtained. In addition to negotiating for rice-loading ships, the governments of Saigon, Siam, Yangon, Hong Kong, and other places have also responded to Shanghai, approving the shipment of large quantities of foreign rice to Shanghai for adjustment. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce will facilitate the purchase of rice and grain in the area. It is understood that the authorities have separately notified the rice merchants to purchase in large quantities from foreign rice-producing areas within a time limit to be transported to Shanghai for adjustment and to increase the stock of food for the people. Yesterday, in the rice market, speculators tried to raise prices by taking advantage of the gold price fluctuations, but in the end, prices only rose slightly due to the continuous supply. It is expected that after the authorities announce measures to suppress rice prices, prices should fall further.

### Repeated Wars in Northern Jiangsu; A Large Number of Mails Returned

Recently, there have been repeated and intense mobile wars in Northern Jiangsu, such as Taixing, Huangqiao, Hong Kong, Jiangyan, and Tianxing Port. The Shanghai Post Office received a large number of mails returned from the area yesterday, all stamped by the local post office with "The situation in the area is special and cannot be delivered."

### My Thoughts on Three-Three-Four (Continued)

— Qiu Xifu

Halfway from the garden gate, an elderly Russian woman was slowly walking along, leading a child of three or four years old. Suddenly, the child wanted to walk and play on his own, so the old woman gave him a small iron shovel she had brought – likely her grandson or grandson – and the child started digging and shoveling randomly on the ground. I thought, when this child grows up, he will surely be another foreign hero who builds his own career from scratch. "Give them an iron shovel to start a business in China!" This educational slogan immediately came to my mind!

It wasn't a mirage. On a bench near the garden gate facing the Huangpu River, I spotted the Jewish man with the large leather bag again. What was strange was that he was chatting and laughing with another woman.

Crossing the tram tracks on the Bund, at the corner of the Palace Hotel on the main road, I saw a Jewish man selling postcards beckoning to me. He was selling colored postcards for one dollar and eight sheets, and Shanghai scenic photos for twenty-five cents and forty cents each. I spent forty cents to buy a "Bund Panorama" - see the illustration in this article - the original had a statue of Peace on the right side, which has now been cut off.

I asked him, "How long have you been in Shanghai?"

He said, "I came to Shanghai from Vienna two years ago." He was clearly an exile.

"Can you make a living by selling postcards?"

He told me that if it didn't rain and wasn't too cold, he could make a dollar or two a day, which was enough to get by. When he mentioned "cold weather," his less-than-fluent English couldn't strengthen his meaning, so he simply raised both hands to show me, describing the bitter suffering when the cold wind bites to the bone. I saw that he was wearing a raincoat, the material and color of which I couldn't distinguish under the sunlight, seeming to be composed of three natural colors: brown, yellow, and gray.

"How much money do you need to spend on living expenses each day?"

"I live in Hongkou, and the rent is sixteen yuan a month. Eating is very simple, about ten cents a meal."

"When is business the best?"

His face suddenly lit up. He pointed to the Huangpu River and then looked up at the opposite Cathay Hotel. Then he said, "When foreign ships arrive at the port, the passengers are my best customers."

He suddenly asked me, "Can you speak German?" I said I couldn't. After he explained the reason for asking, I just smiled and didn't take it seriously.

Finally, he told me that his name was Egon Eisner and thanked me for my patronage.

Separated from Eisner by a wall was the tea room of the Palace Hotel. Several seats by the window were filled with people sipping tea. The lake-green tablecloths, luxurious silver teapots, sugar bowls, ashtrays, etc., could be clearly seen by people walking on the street. There was also a melodious tune wafting out from the gaps in the window. Only when I walked to No. 15 Nanjing Road next door, in front of a flower shop, did I feel that I could no longer hear the music. Looking up, I saw a line of English words under the flower shop's sign: "Rose Lane."

What I was thinking was:

Three cents for a cup of black tea;

Three cents for a chocolate bar;

Four cents for a scenic photograph.

### Flour Merchant Pan Ruijie Escapes Kidnapping Yesterday Morning; Cabbie's Quick Thinking Locks Engine; Kidnappers Innocently Wound Victim with Gun

Pan Ruijie, a native of Baoshan, 54 years old, is a flour merchant. He owns Ruiji Flour Shop at No. 122 North Zhejiang Road. He also built a house next door named Ruilu. He usually travels in his own car, license number 3524, with Wang Wenjun as his driver. Yesterday morning at 9:30, Pan took his car to Ruiji Shop. As the car arrived at the shop entrance, Pan was just

Stepping out of the car

When suddenly several kidnappers rushed forward, stopped Pan, forced him into the car, and drove away. At that time, the driver Wang Wenjun, seeing this situation, knew things were bad. With quick and nimble movements, he turned off the car's engine and took the key, jumped out of the car, and ran into Longji Lane opposite to the west. The kidnappers, seeing Wang escape from the car, knew they were exposed, so they also got out of the car one after another. One kidnapper fired a shot at Pan with a Mauser pistol,

Hitting his right ankle

The robbers then fled to the southwest. After the French Concession Police received the report, Hua Tantang Shang Wuhua, patrol officer Liu Yaying, and detective Zhao Ziduo rushed to investigate. They found a Mauser pistol shell at the scene. Because the injury to Pan was not fatal, he was still able to walk. An ambulance was called and he was sent to the hospital for treatment. Wang Wenjun and others were taken back to the police station to inquire about the faces of the kidnappers, in preparation for

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Stepping Up in Turmoil; HSBC's Listings All Contracted; Buying of Sterling and US Dollars is Booming

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listings were sterling at 3/2/0625, US dollars at 5.1875. In the unofficial market for sterling and US dollars, prices continued to rise amid chaos, which was caused by a series of unfortunate events in the financial sector. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the French Concession would allow the use of a certain bank's banknotes from today, so short sellers were panicked and rushed to cover their positions, buying over a hundred thousand pounds in sterling and over a million dollars in US dollars. The foreign firms also settled their accounts, and it was rumored that American banks were also buying. Although HSBC and Chartered Bank supplied US dollars at 5.0625 and 5.21875 at times, and rumors of international tensions caused a slight pullback, speculators bought another 500,000 yuan after hearing the Central Bank had been bombed. In the end, the day closed at a tight price, with sterling at 3/2/203125 and US dollars at 5.21875, up .0625 and .125, respectively. The futures market followed a similar pattern. At the close, the four-month US dollar was difficult to settle at 5.1875.

Speculators Initiate, Foreign Firms Follow

In the early morning, the Shanghai to Sterling, to US Dollar, and US Dollar to Shanghai rates were all stable, with the US Dollar to Sterling rate unchanged and the US Dollar to Shanghai rate up slightly by a quarter. The Central Bank's listings for all rates remained the same. The banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning, with Sterling at 3/2/25 and the US Dollar at 5.3125, Sterling up .015625 and the US Dollar down .03125 from Saturday. After the opening, speculators were the first to cover their positions, and American banks also showed an appetite, causing the market to step up. HSBC announced its listings, with Sterling contracted by .0625 and the US Dollar also contracted by .1875. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged. Foreign firms then followed suit, with trades opening for the March and April US dollar at 5.25 and 5.2875, supplied by HSBC, Chartered Bank, and others, totaling five to six hundred thousand US dollars. By about ten o'clock, spot Sterling had softened to 3/2/203115 and spot US Dollar had tightened to 5.21875. Later buyers eased up, and foreign banks showed some willingness to sell at 5.21875, so the US Dollar pulled back slightly. At the close of midday, Sterling was still reported at 3/2/203125 and the US Dollar at 5.25.

Foreign Banks Show Little Willingness to Supply

Speculators returned to activity in the afternoon market, and the market softened slightly, but soon turned flat as negative news from abroad, Shanghai Bank, the Mainland and Chartered Bank, and HSBC also released tens of thousands of pounds of March and April Sterling. The US Dollar was back from 5.21875 to 5.25. However, after 3:00 PM, when the Central Bank was bombed, foreign firms suddenly rushed to cover their positions, and the banks showed little willingness to supply, and the market was potentially tight. At the close, the spot Sterling was reported at 3/2/203125 and the US Dollar at 5.21875. The March rate was the same as the upfront price. The four-month Sterling was at 3/2/1875 and the US Dollar was at 5.1875. The result was a tightening of .0625 and a softening of .125 compared to the spot and futures rates at the end of last week.

### In a Chaotic Situation, the Gold Market Charges Wildly; High Point Seen at 6,720 Yuan

Yesterday's spot market for gold was increasingly volatile. The violent attacks caused speculators to speculate wildly, and the rumors of a withdrawal shocked people. The market jumped to 6,720 yuan at the opening, which was inevitably too high. Major players took profits and dumped gold, and the exchange rate stopped tightening. The price fell to 6,600 yuan, and then to 6,570 yuan, where gold and securities firms bought, pushing it up by nearly 100 yuan. At noon, it was seen falling again. In the afternoon, the Pacific situation tightened, and the Shanghai Western Gang increased its long positions, and the exchange rate weakened again. The news of the Central Bank being attacked led to a resurgence of the rising trend before the evening close, and it rose to 6,680 yuan, up another 201 yuan. After the close, it jumped again to 6,720 yuan. The total trading volume was 78,000 taels. The sell-off of swaps (March to April) was offered at 50 yuan, but no trades were made. For cash, 20 taels were bought by a certain silver firm and 20 taels of Beijing Qingyun were sold by Tongfeng Heng in the afternoon. Silver firms also traded 20 taels among themselves, with prices all 250 yuan higher than the futures delivery price. The price of ornamental gold rose by 20 to 710 yuan. The price of Guanjin was not changed.

Spot Gold Soars by More Than 200 Yuan

In the early morning, at around 9:00, the open interest market rose sharply, due to news that the exchange market was tightening. The short sellers were eager to cover their positions, and the market was firm. There were many buyers at the listed price (the opening price), but very few sellers. Later, the price increased by 5 yuan, then 10 yuan. The market opened at 6,700 yuan, 221 yuan higher than Saturday. In the chaotic situation, it rose again by 20 yuan, reaching 6,720 yuan. Very few transactions took place. The price was inevitably too high, and the exchange market had stabilized. The US dollar for this month could be settled again at 5.25, triggering the release of gold by major players. Dafeng, Hengji, Decheng, and Xiangxing Yong competed to sell aggressively. It soon fell back to 6,570 yuan. Later, the exchange market weakened again, and buyers resurfaced. Hengji was the first to buy again, followed by Yida, Xianghe, and Defu. It then rose again to 6,665 yuan. As the number of buyers decreased, the Shanghai Western Gang sold off its long positions. Tianyuan and Deda sold hard, and Shunyuan, Xinfeng Yong, Defu, and Gonghe also followed suit. By noon, it had fallen back to 6,600 yuan, but relying on Hesheng and Tongkang Yong to absorb it, it ended at 6,618 yuan. The market outside the exchange traded at 6,630 yuan after the close. The opening price in the afternoon was 6,625 yuan. Because of the many favorable rumors, plus the Shanghai Western Gang returned, Tianyuan and Litai bought 4,5000 taels, resulting in a rise to 6,670 yuan. Later, news of the worsening Pacific situation caused a sharp drop in buyers. Hengji, Xiangxing Yong, Xinfeng Yong, and Xianghe sold hard, causing it to fall back to 6,620 yuan. After 3:30, buying resurfaced. Hengji turned from selling to buying, and Shunyuan urgently covered its short positions. Yiyuan Gonghe also bought before the close, causing the price to rise to 6,690 yuan. The market closed at 6,680 yuan, up a full 201 yuan. At the settlement price of the April US dollar at 5.1875, it was 6,713.25 yuan, a premium of 33.2 yuan. After the close, because the four-month US dollar was difficult to settle at 5.1875, the price broke through the 6,700 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6,720 yuan. The price rose again, with a total fluctuation of 150 yuan for the day. The current brand gold from cash gold shops and retail prices was 270 yuan higher than the futures delivery price. The purchase price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for current brand gold.

### Food Grains: Imported Rice Market Rose First, Then Fell Yesterday

The market for imported rice was up in the morning, flat at noon, and fell sharply in the afternoon. The major players were taking advantage of the situation, claiming that the gold price was rising and the exchange rate was contracting (in fact, the gold price was falling and the exchange rate was rising, and the rice price should not have loosened), and because the market was closed the previous day, there was a lot of movement among the retailers and floating speculators. The spot price continued to rise by two or three yuan. As soon as the price was raised, the actual sales decreased, and floating speculators saw that there was surplus profit and took advantage of the high prices to sell. The merchants also pushed large quantities of spot goods, and the rising trend was thwarted. The results were all below the posted price. The Baixin Xiaowen price rose from 4,100 yuan to 3,900 yuan. The Zhongguan price rose from 3,800 or 3,900 yuan to 3,600 or 3,700 yuan. The No. 2 Saigon price rose from 3,700 yuan to 3,500 yuan. The No. 1 Saigon high-quality price rose from 3,400 yuan to 3,200 or 3,300 yuan. The Jue price rose from 3,200 yuan to 3,100 yuan or 3,000 yuan. Only the No. 1 Siam rice and Huojiao rice were less popular and there was little change, with prices always around 3,400 or 3,500 yuan. The Suijian price fell from 2,200 yuan to 3,000 yuan or 2,800 yuan or 2,900 yuan. The statistics show that prices rose and fell, but the Saigon rice prices in the afternoon were all 4 or 500 yuan lower, and there were few buyers. Therefore, although the prices rose by 3 or 4 yuan in the morning, the evening close was actually 3 or 4 yuan lower than Saturday's close. The total volume traded was more than 20,000 bags.

Large quantities of imported rice continued to arrive at the port. The Yihuo Company's Rigsdaal arrived two days ago (23rd), carrying 12,564 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The Taikoo Company's Anhui arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, also carrying 15,316 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at the company's wharf in Pudong to unload. The 2,000 bags of flour mentioned in the report yesterday that were shipped to Yantai were actually "Bao Mi" (corn), and the word "flour" was misprinted. This is a correction.

The thin and thick Japonica rice and other national rice, after a sharp sale before the week, yesterday, the first day after the holiday, caused the local retailers to take advantage of the low prices to buy, and the goods were sold smoothly. Also, because there were not many arrivals, there was a rumor of continued price increases for imported rice in the early morning. The owners were firm, and under the pressure, prices rose together. However, there were differences in the prices of the two Japonica rice. The price of the thin rice had already fallen sharply, so it rose more this time, by about two yuan. The opening price of Qingjiao rice was 114 yuan or 112.5 yuan for the thin rice, and 120 yuan or 119 yuan for the original package. The thick Japonica rice only rose by one yuan. The opening price of Changbang Japonica rice was 125 or 126 yuan for the special Japonica rice, and 123 yuan for the general rice. The Kunshan Japonica rice was 121 yuan for the white Japonica rice with high quality, falling to 117 yuan.

Glutinous rice was also actively traded, and because of the low prices, those who held the goods continued to raise the prices, and the market was firm. As a result, the Hong Kong special glutinous rice opened at 110 yuan, and the general cargo opened at 108 yuan to 106 yuan. The special glutinous rice tea even opened at 105 yuan, and the general price was 98 yuan for the entire grain, and 90 yuan for broken rice, a sharp increase of more than 3 yuan.

### Flour Market Still Speculating

The flour market rose first and then remained flat. The rising trend was strong at the opening of the market. Because of the sudden rumors on Saturday, in the midst of rising gold and shrinking exchange rates, local retailers and speculators took the opportunity to buy, and the holders took the opportunity to speculate, with the Flower and Crow Clock Tower brand Australian flour jumping to 30.34 yuan, and the Golden Dragon brand Camp flour was 29.56 yuan, but in the afternoon it was suddenly reported that a large number of Camp flour had been imported, and after the rice price rose and then fell, the actual sales were sluggish, and the Flower and Crow brand returned to 29.8 yuan, and the Golden Dragon brand was also down by three or four jiao. The total transaction volume was more than 10,000 bags, and the market situation was gradually brewing. It is said that the situation will change depending on whether the arrivals are confirmed.

The wheat market remains sluggish. The arrivals from the inland areas have been scarce for a long time, and the supply in the market is limited. It can be said that there is a market but no goods. The price of high-quality Du wheat is currently around 45 yuan. Because the flour market is firm, the situation is stable.

Imported flour continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Anhui arrived at the port. In addition to a large amount of imported rice from Hong Kong, there were also 1,000 bags of flour. The Yihuo Company's Rigsdaal arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (23rd), and also loaded a large amount of imported flour, 18,964 bags.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Slightly Cheaper, Then Soars; Only Speculators Have Wolfish Nature

The soybean oil market has been relatively stable recently, with each catty selling for a little more than one yuan, and raw oil selling for twelve ounces for one yuan. It is now difficult to make a living, and there is no choice but to choose the cheaper option. In this world, only speculators have a wolfish nature and are not afraid of bloodshed, so they are attacking soybean oil again. The buying interest in the market is strong, and general speculators are also active. As a result, spot prices soared by six yuan, and futures prices soared by five yuan. Factory oil rose by two yuan, while peanut oil changed little. According to statistics, 300 dans of factory oil from Dayou were traded, raising the price to 100 yuan. 200 barrels of Dalian oil were priced at 133 yuan to 135 yuan. A further 650 barrels were ordered for delivery in April, with prices ranging from 130.75 yuan to 136.75 yuan. In addition, more than 1,000 barrels were ordered for delivery in late April, with prices ranging from 135.75 yuan to 138.5 yuan. The transaction price for peanut oil was 4,000 cans of Jiangbei local mill-packed oil at 152 yuan, 200 cans of Yantai canned oil at 151 to 6 yuan, and 50 pieces of Yantai packaged oil at 114 yuan.

On the 25th, 150 bags of exported soybeans, 626 pieces of soybean cake, and 234 bags of sesame were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Securities - Attention to the Domination of the "Tong," "Ding," and "Du He" - External Stocks Rise and Immediately Fall

The unofficial market for government bonds was extremely chaotic yesterday. Sentiment was still bullish, but the situation in Shanghai was unsettling, leading to selling at every high point, making support difficult. In this uncertain era, people are uneasy, and it's best to be calm and do less. Accidental losses would be a small matter. The Benxiong incident is a localized problem and shouldn't cause unexpected disputes, so government bonds are still stable. Yesterday's transactions included Xinfu buying in the morning, with Wenkanghong, Dada Tong, and Fengdelong also buying. Lianhe, Hengkang, Hu Heji, and Lemao were selling. Initially, Type C bonds reached the six-yuan mark and then rose steadily, eventually breaking through it, closing at six yuan and five jiao. The market outlook is promising. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to buy aggressively, paying special attention to Type D bonds, acquiring a significant amount. Other firms like Tongkang and Lianyi also showed strong buying interest. Type C bonds rose another one or two jiao at the opening, but then Renfeng, Hu Heji, and others sold heavily, while Lianyi offered substantial amounts of Type B and D bonds, causing the market to turn downward again. Type D bonds were supported by Xinfu, resulting in a rise of six jiao compared to last week. Other types fell back by about two jiao, except for Type A, which fell by five jiao and a half, suffering the most significant loss. The total transaction volume was 1.2 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below:

Stock trading: 100 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of eight yuan and one yuan. Huashang Electric shares were bid at eight yuan, one jiao and a half, but no sales occurred.

### Yarn and Cotton - Actual Sales Stagnant - Yarn Market Unable to Rise Directly - Speculators Alone Shorting

The yarn market rose and then stabilized, but the trend is firm with a soft underbelly. This is because actual sales are weak, so despite the surge in margin calls and the exchange rate reduction, yarn prices have not risen accordingly. However, after the exchange rate tightening, the factory's raw material prices are high, increasing costs. Therefore, some hoarders who have absorbed inventory are still unwilling to give up. Securities firms have shifted from short to long positions, but some in the industry, like XX, are shorting, intensifying the battle between the two sides. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,439 yuan, and the low price was 1,416 yuan. The initial transaction in the afternoon was at 1,416 yuan, then rose to 1,424 yuan, and then fell back to 1,417 yuan, with the final price at 1,435 yuan. Today, 555 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, and 165 bales were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning with enthusiastic sentiment. The opening price was 1,420 yuan, and soon fell to 1,417 yuan. Shortly after, it was heard that margin calls opened up at a jump of 200 yuan, igniting a buying frenzy in the market. Buyers were agitated, and the price immediately rose to 1,439 yuan. However, some profit-takers sold off, and the gold market eased slightly, causing the market to loosen and fall to 1,421 yuan. This trend recovered to 1,430 yuan, but the market wasn't smooth and fell back to 1,418 yuan at the close. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 7,450 bales were sold. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below:

Hong Kong: 160 bales
Counterparts: 7,250 bales
Southeast Asia: 40 bales
Total: 7,450 bales

### Cotton Sales Lively - Indian Cotton Arriving via Hong Kong

The current cotton situation remains high due to the shrinking exchange rate and positive sentiment, but actual transactions have not fully developed. However, trading among industry players is lively. Yesterday, a total of 2,064 bales were traded, with prices up by one or two yuan. The current cotton market prices are recorded below:

The New York cotton market was calm and mixed. At the close, it fell due to selling by Southern firms, resulting in a decrease of three or four pounds compared to the previous day's closing price.

The Indian cotton market was very flat, rising and falling by turns. Yesterday's closing prices showed fluctuations of about two rupees. It is predicted that today's opening price will rise by more than three rupees.

Also, according to a report from Bombay, from September 1st of last year to March 22nd of this year, Indian cotton...

Another report from Shanghai states that the trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is once again lively. Factories have been purchasing rapidly every day, and trading among industry players is even more active. It is expected that due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the surge in pure gold, and the rising trend in the yarn market, a competitive situation will unfold in the coming days.

The annual volume of Indian cotton imported into China is substantial, with most of it shipped from Bombay or Calcutta by British merchants. Due to the European war, the number of British ships operating on the Far East routes has decreased. A small number of central ships still operate, but only go as far as Hong Kong and do not come to Shanghai. Therefore, the shipment of Indian cotton to Shanghai has significantly decreased. However, Japanese merchants are purchasing and shipping directly via Japanese ships, with some being transported to Hong Kong and then transshipped to Shanghai. It is reported that Taikoo's Nanchang arrived the day before yesterday (the 22nd), carrying 7,437 bales of Indian cotton transshipped from Hong Kong. The Anhui arrived in Shanghai yesterday, also carrying 1,206 bales transshipped from Hong Kong. (Zu)

### Piece Goods - Cloth Sales Stagnant

The factory cloth market rose yesterday, influenced by the shrinking exchange rate. However, actual sales are stagnant, and hoarding has reached saturation, so the upward trend has become gradual. White goods and expensive fine cloth opened at 44 yuan and five jiao in the morning, and were transacted at 44 yuan and seven jiao and a half in the afternoon, an increase of seven jiao and a half per bolt compared to last Saturday. Other fine cloths and twills also increased by five jiao to one yuan. Coarse cloths from factories like Jardine Matheson opened at prices up two and a half jiao to five jiao. Bleached cloths and poplin were flat, while blue cloths and colored twills increased by five jiao. About 500 bolts of various cloths were traded on the street.

The fundraising goal of 50,000 yuan has not yet been reached. The committee has extended the fundraising deadline by one month (until April 15th) and sent letters to schools in Shanghai requesting assistance in establishing the Shanghai Children's Library.

### Short-Lived Rickshaw Pullers

— Huanjun

Pulling a rickshaw is the most common occupation among the working class, with tens of thousands in Shanghai alone. They rely on their legs to make a living, running through the streets all day long, enduring the onslaught of severe cold and scorching heat, wind, frost, rain, and snow. They can truly be called extremely hardworking. Moreover, their eating, working, and sleeping schedules are irregular, and because of ignorance or lack of time, they almost never pay attention to hygiene. They often eat a full meal and immediately start pulling the rickshaw. Sometimes, they even stuff half a pancake into their mouths while a customer is calling, accepting the business and rushing off to pull the rickshaw. The intense strain is undoubtedly harmful to their gastrointestinal digestion, which is enough to shorten their lifespan. Therefore, rickshaw pullers rarely live long.

I have seen many examples of the short lifespans of rickshaw pullers. In the past, when I lived in the Nanshi area, I had three rickshaw pullers lodging one after another under the overhanging building at the entrance of the alley. None of these three lived to old age. The first one was only in his thirties. After pulling a rickshaw for two years, he pulled away his life. The second one lived to be just over forty. The last one to come and live there was a young and strong man, around thirty years old. He pulled the rickshaw as fast as flying, and he was very honest. People called him "A Geng." At the time, I thought that such a strong man would not have a short life. When I first saw him, he seemed as powerful as a wild bull. However, in less than two years, the work forced him to become a lazy, stove-hugging cat. When he pulled the rickshaw, he was as slow as he could be. In the fourth year, he eventually died of severe stomach disease. It is truly shocking that such a strong man only lived to be in his thirties.

This is a great tragedy in society. How should we save them?

### Night Walker

— Cangzi

The darkness before dawn blankets everything on earth. Even the uneven cobblestone road made of countless fragments of stone slabs has lost its reflective properties. The night walker, without a glowing lamp in hand, walks his endless journey. Darkness is the vanguard of light, the night walker thinks. Perhaps thorns lie across the path in the darkness, and brambles recline. They will tear the night walker's clothes and even trip him. Of course, the night walker must pull aside the brambles or get up and continue his endless journey. He will not entertain for a moment the thought of "turning back" or "sitting here and waiting for dawn before continuing." Because he knows that if he has this thought in the darkness, it would be better to think of "suicide."

Everything must have a journey, and it will not be an easy one. When a baby is born, it must fight against cold, heat, hunger, and disease. As it grows, it constantly struggles against the shackles of social tradition and the constraints of life. When a seed falls into the soil, it must compete with birds, insects, and animals. As it grows, it is constantly exposed to the blows of wind and rain and the "torment" of frost and snow, which give it a chance of dying at any time. Therefore, the journey of anything is either a painful struggle or the pain of struggle. The growth of a new force will inevitably encounter the oppression and destruction of the old forces, and the betrayal and obstruction of rebels. His journey is formed in attack and sacrifice.

Everything must have a journey, and this journey is painful.

Humanity is divided into three teams on the painful journey:

One team is subjugated by the torment of pain and becomes captives and slaves of the oppressors.

One team is passive because of pain. The vast river will become their cemetery. Even if there are any left, they are undoubtedly "quasi-slaves."

One team is the fighters. Oppression cannot subjugate them, and pain will not drive them to passivity. Only struggle and progress, which they consider the only way to eliminate all difficulties.

Certainly, subjugation means destruction, and passivity is the knocker of destruction. Only those who fight are the victors of darkness and the masters of light.

The night walker wants to move from the path of darkness to the realm of light. He uses struggle as his weapon. But someone said: aimless action is a long march forever in the dark path, and it will not be able to absorb the nourishing air of light. That's right. But our night walker (that is, the fighter) has firm confidence and strong will. Isn't this his grasp? With this, he sees clearly the grain of each cobblestone. There will be no signs of "no passage." The night walker said so.

### The Power of Superstition

— Luhan

Where I live is a building that is like a warehouse, like a hotel, and like an apartment. There is smoking, gambling, and... more than that, there is superstition.

The atmosphere of superstition is very strong here. Merit-making ceremonies, Taoist rituals, Buddhist ceremonies—everything is available here. Monks, Taoists, nuns, and Buddhist grandmas are employed here year-round. When someone dies in one house, they perform the seventh-day and eighth-day rites. When someone dies in another house, there is constant "ke-ke-dong-dong" from morning till night, making your head spin. All of this is nothing. What's more interesting is that there are taboos about everything, even though every household has a red paper sign posted on their door that says, "Grand Duke is here, no taboos." People are constantly violating taboos and running into bad luck. There are so many people running into bad luck here. For example, if someone delivering medicine "delivers the prescription and sends the medicine" to the wrong person, then that person thinks he has run into bad luck and insists that the person who delivered the medicine buy incense and candles and kowtow to apologize in front of everyone. Spending money and kowtowing, the person delivering the medicine is having bad luck, so he will not run into bad luck at his house. There is also a rule about drying clothes here: women's pants cannot be hung at the crossroads. It is said that walking under women's pants that are hanging up is also bad luck. This makes it difficult for women, because the drying platform here is only enough for the second landlord's family to use. A courtyard without a sky is a good place for dozens of families to dry clothes. This courtyard is the only way to go in and out, so water often drips on your head. Today, probably some clueless woman hung her pants in the courtyard. In less than five minutes, someone with a special interest in women's pants discovered it. It's terrible, the case is solved, scolding starts, and the whole warehouse is in turmoil. The pants were thrown away. Those who usually have a grudge against this woman do not want to let go of this excellent opportunity, seize her weakness, and start shouting righteously and menacingly, scolding the woman until she is covered in dog blood. Strangely enough, the woman, who is usually not very kind, knows that she is wrong today, hides her head in the house, and dares not come out, listening calmly to their challenges and never daring to reply. But I feel a little angry for the woman. Even if she is not convinced by the punishment of the law, she wants to appeal. Now, she has been convicted and punished by a baseless superstition, but she is obedient and breathless, not wanting to resist at all. Ah! The power of traditional superstition is stronger than the law.

### Wandering in Loneliness

— Manxiu

Mom was lying in bed, barely breathing. Mom said, "Xiu, I'm going to die! Make me proud!" I said, "Mom, don't worry! I will, I will definitely make you proud!" Mom nodded and told my sister, "You are the oldest. After I die, take good care of your younger siblings!" As she spoke, she looked at Dad and died with tears in her eyes!

Mom closed her eyes and died quietly! Leaving us three siblings, as desolate as an isolated island! Dad said we were too young, so he married a stepmother for us. On the day she entered the house, the three of us, wearing filial piety with shame, greeted the new mother. My sister and I both cried secretly! Dad looked at the younger brother in the nanny's arms and felt very uncomfortable. Later, my sister pulled Dad aside and said, "Dad! Don't forget our Mom!" Dad agreed! I said I clearly remember how we spent that night.

From then on, we had a "mother"! We waited for the "mother's" love and looked forward to the "mother's" care and comfort. We even hoped that one day we would forget our own mom! But we were very strange. Different moods created unavoidable conflicts, and the distance between mother and daughter grew wider. Dad's intentional flattery highlighted our sadness even more. After all, Dad is just Dad! We wandered in loneliness, we roamed in solitude, and we only looked enviously at our sister's happiness and the happiness of others.

My sister followed what Mom said on her deathbed and raised us. My younger brother is also jumping on the tram to go to school. Mom! I will, I will definitely make you proud!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(V) The Demarcation between Love and Desire

This signal was really effective, and a very light and lively footstep came out soon. After a while, the second gate opened, and standing on the stone steps was a young woman in cloth clothes and a cloth skirt, dressed exactly like a female student. A lovely and sincere smile floated on her face without powder. Who else could this be? Of course, it was Luo Xiangqi, whom Begonia had been thinking about all the time for the past two days.

"You're early!" She turned her body to the side, allowing Begonia to walk into the second door in a state of surprise and joy.

In the main hall of the second courtyard, there was a square table with a white tablecloth, on which was enshrined a memorial tablet and candlesticks and incense burners, which immediately reminded Begonia of what Xiangqi mentioned in her letter about her mother, who had been deceived and whose illness had worsened, causing her to pass away soon after.

Xiangqi led him into the side rooms on both sides.

"Would you mind waiting here for a while?" Xiangqi first asked him to sit down in a chair, then smiled slightly and ran into the back very lively.

Begonia tried his best to calm his mind and looked up to look around the room. It was a rectangular room, simply furnished but very clean. There was no air of wealth, only an ancient and quiet charm. On the north wall hung a narrow group photo. Begonia went over to take a look and knew that it was taken when Xiangqi graduated from the First Women's Normal School. The people in the photo were only the size of a finger, but in less than half a second, he immediately found Wei Xiangqi. He looked at that bean-sized face in detail and felt very familiar, as if this person had been living with him for more than ten years!

New Movie Introduction

### "The Spoilers"

— Deng Shiying

Many people say the actors in "The Spoilers" are good. I agree. With the past acting skills of four "stars"—Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Claudette Colbert, and Hedy Lamarr—as a guarantee, it is reasonable to say that "The Spoilers" is worth watching for its acting.

But I think the excellence of the four "stars" themselves is secondary to "The Spoilers" becoming a good show. The most important thing is that the story of this show has broken away from the usual American movie love clichés, and the control of the characters has not harmed the show with people. —In the past, we have seen too many shows produced under the "star system" that killed the show and the "stars" themselves.

The "star" itself is not a sin. In Hollywood, the word "star" is at least built on acting skills; (it is far less so than in our Chinese film industry. After becoming a "star," he faces the crisis of being "restricted." The shows specially written for a certain star often kill the show and the star. One of the greatest benefits of "The Spoilers" is that the actors are not subject to such rigid restrictions. Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy both fit their characters. Although Hedy Lamarr does not have many scenes, she gives us a strong impression due to the director's proper handling. Claudette Colbert is relatively wronged. Although her "good wife and mother" is very energetic, it is inferior to her several previous comedies.

"The Spoilers" has a very moving story. Two muscular, brave, and irritable men fall in love with the same woman. When one discovers that his friend's wife is the lover he has been missing, he silently endures the pain and retreats. Later, he fought with his friend for the happiness of his lover, but when his friend's career failed and he was almost imprisoned after bankruptcy, he stood up to testify to acquit his friend.

In the production of the script, the author broke away from the usual American film handling of love, but the arrangement of the scenes was not appropriate, and even seemed a little disorganized and jumpy. The reason is that the material was not well woven, so that at first glance, there is a lot of material and complicated plots. This is "business material" in our Chinese films, but it has made the screenwriters suffer in American films that advocate simplicity.

"The Spoilers" is adapted from the novel by James Edward Grant. I don't know how the original work is. In retrospect, the somewhat chaotic scene arrangement may have been influenced by the chapter divisions of the novel; therefore, the author's cleverness is shown in the dividing shots. The example of knocking down three hooligans and putting them together, as well as the appearance of Hedy Lamarr after the two people fought (using close-ups when the two are fighting is also a very clever method). In addition, the use of small objects to regulate the air in the passing scene, so that the play does not fall into dullness, are all examples.

"The Spoilers" is a play I like.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter III Recalling Lord Pingyuan

So Li Xin, Zhang Cangqiu, Chen Fei, and Xu Jing all drank the cup of wine in front of them, which shows that everyone agreed. Li Xin was very happy and asked his family to prepare everything. After the banquet, everyone sat and talked for a while, and before they knew it, it was late. However, sacrifices and idols had already been prepared in the hall, incense and candles were lit, and the ground was covered with red felt. Li Xin and his men first paid homage to heaven and earth and wrote a list of sworn brothers. Zhang Cangqiu was older and the eldest brother, Chen Fei was the second, Li Xin was the third, and Xu Jing was the fourth. After greeting each other, everyone called each other brothers. Li Xin then invited his wife, Xing, to come out and meet them, and the servants also came up to congratulate them. Several of Li Xin's retainers also came to congratulate him. Li Xin held a grand banquet in the hall, inviting his three brothers and retainers to drink together. The servants were also rewarded, and the festivities lasted until midnight before dispersing. That night, Zhang Cangqiu still followed Xu Jing back to his residence and agreed that Chen Fei would set off the next afternoon. Li Xin and Xu Jing also planned to hold another banquet in the village to see them off. The next day, Zhang Cangqiu got up at dawn and talked with Xu Jing for a moment, saying that if they made meritorious service and were promoted there, they would ask someone to send a letter back. Zhang Cangqiu wanted Xu Jing to go outside as well. However, Xu Jing regretted that he could not follow because his old mother was still alive. After breakfast, Zhang Cangqiu went to bid farewell to his mother, gave Liu San several taels of silver, and then put on his precious knife and carried the parcel that had already been prepared. The four of them talked for a while, and the sun was already at noon. Li Xin and Xu Jing, as the hosts, set up a banquet to see the two of them off. Everyone drank heartily. After the banquet, Zhang Cangqiu was ready to leave immediately. Li Xin, because Chen Fei did not have a mount, took a green horse from his stable and gave it to him, and also presented two hundred taels of silver to the two sworn brothers as travel expenses. The two of them were not polite and accepted them all, bid farewell and left. Li Xin and Xu Jing each rode a horse and saw them off for more than ten miles before reluctantly saying goodbye. Li Xin and Xu Jing rode back to Li's Manor. As they approached the gate, they saw a large group of people gathered on the square over there, with gongs and drums sounding, and they didn't know what kind of tricks they were doing. Li Xin's manor had never allowed people from the Jianghu to sell their fists and arts there. If he wanted to give them some money, he would be willing to, but he would not allow exceptions. So, when he saw this, he felt a little annoyed, spurred his horse and went to the crowd.

### A Striving Philosophy of Life

Spirit is a kind of atom. The compound produced by striving and matching with reality is power. Therefore, the power of struggle is a chemical change, not a physical change. You don't have to estimate power, but use struggle to change your power.
