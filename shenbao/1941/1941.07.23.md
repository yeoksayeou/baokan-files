### Roosevelt Asks Congress to Extend Military Service Term by One Year; Current International Situation Worsening; Maintaining Current Military Strength is Necessary

Reuter's, Washington, 22nd - President Roosevelt yesterday requested Congress to extend the military service term by one year, stating briefly that for national security, two steps had been taken last year: first, the implementation of the Selective Service Act for one year of military training, making this the primary responsibility of citizens; second, the commencement of the organization and training of field armies, with the aim of preparing an army of over one million well-organized troops in times of emergency. Today's situation is not only not easing compared to a year ago, but is worsening daily. Anyone aware of this fact realizes the necessity of maintaining the efficiency of the army and not reducing its preparedness in the slightest. The American army is smaller compared to other countries' armies and should especially not be allowed to become disorganized. If Congress does not find a way to maintain the current military strength and continue training new recruits to the extent possible, then within two months, those who have already received training will continue to be discharged, causing two-thirds of the trained soldiers and three-quarters of the officers to be demobilized and return home. This would be a grave mistake and would bring disaster to the nation. I do not believe that the danger to American security is less than a year ago, or even similar to a year ago. I feel that today's danger is far beyond comparison to a year ago. Some may think that America does not need to worry about foreign aggression against itself or other American nations, but those who are in daily contact with current events, such as naval and military officers and government officials, are all acutely aware that the aggressor nations' plans against America are now becoming increasingly clear, and that America and other American nations are in danger in terms of national security. This is why, after careful consideration of all matters, I have declared that a state of unlimited national emergency already exists. Millions of patriotic Americans, while living peaceful lives, may not always pay attention to the various developments abroad. Therefore, I must reiterate that the continuous attacks of the past few years, from the annexation of Austria to the current war against Russia, the actions spanning across Europe and extending to Asia and Africa, are all proceeding according to a predetermined plan. Each time, they utilize not only superior weaponry but also the overwhelming advantage in trained troops, first providing guarantees of security or non-aggression to the victims, rendering them unprepared, and then, when the opportunity arises, tearing up the treaties and launching wars against them. Every war is like this. Now, the forces of Nazism are approaching the Western Hemisphere, and their propaganda and conspiracies, attempting to undermine the unity of the Americas as a large family, are incessant. I believe that no department of the American government wants to see the Americas suffer the same fate of losing independence as other countries. We Americans cannot gamble with the security of America. We also have a real responsibility to the nations of the Western Hemisphere, which is to assist them in resisting foreign aggression. I believe that no department of the government wants to abandon our Pan-American agreements or abandon the policy we have been pursuing for over 125 years. If we do not violate this historical policy, then we have a responsibility to uphold it. Now, if we weaken our army's strength at this critical juncture, it would, in my view, be a grave breach of faith with our neighbors. Time is of the essence. If Congress does not find a way, then within two months, the American army will appear disorganized, and Congress will be responsible for it. After the aforementioned message was released, Mr. May, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, proposed two resolutions: one to extend the term of service for soldiers, and one to abolish the limits on the number of draftees, but did not declare the existence of a state of emergency on the part of Congress. At the same time, Senator Thomas, Chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, proposed a bill stipulating the declaration of a state of national emergency, but limiting the President's powers under a state of emergency, only to retaining draftees and National Guard troops.

Reuter's, London, 22nd - The Daily Telegraph reported that President Roosevelt's message to Congress, urgently recommending the extension of national service obligations, proves that the President, as a leader supported by the country, is wholeheartedly dedicated to his duty. If the recommendation to extend military service is not approved, the United States will be exposed to significant danger. This is a simple fact.

### Sumida Returns to Japan

Reuter's, Hanoi, 22nd - Sumida, the leader of the Japanese military mission stationed in Vietnam, recently flew back to Tokyo. The reason for this is being kept secret by Japanese officials. Whether Sumida carried any requests regarding the Japanese use of naval bases in southern Vietnam is currently unknown. Mr. Saito, a representative of the Japanese mission in Saigon, has been here to see Sumida for three days and will fly back to Saigon today. There has been no new progress regarding Governor Decoux's arrival here, but it is widely expected that he will meet with Sumida soon. People here are paying close attention to Darlan's meeting with the Japanese ambassador in Vichy, and it is believed that Vichy will be the focal point of developments within the next few days.

### British Diplomatic Circles Speculate: Japan Will Attack Vietnam; Vichy Government May Not Resist; United States Will Intensify Sanctions Against Japan

United Press, London, 22nd - Diplomatic circles revealed today that they expect Japan to attack southern Vietnam on Thursday or Friday. They believe that the Vichy government will not resist this new action by Japan, but the United States may react to this move by further restricting trade with Japan.

Reuter's, Chongqing, 22nd - It is generally believed that Japan is currently suppressing its decision to attack north or advance south, waiting for the international situation to continue to clarify, and it is believed that Japan may soon launch an offensive in an attempt to cut off China's important supply route, the Burma Road. Japan's current negotiations with Vietnam may be related to an imminent offensive, as Japan will likely use Vietnam as its main base for the offensive. In its offensive against the Burma Road, Japan may advance north along the railway from Lao Cai to Kunming, or move west and enter Burma, or both simultaneously. However, any attempt by Japan to enter Burma would be tantamount to placing the important center of the Burma Road within easy bombing range of Japanese aircraft, after the establishment of a Japanese military base there. People here are paying close attention to rumors that Japanese troops have withdrawn from various fronts in China and that a Japanese convoy was seen sailing south from Guangzhou.

### Former German Consul to Vietnam to Go to Japan

Reuter's, Hanoi, 22nd - According to today's news, the former German Consul-General to Vietnam, Neumann, will arrive in Tokyo on July 27th to attend the meeting of the Vietnam-Thailand border demarcation committee.

### American Reporter Ingersoll Arrives in Manila

Reuter's, Manila, 22nd - Ingersoll, the editor of the well-known New York afternoon newspaper, arrived here today and will immediately take a Clipper to Singapore, then proceed to Moscow. Upon arriving, he said that American public opinion has changed greatly and that people understand that the United States must shoulder the responsibility created by the international situation. General public opinion opposes appeasement, and any new attempts at aggression will trigger demands for direct action. Therefore, if the American troops stationed in Iceland are attacked, the American people will rise up and demand war. Americans do not care whether the Atlantic or the Pacific is more important; the American people are capable of dealing with both oceans. Although the conscription law and the Lend-Lease Act caused controversy, once they were passed, the entire nation supported them.

### Ishii Statement: No Change in Japanese Diplomacy; Third Konoe Cabinet Policy Still Based on the Tripartite Pact

United Press, Tokyo, 22nd - Cabinet Information Bureau Deputy Spokesman Ishii declared today, "Although the Cabinet has changed, Japan's foreign policy remains centered on the Tripartite Pact and there is no change." Ishii told foreign reporters that the new Foreign Minister, Lieutenant General Toyoda, invited the German and Italian ambassadors to the Foreign Ministry last Saturday to clearly explain that the policy of the Third Konoe Cabinet is to maintain the spirit and purpose of the Tripartite Pact. Asked about the withdrawal of Japanese residents from South Africa, Ishii replied that this was only due to the small scale of their businesses. The Japanese consul and part of his staff are not withdrawing. Ishii also stated that he had not received any formal news regarding the rumored American oil embargo against Japan or President Roosevelt's blacklisting of Axis representatives in South America. When asked about reports in Japanese newspapers that Britain and China were preparing to attack French Indochina by force, Ishii replied, "I hope this does not become a reality," but he also said that he had not yet received formal news regarding this matter. Ishii declined to comment on the recent meeting between Japanese Ambassador to France Kato and French Deputy Premier Darlan. Ishii also stated that the Foreign Ministry had not yet received any official reports that British or Chinese troops had entered Vietnam. When asked whether Japan had concluded an agreement with Vietnam to provide assistance if Vietnam were invaded by a third country, Ishii replied, "This depends on future developments." Ishii also announced that Soviet Ambassador Smetanin had not yet met with Foreign Minister Toyoda when discussing the German and Italian ambassadors' visit to the Foreign Ministry.

### US and India Exchange Envoys; Wilson Appointed US Minister to India; India and Burma Conclude Immigration Agreement

Havas, Washington, 21st - After the United States and India decided to exchange representatives to reside in each other's country, the Indian authorities yesterday appointed Sir Girja Shankar Bajpai as India's representative to the United States. President Roosevelt has also appointed Thomas Wilson as a representative to India, with the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary.

Reuter's, Shimla, 22nd - It was announced here today that the governments of India and Burma have agreed on an agreement to adjust and restrict the immigration of Indians into Burma, and it is stated that the two governments believe that the measures stipulated in the agreement can eliminate the Burmese people's fears that the influx of Indians will create economic competition, and allow Indian immigrants to live peacefully in Burma and have their legitimate rights recognized. This agreement will take effect from October 1st of this year.

### India Expands Import Controls; Trade with Japan Severely Affected

Reuter's, Shimla, 22nd - The Indian government has announced an expansion of import controls to preserve exchange rates with countries outside the Sterling area and to reduce the trade deficit with certain countries, especially Japan.

### US Under Secretary of State Declares Germany Has New Aggressive Intentions; But Does Not Specify the Target Country; US Promises Aid to Bolivia

Reuter's, Washington, 22nd - Under Secretary of State Welles declared yesterday while hosting journalists that, according to information received by the United States, Germany is currently planning new steps to invade the remaining independent countries in Europe. However, Welles did not elaborate on this matter. He continued to say that the United States has promised to provide full assistance to Bolivia in the event of international incidents caused by Nazi uprisings and the expulsion of Nazi envoys. Welles later mentioned the critical remarks made by Spain's Franco a week ago, saying that Franco's claim that the United States' proposal to provide economic assistance to Spain was always intended to force Spain to comply with the will of other countries was completely inaccurate. The supply of American food and medicine to Spain is not tied to the policies of the Spanish government, but is conditional on the Spanish people maintaining peace. Franco spoke of the impact of a Nazi victory on other republics in the Americas. It should be noted that the domination of the oceans being in the hands of friendly countries is vital; if such domination were in the hands of unfriendly countries, the independence of the Americas would be greatly endangered.

Havas, Santiago, Chile, 22nd - A conspiracy to revolt has recently been discovered in Cochabamba, Bolivia, involving six Germans who have been arrested by the authorities. The case involves the German Minister to Bolivia, Winter, and Bolivia has requested Germany to recall him. It is learned that the Chilean authorities are currently taking various measures, and it is rumored that the Minister may come to Antofagasta, Chile.

Editorial

### The Rise and Fall of Aggression and Anti-Aggression

The biggest problem in the current world situation does not lie in the strength of the aggressive forces, but in the weakness of the resistance forces of the anti-aggression nations in the past. Speaking of the collective power of anti-aggression, it cannot be said to be weak; the main reason why it has retreated step by step and has been occupied or ravaged one after another lies more in the anti-aggression nations themselves than in the opposing forces. The weakness of the anti-aggression forces is caused by the following points: (1) Due to differences in interests, opinions, etc., they have never been able to unite to form a confrontational front. (2) A mentality of complacency has led to military neglect. (3) Except for the Soviet Union, which is carrying out all its national construction work in a wartime posture, the rest of the countries have all shifted from peacetime to wartime. In the process of reorganizing their domestic institutions, they have given the aggressors the opportunity to launch "lightning strikes."

Although the aggressors in the West and the East have gained many benefits and occupied an unparalleled advantage in the past few years, if we speculate on the future success or failure of both sides today, we must generally pay attention to the situation of the anti-aggression nations themselves and their mutual cooperation. Assuming that they recognize the danger of the situation, are determined, strengthen unity, and are able to cooperate to the end, then the final collapse of the aggressors is only a matter of time. This basic situation cannot be changed no matter how astonishing the achievements of the aggressors have been in the past and present.

In the West, the only possible way for Germany to win this attack on the Soviet Union is to imagine that Britain and the Soviet Union will not be able to cooperate to the end, or that cooperation cannot be achieved to the end. Therefore, after the formal announcement of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, Hitler has already failed by half; whether the remaining half will succeed or fail depends on whether Britain and the Soviet Union can cooperate to the end or whether new problems will arise. However, judging from the various clear and far-reaching expressions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union recently, the cooperation to defeat the aggressive forces is already very certain. In general, all peace offensives by Germany and Italy, whether against Britain, the United States, or the Soviet Union, will face complete failure now and in the future. Now, in order to guarantee and strengthen their alliance, the most important thing for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is to rapidly reach a consensus on a concrete plan for the post-war world reconstruction issue, so as not to affect the future progress of cooperation. Therefore, the Soviet Union's recent restoration of relations with the occupied countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia is undoubtedly accepting the views of Britain, and the world is very concerned and admires it. In the East, the parallel measures between Britain and the United States have already constituted one of the major pillars for stabilizing the Far East in the past, let alone the further cooperation now! China, this powerful force, has been able to support itself independently in the past. With the cooperation and assistance of multiple international forces in the future, it should be more vigorous in giving the aggressors a fatal blow. As for the Soviet Far Eastern Red Army, it has long been determined to fight independently, and in the completed situation of the anti-aggression front in the Far East, it is needless to say that it will make even greater efforts to resist aggression. In today's situation, regardless of whether Japan advances south, advances north, or makes a desperate gamble against China, the result is no less than fighting against five countries: China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies.

After the cooperation of all anti-aggression nations is determined, with common resources, common determination, and preparation, the final fate of the aggressor group is probably doomed, and there is absolutely no reason or way to win. From a military strategic point of view, the biggest goal of Germany and Italy's current aggressive actions is probably to capture Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev, and even pursue the Red Army all the way to the east to distant places. Whether it can achieve its goals and what the Red Army's counter-offensive strategy will be is not discussed now; from the perspective of terrain alone, the further its military organization advances eastward, the further it will be from its base, and its attacking power will be weakened, and the crisis of its rear being attacked by Britain and the United States will be aggravated. Even if it can capture Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev, Britain and the United States will inevitably launch large-scale offensives on other fronts to cooperate with the Soviet Union's resistance and counter-offensive. At that time, Germany and Italy seem to only have to return to Western Europe to engage in a large-scale war, which will give the Soviet Union an opportunity for a counter-offensive; otherwise, its rear will inevitably fall into chaos due to the offensives of Britain and the United States. That is to say, in any case, Germany and Italy absolutely cannot defeat Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union one by one today. It must prepare for a larger, common war against Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; and in such a large-scale battle, Germany and Italy actually have absolutely no future. Of course, they are waiting for and urging their Eastern ally, Japan, to respond quickly. If Japan takes action, its meaning will naturally be nothing more than two aspects: one is to carry out its own expansion policy, and the other is to respond to Germany and Italy. However, judging from the current military situation in the East, if Japan adopts a southward strategy, except for French Indochina, which may be forced to submit again, whatever territories and interests it attacks from Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, there is always the possibility of triggering a Pacific War. Assuming it adopts a northward strategy, then the situation of the Soviet Union under the dual attack from the east and west will of course be quite serious. With the relationship of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, it is of course impossible to expect Britain and the United States not to take major actions in the Pacific. And China's highest authorities have long made it clear that regardless of whether Japan advances south or north, China is prepared to launch a large-scale counter-offensive immediately. Britain's recent appointment of Duff Cooper to reside in the Far East to carry out all preparations and liaison also indicates that the possibility of defeating the Far East forces one by one is gradually disappearing.

The fate of the aggressors is always tied to the hands of others, while the fate of the anti-aggression nations is in their own hands; this is the fundamental difference between the two.

The British government is willing to reiterate its past promises, such as continuing to do its best to assist China, etc. After reading it, the Chinese government is deeply gratified to learn of this definite statement and guarantee from Your Excellency's government, which will further increase the Chinese government's determination to resist aggression and promote the friendship between our two countries. I am replying accordingly for your information. (22nd dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Concentrated in North China, No Less Than 100,000 People; Intention Not Yet Clear; Seemingly Will Invade Central Hebei Province

Chongqing - Reliable sources said today that the Japanese army has concentrated a large number of troops in the Pingjin area and central Hebei Province. Some estimates estimate that there are 150,000 Japanese troops concentrated in the area, most of whom are drawn from the surrounding garrisons in Shanxi and North China, and the Longhai Railway area. Sources here have clarified that these Japanese troops are being prepared for further advancement to the north, or are being transferred to other places. At the same time, the Japanese army has begun a suppression war against the strong guerrilla bases in central Hebei Province, especially in the area surrounded by eastern Hebei, the Great Wall, and the Pingjin-Shanghai Railway. Chinese observers speculate that the Japanese side's move is to take advantage of the concentration of Japanese troops in North China to suppress the area, as the Japanese army may want to use the roads in the area for transportation, and use the forward base to pass through Shankouergan and Outer Mongolia.

### Zhuang Ding from Putian Sends Letter Describing Enlistment Experience

Yong'an, Lin Yimei from Putian, Fujian, at the age of forty-four, an overage Zhuang Ding, led ten farmers in 1938 to voluntarily join the army, vowing to serve the country, initiating the trend of voluntary group enlistment in the county. In November of that year, they departed from Fujian. Nearly three years have passed since, and there has been no news. Recently, his younger siblings suddenly received a letter from him from Hunan, describing his enlistment and combat experience, and he encouraged the people of Fujian Province to rise up and fight together. The letter was filled with lofty ambitions. The original letter roughly stated, "Dear siblings, after leaving our hometown, we arrived in Hunan and supplemented the machine gun company of a certain division. After three months of training, we went to the front line in Jiangxi and faced the Japanese guns for two years. At that time, my spirit was with that of a senior scholar (Note: Martyr Lin Yi, during the Xinhai Revolution, followed Governor Lan Tianwei on an expedition to the Northeast. In the campaign to overthrow Yuan Shikai in 1915, he returned to Fujian to plan military affairs. He was arrested when the matter was exposed and was executed in Fuzhou on January 1, 1916. Therefore, I was able to remain safe amidst the hail of bullets. Later, I was hospitalized in the rear for six months. By the time I recovered, the troops had already moved to the Gao'an front line. I liked to be active, so I applied to return to my original unit, but it did not work out. So I joined the replenishment regiment nearby and was assigned to the transportation company of a certain division in western Hunan. I often think that I am an over forty-year-old who voluntarily joined the army. If I don't die for the country, I should bleed for the country. Heaven now seems determined to tease me, teaching me to sweat. Before, on the front line, I didn't know when this life would end, so I didn't send a single word home until now. Now I hear that Fuzhou has fallen, and the coastal people are extremely brave. If they can intensify training and demonstrate the spirit of fearlessness, then Fujian Province, with its many mountains, is most suitable for roundabout guerrilla warfare. If the Japanese army retreats in the future, and I can return to see my elderly parents, siblings, nephews, and nieces, wouldn't that be a great fortune? I hope you can tell me about the recent situation at home. Please send my regards to my parents and wish the whole family well." (20th dispatch).

### National-Communist Affairs Will Not Lead to Conflict, Division Will Affect the Future of Victory, The Central Government Does Not Want to Resolve the Communist Army with Force

Chongqing, Responsible Chinese and foreign sources here believe today that the recent highly publicized conflict between the Communist army and the Central army is unlikely to lead to a serious war. They pointed out that even based on the most recent conflicts, they are not as serious as the many that have been overcome in the past.

### US Loans Four Hundred Twenty-Five Million Gold to the UK, UK Uses Stocks and Bonds as Collateral for Repayment of Purchased War Equipment

Reuters, London, 22nd: According to news received here today, an agreement for the United States to loan 425,000,000 yuan to the United Kingdom, stipulating an interest rate of 3%, was signed yesterday. This loan was facilitated by the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation with the approval of President Roosevelt. Its purpose is to provide foreign exchange to the UK to pay for military supplies purchased before the enactment of the Lend-Lease Act. It is reported that the British side has agreed to use stocks representing its direct investments and certain bonds traded on the market as additional collateral for the loan. The organization and management of these direct investments (including all British insurance companies in the US) will remain unchanged. The loan term is limited to fifteen years. If two-thirds of the principal has been repaid by the end of the fifteen years, the UK may extend the term for another five years if it wishes. According to the Federal Loan Office in Washington, the interest and dividends generated by the collateral, plus the income designated by forty-one British insurance companies in the US to be allocated to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, will be sufficient to repay the entire loan by the end of the loan term. The above-mentioned additional collateral is estimated to be worth 500 million yuan and is divided into three categories: 1) stocks of sixty-one American companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, worth 305,000,000 yuan; 2) stocks of forty-six American companies not listed on the exchange, worth 115,000,000 yuan; and 3) the capital of British insurance companies in the US, valued at 180,000,000 yuan. This loan is provided to the UK in US dollar foreign exchange so that it will not be forced to sell its securities and investments.

Reuters, London, 22nd: Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Kingsley Wood announced in the House of Commons this afternoon the details of the US loan of 425,000,000 yuan to the UK to pay for military supplies purchased before the enactment of the Lend-Lease Act. It is said that this loan has been approved by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation with the authorization of the US President, and the agreement was signed yesterday. The purpose of this loan is to provide foreign exchange to the UK to pay for military supplies purchased before the enactment of the Lend-Lease Act. The UK will use stocks representing direct investments and securities traded on the market as additional collateral for this loan. The organization and management of these direct investments (including British insurance companies in the US) will remain unchanged. The annual interest rate for this loan is 3%, and the term is fifteen years. If two-thirds of the principal has been repaid at the end of the term, the term may be extended for five years at the discretion of the UK. The terms of the agreement were announced today. I believe the House will find these terms satisfactory and that they reflect the US government's willingness to do its utmost to assist us. The implementation of this agreement will require legislation, so the government intends to ask the House to pass all necessary laws as urgent matters. The details of this bill will be finalized tomorrow. The Prime Minister has instructed me to state that he would like the House to consider this matter and pass the bill completely during the fourth session next week.

### Germany Will Launch Another Peace Offensive, Using an Anti-Communist "Crusade" as a Guise, The War Against the Soviet Union is Deeply Mired

Reuters, London, 22nd: A dispatch from Istanbul states that the German invasion of the Soviet Union now seems to be slowing down again, which is the second time in two weeks. At the same time, there are more visible signs in Istanbul that German diplomats and propaganda experts are preparing to launch a major peace offensive in the short term. Germans in Istanbul not only admit that the Eastern European war has fallen behind schedule but also acknowledge that the unexpected setback of the German war machine on the Soviet front line is a cause for concern. Observers who recently traveled from Berlin to Istanbul said that the German side has widely announced in the occupied areas and neutral countries of Europe that the use of troops against the Soviet Union is an anti-communist "crusade." German spokesmen have also stated that if the British continue to fight, they will be rewarded with the "reddening" of Europe. The real war is now in the East, and Berlin is always prepared to offer reasonable peace terms. According to reliable sources from Germany, this peace movement is only a countermeasure taken by Berlin after feeling exhaustion and danger in the war against the Soviet Union. The first step of the German side is to try to convince neutral countries that their liberation depends entirely on the anti-communist war, and the second step is probably to try to make the British believe this as well. Although the Turkish people show signs of welcoming reconciliation, their attitude towards this matter is even more ambiguous. Two days ago, Turkey officially assured Britain that it would not use Turkish transportation to advance eastward. According to yesterday's news, the German side has suggested to Turkey to build a new type of highway across Turkey to Syria to repay Turkey for supplying various products.

### Americans Respond to the "V" Movement, Victory Will Belong to Democratic Countries, Imitation Will Not Fool Anyone

Reuters, New York, 22nd: The "V" movement initiated by British Prime Minister Churchill, the father of the movie star James Stewart, erected a ten-foot-tall "V" shape on top of a building, hanging high in the street, three hundred feet above the ground, and illuminating it with electric lights every night. The newspapers are still carrying extensive coverage of this movement. The New York Sun stated that the Nazis have now decided to use the "V" as a symbol of their victory. This kind of imitation is of course intended to disrupt, but no one will be fooled. Those who see the "V" shape on the walls in the occupied areas of Europe will know to whom the victory it represents will belong in the future.

Havas News Agency, Argentina's Capital, 22nd: Last night, "V" slogans were posted all over the streets here, indicating that democratic countries will surely win. At the same time, German ships anchored in the harbor also posted "V" slogans to show that Germany's construction of a new European order will surely succeed.

International News Agency, New York, 22nd: Many streets and some theaters in Prague have been renamed "Victoria" by the Germans to counter Britain's "V for Victory" propaganda campaign. This news was reported by the Columbia Broadcasting Company's Berlin correspondent.

### The Philippines Closely Monitors Japanese Actions

Reuters, Manila, 22nd: The shock caused here last week by the possible developments in the Far East has greatly eased, but hidden unease remains. People here are calmly watching various developments, such as the evacuation of Japanese residents from South Africa and the wartime inspection of telegrams sent to that place by the Tokyo authorities today. Well-informed sources believe that Japan is currently continuing to engage in international nerve warfare while also making preparations for any eventuality, such as taking advantage of the situation and attacking north when the Soviet Union needs reserves on the European front and withdraws troops stationed in Siberia. Others believe that Japan's main desire is to advance south, but in any case, military action is not very urgent because 1) the Japanese fleet is unlikely to take action in the seas off southern China during the height of the hurricane season; 2) Japanese ships are widely dispersed, and it will take at least six weeks for the migrants evacuated from South Africa to return to their country; 3) the new cabinet may not be fully ready; and 4) before the outcome of the Soviet-German war has a more concrete manifestation, Japan will be reckless whether it attacks north or south. At the same time, the declaration made recently in Singapore by Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Far East, regarding the attitude to be taken in the event of possible disturbances in the current situation in the Far East, has been fully endorsed by the American and Philippine people as part of the ABCD line and has been warmly welcomed by all parties.

### Tokyo Hit by Gales and Torrential Rain, Trees Uprooted, Traffic Disrupted, 12,000 Houses Flooded

United Press, Tokyo, 22nd: Countless houses have been flooded. The Meteorological Agency warned tonight that after ten days of incessant torrential rain, Tokyo will experience the greatest rain in history on Wednesday. There was also a hurricane hitting Tokyo tonight. In the past forty-eight hours, ships have been warned to take shelter. Tokyo has now been flooded, and the situation is expected to worsen tomorrow morning because the hurricane has passed through Tokyo and caused damage. Many roofs have been blown off, and many trees and telegraph poles have been uprooted. Traffic has also been disrupted. In fact, trains have stopped running because the roadbed is unstable and landslides have occurred. The latest estimate for Tokyo is that 12,000 homes have been flooded. The rainfall in the past ninety-six hours totaled twelve inches. Grains and vegetables have suffered significant damage. Although rice has not yet been damaged, it will also suffer losses if the heavy rain does not stop because the rice fields will be flooded and the growing rice will be washed away. Japanese newspapers tonight are expressing panic, predicting that the continuous heavy rain and storms will have important consequences. The Tokyo tunnel was temporarily closed this afternoon because it was flooded. The water in the lake sixty miles northeast of Tokyo has overflowed its normal waterline by four feet.

### Two Hundred German Planes Raid in Moonlight, Moscow Suffers Its First Air Raid, Soviet Fighters and Anti-Aircraft Fire Repulse Them, Fierce Fighting Still in Progress on the Central Front

Reuters, London, 22nd - Moscow Radio announced that over two hundred German planes attempted to invade Moscow last night but failed, with only a few managing to reach the city and drop bombs, causing several fires and some casualties. Military targets were not hit. Soviet fighters and anti-aircraft guns shot down seventeen enemy planes. This was the first air raid on Soviet territory since the start of the Soviet-German war. The alarm lasted for five and a half hours before being lifted.

TASS, Moscow, 22nd - At ten o'clock on the 21st, two hundred German planes attempted to attack Moscow but were unsuccessful. Soviet planes prevented most of the German aircraft from reaching the Soviet capital, with only a few enemy planes breaking through. Several houses in the city caught fire, with minimal casualties. There was no damage to military targets. Seventeen German planes were shot down. In addition, German planes attempted to bomb Leningrad twice in the past two days but were both times prevented by Soviet planes from reaching the city. Nineteen German planes were shot down, while the Soviet side lost four.

United Press, Moscow, 22nd - Since Germany began its attack on the Soviet Union over a month ago, the Soviet capital was attacked by German planes for the first time last night. However, due to the density of Soviet anti-aircraft fire and the patrolling of the skies by Soviet night fighters, the German attack was not very strong. Officials announced that seventeen German planes were shot down. Several German bombers took advantage of the cloudy, moonless sky to avoid Soviet night fighters, sneaking into Moscow at ten o'clock in the evening. On the 20th and 21st, German planes twice attempted to bomb Leningrad but were driven back by Soviet fighters, failing to reach their targets. According to the Information Bureau, eleven German planes were shot down during the first attempt to reach Leningrad, and eight were shot down during the second attempt. The Soviet side also lost four planes in the engagements. The German tactics were no different from those used against Britain, first dropping flares over Moscow, followed by several heavy explosive bombs, and finally countless incendiary bombs. However, the fires caused by the German incendiary bombs were quickly extinguished by well-trained Soviet firefighters, special air defense personnel, and volunteers, resulting in very little significant damage. Several buildings in the central area caught fire, and several civilians were killed. Soviet anti-aircraft batteries unleashed a fierce barrage of fire, and Soviet fighters also flew into the sky to intercept the enemy. The German air raid alert lasted for five and a half hours, during which Soviet anti-aircraft guns and night fighters were very active. The Information Bureau communiqué stated that the German attack had failed, as only a few of the two hundred German planes that attempted to attack Moscow were able to reach their targets. Soviet night fighters continuously intercepted German planes, so only isolated German planes were able to break through the defenses.

Haitong News Agency, German Headquarters, 22nd - This afternoon's German military report stated that Moscow was attacked for the first time last night, with clear visibility under a bright moon. German planes bombed military facilities, ammunition depots, and transportation centers in several waves. The residences of Soviet military commanders and administrative organs were destroyed or severely damaged.

TASS, Moscow, 22nd - On the 22nd, in the areas of Bykhov, Polotsk, Nevel, Smolensk, Novograd-Volynsky, and Vyazma, extremely fierce fighting continued. Soviet planes bombed German tanks, and thirty-two German planes were shot down. The Soviet side also lost eight planes.

Reuters, London, 22nd - According to Moscow sources, the German side's two air raids on Leningrad were ineffective, with nineteen German planes shot down and four Soviet planes missing. Also, a Moscow-based American newspaper correspondent reported that Smolensk, an important railway center between Minsk and Moscow, is still in Soviet hands. London sources believe this is quite possible, although German forces appear to have made some progress on both sides of the city or have crossed the city in some areas. It is reported that Soviet forces are currently holding the northern sector between Pskov and Leningrad very successfully. On the Ukrainian front, there is no reason to believe that German forces have reached Kiev.

Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 21st - Today marks the thirtieth day since the start of the German-Soviet war. Although German forces are advancing step by step, they have not achieved a decisive victory. The main objectives of the German forces are three: (1) to encircle Leningrad and annihilate the Red Army resisting there; (2) to occupy Kiev; and (3) to encircle the Red Army between Smolensk and Moscow. According to German sources, the German forces are advancing on both the north and south sides of the Moscow highway, one aiming for Rzhev (northwest) on the upper Volga River towards Moscow, and the other aiming for Roslavl (southwest) towards Moscow and the Desna River. The German and Soviet armies are engaged in bloody battles between Smolensk and the aforementioned objectives. The German strategy is to quickly encircle Soviet forces, while Leningrad and Kiev are in imminent danger. In general, the Red Army is fighting bravely.

The Soviet Union Prepares for a Protracted War, Moscow is Not Afraid of Air Raids

Reuters, Moscow, 21st - Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Lozovsky announced last night that although the German side claimed that the Soviet land and air forces had been annihilated, the dates set by the German side for the capture of Kiev, Leningrad, and Moscow have long passed, and German forces have not yet occupied these three cities. The real reason can be found in the orders issued by Major General Nehring, commander of the 18th German Panzer Division, which were discovered in a captured Soviet tank. They stated, "The loss of our weapons and aircraft is obviously extremely significant. Although we have made progress, the losses far outweigh the captured spoils of war. If this situation continues, it will be unimaginable, because we will ultimately defeat ourselves by winning in this way." Lozovsky continued, "The German 'blitzkrieg' against the Soviet Union will have lasted a month by Tuesday morning, and this war will continue for many months. At the next reception, we can discuss the results of the first month of the war." Lozovsky also mentioned the discord between the Nazis and their so-called allies, saying that Germany, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia hate and distrust each other, each with their own ambitions, and that there is internal strife, while the democratic countries are different, working together in unison, with no intention of seizing each other's territory. Lozovsky then described Hitler's so-called "European Front" as ridiculous, saying that the German side had not specified the number of pro-German volunteers, except for the report that thirty-eight Scandinavians had arrived in Finland to join the "Anti-Bolshevik Crusade." The anti-communist movement in France and Spain has lost momentum. Although a few people in Spain are chanting anti-communism, the number of French volunteers has not been specified, and is estimated to be no more than five or ten. When asked whether Moscow would follow the example of London and maintain normal traffic during air raid alerts, Lozovsky replied that Moscow would follow the current practice of clearing people from the streets to maintain high discipline during alerts and minimize casualties. However, factories will continue to operate until an emergency alert is issued. Moscow will issue an alert if enemy aircraft are spotted flying towards the Soviet capital from the front lines. The nearest German planes have come to Moscow is still over a hundred miles away. Recent alerts issued in the Soviet capital were merely tests. When asked whether the Soviet government was satisfied with the German policy of scorched earth, which it described as malicious, Lozovsky expressed satisfaction, saying that it was closely linked to the activities of guerrillas behind enemy lines. There are still hundreds of villages and towns behind enemy lines that are not in enemy hands, because hundreds of guerrilla groups are still cutting off enemy supplies of food and gasoline and attacking small units of German troops behind enemy lines. This is an unusual double war, with well-armed Soviet soldiers appearing in towns and forests behind enemy lines. The German vanguard is constantly suffering from the threat of supply lines being cut off, and its advance is being hindered.

Northern Red Army Uses Scorched Earth Tactics, Forest Area Ablaze

Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 22nd - After Finnish forces occupied the city of Liepāja on July 8th, the only thing found intact in the city was a bandstand in a square. The entire city had been burned to rubble by Soviet forces. According to a correspondent for the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, when Finnish forces entered the city, they were completely enveloped in an atmosphere of terror.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd - Last night, it was learned from military authorities that the German-Finnish allied forces on the northern front of the Eastern Theater had made significant progress in extremely difficult circumstances. Soviet forces set fire to forests along the border in an attempt to hinder the Allied offensive, but the German-Finnish forces disregarded the flames and advanced through the smoky, fiery forests, tracking their enemy. There were no roads in the area for vehicles to pass, so soldiers had to carry all their equipment, including ammunition, food, and other special equipment. However, the German-Finnish forces overcame all these difficulties, occupied large swathes of enemy territory, and broke through the Soviet defenses along the old Soviet-Finnish border.

Ukrainians Share a Common Hatred, Elite German Troops Litter the Landscape with Corpses

TASS, Moscow, 22nd - Ukrainian writer Mykola wrote in Pravda, "Hitler's elite infantry has found its final resting place in Ukraine. Enemy corpses litter the landscape, too many to count. The Ukrainian people are gathering their strength behind enemy lines, bravely and swiftly attacking the enemy, blowing up their trucks, burning their airfields, and destroying their soldiers. The enemy is madly killing defenseless women, children, and the elderly, but we have not been intimidated by this. These acts of violence have infuriated our freedom-loving people, who vow not to coexist with the enemy. Germany attempted to conquer Ukraine three times in the 13th century, 1914, and 1918, and all failed. This time, we will defeat the enemy again, so that they will never rise again. Ukraine will never submit to German fascism. German fascists will meet their end in Ukraine."

TASS, Moscow, 22nd - Stavsky wrote in Pravda, "In the vast fields of the Belorussian Soviet Republic, flames burst forth, men, women, and children wail to the heavens, corpses pile up by the roadside, and villages are completely destroyed. I once asked a captured German pilot, 'Why do you bomb trains full of women and children? You are flying at an altitude of four or five hundred feet, can you not see that those on board are all women and children?' The pilot replied, 'These women and children placed themselves in the impact zone, and they have only themselves to blame.' Refugees fleeing from behind enemy lines said that the enemy's cruel and terrifying methods are outrageous. In an order issued by Sergeant Major 4755 of a German tank unit, he expressed his willingness to extend the German so-called new order by massacring the Soviet people. He said in the order, 'All those who are integrated with the Soviet system should be shot.' In another order, German generals forbade shooting chickens, dogs, cattle, and sheep and destroying or looting property. This is indeed an admission that the German army is cruel, murderous, and specializes in looting property."

Germany Forces Italy and Romania to Send More Troops, Both are Feeling a Lack of Manpower and Resources

Reuters, London, 22nd - A Free French News Agency correspondent stationed on the French border reported that Hitler has asked Italy and Romania to send more troops for use against the Soviet Union. Italy and Romania have asked Hitler to explain his objectives on that front. Hitler replied that his objectives were strictly limited, and that he would stop advancing as soon as the objectives were achieved. In any case, the German army will meet outside the Volga River. The number of troops needed by the German side to hold the occupied territories in the Soviet Union is far more than Berlin expected, so it is asking Italy to supply about ten divisions of strong expeditionary troops, and Romania to supply more manpower and resources, offering Romania the territory of Odessa in the Soviet Union as bait. However, Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu has refused this proposal, as Antonescu is already satisfied with regaining Bessarabia.

### Stalin Personally Takes Command of Military Power, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sends a Congratulatory Telegram, Expressing Deep Friendship Between China and the Soviet Union

Havas, Chongqing, 21st - After Soviet People's Commissar Chairman Stalin concurrently assumed the position of People's Commissar of Defense and took overall command of military power, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of China, sent a telegram of congratulations, expressing his deep friendship with the Soviet Union in very earnest terms.

United Press, Moscow, 22nd - Deputy Foreign Commissar Lozovsky announced that War Commissar Stalin has now formally assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army, saying, "Stalin is not only a great politician, but also an excellent strategist."

TASS, Moscow, 22nd - Regarding Stalin's appointment as Soviet People's Commissar of Defense, the Soviet working masses from all walks of life are enthusiastically commenting. Foremen at the Hammer and Sickle Factory in Moscow declared at a rally, "The eyes of our working masses, the people of the whole country, and the whole world are focused on our Bolshevik Party, our leader, and our friend Stalin. We understand that the security of our motherland is now placed in Stalin's hands. Our determination and strength to defeat fascism are growing stronger every moment." This is indeed the voice of all the Soviet people. Workers in factories, mines, and oil fields across the country have passed resolutions expressing their readiness to do everything possible to help the Red Army win victory.

TASS, Moscow, 22nd - Pravda, under the headline "Defeat the Enemy Under Stalin's Guidance," published an editorial stating, "The Soviet people, who are heroically fighting German fascism, warmly support the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR to appoint Stalin as the People's Commissar of Defense of the USSR. Stalin's name is a symbol of the greatest victory of the working masses and the unity of the Soviet people. The fact that the Soviet working masses were able to win victories in the revolutionary movement and against foreign aggressors in the past is due to Stalin. Stalin's appointment as Soviet People's Commissar of Defense, directly commanding the Red Army, represents a further step in the unity of our people and a further step in our loyalty to the Bolsheviks and the Soviet government. Stalin said that victory does not come automatically, it requires the spirit of overcoming difficulties, not fearing sacrifice, and never giving up. These admonitions have been engraved in the hearts of the Soviet people. The news of Stalin's appointment as Soviet People's Commissar of Defense has given the Soviet people infinite encouragement. The entire people are determined to work hard and make sacrifices in order to defeat the enemy. The Red Army and the Red Navy vow to redouble their efforts to fight the enemy, thwart their conspiracies, blunt their edge, and fight to the death for the motherland and win victory."

### Litvinov to Visit London, to Seek Strengthened Anglo-Soviet Cooperation

Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 22nd - A dispatch from London received on Monday stated that former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov will soon visit Britain on a special diplomatic mission.

### Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Restore Diplomatic Relations, Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia Sign Mutual Assistance Agreement, Soviet People Unanimously Support

TASS, Moscow, 22nd - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky told reporters, "The arrival of Yugoslav Ambassador to the Soviet Union Gavrilović in Moscow proves that the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have fully restored diplomatic relations."

TASS, Moscow, 22nd - The Soviet working masses, collective farmers, and cultural figures unanimously support the Soviet-Czechoslovak mutual assistance agreement against Germany. Workers at the Bolshevik Machine Building Plant in Kiev said, "Stalin said that our motherland's war for freedom and the war for the independence of the people of Europe and America will inevitably merge into one. The above agreement proves that his words are correct, and our strength will inevitably increase."

### Severe Damage to Romanian Oilfields

TASS, New York, 22nd - The New York Times correspondent in Istanbul reported that 200,000 tons of various oil products were burned in Ploiești as a result of Soviet air raids in a week. Countless oil refineries, oil well distillation equipment, and oil tankers were destroyed. The damage to Ploiești's various facilities amounted to 2 million dollars. Ploiești was attacked by the Soviet Air Force on the night of the 15th, and the fire lasted for eighteen hours. According to a representative of the British Embassy in Ankara who is familiar with the situation in Ploiești's oil industry, it will take six months to restore these losses. However, given the lack of raw materials to restore the losses, Ploiești's oil production capacity will inevitably decrease.

### British Planes Heavily Attack German Industrial Areas, Frankfurt and Mönchengladbach are the Focus of Bombing

Reuters, London, 22nd - British planes attacked western Germany on Sunday, focusing on the Frankfurt and Mönchengladbach areas. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, the industrial areas and transportation lines in both areas were heavily bombed. In addition, small squadrons of British planes bombed the shipyards of Cherbourg and Ostend. One British plane is missing.

Several bombs fell in East Anglia, destroying several houses and causing several casualties. A small number of bombs also fell in other areas, causing minimal damage and no casualties.

### People in Southeastern Europe are Anti-German, Conflicts are Frequent

British and Belgian forces are concentrating their efforts to wait for the day when they can help the entire Allied forces to liberate the country.

### The Problem of Housing in the Wartime Capital Has Been Adequately Safeguarded

(Chongqing Airmail) "Oh, for a mansion of thousands of rooms, To shelter all the poor scholars of the world and make them rejoice!" Scholars, impoverished scholars, bearing an air of pride, found it difficult to reside in Shanghai. Arriving in Chongqing, they still found it difficult, but even more so. The housing problem caused not only impoverished scholars to feel the pain of circling a tree three times without finding a branch to perch on, but even middle-class families felt powerless and unable to solve this serious problem. In Shanghai, I suffered from the exploitation of second landlords, with rent increases today and demands for the premises for personal use tomorrow. Arriving in Chongqing, I encountered the same heavy pressure of frequent rent increases. Crows are black all over the world, and no one is willing to fall behind in profiting from the national crisis. Especially when there is an opportunity to make money, who would consider giving it up?

Letters from relatives and friends in Shanghai indicate that the housing problem there remains difficult and rents are still increasing. However, in Chongqing, there has finally been some glimmer of hope recently. The authorities, recognizing the instability of the housing problem and the urgent need for correction, have promulgated sixteen articles of the "Provisional Regulations on Housing Rental During Extraordinary Times." This has provided a solution to housing disputes that is relevant to the current situation. Originally, this could be considered a "local matter," with no need for Shanghai readers to know. However, because I have personally experienced the suffering of housing disputes in Shanghai, I will briefly explain these regulations, hoping that they can serve as a reference for the authorities in Shanghai, or that they can help residents in Shanghai who are suffering from housing problems to alleviate their worries.

The "Provisional Regulations on Housing Rental During Extraordinary Times" promulgated in Chongqing have been well received by residents. For houses built before 1937, the regulations stipulate that the rent shall not exceed 20% of the original rent in 1937. For houses built after 1938, the rent shall not be higher than 2% of the total value of the building and land per year. For leases signed before the promulgation of these regulations, if the rent exceeds the above standards, it may be paid according to the standards stipulated in these regulations, unless both parties agree otherwise. Rent shall be calculated on a monthly basis, with one month's rent prepaid upon leasing. Landlords shall not force the collection of more than one month's rent and shall not collect tips. If a tenant notifies the landlord of their intention to renew the lease one month before the expiration of the lease, they may continue to lease under the original terms, and the landlord shall not refuse.

The landlord shall not lease the house in whole or in part to a third party within one year. Landlords who violate these regulations shall be fined up to 1,000 yuan in accordance with the law.

These regulations have provided relief and a temporary respite for the people in Chongqing who are suffering from the pressures of life and forced eviction. I think of the residents of Shanghai, searching for housing in advertisements, struggling to find a place to shelter from the wind and rain. I believe that sooner or later, there will be appropriate measures to remedy the situation. At the very least, this dispatch of mine contains some hope for resolving the housing problem in Shanghai.

Article 8: If the lease has a fixed term, unless the landlord takes back the house for personal use upon the expiration of the term as stipulated in Article 11, the landlord shall not refuse if the tenant notifies one month before the expiration of the lease that they wish to continue the lease under the original terms.

Article 9: If the landlord refuses to accept the rent paid monthly by the tenant in accordance with the lease, the tenant may deposit the rent in accordance with the law.

Article 12: If the landlord's house is destroyed by bombing to the point that it cannot be used, the landlord shall return all of the security deposit to the tenant.

Article 13: If part of the landlord's house is destroyed by bombing, if the tenant wishes to continue to lease the remaining part, they may pay the rent in proportion to the original rent.

### Finance: Cash Prices Surge More Sharply, Reaching Over 7,100 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold market started with off-market trading. Although the Yiyuan and Litai firms in the western part of Shanghai continued to release over 15,000 taels, the market pressure slightly suppressed the price. Later, the market suddenly turned bullish, and most people's sentiment turned upward. As there was no significant easing of foreign exchange, short sellers' minds were shaken. Therefore, the price was forced down from 6,545 yuan to a low of 6,510 yuan in the afternoon. However, in the last hour, rumors spread that Germany had released a message of peace to England, and unfavorable rumors also arose in the city, with talk of a compromise between the U.S. and Japan. Short covering emerged, disregarding everything. Huipiao merchants like Dafeng made huge purchases, and Xinfeng Yong and securities firms competed to buy, leading to a sharp rise in price, soaring to 6,565 yuan. In the end, the price rebounded and rose by 14 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 120,000 to 130,000 taels. The swap (July rolling into August) sellers offered to pay the buyers 35 yuan in the morning and 40 yuan in the afternoon. Cash prices rose even more sharply. Xianghe advanced 20 taels of Zhongxing, priced at 7,100 yuan. Shihe advanced 80 taels of Tianyuan, priced at 7,120 yuan. Hesheng then advanced 20 taels, priced at 7,130 yuan. Later, Xianghe re-released 50 taels of Zhongxing, priced at 7,110 yuan. In the afternoon, 7,120 yuan was not traded, a rise of 90 yuan. Gold ornaments were priced up by 10 yuan, totaling 735 yuan.

Futures Up 14 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 6,540 yuan at 9:15, 4 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. Then, it was 6,545 yuan. Yiyuan, Chengda, Tongkang Yong, and Xinfeng Yongchengji successively sold heavily, gradually pushing the price down by 20 yuan to 6,525 yuan, which was absorbed by Litai and securities firms, pushing it up to 6,537 yuan. Upon hearing that the U.S. dollar was quoted at 5.34375 yuan, Yiyuan, Xinfeng Yong, Renchengyong, and securities firms all sold heavily, falling by 21 yuan to 6,516 yuan. Renchengyong, Chida, and Chengji bought in at noon, pushing it up to 6,527 yuan. The noon closing price was 6,526 yuan. In the afternoon, the market opened at 6,515 yuan. Xinyuan and retail investors sold, retreating from 6,520 yuan to 6,510 yuan. Suddenly, there was news that the U.S. dollar was still difficult to settle at 5.34375 yuan, and foreign wires reported that Germany had released a message of peace to England, and there were rumors of a compromise between the U.S. and Japan. Sentiment was greatly boosted. Dafeng, Yida, Xinfeng Yong, and Xiangxing Yong successively bought heavily. Short covering emerged, and the price soared by 55 yuan to 6,565 yuan, which was re-released by Yiyuan, Xinfeng Yong, and Xiangxing Yong, causing a decline, retreating to 6,545 yuan. The closing price at 3:30 was 6,550 yuan, a rise of 14 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Based on the August U.S. dollar settlement price of 5.3125, it was still 6,555 yuan, a discount of 5 yuan. The closing price was 6,548 yuan, with a price difference of 55 yuan for the day. The gold price for gold shops was 580 yuan higher than the futures price, and 80 yuan lower to buy in than to sell out. There was no price or market for spot gold.

Ornamental Gold Prices Rise by 10 Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silverware shops, Datonghang and Xintonghang, successively increased by 10 yuan in the morning, totaling 735 yuan, with a reduction of 40 yuan for buying in, it was said.

### Foreign Exchange Black Market: Narrow Fluctuations

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listed rate. The black market fluctuations for British and U.S. exchange rates were even smaller, showing a tight trend. After the morning opening, Japanese banks again offered spot U.S. dollars, but the amount was very small. Chinese merchants and speculators also had small amounts of supply and demand, which were insufficient to affect the market. Foreign banks also operated in both directions, causing the spot U.S. dollar to ease to 5.34375 yuan, and then it was available for sale again. In the afternoon, news came from Hong Kong, and speculators re-entered, so the market quickly returned to level after easing. The closing price was the same as the previous day, and trading became scarce.

Japanese Merchants Did Not Offer Much

From the morning, foreign wires reported that the British and Indian silver markets were long, and U.S. banks did not change. The exchange rate of various countries against Shanghai was down by nine cents against the U.S. dollar, and the rest was flat. The central listing rate for various exchanges did not change. The early morning selling price of the bank was 3 pence, 23.4375 for spot British exchange, and 5.3125 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Later, Japanese banks suddenly offered a little more spot U.S. dollars at 5.34375 yuan, which was absorbed by foreign banks, and the market remained flat. The HSBC listing rate did not change. The silver balance tax rose by half a cent, totaling 24.25%. The HSBC small counter U.S. exchange rate was long by 0.0625, totaling 5.3125 yuan. Later, speculators bought and sold in varying amounts, and banks supplied and demanded in both directions, making the market even more stable. Chinese merchants bought July at 5.3125 yuan and sold August at 5.34375 yuan. The trading volume was scarce at noon. In the afternoon, the exchange rate was the same as the morning opening price.

Hong Kong Still Had Settlement Inflows

In the afternoon, the U.S. dollar at 5.34375 yuan was once again strong enough to settle, but soon news came that Hong Kong had inflows, and the price of gold rose. Therefore, in the midst of the bullish rumors, speculators re-entered July and August U.S. dollars at 5.3125 yuan, and the market returned to level. Shortly before the 3:30 closing, the spot to August British gold was 3 pence, 23.4375, and the U.S. dollar was 5.3125 yuan, both the same as the previous day's closing price.

Hong Kong British and U.S. Rates Unchanged

Hong Kong, 22nd (Tuesday) Dispatch: This morning's exchange market opened flat. The Shanghai exchange rate alone fell by one yuan to 463 yuan, with no other changes.

Tianjin Exchange Market Lengthens

Tianjin, 22nd (Tuesday) Dispatch: This morning's exchange market opened flat. London and New York telegraphic transfers eased by 0.03125 each. London was 3 pence, 71875, and New York was 6.49375 yuan. The black market for Shanghai exchange and "joint notes" still opened at the original rate, with no change.

### British and U.S. Gold Pounds Soar Sharply with Cash

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw futures and spot prices rise sharply. British and U.S. gold pounds also rose sharply by two yuan. British gold notes remained fixed as before, and the market price was stable. U.S. gold notes opened at 1,878 yuan. After opening, Zhengda, Tongyi, Baoxiang, etc. sold, retreating to 72 yuan. Then, suddenly, Yingtai, Shuntai, Yong, etc. bought, and the noon closing price rose to 74 yuan. In the afternoon, the market opened at 73 yuan. After opening, Xiecheng sold, retreating to 71 yuan. Zhenhe, Bada, Lianhe, Xietaiyong, etc. competed to buy, pushing it up to 83 yuan. Shuntai Yong and retail investors sold, retreating to 1,880 yuan at the closing, a rebound of two yuan compared to the previous day. The spot price was 18.5 yuan. Hong Kong notes showed a weak trend, and the market price softened. Japanese gold notes rose slightly by 0.005, and the evening market rose to 2.045 yuan. Korean notes showed a stable trend, and the evening market remained at the original rate of 1.66 yuan.

### Securities: Type C Breaks Through, Old Longs Exit, Foreign Stocks Very Active

The black market for public bonds was very volatile yesterday due to the exit of old longs, which was extremely busy. Those who fueled the flames were particularly enthusiastic. Groundless rumors arose in the market, which is a common practice in the market, especially when interest is about to be paid. And often after the market price has fallen, there are inevitable fabricated words to confuse people. Those who absorbed at low prices in the market made up for their short positions, and there were also quite a few new bulls. It may be another new transfer. Type C bonds suddenly broke through the 70 yuan mark, and people's hearts were extremely weak for a time. The afternoon was relatively stable, which was entirely due to the uneven balance between longs and shorts. The trend will not change again before the interest is collected, and the temporary market may improve slightly. The opening in the morning yesterday was stable. Lianhe, Jiufeng, Yichang, Xiexingyuan, etc. bought in large numbers. Xinfu sold out very enthusiastically, and Xie Kang fueled the flames. Hongda and Xinhua also sold large amounts. Before long, the 70 yuan mark was broken. The decline in Type B bonds was even more severe, and the noon closing price was a small fraction of 1 to 1.5 yuan. In the afternoon, Lianhe, Tongxing, Runde, Lianyi, Dingkang, and Huainan successively bought in. Huainan and Lianhe were mostly buying, while Xinfu still had settlements. Xinhua and Hongda continued to sell, and Jiucheng Shengdatongshun also sold. The market price was weak and recovered, slightly stronger than in the morning. As a result, it continued to fall by 0.4 to 1 yuan for the sixth day. The transaction volume was about 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 30 shares of Kangyuan Canning Factory were traded at a price of 18.75 yuan.

The opening of the Zhongye stock market was quite strong. After a period of activity, it turned quiet. Xiangtai and Yeguang shares were traded a lot. The former's highest price was 78 yuan, and the latter's 20.5 yuan was also opened. In the afternoon, industrial stocks did not fluctuate much. Rubber stocks were very active, and all stocks rose a lot and almost all rose directly to the highest closing price.

London, 21st (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remain calm. Only the stock of McGallie Bank alone rose by 1 shilling and 3 pence, priced at 9 pounds, with no other changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Long and Short Contend, Yarn Prices Rise

The yarn market tended to rise after fluctuating, but most people's sentiment was bearish, and sellers were particularly active. The reason for this was said to be sluggish real demand. However, a major firm, Mouji, had a strong bullish sentiment. Every day, when prices fell, it gradually bought in, intending to absorb. Because overseas cotton markets were soaring every day, the factory's costs increased, which showed the fierce contention between the long and short sides. However, from a fundamental point of view, the yarn market was more expensive for raw materials, and the foundation should be consolidated. However, transactions were not prosperous, which prevented its rise in strength. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,602 yuan, and the low price was 1,588 yuan. The initial transaction price in the afternoon was 1,602 yuan, rising to 1,607 yuan. Some profit-takers sold out, returning to 1,599 yuan, but the Shanghai West gang came to push it in again. At the same time, the spot gold was good, and it rose to 1,613 yuan. The final price was 1,609 yuan. The current situation is still in the brewing stage. There may be a major change soon. Today, 1,355 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma opened in the morning, and people's sentiment still tended to sell, and was not bullish. The initial price was 1,596 yuan, rising slightly to 1,598 yuan. Those who shouted wildly in the circle, seeing that the market price could not break through the 600 yuan mark, unanimously shouted to sell, and the situation turned downward again to 1,590 yuan. However, upon seeing a small wind, those who rushed to cover shorts came to grab in again, and it rose to 1,595 yuan. This situation happened no less than four or five times in succession. It was heard that the gold price had declined, and sales did not rise, pressing it down again, and it fell to 1,588 yuan. However, Moufeng still pushed in, and the price turned bullish again. When it was past 12 o'clock, the trading floor suddenly tightened, rising to a closing price of 1,602 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics totaled 7,300 bales. The amounts bought by various gangs are listed as follows:

Hong Kong 1,100 Mainland 100 Peers 7,000 Statistics 7,300

The morning initial opening of the Jin Shuangma futures yarn market was due to the continued rise in foreign cotton prices, and the Mided Lin cotton in the U.S. rose by 0.17 points again. There were quite a few new purchases and short covering in the near month, up 5 yuan compared to yesterday. September was up 0.5 yuan. Sellers in October saw an increase, and suddenly fell by 4 yuan. Afterwards, because foreign exchange and gold prices were not very special, and the actual demand from customer gangs was still not improving, major firms remained on the sidelines, and buying and selling decreased. The market trend was entirely hovering. The recent period was slightly weak, and the far month was slightly firm. At noon, the 8th and 9th months each rose by 1 yuan, and October fell by 1 yuan. The transaction volume was 3,310 bales. Because the gold price rose sharply in the afternoon, the market price was flat first and then rose. August futures once rose to 1,463 yuan, September futures to 1,527 yuan, and October futures to 1,539 yuan. The evening closing price rebounded slightly. As a result, August futures rose by 9.5 yuan compared to the previous day, September futures rose by 6.5 yuan, and October futures rose by 6 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 8,110 bales, a decrease of 1,750 bales compared to the previous day. The full-day opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded on the left (all are net trading prices).

### Cotton Prices Difficult to Stabilize, U.S. and India Soar Step by Step, Boosting Confidence

The current cotton situation continues to be good, because the U.S. and Indian cotton markets are soaring, resulting in rising converted prices, so confidence is greatly boosted. However, recently, arrivals have been crowded, and the market may be flattened one step further.

Another news report stated that the spot transactions of foreign cotton by foreign firms in Shanghai continued to be firm due to the soaring prices of U.S. and Indian cotton. However, due to the poor condition of cotton yarn, and the large amount of U.S. and Indian cotton arriving in Shanghai, the buying intention of various parties was slightly weakened. Yesterday, only foreign factories were more active and there were some fixed orders for Brazilian cotton. Flower firms were not very enthusiastic.

The New York cotton market is becoming increasingly firm due to active buying intentions, and at the same time, the cotton cloth trade is in good condition, and the weather reports are unfavorable to short sellers, so it has made rapid progress. The closing price yesterday was 34.5 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to the settlement of long positions and the rather tense situation in the distant frozen zone. Subsequently, it rose sharply due to the rise of retail investors to cover shorts and speculative purchases. As a result, the closing prices rose by 6 to 11 rupees each. It is also predicted that the market will open higher by 2.75 rupees today.

Also, the statistics of Indian cotton from September 1 of last year to July 19 of this year are recorded on the left (400 pounds per bale).

### Piece Goods: Increased Sales in Both North and South

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market turned bullish because factory boards continued to hold firm. Most people were not pessimistic, and hoarding households gradually became active. Customer gangs and wholesale distributors of this street's dyeing factories also increased their purchasing appetite, so the cloth boards tightened up later in the market. White coarse and fine cloth and twill rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 0.5 yuan. This factory traded nearly 1,000 pieces of various cloths. The Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang gangs traded more than 500 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse cloth, and twill. The North Road Tianjin Yantai gangs traded 100 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel. On the 23rd, 1,410 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.

East Cloth: Because the Tianjin gangs and wholesale distributors on this street continued to search for goods, the market board rose steadily. The marked cloth for each month of the exchange rose by 0.3 to 0.65 yuan per piece. In the spot market, Longtou Fine Cloth Factory's singles rose by 0.45 yuan, with a closing price of 49.7 yuan. The Sijunzi Serge was also raised by 0.01375 to 1.6225 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Red and Green Tea Sales Move Slightly in the U.S.

Yesterday's foreign firm tea market saw slight movement in sales to the U.S. There were telegrams inquiring about purchasing domestic red tea and shrimp eye green tea. The whole city's Yihua, Jinlong, Huacha and other firms bought in a total of 780 boxes. Red tea sold for 360 to 380 yuan, and pearl tea sold for 295 to 310 yuan, with little change from before. In addition, the Nanyang gang again purchased more than 200 dan of tea cores and tea pieces yesterday, selling for 130 to 150 yuan, and the market was quite stable.

### Food: Rice Prices Decline Frequently, Still Too High

Yesterday's foreign rice market experienced another decline, especially for Xiaojiao. The reason for this was that foreign rice stocks were ample, and arrivals continued without end. The Public Works Bureau's Hong Kong rice Xiaojiao already had a large inventory waiting to be sold, and even those that had been approved for sale were still difficult for firms to completely distribute. Yesterday, some were sold back on the market, lowering the price to 104.5 yuan per picul, more than 10 yuan lower than the official selling price, so there was an expectation that the official selling price would soon return to the original price of 110 yuan. The quoted price for Xiaowen on the market was only 116 yuan per picul, and then it fell by 0.05 and 0.1 yuan, remaining soft at 113-114 yuan. Yinghua's Xiaojiao spot price was 145.5 to 145 yuan. The futures morning still had 146.2 yuan and 145.8 yuan, and then opened at 145 yuan, 144 yuan, and then fell to a low of 143 yuan. No. 2 Siamese July immediately fell sharply to 135.5 yuan, a sharp drop of 4-5 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading customers and hoarders were hesitant to move forward, and the street's purchasing appetite was insufficient. The spot rice transaction was only 6,000 bags, and Yinghua's was only more than 600 tons, it was said. In addition, because of the former dock workers' strike, which lasted for half a month, all the goods that had already been traded and were waiting to be shipped were stopped at the same time, and the goods that were completed later were also about to expire, so starting work and shipping goods were combined in one day, and the required capital was heavy, and it was suddenly felt difficult to turn around. In this environment, those who held goods had to quickly release their goods in order to be flexible. The thoughts of floating hoarders and retail investors were all dull, and they were only seen selling out one after another. At the closing, No. 1 Saigon was sold for only 120.05 yuan, 120 yuan, and then 118 yuan. No. 2 Siamese was 112 yuan, 110 yuan. Min Dang high-quality goods were 126 yuan, 125 yuan. Zhongguan was 118-119 yuan, Xiaojiao was 115 yuan to 113.5 yuan, broken pointed rice was 88-89 yuan, and then 86 yuan, a huge drop of 3-4 yuan compared to the previous market.

Although there were few thick and thin japonica rice stored, the market price fell as foreign rice depreciated again and again, inevitably being constrained, and the sales in the native village stores were also slack, making it difficult to support the market, and the selling price was reduced by more than 1 yuan. Kainan port fresh early and late rice were high from 139 yuan to 136 yuan, and Wuxi original bag white japonica was 132.5 yuan, 132 yuan.

Glutinous rice was ordered to fall, and it was unusually deserted, becoming dull and unresponsive. The various prices quoted were still not much different from the previous market.

The Public Works Bureau's low-priced foreign rice arrived at the port one after another. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou round shipped 10,000 bags of foreign rice for the Public Works Bureau from Hong Kong, and arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading (Zu).

### Flour Market's Downward Trend Returns: Foreign Flour Sources Uninterrupted

The downward trend in flour prices has resurfaced, with sluggish sales to customers. Although new foreign orders have not been placed, the supply continues unabated. Domestic new wheat prices are reported to be low, and nearby goods are gradually being shipped in, causing market fluctuations. Jinlong Flour opened at $31.55, but after hearing of the sharp decline in rice prices, it immediately dropped to $31.45 and $31.40. The closing price was only $31.25. Pao Tai Flour was at $32.35, and Hua Niao Flour at $32.30. Overweight Zhonglou Flour was at $32.60, a decrease of $0.30 to $0.50 compared to the previous price. The total daily trading volume was about 5,000 to 6,000 bags. The market remains sluggish.

Recently, wheat prices have been low, and merchants have been transporting small quantities of wheat, which are mostly delivered to Japanese factories nearby for use. The selling price remains around $41 per 100 catties. Currently, due to the sluggish rice flour market, Japanese factories are strictly adhering to the weight standards for wheat.

More foreign flour has arrived in Shanghai. The Tai Koo company's Yuezhou vessel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, bringing 10,000 bags of foreign rice for the Public Works Department from Hong Kong, as well as 5,000 bags of flour. The goods are currently being unloaded.

### Oil Cakes: Cooking Oil Continues to Rise

Cooking Oil: Yesterday, the market saw mixed price movements. The price of raw soybean oil rose due to shortages, jumping up by $2.00 to $3.00. Cottonseed oil, however, experienced a slight decrease of around $0.50 due to ample supply from factories and profit-takers selling off their holdings. A total of 50 barrels of raw Qingdao oil, 30 barrels of soybean oil, 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, over 4,000 dan of Qing oil from the Dayou factory, and 500 dan of Qing oil from the Dade New Factory were sold (prices detailed in the market price column).

Soybean Cake: Yesterday, sales were primarily to rural buyers, with limited activity from inland and customer buyers. The market was therefore sluggish and lacked momentum. Futures trading was characterized by intense competition between bulls and bears, generally rising initially before weakening, ultimately seeing a slight squeeze upwards. A total of 1,000 pieces of Dayou soybean cake were sold at $14.90, 1,000 pieces of Changji soybean cake at $13.80, two cartloads of Fei Zi cake at $14.00 to $12.50, and 2,000 pieces of Shenji soybean cake at $15.30 to $14.60. In addition, 20,000 futures contracts were traded at prices ranging from $16.75 to $16.55.

### Coal: Hongji No. 2 Slack

Large Quantities Arrive

Despite the recent unrest in Vietnam, large orders for Hongji white coal slack continue to arrive unabated. Yesterday, a certain company received another 5,700 tons of coal slack and lump coal, causing a situation of oversupply at the docks. Although competitors are cutting prices, industry insiders claim that costs have not decreased and are maintaining the original prices. No. 2 slack is still priced at $330, and is sold separately at $17.50 per dan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Stable

Yesterday, the sugar market was calm as the Sugar Industry Company had not yet officially opened, leaving speculators uncertain about future trends. Both crude and refined sugar prices were stable, with the guild quoting prices for old shipments of No. 24 crude white sugar arriving on May 14th at $94.87 to $94.70, shipments arriving on June 12th at $95.35 to $95.80, and new shipments arriving on July 3rd being sold immediately at $96.20, shipments arriving on July 13th being sold at $96.40, and end-of-month shipments being sold at $96.60 to $96.50. Tai Koo refined sugar was priced at $117 for the "B" mark and $168 for the "DY" mark bagged. Zu Shi brand was priced at $104, and HX mark (stating good delivery) was sold at $94. TCC mark Dutch red sugar arriving on the 16th of last month was priced at $75 to $75.20. Another 500 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### North-South Goods: New Xuzhou Melon Seeds

Xuzhou correspondence: This year's first batch of melon seeds have already appeared in small quantities, but the production price is high, with the cost for station delivery close to $230. Shanghai's old Xu Kui seeds are priced at $165, a difference of $60 to $70. Although these are new goods, the price difference is too large, so for the time being, no one dares to do business.

Madame Chiang Kai-shek Presents China Relief Certificates

The Benevolent Society organized by the Writers' Department of the United China Relief Fund is formed by philanthropists who support China. Regardless of whether they are Chinese or Westerners, those who donate more than $100 to the fund will not only receive membership in the society but will also be given a China Relief Certificate personally signed by Madame Chiang Kai-shek as an encouragement. The China Relief Certificates issued by Madame Chiang Kai-shek were sent to the United States a few days ago. In recent months, Westerners have continued to donate generously, with excellent results. It is now estimated that there are 750 members of the Benevolent Society who have obtained membership due to donations of more than $100. These members will now receive China Relief Certificates and member badges issued by Madame Chiang Kai-shek.

Chinese Writers Send Letters of Thanks for Assistance

On the 7th of this month, Chinese literary writers Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Xu Dishan, Ba Jin, Jing Song, Xia Yan, Hu Feng, and others jointly wrote to famous European and American cultural figures such as George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, Romain Rolland, Albert Einstein, and Thomas Mann. They began by saying that China had been fighting for four years, stopping Fascist aggression in the Far East. During this period, they had received assistance and encouragement from advanced figures in Europe and America, and they expressed their gratitude on behalf of the Chinese people. They went on to say that Germany and its Fascist allies disregarded good faith and attacked the Soviet Union. The world's Fascist forces had formed a united front, and the democratic freedom of human society was in imminent danger. Therefore, they especially appealed to people around the world to unite and use their pens and tongues to awaken peace-loving, freedom-loving, and just people, and to work together to extinguish the flames of evil.

### Reportedly, Authorities to Levy Special Business Tax to Compensate for Financial Deficit, Scheduled for Formal Discussion Today; English and American Merchants Said to Express Strong Dissent

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession established a Tax Reform Committee to seek ways to compensate for the financial deficit and studied ways to increase revenue with all parties. After the committee decided that in order to increase income, a tobacco and other special business tax should be levied. It is reported that this matter will be submitted for discussion at the Public Works Department meeting to be held on the 23rd. The newspaper also claimed that this tax system violates the Yang Jingbang Land Regulations. If passed, it will be separated from the old system tax system stipulated by the Land Regulations, giving considerable blow to British, American, and other third-country capitalists. Therefore, British and American people strongly oppose this measure. Therefore, it is attracting a lot of attention whether this new tax system can be passed.

In addition, interns Ying Shanrong and Fei Dingnian from the Zhenda Customs Brokerage raised money from their colleagues and personally delivered it. Their enthusiasm is commendable.

### Shanghai Banks Continue to Pay Due Debts As Usual; Rumors of Payments Being Changed to Hong Kong Proven False

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the National Debt Fund Management Committee has agreed with the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Agricultural to discount and pay for the Republic of China 25th Year Unified Public Bond, Republic of China 25th Year Reconstruction Public Bond, and Republic of China 17th Year Financial Long-Term Public Bond, which are guaranteed by customs revenue. The A, B, C, D, and E bonds of the Unified Public Bond will be paid from the 31st of this month, the Reconstruction Public Bond will be paid from August 31st, and the Financial Long-Term Public Bond will be paid from September 30th. The paying institutions are the Central Bank and the Bank of China and Bank of Communications entrusted by it. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has approved the request of the head office. It is reported that the head office has ordered the Shanghai branch to handle the payment matters as usual. The external rumors that the payment has been changed to Hong Kong are inaccurate. After receiving the order, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has prepared all the payment procedures. All bondholders can apply to the bank for payment at that time. After the confirmation that Shanghai will pay as usual, the bondholders are very excited and deeply admire the government's maintenance of creditworthiness.

### U.S. Issues New Immigration Regulations Under State of Emergency; Anyone Wishing to Enter the U.S. for Any Reason Must First Obtain Approval from a Special Committee

The United States government has recently announced new immigration visa regulations. The following is a copy of the notice from the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong: "According to instructions from the U.S. government, from July 1, 1941, any person who is not a U.S. citizen and wishes to enter the United States must first obtain approval from a special committee in Washington, D.C., before a U.S. consul can issue a visa. These new procedures apply to anyone who wishes to enter the United States for any reason, including students, travelers, foreign spouses of U.S. citizens, businessmen and their spouses, etc. Anyone wishing to obtain an import visa must submit one copy of a completed and signed identity form and two copies of an affidavit signed guaranteeing the applicant's identity and financial support to the committee in Washington for review. These forms can be obtained from the U.S. Consulate General or the U.S. State Department in Washington. Applicants who wish to avoid wasting time can have their guarantor obtain these forms directly from the U.S. State Department. Applicants who are not applying for an immigration visa must also submit one copy of the identity form and two copies of the guarantee affidavit. However, if the applicant has no relatives or friends residing in the United States, they can find someone with good reputation overseas and with ties to the United States to handle the formalities. If the matter is urgent, the affidavit and identity form can be sent to Washington by telegram, with the applicant bearing the cost of the telegram. The promulgation of the above procedures is due to the national emergency and the need to ensure national defense. The new procedures will inevitably cause considerable delays and inconvenience, but their purpose is not to completely deny entry to legitimate applicants."

### Flat-Priced Rice Automatically Sold at Discount; Market Price Lower than Ceiling Price; Price per Stone Quoted at $114; South City and Pudong Also Allowed to Purchase and Sell

Since the authorities of the two concessions have actively taken measures to stabilize the food supply in this city, it has achieved significant results. Rice prices have gradually fallen, and rice stocks have increased, so there is no risk of shortage in the future. Major hoarders are in great panic. The sales of spot goods are sluggish, and the rice market fluctuates.

Rice Shops' Initiative Praised

Yesterday, it was learned from the Public Works Department of the Public Concession that the situation has been very good since the bureau directly purchased special small-grain rice from Rangoon from the Hong Kong government. However, due to cost factors, the selling price per stone increased from $110 to $116. Currently, all rice shops are selling the flat-priced rice at a discount because the selling price of non-flat-priced rice has plummeted. The price per stone (160 market catties) is quoted at $114. Yesterday, some of the signs displayed by the rice shops still showed $116, but some had already changed to $114 per stone. This is the rice shops' initiative, which is also praised by the authorities.

South City and Pudong Allowed to Sell

Yesterday, according to well-informed sources, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has now allowed rice merchants in the South City, Zhabei, Pudong, and other places to purchase bulk foreign rice from the bureau and sell it to residents in those areas. However, after applying, it must be approved by the authorities before it can be purchased in bulk. The method is the same as in the concession, with the price of $116 per stone (net weight 160 market catties) being sold to citizens. Yesterday, several rice shops on Dongchang Road in Pudong obtained sales rights. When the Public Works Department began to handle foreign rice, rice merchants in the South City and other places repeatedly requested the authorities to allow them to purchase it in bulk, but the authorities did not approve it due to environmental constraints. Now, because the Hong Kong government is determined to fully assist the food supply in this city, the purchase of rice in the South City and other places has also been approved. Therefore, residents in those areas can now obtain the right to purchase foreign rice from the Public Works Department.

The name of the Japanese merchant and the selling price are unknown. The Ewo Tai Building was built by the Ewo Tai Steamship Company in 1921 by a British construction company. The company closed in 1936, and the new owner entrusted an agent to manage the building, preparing to sell it at a good price. Now that a Japanese merchant is willing to purchase it, the owner has entrusted Jardine Matheson to handle the sale procedures.

### Gunfight Between Bandits and Japanese Troops in Yangshupu the Night Before; American Soldier Detained Due to Verbal Misunderstanding; Bridges Briefly Closed Again Yesterday Morning

The previous morning, the Japanese army discovered a suspicious person near 111 Nan Er Zhi Li, North Sichuan Road, and declared a temporary curfew at 9:20 a.m., sealing off the bridges along the Suzhou Creek and cutting off traffic for a major search. The curfew was lifted at 2:00 p.m., and the situation was very tense for a while. Afterwards, some said that a Japanese soldier was sniped, and some said that five people were arrested. There were many rumors, and the truth was not known until yesterday. No Japanese soldiers were sniped, and no one was arrested on North Sichuan Road. The person captured on Mao Hai Road in Yangshupu was confirmed to be another case. It was also learned that after the curfew was imposed the day before yesterday afternoon, an American soldier was detained by the Japanese side due to a verbal misunderstanding when passing Fielun Road, and was soon released. From 11:20 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. yesterday morning, Hongkou District was sealed off again. It is reported that an important Japanese officer was passing through the area, and there was no other reason. The details are recorded below.

Tense Situation, No Gains

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, at around 9:10 a.m. the day before yesterday (21st), three bandits attempted to break into 111 Nan Ren Zhi Li, near North Sichuan Road. Several Chinese and Japanese pedestrians saw them, and the bandits drew their guns and fired, fleeing south towards North Sichuan Road. At that time, the Japanese military police in the concession heard the sound and rushed to the scene. They threw a hand grenade, and the Japanese marines believed they were terrorists and immediately sealed off the three bridges across the Suzhou Creek at the same time. At that time, the Hongkou area south of Lao Bazi Road was in a very tense situation. Although the Japanese side made great efforts to search, they had not gained anything by 2:00 p.m.

U.S. Soldier Detained While Passing Through

According to the North China Daily News, an unexpected incident occurred at the Fielun Road Bridge when the curfew was lifted the day before yesterday. It is said that at 2:00 p.m., the Fielun Road Bridge had resumed traffic, and there were many pedestrians passing through the area. At that time, an American fourth Marine Corps soldier was riding a bicycle from [missing word] and arrived at the bridge, intending to cross the bridge. However, he was stopped by two Japanese soldiers. The American soldier got off the bicycle and tried to walk across the bridge with the bicycle, but he was unsuccessful. According to eyewitnesses, three or four Japanese soldiers pushed the American soldier into a guardhouse on the bridge and then took him to the Japanese naval headquarters. He was then released. It is said that there was a misunderstanding due to a verbal miscommunication between the two sides.

Six People Arrested in Yangshupu

The Japanese-language Continental News reported that the Japanese Marine Corps Yangshupu Detachment received a report at around 9:40 p.m. on the 21st that several bandits were discovered near Mao Hai Road. They immediately went to arrest them and saw six suspicious people near the intersection of Kunming Road. They went forward to question them, but one of them drew his gun and fired at the Japanese army. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle. Five bandits were arrested on the spot, and another was wounded in the left wrist and fled towards Huishan Road. After hearing the news, Japanese resident Saeki Michitoshi, who lived at 22, Lane 943, Dong Youheng Road, and others pursued and captured him.

### Bomb Discovered at Bao Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop

At 7:30 p.m. last night, a hand grenade was placed near the counter of the Bao Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop at 16 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. A customer discovered it and reported it to the shop assistant, who immediately reported it to the police station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate, and the bomb was taken to the police station. An investigation into the source of the bomb is underway. It is reported that the shop received a threatening letter a few days ago.

### Japanese Side and Police Arrest Chinese

At 6:30 p.m. yesterday afternoon, Japanese personnel in a military vehicle with license plate number 381 went to the Lujiawan police station in the French Concession and requested the dispatch of detectives to go to a certain place to arrest Chinese people.

### Fire at Paint Factory, Three Injured

A fire broke out suddenly at the Yutai Paint Factory at 12 Columbia Road in Shanghai West at around 10:00 p.m. last night. The fire brigade drove to the scene and tried its best to put out the fire, which was eventually extinguished. As a result, a part of the factory was destroyed. When the fire was raging, three people, Lin Miaosheng (34 years old), Shen Xinda (27 years old), and Liu Shun (39 years old), were burned by the fire. All three were taken to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road by ambulance for treatment. It is said that the three were seriously injured and are in critical condition.

### The Da Shijie Amusement Park Opened Last Night

The Da Shijie Amusement Park at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Montauban in the French Concession suddenly had tourists distributing propaganda materials the day before yesterday afternoon. Afterwards, the police officers entered to search, and that evening at 6:00 PM, they ordered a temporary suspension of business to avoid trouble. At the same time, police officers were dispatched to be stationed inside. Yesterday afternoon, the amusement park remained closed because it had not received orders from the police. It was not until 6:00 PM in the evening that the French Police Department notified it to resume business, and the tourists were like clouds.

### Machinery and Iron are Effectively Prohibited from Export, but Customs Has Not Announced It. The Machinery of the "Hai Te Ma Le" Ship Was Destined for India

The British merchant vessel "Hai Te Ma Le" of Butterfield & Swire intended to leave Shanghai southward a few days ago. Suddenly, Japanese naval gendarmes blocked the ship from exiting the port to investigate the destination of certain machinery it was carrying. As of today (the 22nd), the ship is still tethered to buoys 13 and 14 in the Huangpu River and unable to depart. The Japanese authorities in this city suspect that the aforementioned machinery was being transported to Chongqing.

Machinery of "Ma Le" is Destined for India

However, according to information obtained by reporters, the machinery was actually destined for Calcutta and a certain port in that area. An employee of Butterfield & Swire stated that there was no development in this matter, so it is unknown when the "Hai Te Ma Le" can exit the port. Supposedly, the ship obtained the necessary documents from customs to transport machinery and other goods south, and the loading was completed and they were about to set sail when the Japanese side suddenly made things difficult. The detention of the British ship carrying machinery is the second time this has happened in a week. The previous time was the Taikoo Company's "Guangdong" ship, which was detained for several days and only released a few days ago.

Negotiations are Expected to Resolve Smoothly

Furthermore, according to the "North China Daily News," the Japanese authorities investigated the machinery carried on the "Hai Te Ma Le" yesterday (the 21st), causing the ship's departure to be delayed. Yesterday afternoon, the British side began negotiations with the Japanese naval authorities, hoping to allow the ship to leave the port as soon as possible. Well-informed sources do not believe the rumor that the ship or part of its cargo has been detained, because the "Hai Te Ma Le" is currently docked in the Huangpu River, waiting for the order to weigh anchor, and none of the machinery on board has been removed. It is noted that recently, many merchants in Shanghai have had difficulty exporting machinery and ironware. The Jianghai Customs has not issued a notice beforehand that these goods cannot be exported, but applicants for permits to export machinery, etc., are constantly waiting for a long time and have not received these permits.

### Gangster Tang Haigen Was Injured by an Ax; Lin A'gong Also Injured

Tang Haigen, a local man formerly a "hug-tai-jiao" (doorman/porter) at the Six Nations Hotel, thirty years old, residing at No. 3, Lane 106, Rue Massenet in the French Concession, was having tea at the Ming Yuan Tea House at No. 126 on that road with his friend Lin A'gong (32 years old) from Ningbo at 11:15 AM yesterday when suddenly six or seven men rushed up the stairs, all armed with sharp knives, axes, iron rods, iron rulers, and other weapons. Without asking questions, they used axes to chop at Tang and Lin. Tang was immediately hit with seven or eight axe blows, and his chest and back were all cut, bathing him in blood. He collapsed on the ground in pain. Lin was hit in the back and other places with three or four axe blows and also injured and fell to the ground, groaning in a pool of blood. The attacking men, seeing this situation, dispersed and fled downstairs without a trace. Afterwards, the French police, upon receiving the news, dispatched a large group of personnel to the scene and summoned vehicles to send the injured to the hospital for medical treatment. It is said that Tang's injuries are very serious and his life is in critical condition. It is reported that the case originated because both sides were gangsters, and they had previously held "chi-jiang-cha" (negotiations) over a certain matter, but the negotiations failed, so they carried out the murder. It is also reported that the police have captured one gangster involved in the incident and are investigating.

### German Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council Had His Car Robbed

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," the private car of Mr. Ge Letai, the German director of the Shanghai Municipal Council (registration number 1585), was robbed in front of a certain restaurant at the intersection of Di Feng Road and Avenue Haig last night (the 21st) at 11:30 PM. The Shanghai Western Special Police are currently investigating this case. At the time, Ge Letai was dining in the restaurant, and the car was parked outside. Suddenly, three bandits broke into the car. Two bandits held weapons and forced the driver to drive to Route Tenant near Rue Cardinal Mercier, where they kicked the driver out and then drove westward.

### Large Number of Robbers Sentenced

Fan Defu, Chief Inspector of the Central Police Station, and detectives Wang Jinsheng, Huang Hairu, Zhu Wanjun, and others previously apprehended a large number of robbers, including Chen Futian and more than ten others, at flat houses on East Tokyo Road and Zhabei in West Shanghai. They were found to have committed more than ten cases, including the kidnapping of Huang Xuanping, General Manager of the Northern Lights Company, and Yu Jingqi for ransom, as well as the robbery of Jin Cheng Theater owner Liu Zhonghao's family property and the robbery of a large amount of jewelry from Yu Gongqi on Jiaotong Road.

### The First Hospital of the Refugee Association Adds Special Wards

### Fire is Humanity's Benefactor and Also Humanity's Great Enemy: The Deeds of Firefighters, Saving Lives and Property Amidst the Flames

Fire is humanity's benefactor, but once it gets out of control, it becomes humanity's great enemy. Countless lives and property are turned to ashes in the flames. Therefore, mankind racks its brains to find ways to prevent or extinguish it. Firefighting tools have been improved with the times, up to the present day. In major cities around the world, whenever the God of Fire rages, the fire engines speeding through the streets, although not perfect, can be considered the most effective firefighting tools that human intelligence can achieve today.

Countless firefighters sacrifice their lives or become permanently disabled in order to save people's lives and property. They disregard their own safety, climb high-rise buildings to rescue children trapped in fiery pits, or bravely break into houses with gas leaks to plug them, or use axes to break through walls to prevent millions of dollars of property from being destroyed in a single fire. However, how many people in the world have written about these heroic deeds?

In short, in major cities like Shanghai, there are these unsung heroes serving the public, who are vigilant all day long, without a moment's懈怠, to prevent this great enemy of mankind from harming the citizens. However, firefighters are always silent and unnoticed. The Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade, currently commanded by Captain H.G. Reed, has been on guard since 1866, fulfilling its duties to the best of its ability, saving the lives and property of citizens throughout history.

Taking the first half of this year as an example, the Fire Brigade's loyalty to its duties has resulted in fewer losses of life and property in the Public Concession than in the same period last year and the year before. From January to June the year before last, a total of 59 people died in various accidents in the concession, 37 people died in the same period last year, and only 22 people died this year. The number of injured, 174, is slightly higher than last year's 143 and the year before last's 169.

In the first half of the year before last, the value of property lost to fire was 2,867,069 yuan. In the same period last year, it suddenly increased to 6,775,221 yuan. However, thanks to the Fire Brigade's prevention and rapid firefighting, it has decreased to 2,654,983 yuan in the same period this year.

Firefighters inevitably die in the battle against the flames. The year before last, 49 people died in the first half of the year, 63 people died in the same period last year, and this year, due to improvements in firefighting facilities and advances in technology, the number of firefighters burned and killed has been drastically reduced to only 24 people.

The amount of hose laid out by the fire brigade when responding to a fire was 257,160 feet in the first half of the year before last, 236,835 feet in the same period last year, and 151,265 feet in the same period this year.

Only water can extinguish the raging flames. The Fire Brigade used 2,869,721 gallons of water in the first six months of this year, 10,539,967 gallons in the same period last year, and 10,314,190 gallons in the same period the year before last. The firefighters' firefighting time was 543 hours in the first half of this year, 1,509 hours in the same period last year, and 1,053 hours in the same period the year before last.

In the first six months, the heaviest loss in the Public Concession's fires was at the cotton godown on Dalian Wan Road, where cotton and other goods worth 100,000 yuan were burned to ashes. Other fire losses included: an iron factory with 300,000 yuan, an office building with 100,000 yuan, a printing house with 80,000 yuan, a fire equipment factory with 75,000 yuan, a cardboard box factory with 70,000 yuan, a pharmacy with 65,000 yuan, a cotton godown with 60,000 yuan, thatched houses with 46,000 yuan, a raincoat factory with 45,000 yuan, and a silk fabric store with 37,000 yuan.

In terms of fire deaths, the most tragic event in the first half of this year was on May 19, when a streetcar caught fire at the intersection of Shanhai Guan Road and Rue du Cardinal Mercier, burning to death nine men and women and injuring sixteen people who were burned or injured while escaping in the confusion. The fire was caused by a passenger's celluloid button being burned by a lit match. Soon after, the culprit was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.

In terms of the number of injuries, the most serious was the bombing at the Central Bank on Route Foch, which injured 35 employees. Another person was rescued from the rubble by firefighters but had already died. Other major fires that resulted in deaths included: a fire at a women's clothing store on Tongfu Road on May 2, killing and injuring four people each, and a fire at a chemical factory, killing two people and injuring ten people.

Over the past six months, due to the Fire Brigade's effective firefighting measures and the cooperation of the Municipal Council's Public Works Department, celluloid factory fires have been greatly reduced, with only four occurring, compared to 20 in the same period last year and 12 in the same period the year before last. In the four celluloid factory fires this year, only one person was burned to death and eight were injured, compared to 23 deaths and 40 injuries in the same period last year and 3 deaths and 2 injuries in the same period the year before last.

In May of this year, three major fires on Rue Siccawei caused a total material loss of 230,000 yuan. This was due to the difficulty of utilizing firefighting facilities when fighting fires in the Extra-Settlement Roads area. Originally, the building materials there were flammable, and the flames spread quickly. Moreover, the location was remote, making it difficult for firefighters to carry water pipes and find a way to enter the area to fight the fire.

In the past six months, the Fire Brigade's ambulance was summoned a total of 3,419 times, an average of 570 times per month, or 19 times per day. The ambulance was specially and urgently summoned 33 times.

The most important auxiliary to the Fire Brigade is the Volunteer Reserve, whose members serve the public and receive no pay. There are currently 28 volunteer members. It is hoped that the number will gradually increase. Under the leadership of Mr. Wadhams, the Volunteer Reserve constantly practices and listens to explanations of fire prevention methods, and their performance continues to improve. The Reserve will hold its annual exercise and dinner on August 3.

The Public Concession Fire Brigade was originally a "volunteer" organization founded in 1866, serving the public diligently for about 53 years. It was not until 1919 that the Municipal Council allocated funds to establish the current Fire Brigade. The importance of the Volunteer Reserve can be seen from this. (Bai Min)

### Distributing New Seeds of Pyrethrum

The Chinese Chemical Industrial Society in this city has been pioneering the production of domestic pyrethrum. It has established a vast experimental field in West Shanghai for more than ten years, and has spared no effort in research, improvement, domestication, and promotion. It has recently been reported that the seeds produced by the society now flower more than ten days earlier due to years of domestication and elimination, and are more compatible with the soil and climate of various parts of the country, making production more reliable. This year's pure new seeds have been released. In order to give preferential treatment to growers, the price is still set at one yuan per market tael. The chrysanthemum seedlings issued are sufficient for half a mu of land. Pre-orders are very enthusiastic. Those who have not pre-ordered can also purchase them from the society and the gardening department of the China National Products Company on Nanjing Road.

### Methods of Historical Research (9)

— Xue Wu Jing

Who is shorter, who is longer—this is another form of comparison. The Jin Dynasty's Faxian wrote "A Record of Buddhist Kingdoms," the Tang Dynasty's Xuanzang wrote "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions," and Yijing wrote "A Record of Buddhist Practices Sent Home from the Southern Sea." These can be used by Europeans for comparative studies of India. Marco Polo wrote "The Travels of Marco Polo," and Rashid-al-Din Hamadani compiled the Yuan Dynasty history, which was translated and supplemented by Hong Jun as "Translations and Corroborations of the History of the Yuan Dynasty." These can be used to understand the major events and social conditions of the Yuan Dynasty. By comparing their strengths and weaknesses, evaluating their merits and demerits, distinguishing clearly between right and wrong, and establishing clear judgments, this is what is called the comparative method.

(5) Introduction to Specialized Books

Zhang Xuecheng's "General Principles of Literature and History" states, "All Six Classics are history." Jiang Quan's "Masters and Their Sayings" says, "The Masters are also history." The earliest historical works include the "Book of Documents" and the "Zuo Zhuan," almost all of which are historical materials. The earliest historian and author of systematic works is Sima Qian. Later, the "Book of Han," the "Book of the Later Han," and the "Records of the Three Kingdoms," whether written by individuals or compiled by government offices, were all new creations of their time. Extending this to include private notes, public archives, foreign works, and daily newspapers, anything that records human activity in the past and present is considered history. From this perspective, even if we had thousands of mansions, we could not store all historical texts. Moreover, time is limited, and human life is but a hundred years. With a forest of historical books written throughout the ages, where should one begin? This is where the introduction to specialized books becomes necessary. I believe that regardless of the quantity of historical materials, instead of starting with the Six Classics, the Masters, or the Twenty-Five Histories, it is better to begin with the works of recent scholars. Because later eras benefit from more recent scholarship, newly published books will be able to use logical methods, sociological principles, and the characteristics of European and American historical compilation to organize the old texts of five thousand years and systematize them. Thus, previously dead books become living materials of the present. This is the most economical method for us. If one has gained a basic understanding and wishes to deepen their knowledge further, or if one has set a goal and established guidelines, then one can consult the works of ancient scholars, adopting what is suitable and discarding what is not. In this way, one can become an authoritative writer. There are too many historical texts to introduce them all, which would be excessive and inevitably lead to omissions. However, if I do not mention any, scholars will feel lost and without direction. I will only briefly mention a few for beginners and those who specialize in history, to give a general overview.

1. For Beginners

(General) Wang Tongling's "A History of China," Zhang Shanqin's "Comprehensive History of China," Xia Huiyou's "Ancient History of China," Chen Gonglu's "History of China and Modern History," Xiao Yishan's "Comprehensive History of the Qing Dynasty," "Outline and Mirror Made Easy to Understand," "Records of the Grand Historian," "Book of Han," "Book of the Later Han," and "Records of the Three Kingdoms."

(Specialized) Liu Yimou's "Cultural History," Jiang Weiqiao's "History of Buddhism," Traditional Islamic History, Liang Qichao's "History of Pre-Qin Political Thought," Hu Shi's "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy," Wan Guoding's "History of Land Tax," Zuo Shunsheng's "Historical Materials on China's Recent Hundred Years," "A History of Imperialist Oppression of China," Gao Yanbo's "An Outline of China's Recent Hundred Years," Guo Moruo's "Research on Ancient Chinese Society," Xiao Yishan's "Collected Works on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and the first and second series of "A Series on Chinese Cultural History" (totaling forty works).

### Several Good Examples from the Student Aid Fund

— Xi Nan

There is more than one way to help students. Some scholars help with their knowledge, some wealthy people help with their wealth, some help individuals, and some help groups.

What does it mean for a scholar to help with their knowledge? Under the old Chinese education system, there were countless examples. Whenever a learned teacher saw a child with talent who was struggling to afford tuition, the teacher would willingly waive the tuition and teach the child, helping them to achieve academic success. The most prominent example is Teacher Zhou Tong in the Story of Yue Fei. Seeing that Yue Fei was destined for greatness, Zhou Tong willingly taught him, ultimately enabling Yue Fei to become a unique hero in Chinese history. Eight hundred years after Yue Fei's death, he is still praised by everyone, showing that loyalty and righteousness endure forever. This is not just a fictional tale. In the Biography of Yue Fei in the Book of Song, it is also said, "He studied archery under Zhou Tong, mastering his skills. He could shoot with both hands. After Tong's death, Yue Fei would offer sacrifices at Tong's home on the first and fifteenth of each month. His father (He) told him, 'If you are to be used by the times, you must die in battle for your country!'" Yue Fei's father was also a chivalrous and compassionate person who helped those in need, which is why he was able to raise such an intelligent, courageous, loyal, and unparalleled son. History says, "Yue He could save food to help the hungry, giving without expecting anything in return. He was generous and righteous, giving land to those who encroached upon his fields and not demanding repayment from those who borrowed money." If Yue He were alive today and a reader of the Shen Bao, he would surely be a most enthusiastic and generous contributor to the "Reader's Student Aid Fund." I believe that in Shanghai society, there are many people with thoughts like Yue Fei's father, who will surely give birth to sons like Yue Fei, who will shine through the ages and remain immortal. Although this is not entirely a matter of cause and effect, there is a natural connection between things, and planting melons yields melons, and planting beans yields beans.

What does it mean for a wealthy person to help with their wealth? The most prominent example is the Student Aid Fund of this newspaper. It is not called a loan because loans must be repaid, and while repayment can help a second person, it may also cause problems. It is also not called a scholarship, which rewards students for their diligence and progress, providing them with encouragement and financial assistance to become even more profound and knowledgeable. However, the Shen Bao specifically calls it the Student Aid Fund. Since it is called aid, there is no expectation of repayment. Nor is it a reward, so it is not limited to those with high academic achievements. In my opinion, the Student Aid Fund is funded by readers' donations, and the money should be used to help those who donate. When those who receive aid achieve academic success in the future, they will know that they owe their success to the help they received. This will make them more likely to sympathize with poor students and help them. If it were a loan, it would only be a relationship of debt, and the recipient would only need to repay the money. However, when people are helped by others, and the helpers possess a spirit of universal love and benevolence, it not only touches the hearts of those who receive help, making them unforgettable, but it also inspires the cowardly and encourages the corrupt, spreading a spirit of mutual assistance throughout society. In that case, the Student Aid Fund will not only achieve material success, but its spiritual success will far exceed its material success.

Student aid funds did not begin with today's Shen Bao, but they go by different names while being essentially the same. For example, Jian Zhaonan, the founder of the Nanyang Tobacco Company, repeatedly funded students to study in the United States. If you are interested in visiting the Jueyuan (also known as the Nanyuan of Jian Zhaonan) in the Buddhist Pure Land Society on Hede Road, you will see a monument erected by those who received Jian Zhaonan's funding to study abroad and have now become prominent figures in society and established their careers. When these people look back on the past, they will surely recognize the great significance of the Shen Bao's Student Aid Fund. Although it differs in scale from what they experienced, the spirit is exactly the same, and they should do their best to support the progress of this Student Aid Fund.

As for collective student aid, there are examples like Ye Chengzhong and Yang Sisheng, who both came from poor backgrounds and later established their own businesses. Although they were not scholars themselves, they ultimately achieved success. However, they knew that scholarship was important, so they willingly spent their own money to establish schools and cultivate talent. The Chengzhong Elementary School was founded during the Guangxu reign and even received a plaque inscribed by the emperor, which is the same kind of honor as receiving a commendation plaque today. Another example is Wu Xun, a beggar from Shandong, who used the money he saved from begging to run schools, which was even more difficult and even more admirable. It is clear that helping others to pursue education is a joyful thing in life. As Mencius said, "To educate the talented people of the world is one joy." To be able to help ambitious young people to fully utilize their knowledge and serve the world is, of course, also an extremely joyful thing.

An old woman named Xia saw that her poor students were determined to make progress in their studies, and her grandson's studies were also inspired and made great progress.

Seeing these situations, it is clear that there are many different ways to help people pursue education, and they ultimately lead to success. This shows the great significance of the Student Aid Fund. I deeply hope that the readers of the Shen Bao can help those who lack the ability to pursue education to gain the opportunity to study. How fortunate that would be!

I have no knowledge to help others, nor do I have wealth to help others, so I can only rely on a worn-out pen to write a few words. If the Shen Bao gives me a稿費, please ask the editor to use it for the Student Aid Fund, which can also be said to be the meaning of those who have the ability to help with their strength. However, my strength is too weak, and a little 稿費 is embarrassing to mention! (稿費 donated to the Student Aid Fund)

11. Midnight Song

"Who could be as clever as you?" The woman from the Meng family leaned forward, fixing her gaze on Mei Shi's face, and suddenly had an idea. "Sister, you are both clever and beautiful. Wouldn't it be a waste of talent to only read a few dead books?"

Mei Baozhen never expected her to utter such a literary phrase!

"Is studying a waste of talent?" Mei Bao asked, suppressing a smile.

"In your opinion, how would someone like me not be a waste of talent? Could it be like..."

She originally wanted to say, "Could it be like opening a grocery store like your family?" But she stopped herself, fearing that the woman from the Meng family would be offended.

"Stop messing around, sister, let me tell you!" The little manager of the Meng family excitedly reached out and grabbed Mei Bao's shoulders, as if afraid she would run away. "Acting is the most profitable thing!"

As soon as she said these words, Mei Bao's face turned red. She suspected that the woman from the Meng family knew about her father's past and was deliberately mocking her.

"Ah! She's still a child. Just mentioning acting, and your ears are already turning red!" The other party really didn't mean it that way, and she didn't even know about Qiu Haitang's background, so she continued enthusiastically, "Sister, you're an educated person, do you also think that acting is a lowly thing? This is the Republic of China now. As long as you work hard, what kind of job isn't done by people? To be honest, if I had met Uncle Shang before I got married, I would have gone to act a long time ago...!" (165)

### The Doctrine of the Mean

— Jue Hui

Those who follow the "old ways" are called "half-baked," and those who follow the "new ways" are called "fence-sitters." Combining the two results in the Doctrine of the Mean.

The Doctrine of the Mean: advancing and retreating, sometimes left and sometimes right, jumping east and jumping west, changing back and forth... Today, they have a "spring breeze face," but tomorrow, they might open their bloody mouths to devour you.

But this is the most outstanding among those who follow the Doctrine of the Mean!

The next level is different: push them, and they move. Push them to the edge of the bowl, and they take a bite of food. Push them into the Huangpu River, and they don't care.

And then there's the lowest grade, which is even worse!

Closing the window will kill someone with a fever; opening the window will kill someone with malaria. He (the lowest grade) will open the window halfway. As a result, both people die.

The Doctrine of the Mean—I pray for its decline!

### Abandoning a Father's Corpse—With a Breath Still Remaining, Abandoned Like Worn-Out Shoes

— Feng

Night, a very deep night.

The shops on the roadside had already closed.

At the corner of the road, a solitary street lamp hung, its dim light flickering.

Loneliness reigned supreme...

Suddenly, in the distance, a dark shadow was slowly moving, moving...

After a while, the dark shadow disappeared.

But just a few minutes later, the dark shadow reappeared, slowly, slowly.

One step, one step, moving, moving:

A young fellow, carrying an old man with white hair on his back.

The young man was panting, and the old man's head was drooping. Staggering, swaying, they gradually approached the light.

A sallow face, withered hands, a face covered with tears...

Stopping for a moment, the young man looked around, as if afraid of something. Then, he sighed and put the old man down from his back.

Stiffly, the old man fell forward.

With a "thud!" he fell onto the asphalt road.

"Dad... Dad..." A soft, sorrowful voice came from his throat.

Unable to hold back any longer, large tears welled up from the young man's eyes. A white-haired, shriveled face... Clothes, thinly wrapped around his weak body. Pale teeth were exposed.

"Dad, I... I'm leaving..." His throat was choked.

Under the lamplight, their shadows were so monotonous.

Suddenly, a surge of courage rushed up, and the young man wiped away his tears with his sleeve, resolutely saying, "Dad, I'm leaving?"

### Fresh Stimulation

— Liu Ruli

Whenever someone throws a stone into one's chosen career circle, causing a wave or ripple, it always evokes some excitement or stimulation, especially if the stone-thrower is a friend.

Because I usually like to dabble in colors, I am always amazed by the flourishing of the isolated island's art scene. Compared to the desolate and bleak scene of Shanghai's art scene before the incident, we might not even have the courage to recall it.

Is the endless stream of art exhibitions because the general economic strength and cultural level of society have reached a point where there is a universal demand for the enjoyment of art?

Before creating, writers must decide between how to describe things and what to describe. "When the social form reaches a relatively smooth and developed period, at least outwardly maintaining a state of tranquility, the writer's concern should focus on how to describe rather than what to describe. Because in such times, the lives and thoughts of writers are relatively homogeneous, the expressive techniques of general writers become the object of interest and criticism and float to the surface..." Today's society is clearly not in the so-called period of sustained peace and tranquility, so we must set new criteria for criticism.

Today's isolated island artists are focusing all their efforts on how to cater to the market, and the so-called duty of artists has long been regarded as impractical talk.

Mr. Zhang Yuanji's solo exhibition has fewer than a hundred works, but the subject matter is very broad. In addition to the illusion of landscapes and the growth of flowers and trees, he has also paid more or less attention to this vast and boundless real world.

As far as I know, Mr. Zhang's creative desire is extremely strong, with a sense of endless expression, and he is also very diligent in painting, having acquired skillful techniques on his proper foundation. His solo exhibition may be a fresh stimulation.

### Han Langen and Yin Xiucen

— Wei Ren

Han: Hardworking, Enduring, Admires Chaplin. Yin: No Longer Interested in Comedic Roles

Han Langen is from Shanghai, 33 years old this year, born in the year of the Rooster. He has two wives and six children, with the seventh child due soon. He is currently the director of the drama department of Guolian. During his school days, he liked to play football and did not focus much on his studies. He was expelled from Minli and Nanyang schools, but he was determined to work in drama.

At the age of eighteen, he joined the Huichong Film Company, which was run by Zhang Huichong. Later, he transferred to the Shanghai Film Company, which was run by Dan Duyu. Finally, he joined Guolian and has been there ever since.

He has three special skills: he can move his ears, shake his hair, and make his chin and neck form a straight line.

He likes to take photos of his children, and he also likes swimming and ice skating, but he can't dance. He says, "The dance halls are too colorful and dazzling!"

His first film was "Skull Island." His most proud work is "Song of the Fishermen." On screen, he opposes the style of Laurel and Hardy and is the only believer in Chaplin. He has taken many photos imitating Chaplin. Recently, he has a plan to rewrite "City Lights" and portray the story himself.

For the past ten years, he has been living a hardworking and enduring life. His success can be compared to a "vehicle":

First, he rode a two-wheeled bicycle, then he rode a motorized bicycle, and now he drives a small car. The license plate number of the small car is "11866," which fans have translated as "Falling every day."

Yin Xiucen is from Tongzhou, Hebei, 32 years old this year, born in the year of the Dog. He has one wife and two children. He is an orphan. In school, he liked to play tennis. At the age of seventeen, he already weighed 205 pounds. At that time, his classmates nicknamed him "205 Pounds."

At the age of twenty, he was admitted to the Film Talent Training Institute, which was run by the fifth branch of Lianhua in Beiping. Later, he came to Shanghai to make films. His debut film was "New Grievances in the Forbidden City." He believes his most proud work is "Cold Moon and Poetry."

His characteristic is "shyness." In fact, his personality is very strong and he is not weak.

He has no interest in playing comedic roles. He says:

"People think I'm fat and always like to insult me, even the children on the street are like that. This makes me very sad. Recently, I have chosen a path to transform from comedic roles to serious ones. Feng Leshan in 'Home' is my first attempt. I want to keep working hard, but I'm afraid that my actions on screen will still make people laugh, and I will eventually be forced back into the comedic category."

Yin Xiucen has no particular hobbies. In the summer, he likes to eat watermelon and drink soda.

### Leftover Shen of Film Affairs

This journal published an article entitled "Random Talks on Film Affairs" on the 18th, discussing the Marx Brothers and the Li Zisans. The author said: "Comparing these two sets of three brothers, the acting skills of the Li Zisans are slightly better." But I believe that both belong to unconscious fooling around, and there is not much difference to be made. The acting skills of the Li Zisans are merely able to roll their eyes and make playful movements—Xin Juan sings funny songs; as for the Marx Brothers, each of them has a special skill, so in terms of acting skills, I think the Marx Brothers are slightly better than the Li Zisans, but the Marx Brothers' fooling around is more excessive than the Li Zisans.

The Marx Brothers have a total of five brothers, the ones who appear on the screen are the oldest brother Groucho, who wears a beard and smokes cigars, the second brother Chico, and the mute fourth brother Harpo. The eldest brother loves cigars, is good at golf, can sing and dance, and is used to making fleshy expressions on the screen; the second brother is well-versed in music, skilled in riding, violin, and especially good at playing the piano, and the "Beer Barrel Polka" he played in "A Night at the Opera" is just too good; the fourth brother is a mute who cannot speak, he is the most foolish one among these three treasures, he is good at tuning stringed instruments, which can be called a masterpiece.

The Marx Brothers do not have many works, only one per year, their first work on the screen was "Coconuts," the rest include "Animal Crackers," "Monkey Business," "Horse Feathers," "A Night at the Opera," "A Day at the Races" and so on.

### Chatting About the Linked Rings (Part 2)

— Lao Tu

(3) Zhu Guangzu

Miao Shengchun: Speaking of the first Zhu Guangzu in the South, who knows it has to be given to Miao Laosan? The reason why the Golden Bell is often ranked in the Linked Rings is because of Laosan's "living Guangzu". The clarity of his dialogue is far superior to Ma Fulu's reading of the indictment in the Temple of the Law, and Xiang Tianshuang's pretentious tone is even more flexible. Others can't even hope to reach his level. Unfortunately, his martial arts skills are lacking, and the scene of stealing the hook is inevitably inferior.

Liu Binsheng: A martial artist from the Li troupe, his skills are extremely agile. In the scene of stealing the hook, he spins three times in the circle, which is incomparably beautiful. His dialogue is a bit lispy, but it is not ambiguous. A promising talent.

Ye Shengzhang: This character who steals three times and one time of theft is of course quite impressive, especially the posture of stealing the hook, which is wonderfully ingenious. Northerners call it "Crisp," and Shengzhang can rightfully be called that.

Zhao Ruquan: Boss Zhao is a theatrical basket, and he wants to try every role. He can play You Liugui, Yang Xiangwu, and of course he can also play Zhu Guangzu, but he only gets applause with gimmicks and cannot be compared with the other characters.

Finally, I mischievously drew up a list of performers for the Linked Rings in Shanghai. What do you all think?

Huang Tianba – Liang Huichao

Dou Erdun – Gao Baisui

Zhu Guangzu – First Miao Shengchun, then Ai Shiju, then Zhang Yipeng.

### Nine Female Yue Opera Groups in a Gala Performance

— Ting Yu

The Shanghai Chinese Relief Association for Women and Children has been established for nearly 30 years, and it has been presided over by the elder Mr. Xu Qianlin. Over the years, it has rescued no less than tens of thousands of women and children, which is praised by society. After the "August 13th" incident, the Jiangwan campus was destroyed, and the reception became a problem. Now, Wen Lanting, Huang Yuzhai, Wang Miaoda, Wei Jin, and Sanhuang Yantang have launched a gala performance of nine female Yue opera groups, which will be held on the 28th and 29th at the Golden Theater. All proceeds from ticket sales will be used to build the campus in the future.

The association recently held a reception for all walks of life at the Xindu Hotel. Chairman Huang Yuzhai reported on the purpose of the performance and immediately promoted the sale of tickets, totaling approximately 30,000 yuan. Cheng Zhiliang individually recognized the sale of 5,000 yuan, an unprecedented event. According to Mr. Huang, the highest ticket price this time is 25 yuan per person, breaking the record for previous charity performances, but it is estimated that the total ticket sales can reach 60,000 yuan, so the main female roles of the nine female Yue opera groups have been designing and making novel costumes, and there will be amazing performances at that time. Brief News (1) The Shanghai Theatrical Press Association was established at the Dadong Restaurant the other day to prepare for the establishment of a preparatory committee. Lu Ying, Jiang Hanchu, Qiu Fuxin, Lu Nongying, Qian Xiaoan, and Ying Zhanpeng were elected as preparatory committee members, and colleagues who write about Peking opera, movies, Yue opera, and Shen opera are welcome to join. The address is temporarily located at No. 40 Jiaotong Road. (2) Harmonica music can be said to be very popular at the moment. Recently, the Shanghai Harmonica Association and the Shanghai Harmonica Factory have launched a city-wide harmonica solo championship to promote harmonica music and increase the interest of harmonica enthusiasts. Anyone who believes that they have a higher level of harmonica can participate. The preliminary round will be held on August 2 at the YMCA auditorium on Sichuan Road. There will be a total of three competitions. The finals will be held at the Lido Ballroom. There will be prizes for the first to twentieth place winners. The registration location is the Shanghai Harmonica Association in the Zhonghe Building on Nanjing Road.

(24) Ru Fulan

Ru Fulan is the younger brother of the famous clown Ru Danghui, also from a family of actors. His courtesy name is Zifeng, and he was a top student of the Fu character generation of the Fu Liancheng Opera School. When he first entered the school, because the young male lead Cheng Lianxi had just graduated, and there was a lack of talent in young male leads, he was made to study young male roles, excelling in both Kunqu and miscellaneous operas. He was proficient in pheasant-feathered generals, fan-wielding scholars, and official-belted scholars. The Fu troupe relied on him as a pillar of young male roles. Later, the teacher saw that his martial arts skills were excellent, and also because there were few martial arts students in the Fu character generation, he decided to have him switch to playing martial arts roles. He was quite impressive in roles like "Battle of Puyang" and "Eight Great Hammers." The troupe leader, Mr. Ye Chunshan, cherished his talent and married his eldest daughter to him. He is now forty-one years old and has three sons. The eldest, named Yuanjun, is studying martial arts in the sixth Yuan character generation of Fu Liancheng.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 13: Refusing to Bow the Head Among the Weeds

Li Zicheng fought fiercely for a long time and captured Ningwu Pass. Fearing that there were still Zhou Yuji's subordinates lurking in the vicinity outside the pass, he was determined to clear the area before advancing east. Therefore, he sent two brave generals, Bao Heitan and Qiang Kesheng, with five hundred cavalry to search for government troops outside the pass. The two men obeyed Li Zicheng's orders and went outside the city. Although they did not encounter any government troops, they went to various villages and towns to harass, rape, slaughter, and burn as they pleased, committing all kinds of evil. The villagers were terrified at the sight of the rebels and fled in droves. Bao Heitan and Qiang Kesheng were both from the bandit world and used to slaughtering people. Seeing so many refugees, they not only had no pity but wanted to kill them all. They seized young women to satisfy their lust. Bao Heitan had already snatched two beautiful women and ordered his men to tie them on horseback, following him as he rode. Unexpectedly, they encountered Xu Jing and Liu Yingying. The cavalry in front had already rushed in front of them. Seeing that they were both riding horses, one holding a spear and the other a sword, looking like two young martial artists rather than refugees, they suspected that they were junior officers in the government army. There were only two of them, so the rebels did not take them seriously. With a shout, they immediately charged towards them. Xu Jing immediately raised his spear and plunged into the midst of the cavalry. Liu Yingying also brandished her White Dragon Sword and followed closely. The sword flashed, and seven or eight cavalrymen fell from their horses one after another. Xu Jing's silver spear, thrusting left and right, also overturned three or four riders. Only then did the rebels realize that these two were not easy to deal with. Just then, Bao Heitan, riding his black horse and wielding two knives, galloped over. Behind him, a white horse carried two bound women, their jade faces pale and their tears falling like rain, guarded by four soldiers in front and behind. When Liu Yingying saw this, she was even more furious. She squeezed her legs tightly, urging her horse straight towards Bao Heitan, shouting, "How dare the rebels rob virtuous women! Watch me take your dog's life!" (122)
