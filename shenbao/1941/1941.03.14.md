### Unworthy of Belief: Japanese Propaganda Tactics

A celebration telegram: A responsible government official stated today that the report in Tokyo newspapers claiming that Dr. Cooley had made a report to President Roosevelt unfavorable to China is purely Japanese propaganda and not worthy of recognition. Before leaving China to return to the United States, Dr. Cooley said, "I am convinced of the greatness of China's future," which can refute the Japanese claim that he views Chongqing as undemocratic.

### Central Government Restricts Communist Party Activities, Strengthens National Unity; Will Not Allow Further Communist Party Advances in Military and Political Affairs; If Policies Are Not Changed, Friction May Still Be Unavoidable

Chongqing: According to reliable sources here, for the sake of national unity, the central government does not want to attack the Communist army, but it cannot allow the Communist Party to continue to make advances in military and political affairs. The central government's disbandment of the New Fourth Army was the result of long-standing friction and was also a necessary measure to maintain military discipline. The Communist Party accuses the government of oppression and not allowing freedom of speech and political opinion, but Communist Party members are still free to travel to and from Chongqing, and their newspaper, the New China Daily, is openly published here, so the oppression exerted by the Communist Party cannot be compared. In fact, the Communist Party's foreign policy reflects Moscow's attitude, so it is often said humorously that the New China Daily is "the Chongqing edition of Pravda." A few months ago, the rice shortage riots in Chengdu were widely believed to have been instigated by Communist elements, but there was no concrete evidence. People here expect that if the Communist Party does not change its policies, friction will still be unavoidable, but it will not disrupt China's war effort, as the central government can handle everything and has the support of the people and other political parties. (Reuters report from the 13th)

Chongqing: Today, a reporter asked the Chinese military spokesman about the news of the conflict between the central army in northern Anhui and the New Fourth Army. The spokesman replied that the New Fourth Army had been disbanded, so there was no longer any New Fourth Army unit. However, conflicts occasionally occur between the central army and bandit troops in the area. Another reporter asked whether the Eighteenth Group Army was still obliged to retreat to the area north of the Yellow River. The spokesman replied that this order was jointly issued by He Yingqin and Bai Chongxi and is still valid. (Reuters report from the 13th)

The Times Publishes Commentary

London: The foreign affairs correspondent of The Times recently published an article commenting on Generalissimo Chiang's statement regarding the situation of the Communist Party, stating that the Communist Party's demands, including the restoration of the disbanded army, the demarcation of special Communist areas, and the recognition of the Communist Party's special status, are unacceptable. The attitude of the Chinese government is extremely reasonable. The Chinese government has no ideological dispute with the Communist Party, but it is determined not to allow disobedience to military orders in the face of a formidable enemy, nor to allow the existence of two independent governments and armies within China. This dispute has not affected the Soviet Union's supply of military equipment to the Chinese government, which is worthy of attention. (Telegram from the 12th)

Editorial

### Communist Waves in the People's Political Council

Regarding the waves stirred by the Chinese Communist Party during the first session of the National Political Council, undoubtedly, the enemies are gloating, and the loved ones are heartbroken. Until the close of the conference, we did not hear that the Communist members of the council had a change of heart and attended. Furthermore, based on the taste of the conference declaration and the closing remarks made by Generalissimo Chiang, it can be seen that what the authorities have painstakingly achieved is only fully retaining the room for turning major issues into minor ones and minor issues into nothing, but they have not yet completely eliminated the waves. Therefore, those who are heartbroken are still inconsolable. This was originally not a sudden new problem; what is new is that the problem has become apparent. Assuming that the observation of political problems applies the general principle that it is better to have open conflict than secret struggles, then the surface-levelization of this problem is truly an evolution towards enlightenment. Because a problem has become a problem, the amount of its essence is neither lessened by being hidden nor increased by being surface-level. Hidden, it inevitably makes people worry about it as an unpredictable dark shadow, as an abyss, as a crisis; made apparent, it allows people to see and hear together, to understand that it is such and such. Openness is the best strategy for dispelling rumors, and frankness is enough to break the conspiracies of sowing discord. This is the foundation of working together in harmony, the prerequisite for sincere unity, and also the guiding principle followed by enlightened politicians. And at a meeting of this scale, discussing a problem of this scale, the utmost openness and the utmost frankness, is only obtained in a world with the spirit of democracy, only obtained under a leader who embraces the spirit of democracy. Thinking of this, although it is said that the matter is heartbreaking, it is also somewhat gratifying!

We, regarding this problem, and even regarding all problems related to Communism, do not consider ourselves lacking in courage and remain silent about it, but from the beginning, we believe that for this country and this day, national independence and freedom come first, and the integrity of sovereignty and territory comes first. Beyond this, no matter what the problem is, not only do we not discuss it now, but we also hope that no matter which side it is, it must decide on any problem that is determined by "first," and generally put it aside for now, to be left for future approval or opposition, to be left for future decisions on whether to take or abandon, follow or deviate. We feel this way, even though the problem has been fully surface-levelized in the People's Political Council, we still feel this way. Unexpectedly, readers are impatient. Based on many readers' letters, in addition to several key points, the conference declaration and Generalissimo Chiang's closing speech have clearly pointed out separately, please summarize them into the following points, to open up our humble opinions and correct them to all readers. First, any problem in the political realm often becomes a three-dimensional form because it is involved in many aspects both vertically and horizontally, and therefore, observations made from various three-dimensional aspects often lead to different concepts. Stubbornly adhering to one aspect of observation naturally leads to the error of knowing one but not knowing the other, but inheriting the theoretical approach of seeing benevolence and wisdom, and saying that there is no absolute right or wrong, and that contradictory right and wrong are allowed to coexist, often obscures the truth and covers up evil. The problem that has become apparent in this People's Political Council this time, although it seems complex, in fact, the issue of military orders is at its core; other problems may only be comparisons of strengths and weaknesses, but the unification of national military orders is absolute throughout ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, and in wartime, it is truly absolute of the absolute. If it is said that for the sake of so-called politics, for the sake of so-called doctrines, one should be tolerant and accommodating, this view does not apply to the issue of military orders; if it is said that for the sake of national crisis, it is not applicable to the issue of military orders. Second, since the disbandment of the New Fourth Army has already been implemented according to military orders, why not accept the Communist Party's request to increase the number of troops in a group army, so as to be both kind and strict, and to calm things down. Moreover, in wartime, there are never too many soldiers, so why be reluctant to allow it? In fact, only those who obey military orders are soldiers; being a soldier, only then can one talk about whether it is appropriate to have more or less; whether a certain party or faction within a national organization should form its own system and set up its own army is not discussed for the time being. How the military expenditure is, how the military equipment is equipped, and how the quality preparation of officers and soldiers at all levels is, all these important technical issues, assuming that there are solutions, are not discussed for the time being; however, how can one guarantee absolute obedience to military orders in the future? This is an absolute prerequisite that must be discussed and asked. Up to now, we have only heard defenses of the New Fourth Army, and we have only heard requests to increase the number of party troops, not to mention guarantees of obedience to military orders, and no promises to obey military orders have been provided. Third, the CCP's hope for the twelve conditions has led to a stalemate in the attendance of the seven Communist Party members of the Council. Regarding the twelve conditions, as answered by the government authorities and the Council, the right and wrong are very clear. However, comparing the nature of the conditions and the attitude of the answers, and further comparing them with the inevitable laws of any national organization, the painstaking efforts of the authorities to maintain the overall situation are clearly visible. Some people believe that it is better to cut off one's hand than to harbor a sting, it would be better to eliminate the communists; Generalissimo Chiang firmly said that he did not want to hear the ominous words of eliminating the communists again, even judging from the overall attitude of the CCP, the so-called elimination also requires great reservation. Because accepting the Three Principles of the People and supporting the national policy of resisting and building the country are the basic attitudes that the CCP must continue to maintain. Thinking of it from their perspective, no matter their subjective views or objective conditions, there is a need to maintain this state. Moreover, what the seven members hoped for from the Council, although their attitude and method are criticized by reason and emotion, they only failed to attend the conference, and did not withdraw from the Council, let alone announce overall non-cooperation with the overall situation. Although the group army they lead has neglected military orders, they only deviate from the norm, but they do not confront the national army.

The vertical length of China's history and the horizontal breadth of its territory intertwine to form a complex national condition; the occurrence of some waves at any time and any place is by no means unexpected. All waves should be regarded as unavoidable and inevitable setbacks in the process of nation-building. Just like the conditions put forward by the CCP members of the Council, they naturally hope that the government and the Council will accept them; they also know that cases awaiting public discussion and decision are by no means orders that must be executed, so approval or disapproval is only fifty-fifty. Once it is proven that it has been disapproved, they will naturally reconsider their attitude until it is agreeable and feasible. The key is for the general public to have a clear understanding of national affairs, understand them clearly, determine where the center of the nation lies, and love and protect it loyally. By overcoming all difficulties, we will eventually melt away all divisions to promote the greatness of the nation.

### The Second Anniversary of the Spiritual Mobilization: The Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Radio Address: Establishing a Common Faith, Unleashing Collective Consciousness, Emphasizing Scientific Spirit, Completing Secure National Defense, Cultivating National Sentiment, and Tempering the National Physique

Chongqing. Chairman Chiang of the National Spiritual Mobilization Council delivered a radio address on the second anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization. The full text is as follows:

Fellow countrymen at home and overseas! Today is the 16th anniversary of the death of our Founding Father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and also the second anniversary of our National Spiritual Mobilization. As we, the people of the whole country, remember our Founding Father, the great revolutionary mentor, we must remember his dying words, "The revolution has not yet succeeded." Especially now, when the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction awaits the completion by all of us, fellow countrymen, we must further recognize the meaning of "The nation first, the people first" and strive to achieve "Concentrated will, concentrated strength" to unleash the indomitable spirit of our nation. Today, we should conduct a thorough review of the work of the Spiritual Mobilization Movement and make further efforts. Since the launch of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, the spirit of our fellow countrymen throughout the country has been further invigorated, further promoted, and even more calm and determined. In particular, the struggles in the occupied areas, the efforts and donations of overseas compatriots, and the active construction by the people in the rear have demonstrated our nation's united spirit of shared hatred against the enemy. This spirit is sufficient to prove that the Chinese nation has a great foundation and infinite strength, elevating our nation's position and writing the most glorious history of "Justice triumphing over violence" for mankind. However, as we review the work of spiritual mobilization over the past two years, we cannot be satisfied with the achievements already made. At last year's National Spiritual Mobilization Commemoration Congress, I proposed four directions for our efforts. Now I hope that all of our fellow countrymen will seriously reflect on whether the outlines of spiritual mobilization have been concretely realized, to what extent we have strengthened economic struggle, whether the work competition movement has been widely implemented, whether the holding of national monthly meetings has been expanded on schedule, and whether national duties have been earnestly fulfilled. Especially, we must know that the success or failure of China's resistance and national reconstruction today is related to the safety of the global situation, and as our war approaches victory, we must have the determination to overcome any danger and difficulty. We must, during this period, create our whole country into one strong fighting body. I recently said that from now on, we must not only promote our spirit, but also pay attention to practical action. Therefore, I want to propose three points to awaken the attention of the people of the whole country: First, establish a common faith, unleash collective consciousness, and promote social discipline, which is organized action. Everyone knows that mobilization on time is a highly organized action. Without a sound social organization, full wartime mobilization cannot be achieved. Without a common faith and collective consciousness, a national social organization and unified action cannot be created. The significance of our Spiritual Mobilization lies in concentrating the spirit of the people of the whole country towards a simple and common goal, so that the people of the whole country can strive and sacrifice for the same faith based on the same moral values. Moreover, the essence of social discipline is to value spiritual organization, which requires us to firmly establish our nation's common belief in the Three Principles of the People. We must know that only with a common faith can we have common strength. We must also create a collective consciousness for the entire nation, eliminate outdated and backward individualism and the selfish concepts of parties, and regard the entire nation as a fighting body, obeying the orders of the entire national will, to take the overall action. We must contribute everyone's freedom for the country's freedom. All aspects of our personal lives and actions must create strict discipline, without any scattered and divergent phenomena. We must be consistent from beginning to end, share life and death, and truly implement the collective life of combat, which is to make each of our citizens capable of fighting. Therefore, our society should be like an army. The activities of each of our citizens in various departments must absolutely obey orders and strictly abide by discipline unconditionally. We must be united nationwide, faithfully believe in the Three Principles of the People, abide by national duties, and strive for the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, and strive to win the victory of the national war and the success of national reconstruction. In short, we must make the requirements of the Spiritual Mobilization Outline permeate the organization of various people's groups and social organizations, forming a universal trend. Only in this way can we build a strong

spiritual fortress. With a strong spiritual fortress, we can talk about true social organization and disciplined action, and only then can we truly win the final victory. Second, enhance the scientific spirit, popularize science and technology, complete the Founding Father's industrial plan, and promote the scientific national defense. The current era is an era of science, especially an industrial era of scientific and mechanized national defense. All national construction must be centered on national defense, and all national defense construction must utilize the highest degree of scientific spirit and scientific technology. "Without science, there is no national defense; without national defense, there is no nation." In our three years and eight months of war, we deeply realize that modern warfare is a scientific war. Through the course of this war, we must further

deeply understand the power of science. In the past, we launched a long-term war with a revolutionary spirit, but we must pay more attention to scientific spirit and scientific technology in order to complete our permanent and secure national defense and achieve our ultimate victory. Therefore, in the future, our national defense construction and national combat skills must be scientific, mechanized and industrialized. On the one hand, this depends on our government's complete plan, and on the other hand, it also requires our general intellectual class, knowledgeable experts, and educators to take exceptional enthusiasm to strive for inventions, research, and training, to complete our Founding Father's industrial plan, to realize the most concrete economic construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and to make all national facilities productive. We must remember our Founding Father's

legacy of "All power in our hands," and we must appreciate the various teachings of our Founding Father's advocacy of science during his lifetime. In various aspects of education and training, we must cultivate a new spirit of national emphasis on science and love for machinery, and create national skills and habits of using mechanical tools, so that "All power in our hands" and "Saving the nation through science" become a universal understanding of every citizen. Therefore, in our spiritual mobilization work, we must awaken the people of the whole country to consciously pay attention to the scientific spirit, and use planned work to improve national production, and we must awaken the people of the whole country to learn scientific technology, practice diligence and hard work, and strive for national defense and economic construction to ensure the final victory of our resolute war. Third, popularize music and sports, promote the national spirit, and promote

the modernization of national life. Music is to stimulate noble national emotions, and sports are to temper strong national physique. Both are the most important conditions for promoting our national spirit. "Propriety and music cannot be neglected" is an ancient motto of our country. "A sound mind in a sound body" is a truism. The fundamental meaning of the five major items listed in our National Spiritual Mobilization lies in the thorough transformation of the national spirit. The so-called thorough transformation of the national spirit first requires the enrichment of the national spirit, making the spirit of the people of the whole country enthusiastic, vigorous, strong, and brave, with the power to overcome the environment and resist any difficulty. Second, it requires the concentration of the national spirit, making the spirit of the people of the whole country neat, united,

and united in one mind to achieve a state of shared interests, life and death. Third, it requires the revolutionization of the national spirit, making the people of the whole country thoroughly reform the old habits of selfishness, love the country and the nation, and not hesitate to sacrifice everything to devote themselves to the cause of revolution. To achieve these three standards, the most basic work is to start with cultivating national sentiment and tempering the national physique. We must use collective music to cultivate a vigorous and lively national spirit, so that every citizen has rich emotions, an upward spirit, an optimistic mood, and vigorous energy. We must use universal national sports to temper the nation's strong and solid physique, so that every citizen has the instinct to endure hardship and the virtue of hard work. Today, the collective music chorus and sports performance in Chongqing are the

a feature of this year's Spiritual Mobilization Commemoration. I hope that all parts of the country can actively strive to do the work of popularizing sports and music, making it a trend. It is certain that the enhancement of our physique and the improvement of national emotions can be advanced, enhancing our great national spirit and becoming the greatest force driving the resistance and national reconstruction. The three points mentioned above, "social discipline" is to achieve "social militarization," "national defense scientification" is to achieve "national productionization," and "modernization of national life" is to make "national life artistic." On the second anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization, I put forward these three goals to the people of the whole country as a concrete effort in promoting spiritual mobilization in the future. This is consistent with the purpose of my advocacy of the New Life Movement for the past seven years. Everyone should know that all our efforts, all our struggles and sacrifices, are aimed at creating our independent and free China. This year is particularly important. From now on, all our work must be more practical and more earnest, to complete the mission of the national revolution, so that we can be worthy of the martyrs, worthy of our national ancestors and future generations, and so that we can comfort our Founding Father in heaven. Compatriots, spiritual mobilization is a movement for our nation to rise from the dead. It must not be regarded as an ordinary movement. Compatriots, we must not forget our sacred duty to be loyal to the country and filial to the nation. Therefore, we must always understand the meaning of morality, know integrity and shame, and promote our national spirit of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony and peace, and strive together to be worthy of the citizens of the Republic of China. May everyone encourage each other. (12th dispatch)

### Shanghai Trade Situation Receives Great Attention from Britain

London. Conservative MP Hannah stated in the House of Commons yesterday that he was extremely dissatisfied with the entire status of Shanghai trade. The government should order consular officials to prepare a report, which must pay attention to the rumors of Japanese officials soliciting bribes. Furthermore, the Japanese side has obstructed the waterway between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, causing difficulties for British shipping. The government should implement a retaliatory plan against Japanese shipping in British ports. Undersecretary Butler replied that the British government had detailed information on the Shanghai trade situation. The British government has negotiated with the Japanese government for a long time, but without result. The British government is constantly reviewing ways to remedy the current situation, and has now ordered the consulate to report the latest situation. Regarding the information on the seven-point program of the Anti-British Joint Association in Beiping, Butler immediately said that there was no evidence that the association's activities were directly sponsored by the Japanese authorities. However, the Beiping Central Radio Station under Japanese control has issued anti-British remarks. This movement does not seem to have reached any important degree, but the British side is closely monitoring its future development. (Reuters, 13th)

### Hong Kong Aircraft Purchase Fund Reaches $80,000

### US President Asks Congress to Allocate 7 Billion: Expand Various Armaments as Soon as Possible to Help Democratic Countries Resist Aggression

Washington. President Roosevelt sent a letter to Speaker of the House Rayburn, attaching a detailed budget of US$7 billion to aid Britain and other countries. The President urgently hopes that Congress will immediately pass this appropriation. The budget is divided into several categories, the largest of which is the $2 billion budget for aircraft and parts. In addition to stipulating the huge number of various war equipment, it also allocates $629,000,000,000 for ships of all sizes and other aircraft and spare parts. The expenses for testing, inspection and repair of national defense equipment of any government that the President considers to be of great relevance to US defense are also stipulated as $200,000,000,000. A large portion of this amount will be used to repair British ships based in the United States. The President's letter contains a warning sentence, which reads, "Our country has decided to do its best to create a sufficient arsenal for the use of democratic countries. This arsenal should be established in our country, not only as a fortress for our own defense, but also as a source of national defense equipment for all democratic countries that resist aggression and seek survival." Various plans are being drawn up in the hope that Congress will pass this budget quickly. Debate may be submitted one day next week. Speaker Rayburn has stated that the House will put aside all other matters and focus on this budget. (Reuters, 13th)

Washington. President Roosevelt yesterday asked Congress to immediately allocate $7,000,000,000 based on the Lend-Lease Act. President Roosevelt's message to the House of Representatives stated, "The United States feels that in order to ensure the security of poor countries, it should encourage democratic countries to continue to fight bravely to resist aggressor countries." Attached to the President's message was an analysis by Budget Director Smith, stating that this $7,000,000,000 should be temporarily available to fund expenses until June 30, 1934. (United Press, 13th)

London. Informed sources here stated yesterday that the US Lend-Lease Act can not only prevent German aggression, but also solve the British food shortage. The meeting between US Ambassador to Britain Winant and British Food Minister Woolton yesterday is enough to show that the United States will quickly assist Britain in solving Britain's food and shipping problems. The two problems of food and shipping are directly related to the general war situation. People here generally feel that if Hitler can sink enough British ships to cause a food shortage, British morale will inevitably decline, and Hitler can risk an invasion attempt. If Britain can obtain the US food supply through the Lend-Lease Act, not only will Britain's food problem be solved, but Britain's severe shipping situation will also be relaxed. (United Press, 13th)

US Unlimited Supply of Oil to Britain and Delivery of Flying Fortresses to Britain

London. News from New York says that the US government has approved the unlimited export of oil production to all parts of the British Empire (Reuters, 13th)

New York. American newspapers are publishing the steps to supply Britain with war equipment. According to a Washington correspondent of a news agency, it was learned that long-range bombers, namely "Flying Fortresses," will be shipped to Britain first. Some have already been shipped. Escorting light bombers and speedboats will also be shipped to Britain one after another. The United States will supply Greece with light tanks and machine guns. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Washington. It was announced here today that US aircraft manufacturers can now produce about a thousand aircraft per month. The production volume in February was 972, of which 879 were delivered to British and American troops. The total amount of goods delivered in February decreased by 64 compared to January. (Reuters, 13th)

Washington. Reliable sources here last night said that Truman, the chairman of the National Defense Investigation Committee and a member of the People's Wang Party, is preparing a plan to investigate the entire situation of the national defense process, including strikes, the liaison of government advisors, the adjudication of arms contracts, the profits of production, and the efficiency of wartime industries. The first batch of witnesses will include Secretary of the Army Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chairman of the National Defense Committee Knudsen, and Labor Expert of the National Defense Committee Hillman. Hillman boldly proposed yesterday to stop strikes to facilitate production. Hill announced that the shipbuilding industry has held several labor-management meetings to prevent the supply of warships to Britain from being hindered under the Lend-Lease Act.

Washington. Former Director of the War Industries Board Baruch said yesterday that if the American people obey industrial mobilization, the United States can "save Britain without firing a shot" and defeat Germany's plan to dominate the world. As a veteran politician, Baruch is highly regarded in Washington. He decided to make his rare remarks, saying that if American industry is mobilized and properly controlled, it can fully assist the British, so that the British can resist the Germans for a long time, and thereby defeat Germany economically, causing the collapse of German markets all over the world. Baruch said, "Once American industry is mobilized, it will become a weapon that can be attacked and defended. Its potential power is unmatched. In my opinion, its horror is beyond human imagination." Baruch admitted that his proposed plan was quite severe, but Baruch believed that if the United States not only seeks to defeat evil forces in the present, but also seeks to survive in the future, it must take severe measures.

British Prime Minister Thanks the United States for the Passage of the Lend-Lease Act on Behalf of Britain

London. British Prime Minister Churchill made a brief speech in the House of Commons yesterday on the passage of the Lend-Lease Act by the US Congress. Every word he spoke was met with cheers from the crowd. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, all the members of the House cheered loudly for a long time before stopping. Churchill said, "I am sure that the House of Commons wishes me at this time to express our deep and respectful gratitude for the generous and visionary policy of the United States. The most powerful democratic country in the world has now in practice declared its willingness to guarantee the overthrow of Nazism with its great industrial and financial power, so that all countries, large and small, may live in safety, tolerance and freedom. The US government and people have a new Magna Carta, not only valuing the rights and laws on which sound and progressive civilization depends, but also demonstrating in words and deeds that free people and countries everywhere should share the responsibility for maintaining rights and laws. I hereby express my gratitude to the United States on behalf of the government of this country and in the name of all freedom-loving people." All members of the House unanimously supported the government's remarks and did not want to ask supplementary questions. Therefore, when Liberal MP Granville stood up to speak after the Prime Minister's speech, there were calls to stop him from speaking. In fact, Granville only asked if the Prime Minister could broadcast to the United States in the same tone and let the British people hear it, so that the British people's gratitude to the United States would be known to all. Churchill replied that he must choose the most appropriate time. When the Prime Minister made this speech in the House of Commons, six members of the US military mission in Britain to handle aviation-related matters were listening in the House of Commons.

London. This morning's newspapers commented on the passage of the Lend-Lease Act, saying that it had historical relations. The Times said that this move will be remembered in the future, and is regarded as a turning point in the European situation, and its importance is no less than that of the United States joining World War I in 1917. The United States is united in the face of Hitlerism, which is enough to encourage Britain and its free friends. The rude comments of German and Italian newspapers have now revealed their fear. Japan is particularly uneasy when it hears the news just as its Foreign Minister Matsuoka is about to leave for Europe. The effect of this move will not only accelerate the continuous import of various munitions from the United States into Britain, but also allow the US President to dispose of ordinary payment procedures at will. According to the provisions of the case, various items can be rented to Britain for use, and there are no money loans. It is only stipulated that Britain will return the original goods to the United States at a later date, or use materials that the United States will need in the future as compensation. This is the first clear and formal announcement that it does not want to repeat the unconscious financial burden of wartime debts, which has caused economic disasters in the past twenty years. The Daily Telegraph said that the great natural resources and industrial and financial assets of the United States, once collected and applied in such a decisive war, are a great force, which is known to the world, and Nazism and Fascism are clearly aware of it in their anger. Italy's threat to declare war on the United States has made its position even more shameful. Germany is vainly opposed to "offensive intervention." The feeling of the two countries after the passage of the bill is indeed not far away. The substantive results of this move by the United States are very great, but the spiritual benefits are no less important. (Reuters, 13th)

Administrator McNutt Says US Should Retain Control of the Philippines

Washington. Federal Security Administrator McNutt said in a speech to 500 women here yesterday, "The United States will stay in the Far East." He said that the United States is capable of defending the Philippines against Japan in cooperation with the Philippine military. He also predicted that the great port of the Far East in the future will not be Shanghai but Manila. McNutt said that the place where the United States appears as a trading nation will not be Europe but Asia. He also urged the establishment of an "agreement that can be accepted by both sides" with the Filipinos, so that the United States can maintain its ruling position. McNutt said, "If the United States intends to accept the request of the Filipinos, ordinary Filipinos will invite Americans to stay in the Philippines." He also said that if the United States withdraws from the Far East, "We will lose 13 kinds of extremely important military raw materials." (United Press, 13th)

### Although the Thai-Vietnamese Dispute is Resolved, the Situation in the Pacific Remains Tense; Japan's Southern Advance Plan Continues Unabated

Moscow – The Soviet Army organ, Red Star newspaper, commented on the current situation, saying that the situation in the Pacific is still tense and has not eased slightly due to the resolution of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. After the establishment of the new Thai-Vietnamese border, Japan's influence in that area of the Pacific will increase even more. Therefore, although the Thai-Vietnamese conflict has been resolved, Japanese warships are still concentrated in the South Seas, and similar plans are still underway, so the situation in the South Seas is still tense. (Reuters, 13th)

Vichy – Well-informed sources here recently gave an explanation regarding the situation of Vietnam ceding territory to Thailand in accordance with the agreement, stating briefly that the territory is divided into two areas, one in the north, located west of the upper Mekong River, originally belonging to the Kingdom of Laos (French protectorate), and the other in the south, located west of the Phnom Penh River in eastern Cambodia, which is the floodplain of the lower Mekong River. In terms of geographical situation and economic value, the latter is actually more important. The northern area only forms a narrow strip of land between the mountains and the Mekong River, while the latter is located west and northwest of Tonle Sap Lake, stretching from Pakse and Si Sophon to Sisophon. Although there are many vast forests in between, Battambang Province has fertile soil and a dense population, and its economic position is quite important. (Havas, 13th)

Company officials stated that only a small amount of gasoline and oil stocks remain in Battambang and will not be relocated. The company has sent Americans to Battambang to take care of the property after the cession of the area. An American company official stated that the company is trying to continue operating after the cession of the area. However, Shell Oil Company has begun to transport its large quantities of gasoline and oil stored in Battambang. These stocks were previously used by the French army. The company has several oil pools there. At the same time, a Japanese patrol ship will leave here tomorrow, leaving only one torpedo boat here. Today, five Japanese soldiers here were injured in a cargo truck accident. (United Press, 13th)

### On the Albanian Front, the Italian Prime Minister Personally Commands the Counterattack, Attempting to Boost Morale and Comfort the People, but the Result is Completely Defeated by the Greek Army

Athens – It has now been confirmed that Mussolini is indeed in the central section of the Albanian front. A Greek official spokesperson stated that it is now believed that the recent Italian counterattack plan was drafted by Mussolini. (Reuters, 13th)

London – It is rumored that Mussolini has rushed to the Albanian front to command the recent Italian counterattack, but the result does not seem to have achieved the expected goals. A wireless telegram from Athens last night stated that Mussolini's purpose in this trip was to try to obtain some good results so that he could comfort his suffering people when he returned to Rome on Saturday. However, according to news received from Albania today, the continuous Italian counterattacks have developed into a general counterattack along a twelve-mile front, and the result has been completely defeated and severely damaged by the Greek army. London's commentary on Mussolini's visit to Albania also pointed out that although the elite Italian Arippini unit reappeared on the battlefield, it did not make any progress. This morning, an Athens radio telegram stated that Mussolini is now personally commanding the spring offensive against Greece, which the Italian General Headquarters is deliberately promoting. Mussolini's purpose in this trip is not only to boost morale but also to achieve practical results. An Italian officer captured yesterday admitted that Mussolini was indeed on the central front for the past five days, not only giving orders but also personally commanding the Italian counterattack. However, under Mussolini's supervision, the Italian army still did not make any progress and suffered heavy casualties. When Mussolini returns to Rome, he may bring back nothing but alarming news. (Reuters, 13th)

London – The Athens radio station claimed last night that Mussolini had been supervising the war in Albania for five days, and he said that he would return to Rome on Saturday. The station also broadcast a Greek intelligence bulletin stating that the Italian counterattack failed for three days, so from dawn on Tuesday, a general offensive was launched in the central region along a twelve-mile-long front line, but it was repelled everywhere and suffered heavy losses. The Greek army still maintained the initiative and did not lose an inch of land. Fierce battles occurred on the entire front for many hours. The Greek artillery bombarded fiercely, making it even more difficult for the enemy to succeed. The Greek army firmly guarded the positions it had captured, and the Greek army chased away the Italian army with bayonet charges, capturing three senior Italian officers. It has now been confirmed that the Italian army in Albania has lost a total of 130,000 people. The Athens radio station also broadcast a Greek military headquarters bulletin last night stating that the enemy's intensified counterattack had no results, and its offensive was repelled by the Greek army, with extremely heavy deaths. The Greek air force assisted the army in combat. The Greek side captured 200 enemy soldiers, including four military officers. (Reuters, 13th)

Rome – Official circles here today denied the rumors that Italian Minister of Education Bottai and Minister of Commerce Guan Zanatti had recently been killed in action in Albania.

Athens – According to reliable military observers, the Italian army lost a total of 10,000 people in the four days of fierce fighting in Albania. The Blackshirts, apparently due to Mussolini's personal presence on the front line, repeatedly decided to counterattack the central region in an attempt to recapture the important heights in the Tepelene area. This attack suddenly subsided yesterday afternoon and has now completely stopped today. (Reuters, 13th)

Athens – The large-scale battle between Italy and Greece, stretching from the Yugoslav border to the coast, is extremely terrible and has been going on for the sixth day today. The battlefield is like a large slaughterhouse. The Greek army's massive offensive is gradually rolling forward. In order to resist the Greek army's advance, the largest Italian reinforcements since the start of the war have been added. According to border reports, all battlefields are full of Italian corpses, like tombs. Italian prisoners of war are being transported to the Greek rear in a steady stream, reaching 3,500 in five days. Eighteen Italian tanks were destroyed on the battlefields of Kleisoura and the Aoos Valley. (United Press International, 13th)

Athens – The Greek Ministry of the Navy announced today that the Greek hospital ship "Socrates" was bombed by Italian seaplanes near the Ionian Islands.

British Forces in East Africa Continue to Advance, Occupying Two Italian Ports

Cairo – A British military headquarters bulletin stated that British imperial forces continued to advance in Italian Somaliland, occupying Daga Bur (600 miles north of Mogadishu) on Sunday.

British forces in other areas are continuing to pursue the Italian army that is retreating towards the Abyssinian border. British and patriotic Abyssinian forces in Abyssinia are also rapidly advancing in pursuit, and the Italian army that fled from Boi to Taibaila Ramakos is expected to defend the Danmiha River. British forces in western Abyssinia are marching in two directions, using camel routes across the grassland towards Arosa. Arosa is still heavily garrisoned by the Italian army. The East African army has occupied the Afdu slope, opening the way to capture Afdu, and ambushed the Italian army, capturing a lot of war materiel. It is reported that British forces in Abyssinia are now rushing towards the important center of Harar by truck, advancing 120 miles in two days. Except for intermittent harassment by Italian aircraft, they have not encountered Italian resistance. According to a military spokesperson, the British army entered from the rear, while the Italian army was planning its defenses in the north and did not expect the British army to attack from the south. The war materiel captured by the British army in Somaliland included 345,000 gallons of motor transport vehicle gasoline, 2,000 gallons of aviation gasoline, 3,000 tons of rice, 7,000 tons of sugar, and 850 tons of artificial oil. The only two Italian-owned ports on the Indian Ocean have been occupied by the British army, and 11 Italian ships and 4 German ships have been captured or destroyed. (Reuters, 13th)

### British Expeditionary Force; Rumored to Have Landed in Greece; Eden Holds Talks with Turkish Prime Minister; Turkey Forms Special Paratrooper Unit

Washington – Reliable sources say that British troops have landed in Greece. International circles here still remember that during the previous World War, it was generally believed that the success of the Salonika front was the turning point for the Allied victory. Therefore, this landing has aroused hopes for a repeat of history here. It is believed that if Germany cannot reach the oil fields beyond or nearest to Suez, it cannot achieve a major victory by occupying Greece. It is believed that before the British troops landed, there was an agreement between Britain and Turkey, and the Soviet Union would never attack Turkey or assist Germany. (United Press International, 13th)

London – A German plane attempted to attack the United States yesterday. One of them was hit, caught fire and crashed. Loud anti-aircraft gunshots were heard several times in the London area. A veteran who participated in the previous war said that the sound of artillery fire last night was so fierce that it was comparable to the sound of artillery used to bombard enemy positions on land during the previous war. Such fierce artillery fire had never been heard during previous air raids on Britain, so this point may indicate that land defenses have been improved. (Reuters, 13th)

### Third Anniversary of Germany's Annexation of Austria: Hitler Arrives in Linz to Deliver a Speech to 40,000 People, Enhancing Strength to Build a Greater Germany

Linz: Führer Hitler suddenly arrived here last night at 9 PM, and the people lined the streets to welcome him with great enthusiasm. It is reported that Hitler's visit is to participate in the third anniversary commemoration of the German-Austrian union. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

Linz: Yesterday was the third anniversary of the German-Austrian union. 40,000 people eagerly listened to Hitler's speech. Hitler first recalled the excitement of this day three years ago when he was able to deliver a speech in his hometown. Next, he detailed how National Socialism enhanced Germany's power, allowing it to resist foreign aggression. Germany's internal unity enabled it to break free from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler compared Germany's current situation with that of 1871 when Bismarck completed the unification of the German Empire, pointing out that there was no shortage of people outside who were jealous and hostile towards Germany at that time, but in the end, Germany was able to overcome its enemies and achieve its wishes. This time, it will surely succeed as well. Germany now has the strong organization of the National Socialist Party, an army that looks down on all of Europe and wins every battle, and a united people as its backing. He was deeply gratified to be able to make such bold statements in his hometown. A year ago, Churchill expressed doubts about the solidarity of the German people. At that time, he assured him that facts would force him to change his attitude in the future. Churchill should know that what he said was true. Hitler also mentioned Germany's battle against the old world dominated by gold and capital. Germany's economic life is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the progress of German industry and the increase in production volume in just a few years have created such a great undertaking and achievement, which can be said to be unprecedented in German history. In the past three years, Austria has participated in the plan to build a greater Germany with excellent results. Looking back on the past today, can we not be happy? Hitler also stated that Germany will win the final victory. At that time, we can realize all our plans. The Greater Germany will become a country of social community life. This kind of work has already been initiated in many ways, some are still in progress, and some have been completed, too numerous to list. Hitler concluded by saying that we do not need to implore or thank a certain class of people, and we are not servants of anyone. In our minds, all beliefs are tied to the self-reliance of the German people, no matter where they are, east, west, north, or south, there is only one object, and what is that object? Greater Germany! (Haitong Telegram, 13th)

### Random Talks on the European War (40): The Progress of British Tanks

The British "Nile Army" was able to defeat the Italian army at a thousand miles a day in the "Western Desert" area of Africa, mostly due to the strength of its light and heavy tanks. The following is a translation of the report from the London Times's on-site correspondent:

The British armored car division has "light fitting" teams, light repair teams, supply teams, and an engineering team in the rear, ready to undertake major repairs to prevent any hindrance to the movement of tanks.

There are heavy tanks and cruiser tanks, as well as small and agile reconnaissance tanks called "The Dingo." This type of reconnaissance tank is equipped with thick armor and bulletproof tires, and the engine has great power, able to move forward or backward at 60 miles per hour without turning around.

This type of reconnaissance tank has great use. If it encounters the enemy during reconnaissance, it can quickly evade to a side road, and can also carry the infantry commander to the front line to reconnoiter the enemy's situation. It can also transmit military orders when radio communication is stopped.

The development of this type of motorized unit in Britain is truly the most powerful combat weapon of the army, and also the most brilliant page in British war history, showing that Britain has regained its leadership position that it had lost for many years. In terms of quantity, British tanks cannot yet match Germany, but the British army's organization and strategy are progressing rapidly, and tanks are also being manufactured in large quantities, and certain types of tanks, with their strong armor, fierce firepower, and rapid movement, are truly beyond the dreams of other countries.

Modern tanks, in certain circumstances, are more complex machines than airplanes, and their operation all relies on the training received by the tank crew. Each tank has four soldiers, and in an emergency, each person must be able to take on each other's work. For example, the gunner and the radio operator must be able to drive the tank out of danger in the event of an accident, regardless of their personal safety, because a heavy tank is worth 25,000 pounds.

In the training camp of the armored force, an ordinary person undergoes just sixteen weeks of training to become a soldier and an excellent technician. They are often divided into small groups, surrounding the instructors, studying the infinite mysteries of modern machinery. They must learn the assembly skills necessary for tank crew members, and must practice target shooting with air guns on moving tank models. When they are fully trained, they drive tanks to conduct field exercises, firing two-pound practice rounds, or using "Besa" machine guns to practice target shooting. The British training method is to have soldiers shoot while moving, while the German training method is to have soldiers stand still and shoot.

Tank gunners, like airplane gunners, are often given special attention, and their salaries are already higher than others. The tank's power really depends on the gunner's skills.

The British armored car units fighting in Libya are divided into two major parts: one is a very fast-moving independent unit, and the other is an army tank brigade, which is more heavily armored and moves more slowly, and must be coordinated with infantry during combat. Based on the experience of fighting in France, the fast-moving patrol tanks in the armored division should be equipped with thicker armor, and the heavy tanks that cover the infantry's advance should also increase speed, so the distinction between the two is gradually becoming difficult to distinguish.

The armored car unit initially only performed patrol work for the cavalry and provided cover for the infantry, but it has now become an independent force that can charge into battle. It can freely use agile units to rush into gaps in the enemy's front, or attack on the flanks. The battles in Libya used this tactic in conjunction.

Both infantry tanks and patrol tanks are equipped with flat-trajectory guns that fire two-pound shells (used to shoot at enemy tanks) and "Besa" machine guns, and their firepower must be strengthened in the future.

British tanks did not perform well in the French theater before. The British and French infantry tanks were also much fewer than the enemy's, but one point to note is that none of the tank armor had ever been penetrated by German shells. At one time, it was rumored on the front line that the German side had giant tanks weighing 70 to 100 tons, but they really did not have any tanks over 36 tons.

### The Black Market Price of Rice Soars Again Yesterday, Food for the People Reaches a Serious Stage, Should Be Reported According to the State Council's Regulations on Punishment, How Can the Responsible Authorities Allow Further Hesitation

Yesterday, the rice market, under the influx of abundant sources, suddenly soared again by six or seven yuan per picul in the black market, setting the highest record for rice price increases in the open market. The rice parasites are extremely rampant, making the city's food problem approach the most serious stage. If the two concession authorities do not immediately take emergency measures, the rice market in this port will become even more unimaginable. Yesterday's black market rice prices reached 3,400 yuan per hundred bags for small polished rice, 3,200 yuan for Saigon No. 1 and 2 rice, and 3,000 yuan for Siamese rice. The price of broken rice reached 90 yuan per picul, an increase of more than 20 yuan per picul in the past two weeks.

Many Ways to Implement Punishment

The main reasons for the increase are nothing more than: (1) Speculators disregard the authorities' impending implementation of punishment laws if evidence is found; (2) Rice industry associations lack the power to rectify the rice market; (3) Hoarders control spot goods; (4) Illegal elements use special forces to purchase spot goods in the market. Based on the above reasons, to suppress rice prices, officials must quickly implement the following points: (1) Immediately dispatch secret agents to investigate and arrest any suspected hoarders; (2) Order hoarders to sell spot goods to retail rice shops; (3) Strengthen the organization of rice industry associations to quickly take responsibility for clearing the rice market; (4) Strictly prohibit non-industry people from using villains to purchase spot goods in the market; (5) Public warehouse rice should pre-order with the funds already paid by various industries in advance. If there is further delay, it will be of no help; (6) The Shanghai Price Stabilization Association should immediately hold the ninth phase of price stabilization sales. The above points should be carried out by the authorities and all relevant parties without fear of difficulties to solve the food problem of the people, which has already reached a serious situation.

Abundant Rice Stocks in Warehouses

The total number of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai from foreign production areas this week reached 250,000 bags. In addition to the 135,500 bags that have already been shipped, the remaining 100,000+ bags can arrive in Shanghai this week. The total amount of rice already ordered to be shipped to Shanghai this month reaches 600,000+ bags. Combining this with the 1,019,064 bags that arrived in Shanghai in January and February, the total number of foreign rice shipped to this port this year (until the end of this month) is approximately 1,600,000+ bags. Currently, warehouses in the concession area, such as Roosevelt, Zhejiang Xingye, China, and Jiaotong, are full of rice, and the Taikoo and Gonghexiang warehouses have the most. If the authorities can effectively prevent exports and supply all of this stored rice to the city, then based only on the rice that arrived in Shanghai this year, it can supply the entire city for half a year. If we combine this with the number stored last year to supply the market, then the food situation for the people of this city will be even more abundant, and there is no fear of shortage. This shows that the current rampant market prices are entirely created by a group of rice brokers and speculators.

Concession Authorities Have the Right to Report

The National Government has previously ordered all provincial, municipal, and county governments to promulgate regulations and deal with those who hoard essential daily necessities during extraordinary periods according to law, and the industry association should bear the responsibility of correcting this. That is, merchants engaged in this industry must first register the maximum amount of goods imported with the industry association. The industry association should report the registration reports of its members monthly to the competent authorities for verification. The industry association should bear the responsibility of correcting and reporting the hoarding, black market trading, and speculative transactions of its members or non-members. If these measures are not implemented or there is cover-up behavior, the competent authorities should punish them according to law. In addition to confiscating the hoarded goods, the competent authorities may report to the local court, that is, half of the proceeds from the confiscated goods will be used for the industry's price stabilization, and half will be used as bonuses for the parties involved. Although the environment in this city is special, the concession authorities have the power to deal with such events. Therefore, all sectors of the city can use the above measures as a reference, or even adopt them, as a radical solution, and the food problem of the people at this serious peak may have hope of being suppressed.

Experts Advocate Price Controls

According to a certain national defense trade expert who spoke to reporters, during wartime, all countries in the world have laws to control prices. We hope that the concession authorities will take both temporary and permanent measures to relieve the citizens from their suffering. Regarding temporary measures, hoarders should be ordered to release goods, and the selling price should be based on the cost of the goods and legal profits, and should not be raised for speculative purposes. Otherwise, they will be confiscated and nationalized. (2) Permanent measures: the concession authorities should actively dredge domestic and foreign sources. The reason why general unscrupulous merchants hoard is nothing more than an excuse for the lack of ships and the relationship between Vietnamese rice exports to Japan. The concession authorities should consult with shipping companies and transport food and fuel as much as possible, and postpone the transportation of all unnecessary goods. The French Concession authorities should contact the Vietnamese authorities to allow Saigon No. 1 and 2 rice to be freely transported to Shanghai, and negotiate to rent special ships to transport them in order to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai. The French Concession has huge French interests in China and is responsible for maintaining治安, so it must actively find ways to dredge sources. In addition, encouraging group rice purchases is also an important plan. It is best for officials and merchants to cooperate to avoid the drawbacks of exploitation and embezzlement.

### Daylight Saving Time: Difficult for the Post Office to Implement, Many Parties Express Dissatisfaction

The Daylight Saving Time movement will continue to be promoted by the municipal authorities this year. According to a Datong News Agency reporter who inquired with the Shanghai Postal Administration, the bureau must coordinate with the time for sealing and sending mailbags in various places, making implementation difficult. Even when the Daylight Saving Time movement was implemented for the first time in this port more than ten years ago, the clock on the Sichuan Road Bridge Post Office Building was not moved forward, and the same was true last year. Therefore, this year, in addition to the staff in the various sections on the third floor who can implement it, the business office on the second floor will generally still work according to the usual hours.

Very Little Electricity Saved

The English "Great America Evening News" stated that a certain member of the Shanghai Power Company recently stated that the time of Daylight Saving Time can only save 5% of the electricity consumption of households. This accounts for a very small part of the total consumption, so the Daylight Saving Time, which is scheduled to be implemented from midnight on Saturday, will be of little help in solving the coal shortage problem currently encountered by the power company.

Many Obstacles

A reader of this newspaper, Mr. Zhang Yizhang, wrote a letter stating that the matter of "moving the clock forward" easily causes various disputes in all public laws and private articles related to time, and the promotion is difficult to generalize. If two time systems are used at the same time, there will be even more misunderstandings. Moreover, the Chinese government does not want to allow two time systems to be used within one country. For the above reasons, "moving the clock forward" is not desirable. Zhang Yizhang, night of March 12th.

### "Special Police" to Begin Work Tomorrow

"Deputy Director of Special Police" Krysha told reporters yesterday that the rumor that "Special Police" would hold an "Opening Ceremony" on the morning of the 14th is, from his perspective, a "news story." He also said that the "new police" will only exercise "duties" in the area tomorrow morning (the 15th). The new "uniforms" of the "Special Police" will be issued this afternoon. Krysha also stated that the roster of foreign personnel in the "Special Police" will soon be submitted to Chen Gongbo for "approval."

### Baker to Preside Over the Yunnan-Burma Road, All Parties Deeply Rejoice at Getting the Right Person, Managing Everything with a Super-Party Figure is Truly the Best Way to Increase Efficiency

The English "Great America Evening News" stated that all those who understand the difficulties of China's war prospects and are not blinded by overly optimistic propaganda should celebrate the appointment of Dr. Baker as the Director-General of the Yunnan-Burma Road Committee. The authorities' selection of a friend who sympathizes with China and is in a super-party position is truly the best way to increase the efficiency of the road. It is undoubtedly clear that the Yunnan-Burma Road is the lifeline of China's transportation line, and the level of its transportation efficiency depends on whether the management is effective. Baker is a friend of China and is very familiar with the situation in China, and is truly the most suitable candidate for this important task.

The Transportation Mechanism Can Be Sound

The goods traveling on the Yunnan-Burma Road are extremely congested, but objective observers mostly believe that the road's transportation mechanism is not very sound. For example, on the trucks traveling to and fro, many are used to modify private goods in the status of public goods. Although a small number of private individuals profit, the public sector suffers losses. Also, gasoline is consumed on journeys unrelated to the war. All of this is due to poor management, otherwise China should save a lot of money.

Office Efficiency Will Increase Further

A large number of people on the road are enthusiastic about handling affairs and strive to improve the road's maximum efficiency, but another group of people put their own private interests first, thus harming the public interest of the country. From now on, with Dr. Baker in charge of management, this group of people who do not know the meaning of war can disappear from the road.

### The Industry Hopes That the Authorities Will Fairly Distribute Electricity, Because Temporary Measures Favor the Japanese Side, and Great Impact If Not Resolved Reasonably

People in the Shanghai industrial sector have high expectations for the committee organized by the Public Works Department to study the problem of electricity supply distribution, hoping that the committee can formulate some fair electricity distribution measures to replace the Public Works Department's electricity reduction measures. Their opinions can be summarized into the following three points: (1) If the temporary electricity reduction measures formulated by the Public Works Department based on past electricity consumption are actually implemented, then factories other than Japanese manufacturers will suffer; (2) The key to solving the Shanghai electricity supply problem is in the hands of the Japanese, because if the Japanese authorities can increase the measures for transporting North China coal to Shanghai, the electricity supply problem can be solved; (3) It is not difficult for factories to reduce electricity consumption by 20% to 25%, but after this measure is implemented, not only will the industrial sector suffer, but also millions of people in the city who directly and indirectly rely on it for a living will be affected.

Limited Electricity Supply for Industrial Use

It is heard that the first task of the newly formed committee of the Public Works Department is to formulate several "general regulations" regarding the priority of electricity supply, and to suggest to the power company and the Public Works Department the amount of electricity that should be supplied to various industrial institutions. The new committee has recently held several preparatory meetings and officially gathered yesterday (the 13th). The current shortage of electricity in the city is due to the fact that the Shanghai Power Company cannot purchase and transport the necessary amount of coal and oil to supply to the power plants.

Power Generation Fuel Cannot Be Replenished

It is reported that the Shanghai Power Company can now only protect half of the coal and oil needed for an average amount. The coal and oil yards of the power company currently only have coal and oil for three months of normal supply. After this batch of inventory is used up, the power company has no hope of immediately obtaining a large amount of fuel to replenish it. It is heard that the only way to remedy the current situation is for the Japanese authorities to give full cooperation to the Shanghai Power Company and the Public Works Department and release the coal under their control for shipment.

Japanese Factories Use Nearly Half of the Electricity

Before the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Shanghai Power Company used coal almost entirely supplied by the Kailuan Coal Mine in North China, but now this source has been sharply reduced. Currently, the Japanese-owned factories in this city consume the most electricity, accounting for half of the industrial electricity issued by the power company every day. If there is no immediate and effective measure to save the current situation within a month, Shanghai will encounter the first-ever restriction on electricity use, and the electricity supplied to factories will gradually be reduced.

Serious Consequences Are Hard to Avoid

If this happens, two serious consequences will occur: (1) Production will decrease, causing Shanghai's exports to decline; (2) The number of employed workers will be reduced proportionally, increasing the suffering of the already severely burdened wage earners. In addition, the living habits of many citizens of Shanghai may have to change, because the electricity consumption of entertainment venues such as nightclubs and theaters, and even the electricity for electric signs and store windows, will be reduced.

Thorough Research into the Investigation and Distribution

The Public Works Department has already announced that it will implement Daylight Saving Time at the end of this week, and it is heard that the reason for the early implementation is to help save electricity. At the same time, although the electricity shortage problem is quite urgent, the discussion of solutions is still in the research and investigation stage. The establishment of the new committee aims to conduct a more thorough study of the distribution of electricity in conjunction with the Shanghai Power Company.

Many Applications to Increase Electricity

According to news from the previous day, after the news that the electricity supply may be reduced came out, various factories have applied to the power company to increase the supply of electricity. These applications will be studied by the above-mentioned expert committee. It is found that the committee has just been established and has not yet made any recommendations.

Principles Have Been Set to Limit Demand

However, it is heard that when the committee studies future electricity demand, it will pay attention to the following points: (1) Restrictions on electricity supply should not affect the implementation of law and order in Shanghai, which means that electricity for street lights and public safety equipment should not be restricted; (2) Restrictions on electricity supply should not affect the maintenance of public health, which means that electricity for hospitals and institutions related to public health should not be restricted; (3) Restrictions on electricity supply should, to the greatest extent possible, have the least impact on Shanghai's export manufacturers and large employers of labor.

### The Japanese Remain Silent on the Public Works Department Elections, The British Have Held Several Meetings

The Japanese "Daily News" stated that the Public Works Department elections in the Public Concession have been scheduled for the 23rd of next month. As in previous years before the elections, the British, American, and Japanese sides had launched an election battle 20 days before the election period. This year, after the election date was decided, the American side immediately convened an emergency cadre meeting and recommended Arlo Mann and Ming Side as candidates, while the British and Japanese sides have not expressed anything and remain silent. Recently, the British expatriate side, with Ambassador Cole's arrival in Shanghai as the center, has held several meetings, and there seems to be an internal decision to recommend the current directors to continue as candidates, while the Japanese side has not moved. Various Western newspapers have made various reports on the Japanese side's intentions, wanting to find out the Japanese side's concrete plan, but the Japanese side is still silent, so the Japanese side's future movements are attracting much attention.

### 8,000+ Tons of Hongji Coal

Coal prices continue to increase, and it is heard that yesterday they rose again by 10 yuan per ton. However, according to those familiar with the matter, what is lacking in coal in this city is the Indian coal used by the power company, and there is no shortage of coal for briquettes, Hongji coal dust, and coal from Qinhuangdao. The Taikoo Ninghai ship often travels between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, loading coal to Shanghai. The Kailuan company's coal ships have also never been interrupted. Hongji coal often comes to Shanghai. It is now learned that the Panama ship Ramona, managed by Tongcheng Company, and the Kaili ship of Hualun Foreign Company, both loaded with 8,900 tons of coal from Hongji, can arrive in port this afternoon. The two ships are scheduled to berth at pontoons 20, 21, and 22, and unload and transfer. It can be seen that there is no shortage of coal in this city either. It is all the coal merchants taking the opportunity to raise prices, citing increased freight costs and shortages in the source of supply.

### First Anniversary of the Death of Tianxu Wosheng

Yesterday was the first anniversary of the death of the writer and industrialist Chen Xuyuan, Tianxu Wosheng. All the employees of the family industrial company founded by Chen held a first anniversary memorial meeting at the company's main factory square. The ceremony was grand. A plaque with the four characters "Parents of Food and Clothing" was hung on the chairman's platform, and the thickness of Chen's treatment of people and the depth of the employees' love and support can be seen. After the ceremony, Chen Xiaodie, the son, gave a reply, stating that after the 813 Incident, his late father established branch factories for the company in order to supply production and sales in various places. Regardless of all dangers, he and Xiaodie traveled to Han, Dian, Yu, Rong and other places, and arranged branch factories under the bombing of airplanes. After more than a year of hardship, he returned to Shanghai and soon fell ill and died. This was no doubt due to accumulated overwork. This year, unfortunately, Mr. Xu Xiaochao, who was in charge of the publishing house, also passed away due to illness. Among those responsible for the company, only Mr. Li Xinfu remains like a solitary fruit. At this time of extremely high living costs, I deeply hope that all the employees of the company will unite and work together to maintain the hard work of those in charge, and strive to lead spiritually with the spirit of Mr. Shen Xuyuan and guide materially with Mr. Xinfu, expand business, economize on material resources, and then the lives of colleagues can cope with the high tide of social economy and stand undefeated.

### The Philanthropic Society Extends Rice Distribution for One Month

It has recently come to light that the Shanghai Philanthropic Society, in view of the rising rice prices and the inability of the impoverished to afford cooking, has decided through a board resolution to extend the rice distribution with tickets after the Spring Festival until May 15th of the national calendar. This will provide relief to the poor and starving. It is deeply hoped that all sectors will participate in this benevolent act, generously donate, and create immeasurable blessings.

### Shanghai Commemorates the Recovery; All Sectors Prepare for Celebrations; Recalling the Glorious and Great Historical Achievements; Emulating the Spirit of Perseverance and Struggle

March 20th is the anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's recovery of Shanghai. All sectors in the city, to recall the glorious and great historical achievements and emulate the spirit of perseverance and struggle, have decided to solemnly celebrate this day in accordance with the National Government's regulations for commemorating revolutionary festivals during extraordinary times. However, given the unique environment of Shanghai, it has been decided not to hold any ceremonies, but to uphold the established national policy with unwavering determination, thereby completing the great task of resistance and national construction. The police authorities of the two settlements, to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking advantage of this commemorative festival to engage in illegal activities within the settlements, have decided to implement precautionary measures for one week before and after the commemorative day, prohibiting all illegal gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities, and strictly enforcing curfew laws.

### Overseas Chinese in the Americas Enthusiastically Donate to the Motherland; Donations Reach US$15 Million; United and Highly Organized

Regarding the enthusiastic donations of overseas Chinese in the Americas to the motherland, according to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who recently returned to Shanghai from America on the President Pierce, after the outbreak of the "July 7th" Incident and the national mobilization for war, overseas Chinese in the Americas successively established national salvation associations and made donations to support the war effort with great enthusiasm, which was unprecedented in previous donation campaigns. It is estimated that the total number of overseas Chinese residing in North, Central, and South America, including those born there, is 225,000. Since the beginning of the war, the total amount of donations has reached US$15 million. Taking the United States as an example, the number of overseas Chinese, men, women, old, and young, is less than 80,000. For the past three and a half years,

Everyone Has Donated Monthly

Statistics show that various donations have exceeded US$10 million. If we exclude women, children, the elderly, and the unemployed who are unable to donate, there are approximately 40,000 people who are capable of donating. Therefore, the average donation per person is US$250. These are all hard-earned money from the toiling of ordinary overseas Chinese, and they are donating by saving on food and clothing. All adult overseas Chinese in various places are required to donate monthly, with varying amounts set by the local national salvation associations. Generally, each person is required to donate US$5 per month. Those with better financial situations donate according to their ability. For those who are unable to donate, there is a donation assessment committee to determine the amount to be donated so that they can donate accordingly. Those who are poor and sick and unable to donate are allowed exemptions. It can be said that everyone is contributing financially.

Overseas Chinese Unite to Manage Donations

Since the beginning of the war, there has been a good phenomenon among overseas Chinese in the Americas, that is, all overseas Chinese are united, regardless of party affiliation, and have jointly organized a unified national salvation association to manage all financial donations and aid to the war effort. The good results achieved in donations and the smooth progress of work are due to this important reason. Recently, the Central Government specially sent Commissioner Chen Qingyun to the United States to promote a donation campaign among overseas Chinese in America, with the goal of US$6 million. Half of this amount has already been donated and is still in progress. The "One Bowl of Rice Movement" has also raised more than US$100,000, which is far from the target of US$300,000 and is being actively promoted. It is expected that the outcome will exceed US$300,000.

Hope for Sincere Unity in the Motherland

All overseas Chinese in America believe that in this war, all Chinese people must cooperate sincerely, unify their will, and make their greatest efforts to contribute to the country. They must not act independently or evade responsibility. Since the war, the motherland has continuously achieved victories, and its international status has improved compared to before. Foreigners' perceptions of overseas Chinese have changed. Now that victory is in sight, the only hope of overseas Chinese is to maintain unity, persevere to the end, and continue to donate as long as the motherland continues to fight. The current international situation continues to improve for us, and the US aid policy towards China is becoming more active. This is indeed a welcome phenomenon, but in fact, our country's efforts towards the United States are still insufficient.

The Strength of Overseas Chinese in US Aid

This can be seen from the propaganda. Newsreels of Britain's war against Germany fill American cinemas, newspapers, and magazines every day, while Chinese war newsreels are rarely seen. Our country's struggle for national liberation relies on the support of friendly countries such as the United States, but it must adhere to the policy of self-reliance and make good use of it. Do not blindly believe in others, lest others' policies change one day and lead to mistakes. One more thing to comfort compatriots in the country is that the United States recently passed the Lend-Lease Act, originally intended to aid Britain. Our compatriots ran around and appealed, explaining to the American senators and representatives they knew and requesting the same consideration for China. They finally gained sympathy. This is truly a success of national diplomacy.

Overseas Chinese Leaders Return to China for Inspection

He finally said that Mr. Bing Shun, a member of the National Political Council, is a leader of overseas Chinese in the Americas. He returned to China on the 23rd of last month. Mr. Kuang, after returning to his homeland, will not only participate in the Political Council, but also represent the "United Patriotic Donation and National Salvation Association of Overseas Chinese in America" to pay his respects to Chairman Lin and Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek, reporting on the actual situation of overseas Chinese in America donating to the country for several years. He will also express to the government authorities the overseas Chinese's concern for the unity of the motherland. Once matters in Chongqing are completed, he will travel to the front and rear areas to inspect and study emerging construction projects, in order to report the spirit of the army and people of the motherland and the possibility of investment in the mainland to overseas Chinese, thereby encouraging each other. According to the overseas Chinese, he comes from San Francisco and is very active in overseas Chinese organizations. After completing his public and private affairs in Shanghai, he will depart for Hong Kong, and may return to the United States with Mr. Kuang at the same time.

### Asia and Other Companies Will Not Close Down

Regarding the current rumors circulating outside that Asia, Mobil, Texaco, and other three gasoline companies are about to close down due to the tense situation and transportation difficulties, a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency yesterday interviewed the authorities of these three major companies to inquire about this news. They unanimously denied it and said that the current transportation situation can still maintain the minimum needs and will not cause problems. According to the above news, it has caused quite a lot of concern in the society yesterday, especially among car dealers and general oil merchants. However, according to the kerosene industry, the kerosene reserves in the city are very sufficient and can definitely maintain three months of consumption, and the source of kerosene is still not cut off.

### Beggar Shelter is Full; 85 Bailed Out; 72 Died from Illness

Since the police have been sending beggars from the streets to the Beggar Shelter, it has now stopped accepting them. The total number of beggars in the shelter is 1,429, including 905 male beggars, 273 female beggars, 197 male child beggars, and 54 female child beggars. The shelter was originally scheduled to accommodate 1,500 people, but due to insufficient cotton quilts and beds, it had to temporarily stop accepting guests. Since the start of the shelter, 85 beggars have been bailed out by relatives and friends, and 72 have died from illness.

### Hong Kong Post Office Issues Centenary Commemorative Stamps; Sales Began on February 27th

According to news from the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday, the Hong Kong Post Office issued "Hong Kong Centenary Commemorative Stamps" on February 27th. The purchasers were very crowded. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, the types issued are as follows: (1) 2 cents, (2) 4 cents, (3) 5 cents, (4) 15 cents, (5) 25 cents, (6) 1 dollar. The number of types issued is rare, that is, 1 million of the 2 cents, 1 million of the 4 cents, 4.8 million of the 5 cents, 1.6 million of the 15 cents, 720,000 of the 25 cents, and 480,000 of the 1 dollar.

### On Montage Photography (Continued)

— Lang Jingshan

In the arrangement of scenery for montage photography, the foreground must be clear, and the background need not be very clear, but it should not be too blurred. Although there are differences in distance, it should be based on what the human eye perceives. For example, the human eye sees objects within a few feet and objects within dozens of feet with the same clarity, but the camera lens is not the same. However, montage photography is a picture modified by our artistic conception, so it does not need to follow the laws of mechanics. It only needs to conform to the impression obtained by human vision. For example, Chinese painting is also based on the impression obtained by human vision as the rule, and it does not deviate from nature. Therefore, its scenery is equally clear in the distance and near, but it is distinguished by complexity, density, and lightness. Montage photography can also be done according to this principle, and it does not need to be limited by the mechanical form. As for the scenery that is too far away and beyond the clear line of sight of the human eye, it should be blurred, just like the distant mountains in Chinese painting, only lightly brushed, and there is also the so-called, "distant water has no waves, distant people have no eyes, distant trees have no branches." In short, observing nature with the human eye, if it is done according to what the human eye perceives, is also the law of nature.

The joining of two negatives should be smooth throughout, appearing natural and without traces of piecing together. If the joining part is a straight edge, it must be made into a slope or a wavy curve, so that the joining part is easily integrated. If the joining part can be folded and joined, embedding the whitest part of one end of this piece into the shadow of the other piece, then the scenery is intertwined, without revealing any traces of artificiality, and naturally seamless. The scenery at the joining of two negatives, such as misty clouds, lush grass, or rippling blue waves, is the best material for joining. It is not only easy to connect, but also can make the realm deep and the mood vivid.

The technique of joining two scenes can also use a soft-focus lens, slightly blurring the projection, so that the colors are more harmonious. Other methods, such as using a halftone screen to overlay, can also remedy the traces of joining the two scenes, often achieving good success.

There are two methods for joining two scenes: one is the red coating method, and the other is the masking method. If only the lower end of the scene in one piece is taken, then the upper end is coated with a red pen. If only a part of it is taken, then the unnecessary part is coated. This is the so-called red coating method. However, once the negative has been coated with red, the red coated part cannot be used. If you want to keep the entire negative for other uses, you can use the masking method. The method is to suspend a piece of glass in the air between the lens of the projector and the bromide paper to be projected. The unnecessary part of the glass is covered with black paper to block the light, so the shadow of this part does not reach the bromide paper. This negative can be used for other applications.

For the projection of joining multiple negatives, because of their different thicknesses, the exposure time cannot be the same. Even if the thicknesses of each negative are the same, if you need to change the density of the printed positive film, the exposure time must also be changed. What should be noted is that the exposure time can be different, but the development time cannot be different, because multiple negatives are projected on one sheet of bromide paper, and it is not easy to develop separately. Therefore, the thickness and color strength of the negatives must be tested and standardized, and noted in the order of A, B, C, and D, so that they can be handled easily during projection.

When making montage photos, it is best to start with simple scenes. When you have more experience and skilled techniques, you can gradually progress to complex ones. As for making a perfect and seamless montage photo, it is not easy. It takes a lot of effort in material selection, composition, and projection. If you get a perfect one, you can reproduce a negative or print it on bromide paper as a paper negative, and you can add retouching, which is easy to preserve and can get a large number of reproductions. Although the success of making montage photos depends on the technique of projection, the composition and design in peacetime are also very important. The author must often review all the negatives in detail, which ones should be joined with which ones, and carefully manage them to avoid any flaws. From time to time, classify them and make sketches, using ingenuity to add, subtract, and improve them to achieve the best possible picture, so that there is no omission or confusion during projection, and there is a wonderful natural composition.

### Case of the Kidnapping of Bei Runsheng and His Son; More Important Criminals Captured; A Total of 20 Criminals Captured in Various Hotels, Etc.; Another Hostage, Yao Dexing, Rescued

Bei Runsheng, a wealthy dye merchant residing at No. 170 Nanyang Road, and his son Yikun were twice kidnapped unsuccessfully on January 15th and the 2nd of this month.

Commercial News

### Grain: Nearly 200,000 Bags of Imported Rice Arrive in Shanghai; The Price Differential Reaches 3,400 Yuan; Must the Price Limit Be Broken by Dozens of Yuan Before Re-evaluation? Must the Hoarders Make a Fortune Before Crackdown? Must the Hoarded Rice Be Arranged Before Investigation?

The imported rice market was even more chaotic yesterday, and general speculators were more active. They are only afraid of a clear market and cannot stir up trouble in troubled waters. Although a large amount of newly arrived and stockpiled imported rice could not suppress the market, foreign firms cited a lack of ships for orders as a pretext to raise prices, and added increased freight costs, even fabricating reasons. Brokers speculated that Matsuoka's trip to Europe meant that the Soviet Union would compromise with Japan, and a southward advance could be realized, encouraging the market. Rice hoarders have always hoped that something would happen in Nanyang, so that the source of imported rice would be cut off, making a large fortune of incalculable amounts. Therefore, at the opening yesterday, hoarders took control, resulting in a prairie fire that was unstoppable. The off-market price of imported rice increased more and more fiercely. All hoarders wanted to let go and then capture, opening their mouths like lions and carrying out a scheme of devouring, creating a pyramid that rose endlessly. Scattered hoarders followed suit, eating their leftovers and taking pleasure in it. The premium per 100 bags increased to as much as 500 or 600 yuan. General stores had to endure this in order to cope with urgent retail needs. On the other hand, there was no way to deal with the rice market. No re-evaluation was considered until the price limit was broken by dozens of yuan, no crackdown was carried out until the hoarders had made a fortune, and no investigation was conducted until the hoarded rice was arranged. Therefore, hoarders hoarded as much as possible and manipulated the market, turning a blind eye and a deaf ear. Their desires became more intense, their courage grew, and their hearts became blacker. The more they did, the more they did. This is why the premium yesterday reached an unprecedented high price. The premium for each 100 bags of Xiaojiao Yinghua Si original package increased from 3,000 yuan to 3,400 yuan. The premium for each 100 original bags of Saigon No. 1 and 2 increased from 2,800 yuan to 3,200 yuan. Xiaojiao 3,100 yuan. Broken rice has already paid a premium of 1,600 or 700 yuan per 100 bags. Those who weigh enough and deliver 160 catties are priced at 90 yuan and 89 yuan, even though the price of broken rice is still higher than that of good rice. No wonder the good rice is even more hoarded. The total transaction volume exceeded 20,000 bags due to the greed of both buyers and hoarders. Imported yuan rice was also favored by hoarders, because there was no price, which could avoid accusations and illegal fraud. The price also rose sharply by three or four yuan. Hong Kong yuan has opened to 155 yuan.

The market price of imported rice continues to rise, and the source is a large number of connections. More than 153,000 bags have arrived this week. The French company's Bernardin de Saint Pierre mail ship arrived yesterday afternoon with more than 37,000 bags of imported rice from Saigon, as well as more than 3,000 bags of corn, and berthed at the Suntay Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. The Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with 3,561 bags from Hong Kong and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It was found that the total amount of imported rice arriving in Shanghai this week, including yesterday, was 193,500 bags. (Zu)

Due to the rising prices of thick and thin japonica rice and other national rice, the merchants are scrambling for it, and the accumulated amount after a market shutdown is more than before. On the sales side, the price is expensive and the intention is weak, so the goods are inferior. Therefore, the shout of the cargo owner is flat, and the market has not changed. Kunshan sees white japonica rice still priced at 181-2 yuan, original package 186 yuan. Changbang sees high japonica rice priced at 184-5 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice priced at 188-9 yuan, original package 182 yuan.

The sporadic appetite of glutinous rice rice porters and cake shops is better, while large households continue to absorb it. There is not much goods in the market, and it is heard that the off-market of imported rice continues to surge, and the cargo owners' intention to sell is firm and high, hoarding and playing tricks. The market price rose by two or three yuan again, opening Hong Kong white yuan high from 155 yuan, and deciding to sell for 180 yuan.

### More Than 40,000 Bags of Flour Arrive; Hoarders Don't Think It's Too Much

A large number of foreign flour has arrived in Shanghai in succession. The Jardine Matheson Hesheng ship transported 50,000 bags from Hong Kong the other day, which has been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the Dingsheng ship, which arrived yesterday, in addition to more than 3,000 bags of foreign rice transported from Hong Kong, also had 44,410 bags of flour, which docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. Due to the rain yesterday, the unloading is scheduled to start today.

(Zu)

The market for foreign flour has stopped trading, but off-market trading continues unabated. The rice market has continued to rise, and people's hearts have remained high. The Zhonglou brand Australian flour has risen to 32 yuan again, and the Jinlong spleen flour has risen to about 31 yuan. However, flour transshipped from Hong Kong is gradually being shipped to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Hanyang ship newly arrived with 50,000 bags, which are being unloaded. At present, the foreign wheat arriving at the Huachang Factory can produce 200,000 to 300,000 bags of flour, and in addition to the foreign flour orders, they are arriving one after another. Benjie's flat-selling flour is still supplied by the Fuxin Factory with more than 5,000 bags, priced at 25 yuan, and distributed to designated merchants to purchase.

Wheat is as silent as ever. The source in the mainland has been cut off for a long time, and the market has lacked supply. Both the Japanese and Chinese factories have no goods to buy. The market is lacking.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Cake and Corn Become Objects of Speculation in Grains; Shocking Rise in Prices

Yesterday, the oil market rose first and then fell, and soybeans were flat, but bean cake and corn rose sharply. Because futures trading in bean cake was banned, speculators inside and outside the industry swarmed to spot cake for activity. This was because the price of cake was still relatively cheap compared to fertilizer, so the scope of hoarders expanded. Under the situation of raising prices here and pulling them there, more than 30,000 pieces of various brands of cake were traded at a rise of one yuan, three or four cents. As for corn, because of the large sales markets everywhere and the lack of restrictions on the source of goods, the market became wide and turbulent, resulting in a rise of about three yuan in the spot price and an increase of four or five yuan in the futures price.

Today, 500 cans of raw oil came from Qingdao to the export sector. On the 14th, 250 bags of beans, 8,350 pieces of bean cake, and 300 cans of sesame oil were all shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Increased Demand for US Dollars in the Near Future

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices for various currencies remained flat, the black market rate for British currency slightly softened, and the US dollar rate first loosened and then tightened. This was because Hong Kong Electric and other companies came out in force after the market opened in the morning, causing the March US dollar to reach 5.53125 yuan, which was difficult to continue selling. At that time, the Bank of China had a slight appetite, and the situation tended to be stagnant for a long time. Until 11:40, it was suddenly heard that HSBC's small counter had imported US dollars with a price reduction of 0.0625, quoted at 5.4375 yuan. A certain foreign bank had a slight appetite, so it saw a pullback. Futures for April had already seen a squeeze. In the afternoon, Chinese speculators collectively worked to buy up US dollars, reaching more than 200,000 yuan, causing the current month's US dollar to break through the 5.5 yuan level again. Fortunately, a certain US bank supplied the market, and the price soon stabilized, finally settling at 5.46875 yuan, tightened by 0.02125. The British currency also softened by 0.015625, to 3 shillings 3.59375 pence. Trading was quite active. It was heard that a certain importer had bought up a considerable amount of US dollars.

Hong Kong Side Sells Off Early in the Morning

At the beginning of the morning, London's long-term and short-term silver prices both rose by 0.0825, New York's silver price remained flat, London's raw gold was stagnant, and the exchange rates for British currency against US currency, Shanghai currency, etc. moved slightly. The US currency against British currency, Shanghai currency, etc. also sought change. There were no transactions for French currency. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling price was 3 shillings 3.75 pence for British currency and 5.5 yuan for US dollars, which was quite stable. Shortly after opening, Hong Kong Electric sold off US dollars, and Chinese and foreign banks' appetite for buying was relatively stagnant, and the market immediately hardened. It was estimated that the March US dollar was trading at 5.53125 yuan. Afterwards, speculators once came out to buy British currency and sell US dollars, which was estimated to be 3.9125 yuan for both supply and acceptance of spot currency and exchange. At 9:30, HSBC's listed prices were announced, and the various currencies did not move. The equalization tax increased by 0.50%. After this, people's minds tended to relax, and Chinese speculators again sold short-term and long-term US dollars. It was estimated that foreign banks received offers at a price of 5.5 yuan for the June contract, and 5.53125 yuan for the March contract. Until noon, HSBC's small counter changed the US dollar price by reducing it by 0.0625, to 5.4375 yuan, which caused a pullback. Speculators stopped selling. The result of the midday close was that the spot US dollar returned to 5.5 yuan, and the immediate delivery of British currency was 3 shillings 3.75 pence.

Demand for Futures Remains Flat

The market was very good in the latter part of the day. It was heard that speculators were vigorously buying near-term US dollars, and the amount was quite considerable. It was estimated that a certain US bank sold at a price of 5.46875 yuan for the March contract. However, the demand for futures was still flat, so it was still close to the spot price. The result of the evening close was that both spot and futures British currency closed at 3 shillings 3.59375 pence, and the US dollar closed at 5.46875 yuan, with the British currency down 0.015625 and the US dollar down 0.03125 from the previous day's closing price.

### Gold Market Wants to Recover and Rise Again Before Swap

Yesterday, the gold market was red-hot in the black market, and fluctuations arose slightly. It fell first and then rose. After breaking through the 6,300 yuan mark, it was seen to break out again. At 11:40 noon, the mood of all parties suddenly turned firm from flat and tired. This was because a certain importer bought in a large amount, causing HSBC Bank to reduce the price of imported US dollars by 0.0625. The black market also softened slightly. In addition, today's 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm is the swap date for March to April, and the seller will pay the buyer around 40 yuan. Therefore, the bill merchants sold first, pressing the price down to 6,278 yuan. Later, they also re-entered amid rumors of covering short positions, and the price immediately rebounded. In the afternoon, silver houses and money shops also entered, raising the price to 6,350 yuan. Soon, the US dollar stopped tightening, and the price also turned down and stabilized. The market closed with another rise of 30 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was about 20,000 taels. Cash transactions were quite active.

Later, Defu offered 400 taels, Bei Qingyun offered 60 taels, and Shihe offered 70 taels, all at 420 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Wanfeng offered Chengji 50 taels, still at 420 yuan higher. Gold ornaments, customs gold, etc. remained at the original price.

Red-Hot Rise for Three Consecutive Days

At the beginning of the morning, the market was calm and there was a lack of transactions on the table, so the opening price was quite easy to approach, and it was opened at the previous day's closing price, still at 6,300 yuan. After the opening, under the pressure of Tiancheng, Defu, and other firms, it slowly wanted to rise, but only increased by eight yuan, and it was seen at 6,308 yuan. When foreign exchange opened, the appetite of Chinese and foreign banks was thin, and the potential for reporting long positions was strong, and the selling wind became prevalent. With Dafeng, Chengji, and Yida as leaders, they continuously sold off. Although there were occasional buyers, the supply and demand ultimately felt uneven, and the market revolved downward, falling to a minimum of 6,278 yuan. Later, the price suddenly went up because HSBC's small counter reduced the price of imported US dollars by 0.0625, to 5.4375 yuan, which slightly affected operators, who stopped selling and turned to buying. Shihe, Yida, and Dafeng vigorously entered the market, gradually pushing the price to outside 6,300 yuan, reaching 6,320 yuan. Until the midday close, it was still at 6,315 yuan, which was very expensive after the close. It was heard that 6,330 yuan had already been traded. The market opened at 6,330 yuan in the afternoon, and after a short while, Hengji and Shunyuan came to buy one after another, rising another 20 yuan, reaching a peak of 6,350 yuan. This was because the foreign exchange rate was reduced. Later, Dafeng, Chengji, and others saw the price rise and sold, pressing it down to 6,325 yuan together. The evening close was 6,330 yuan, a rise of 30 yuan from the previous day. It has been rising for three consecutive days, with a total increase of 90 yuan. According to the closing price of the March US dollar at 5.46875 yuan, it was 6,368 yuan, a decrease of 38 yuan. The total fluctuation for the day was 72 yuan. The selling price of the cash houses' own brand of gold was 430 to 440 yuan higher than the red-hot (futures) price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There is still no market for the current standard gold.

Ornaments Still Unmoved

The selling price of gold ornaments in silver shops has not changed, with Datong Hang suspending at 690 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang similar to the above price, with the buying price 40 yuan lower.

### US Dollar Gradually Rises to 18 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market: Although the red-hot market price rose, the cash price tended to soften, so British and American gold pounds finally stabilized, and British gold notes remained stagnant as before. The market price stood flat. The US dollar note initially retreated to 17.92 yuan, and then gradually rose, rising to 18.1 yuan in the evening, a rise of eight cents from the previous day. Hong Kong notes tended to be slightly firm. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes were rarely changed, with the former still at 1.89 yuan and the latter still at 1.57 yuan.

### Securities: Government Bonds Black Market Slightly Weak; Foreign Firms Distribute Shares in Three Cases

Yesterday, the black market for government bonds gradually weakened. The selling pressure in the market was heavier. It rose several times, but was finally suppressed. The multiple parties felt oppressed and temporarily succumbed. In the afternoon, there were unverifiable rumors, and the market started to shake. Xinfu's bulls released more than one million, but the appetite of the buyers was also quite healthy. If Xinfu had not sold, it would not have been easy to fall, even with rumors, because the buyers were all powerful. The market opened very firm yesterday morning, and Class C bonds entered the 7 yuan mark several times. The midday close still stood outside 7 yuan. Shunchang bought in the most, and Yitai Jiu was also not weak. Xie Kang and Hongda sold the most, and Hengfu decided. In the afternoon, Xinfu's bulls released their ability one after another, selling more and more. Dingkang Lianhe also sold quite a bit. At that time, Xie Da, Shunchang, Renfeng, and Renchang all bought in unison. Their backgrounds were all in the financial sector, and the money was all from the same source, so the market price did not fall. Then, rumors suddenly arose, and Runde, Xiexing, Wu Xinhua, Hefeng, and Yifeng sold, and the market price began to decline. However, the market was slightly pulled up at the close, and the result was a unanimous decline of five to ten cents. The total transaction volume was more than 3 million yuan. The following is a brief table:

The stock exchange traded 50 shares of the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange at a price of 50.075 yuan, and the market price rose by three to four yuan from the previous day.

### Yarn and Flowers: Actual Sales Unable to Develop Slightly; Yarn Market Rises and Falls Suddenly

The yarn market continued to be firm, but the trend was volatile. This was because the will of both long and short sides was small, and major operators in the industry all adopted the principle of absorbing on dips. As for the securities gangs and other small operators, they entered and exited from time to time, so the market rose and fell suddenly. The Hong Kong gang had a special demand for 32-count single yarn. However, the upward trend of the yarn market was gradually moving towards the upper price range. The only fly in the ointment was that the actual sales had not seen a large amount of progress. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,422 yuan, and the low price was 1,389 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was 1,422 yuan, and then gradually fell to 1,404 yuan. Today, 365 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the enthusiastic mood of the afternoon of the previous day. Short positions were largely covered. The opening price was 1,420 yuan, and soon rose to 1,422 yuan. Those who made a little profit came out, and the market became loose. Suddenly, it fell to 1,401 yuan. This price revolved without falling for about an hour. It was heard that foreign exchange was quiet, and it suddenly fell into the 400 yuan mark, to 1,389 yuan. Unexpectedly, near noon, a rise in prices suddenly arose, saying that the price of gold was rising, and short positions rushed to cover their positions, rising to 1,410 yuan in an instant to close. The statistical statistics of transactions in half a day were 6,655 bales. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 255 Co-operators 6,400

Total 6,655

### Fine Velvet Raw Cotton: Especially Firm and Expensive

The current situation of cotton is slightly firm and expensive. The 42-count raw materials are very firm, all because the source of goods is difficult. As for 20-count cotton, because the price of yarn has risen recently, people are looking forward to a higher price.

In the New York cotton market, the market fell sharply at the beginning of the morning due to spot merchants buying and selling, but the market gradually stabilized again afterwards. As a result, the closing price was about two or three pounds lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was basically flat, falling first due to cotton merchants hedging sales, and then recovering due to a small number of purchases. There were no major ups and downs in the forecast yesterday.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was limited to small-scale purchases and mutual sales among operators. The market was still firm, especially the long-staple Mao Mittellin, which is used as raw material for fine velvet, was popular with all parties. It is expected that if the situation can be more favorable, there will be good development.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Changes Suddenly

The factory cloth market revolved yesterday, with a slight loosening at the opening in the morning, and a sudden tightening once in the afternoon, but then it softened again. This was because people's hearts were uneasy, and the market was easily swayed by rumors, changing suddenly. As a result, white goods and coarse cloth fell by 25 cents per piece, and fine cloth twill fell by 10 to 25 cents per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth was flat. Local hoarders watched and waited, and transactions were light, with a total of more than 200 pieces. Sales were mediocre, and new purchases by the Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs were still rare, with a total of more than 100 pieces of Shilin cloth and other goods. The Zhejiang and Fujian gangs purchased more than 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, Fugui fine cloth, and Yihua group cloth. 810 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 14th.

Yesterday, the East cloth market fell back due to scattered households being distracted and selling for profit. Fine cloth and fine twill fell by 50 to 75 cents per piece. The closing price of Longtou fine cloth for spot goods was 47.9 yuan. The futures price of the exchange for this month was 48.25 yuan, and the color goods of the Four Gentlemen fell by 0.015 yuan to 47.345 yuan.

### Coal: Large Quantities Arrive from Hongji, Prices Rise Again and Again

Today, a large quantity of coal arrived in Shanghai from Hongji. The Panama wheel Ranaona, managed by Tongcheng Company, arrived with 4,300 tons from Hongji, and the Huaren Yanghang Kaili wheel also arrived with 4,600 tons from Hongji. Both are scheduled to arrive today, and are scheduled to berth together at Yangshupu Pu Xiang floating cylinders 20, 21, and 22 for unloading and transfer.

Although the stock of Hongji white coal dross in the city has been abundant recently, operators have spread the word yesterday that the later freight will have to increase by two US dollars per ton. The dismantling of the same industry has been limited, and is only for the application of raw materials in coal ball factories. The market price continues to increase by 10 yuan, with No. 2 dross at 178 yuan per ton, and the local shop price at 9.6 yuan per burden.

### Hardware: US Tinplate Rises Again Due to Exhaustive Search

US tinplate is unusually good, because the arrival of goods from all sources has been cut off, and the search in this port is particularly frequent, and the price has risen again and again, creating a new record in tinplate. The asking price yesterday was 350 yuan per box for 180 pounds and 380 yuan per box for 200 pounds (both containing 112 sheets of 20 inches x 28 inches), a significant increase of 20 to 30 yuan each compared to the previous market.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Red Slightly Looser

The sugar market rose and fell yesterday, but it was still tightly controlled. The association divided the spot price of 24 crude white into 80.5 yuan at the outer warehouse, which rose to 0.6 yuan to 0.7 yuan, only rising by 10 cents. The March 20th delivery price was 80.9 yuan to 81 yuan, rising by 20 cents. The end-of-March delivery price was 81.2 yuan to 81.4 yuan, and then returned to 81.2 yuan, rising by 10 cents. Dutch Red was 63.5 yuan, down by 5 cents. Taikoo Che Bai B mark was 81.3 yuan for the end-of-March delivery, rising by 30 cents. The new HX mark Western warehouse was 77.5 yuan, down by 20 cents.

### Paramount Basketball Team Decides to Go South, Selects Twelve Players, Departs Shanghai on the 19th of This Month

The Paramount Basketball Team, which regained the All-Shanghai Basketball League championship, a title lost for eleven years, has recently accepted an invitation from the Hong Kong Eastern Athletic Association. They will join the Eastern's third expeditionary soccer team on a tour of various islands in Southeast Asia, including Manila and Singapore. After a week of active planning and negotiations, progress has been made. It is understood that Paramount, recognizing the importance of this matter and its relation to national honor, has been particularly concerned about talent, as their strength has diminished recently. Therefore, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, and Bao Songyuan, former Paramount players who had announced their departure last winter, enthusiastically offered their support upon hearing the news. Coincidentally, the Hua Xing Basketball Team announced its dissolution, and Li and others returned to their alma mater. Paramount's strength has been greatly enhanced by the addition of these fresh troops. At the same time, Captain Chen Xianglong received a telegram from national player Cai Yanxiong, stating that he might be able to reach Hong Kong in time to join Paramount. Therefore, Paramount telegraphed Eastern, deciding to join them on the southern expedition. The expeditionary force lineup has also been carefully considered and was officially revealed yesterday afternoon. The entire team consists of twelve players, with Gu Likang as the leader, Dong Shouchun as the manager, Chen Xianglong as the captain, and Li Zhenzhong as the vice-captain. In addition to Feng Nianhua, Zhang Shaoqing, Bao Songyuan, and Chen Xuechong, who are in Shanghai awaiting orders, Wang Hongbin in Tianjin and Ren Xiangcheng in Qingdao have been urgently telegraphed to come quickly. Xu Wenkui, who was originally accompanying the Eastern soccer team, will serve a dual role, so there is no problem. However, although there is news that Cai Yanxiong will join them in Hong Kong, it is difficult to determine whether this will happen. But the overall strength of the team is already solid enough, and even if Cai Yanxiong cannot make it, it should not have a significant impact. As for the departure date of the expeditionary force, it was also decided yesterday afternoon to depart from Shanghai on the 19th of this month on the Jardine Matheson & Co. vessel, Ming Sang. Cabin bookings are being handled by someone else, and passports are also being applied for. However, because Eastern's departure date has been set for the 15th of this month from Hong Kong, Paramount must depart by the 19th at the latest. The full list of players is as follows:

Leader: Gu Likang, Manager: Dong Shouchun, Captain: Chen Xianglong, Vice-Captain: Li Zhenzhong, Players: Feng Nianhua, Zhang Shaoqing, Bao Songyuan, Chen Xuechong, Wang Hongbin, Ren Xiangcheng, Xu Wenkui, Cai Yanxiong (Xu and Cai will join in Hong Kong)

### Shan Kun Cup Small Soccer Tournament Schedule Change This Week

### "Problem"

— Qi Shui

Undeniably, right before our eyes, the abundance of "problems" has itself become a problem!

"The people regard food as their heaven," the greatest of matters must start with filling one's stomach; it seems "rice is the basis of food," and "rice" is currently causing a "problem" - even children understand this - therefore, this "problem" should naturally be considered the "number one problem"!

So, I decided to "ask" a "gentleman" what he thought: "Yes, this 'problem'... is a 'problem.'" Afterwards, he said nothing more. I was dull and didn't understand, so I had to "ask" again; he had no choice but to say another sentence: "Hmm, this 'problem'... is indeed the 'problem' of 'problems.'" So I stopped "asking," afraid that the "problem" would be "stacked" in his mouth, anyway, he doesn't create "problems";

Some say: the solution to this "problem" lies in the "conscience problem," "money problem," and "sanction problem," "punishment problem"... of some "people."

Ultimately, when will this "problem" cease to be a "problem," in terms of "time" and "environment," that is probably still a "problem."

### Selling Dog Meat Under a Sheep's Head

— Shi Wan

I remember not long ago, a news item was published in the newspaper: "A certain meat stall in the Seymour Road vegetable market in this city was found to be selling dog meat under a sheep's head. The Municipal Council Health Department discovered this and imposed a penalty..." At the time, it really aroused a lot of interest among the leisure class, and after tea and dinner, it inevitably added a topic of conversation, mostly denouncing the great impropriety of selling "dog" meat under a "sheep" head. Moreover, the value of "dogs" in Shanghai is indeed much higher than the value of "dogs" elsewhere. From a young age, they grow up in the warm embrace of aristocratic women, eating beef, milk, and biscuits all day long. Not only that, but they also hire a "person," the spirit of all things, to serve them specially, called a dog servant. Even if their food is slightly less delicious, at least when the "dog" comes out, it must have the dignity of a silver badge hanging around its neck.

Now using "dog" meat for meals is indeed an outrageous thing, so it must be punished. Although the Health Bureau's intention is to prevent "mad dog" meat from being sold to people and causing illness. Moreover, there is no explicit regulation against eating "dog meat." In the case of sheep meat, it is indeed difficult to guarantee that there will be no "sick sheep" at all, but because it is stamped with a "inspection" mark, it belongs to the smallest number.

Originally, "selling dog meat under a sheep's head" is a well-known ancient saying in our country. If such a thing had not been discovered in the first place, this ancient saying would not have been created in the first place. This proves that this is just a re-enactment of an old play. There is no need to be surprised. The difference is that Shanghai is a place that respects "dogs," so it is not easy to catch one or two, especially "mad dogs."

A certain meat stall may have accidentally discovered a dead "dog" (of course, there is no way to know if it was mad), and had the idea of making a fortune from the national crisis. Therefore, it did not hesitate to use its own "sheep's head" sign, which had been used for many years, as a cover. Unexpectedly, before the foreign money entered the pocket, it was first punished. Compared to those philanthropists who hoard rice, selling "human" meat under a "sheep" head, sucking the blood of all Shanghai people every day, and still living a carefree life to this day, it is really extremely unlucky. We hope that the enforcers of the authorities will also follow the spirit of punishing small vendors who sell "dog" meat under a "sheep" head and relentlessly sanction unscrupulous merchants who sell "human" meat under a "sheep" head!

### The New Bronze Statue on the Huangpu River (Be Careful It Doesn't Fall!)

— Heng Zuo

### A Glimpse of the Life of a "Benefactor"

— Wang Ji San

(One)

Spring has come, everything is intoxicated.

The warm sunlight lazily shines on the towering Western-style buildings. The "ring-ring" of the telephone breaks the "benefactor's" beautiful dream inside the building. A considerable amount of annoyance is revealed on his "benevolent" face. Although the time is not early, in the "benefactor's" eyes, it is probably still late at night or early morning.

"... The ×× ship has arrived and anchored, and 50,000 shi of Saigon rice is being unloaded..." The "benefactor" smiled upon hearing this news. He laughed heartily. He looked in the mirror at his own "kind" and "benevolent" face, feeling that people calling him a "Bodhisattva" was most appropriate.

The "benefactor" took a car and rushed to the dock, seeing workers carrying bags of rice and loading them onto trucks. Outside the police cordon, people were watching:

"So much foreign rice has arrived today. Tomorrow the price of rice will fall," someone muttered to himself.

The workers were even more surprised and discussed: "Strange! Why is so much rice not going to the rice shops, but being put into warehouses?"

"The price of rice has risen by another two yuan per shi" - this was published in the newspaper the next day, and the "benefactor" smiled knowingly.

(Two)

Damn it, the "Rice Price Sanction Committee" is going to meet again. As a committee member, how can the "benefactor" be absent? Happily, he stands up and says a few "generous" words: "Everyone, the skyrocketing price of rice is ultimately not a good solution. Therefore, passively, we still need to purchase foreign rice to regulate the people's food supply; actively, we should severely sanction those black-hearted rice weevils..." As a result, he wins enthusiastic applause and praise from the entire meeting... the "benefactor" smiles triumphantly.

Walking out of the meeting, stepping into the car,

"Ah Fu, take a turn at the warehouse. The goods that were loaded last time can be 'released'."

"Sanctions" are just sanctions, "price increases" still have to increase - the Sanctions Committee is going to "meet" again, who knows!

(Three)

After the meeting, he took the opportunity to go to the charity organization to "inspect" it, and at the same time "settle" the "travel expenses" for the past two months, only nine hundred cash!

Ah, this afternoon, the "Charity Queen Contest at the ×× ballroom" is going to be held, and he has to "crown" her! Alas! Damn it! He almost forgot about this "charity event". - "Busy people have many things to do," that's right. If it weren't for these starving refugees, who would want to go to the ballroom?

(Four)

One day, the "benefactor" had a great "feeling of pity" - "Mr. ××× generously donated × hundred bags of white rice to the refugee relief association." The reason is very simple: because the "benefactor's" "good deeds" seemed to be known by some people, he had to use these few hundred shi of white rice to cover up his own "tracks," otherwise... Fortunately, the "benefactor" is not a "fool," he "knows what's up."

"Annoying"? A few hundred shi go out, and a few thousand shi are about to enter the warehouse. Out of the account, registered,... even the head is dizzy from counting. Let's put down the abacus for now, close the silver box, and go to the new wife to "have some fun"!...

### Begonia

— Qin Shou Ou

(Five) The Division Between Love and Desire

Before he could make up his mind, the sound of leather shoes echoed, and Begonia walked out as excitedly as if he had been drinking, moving his feet faster than dancing; Ji Zhaoxiong knew at a glance that his hopes would not be dashed.

"Boss Wu, congratulations, the matter has been settled! Our third wife is rarely willing to help others," Ji Zhaoxiong said in one breath, his face full of a smile that wanted money.

"Okay, okay!" Begonia also replied with a smile, but the happiness in his heart was something Ji Zhaoxiong could never have guessed, because he was not happy because Governor Hu had agreed to help.

"This matter is settled, Boss Wu, you really have to spend thousands of dollars less!" Ji Zhaoxiong kept sending Begonia to the gate, his eyes wrinkling with countless crow's feet. "Why didn't Zhao Si come with you today?"

"There are always some small things to take care of!" Begonia perfunctorily with him, and immediately wanted to get on the rickshaw.

"I'm sorry, Boss Wu!" Ji Zhaoxiong's face suddenly sank. "What did Zhao Si say yesterday?"

This was not because Begonia really wanted to go back on his word, nor was he pretending to be stupid, but because the conversation he had just had for fifty minutes had excited him too much. This kind of experience was something he had never had in his life. Even his mother, Liu Yuhua, Zhao Yukun, Yuan Shaowen, and others combined had never made him feel the kind of sweetness he had just experienced from Wei Xiangqi, so he had completely forgotten about coming to Yuan's mansion today; now Ji Zhaoxiong turned his face on him, and that's when he reminded him.

"Ah, yes!" He knew that he must not offend this servant from Yuan Bao fan's family, especially since he now had such an unspeakable hope in his heart, of course, it was even more necessary to make friends with him. He hurriedly nodded and smiled: "We must thank you heavily. How about asking you to come to our place later and talk to Zhao Si?" (54)

Entertainment World

New Movie Introduction

### "Circus Girl"

— Hu Fanfang

"Circus Girl" tells the story of a stable boy named "Que De" in a small town who joins a circus. Of course, there is also romance between men and women, but the story is very simple. Although there are many materials, it lacks a strong clue to connect them. As a result, what appears on the screen becomes piles and sections of things. The most regrettable thing is that the whole play lacks a climax that stirs the audience's emotions. Although there are a few, they are weak and powerless.

The acting skills of several actors, however, have improved this "Circus Girl": Henry Fonda plays the stable boy Que De, who is in love with the female equestrian Taoleshan Lamo in the circus, so he joins the circus in order to be close to her every day. He portrays the simple and somewhat silly personality of a country boy very delicately. Taoleshan Lamo's circus beauty is indeed very seductive. Here, we must not forget Linda Diane, she is a little girl who is just beginning to experience love. She is scolded by her father for five yuan, so she leaves home and escapes to the circus to fall in love with Henry Fonda. Diane vividly portrays the psychology of a little girl in the early stages of love, both beautiful and moving.

The most exciting scenes in the whole play are when two circuses compete in a small town, trying to attract the audience by fighting each other. The larger circus "digs out" Taoleshan Lamo with the power of money, which leads to a battle between the two groups. This scene is full of bitterness and tears in the midst of happy laughter. It is a very realistic struggle for life.

The second is when Linda Diane is pregnant and has to perform stunts on horseback. As a result, she faints on the spot, and the audience, unaware, boos her. This is also very moving. As for the last scene where Henry Fonda and Taoleshan Lamo meet in a hotel, although the tone is very seductive, it has little to do with the whole play, "I don't take it"!

This film is made in color, with gorgeous colors. If it is just for entertainment, then "Circus Girl" is still a middle-to-upper work.

### Zhang Yipeng's "New Journey to the West"

— Nan Feng

Many years ago, Ouyang Yuqian's "China Theater Troupe" performed improved Peking operas such as "The Peach Blossom Fan," which was indeed popular for a while. Although it did not achieve much success due to improper use of techniques, and did not have a widespread effect among the audience, his advocacy cannot be considered a waste. On the contrary, he made a great contribution and opened up the prospect of improving Peking opera.

The task of any drama to the audience is to educate them in entertainment, especially since Peking opera has countless petty citizens due to its long history and low level of appreciation. It is truly worthy of the compliment of "appreciated by both the elegant and the vulgar." In order to figure out how to make good use of this weapon, playwrights in the mainland have repeatedly published suggestions for improving Peking opera, which seems to be something we should be pleased about.

In Shanghai, what we see is the heartbreaking reality. Due to the lack of political ideas of the old opera performers, they pay attention to business everywhere, making it even more of a mess!

It is said that among the Peking opera actors, Zhang Yipeng is more innovative. Yesterday I went to see his "New Journey to the West" and felt that he still lacked a clear understanding of improving Peking opera. I would like to express some personal opinions based on my observations, which I think will not be superfluous.

The biggest shortcoming of "New Journey to the West" is that the whole play is full of strong low-level interests and unreasonably inserts a romance of the Dragon Girl. Although we have to take into account the objective environment, and those engaged in this cause also have their own frustrations, those beauty pageants and the like, I believe, can be omitted.

Zhang Yipeng has his hard work, such as the thirteenth group of demons wreaking havoc, the presentation of prisoners, the suffering of monkeys, and later Sun Wukong splitting the Demon King of Chaos with a knife, killing all the demons, and rescuing the monkey genus. All of these scenes have more or less new ideas, although they are not stylized, only preaching. If you are not too demanding, he has done his best. We hope that in the first episode, there will be more real facts and great achievements!

The biggest shortcoming of the old opera reflected in the present is that the entire play is made with individuals as units. For example, Zhang Yipeng's Monkey King is very famous. Since he relies on this to make money, the play focuses on him. Such as skillfully wielding double whips, Sun Wukong's martial arts, and so on, are endless. Since he has revealed the banner of improving the old opera, he should decisively change its direction. The second episode will be adapted by Mr. Wei Ruhui. I would like to offer my humble opinions for reference only.

Here, I hope that the second episode of "New Journey to the West" can have more outstanding achievements!

### Zhang Yipeng's Li Cunxiao

### The View of Life of Struggle

— Zong Yu

If you encounter failure in your struggle, you will feel that the power of fate is very great and you can no longer resist it. From then on, you let go and don't do anything. At most, you complain to express the injustice in your heart, and only blame your horoscope for being too bad. Although you have the ambition to struggle, you are overwhelmed by the fate of the thousand-pound stone and cannot lift your head.

### Blood Rain in the Qiong Garden

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter Two: The Brave Warrior of Shuofang Has Good Skills

He hurriedly jumped off the kang, took the treasure sword from the pillow, and gently opened the door. He saw a black shadow flash in the courtyard, and the black shadow had led the black horse outside the door. But the horse was still kicking its hooves and struggling. Xu Jing knew that there was a horse thief. Relying on his own skills, he shouted loudly, "Where did you come from, you thief, dare to steal my horse?" He jumped to the center of the courtyard in one step. At this time, the black shadow saw that someone inside had noticed it. He also drew a pair of mandarin duck hammers from his waist and turned around and said, "Your grandfather is here." He jumped over and hit Xu Jing's head with a hammer. Xu Jing welcomed him with a treasure sword, and a white light flashed in people's eyes. The man knew it was a treasure sword and was afraid that his weapon would be damaged, so he immediately took it back. Xu Jing took the opportunity to use a move of Azure Dragon Takes Water, sweeping towards the man's head with his sword. The man aimed accurately, blocked the back of the sword with his left-hand hammer, and with a clang, Xu Jing's sword was thrown straight away. The man took a step forward, and his right-hand hammer was already hitting Xu Jing's leg. Xu Jing said it was bad, and hurriedly shrank his body back, retreated a few steps, and let the hammer pass. The man waved his double hammers and followed him closely. Xu Jing also opened the Red Phoenix Sword, and the two fought fiercely under the moon. Xu Jing was determined to cut off his hammer head, but on the one hand, the man seemed to know his intentions and avoided the reality and struck the emptiness, not letting the hammer head meet the sword blade head-on; on the other hand, the hammer head was made of fine iron and was very heavy, and it was difficult to cut off for a while; on the third hand, the man's skills were strong, and he danced a pair of mandarin duck hammers like a gust of wind and rain, without any gaps, instead surrounding Xu Jing. After fighting for more than twenty rounds, Xu Jing encountered a strong enemy and was in a difficult situation. Liu San was also awakened by the sound and was very panicked when he saw this scene. He hurriedly ran to the back guest room and saw the bearded guest surnamed Zhang sleeping soundly, not feeling the fight outside. He leaned close to his ear and shouted loudly, "There is a thief outside!" The guest just turned over and fell asleep again. Liu San panicked and used his strength to pinch him hard. Zhang Cangqiu jumped up, rubbed his eyes, and asked, "Who is disturbing my good dream?" Liu San said, "Zhang Ye, there is a big thief outside who has trapped my master. Please help him quickly."

### China Travel Agency Continues to Perform "Hong Xuanjiao" at the Lyceum Theater, Lineup Decided

— Xia

The news that China Travel Agency will present the play "Hong Xuanjiao" was published in yesterday's newspaper. It is known that the China Travel Agency has decided to rent the Lyceum Theater to perform this play from the 14th to the 22nd of next month in order to eliminate various rumors from the outside world.

Since the Lyceum Theater stopped showing movies, it has been rented by various foreign theater troupes to perform Western famous plays in turn. The rent is very expensive and the ticket prices are also high. Most Chinese people are not interested in Western stage plays, so there are many who have never stepped into the Lyceum Theater. However, the Lyceum Theater is beautifully built, and the stage and various equipment are very suitable for performing stage plays. This decision of the China Travel Agency is to show that it solemnly presents a new play, and it does not hesitate to spend a lot of money to rent the theater at night, so that Chinese and foreigners can see this famous Chinese stage play in a standard theater.

"Hong Xuanjiao" is Wei Ruhui's latest five-act historical costume play, with Tang Ruoqing playing the role of Hong Xuanjiao. When Ms. Tang read the script, she was very excited, because the role of Hong Xuanjiao is very suitable for her personality and she has more confidence than playing Ge Nen Nü. Tang Huaiqiu also participated, and all members of the China Travel Agency assisted in the performance.

This decision was specially directed by Fei Mu, who is a first-class director in the film industry, but directing a stage play is still the first time, so the performance of "Hong Xuanjiao" will undoubtedly attract more attention from all people in Shanghai.

### "The Bloody Record of the Heroes"

In recent years, the Soviet Union has paid great attention to the production of historical films. "Peter the Great" and "Pugachev" have already been released in Shanghai; other films such as "Alexander Nevsky" and "Peter the Great" sequel "Lenin in 1918" have not been approved. "The Bloody Record of the Heroes," which will be released at the Dumei Theater on the 13th of this month, is a page in the Russian peasant revolutionary movement of the 17th century. It writes about Shi Jibang, who gathered heroes, raised the banner of uprising, and raged across the rivers and mountains of Russia. He was defeated by government soldiers when attacking Moscow, and the heroes died one by one. Shi Jibang himself fought fiercely for half a month before being captured and executed in Moscow. Shi Jibang is praised as a national hero in Russia, and the peasant riots he led are one of the greatest in Russian history. In terms of acting and photography, "The Bloody Record of the Heroes" is more progressive than "Pugachev."
