London: Reuters' diplomatic correspondent learned last night from well-informed Japanese sources that the meeting between British Prime Minister Churchill and Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu yesterday was fruitful and should greatly help to dispel some misunderstandings between the two countries. (Reuters, 25th)

London: Reliable sources believe that Prime Minister Churchill told Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu yesterday that Japan has no basis to suggest mediating the European war. It is said that Churchill told Shigemitsu that if the Japanese Foreign Minister considers suggesting mediation of the European war, Britain does not know what the basis of the suggestion is. It is known that Matsuoka's previous suggestion was conveyed to British Foreign Secretary Eden by Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, in his private capacity. Reliable sources also said that Churchill did not recognize the Japanese claim that Britain's actions in the Pacific were intended to encircle Japan. The British Prime Minister explained that Britain's precautionary measures in the Pacific were purely for self-defense. Authorities also issued a statement yesterday stating that Britain has a clear observation of the danger of Japan's southward advance. (United Press, 25th)

Tokyo: Cabinet Information Bureau spokesman Ishii said in response to reporters' questions that the Japanese government is considering publishing the full text of Foreign Minister Matsuoka's memorandum to British Foreign Secretary Eden. He said that the content of Eden's meeting with Shigemitsu could not be published without Eden's consent. (United Press, 25th)

London: An authoritative source issued a statement here yesterday stating that Britain has expressed a clear position on the danger of Japan's advance into the South Pacific. This statement was issued while British Prime Minister Churchill was meeting with Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu. The two reviewed the various British-Japanese talks held in London and Tokyo. The statement stated that Britain's concern about Japan's southward advance has been explained in the talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu, and between British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Foreign Minister Matsuoka. (United Press, 25th)

Tokyo: When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii met with foreign correspondents today, he was asked when Foreign Minister Matsuoka's telegram to Eden could be made public. Ishii replied that they are currently considering making the full text of the memorandum public. According to Matsuoka's statement to the House of Representatives yesterday, the memorandum concerned Eden's views on the South China Sea issue and the Tokyo conference to mediate the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, which the British referred to as containing Japan's offer to mediate the European war. Ishii also said that the content of Eden's talks with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu in London could not be published without Eden's consent. (Reuters, 25th)

London: This afternoon, Undersecretary Butler declared in the House of Commons that the Japanese Foreign Minister, in a recent document to Foreign Secretary Eden, first made a general description of the European war, and then stated that Japan was fully prepared to assume the role of mediator, or take any action, to restore peace and normal relations not only for Greater East Asia but also for any place in the world. The Japanese Foreign Minister also expressed in subsequent remarks (which he claimed were made after consultation with Germany) that his words should be regarded as an offer to mediate the European war. In conclusion, Prime Minister Churchill has told the Japanese Foreign Minister that in the principles we are now fighting for (which are unrelated to territorial, commercial, or material gains, but are sufficient to affect the future of mankind), there is no possibility of compromise.

Oceania Belongs to Asia Slogan, US State Department Refuses to Criticize

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently stated that the memorandum he sent to British Foreign Secretary Eden did not involve Germany, and that the so-called mediation was only a minor issue. Matsuoka also commented on Japanese-Soviet relations, advocated that Oceania is an ideal region for Asians, and said that French-Japanese economic negotiations are underway. Matsuoka repeatedly explained the report made by Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Ohashi (according to Ohashi, Matsuoka's note to Eden, the main part of which is we do not recognize Japan's intention to invade the South). However, Matsuoka also said that once the ideal becomes a reality, his memorandum to Eden may be regarded as a suggestion to mediate the European war. Matsuoka's statement was made in response to Fukuda's question in the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. Fukuda asked Matsuoka to clarify the misunderstandings caused by his memorandum. The Japanese Foreign Minister also said that the land has sufficient natural resources to provide for 600 to 800 million people in this Oceania, which is 1,200 miles from north to south and 1,000 miles from east to west. He believes that people have the natural right to migrate there. It is not easy to deal with practical politics based on idealistic claims, but he believes that Caucasians should cede Oceania to Asians. (United Press, 24th)

Washington: The State Department yesterday refused to criticize the suggestion made by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke that Caucasians should give the Pacific Ocean's Oceania to Asians. According to news from Tokyo, Matsuoka told the Lower House yesterday, "I fully advocate that Oceania, which is 1,200 miles from north to south and 1,000 miles from east to west, should be colonized by Asian people." Geographic experts believe that Matsuoka's slogan "Oceania belongs to Asians" includes British, American, and French territories, as well as Hawaii, Samoa, and New Zealand. Kin, the representative of Hawaii and a Pacific geography expert, told a United Press reporter, "Mr. Matsuoka includes even more territories than I know." (United Press, 25th)

London: The Far East situation seems to be more complicated than before due to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's warning in the Diet yesterday that Caucasians should cede Oceania to Asians. Matsuoka's declaration has caused astonishment in London. People in London believe that this declaration is in stark contrast to the diplomatic atmosphere during the earlier talks between British Prime Minister Churchill and Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu. The talks between the British Prime Minister and the Japanese Ambassador were welcomed by British and Japanese people here, who believed that they were sufficient to clarify the current atmosphere, and the general public also believed that these talks might help to relax the situation in the Far East. It is said that Churchill told Shigemitsu that he personally always had a warm feeling for Japan, and recalled the era of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, especially how pleasant the relationship between Britain and Japan was during the Russo-Japanese War. He also said that in view of the previous relationship, it would be a great tragedy if Britain and Japan went to war. At that time, Shigemitsu also said that Japan had no intention of creating a third war dispute in the Pacific. Now, Matsuoka's declaration not only makes people have a new understanding of the meeting between the British Prime Minister and the Japanese Ambassador, but also makes Churchill's warning to Shigemitsu that if Japan insists on its southward advance policy, it will make the tense situation in the Far East even more dangerous, even more important. It is also said that Churchill once told Shigemitsu that although Britain has no intention of attacking Japan, it may be forced to take certain plans for Britain's safety. People here also said that the British Prime Minister also told the Japanese Ambassador that Britain's war aims have not changed since the time of former Prime Minister Chamberlain, that is, to be determined to free Europe from the threat of German aggression. The British Prime Minister's words should have left Shigemitsu with no doubt about Britain's purpose. It is generally expected that Churchill will make a complete statement on Britain's eastward policy to the House of Commons in the near future. It is also said that they also know that Churchill has notified the Japanese Ambassador that Japan has no reason to suggest mediating the European war. (United Press, 25th)

Australian Minister to the United States Observes That the Far East Situation Has Recently Eased

Washington: Republican Congressman Tinkham of Massachusetts claims that he will introduce a bill to Congress to prevent any part of the American fleet from going to Singapore, because if the United States does so, it will be regarded as a hostile act by Japan. (United Press, 25th)

Washington: Australian Minister Keiser told people after a meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Welles yesterday that the Far East situation seemed to have eased in the past four or five days, but the basic situation had not changed. When asked what facts this observation was based on, Keiser said that he could not list any special changes, but he felt that the tension had eased. (United Press, 25th)

Washington: Public opinion here believes that whether a war will occur in the Pacific is still uncertain, and the chances of peace and war are equal. The United States has recently become deeply aware of the important relationship between Singapore and the United States. If Singapore falls into the hands of the Japanese, the supply of American rubber, tin, and tungsten will be interrupted, and American security will be further threatened. Does Tokyo also know the importance the United States attaches to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, or does it still expect that the American fleet will not dare to leave Hawaii under any circumstances? The key to the situation lies in this. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka was slightly embarrassed because he was criticized by Germany for suggesting mediating the European war. From this, it can be seen that Japan's move was not in accordance with Germany's plans, and the theory that Japan's policy is still opportunistic and not part of the Axis' plan is becoming more and more convincing. Those who will bear the brunt of the war in Japan's southward advance are its navy, but recent publications are all from people in the army, and the navy is silent. This is also regarded as a significant matter by people here. (Reuters, 25th)

Tokyo: The "Chugai Commercial Newspaper" published today that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States has been not only unfriendly to Japan. The newspaper declared that the establishment of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" does not mean conquest or oppression. It also said that Japan's southward policy is only a natural economic development. "We do not understand why the United States is blocking Japan's path, because this fact has nothing to do with the United States. Since Japan's just demands have been interfered with, it cannot remain silent forever, and the Japanese people will never succumb to unfair actions, no matter how terrible the consequences." (United Press, 25th)

Sydney: Australian Acting Prime Minister Fadden declared that the Australian government has formally invited Willkie, the former Republican presidential candidate who is visiting Britain, to visit Australia. (Reuters, 25th)

### Thai-Vietnamese Peace Negotiations Still Underway in Tokyo, Ceasefire Agreement Extended Again, Various Obstacles Still Need to Be Overcome

Vichy: The validity period of the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire agreement, which was previously extended once for fifteen days, will expire tomorrow. Japan, in its capacity as mediator, requested a second extension of ten days, which was immediately accepted by France and Thailand. This news has now been confirmed. The negotiations being conducted by the representatives of France, Thailand, and Japan in Tokyo have not been interrupted. There has been no word here of rumors that Vietnam has taken various military preparations, but it is believed that it is possible for the Vietnamese authorities to take preventive measures before the ceasefire agreement expires, because there is a possibility that the war may break out again. Responsible persons said that although there are various obstacles to be overcome in the Tokyo negotiations, it is a good sign that both sides can continue to exchange views. (Havas, 24th)

Japan Claims Dispute Can Be Resolved Soon

Tokyo Cabinet Information Bureau representative spokesman Ishii said today that the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, which is being mediated in Tokyo, will be resolved soon, declaring that the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire has been extended for ten days, "because the resolution is near," and said that the negotiations are proceeding in a friendly manner. Ishii told foreign reporters at a press conference on Monday, "We expect to end this peace conference today, but the border issue is extremely complicated, so the French-Thai ceasefire has been extended for ten days." (United Press, 25th)

London: Radio Paris claimed that the Vietnamese military authorities have revoked all furloughs for officers and soldiers, and the French Far East fleet is currently cruising in the Gulf of Siam. (Reuters, 25th)

Editorial

### The Gradual Easing of the Pacific Situation

No matter from what angle we explore, what Japan's government and people have shown in the past ten days or so indicates that it does not seem to have the determination and preparation to immediately provoke a major war with Britain and the United States. Under the declaration and action preparations of Britain and the United States to resolutely fight, the Japanese side has clearly presented the greatest fluster and anxiety in many years. The fundamental crisis in the Pacific has not only not passed, but is brewing in a more profound place, but just thinking about the evolution of the outbreak of war, one cannot help but feel that the recent situation has eased slightly, and it seems that it can be temporarily delayed for a while. These days, in addition to changing its policy and concentrating all its efforts to explain and express its "peaceful intentions" to Britain and the United States, its arguments on the basic strategy of resisting Britain and the United States are: in case Britain and the United States attack, Japan has sufficient preparation, etc. Of course, Britain and the United States will not immediately launch an attack on Japan first, so this is a redundant statement!

One of the things that Britain and the United States were originally worried about was the pressure that the German-Italian Axis exerted on Japan, forcing it to respond to future German-Italian offensives and take action in the East. Under the current international situation, it is indeed difficult to imagine how Japan can resist such pressure head-on. The other day, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka expressed Japan's willingness to mediate a ceasefire in Europe, which is likely to be a reaction to German-Italian pressure. After this news came out, German officials immediately expressed dissatisfaction, saying that they did not participate in this proposal beforehand, and believed that emphasizing peace was a sign of weakness, and Germany was not weak, so there was no need to hope for peace. However, in addition to not formally responding to Japan's proposal, Britain, in order to win international favorable air, stated that even if Germany had not participated beforehand, Japan was Germany's ally; none of Britain's allied countries had shown such weakness. It is said that Germany was very angry with Japan because of this, and the ambassador to Japan formally questioned the Japanese side, and the Japanese authorities had to disclaim it and blame it on British propaganda and misrepresentation. As to what the truth of this scene is, we will wait for future diplomatic history to answer; but what is worth speculating on at present has two sides: on the one hand, Japan's final hurried denial shows the situation that it cannot resist German-Italian pressure; on the other hand, on the issue of the Pacific War, which is related to its own survival, at least for the time being, it has not listened to the German-Italian intention to make a desperate gamble, and is using various methods of evasion. In the short term, the final between the forces of enticement and evasion between Germany, Italy and Japan is one of the keys to the Pacific issue; before this point is concluded, the big one can still be temporarily safe.

More than ten days ago, another issue that made Britain and the United States very worried was the possible reaction of the Japanese side to the various active measures taken by Britain and the United States in the Far East recently. On the one hand, the procedures for the passage of the "American Lend-Lease Act" are about to be completed, and at the same time, the encircling situation of Britain and the United States against Japan in the Far East is gradually increasing, and the encirclement is gradually shrinking. If this continues, the possibility of realizing Japan's "Greater East Asia New Order" dream is indeed decreasing day by day. Then, perhaps Japan, which has always been known for its seppuku spirit, may disregard success or failure and resist this practical blow with heroic actions. For example, Japan suddenly invaded Thailand, impacting and cutting off China's southwestern route to the outside world, making it impossible for large-scale American aid to reach China in the future; this is not an unexpected action. For example, Japan has repeatedly stated that it will not hesitate to use force to oppose the United States' fortification of Guam when necessary; now the United States has finally disregarded everything and resolutely passed a bill to fortify Guam, which is only 1,500 miles away from Japan's mainland. Then, Japan may be forced to immediately make a serious protest to the United States. Once the United States ignores it, it may immediately recklessly use force. Any one of these kinds of problems has the full potential to cause a Pacific war. However, the facts in the past ten days or so do not show such a tense and bad situation. In addition to not giving any hint of effective countermeasures to the tough steps of Britain and the United States, Japan also revealed very deep fears in its efforts to explain to Britain and the United States. This fear is obviously not limited to a few government authorities, but is indeed widespread to all levels of its people. This can be proved from its recent parliamentary debates or the statements of major newspapers. In his note to Eden, Matsuoka is said to have asked Britain and the United States not to excessively stimulate the emotions of the Japanese people, so as not to rush to extremes, making it impossible for the authorities to restrain them and causing the outbreak of war; however, what has been continuously placed in front of everyone recently is the concern, requests and suggestions of the entire Japanese country for the government authorities to ease relations with Britain and the United States. Therefore, if they still feel that their government's actions are not enough, it must only be on the side of attempting to ease, and absolutely not in resenting the government's lack of initiative and toughness. The radical faction of the Japanese navy once emphasized that "the United States is not to be feared" and severely criticized the so-called "Americanphobia" among a part of the Japanese people, but recently, when faced with the major decision of the US-Japanese war, even these radicals themselves no longer make rash statements; and Admiral Nomura of the navy is a very important figure in the effort to ease relations with the United States. So, why is the tendency so relaxed? Undoubtedly, because the attitude of Britain and the United States is tough, and they have expressed their absolute refusal to compromise with actions!

### China's Air Force Strength to Be Greatly Increased, Urgent Need for Full Assistance from Friendly Countries, Sino-Soviet Transportation Extremely Smooth

Chongqing: The Xinshu Daily published today that its reporter interviewed Mao Bangchu, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Air Force. According to Mao, if the assistance of the United States is obtained, the generals of the Chinese Air Force will revive their heroic spirit and participate in the general counterattack of the Chinese army to defeat the Japanese army. China needs the assistance of friendly countries to rebuild its air force. The assistance we need is multi-faceted, so we need not only the assistance of one friendly country. American public opinion is gradually tending to implement economic and military sanctions against Japan. Mao recently returned to China from the United States. Mao also said that if China can form an alliance with the friendly country of the United States, there is an opportunity to defeat the Japanese immediately, so we should not miss this good opportunity. China's air force will soon increase its strength and participate in the counterattack of the Chinese army. The Japanese are of course jealous of our process of building the air force and want to destroy it, but our efforts do not slacken at all. The strengthening of the Chinese Air Force is an unprecedented force. It is only a matter of time before we show our bravery to the Japanese army. I believe that although the Japanese are committed to advancing southward, they still cannot forget our rear, so the Chinese Air Force is always preparing to cope with the new challenges in this year's bombing season. At present, the assistance of various friendly countries is coming from all sources, and the transport between China and Korea is smooth. We are now training young aviators, and soon there will be air forces all over China. (United Press, 25th)

### Grain Conference Concludes, Director of the National Food Administration Lu Zuofu Presides Over Closing Ceremony, Expresses Satisfaction with Grain Administration in Various Provinces

For example, provinces with surplus grain were providing assistance to those with shortages; provinces near war zones were procuring grain from occupied areas; people were economizing on clothing and food to contribute to military rations; and governments were strictly controlling civilian food supplies. All of this demonstrated that those in charge of grain administration in various provinces had made their utmost efforts, which was commendable and gratifying.

### Tanaka Reports on the Invasion of China

Tokyo - Lieutenant General Tanaka, Director of the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, told the Diet yesterday that the Japanese army currently occupies the best parts of China, namely North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Therefore, resolving the war with China does not require military force. Today, we should focus on economic development in the occupied areas. If this development can be implemented, the interests of both Chinese and Japanese people in these areas will increase, creating a close economic link, which in turn can enhance political relations between the two sides. Tanaka said in response to questions at the House of Representatives Deficit Bond Committee that the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China is currently pursuing a policy of "peace and order first." In this policy, the Japanese army will focus on building railways and barracks, citing "Manchukuo" as an example. Japan began a major program of building barracks in "Manchukuo" in 1935, which is clear evidence of the long-term presence of the Japanese army and has led to significant progress in peace and order. The same effect is gradually being achieved in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and the Shanghai area. Tanaka also spoke about the overall economic situation, saying that Yangzhuang (transliteration) in Shanxi has already produced 300 million tons of anthracite coal. One kilogram of this coal can fuel a truck equipped with a gas generator to travel 59 kilometers. Some people naturally say that we cannot drive cars without oil, but with a little effort, we can obtain the necessary fuel for driving Japanese cars in North China. The fact that the public buses in Tokyo are now using coal from Yangzhuang is proof of this. Tanaka also mentioned the production of iron, saying that the iron factory built by Yan Xishan has been improved by the Japanese and can now produce 60,000 to 70,000 tons of cast iron annually, meeting the entire demand of North China. Tanaka suggested developing the resources of Shanxi to meet the needs of North China. In this way, the raw materials obtained in the Tianjin area can be transported to Japan to alleviate Japan's shortage of materials. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

### Soviet Union Adopts a Policy of Non-Interference in Balkan Affairs to Avoid Military Conflict with Germany. US Holds Important Talks with Turkey and Greece.

Sofia - Reliable sources indicate that the Soviet government has hinted to the governments of the Balkan countries that the Soviet Union has decided not to interfere in any events in the Balkan countries in order to avoid military conflict with Germany. This notification was not made through official documents, notes, or formal meetings, but was still communicated through diplomatic channels. (25th United Press Dispatch)

London - Sources here recently acknowledged the importance of the talks between the British Prime Minister and the Turkish Ambassador to the UK, Aras, and the Greek Minister to the UK, Simopoulos. Once Bulgaria is occupied, it is feared that the Allied countries may take countermeasures. Although the nature of the talks is not known to outsiders, a well-informed "Times" diplomatic correspondent asserted that the policies adopted by Britain, Greece, and Turkey once Bulgaria is occupied have become very clear. There may still be many policies that cannot be made public for the time being. The correspondent also stated that since the last European war, if Britain has not allowed Bulgaria to be used by Germany as a base for aggression against Britain and the Allied countries, Britain should respect Bulgaria's neutrality. It is expected that Churchill has already told Aras that he firmly believes that Turkey will fulfill its obligations to the Allied countries. (26th United Press Dispatch)

Ankara - The famous Turkish newspaper "Ateş" stated that the remarks made by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu on Sunday clearly indicate that the establishment of the Turkish-Bulgarian Friendship Treaty has not changed Turkish foreign policy in any way. Because overseas critics have distorted the interpretation of this agreement, it is necessary to make a statement. These critics have ignored the needs of Turkish national defense and internal security and have failed to note that Bulgaria is independent and the master of its own territory and rights. The newspaper finally stressed that both sides declared in the agreement that they would not commit aggression against third parties, would be loyal to their obligations, would not commit aggression against each other or against third parties, would not incite or support attacks against third parties, and were determined not to commit unilateral aggression against third parties. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

Vichy - Diplomatic circles here have recently stated that there are various factors to prove that all Balkan countries are willing to stay out of the European war. For example, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu repeatedly stated that the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact does not affect the existing treaty obligations undertaken by the country, and expressed his willingness to sign similar agreements with other countries. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markovic's visit to Budapest proves that all countries in the Balkans are willing to reaffirm their desire for peace. The Balkan Peninsula has always been known as the gunpowder keg of Europe. A small spark is enough to start a prairie fire. Now that the countries concerned have made the above-mentioned expressions, it is worthy of attention. (24th Havas Dispatch)

Sofia Feels Uneasy on the Eve of the German Invasion of Bulgaria

Southern Capital City - Today, news received here states that Bulgaria experienced its first blackout last night. At the same time, the government is implementing the most stringent inspections of news, mail, and telephones. King Boris of Bulgaria has met with a delegation of 25 opposition leaders who want to ask the King to try to avoid war. However, it is claimed that only the leaders of the "loyal" opposition party were received, while pro-German elements and communists were rejected. News from Sofia today reports rumors that several German military detachments have crossed the Danube River from Romania into Bulgaria, but officials do not believe these rumors. Eight leaders of the Bulgarian Radical Farmers' Party, including former cabinet member Velchev, were banned for "endangering public order," which shows the tension inside Bulgaria. Knowledgeable sources here predict that Hitler will gradually infiltrate Bulgaria, rather than wanting to flow into Bulgaria suddenly. Many believe that several detachments of German technical troops are now quietly occupying key points in Bulgaria, especially airports, which is important. Therefore, Germany does not need to challenge Bulgaria's sovereignty to achieve the goal of controlling the center of Bulgaria. It is alleged that the same strategy has already been applied to Romania. Knowledgeable people insist that the German army will postpone going to the Greek border because the German side still believes that a solution to the Italo-Greek war may be possible. According to political observers, the implementation of blackouts throughout Bulgaria last night reflects that Germany's correct intentions have not yet been decided. (25th International Dispatch)

### British Troop Landing Proposal Rejected by Greece. Heavy Rain and Fog in Albania, Only Localized Fighting.

London - According to news here today, the proposal from London for British troops to immediately land in Thessaloniki has been rejected by Greece. According to diplomatic circles here, Greek Minister to the UK Simopoulos told British Prime Minister Churchill that the Greek government does not want British troops to land unless or until German troops actually invade Greece. It is understood that British military experts advocate immediately sending an expeditionary force to land in Greece, believing that if British troops wait for German troops to invade Greece, then they will not be able to launch it. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

London - The Athens Radio Station said last night that the fighting between the Greek army against the Italian army in Albania has been restricted due to heavy rain and fog. The Greek army cleared out the remnants of the enemy in the large mountain ridges and Kunyun areas recently seized, and as a result, captured a large number of Italian soldiers and obtained a lot of military equipment and war tools. The Greek army's patrol activities are also quite successful. In a certain local battle, the Greek army completely defeated the Italian army and destroyed two enemy planes. Three more Italian planes were shot down, and two were seriously damaged. According to a Reuters correspondent from the Albanian border, British planes have been continuously bombing the Italian army positions in the Shugbi River valley, Erba Jieyilin, and Pogradetz areas since 3:00 AM yesterday morning. The Italian army in the area was reinforced last week. The artillery units in the South Taifuri River and Fuyu Xia River valleys intensely bombarded each other. There were local battles in several places. Italian infantry attacks were severely damaged and retreated. The Greek army has seized an important high ground in the Osteravica ​​Mountain that controls the Italian army's vanguard position. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

However, these destroyers have not had the opportunity to clash with enemy ships that our submarines have already obtained. Because our destroyers provoked the shelling of Valona, ​​Italian ships did not appear." (25th Reuters Dispatch)

### Britain Invents New Method to Deal with German Submarine Warfare. Germany Claims to Have Destroyed Over 210,000 Tons of British Ships. London Officials Denounce as False Propaganda.

London - According to news today, Hitler threatened with an "unimaginable" submarine blitzkrieg, but the British Navy's response to this threat is to use the latest invention of secret methods to capture and destroy submarines. When the submarine war intensifies in the spring, British destroyers, mine-hunting ships, etc. will not only prevent submarines, but will also implement a more effective offensive war. This offensive war is unprecedented since the failure of France. The British Navy's anti-submarine strategy is the most secretive in the war, but naval research experts have spent months inventing new methods to replace or enhance the outdated methods of searching for submarines. New methods will soon be used to greatly enhance the effectiveness of the navy's anti-submarine patrols and restore the situation in the first few months of the war, when ship losses were minimal and submarines that launched attacks were destroyed every day. In the second half of 1940, British ship losses increased. Officials did not explain the reason, but it may be due to the occupation of France, and Germany's acquisition of part of the French fleet. Diplomatic observers speculated that because of the close Anglo-French coordination, the United Kingdom transferred important secrets of submarine prevention equipment to France. The basic principles of the British method have obviously been verified by the German side on French ships, so the German side has learned detailed information about the United Kingdom's new equipment and its application methods, so the submarine commander has become more cautious to prevent being captured. (25th United Press Dispatch)

London - Responsible sources here claim that Hitler's claim in his speech yesterday afternoon that the German side had sunk enemy ships totaling more than 200,000 tons is a fantasy far from the truth, as evidenced by previous claims by the German side. For example, in the British convoy attack in the Gulf of Gavres, the German side claimed to have sunk the entire convoy of 86,000 tons. In fact, 33 of the 38 ships in the convoy safely arrived in port. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

London - The German communique of February 14 claimed that a certain German attack ship had sunk 14 ships in a convoy, totaling 82,000 tons, which has been proven to be false by the Admiralty's announcement. According to reports, the total loss of merchant ships in the week ending February 16 was 12 ships, totaling 37,636 tons, of which 11 belonged to British ships, and only one belonged to Allied ships. The announcement also said that Hitler's speech said that the German side had sunk ships totaling 215,000 tons in the past few days, which was not the case. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

Berlin - This morning, the German official document stated that Hitler declared in his speech in Munich yesterday that in the past two days, the German side had sunk enemy cargo ships totaling 215,000 tons. However, according to the German government's latest report, the total loss of enemy cargo ships actually reached 250,000 tons. (25th Haitong Dispatch)

### German Planes Attack British Convoy in the Eastern Mediterranean. Heavy Damage to a Giant Ship Unconfirmed.

London - Yesterday, the Italian military headquarters communique stated that a German air force team attacked a British fleet in the eastern Mediterranean. A giant British ship was hit and damaged, and was almost sunk. This statement has not been confirmed in London. According to a Reuters correspondent in the British fleet in the Mediterranean, a part of the British fleet continues to maintain traffic along the Libyan coast, while the main fleet cruises in the central Mediterranean for four days, repelling German dive bombers and successfully protecting merchant ships traveling in convoys. German dive bombers flew from Italian bases, intending to sink the merchant fleet under the protection of the British fleet and attack the British fleet. However, the British side did not suffer any damage, and the German planes were driven back and damaged. There is an aircraft carrier in the British fleet, which can be a target for German planes, but German planes only dropped bombs on other ships, because they have not forgotten the heavy damage they suffered the last time they attacked the British aircraft carrier "Renown." In addition to safely escorting a large number of merchant ships, the British fleet also swept the sea according to plan and was not hindered by German dive bombers or the Italian fleet. The Italian fleet has not appeared so far. Although enemy planes have been watching all day, trying to follow the British fleet's actions, they immediately fled when they saw British fighter planes taking off from the aircraft carrier. Finally, a team of Ockel or bombers was overtaken by British planes. The German planes then threw bombs into the sea, intending to increase their speed in order to escape, but it was ineffective. As a result, one German plane caught fire and crashed into the sea. At dusk, another team of German planes came out of the clouds, but they also failed to launch an attack. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

### US Investigating Sinking of British Ship Flying US Flag

### Hitler's Full Speech on the Anniversary of the Founding of the Nazi Party, Vowing to Launch a Naval Offensive Against Britain and Considering 1941 as the Year of Victory

Munich - German Führer Adolf Hitler, amidst the cheers of veteran party members, entered the historically significant and renowned beer hall at 5:05 PM last night. Munich "District" Leader Wagner stepped forward to greet him, assuring the Führer of Germany's faith in and love for him, stating, "The Führer is leading Germany in the most magnificent war in history. Führer Hitler will surely achieve victory, and the plutocratic politics of Britain will inevitably perish." Hitler then delivered a speech, recounting the founding of the Nazi Party twenty-one years ago, stating:

The Nazi Movement's History

The Nazi Party's struggle has lasted twenty-one years, and it is rare in history to still be able to speak with you all here. It is also unprecedented for someone to continue to fight unyieldingly for their ideals and doctrines of twenty-one years ago and to have put them into practice. From the beginning of our party's organization, we have always put the interests of the entire German nation first. This proposition has been consistently upheld and has never changed. The reasons for Germany's defeat in World War I and the oppression of the Treaty of Versailles were due to political errors that were sown before the war, not after. The political leaders at the time did not take appropriate measures in domestic and foreign affairs. However, one point cannot be blamed on the political leaders of the time: they did not really need war; if they had needed war, they would have been fully prepared, and the result would not have been defeat. Although military errors were also committed, German soldiers persevered with the enemy for four years, which was admired by the world. From this, it can be seen that Germany's defeat was not due to poor frontline combat but to domestic corruption. At that time, there were two conflicting political ideals in Germany: nationalism and socialism. The impact of this was to cause the country to fall apart. After the Nazi movement rose up, I deeply knew that even if it won the support of the entire nation, it would not be able to improve Germany's domestic and foreign affairs. Therefore, the Nazi movement strived towards this goal.

Breaking Free from the Shackles of the Treaty

The external oppression we suffered at that time was the Treaty of Versailles. At that time, I gave my first speech here, urging the people of the whole country to recover from the great humiliation that Germany had suffered. This treaty brought political and economic disaster to the German nation. Diplomatically, all of Germany's rights were deprived. The heavy reparations almost destroyed any hope of economic revival for the German nation. At that time, Germany faced economic difficulties, a sharp increase in unemployment, a rapid decline in living standards, a decrease in population, and the suffering of economic slavery. There was no greater suffering than this. This aroused the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working class, gradually arousing the sympathy of the world. However, the doctrine of the Nazi movement is "God helps those who help themselves." When we first launched the Nazi movement, we knew that the Treaty of Versailles could not be lifted by indecision. Only with strong national power could we break free from this shackle. Therefore, the Nazi movement worked hard to purge the political parties within the country and first sought to improve domestic affairs. These two major revolutions occurred in Europe: the Nazi and Fascist revolutions, both achieving the same results.

Germany and Italy Share Fortune and Misfortune

But the world initially did not pay attention, thinking that Germany's national power was weak, and its public opinion was not strong. It was impossible to form this social torrent. The Nazi and Fascist movements then moved forward together. The strength of their unity is beyond ordinary alliances. Our enemies at that time really could not understand that I had made a friend, and because we had the same enemies, we all held the sincerity of helping each other. Recently, Italy's assistance to us in the war, restraining Britain's land, sea, and air forces in Africa, is clear evidence of this.

Launching a Naval War Against Britain

I received a report from the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy two hours ago, stating that the activities of our country's submarines have recently sunk another 215,000 tons of enemy ships. From March to April, you will see more intense actions. The time will prove that we have been dormant due to the winter. Our dive bombers have now made it impossible for British ships in the North Sea and the Mediterranean to move freely. In short, wherever the footsteps of Britain reach, we will drive them away. Wherever British ships sail, our country's submarines will attack them. In the spring of 1941, Britain will attack the mainland. I am waiting for their attack. Britain has launched its offensive elsewhere, but wherever the enemy goes, we will come out to meet them and give them the most significant blow. Hitler then expressed his desire to negotiate and disarm, saying, "I am willing to follow the path of negotiation to solve everything. Negotiation can reduce bloodshed and complete what is desired. We are by no means ignorant. Things that can be resolved with justice can be resolved by force. However, Germany needs to survive, so it must obtain the conditions necessary for survival. Others have no reason to deprive us of the right to live. Countries that already have 38 million square kilometers of territory should not seize another 2.5 million square kilometers of land from another country. We can no longer tolerate the rule of other countries and listen to their economic policies that force us to follow." (To be continued)

### Random Talks on the European War (30) (7) Bulgaria's Dilemma

Strategically, Bulgaria's situation in 1941 is like that of the Netherlands and Belgium in 1940.

The German strategy is to defeat Britain, but Britain is visible but unreachable, so in May of last year, it attacked France via the Netherlands and Belgium, hoping to annihilate the main force of the Anglo-French Allied Forces. By this year, this main force has moved to the eastern Mediterranean line. For example, the Greek army has attacked Albania, and the British and Australian armies are making steady progress in Italian Libya in North Africa. Except for going through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, the German army has no other way to directly attack the British Empire. Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have changed places with the Netherlands and Belgium.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov went to Vienna and Berlin, ostensibly to visit famous doctors Aibinquan to treat stomach ulcers. His whereabouts became the target of news reporters for a while. Whether his trip had other purposes is unknown to outsiders. However, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a strange statement, saying that if German vehicles requested to pass through to Greece, Bulgaria would have no choice but to accept. At the same time, Berlin was also tight-lipped about the whereabouts of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop.

Filov stayed in Vienna for five days before returning home and immediately told reporters in secret, "The American side is rumored to have made a trip to Germany, which is completely untrue." But the day after he returned to Beijing, he hurried to Koriya, 43 miles away, to meet King Boris III and report on the treatment of his illness. The next day, his father and the king discussed everything again, and that night he hurried back to Beijing to convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting.

Filov's busy schedule must have something more serious than his stomach ulcer. In other words, it is about Bulgaria allowing the German army to pass through to attack Greece. How Bulgaria decides is irrelevant. The German army can force its way through regardless of everything. However, it is a fact that cannot be ignored that it may affect the Soviet Union and Turkey.

Boris is an amiable king. Although he participated in several Balkan battles and the last World War, he is very willing to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. He often likes to travel incognito, repair machines, play with hunting dogs, and chat with farmers, making people believe that he does not regard himself as a noble. He once said, "If I lose the throne, I don't really care. If it comes true one day, I might as well go to the United States and become a mechanic."

Bulgaria is currently the focus of the situation, and Boris has become the center of pressure from all parties. He governs the Slavic people. Most of his bloodline comes from France. His relatives are all royal families in Britain, Belgium, Portugal, and Romania. Queen Ioanna is an Italian princess. He himself believes in the Greek Orthodox Church, and Tsar Nicholas II was originally his godfather. His father, King Ferdinand, has been in exile in Germany for twenty-two years.

In addition to these personal relationships, Bulgaria is the Soviet Union's closest ally in Europe and a necessary route for Germany to expand into the Near East. Recently, someone asked Boris what Bulgaria's foreign policy was. He replied, "My cabinet is pro-German, the Queen is pro-Italian, my people are pro-Soviet, and only I am neutral."

Boris's remarks are not an exaggeration. The Bulgarian nation's language, culture, customs, bloodline, and emotions are all close to the Soviet Union, but the cabinet ministers, especially Prime Minister Filov and Interior Minister Jabrovski, advocate following Germany's orders. The Queen naturally favors Italy, and only Boris, within the possible scope, insists that Bulgaria should be independent and autonomous by Bulgarians. But his claims are unlikely to be realized. Last November, after he returned from a visit to Berlin, German Air Force Minister Goering told Bulgarian visitors, "Your king is too conservative and neutral, and he is incompatible with us. Fortunately, there will be no more emperors in the new European situation."

Strength Not as Good as Last Year's Washington University

Based on yesterday's performance, the team is probably just a second-rate team in the United States. There is nothing particularly outstanding about them, and there are few new tactics. The whole game mostly uses the central turn to shoot and score. After being blown "more than three seconds" several times, Okejara changed to turning around and shooting around the basket. Because Li Zhenzhong could not guard him, he scored repeatedly. Okejara is the most dangerous person in the whole team, followed by Crowt. In terms of strength, it is far less than Washington University, which came to Shanghai last year, at least 30% worse. Last night, the ingenious smoke screen obstacle attack method was performed from the water.

Shanghai Team Takes the Lead Supernaturally

The Shanghai combined team first responded with Henry Sahwits, Li Zhenzhong, Mansi, Chen Xuesong, Bao Songyuan. The performance of Henry, Li, and Man is wonderful. The three are indispensable. Chen Xuesong is average. Bao Songyuan often likes to fight alone to score points. In the first half, the combined team had a great momentum and took the lead all the way. The visiting team could not think of any way. Li Zhenzhong set a national record, followed by Henry Sahwits, first scoring four to zero. Okejara scored two goals in a row. But Bao Songyuan and Chen Xuesong scored four points again. The Shanghai team took the lead by two points for a long time. At sixteen to ten, Ruchi entered the lane, Chen Xuesong, Mansi's wonderful shots, the Shanghai team once took the lead by six points with twenty-three to seventeen, twenty-nine to twenty-three. Okejara scored consecutively, and the visiting team chased to a tie of nineteen each, and thirty-one. The first half ended with thirty-four to thirty-one, taking the lead by three points.

Fouls Repeatedly, Four Players Fined

At the beginning of the second half, Mansi and Ruchi scored three points in a row, and it became a tie of thirty-four again, and then twenty-seven to thirty-six, which was the second time the Shanghai team exceeded. The Shanghai team seemed to be physically weak, and their stamina was not as good, and the situation gradually declined. At forty-one to forty-eight, Henry Sahwits was fined, forty-one to forty-nine, and the other party's Paul was fined. Henry exited, Chen Xuesong entered again, and Paul exited Xiang Shengjin. Since Paul exited, the Shanghai team took advantage of the situation and rushed to catch up to forty-seven to forty-nine, only two points behind. Unfortunately, they failed to enter again. Forty-eight to fifty-six, Li Zhenzhong was fined, and Ren Xiangcheng entered, forty-eight to fifty-nine, and Okejara, the main general of the visiting team, was also fined. In the second half, a total of four generals were fined. Jingins finally transferred Chen Xuesong, and the momentum was revived, scoring ten points in one breath. Unfortunately, the time had come, and the conclusion was sixty-eight to sixty-three, only five points behind.

The Visiting Team Gets 100 US Dollars

Under the ambition of foreign rice dealers to fill their insatiable desires, the market has long been abnormal and cannot be balanced with the right reason of production, sales, and storage. Yesterday, the holder still refused to release samples, and the brokers did not come to the market to trade. The market is still in chaos and is secretly rising. Although Siam and Saigon had a small number of quotas to respond to, the broken rice Yinghua Company has still added one yuan. Foreign dollars, after the transfer of the hoarding households, saw a horizontal jump of one and a half yuan again, but most of them hope that the unexpected high price will come with the Pacific War. Therefore, the total transaction of spot goods is less than 1,000 bags, and the futures are less than 200 tons, but in fact, a part of the stored rice warehouse has reached 950,000 bags, and there are more than this number. There are more than 30,000 new arrivals. According to the order, Yu Long threw out 6,600 tons of Mindang in April yesterday, at a price of 100 yuan.

Therefore, the masses will be more and more bitter.

The national rice markets, such as thick and thin japonica, are still strong.

Therefore, once asked, the price will increase by one or two yuan. Hong Kong special Yuan opened 90 yuan, the second class 87 yuan and a half, glutinous rice seal 82 yuan.

The Guangdong-Hong Kong help handled more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, color materials, etc., and the North Road Yanjin help handled more than 100 pieces of Fuchou and colored cloth. On the 26th, 27 pieces of piece head were shipped to Xiamen, and 495 pieces were connected to Hong Kong.

East Cloth The rising wind is stewed again. The leader labeled cloth futures (trading place) The market opened at 49 yuan and 01 minute in March. However, at the closing, the floating profit was transferred and sold due to the decline of gold, which was suppressed to 47 yuan, 7 jiao, 48 yuan, 3 jiao in April, and 49 yuan, 3 jiao and 6 minutes in May. The spot market was suspended all day due to the occurrence of counterfeit depot receipt disputes, and the industry was in high spirits. Anpan transactions were still made. 12-pound flying fish fine cloth was 47 yuan, 5 jiao, the leader fine cloth was 47 yuan, and the four gentlemen beeped a few yuan, 3 jiao.

### The Sugar Market and Sugar Prices are Flat

Yesterday's sugar market did not change much. The association divided the market. The spot price of 24 crude white outside warehouse was 79 yuan and a half to 79 yuan and 8 jiao, the delivery note on March 10 was 80 yuan, 3 jiao to 80 yuan, 1 jiao, the delivery note on March 20 was still 80 yuan and 6 jiao, the Dutch red was 61 yuan, 2 jiao, and the Taikoo Car White B Mark West warehouse was 79 yuan and a half, the East warehouse was 79 yuan, and the DY Mark was 78 yuan, 2 jiao. Because the production price of domestic new diao qing is still difficult to agree on, there is still a lack of transport, and there is no transaction of Chen goods.

### Oil and Oil Cake Market: Crackdown on Futures Trading Has Little Impact on Spot Prices

The oil cake market, due to control by speculators, has experienced a rather alarming state of trading, with strange cries and shouts that are even more chaotic than in the exchange era. Most of the transactions are short selling and buying long. Once a loss occurs, disputes frequently arise. Several such incidents have already occurred. Therefore, the market authorities, in order to prepare for potential problems, have issued a public notice to the market, banning futures trading. As a result, all oil cake futures transactions have come to a standstill. There has been little fluctuation in the spot market. 100 units of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at a price of 105.6 yuan. 50 units of Yantai raw oil were traded at a price of 104 yuan. Also, 1,000 cans of canned raw oil were traded at a price of 138 yuan. 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded at a price of 147 yuan. 30 barrels of Jiangbei local mill raw oil were traded at a price of 142 yuan. 100 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil were traded at a price of 91 yuan. 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at a price of 119 yuan. 500 pieces of Shengji soybean cake were traded at a price of 14 yuan, 8 jiao and a half. 10 carts of Feizi brand cake were priced at 14 yuan, 8 jiao to 8 jiao and a half. 5 carts of Yuanlong cake were priced at 14 yuan, 9 jiao to 15 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Liyu cake were priced at 14 yuan, 6 jiao, and 1,000 pieces of Zhifa brand cake were priced at 14 yuan, 7 jiao and a half.

Furthermore, today (the 26th), 610 bags of soybeans and 320 bags of raw peanuts were exported to Xiamen. In addition, 200 bags of soybeans, 9,200 pieces of soybean cake, 1,000 cans of soybean oil, and 550 units and 500 cans of raw oil were all shipped to Hong Kong.

### Coal Market: Huaibei Coal Sales Not Bad

Since the first batch of new Huaibei bituminous coal arrived last month, sales in this street have been fairly good. Therefore, another 2,200 tons arrived yesterday and are being sold by the manager of a certain foreign firm. Prices among competitors are: Huaibei lump coal is 176 yuan per ton, and coal dust is 154 yuan per ton. The quality of the dust is considered better, as the screened lumps contain more stone. Therefore, the dust has a wider market.

### Medicinal Materials: Chaozhou Bark Expected to Rise

Chaozhou bark has been in short supply for a long time. Merchants in the market are all out of stock. Even ordinary goods are about to be exhausted, so the trend is very tight. Yesterday, news from the trade indicated that new goods from the producing areas are being shipped out, but costs will inevitably increase. Larger sizes are up 20 to 30 yuan from previous prices.

### Miscellaneous: Candles Up Three Yuan

Due to problems with the source of raw materials, Whiteley's Ship Brand candles, in packs of 25, increased by 2 yuan yesterday, according to the company's announcement. The new price is 11 yuan and 4 jiao. The selling prices of other brands have also risen in unison.

### Hardware: Ribbed Steel Bars Hovering

The ribbed steel bar market seems to be in a state of hovering. The Northern Ocean and Yangtze River inland waterway merchants are experiencing sluggish sales. Furthermore, construction companies on this street have not seen a flourishing of construction projects. Therefore, the buying and selling of this commodity by construction companies has not been lively. The market situation remains bleak, causing standard selling prices to decline. Currently, fine sizes of 3/4 inch are priced at 2,050 yuan per ton, while coarser sizes of 5/8 inch and above are only selling for 2,000 yuan per ton. In addition, goods such as local factory round nails, tie wire, and new round steel are mostly not selling well. The market trend is hovering, and prices are softening. Currently, round nails are 100 yuan, new round steel is 110 yuan, and tie wire is 90 yuan, all of which have fallen slightly compared to the previous market.

### Seafood: Jian'gu Mushrooms Continue to Rise

Domestic Fujian fragrant mushrooms have been in short supply recently, and market stocks are becoming increasingly scarce. Therefore, market prices have risen again. Yesterday, higher-quality mushrooms sold for 710 yuan, and slightly lower-quality mushrooms sold for 690 yuan, an increase of more than 20 yuan from before.

### Domestic Fragrant Mushrooms in Short Supply

Domestic fragrant mushrooms are in scarce supply. Only Fujian goods are available on the market, priced at 678 yuan. Japanese goods are priced higher: the best quality is 875 yuan, and the next best is 809 yuan. Winter mushrooms are priced at 1,150 yuan for high quality and 880 yuan for ordinary quality. The market is firm and not easily loosened.

### Economic Talk: Timepieces and Water Clocks (Continued)

— Feng Liutang

However, even for a family like the Ningguo Prefecture, only eighteen timepieces were found during the confiscation of their property later on. It is said that during the Jiaqing era, when Heshen's home was raided, ten large chiming clocks, one hundred and fifty-six small chiming clocks, three hundred table clocks, and eighty pocket watches were confiscated. Today, even a clock and watch shop may not have as many treasures as Heshen had in his home. In the past, the Qing Palace favored musical clocks, calling them alarm clocks. A Qing Palace poem describes them:

"Pearls serve as curtains, embroidered lotus flowers adorn,
When singing and dancing cease, one lazily stretches,
Awakening from dreams, one still suspects music plays,
A new-style musical alarm clock chimes."

How did the watch get its name? We must trace back to the old timepieces used in China, which consisted of a tall pole measuring eight feet, used to measure the shadow of the sun to determine the time. This is the method used by the Grand Minister of Education in the Zhou Dynasty, who used an earth sundial to determine the position of the sun and locate the center of the earth. When Western clocks and watches flowed in, China named the clocks that could chime on their own as "self-ringing clocks." Then, the ones that did not chime but could be carried in one's pocket were named "watches," using the name of the old Chinese sun-measuring device. Today, some people, because they are made of metal, add the "gold" radical to the left of the character for "watch," resulting in the character 錶, which misses the original intention of the name. However, most people still use the original character 表.

Watches cannot chime without movement. A chiming gold watch can sound the time when a button is pressed. In the past, watches were also called "self-moving watches" or "time watches," but they were commonly referred to as "watches."

Clocks and watches were considered rare treasures in the early Qing Dynasty. After the opening of the sea ban during the Daoguang era, circulation gradually increased. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras, Guo Songtao wrote to Li Hongzhang, saying, "Clocks, watches, and toys are in every household." However, they are still not as common as they are in society today.

In the past, China did not have clocks and watches, so water clocks, or copper dripping clocks, were used. The water clock system has a very long history. The Zhou Rituals mention the "Pitcher Carrier," who was in charge of carrying water to use in the water clock, and used water and fire to guard it, dividing day and night, so as to observe the water clock's filling and emptying, and distinguish the length of dusk and dawn.

### The Kuomintang and Communist Parties are Incredibly Harmonious and the United Front is Increasingly Solid; Rumors are Purely Malicious Slander; Military Discipline is Absolutely Supported by All Parties

According to a recent observer and an authoritative foreign expert from mainland China, the relationship between some members of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is somewhat tense. However, the "United Front" between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party remains incredibly harmonious. There are indeed "disputes between the two parties, but various rumors from the outside are purely intentional fabrication and slander by those who deliberately undermine Chinese unity. The measures taken by the Chinese military authorities to rectify the discipline of the New Fourth Army, although regarded as "drastic measures," have not caused adverse effects in the country. Public opinion generally believes that this move is a necessary measure for rectifying military discipline.

No Rift Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party

The observer continued, "True Communist Party members who do not participate in the National Government are inevitably indignant about the disbandment of the New Fourth Army. However, people like Zhou Enlai remain calm about the government's order to disband the New Fourth Army and try to reconcile the existing disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At the same time, this action is advocated by some members of the Kuomintang, and most Kuomintang members are not involved in the matter. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as a split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

President Chiang Kai-shek's Prestige is Increasing

The reason why some members of the Kuomintang are strongly advocating the rectification of military discipline is that the Communist Party's army does not obey the orders issued by the supreme military authorities, which is admitted even by left-wing figures. The disbandment of the Communist army is believed to be "deserved." Those who oppose China's position exaggerate the matter, but they do not know that President Chiang Kai-shek is supported by all parties and that the resolution of this incident has further enhanced his prestige. Since the incident occurred, all parties have reiterated their loyalty to President Chiang Kai-shek.

The United Front is Exceptionally Strong

The foreign observer has traveled to various places in Free China and has spoken with various people, from farmers and workers to government officials and military officers. None of them admit that the "United Front" is in danger of being split. Even Communist Party leaders think so. At the same time, all responsible parties believe that although liberalism is sometimes regarded as communism, the circulation of liberalism is still permitted during the war, and all parties are allowed to freely express their opinions.

Traitors Cannot Operate

The observer said, "There are many true liberals in China's 'youth army.' They all hold the belief of reforming society and hope to implement a social revolution to seek welfare for the people. When talking about the general political development of Free China, the observer said that the strength of the Kuomintang is an undeniable fact. In recent months, party leaders have strengthened the party's organization, and as a result, the opportunities for traitors and unruly elements hiding in Free China to operate have been greatly reduced. This situation is unprecedented since the outbreak of the Free War.

### Railway Tracks Near Jiaxing Bombed

According to news from the transportation sector, the railway tracks of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway at Qixingqiao near Jiaxing were bombed and destroyed by Chinese guerrillas yesterday, causing traffic to be interrupted. The extent of the loss is unknown.

### The Fang Dan Case: Seventh Hearing

The case of four Chinese landlords suing the Public Works Department (工部局) for collecting land taxes was heard for the seventh time in the Consular Court at 2:30 pm yesterday in the conference hall on the second floor of the Public Works Department. The secretary of the Consular Court, Mr. Lang, the lawyer for the Public Works Department, Chuan Liang, the witness Ru Bao Yi, the plaintiffs Fang Jiaping, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, and Fang Wende, and the lawyers for the defense, Liu Shifang and Wang Jian, were all present. After announcing the opening of the court at 2:30 pm, lawyer Bolang asked the witness Ru Bao Yi about the evidence of land ownership. Lawyer Ru replied, "According to various ancient Chinese books, it is known that land ownership in China belongs to the emperor, not to the people." He presented eight or nine books in court as evidence, including Mencius, Zhouli, Hanshu, and Wenxian Tongkao. At around 3:00 pm, Bolang further questioned Mr. Middleton, the Director of the Department of Taxes, asking, "Why did the Public Works Department not collect taxes from landlords before 1937?" Mr. Middleton replied, "Because the names of the landlords were unknown, and the area of the land could not be found." Chuan Liang further asked Mr. Middleton, "If the land tax on Fang Dan were collected in 1940, what would be the annual tax amount?" Mr. Middleton replied, "The number is between 2 million and 3 million." At the appropriate time, the court adjourned, and it was decided that the hearing would continue at the original site of the Public Works Department this Friday (the 28th).

### Ke Ziewe Returns to Shanghai from the Philippines

### A Large Number of American Nationals Evacuate Today to Return Home; Berths on the President Pierce are Also Being Booked; Colonel Xiang Pei Encourages the Members of the Merchant Corps

The President Coolidge of the American President Lines returned yesterday from Little Luzon, arriving in Shanghai via Hong Kong. Passengers were allowed to land at the Customs Wharf at 2:30 pm yesterday. The ship will depart at 11:30 am this morning as scheduled, passing through Kobe and Yokohama, Japan, and returning to San Francisco. 168 people came from Southeast Asia on this ship, and as many as 775 people are taking the same ship back to the United States via Shanghai. Many American nationals in the city are evacuating and returning to their home country on this ship, but the exact number has not yet been announced by the company. The next American ship leaving Shanghai for the United States is the President Pierce, scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States on March 8. It is reported that a large number of American nationals have already booked tickets on this ship to prepare for evacuation, but the number does not seem to be more than that of the President Coolidge leaving Shanghai tomorrow.

Colonel Xiang Pei's Farewell Message

Colonel Xiang Pei, the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, has completed his term of office from December 1937 to midnight on the 24th of this month, and will leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge today. His post will be succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Mann, a veteran officer of the corps. Before leaving, Colonel Xiang Pei gave a farewell message to his subordinates, which read: "Before I hand over the position of commander of the Volunteer Corps to my successor, I am very pleased and grateful for the good work completed by all members under my command since 1937. In the past three years, the Volunteer Corps has undertaken extra work, the most notable of which was the defense of Area B of the Public Concession after the withdrawal of British troops in December last year. I am sure that every member has done their best. I am well aware that the defense work in Area B has sacrificed your rest time. At the same time, I would like to thank the senior officers of the corps, whose good advice, close cooperation, and friendship have helped me a lot. I attach great importance to the common goals and true international spirit of our corps, and I am especially grateful for your hospitality and kindness. I am sorry to leave Shanghai this time, but the pleasant memories of Shanghai will always be in my mind. The Volunteer Corps has had good achievements in the past. Maintaining this achievement in the future is also up to the efforts of each of you. I wish you all a bright future and good luck and prosperity in the future."

The Grand Farewell Banquet for the Corps

The officers of the entire Shanghai Volunteer Corps held a farewell banquet for Colonel Xiang Pei at the Corps Club the night before last at 6:30 pm. More than 90 people attended, including the captains and senior officers of the various corps affiliated to the corps. The chairman of the Officers' Association of the entire corps, Major Chen Shixia, the captain of the Chinese corps, presided over the meeting. Chen made a farewell speech on behalf of the captains of all the corps and presented a silver gift engraved with the signatures of the senior officers as a memento. The commander then stood up to thank him and returned a clock to the Officers' Association to express his reluctance. In his speech, the commander praised the spirit of serving the public and cooperating for public security by eliminating national prejudices among all members of the corps. The meeting ended at 8:30 pm with everyone happily dispersing.

### Election of the Public Works Department Board; American Candidates Confirmed; Japanese Residents to Campaign Next Week; Number Ratio to Maintain Current Status

The deadline for American residents in this city to nominate candidates for the American director of the Public Works Department is only one day away. However, the American Association has not received the names of other candidates besides the two already nominated, Aleman and Minstred. It is believed that the American residents may not nominate others again, so it may not be necessary to hold a primary election. It is reported that the Japanese residents in this city have begun preparations to nominate candidates for the next Japanese director of the Public Works Department. The details of the Japanese residents' election campaign are not yet known, but it is generally believed that the Japanese residents will formally launch their election campaign at the beginning of next week. As for the British residents, it is expected that they will follow the usual practice and hold a primary election for the British director candidates of the Public Works Department at the beginning of next week, but the details are unknown, and the names of the British director candidates are also not yet known. It is generally believed that the board election of the Public Works Department, which will be held on April 2nd and 3rd this year, will maintain its current status again, and the taxpayer's annual meeting will be held on April 17th. It is expected that the Japanese residents will follow the procedures of the past few years and nominate five Japanese director candidates, and the Western electors will maintain the current ratio of five British directors, two American directors, and two Japanese directors.

### Yue Zhiyou Appointed as Chinese Director of the French Concession Board; All Parties are Happy to Get the Right Person

Since Mr. Zhang Xiaolin was dismissed from the position of Chinese director of the French Concession Board of Directors, the position has not been filled. Now, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association has recommended Mr. Zhao Zhiyou to take over, and the French Consul General has formally hired him by letter. According to reports, Mr. Zhao is a member of the prestigious Yin Yi family. He studied in France from a young age and is an acquaintance of the current French authorities. After returning to China, he was engaged in politics for many years and has an excellent reputation. In recent years, he has retired to Shanghai and devoted himself to industrial and commercial undertakings and local public welfare, and he is highly respected by Chinese and foreign parties. All sectors are happy to have the right person take on the role of Chinese director this time.

### Cixi Purchases Grain Fund; Shanghai Lends 100,000

Cixi is purchasing 250 dan of grain from Ninghai. The grain purchase fund was previously decided by the County Grain Adjustment Committee, with the county raising 200,000 yuan and Shanghai raising 100,000 yuan. A telegram was sent to Mr. Qin Runqing, a charitable person from Cixi in Shanghai, requesting him to allocate the funds quickly. Mr. Qin replied in a telegram that Shanghai would lend 100,000 yuan and that Yong Ken Ye had been telegraphed to issue a receipt. The bank must send a person to Cixi to supervise. In addition, the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai allocated 60,000 yuan to relieve the famine in the county and assigned representatives to distribute the funds by district. (1) 10,000 yuan was allocated to the urban area, and another 20,000 yuan was raised by the representatives. All of the funds were used to set up porridge distribution. It was entrusted to Mr. Zhou Pin and Luo Shen Boying Dezi in the urban area's Ti Ren Shan Tang, starting on December 1st of last year. More than 1,200 people came to drink porridge every day. It is now planned to run until the end of June. The funds were claimed by Mr. Qin. (2) 10,000 yuan was allocated to the eastern township, which was claimed by Yao Lianfang, Qiu Baoxing, and Ge Weian. (3) 15,000 yuan was allocated to the southern township, which was claimed by Li Xiangfan. (4) 10,000 yuan was allocated to the western township, which was claimed by Yuan Mengqin.

### The Public Works Department Establishes a New Committee to Study Opening up New Tax Sources; Reviews the Authority of Donations and Taxes According to the Regulations; and Seeks to Expand the Scope of License Coverage for Various Industries

The Public Works Department recently approved the suggestion of the "Tax Revenue Research Sub-Committee" under the Economic Committee and decided to establish another sub-committee under the Finance Committee to be responsible for studying new tax sources to increase revenue. The committee's task is to study: (1) The situation of various industries that can be ordered to obtain licenses according to regulations but have not actually done so; (2) The scope of license coverage that can be expanded for various industries; (3) Entirely new tax sources. The members of the committee include Mr. Xi Yushu, Geddu, Hale, Liddell, Okamoto, and Saduq, all of whom are members of the "Tax Revenue Research Committee" under the Economic Committee. If the recommendations made by the new committee are adopted, they will do their best to promote their implementation. If various sectors wish to express their opinions on this issue, they can submit them in writing to Mr. Allen, the secretary of the committee. The final report of the Tax Revenue Research Sub-Committee is appended below.

Reconsidering the Tax Authority

(1) It is recommended to set up a new committee to explore new sources of revenue. The issues discussed in the first report of this committee only relate to the issue of increasing license fees. The reasons are: (A) The collection of license fees is clearly stipulated in the regulations, so that the Public Works Department and the taxpayers have this authority within a certain scope without doubt; (B) This committee believes that the Bureau urgently needs to increase revenue from the beginning of this year. According to the investigation, the donations and taxes currently collected by the Bureau are limited to land tax, house tax, advertising tax, license fees, wharf donations, and public utility franchise fees. The power granted to the Bureau to collect taxes by the land charter is absolutely limited to the collection of the above-mentioned donations and taxes due to its historical and customary interpretation, and has not been changed. Although this committee has never further reviewed the conventional interpretation of this layer in the land charter, it believes that the Bureau should not stick to old habits. For the sake of municipal finance, it is indeed necessary to expand the scope of donations and taxes. It is necessary to reconsider the scope of the authority granted to taxpayers by the land charter and the attached charters. Regarding the license fee layer, what this committee discussed only related to the various items currently collected in fact. The various industries that can be ordered to obtain licenses have been specifically listed in the regulations. It is well known that there are several other items that can be ordered to obtain licenses according to regulations but have never been implemented, as if the Bureau believes that it does not have this authority itself. This committee believes that the Bureau should immediately re-study and devise ways to expand the scope of license coverage for various industries. Based on the above, this committee recommends setting up another regular sub-committee under the Finance Committee to be responsible for studying the above-mentioned issues.

Improving the Organization of Donation and Tax Work

(2) Regarding the Donation and Tax Division of the Finance Department, the work of the Donation and Tax Division is quite complicated. Some of it is financial, such as collecting donations, estimating rent, and issuing licenses. The other part is not related to finance and involves the compilation of the list of electors, Bureau elections, and taxpayer meetings. This division was transferred from the General Office to the Finance Department in 1932. The important part of the reorganization plan had been completed before the war. Last year, nine donation collection branches were added in the urban area to facilitate donation services, and eleven Chinese inspectors were hired to replace foreign staff who performed the same duties. As a result, the results were good. Both working hours and travel expenses have been reduced. As far as the organization of the Donation and Tax Division is concerned, its efficient and economical operation is quite satisfactory.

### The French Veterans Association in China is Ordered to Reorganize

The French Shanghai Daily reported that the French Ambassador to China, Gossimer, recently received an order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of his country on January 22 and, in accordance with Article 5 of the decree promulgated on August 19, 1940, announced the dissolution of the Veterans Associations in China and reorganized them into the French Veterans Association, led by the local Consul General, Consul, or local chief officer, who is responsible for guiding. All deposits in the previous Veterans Association were transferred to the newly established small organizational committee, which is responsible for allocating and keeping them. The membership fee is limited to the use of relieving veterans.

### Japanese Troops Encountered Two Ambush Attacks Near Yangshupu Yesterday

Near a small river near Qiqihar Road and Pingliang Road in Yangshupu, at 1:05 pm yesterday, Ishii, a sergeant of the Shanghai Japanese Marine Corps, and Toda Masaichi, a private first class, were passing through the area when two young men followed them silently. They pulled out their guns from behind and fired. One bullet hit 武田正一's right cheek, penetrated his right chest, and he fell to the ground. Because the vital part was injured, he died on the spot. Another bullet hit Sergeant Ishii's right chest, and he also collapsed. Blood flowed like a spring.

Japanese Alert

After hearing the news, the nearby Japanese Marine Corps immediately dispatched a large number of armed Japanese soldiers to the scene of the incident to search in all directions. It is said that one of the shooters was captured. Afterwards, the Japanese Marine Corps Military Police, the Japanese Consulate Police, and Chinese and Western detectives from the Patrol Force rushed to the above-mentioned location to investigate and search, and imposed special martial law on the Pingliang Road area of Yangshupu, cutting off traffic, and the situation was tense. Except for the Japanese, no one was allowed to pass, and house-to-house searches were carried out. At the same time, all bridges over the Suzhou River leading to the central area of the concession, such as Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Zhabu Road Bridge, and Pentang Lane Bridge, were closed. After about two hours, the strict martial law was lifted and traffic was restored. It was impossible to find out where the injured Sergeant Ishii was sent for treatment for a while. It was reported that his injuries were serious.

Gunshots Last Night

At around 8:00 pm last night, near Weituoma Road and Yangzhou Road in Yangshupu, a Japanese Marine Corps soldier was suddenly shot twice by someone. It was not clear whether he was hit or where he was injured. The shooter fled into the crowd and disappeared.

### Temporary Interruption of Public Transportation in the French Concession

Around 2 PM the day before yesterday, workers in the machine room of the French Tramway Company in the French Concession suddenly went on strike, creating a very tense situation. To maintain order within the concession and prevent worker disturbances, the French police dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to be stationed at various roads and tram stations. However, since the drivers and ticket sellers in the machine room were not involved in the turmoil, the trams on various routes were still able to operate as usual. Unexpectedly, yesterday

3:50 PM

The trolleybuses on routes 17, 18, and 24 and the buses on routes 21 and 22 of the French Tramway Company suddenly went on strike during operation, causing vehicles to stop on various roads. Especially near Route Lafayette and Route Petain, more than ten buses were stranded. Most of the trolleybuses on routes 17 and 18 were concentrated near Nanyang Bridge, causing the public transportation in the French Concession to come to a complete standstill. It was not until 4:20 PM that the company authorities persuaded the workers to return to work, and the drivers and ticket sellers of various vehicles continued their work, allowing the vehicles on various routes to

operate as usual.

However, fearing incidents along the way, the trolleybuses and buses on all routes were driven in groups of three to prevent accidents. Regarding the sudden strike, a brawl involving dozens of new and old workers occurred in front of the tram company on Route Luban yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. More than ten people were detained at the time. The new workers were members of the "Labor Union." Simultaneously, fights between new and old workers were reported in various places. At 6:30 PM in the evening, similar struggles occurred in front of the Great World entertainment center, and one tram on Route 17 was also stoned by workers, causing damage and stopping service. At 6 PM last night,

Tram Drivers

and ticket sellers also went on strike, causing trams on various routes to suddenly stop service on Route Thibet and Avenue Joffre. Nearly a hundred trams were lined up in a long row in the middle of the road. After mediation by the company authorities and the police authorities, the situation returned to normal after half an hour.

### All Parties Pay Attention to People's Livelihood and Strive to Reverse the Trend of Rice Prices. Results Have Been Achieved, and Rice and Grain Must Be Sold Out Within a Time Limit. It Is Reported That a Large Amount of National Rice Will Arrive in Shanghai Within Days.

The Bean and Rice Industry and the Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes Industry Trade Associations jointly appointed Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and Fu Qiangeng last night to pay a visit to Mr. Hodekui, Deputy General Manager of the Public Concession's Public Works Department, and requested (1) to appoint personnel to join the rice industry investigators to thoroughly investigate the grain reserves in various rice and grain warehouses; (2) to telegraph the Hong Kong government to allow the normal export of rice and grain shipped to Shanghai to help the Shanghai people's livelihood. The authorities have already done so, and they have instructed to handle the various measures for the rice industry as discussed. It was also reported yesterday that hundreds of thousands of bags of national rice may be shipped to Shanghai at the end of this month or early October. If this is true, the price of rice may improve.

Time Limit for Clearing Warehouse Rice

The Concession authorities convened a meeting with rice industry leaders on December 9 last year to discuss ways to stabilize the rice market. It was resolved that from December 12 last year, a deposit of 5 Yuan must be paid for each bag of rice and grain after the transaction. If the payment is not made, it will be considered null and void, and the goods must be delivered and the full price paid within five days without delay. However, since the implementation of this measure, some unscrupulous rice merchants have still openly complied but secretly violated the rules, firmly hoarding goods and unwilling to sell them easily, resulting in a sharp reduction in the number of spot goods on the market, even to the point where there were no goods to meet the market demand. It has now been resolved by the Bean and Rice and Miscellaneous Grains Industries Trade Associations that all rice and grain transactions made before the 24th must be settled clearly before the 27th, otherwise, they will be sold separately and the deposit will be confiscated. The market has been publicly notified yesterday for all to know.

Brokers Postponed Entry to the Market

Due to the frequent rise in rice prices, there have been many complaints from the outside world about rice brokers. The Brokers Association has now notified its members to postpone entering the market during this chaotic rice market to avoid external criticism. Some members have accepted the advice, and although some members have entered the market, it is said that they have not brokered rice and grain. The association has also sent people to the market to monitor the actions of its members.

### Firmly Defend the Outer Bulwark of the Pacific; China Must Fight a Protracted War (3)

— Soong Tzu-wen

Serving as the head of the Army News Group, he openly stated that if there are no drastic changes in the world situation, there is very little hope of completely collapsing China's resistance. Colonel Mabuchi also earnestly warned the Japanese people not to be optimistic about the Tripartite Pact, because the international trend is not only not beneficial to Japan but also beneficial to Chongqing. Colonel Mabuchi, who is known for his directness, further stated that the current situation in China is extremely complex and cannot be understood with common sense alone. Japan is currently fighting Chiang Kai-shek's army, and even if it defeats it, it will not solve the Sino-Japanese War. The majority of people gathered under Chiang's banner are truly outstanding patriotic elements in China, and their backing is the United States, Britain, and other countries, all of whom want to maintain the original order in East Asia. Japan should fully recognize the efforts of the anti-Japanese camp in Chongqing.

Since 1493, when the Catholic Pope planned to divide the world outside of Europe between Spain and Portugal, the recent pacts of the Axis powers to divide spheres of influence can be called the most ambitious and complete attempt to divide the world. The most important area for Japan's share of the spoils is China and the South Pacific, including Annam, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Burma, and India, or even Australia and New Zealand. There are other rich spoils of war that greed could not have dreamed of. It is not easy for Japan to think of annexing and obtaining them, and it is especially difficult to break through the Singapore military port.

Singapore currently does not have the assistance of the British main fleet, and it is not an opponent of Japan to rely solely on the strength of the Australian and Dutch fleets, because Japan has the support of the army in addition to its entire naval and air forces. Some say that to attack Singapore, one should consider the formidable US fleet, but the Japanese believe that when their allied countries launch a large-scale attack on the British mainland, Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal, if Japan simultaneously attacks Singapore, the crisis in the Atlantic will increase, and the United States may ignore the fate of Singapore, which is also unknown.

Although the strength of the Japanese fleet and air force has been slightly damaged, the strength of the army cannot be concentrated to assist its great southward advance plan. According to estimates by neutral military experts, the number of Japanese troops killed in action, died of disease, and permanently lost combat power due to injuries in China is more than one million. In addition, there are 1.25 million people trapped in China, not including those in the three eastern provinces defending against Russia. However, the general opinion of military experts is that the economic law of diminishing returns makes it impossible for the Japanese to organize new troops to engage in new adventures. The reasonable step for the Japanese in this situation should be to withdraw their large troops and transport ships from China. In the past six months, China has repeatedly received requests for peace from Japan, and the conditions have gradually eased. The Japanese know that there is no hope of eliminating the Chinese army in the short term, but time is passing, and their southward advance plan cannot be delayed any longer. Then why not negotiate peace with China so that they can withdraw their troops to engage in the development of the South Pacific? If the adventure in Singapore succeeds, there will be unlimited resources of oil, rubber, tin, rice, cotton, etc. in hand, and by cutting off the Burma Road, they can slowly besiege China. Therefore, Japan is now giving China fairly generous peace terms, because after the fall of Singapore, all treaties signed with China will naturally lose their effectiveness.

These theories are extremely reasonable, but because they are reasonable, the Chinese also understand Japan extremely well. The withdrawal of a large army would temporarily give us a chance to breathe, but the fall of Singapore would be a great misfortune for China and extremely unfavorable to Britain, and even the United States would feel the same disadvantage. To make peace with the Japanese now is only a temporary truce, and the benefits are entirely on the Japanese side. The Sino-Japanese conflict is part of a global struggle, so China will only be able to enjoy lasting peace after the global war is resolved. We must continue to fight, not only to maintain our army's original positions but also to pressure the Japanese army so that it cannot withdraw its troops to plan for a southward advance. Since the start of the war, China has lost more than two million soldiers, but now China has a strong army of 2.5 million regular troops and countless guerrillas. From all aspects, the organization, strength, and experience of its army are far superior to what they were at the start of the war. On the Japanese side, the area of deployment is wide, the army is deployed without a clear purpose, discipline is lax, and morale is low. Therefore, if our country adopts a decisive offensive, it will surely achieve great results.

China has encountered two major difficulties in this war: a lack of financial resources and a lack of aircraft. The financial problem is very easy to understand. More than three years of war have caused considerable destruction, and the richest industrial areas have either been occupied or destroyed. Most of the transportation has been destroyed, and the transportation and supplies for millions of troops must be maintained. The value of the national currency in foreign exchange has fallen to one-fifth of its pre-war value, while domestic prices have risen to six times their pre-war level. Fortunately, the United States and Britain have opportunistically provided China with considerable assistance in terms of loans and credit. Recently, someone came from China and mentioned that President Roosevelt's declaration of lending China 100 million in loans has indeed had an encouraging impact in China. As a certain commentator said, this declaration is a new guarantee of ultimate victory for the oppressed Chinese people.

The aircraft problem is indeed not easy to solve. The United States, Britain, and other countries also feel the lack of aircraft, so this problem has attracted general attention. I intend to discuss it in more detail. The number of Chinese aircraft has never exceeded one-tenth of that of Japan. Although the strength is very different, fortunately, our country has a vast territory and countless airfields scattered everywhere. In the inland war, we can get the help of loyal villagers. Coupled with the daredevil courage of our air force, we have been able to maintain resistance for three years, shooting down twice as many Japanese planes as we have lost. Until September last year, the situation changed. From that time on, the Japanese changed to using more efficient aircraft, so in addition to quantity, their quality was also superior to our aircraft, and it became more difficult for our aircraft to take off and resist.

People around the world are also accustomed to seeing the tragic situation of indiscriminate bombing of British towns, but the British at least have anti-aircraft guns, balloon nets, and fighter planes to repel them, and they have bombers for retaliation. In China today, we only see Japanese planes leisurely flying over towns, selecting targets, and safely dropping bombs without encountering resistance or the danger of retaliation. On May 3 and 4, 1939, Japanese planes heavily bombed the civilians of Chongqing, and the number of people who died from bombing and burning was about 10,000, which was more than the total number of deaths and injuries from the heavy bombing of London in six months.

The democratic countries' need for aircraft is indeed difficult, but China still has reasons to insist on the supply of aircraft. Our country has wiped out more than one million Japanese troops in a long war of attrition, and has also contained 1.25 million troops, preventing them from being used to assist their allies, Germany and Italy. China's war, in the past and in the future, has been beneficial to the democratic countries. The allocation of aircraft must also be weighed and compared in terms of quantity. In the Battle of Britain, the number of aircraft needed should be counted in the thousands or even tens of thousands. In China, a relatively small number of aircraft can create miracles, encourage morale, and assist the army in combat.

The Japanese are good at writing and ink, and it is rare to find their peers. Millions have been killed and injured in the Sino-Japanese conflict, and millions more are in combat, but they call it an accidental event and call it the "China Incident." The United States may maintain a neutral country status in this world war, but no matter how Americans praise us, we now firmly defend the outer bulwark of the American Pacific, and we regard ourselves as a partner of the United States. Since I came to the United States, I have felt the deep friendship of the people of this country for China everywhere. I think this is not only sympathy for the victims of aggression, not only recognition of our country's brave fighting, but I think there is something deeper than this in history, that is, a kind of natural and deep feeling that China is a great nation that can be trusted. At this time, we are fighting to prevent the war from spreading to the United States. If this nation can overcome this difficulty, it will surely be able to cooperate with the United States as a son of the United States to maintain the security of the Pacific. With God's blessing and your help, we will surely be able to achieve our wish.

### Yuan Chang Yarn Firm Forged Japanese Merchant Warehouse Receipts, Three Accomplices Arrested, the Principal Offender Is at Large, Fraudulent Funds of 500,000-600,000 Yuan, Bank Stopped Payment

Yuan Chang Yarn Firm, located at No. 6, Lane 457, Ningbo Road, was opened by Jin Zhonghou. Recently, the firm accepted a large number of orders from peers. After collecting the deposit or payment for the goods, it issued warehouse receipts from Yu Feng Yarn Factory. Ruichangxing Cotton Cloth Firm, which shared the same building as Yuanchang, had issued more than 25,000 yuan in checks from Zikangzhuang, etc., to Yuanchang and was given

Yu Feng Warehouse Receipts

Several receipts. Ruichangxing discovered that the words "Unified Tax" on the receipts were reversed, which aroused suspicion. While inquiring with Yuanchang, it also instructed an apprentice to check with Yu Feng Factory the day before yesterday. The Japanese at the factory discovered that the receipts were forged. The Japanese reported this to the Central Police Station. Chinese Detective Yang Peiniu, Detective Wu Chunrong, and Detective Zhu Wanjun rushed to Yuanchang, arresting Wang Yating, Pan Zheru, and Li Guoqing, three people. They confiscated

More Than 30 Forged Receipts

and more than 90 yuan in cash. They also went to Room 509 of the Jinmen Hotel but failed to arrest Jin Zhonghou. They confiscated dozens of seals and found that Yuanchang had collected a total of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan from other customers. However, what the customers had paid were banker's drafts due on the 24th. The detectives immediately went to various banks and money houses to stop payment. According to the statements of the banks and money houses, because they were all banker's drafts, they could not stop payment without a court order, so

the police requested

that they temporarily withhold payment until 3:00 PM tomorrow (i.e., yesterday) to await the court's order. Yesterday morning, the police sent the three arrested suspects to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the process and requested that a stop-payment order be issued. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered that the three suspects, including Wang, be detained for one week. The police's request for a stop-payment order was approved.

### Truth About the Attack on Dr. Shen Jian'an. He Was Discharged from the Hospital Yesterday After Recovering.

It is learned that Dr. Shen Jian'an, a doctor who studied in Japan, and his Japanese wife, Zhuzi, were attacked and injured at their clinic at No. 50, Mauris New Village, Lane 429, Race Course Road at around 10:00 AM on the 21st. Shen's facial injuries have healed, and he was discharged from the hospital and returned home yesterday morning. However, his wife's injuries are still serious, but after surgery, her life may not be in danger. Yesterday, Dr. Shen sent a letter detailing the truth of the case as follows:

On Friday, the 21st of this month, at about 10:00 AM, two people came to the clinic seeking treatment. One had stubborn ringworm, and the other had trachoma. I followed the usual procedure of registering them and they voluntarily reported their surname as Wang on the examination slip. After the doctor applied the medicine and so on, they left. The next day (i.e., the 22nd), Saturday morning, the person with trachoma came with another person. After I greeted them and asked them to sit down, the person named Wang came with another person wearing a suit. As soon as they reached the entrance of the consultation room, the person in the suit pulled out a pistol and told us not to make a sound. I realized they were robbers and told them that if they wanted anything, they were welcome to take it. The robber wanted the diamond ring that my wife, Zhuzi, was wearing on her finger. Because the ring was too tight, she couldn't take it off. After a moment of struggle, the three people wearing Chinese clothing left hurriedly and fled downstairs. At this time, the robber in the suit shouted to them, "Don't go!" Seeing that the robber was alone and losing ground, I bravely embraced him from behind. My wife screamed for help. Fearing things would go wrong, the robber struggled and fired a shot at me, then turned around and fired another shot at my face. At this point, I lost consciousness and let go. The robber took the opportunity to escape downstairs. Afterwards, I was taken to Fumin Hospital by ambulance for treatment. I went to Fumin Hospital because I was sent there in the ambulance for treatment, and also because my wife, Zhuzi, was seriously injured and needed someone to accompany her. Now that I see the facts in the newspaper are untrue, and also because I have been practicing medicine in Shanghai since returning from studying in Dongying (Japan), striving for further study in medicine, and have no political connections whatsoever, I am recounting the process as above to clarify the truth so that I can live without shame. Shen Jian'an, February 25. He committed suicide because of this.

### Once Well-Fed and Well-Clothed, He Ended Up as a Beggar in Chongqing. He Used to Work as a Pattern Maker for a Foreign Company's Construction Project, Became Addicted to Drugs, Was Dismissed, Expelled from His Home, and Died of Illness on the Street.

Lu Xiaomao from Shaoxing, 23 years old this year, used to work as a pattern maker for a foreign company's construction project. His income was quite high. He had an elderly mother, Lu Zhang, in her sixties, and a wife and three children. Their life was comfortable. However, Lu made bad friends and became addicted to opium. When the foreman in the company found out, he was dismissed. Instead of improving himself, he willingly fell into depravity and switched to taking the drug heroin. When he ran out of money, he even stole clothes from his house and sold them to support his addiction. His mother and wife were unable to prevent him and could not bear his burden, so he was expelled by his mother and wife and not allowed to return home. The family's livelihood was taken care of by relatives. Lu's situation reached the point where he was destitute. He begged during the day and stayed in opium dens or alleys at night. For a year, he suffered from hunger and cold. He became ill a few days ago. He had been staying in a heroin den in Ruifu Lane, Zilaishui Street. Because his illness became more serious, he was kicked out by the den owner and slept on the street at the foot of the wall at the entrance of Ruifu Lane, Dongzilaishui Street. Unable to withstand the wind and rain, he died on the morning of the 24th. The police notified the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall to collect the body. Then his fellow beggars notified his family. Yesterday, the deceased's mother and wife went to the hall to identify the body in tears and took it back for burial. It is truly lamentable that such a talented person who was well-versed in Chinese and Western knowledge was harmed by opium and heroin and ended up in such a way.

### Paint Merchant Wang Zuolin Escapes Danger Yesterday

According to the Social News Agency, Wang Zuolin from Wuxi, owner of the Fuchang Paint Store at No. 182, Route Foch, 59 years old, was kidnapped alone by five bandits on the morning of January 5 this year when he, his son Zonggan, and his brother-in-law Xi Lusheng were driving his own car, No. 1936, from his residence via Route Foch and Rue de la Caserne. There was no news of him until now. It is now learned that Wang escaped danger yesterday. It is reported that after Wang was kidnapped, he was secretly hidden by the bandits on a hat-and-awning boat on the Wusong River in Zhabei for a long time. Yesterday, the "water police" received a tip and went to solve the case, arresting three bandits.

### Zhou Brothers' Parricide Case: Zhou Jing was Found Not Guilty. The Higher Second Court Retried the Case and Released Her in Court Yesterday.

In the sensational case of Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang brothers killing their father, Zhou Yongjie, after the police filed a complaint with the Special First District Court, Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang were sentenced to death, and their mother, Zhou Jing, was also sentenced to two years and six months in prison for assisting in the destruction of the body. The defendants refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. As a result, the appeal was rejected by the Higher Court. Zhou Jing, represented by lawyers Jiang Bao, Jiang Pingfan, Yang Linzhi, Yang Sicheng, Ye Shaoying, etc., appealed to the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court. Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang also filed appeals to the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court. After carefully reviewing the case files, the Supreme Court Branch determined that the Zhou brothers' guilt was clearly proven and could not be pardoned, so it rejected the appeal and upheld the death sentence. For Zhou Jing's part, it was believed that there were still doubts that required investigation, so the judgment was sent back to the Second Branch of the Higher Court for retrial. The case was brought up by the Second Branch of the Higher Court, and Zhou was still defended by lawyers Jiang and others. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Han, the Chief of the Criminal Court of the Second Branch of the Higher Court, along with two judges, Nie and Zhao, took the bench in the First Criminal Court. Zhou Jing was in court waiting for instructions, represented by lawyer Jiang Pingfan. Judge Zhou then announced the judgment, the main text of which was: The part of the original judgment concerning Zhou Jing is revoked; Zhou Jing is not guilty. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian declared in court that he would abandon the appeal, and Zhou Jing was released in court. This sensational case of moral decay came to an end.

### Dafang Hotel Robbed of 8,000 Yuan

They then searched the silver box and took more than 7,940 yuan in legal tender and 50 yuan in the hotel's vouchers before fleeing without a trace. Afterwards, the hotel reported the robbery to the police for investigation.

### Dart King

— Xiu Bi

Although it was the cold early spring, they were still shirtless.

One of them was the master, and the other two were disciples. The master was the father, and the disciples were the sons.

Every day, in two sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, they first laid out two rows of eighteen kinds of weapons on a piece of mud.

Then, the master pursed his lips: "Everyone! Everyone!"

"Look at the fists, the fists, look!" People formed a circle around them.

The master opened his mouth:

"Friends, what are you here to see today? Some friends say they are here to see Qian Yunbiao, the Dart King. Very well! Very well! I am Qian Yunbiao, the Dart King. Qian Yunbiao, the Dart King, is none other than this face of mine..."

"Today, I have brought two little disciples to display our family's unique skills, entirely for the purpose of helping the poor and relieving poverty, an open exhibition, with not a penny taken. If I were to take a penny from you all, may I be a bastard tortoise..."

The Dart King waved his hands, turned around, and the words he spoke also took a turn:

"However, although I don't want copper coins, I would like to ask you all to help me with a small favor, to promote some things. What things?"

"I won't say it yet, let me and my two little disciples first perform a set of 'goods' for you all to see!" After saying this, he retreated to the corner.

The two shirtless disciples, upon hearing these words, scurried onto the stage, practiced a fight, and then each chose a position, waving their hands and feet, and striking a "pose."

They hit each other, "crack, crack," making strange loud noises.

After the fight, they also performed a real sword-and-spear battle.

Amidst the applause, the Dart King then walked forward a few steps and bowed to the audience.

"Good! Good!" He humorously imitated the voices of the crowd, shouting: "But hold on, the main show hasn't started yet..."

What show? It turned out to be a dart performance.

One disciple squatted on the ground, holding a copper coin in his hand. The Dart King then took an iron dart with a long rope tied to it from the weapon rack.

"People say I am the Dart King, but I dare not claim that title." He tied the dart to his arm and bowed to the audience around him: "However, I have practiced this set of darts for over ten years... How to perform darts, the first is 'hitting objects in the palm,' the second is... oh, hold on..."

"Wait, today I really don't have a penny, my stomach is too empty, I can't get any strength, what to do!" The disciple began to sing a false tune.

"That's right, that's right." The master also chimed in: "Let's ask you all to help us out first!" So they took out a black package next to the weapon rack. They opened it, and inside it was full of black plasters.

The master first bragged about the plaster for a while.

"Today, we have to sell at least fifty of them."

"Forty should be enough!" The disciple added a supplement.

"Twenty then!" The master automatically reduced it by twenty more.

Among the audience, there were immediately people who wanted to buy them. Ten minutes later, only five plasters were left.

The dart performance then began...

First, the disciple squatted on the ground, with a copper coin in the palm of his hand. A dart flew, the copper coin fell, but the palm was unharmed, so the audience shouted "Bravo!"

Next, the copper coin was placed on top of the head. A dart flew, and the copper coin fell as before, the head unharmed, and they heard another shout of "Bravo!"

Finally, the copper coin was moved to the bridge of the nose, the dart flew, and also as before, they received shouts of praise.

But that wasn't rare enough. The Dart King's unique skill was also there, which was to irregularly wrap the rope around his body and tie knots. When he turned around, the knots untied themselves, and the dart flew out, hitting the copper coin without fail. This time the shouts of praise were even greater than before.

The Dart King then boasted to the audience with a smile on his face: "I'm not bragging! I, Qian Yunbiao, have been throwing darts like this every day for over ten years, and I have never once missed or made a mistake. This is all from my hard practice..."

But one day, it was the day before the heavy snowfall, the weather was particularly cold; the Dart King's shirtless body was shivering, and he was also hungry all day. When the dart flew out, his hand weakened, and it just happened to hit the bridge of the disciple's nose.

The disciple fainted on the spot, while there was a burst of wild laughter around him. That burst of wild laughter pierced the heart of this "King," and his face was both iron-green and pale...

From that day on, people could no longer find the Dart King's踪迹 on that empty space.

### "The Way"

— Shu Ying

Zhuangzi is recorded as Dongguo Zi asking Zhuangzi, "Where does the so-called Way reside?" Zhuangzi said, "It is everywhere... in tiles... in excrement and urine." It can be seen that Zhuangzi had great "foresight," and today, thousands of years later, it is truly "the Way is in excrement and urine"; not only "in," but also "overflowing"!

If "even thieves have their way," if "the Way also has thieves"; if "using the Way as theft," if "using theft as the Way"... yet despite the fact that everyone in the world "knows it like the back of their hand," it is still a case of "my Way is not lonely"!

There are many Ways, but even more people steal the Way. Now, as long as you donate a few dozen piculs of white rice and flaunt your "benevolence" in the newspaper; or sit in a fancy chair in some "association"... then you are completely a "person of the Way," and even the "robbed" cannot help but praise the "Way" with their mouths full!

"The Way is in excrement and urine"... ultimately: Is it the Way? Is it theft? Or is it stealing the Way?

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Before Zhao Si could finish speaking, Shen Mazi snorted through his nostrils, raised his right thumb, and sneered repeatedly:

"Old Brother, don't try to scare people with these young masters! Master Yuan Qi, is he Mr. Wu's father? You're singing, can he interfere? If he really likes keeping young female roles, why doesn't he just take Mr. Wu into his house?"

Zhao Si didn't expect this big gangster to say such outrageous things, and his face flushed red. Leaning against Begonia's bed, he was so angry that he kept shouting, "What kind of talk is this? What kind of talk is this?" Begonia himself was so angry that he turned green, but he didn't dare to offend this local tyrant.

"Are you talking, or farting?" Zhao Yukun gently stood up from the stool and looked Shen Mazi up and down.

Shen Mazi slid down from the table and was a full foot taller than Yukun.

"Hey kid! Who are you?" He pointed his thumb, almost directly at Yukun's face, and asked.

Yukun simply leaned his body slightly to the side, letting the thumb pass to the left.

"Are you asking me? My name is Zhao Yukun. Let me tell you! Shen, you invited him, whether the ticket sales are good or not, that's your own luck. What's the point of messing with him?"

Shen Mazi didn't expect that this young man with tattered clothes and a wretched appearance was Zhao Yukun, the martial clown who sang Shi Qian and Zhu Guangzu on stage every day, was very popular off stage, and was unexpectedly the fifth performer. He didn't want to offend him, but in front of Begonia and Zhao Si, he couldn't bring himself to back down. He had to keep his face green and say angrily:

"Whether the ticket sales are good or not depends on luck, of course, but his face is too tender to sing jokes, isn't that just being kept at home..." (40)

### The Poor Rob the Poor

— Guo Wenqiang

A Mao Gou's father walked home dejectedly, holding a basket in his left hand and clenching his fist tightly in his right. He ran up the stairs in one breath and rushed into the loft, causing the loft floor to creak. He threw the basket onto the bed, speaking in a loud voice, as if he were roaring:

"Damn it, bad luck, this is the third time!"

A Mao Gou and his mother saw him come back with an empty basket in his hand, and thought it was a happy thing. Didn't an empty basket mean that the basket of things they had just taken out had been completely exchanged for legal tender? However, when they heard the words "Damn it," they already knew something was wrong, especially since there was also the sentence "This is the third time." This really startled A Mao Gou's mother, and she quickly put down the children's clothing from Taixing Company that she was embroidering, paying attention to the basket on the bed.

"What's wrong this time?" She asked A Mao Gou's father.

A Mao Gou's father sat on the bed, so angry that he could barely breathe.

"What's wrong? Just look at the basket!" A Mao Gou's father spoke in a very heavy voice, and there was an echo in the loft.

"Could it be that it was robbed again?"

A Mao Gou was picking up the peanut candies on the bed, which had rolled out of the basket. A Mao Gou counted them, there were only nine big ones and some broken ones.

"It was that unkillable Biegui (a derogatory term for a poor person) again, he darted up from behind me, grabbed the basket in one hand and ran, stuffing peanut candies into his pocket as he ran." After a while, A Mao Gou's father said.

"Then why didn't you chase him? He deserves to die." She asked again, and her voice was also higher than before, obviously angry.

"Chase! Do you think I didn't chase him? Otherwise, this basket would have been taken away by this bastard too."

Every morning and noon, A Mao Gou's father always took a basket of peanut candies, and sometimes some five-spice beans, and stood in the school district, waiting for the students to come. For some reason, these days have been very unfavorable, for three days in a row, the peanut candies taken out to sell were either completely robbed or robbed of most of them.

"I heard that those Biegui have a gang. If they rob us like this every day, how can we survive? Let's sell in another place." A Mao Gou's mother was sobbing.

At this time, A Mao Gou wiped his tears with his sleeve, he looked at his father, then at his mother, and said slowly:

"Mom, they don't have food to eat, and we are often hungry too, why do they have to rob us? There are many rich people in Shanghai, why... do the poor rob the poor?..."

Strange, when his father heard A Mao Gou's words, his eyes also turned red.

### Lu Ming's Romance

— Shou Wu

Lu Ming, known as the "Dream Lover of Movie Fans," has been out of touch since she went to Hong Kong. It wasn't until recently that someone rumored that she had secretly come to Shanghai to join Yi Hua to film, but this was just a castle in the air, reflecting the eagerness of hope, and was actually completely "air."

A little earlier than this "secretly come to Shanghai to film" rumor, there was also a piece of news about Lu Ming, saying that she had fallen in love with Zhang Huoyou, a young actor from Nanyang Company, due to their filming of "Grievances of Women's Quarters," and that the two often went out to play, and seemed very intimate.

This news, looked like it was very serious. As the saying goes, "Which young girl doesn't cherish spring?" It is only natural for Lu Ming to fall in love with a young man at her age.

However, common sense is not an iron law. In a recent letter to a friend, Lu Ming confessed about this matter:

"My first film after joining Nanyang was "Grievances of Women's Quarters," the male lead was Zhang Huoyou. In the film, his name is 'Jimi'. After filming for a week, there was such a shocking piece of news in the company's promotional publication 'Film Land': Lu Ming and Zhang Huoyou are in love, and she calls him Jimi Jimi very intimately on the set! The content was about how we fell in love, but this is actually something that happened in the film. What's hateful is that they didn't explain that this was the plot. Although everyone knows that this is just a promotional article, some people think it is a fact... Not long after, I saw similar news in Shanghai publications, but it had already been changed. Not only did it say that we were in love, but also that we were often together, alas, this is really wronging me..."

Movie stars are "people," and falling in love is not surprising, but people always seem particularly interested in the love affairs of movie stars. So, Lu Ming's confession about this "love affair" should definitely interest some people, right?

### Hollywood Stars' Quirks When Filming

— Hui Lin

Olivia de Havilland doesn't like to use rouge on her face and lips before the camera, especially in the films she makes with Errol Flynn; she always sits quietly at home the day before filming, but not necessarily reading the script.

Mickey Rooney often runs into the studio from the factory gate, jumping and hopping, always carrying a small, all-black wiener dog with him; strangely enough, whenever Mickey goes to film any movie, this dog is always with him, and if he doesn't have the dog, Mickey's performance won't be good, because he's always thinking about it.

Henry Fonda, within hours of going on camera, although already in the makeup room, still recites his lines to himself and makes grand gestures, the situation is very realistic; people in the makeup room who like to joke often act with him, but Henry still pretends to be acting, making others embarrassed.

Chewing chocolate peanut brittle is Bette Davis's habit when filming, she often brings a box of candy to the set; at the same time, there are also several boxes of candy hidden in the company, originally sent by fans specifically for Bette, which she puts in the company, ready to take out and eat when filming.

Annabelle hates going to film on Friday mornings the most, because she thinks Friday mornings are the most unlucky time; she also likes to hum some songs in the makeup room to joke with the makeup staff. Annabelle is originally French, and is now Tyrone Power's wife, she has many habits, carrying an authentic Parisian flavor.

Spencer Tracy and George Brent both have a very good habit, which is to be very serious when filming, until the filming is finished.

Gary Cooper is the shyest star, he hates people visiting him when he's filming, if he has to, then he has to put on a very polite and courteous reception, making the guests uncomfortable.

### Tyrone Power's Love History - Loved Eight Women in Four Years

— Qing Hui

In Hollywood, no one can deny that Tyrone Power is a handsome and dashing, young and handsome man; he began mingling among women at the age of ten. After entering the film industry, he successively loved eight actresses in just four years; although he is now married to Annabelle, his past life can really be said to be very romantic. Now, let's talk about his love affairs:

Tyrone went on the screen at the age of twenty-two, initially playing a supporting role in French star Simone Simon's "Girls in Distress"; Simone liked him very much, and Tyrone's status was low at that time, so he was happy to socialize with the more famous actress, so he often accompanied Simone to travel, photograph, and swim; soon the two fell in love. Then, he successively co-starred in three films with Loretta Young, and the two had a very good friendship, often having parties, looking very close, and people said that they were a mature couple, but Loretta Young declared to the news reporters that he was just her best friend, and as for marriage, it was out of the question.

At this time, Sonja Henie began to become famous in Hollywood, Tyrone and she co-starred in a film, unexpectedly, during the production of the film, the two fell in love at the same time; this time it was an open love affair, dance floors, restaurants, skating rinks, his and her traces could be seen everywhere. It was once rumored that Tyrone had proposed to Sonja, but this was unconfirmed news. Later, Sonja went to various parts of the United States to perform ice skating, and when she separated from Tyrone, the two made a passionate kiss in front of the public. But soon news came from Hollywood that Tyrone had not only forgotten her, but was also in love with Janet Gaynor.

Tyrone's love affair with Janet was relatively long, and he and she always went to Hollywood parties together, and he and her were often seen dancing at the dance floor every Sunday. But when news reporters asked him when he would marry Janet, he always answered with career reasons. Later, for some unknown reason, the two quarreled, and although friends mediated, the cracks in their love could not be repaired. Janet had people who loved her, and Tyrone also began to pursue Fox's newcomer Arleen Whelan; however, he eventually gave up his ambition to pursue Arleen because of Arleen and Richard Greene's close relationship, and he was also a good friend of Richard, and didn't want to take the beauty of others.

Later, he was borrowed by MGM to play the male lead in "Marie Antoinette." Li Siliian Howard originally had the highest call for the role, but unexpectedly, Norma Shearer insisted on co-starring with Tyrone, which shows that Norma also had a good impression of Tyrone; in several passionate scenes in the film, her emotions can be seen. Perhaps because of the age difference, Tyrone said that he hoped that there would be no love affairs between the two. Therefore, their relationship also ended with the completion of "Marie Antoinette."

After leaving Norma Shearer, Tyrone began to fall in love with the new star Wendy Barrie, but it was very short-lived. Afterwards, the most important and memorable thing in his life came, originally Tyrone saw Annabelle and felt that this French actress was lively and lovely; before long, during the filming of "Suez," his life history began to change, he knew that he had met his ideal partner, and at the same time Annabelle also fell in love with him, so his and her love quickly got success; although the company repeatedly tried to prevent it, it was all in vain, and he and she finally got married on May 25, 1939.
