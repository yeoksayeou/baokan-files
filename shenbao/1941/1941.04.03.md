Chongqing, according to reliable sources, the government has decided to recall Guo Taiqi, the ambassador to the UK, to serve as the Foreign Minister, and to appoint Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui as the Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council. This decision has been approved by the Eighth Plenary Session. The Eighth Plenary Session, which concluded today, issued a declaration expressing gratitude for the aid from the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union, and guaranteeing that China will continue fighting until there are no Japanese soldiers left within Chinese territory and until the Japanese abandon their attempt to dominate East Asia. The plenary session also resolved to appoint Wu Tiecheng, the former mayor of Shanghai and the current head of the Overseas Department, as the Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, succeeding Ye Chucang, who resigned due to illness. Wu's position as head of the Overseas Department will be succeeded by Liu Weichi. As for the position of ambassador to the UK, Gu Weijun, a veteran Chinese diplomat currently serving as the ambassador to France, is the most highly favored candidate. The authorities neither confirmed nor denied this. The plenary session's declaration also stated that although China is facing an unprecedented war, it is still making every effort to improve itself in order to realize a democratic government. The government has decided to implement economic controls to protect the lives of ordinary people during wartime, and the consistency of orders and military discipline must also be strictly maintained. Official reports indicate that the Central Executive Committee made many resolutions to improve administration during its meeting. The Executive Yuan will add two departments, namely the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Commerce, to replace the current Foreign Trade Commission and the National Food Administration. The selection of new personnel has not yet been finalized, but they will be appointed soon. The three-year wartime construction plan will also be launched immediately, and the five-year plan for popular education will utilize the Chinese phonetic alphabet in order to popularize the national language. The Central Executive Committee also decided to allocate funds to implement this plan. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)

Chongqing, at the Eighth Plenary Session, the presidium of the two-day conference submitted a proposal from the Central Organization Department to expel Liu Yazi from the party in order to maintain party discipline. The proposal was approved by a vote of the entire body. The original proposal stated: "It has been found that Central Supervisory Committee member Liu Yazi, since leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong, has made various statements in publications and public speeches that slander the Central Committee and violate the interests of the country. Despite repeated requests, both direct and indirect, for him to come to Chongqing and work together to overcome the current difficulties, all efforts have been unsuccessful. Even after sending a telegram urging him to attend this plenary session, he has continued to wantonly denigrate the party, which is a serious violation of party discipline. Therefore, we specifically propose that he be expelled from the party in order to maintain party discipline." (Telegraph, 2nd)

Chongqing, since the opening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, there have been ten general meetings, one plenary discussion, and a total of thirteen review meetings by the Party Affairs, Political Affairs, Military Affairs, Economic Affairs, and Education groups. At each general meeting, resolutions were passed under the chairmanship of Committee Members Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Ding Weifen, Chen Guofu, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Kong Xiangxi, and Dai Chuanxian. President Chiang and all committee members attended on time. The first to eighth general meetings were devoted to listening to reports from the various departments of the Central Committee, the Three Principles of the People Youth League, the various departments and commissions of the National Government, the party headquarters and governments of various provinces and cities, and the party and government reports from various border provinces. This took up a great deal of time, as the purpose was to review the past and plan for the future, so that the resolutions made would be more practical and not merely empty rhetoric. The conference received more than ninety proposals, which were first carefully reviewed by various review committees before being submitted to the conference for discussion. As for the declaration of the conference, a drafting committee was formed, consisting of twelve members, including Dai Chuanxian, Kong Xiangxi, Gu Mengyu, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wang Shijie, Liang Hancao, Pan Gongzhan, Huang Luyi, and Hong Lanyou, convened by Sun Ke and Chen Bulei.

### Full Text of President Chiang's Address at the Eighth Plenary Session

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Currently, public opinion generally holds excessive concerns about China's current economic problems. In my observation, there is really nothing to worry about in China's economy. Some people are criticizing us, mocking us, believing that our Party is not working hard enough, is too slack, and even saying that we are corrupt and aging. We must acknowledge and accept all these criticisms. From today onwards, we must thoroughly reflect on ourselves in order to make up for our mistakes and strive for achievements. We must bring our revolutionary spirit to any undertaking, overcome all difficulties, and strive for continuous progress. If we can catch up quickly, I believe it will not be difficult to solve the current economic crisis. Everyone must know that this plenary session is taking place at a time when the work of national construction is truly beginning. We really have the responsibility to build on the past and lead the construction of the nation. If we cannot establish a spirit of national construction, if we cannot inspire all Party members and the people of the whole country to work together to build the nation, then our sacrifices and efforts of the past three years will truly be wasted. However, observing the past three years and eight months, especially in the last six months, our spirit of struggle has indeed been declining day by day. From the Party to the government, from our central authorities to the local levels, all kinds of undertakings, whether Party affairs, politics, national economy, lack a new spirit and new economic power. I believe that this is a huge crisis. We cannot attribute this responsibility to the government, nor can we attribute it to the people. We cannot attribute it to the harsh internal and external environment, but to the leading Party that is resisting and building the nation, especially to the comrades of the Central Committee who are present today. We should never forget the teachings of "The revolution has not yet succeeded." If we, the hundreds of comrades who are present today, can all be united and invigorated, and still display our powerful spirit as we did more than three years ago, then finally

Speaking of Party Affairs

and the government, these are the foundation of our revolution. Everyone must know that the fundamental problem at present is to make politics have a new atmosphere and Party affairs have a new spirit. We must complete national construction in the future from a new politics, but to get politics on track, we must first seek the soundness of our Party. Therefore, I would like to say a few simple words to all comrades today, especially regarding Party affairs. We must have a clear understanding of the current international environment and domestic situation, as well as the Party's position. We must know that the Party's position in China is different from that of ruling parties with a considerable foundation in other countries, such as the National Socialist Party of Germany, the Fascist Party of Italy, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We are still in the revolutionary period, and all our Party members must work hard in the most basic and practical ways, especially from the grassroots and in social work. We are not afraid that the Party's power will not be strong, nor are we afraid that China's politics will not be sound, but only afraid that our Party will be isolated from society, so that our politics cannot establish a widespread and deep foundation. We

became party members, and a few became Central Committee members, certainly to shoulder the revolutionary duty, not for high office and great wealth, or to demand personal power and position. Not only that, but we, as Central Committee members, must always listen to public opinion, so we must serve society and do our best to fulfill our duties, truly being able to connect with the masses. Because whichever committee member, if he can work hard in the most basic undertakings in politics or society, and serve in the places closest to the people, is the most proper way for us to devote ourselves to the revolution, and then we will be worthy of being true revolutionary party members. If the foundation of our Party is not yet solid, and the Party's beliefs have not yet been established, and the general comrades think that we should have a special status and should enjoy special rights, this is completely wrong. You must know that the revolution has not yet succeeded, the principles have not yet been realized, our shame has not been wiped away, and our responsibilities have not been fulfilled. In the future, to invigorate the hearts of the people of the whole country, the responsibility lies entirely with this Party, entirely with our general Central Committee members. To establish the foundation of the Party, the responsibility also lies entirely with the cadres at all levels of this Party, and entirely with our general Central Committee members. The Premier has given us detailed instructions and arrangements for all our revolutionary undertakings, plans, and efforts in his entire will. As long as we recognize our own

responsibilities

and earnestly follow the teachings of the Premier, then all our services to society will be fulfilling all the responsibilities of party members, and establishing all the foundations of society for this Party. As long as we never fear hardship and go deep into society and get close to the people, so that the foundation of this Party in society becomes increasingly solid, then our great cause of revolutionary nation-building can be quickly successful. Therefore, our plenary session should have a practical resolution on the Party members' participation in local politics and social service work, so that this time

after the meeting

, the organization, spirit, discipline, and morality of our Party can be further enriched, actively improved, and have a new reform, in order to create a new atmosphere, so that we can truly shoulder the responsibility of our revolutionary nation-building. What I have said above are just a few simple reminders, but they are really the most important keys to the success or failure of our revolution. I hope that all comrades will concentrate on studying and discussing these issues during this plenary session, in order to complete the mission of continuing the past and opening up the future that this plenary session is responsible for.

Editorial

### The Issue of Seats on the Shanghai Municipal Council

The election of the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been the subject of intense discussion for months. The matter was first addressed the night before last when the Secretary-General of the Council, Mr. Fessenden, issued a statement. He said that the issue had been the subject of negotiations between the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, and the "greatest interests" of the Shanghai International Settlement. It was agreed to suggest to the Consular Body and the Chinese government that the original number of seats on the board of directors be changed to four Chinese, three British, three American and Japanese each, one German, and two from other countries for a certain period of time. This change not only breaks the precedent of a gentleman's agreement that has been in place for ten years, but also conflicts with the provisions of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations regarding the number of seats on the board of directors. How this will affect the future of the Settlement's administration is a matter of common concern to the millions of residents and related countries.

The proposal to change the number of seats on the Council dates back to 1936 and was initiated by the Japanese side. However, it has not been successful for several years. When the list of candidates was submitted last spring, the Japanese side took the lead in changing the past practice, increasing the number of candidates from two to five, and at the same time making every effort to campaign. A very tense situation ensued. However, as a result of the public will of the vast majority of voters, the original allocation of five British, two Japanese, and two American seats was maintained with only minor changes. At that time, the Japanese community had already stepped up preparations for the coming year. This year, the surface competition was not intense at first. However, there have been frequent back-channel contacts for a long time. As the list was delayed and the election period was repeatedly postponed, the residents felt a subtle unease in the midst of a precarious environment. According to the results of the negotiations disclosed the night before last, the number of seats on the board of directors has been completely changed. In addition to the total number increasing from fourteen to eighteen, the allocation of nationalities has been reduced by one for the Chinese, two for the British, and the Japanese desire to increase their number of directors by one has been met. At the same time, the number of American directors has also been increased by one, and a total of three directors have been added from Germany and other countries. It is rumored that the compromise process lasted nearly a month before this result was achieved. It is conceivable that the parties involved went to great lengths, and Mr. Fessenden's tactful statement is sufficient to show one aspect of his painstaking efforts. Considering the current situation, the administrative organization of the Shanghai Settlement should not be changed lightly, even Mr. Fessenden does not deny this. Is this change more beneficial or harmful than the "possibility of disputes and conflicts arising from holding elections"? And after the change, will we obtain, as Mr. Fessenden said, "a more comfortable atmosphere" and make some "urgent and important issues easier to deal with"? This is something that everyone cannot help but reserve their greatest doubts about.

The cause for concern about the future situation lies not only in the change in the proportion of seats on the board of directors, but also in the fact that once the legal barrier is breached, it will inevitably lead to more coveting and trouble in the future. What the Japanese side is fighting for is only the number of seats on the surface, but its intention is actually to control administrative and management power, and the increase in the number of directors is just the first step in this attempt to control. How the future of the Settlement will evolve still depends on how various factors develop in the future, and it cannot be hastily concluded that the change in the number of seats on the board of directors will have any decisive effect on the Settlement. However, unless there are special measures to prevent the brewing of various further developments in the future, the preservation of the current status of the Settlement will become even more difficult. Even from the perspective of the Shanghai Municipal Council itself, after this change, there will be several new problems arising: With regard to the current proportion of seats for foreign directors, the United Kingdom and the United States have a total of six directors, while Japan has three and Germany has one. Compared with the previous situation of the United Kingdom and the United States having seven and Japan having two, the increase and decrease in the ratio is subtly meaningful, this is one. The nationality of the other two directors has not yet been specified, but the Japanese side will definitely make every effort to obtain their assistance as much as possible, and a situation that can counterbalance the United Kingdom and the United States may therefore arise; it is rumored that Mr. Whitler, a Swiss national who previously published the so-called "Shanghai Reform Plan" and was the protagonist of a certain case, has become the target of the Japanese side, this is two. The number of Chinese directors has been reduced from five to four, and whether or not it can obtain the consent of the Chinese government is still a major question, and the position of these fewer Chinese directors will likely become an even more important target, and the situation of the Chinese directors themselves will become increasingly difficult, this is three. The position of Chairman is of great importance. In addition to his various powers, according to regulations, whenever the number of votes on both sides is equal during a meeting, the decision will be made by the Chairman's vote; now the number of seats for the United Kingdom and the United States is only equal to half of the total number of directors other than the Chinese directors, and the Chairman's position can actually influence the trend of the board of directors, this is four.

How to stabilize Shanghai is the common request of millions of residents here, both Chinese and foreign. The change in the number of seats on the board of directors violates the will of the vast majority of residents and the request to maintain the status quo of Shanghai, and it also goes against the consistent policy of the Chinese, British, and American authorities of not allowing changes to the status quo of Shanghai. Whether in terms of legal principles or in terms of facts, it cannot but be regarded as a major regret. Now the relevant countries will make various considerations and decisions on this, which is worthy of attention.

### Yugoslav National Unity – Safeguarding Independence and Integrity

London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the policy adopted by the new Yugoslav government is clearly to maintain peace and maintain close friendly relations with all neighboring countries, while focusing on maintaining its political independence and territorial integrity. Although the Tripartite Pact has not yet been abandoned, it is being studied very carefully. If the terms of the pact conflict with Yugoslavia's policy, the new government may declare the signature of the former Prime Minister invalid. However, the German side obviously does not want to listen to Yugoslav Prime Minister Simović's explanation of this pact. Given the repeated statements of the Axis powers, the Axis does not allow neutrality. A country is either a member of the Axis or against the Axis, there is no such thing as neutrality. Therefore, Germany's attitude towards Yugoslavia will force Yugoslavia to succumb to the Axis or face the consequences of refusal. The German propaganda against Yugoslavia is now the same as that used by Germany before it seized Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. While this is noteworthy, what Germany must now deal with is a government that has risen to power amid popular resentment against slavery. It is unlikely that the German side will be able to divide the three nations of Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia. Croats have always favored democracy and opposed dictatorship, and the recent military victories of the Allied powers and the attitude of the United States have revived public opinion in the Balkans.

(Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)

Yugoslavia - Sources in Zagreb said yesterday that Italy, in an effort to avoid war with Yugoslavia, wants to mediate the German-Yugoslav dispute. Recent developments have made all Balkan countries nervous, and Germany is even more impatient with Yugoslavia. According to informed sources, the mediation plan is for the Yugoslav government to send a letter to Mussolini asking him to mediate, but reliable Yugoslav sources say that there was no concrete realization of this matter until the last hour of last night. The Croatian Peasant Party of Yugoslavia held a day-long meeting yesterday, and the party's vice chairman, Maček, told newspaper editors that Croatia would henceforth leave three leaders to reside in the capital, so Italy's desire to avoid the losses of war by proposing mediation coincides with the Croatian leaders' residing in the capital.

### British Planes Night Raid Emden – Use Giant Bombs – Unparalleled Bombing – British Clacton-on-Sea Area – 2,000 Killed and Injured in Air Raid Last Month

London - The terrible destruction suffered by Emden, a German industrial center, during a British air force night raid on Monday, can be seen in the report of the British Air Ministry Intelligence Department. According to the report, the bombs carried by British planes in the night raid were enormous and incredibly powerful, unlike the ordinary bombs used by British and German air forces. The first British plane to arrive in Emden dropped a batch of incendiary bombs, causing three fires in the center of the city. The fires illuminated the streets, making them an ideal target for central aircraft to drop bombs. Its observers said that as soon as a giant bomb fell, a flash of white light was seen, and fragments flew high into the air. Apparently ordinary rubble fragments proved that it had been seriously damaged, and the fragments flew high and fell for a long time, indicating that the explosive power was strong. Another observer said that the bomb fell as if an entire house had been blown into the air. According to a driver who had been to 30 attacks, the giant bomb emitted an unprecedentedly huge flash of light when it fell, dazzling his eyes. As the British plane hovered over the city and was about to leave, it saw the fire burning more and more fiercely. The German side was also impressed by the power of the British planes, so its communique acknowledged that "the houses suffered relatively serious damage." (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)

London - Interior Minister Morrison said in response to a question in the House of Commons yesterday that 1,100 people were killed and 1,000 seriously injured in the German air raid on the Clacton-on-Sea area on March 13 and 14. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)

### Collapse of the Italian East African Empire Not Far Off – Capital of Eritrea Falls – Red Sea Port of Massawa Threatened

Cairo - Last night, officials here announced that the British Imperial Army had captured Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. After the British troops entered the city, a representative of the civil administration, accompanied by an Italian officer carrying a white flag, went to the British military headquarters in the car and surrendered the city. From Keren to Asmara, the roads were littered with abandoned firearms, ammunition, clothing, and food, which showed the panic of the Italian troops retreating. After the British troops captured Keren, with the assistance of the air force, they pursued and suppressed the Italian troops who had lost their will to fight. In just five days, they advanced 75 miles and achieved a great victory. Now they have opened the way to directly take Massawa (the last Italian port on the Red Sea), the Italian military base 55 miles away. Once this port is captured, the Eritrean campaign can be concluded. The British troops spent a great deal of effort in attacking Keren. In the harsh conditions of the country's weather and rugged mountains, they launched a fierce attack for two weeks before capturing it last Thursday. However, the army did not rest, and continued to pursue. The land they passed through was steep, making it difficult for the army to march. After only five days, they captured Asmara again. The advance can be described as rapid. Now that Asmara has fallen, the problem of protecting the safety of non-combatant Italians (including women and children) encountered by Italian Commander Ostellani is becoming increasingly difficult. The British troops' capture of the Eritrean capital not only poses a direct threat to Massawa, 75 miles away, but will also eventually cut off all traffic between Abyssinia and Massawa. At that time, Abyssinia's connection with the Red Sea will only be possible through Assab. Asmara is located on a plateau 7,600 feet above sea level and has a population of 100,000, half of whom are Italians. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)

### Italian Troops in Albania Trapped

Vichy - The Italian troops who withdrew from Harrar and Dire Dawa are reported to have used the French railway to flee towards Addis Ababa, and have caused considerable damage to the railway to prevent the British troops from pursuing them. The Italian troops destroyed the property in their second grain storage center, Dire Dawa. Dire Dawa was once the terminus of the railway, and the Italian high command had changed the use of the place as one of the grain storage centers, with its importance second only to Addis Ababa. According to reliable sources here, the station and other railway buildings are full of grain, ammunition, and gasoline. The Italian troops' withdrawal from the area is actually a loss of the most valuable air force base in the center of Albania. The area has now been used by the British Air Force. The Italian troops in Abyssinia have now been isolated from the rest of the world for 48 hours. They now have no way to open up reinforcements. They are now in a state of encirclement, and their military situation will be further complicated by the disturbance of the natives who have not been completely conquered in the area. (United Press Dispatch, 2nd)

### Italian Regime Controlled by Nazis

Boston - Davis, the Rome correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor, has returned here after being expelled by the Italian authorities. It is said that since the British defeated the Italian troops in Africa and the Mediterranean, the domestic regime in Italy has been almost completely under Nazi control. At present, the power in Italy is not in the hands of the military, as most people imagine, but is actually in the hands of the German secret police. This change had already occurred when I left Italy in late February. The Germans have a good chance of winning, because they are carrying out their plans very secretly. Most Italians are still in the dark. The infiltration of German forces into Italy had already shown signs before Italy joined the war. The German secret police seized the opportunity of the Italian military collapse and gradually realized their plan. (Omitted) Mussolini knows this, but there is no way to save it. Mussolini is now Germany's best friend in Italy and still hopes that the final victory of the Nazis will be his only chance of self-salvation. The current situation is not that Mussolini's regime has come to an end, but that the Nazis hold the real power. As far as the German side is concerned, Mussolini's continued stay in power is not much different from their direct occupation. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)

### British Far East Commander-in-Chief, Brooke-Popham, Arrives in Manila, Meets with US Asiatic Fleet Commander for Closer Cooperation on Far East Defense

Manila - It was learned tonight that British Far East Commander-in-Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham arrived at Cavite today by seaplane from Singapore and met with US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hart for three hours. Officials said that Marshal Brooke-Popham's arrival here was merely a ceremonial visit, but reliable sources claim that the Navy attaches great importance to this meeting because of increased Anglo-American cooperation in the Far East. It is understood that the US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, also returned to Manila urgently to attend the meeting. After a long talk with Brooke-Popham, Admiral Hart told reporters, "Marshal Brooke-Popham is not visiting me, so I cannot comment on his arrival here or the arrival of other guests." The British consul here said that Brooke-Popham's trip was not official. Brooke-Popham's Chief of Staff, fear, and other senior officials, as well as US naval officers, all declined to comment on this meeting, but they all unofficially acknowledged the importance of this meeting. Authoritative sources pointed out that there was no need to stop in Manila on the flight from Singapore to Hong Kong. Observers here say that this visit is a continuation of the war of nerves to show Japan the unity of Britain and the United States. (Reuters, 2nd)

Manila - Far East Commander-in-Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham visited US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hart today for consultations. The Navy attaches great importance to this consultation because of increased Anglo-American cooperation in the Far East, but British officials do not want to overemphasize this visit and consultation. They claimed that this visit was a routine customary visit between the British Far East Commander-in-Chief and the US Far East Commander-in-Chief. Marshal Brooke-Popham, his Chief of Staff, and other senior officials from Singapore to Hong Kong arrived in Cavite today on a Four-engine British seaplane, marking the first time in history that a British commercial or military aircraft has landed in Manila. British officials will leave here for Hong Kong on Thursday or Friday. The US Navy will try to allow the aircraft to land in Cavite. Welcoming him was Hart's adjutant. Authoritative sources claimed that the British Commander-in-Chief had met with Dutch East Indies officials in Batavia before coming to Manila. Therefore, it is expected that the Anglo-American Far East Commander-in-Chief's consultations will include all of Far East defense, because of Anglo-American-Dutch cooperation, and Marshal Brooke-Popham has completed his inspection of all British defenses in the Far East.

### Anglo-American Shipping Negotiations in Progress, Blockade Policy Not Relaxed

London - Reuters Parliamentary Correspondent has learned that Anglo-American representatives are currently discussing the British blockade policy in Washington. The British government has no intention of relaxing its general blockade policy. It is reported that Germany is greatly affected by the British blockade and is currently experiencing a severe shortage of rubber, copper, nickel, wool, and raw materials. Although Germany produces synthetic oil and imports oil from Romania and the Soviet Union, its oil reserves are dwindling. If German refineries and synthetic oil factories continue to be heavily bombed, and the eastern Mediterranean remains dominated by the British Navy, Germany will face serious oil supply difficulties by the end of this year. (Reuters, 2nd)

Ottawa - British High Commissioner to Canada MacDonald arrived in Canada on Tuesday.

### US Officially Announces Guardianship of French Merchant Ships, Rejection of German-Italian Demands Expected, South America Also Detains Axis Vessels

Washington - Germany and Italy have demanded that the United States immediately release the Axis ships and sailors it has detained. At the same time, according to the State Department, 25 of the 28 Italian ships detained have been damaged by saboteurs, and one of the two German ships detained has also been damaged. A senior Treasury official also stated that the United States has placed 19 French merchant ships under guardianship, including the "Normandie," the world's second-largest ship at 83,423 tons. Well-informed circles believe this is a prelude to seizure. It is understood that Germany and Italy's reason for demanding the release of the detained ships is that there is no provision for such guardianship in international law, and there is no explicit provision in US law. At the same time, officials stated that this detention may be a prelude to requisitioning ships to serve in the US merchant marine. This belief is now deepening, and the United States has shown in various ways that it will disregard German and Italian protests and continue to take action against the detained sailors. Secretary of State Hull stated that he has not yet studied the German and Italian demands, and has not even decided whether the State Department should respond. He also stated that this demand will not be published for the time being. Hull also said that Italy has not responded to the US request to close the Italian consulates in Newark and Detroit. Hull declined to discuss what actions might follow. Hull said that since the United States took guardianship action, the sinking or burning of Axis ships off the coast of Latin America has fully demonstrated the US attitude. (AP, 2nd)

Washington - The United States began prosecuting German and Italian sailors yesterday for attempting to sabotage Axis ships in US ports. The US takeover of ships has aroused repercussions in European countries.

Berlin - A Havas correspondent learned from well-informed sources that the German government will issue a statement in the near future regarding the confiscation of German ships in North American ports. (Havas, 2nd)

Berlin - An authoritative source stated yesterday that the US seizure of German and Italian ships was an "absolute violation of human rights." It is wrong for the US to try to justify the takeover as just based on this. The source also stated that there was no news of Germany and Italy demanding the release of ships and sailors from the US. (AP, 2nd)

### Peruvian Warships Pursue German Ships

### German Warships Lie in Wait, Attempt to Escort

Buenos Aires, Argentina - The 26 German and Italian ships docked in Argentine ports were yesterday under "special guard." The government authorities may take them over, but the authorities are also considering other measures and do not intend to detain them immediately. (International, 2nd)

Buenos Aires, Argentina - It is believed that three or four German warships are gathering in the South Atlantic, intending to act as an escort fleet for Axis ships escaping from US ports.

However, it is said that the conversation mainly focused on the issues of the United States and Yugoslavia. (AP, 2nd)

New York - Great commentators Kressel and Philin-Mus stated yesterday that the United States is racing against the war and may resort to force in 60 days. The United States must escort and transport goods to supply Britain. Germany will inevitably attack the ships. The United States is now taking a path that is not conducive to war, and its effect can greatly reduce the amount of bloodshed. Well-informed sources believe that the United States will escort goods to Britain in the short term. This move requires a great deal of courage on the part of the government, because the danger is too great and most people still do not approve of it. But Roosevelt clearly believes that the people's love of peace should not hinder the plan for overall victory. Confiscating Axis ships will probably be used by Britain. This is just one precursor to the incident. It can now be stated that the United States may be involved in the war around the end of June. Roosevelt has given Britain and the world a pledge to defeat Hitler. The two are each driving a train, racing on the track of war. There will be a day of collision. Everyone believes that if the United States delivers goods to Britain, it cannot but use the Navy and Air Force. Germany's shooting is a matter of course. (AP, 2nd)

### Japanese Social Situation Deteriorating

Tokyo - According to people in police circles, after three and a half years of war with China, Japan's social situation has been affected in terms of morality and physical condition. Young people are the worst. Many young people are becoming increasingly decadent and unaware of the country's urgent needs. They commit crimes frequently and are shameless. Although this situation was previously discovered in all belligerent countries during the European War, it is trending downwards. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Changes in the Composition of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department: All Parties Are Closely Watching, Believing It Is Insufficient to Satisfy Chinese Expectations, and a Temporary Solution Will Be Difficult to Sustain for Long

Shanghai Hua Guo He Ye She Chong, Telegraph on the 2nd: The press here today severely criticized the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC)'s attempt to compromise with Japan and vehemently opposed the proposal to change the number of directors. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the proposal to reorganize the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council because it had not yet reviewed the contents of the new plan. However, the Chinese side generally opposed the plan, believing that this move was an act of compromise, which not only failed to satisfy Japan's desire for greater management power in the International Settlement but would also encourage Japan to make further demands. Before 1937, although China had repeatedly made concessions to Japan, it still failed to stop Japan.

Unanimous Expectation: Handle with Caution

The English-language *China Press* stated: "In an atmosphere of unprecedented terrorism, the Shanghai Municipal Council, unable to withstand the threats and oppression of the Japanese, has succumbed to the Japanese. This decision by the Municipal Council to sacrifice the Chinese to please the Japanese sets a very dangerous precedent. Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General and Chairman of the Municipal Council, said that the Municipal Council wanted to seek a temporary solution, but the proposed solution will never achieve its goal and will only exacerbate the dissatisfaction within the settlement. Because Chinese residents constitute the vast majority, reducing their representation will not win their goodwill. Compromise will only increase Japan's desires and allow the Japanese to further encroach." The *Shishi Xinbao* reported: "This change is clearly a manifestation of the Municipal Council's appeasement policy. This method is essentially an ostrich policy, not only unwise but also very dangerous. Only firm and effective measures can stop Japan's extravagant hopes and deeply affect the interests of the countries concerned. We hope that the Municipal Council authorities will handle this situation with caution."

British, American, and Japanese Consuls-General Continue Negotiations

According to sources yesterday, "After the news that the Municipal Council would increase the number of German directors by one and the number of directors of other nationalities by two, Portugal, which has a large number of expatriates in Shanghai, is expected to obtain one director's seat, and the other seat will be held by expatriates from Switzerland or Scandinavian countries. As for the rumors that the relevant parties have reached a consensus on the director allocation method, it is heard that the Consular Body has not yet formally received the redistribution proposal agreed upon by the British, American, and Japanese Consuls-General as of yesterday, but it is believed that negotiations are still ongoing, and the parties concerned will definitely reach an agreement in the near future."

Various Parties Vie for the Remaining Two Seats

It was also said that "Someone has put forward an informal proposal that the European countries will be given two seats on the Municipal Council Board of Directors, one for countries occupied by Germany and the other for countries not occupied by Germany. If this method is realized, Portuguese expatriates can obtain one director's seat, and the other seat will be held by Dutch expatriates or expatriates from Scandinavian countries. What is worrying is that if a director is appointed from a country occupied by Germany, the German side may be able to exert pressure on him. Therefore, there is a proposal that the Swiss expatriates should hold one of the seats, because the Swiss expatriates also have a considerable number of industries in Shanghai." The reporter also asked whether Russian expatriates in Shanghai, who are second only to Japanese expatriates in number, should be given a seat. The well-informed person replied that when the relevant parties discussed the election issue, they did not pay attention to the Russian expatriates alone because most of the Russian expatriates live in the French Concession. Yesterday, the reporter also inquired about this issue from the Portuguese expatriates, who said that the Portuguese expatriate representatives had informally applied for a director's seat and would do their best to achieve their goal. The number of Portuguese expatriates in Shanghai is no less than 3,000, and they really have the right to enjoy this kind of right.

Development Trends Cannot Be Predicted

Officials of the English-language *North China Daily News* refused to express their opinions on this year's election issue this morning. An official said, "No one can predict what developments will occur in the election issue." And refused to release the list of candidates received by the Municipal Council.

The Main Culprit in the Theft Case Also Attempts to Run for Election

Hulbert, the protagonist of the 3 million copper ingot case, announced yesterday that he intends to participate in this year's Municipal Council director election and has decided that his election slogan will be "Oppose High Taxes." Hulbert said that if Shanghai needs him, he is willing to serve it. Hulbert did not mention whether the Swiss Consul-General in Shanghai, Fontanel, agreed to Hulbert's decision to participate in the election. Hulbert said that he grew up in Shanghai and witnessed Shanghai transform from a small town into a prosperous metropolis, so he believes he can help it overcome its current difficulties.

Decision to Hold a Special Meeting First

The *North China Herald* reported that the Danish Consul-General and Doyen of the Consular Body, Mr. Hille, at the request of the Municipal Council, has issued a notice in accordance with Article 15 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, setting a special meeting of taxpayers at 2:30 pm on April 17th at the Grandstand of the Racecourse to pass new articles of association and amendments to the existing articles of association. The resolution will be proposed by the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Cornfoot, and seconded by Mr. Mitchell, a director. It is understood that the special meeting of taxpayers will be held on the same day as the annual general meeting of taxpayers, but the special meeting of taxpayers will be held first.

### British Ambassador Departs Shanghai for Chongqing

Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, arrived in Shanghai by boat with his wife and others on the 4th of last month, and stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. He went to the embassy every day to handle official business, made plans for the withdrawal of British expatriates from the occupied areas and the dredging of Shanghai's coal sources, and summoned George, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, and others to inquire in detail. After staying in Shanghai for a month, he was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of last month, but due to unfinished official business, he postponed his departure. He has now completed his official business in Shanghai and left Shanghai by boat at 8 pm the day before yesterday to go to Hong Kong, and then flew to Chongqing to maintain close contact with the Chinese government. The ambassador's entourage was very simple, only his private secretary, Mr. MacKenzie, and others accompanied him. The ambassador's wife will stay in Shanghai for the time being, residing in a private residence on Dunxin Road, and will go to Chile to visit relatives in the near future.

### Harvard Alumni Association Held Its Annual Meeting Last Night, Unanimously Wishing Friend Roosevelt Good Health in His Administration

The Harvard University Shanghai Alumni Association held its annual meeting at the American Club on Fuzhou Road last night. The school has been established for more than 300 years and is a famous university of the current era, with a large number of talented people. It was a grand event with many people gathering together. The annual meeting elected President He Dequi as chairman. Attendees included American Consul Mr. Lockhart, Colonel Baker, American Judge Hamilton, Mr. Bu Fangji, Mr. Ferguson, Yan Deqing, Li Zhaoqian, Shen Siliang, Li Pei'en, Ming Side, and Mr. Powell, the editor of the *China Weekly Review*, and more than one hundred members. First, Li Que Sen proposed a toast to President Roosevelt, a fellow alumnus, for his health. Then, the new officers were elected. Li Que Sen, the procurator of the Zhejiang High Court, was elected president, and Shen Youqian, the chief of the education department of the Public Works Department, was elected vice president. Mr. Meijia of the Texaco Oil Company was elected honorary secretary, and Qiao Wenshou was elected accountant. After the election, a film commemorating the 300th anniversary of the establishment of Harvard University in 1936 was shown, which was extremely precious. It ended at about 9 o'clock.

### It Is Rumored That the Italian Ship Conte Verde Will Sail to Japan Covertly: British Naval Authorities Are Closely Monitoring, but the Italian Shipping Company Resolutely Denies It

The British naval authorities in Shanghai are still closely monitoring the actions of the Italian ship *Conte Verde* yesterday. According to a certain international law authority yesterday, if the ship sails out of the territorial waters of a neutral country, British warships can treat it as a prize of war and take it over. If the Italian ship refuses, the British army can sink it. However, officials of the Italian Mail Steamship Company refused to comment on the future actions of the ship when they met with reporters yesterday. However, they believed that the rumor in Shanghai newspapers that the ship would sail to Japan was absurd. Since the outbreak of war between Britain and Italy, the ship has been docked in the Huangpu River. The workers on the ship were still busy washing the cabins and scraping off the mud on both sides yesterday. It is heard that the general manager of the Italian Mail Steamship Company is now stranded in Japan and has not returned to Shanghai for a long time. It is impossible to confirm whether this is related to the ship sailing to Japan.

Adding Fuel, Obviously Making Preparations

The *Continental Times* reported that the Italian mail ship *Conte Verde*, which was stranded in Shanghai, was preparing to leave here late yesterday night, but as of 1:00 am today (the 2nd), the ship was still moored in the Huangpu River near Yangshupu Lan Road. The *Conte Verde* was filling up with water and fuel all day yesterday, obviously making final preparations for departure. It is said that the ship will sail to Kobe at high tide between midnight and 2:00 am tonight, equipped with weapons, to engage in piracy.

German Ships Reportedly Escorted by Japanese Warships

Also, when the German ship *Ramses*, which left Shanghai late Saturday night or Sunday morning, arrived at the mouth of the Wusong River, it was escorted by about two Japanese destroyers to Kobe, where it was equipped and converted into a supply ship to supply the pirate ships. People here point out that the increasing activity of Axis ships in the Far East is reminiscent of the rumors that the Italian gunboat *Eritrea* had already arrived in Kobe on March 23.

All Italian Ship Crew Members Retained

Also, the *Shanghai Times* reported that it was unable to obtain confirmation from port authorities or other sources regarding the secret preparations of the Italian Mail Steamship Company's giant ship *Conte Verde* or its impending departure. According to reports, after Italy joined the war last spring, the ship was stranded in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River in Pudong, and it is believed that all of its crew members have been retained and are serving on the ship.

### Interest Rates Reduced by the Bankers' Association Starting Yesterday: Idle Funds Still Abundant, Difficulty Finding Outlets for Deposits

Regarding the fact that the Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry will appropriately reduce the deposit interest rates of various banks and firms starting on April 1, the reporter of the *Xin Sheng She* specifically inquired about everything from the committee yesterday. A certain gentleman of the committee told us that the deposits of various exchange banks and other banks and firms in the committee are part of the daily operating funds of each of those banks and firms. Its purpose is to facilitate the daily collection and settlement of bills. Because our country's commercial interest rate was originally higher than that of foreign countries, the financial industry has always given interest on interbank deposits to provide some financial support. The level of interbank deposit interest rates of the committee must be determined by the tightness of the money market and the agent collection and settlement bank at any time. The committee handled bill exchange matters in March of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1933], at which time both taels and dollars were still in use. The initial interest rate for clearing house deposits was 2% per year for taels and 1% per year for dollars. Later, the clearing house dollar deposit interest rate was changed to 1.5% per year. Since the Incident [i.e., the start of the Sino-Japanese War], the Shanghai money market has been tighter. In the spring of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938], the foreign exchange control was implemented, and there was a phenomenon of capital flight in Shanghai. The money market tightened, and the committee increased the clearing house deposits of various banks and firms from the original 1.5% per year to 2% per month in November of that year, and then increased it to 3% per year in December. In the autumn of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939], the European War broke out, and idle funds gathered in

Shanghai from all over the world, and this became even worse in the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940]. Therefore, the committee slightly reduced the deposit interest rates of various banks and firms in November of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940]. The interest rate for exchange banks was 2% per year, and the interest rate for other banks and firms was 1.75% per year. However, the situation of abundant idle funds is still becoming more serious. The committee believes that on the one hand, the interest burden has increased compared to before, and on the other hand, the channels for investment are still felt to be narrow. Therefore, the committee will separately determine the interest-bearing limit for the clearing house deposits of each bank and firm. Within the limit, the deposit interest rate for exchange banks has been changed to 1.5% per year, and the deposit interest rate for other industry peers has been changed to 1.25% per year. No interest will be paid on deposits exceeding the limit. Although the interest rate has been slightly reduced again, it is actually the same as the pre-war interest rate. Mr. Wang Shenfu, a prominent businessman in the city, recently visited the Xin Pu Yu Tang [New Universal Fosterage Hall] with his wife and children and asked to distribute the 2,000 loaves of bread he brought. Hundreds of orphans, the elderly, and the weak were all smiles and thanked him repeatedly. Mr. Wang had donated a large sum of money and had made special achievements in soliciting donations from relatives and friends, benefiting the poor and sick, which is commendable. The donations received by the hall are recorded as follows: Xie Sheng Oil Firm, Wu Zhilin, Rui He Hao, Ju Shun Oil Firm, Feng Ji, Lan Ji, Jin Ji, Bei Tong Yu, Qia Da, Yuan Da, Jun Tai, Wan Sen Yu, each donated one can of oil, Yuan Yu donated one basket of dried salted radish, the Shanghai Charity Group donated 300 yuan, Chen Jueping donated 200 yuan, Liu Jingchen and Liu Fangchen of the Wanguo Pharmacy each donated 100 yuan, Zhu Jixiang donated 100 yuan for his deceased mother's memorial day, an anonymous person donated 10 yuan, Mr. Wang Shenfu solicited donations of 500 yuan from Chen Hansha and Pu Zhiliang, Chen Hansha solicited donations of 500 yuan from Yuan Maosheng Cotton Cloth Shop, Zhou Sensheng and Zhang Chi each donated 100 yuan, Da De Xin Oil Press and Xinhua Peppermint Company each donated 300 yuan, He Ji and Qiu Jingliang each donated 50 yuan, an anonymous person donated 5 yuan, Jin Shenren donated 3 yuan, and the Cosmic Pharmaceutical Factory donated medicines worth 500 yuan. Tong Yu Salt Industry Company donated 5 dan of salt, and An Tai Hao donated two bags of soybeans and ten bags of rice.

### Tao Guangchuan Can Be Released on Bail Soon: The Police Station Is Now at Ease

Tao Guangchuan, the principal of Lequn Middle School at No. 970 Avenue du Roi Albert, was suddenly searched by certain personnel, accompanied by Western police, in the principal's office on the 28th of last month. In the end, nothing was found. Before leaving, Tao was arrested. It has been a week since he was detained at the Central Police Station. His family has visited the police station twice. Tao is very at ease inside. It is now known that Tao is still being detained at the police station. The police station also believes that Tao usually concentrates on education and has no other activities, so he will probably be released on bail.

### Announcement of Members of the Shipping Committee: Shipping Rangoon Rice to Shanghai, Monthly Quota of More Than 15,000 Tons, Rice to Be Sold Only to Licensed Rice Shops

According to the information office of the Public Works Department, the bureau has now organized a committee to represent the bureau in finding ways to charter ships to transport 15,000 to 20,000 tons of rice from Rangoon to Shanghai every month until the local rice market improves. The members of the committee are Sun Ruihuang, Lan Rong, Mr. Halle, Mr. Melo, and Mr. Nasi.

Shipping Negotiations Probably Already Underway

According to people close to the Public Works Department, the authorities have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary rice transport ships and are expected to have started charter negotiations with several shipping companies in the city. After the bureau announced the rice transport plan last Friday, it received enthusiastic responses from all parties and must have decided to fully implement its plan. Also, well-informed sources said yesterday that the hope of obtaining more national rice has vanished, because although "the city" [i.e. the Shanghai Municipal Government] has repeatedly promised, its position cannot provide assistance to the two concessions.

Restricting Sales: Three Methods

Also, according to another credible source, the method of controlling the rice market was proposed by the authorities of the French Concession. The detailed regulations will probably be announced by the authorities of the two concessions at the same time today. It is heard that after the implementation of this method, any rice merchant who orders foreign rice from abroad must first register with the concession authorities, otherwise they will not be allowed to sell it in Shanghai. Those who register in advance will be charged by the concession authorities with the production price, plus freight, insurance, and legal profits, and will be responsible for selling it in various rice shops, so as to eliminate hoarding and speculation. According to Mr. Mingside, the following items must be complied with when transferring the Public Works Department's ships to transport rice: (1) The rice imported by them must be sold to 665 licensed rice shops in the British and French concessions. (2) Only Grade 3 rice can be transported, and high-quality rice cannot be transported. (3) This type of imported rice must be sold in retail and can be freely resold without obtaining a certificate, but each time it must not exceed 5 pounds or 10 pounds. Mr. Ming concluded that those who violate the above regulations will be prohibited from making further decisions on goods.

### Trade Associations Throughout the City Send Telegrams to Mao Zedong, etc.: Deeply Hope to Stop Before It Is Too Late, Abide by Promises, and Work Together to Complete the Great Cause of Resistance and Reconstruction

Since the Incident [i.e., the start of the Sino-Japanese War], China has relied on the unity and hard work of the people throughout the country to lay the foundation for the final victory. Unexpectedly, at this time when the dawn is in sight and the great cause is about to be accomplished, the Communist Party, regardless of the nation's survival, goes back on its word and sabotages the resistance and reconstruction, causing public outrage among the people throughout the country. Various public groups and associations in the city have successively sent telegrams urging it not to become a sinner of the ages. It is now known that the trade associations of various industries throughout the city, affiliated with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, also sent telegrams to Mao Zedong, etc., yesterday. The original text is extracted as follows:

Support the Government and Work Together to Resist the Enemy

Yan'an Telegram to Councilor Mao Zedong and transfer to Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, Lin Zuhan, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Gentlemen: Since the publication of your party's declaration in the 26th year of the Republic [i.e. 1937], supporting the government and working together to resist the enemy, the people throughout the country have deeply sympathized and taken notice. This is because you have given up the private disputes of one party and one class, and are willing to work hard for national liberation. In short, you have gained the hearts of the people by fulfilling your oaths and seeking truth from facts.

Going Back on Promises and Sabotaging Resistance and Reconstruction

After four years of hard fighting and the dawn is in sight, it is time to unite as one, make persistent efforts, and strive for the final victory. Gentlemen, you suddenly submitted so-called follow-up measures and temporary solutions that are enough to shake the foundation of the country, as tools to pressure attendance in the current session of the People's Political Council because of the government's disbanding of the New Fourth Army. From the standpoint of your party, this is a betrayal of promises. From the standpoint of the overall situation, this is a sabotage of resistance and reconstruction. What day is today? How can we allow the re-emergence of infighting? Gentlemen, is this not making the enemy rejoice and the loved ones grieve?

Attacking Friendly Troops and Expanding Troops Indiscriminately

In the past few years, the New Fourth Army in Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces has often been heard attacking friendly troops and not fighting the enemy, expanding troops indiscriminately, doing nothing but demanding food from the people and encroaching on defense zones, purely to expand territory, and still saying that this is a democratic politics, exerting all the power of propaganda, as if the eyes and ears of the people of the country are blind and deaf, and it is not difficult to deceive them all. However, it is not known that the actions of betraying the country and disrupting discipline have been pointed out by the people on both sides of the Yangtze River, and are well known and detailed.

Dividing Unity, Taking Advantage of Danger to Rebel

The government has imposed sanctions to rectify military discipline and strengthen the combat formation. The army deserves it, and the people of the country still regret that it was too slow. Gentlemen, how can you, with your party's selfishness, ignore the black and white and wrongly favor it? It must be known that Heaven sees as the people see, and Heaven hears as the people hear. Right and wrong are as clear as a mirror. At this critical moment, when survival is at stake, any party is supported by the people of the country. On the contrary, those who are afraid of fighting the enemy, brave in private fighting, dividing unity, taking advantage of danger to rebel, using the name of fighting to carry out the reality of rebellion, and aiming at seizing political power, no matter how strong their army is, are the sinners of the nation and the moths of the country. Even if they have a flowery pen and a glib tongue, the result of their propaganda is enough to expose their crimes. Even a three-foot child will not be deceived, let alone bewitch the masses and hope to use them.

The Merchants and People of Shanghai Have Strong Beliefs. Alas, Our Merchants and People of Shanghai, Under Daily Oppression, Endure Humiliation and Prolong Life, Losing Assets and Destroying Families, Without Shaking Slightly, Are Confident of the Inevitable Victory of Resistance and Reconstruction, and Believe That the Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists Will Result in Fruitful Warfare, Which Will Be Able to Complete the Integrity of Territory and Sovereignty and the Restoration of the Nation, Thus Lifting Our People Out of Fire and Water and Ascending to Peace. Once We Suddenly Hear That Your Party Has Gone Back on Its Promises and Obstructed the Counter-Offensive of the Great Army, It Is Like a Bolt from the Blue and a Bucket of Cold Water on Our Heads. We Are Truly Filled with the Fear of an Overturned Nest and Grief in Our Hearts, Wanting to Cry but Having No Tears.

Abide by Promises and Work Together in Harmony

We Believe That Gentlemen Are All Talents of the Era and Pillars of the Country, And Have Always Taken It Upon Themselves to Be Foresighted And Have Been Widely Praised and Respected by Society for a Long Time. We Still Hope That You Will Not Indulge in Impulses and Will Value the Nation Above All Else, Quickly Rein in the Horse on the Cliff, Continue the Policy of Clarity and Generosity, Abide by the Previous Promises, and Work Together in Harmony With the Government to Complete the Great Cause of Resistance and Reconstruction. Not Only Will the People's Confidence Be Restored Immediately, but Glorious Achievements Will Be Seen Eternally Recorded in History, Receiving the Admiration of All Ages. Our Trade Associations Throughout Shanghai, In Addition to Asking the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to Express Our Concerns in a Clever Telegram Last Month, Because We Deeply Hope for the Unity of the Kuomintang and the Communists, We Are Not Afraid of Wordiness and Repeatedly Express Our Views in the Hope That You Will Pay Attention. We Ardently Hope and Pray. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and All Trade Associations Throughout the City Bow.

### Japanese Naval Commanders Leave Shanghai Hastily

According to confirmed news in the shipping industry, the Japanese Navy is now attempting to build naval bases in the Zhoushan Islands and the Da Ming Chong [Greater Ming Barrier Reef], and the Japanese merchant ships operating between Shanghai, Zhoushan Dinghai, and Chongming have recently become even more strict in restricting passengers traveling to and from these locations. Since the Nakao Unit of the Japanese Army in Zhoushan Island began constructing roads, they have been quite panicked because they have been repeatedly attacked by Chinese mobile units. The commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, Shigitaro Shimada, and the commander of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, Kobayashi, hastily took a ship from Shanghai to Dinghai the other day to hold a military conference, attempting to defend it to the death. For days, a total of six Japanese warships have been concentrated at the head of Zhoushan Island and the sea off Daishan Island, including a small aircraft carrier. The Chinese coastal defense forces have been strictly monitoring and on guard.

### Floating Mines Discovered in Hong Kong Waters: Customs Issues Maritime Alert

The Hong Kong Port Master notified the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau (i.e., the Customs Port Affairs Section) that, according to a report from the Bao'an ship, floating mines were discovered in the waters of Cheung Chau near Hong Kong. After receiving the report, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau has issued a maritime alert, ordering all foreign ships traveling on the Nanyang route to pay close attention.

### Electricity Conservation Has No Significant Impact Yet

The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Department reported that the need to conserve electricity last month has had no significant impact on industrial output. This is probably because most factories have only received electricity conservation notices for a week or two. Moreover, the amount to be reduced is 30% of the highest usage within the past thirteen months, so the reduction in recent usage seems to be lower. Therefore, the impact on the industrial sector does not appear to be significant.

### Rumors That Guo Shun Has Left Shanghai Are Inaccurate: Has Not Been in Contact with the Outside World for the Past Few Days, Leading to Widespread Rumors That Mr. Guo Has Gone Elsewhere

The *Shanghai Evening Post* reported that reliable Chinese sources yesterday (the 1st) said that Guo Shun, a Chinese director of the Public Works Department, has also recently left Shanghai for Hong Kong. After repeated inquiries at Guo's residence on Jing'an Temple Road, the answer received was "Mr. Guo is not at home." It is verified that Guo and the other four Chinese directors have been re-elected by the taxpaying Chinese association, but Yu Qiaqing and Chen Tingrui, two of the Chinese directors, have recently left Shanghai one after another. With Guo Shun leaving, only two Chinese directors remain in Shanghai. The English-language *North China Daily News* said that according to people close to Guo Shun, a Chinese director of the Public Works Department, Guo Shun has not yet left Shanghai, but is expected to leave soon. The outside world has been unable to contact Guo Shun for the past few days, leading to rumors that Mr. Guo has already left Shanghai, but this rumor has recently been refuted.

### Four Retired Military Officers Simultaneously Arrested by the Japanese: Wang Shouting, a Mr. Zhou, and Two Aides

Wang Shouting, a Zhenjiang native residing at a certain address on Avenue Albert, is sixty-one years old. He formerly served as the Commander of the Yangtze River Fortress of the Navy. Due to his advanced age and frequent illnesses, he had long retired and was recuperating in Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 29th of last month, at 7:00 PM, personnel from the Japanese Military Police dispatched officers to the French Concession Police to request assistance. They rushed to Wang's residence, arrested Wang, and also apprehended two aides who lived in the same residence. They were taken to the French Concession Police Station for interrogation and then extradited to the Hongkou headquarters for further investigation. It is understood that Wang participated in battles during the August 13th Incident but requested retirement from his superiors due to his age and illness. He has been recuperating in Shanghai for more than two years. The reason for his sudden arrest this time is unknown. At the same time, a certain Mr. Zhou from Fujian, in his thirties, residing at 220 Avenue du Roi Albert, who served as the Commander of the Fujian Fortress before the August 13th Incident, was also arrested by Japanese personnel.

### Cotton Cloth Store Robbed, Charity House Shot

Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, several armed robbers plotted to rob the Xifeng Cotton Cloth Store at No. 64 Beijing Road in a large building. Wang Suisheng (21 years old, from Jiangxi), an employee of the store’s relief department, saw the unfavorable situation and stepped forward to stop them, angering the robbers. They immediately fired a shot, hitting Wang in the abdomen. The robbers, realizing they had caused trouble, dispersed in a panic. Patrol officers from No. 558 summoned an ambulance from Renji Hospital, which rushed him to the hospital for surgery. His condition is critical.

### Punishment for Concealing Military Weapons

On the afternoon of the 26th of last month, at 6:00 PM, the search team of the Gordon Road Police Station apprehended a local named Zhu Xingfu on the No. 20 trolleybus on Xin Zha Road for carrying military weapons. A pistol and four bullets were confiscated and handed over to the Special No. 1 Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated that the principal offender was still at large and requested an investigation. Questioned, the defendant insisted that the gun and bullets were given to him by a friend surnamed Zhang in the French Concession to take to a certain place, and pleaded for leniency. Judge Huang sentenced Zhu Xingfu to one year of imprisonment as a warning, and the gun and bullets were confiscated.

### Robbers Sentenced

Jiangbei native robber Wang Guilong, along with nine accomplices who have already been sentenced, robbed the Minben Soap Factory at No. 70 Da Xi Road on August 19, 1938. Also, on the morning of August 22 of the same year, at 9:00 AM, they robbed the China General Omnibus Company of 17,450 yuan in cash near Yanan Road on Kang Nao Road and fled. On the evening of March 14 of this year, at 9:00 PM, the Hongkou Police, based on a report, arrested Wang on North Henan Road near Rue Amiral Courbet, and also detained Wang Bu, Ms. Wu, and Ms. Lu for transporting weapons. They were handed over to the Special No. 1 Court for interrogation and conclusion. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Wang Guilong to eleven years and six months for repeated armed robbery, Wang Bu, Ms. Wu, and Ms. Lu were each sentenced to one year and six months for assisting in transporting firearms. The Putuo Police apprehended robbers Li Funian and others, who robbed the residence of Yue Ren at No. 40, Lane 1209, Xiaosha Ferry Road, of 1,140 yuan in foreign currency. After being handed over to the Special No. 1 Court for interrogation and conclusion, Judge Huang sentenced Li Funian to seven years of imprisonment for robbery, Chen Daohai to five years and six months, and confiscated one box cannon and seven bullets.

### Social Miscellany

Chen Bao, a Shandong native employed as a patrolman at No. 436 Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession, 25 years old, accidentally discharged his firearm while cleaning it yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM. The bullet struck his right leg. He was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Travelers to Hong Kong: Temporary Entry Permits Issued Starting from April 1st

Since Hong Kong implemented immigration regulations on January 14 of this year, Chinese citizens traveling to Hong Kong must first obtain an entry permit issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department to enter. Otherwise, they must prepay a cash guarantee to purchase tickets and board the ship. The process of obtaining these entry permits takes time, and the procedures for refunding the guarantee are quite cumbersome, causing hardship for travelers. Recognizing this, the China Travel Service in Shanghai requested special privileges from the Hong Kong Immigration Department to issue temporary entry permits in Shanghai. After several discussions, approval was finally obtained, and issuance began on April 1st. In the future, travelers to Hong Kong who can first complete the permit application at the agency can request the issuance of a temporary entry permit without a cash guarantee and land in Hong Kong with the permit. Its legal effect is no different from that of a formal entry permit. In addition to collecting the prescribed fees for formal entry permits (two types: HK$4 or HK$8), the agency will not charge any additional fees for temporary entry permits.

### Robbery Notes

Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, four robbers broke into No. 15, Lane 364, North Jiangxi Road, brandishing guns to prevent any outcry. They robbed 5,000 yuan in legal currency and clothing, then fled out the door and disappeared without a trace.

Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, two robbers suddenly entered the home of a Westerner named Barden (transliteration) at No. 11, Lane 408, Da Xi Road. One robber drew a pistol and ordered silence. They robbed a gold watch, a camera, a lensometer, and cash totaling over 1,000 yuan before escaping.

The night before last, at around 11:00 PM, six robbers broke into the home of Ningbo native Wu Rongyao at No. 176 Rue Lafayette, one wielding a fake pistol and another holding a sharp blade. They robbed Wu's family of several hundred yuan in property.

They then went to the home of Qian Wenzhi at No. 178 on the same road. One robber used a knife to threaten Qian's wife, Ms. Qian Wang (22 years old). Unexpectedly, the woman fainted in fright and jumped from the window, causing serious injuries. She was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, where it was reported that her spine was broken, and her condition remains dangerous.

### Food: The Price of Foreign Rice Rises Immediately After Seizure

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice rose in the morning and fell in the evening, and the market turned to a spiral trend, but the result was still one or two yuan higher than the previous market. When the market opened early in the morning, after the limit price was virtually cancelled, local merchants eagerly bought up the stock. The hoarding side also publicly released samples, but because demand turned strong, and it was rumored that Ningbo merchants were buying three or five hundred tons of Xiaojiao Yinghua Si in the market to transport to the rice-deficient areas along the Yangtze River, people's hearts were once again stimulated, and those who held goods and general speculators took the opportunity to call up prices, and the market suddenly became prosperous. Currently, the market price of Xiaojiao, which is traded in foreign rice, was sold at 106 yuan as soon as it opened in the morning, and then continued to rise to 107.5 yuan, and the middle price was 106.5 yuan. Other products such as No. 1 Saigon also had a wide range of prices, opening at 112 yuan and 111 yuan, but No. 2 still only opened at 106 or 107 yuan, Tokyo Pojian was priced from 101 yuan, followed by 97.5 yuan, Nianjian was priced at 105 yuan, Milu was priced at 94 yuan, and Suijian was priced at 87 to 88 yuan, followed by 74 to 75 yuan. In short, Xiaojiao was more than three yuan higher than the previous market, and other goods such as No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon only increased by one or two yuan. The original package of Yinghua Si Xiaojiao rice also rose from 125 or 126 yuan to 129 yuan, an increase of three or four yuan compared with the previous day. However, in the afternoon, local merchants stopped buying because they felt the price was too expensive, and the re-export trade was also sufficient, so the sales were stagnant, and many speculators and profiteers sought to sell, so the market returned a little by one or two yuan in the evening, and the market became weak and spiritless. Due to the re-export trade, the total transaction volume for the whole day, including the original package, was 27,000 to 28,000 bags. Yesterday, 3,000 bags of corn were transported to Yantai.

For thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice, the general cargo owners saw that the foreign rice was tightening and became more determined to sell, so the market for thin japonica rice was smooth, and the market saw a rebound of one and a half yuan. Qingjiaojiao saw thin rice opening at 110 yuan, followed by 108.5 yuan, but thick japonica rice was unable to compete with thin rice, only showing a stable situation, because the market was full of goods and the sales were not good. Changbang Zhentiejiao still opened at 120 yuan, Gaojing at 118 yuan, Kunshan Gaobaijing at 116 yuan, followed by 109 yuan, and the original package was not opened.

In the environment of glutinous rice, the minds of both buyers and sellers are also prosperous, so not only is the retail appetite quite refreshing, but there are also bulk transactions by large households, and the sellers then became more charming and shouted high, and as a result, the selling price also increased by yuan. Hong Kong Te Wu opened at 106 yuan, the general market was 104 yuan to 102 yuan, followed by 100 yuan, and Nuo Lu Te was priced from 98 yuan, followed by 93 yuan.

More foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. Yihua Foreign Company's Yusheng Wheel arrived in port at 9:00 PM the night before last (the 1st), carrying 10,264 bags from Hong Kong, and was docked at the Roosevelt Pier to unload.

### Flour Market Does Not Escape Spiral

The flour market is still stable, and its process must be first weak and then tight, not escaping the state of spiral. Checking the morning opening, because there is a lot of foreign flour in stock, scattered households are seeking to sell with the market, and Jinlong brand Kan flour once loosened to 28.65 yuan, but because the price of rice rose, customers hoarded to absorb at low prices, and the market tightened again, Jinlong flour rebounded to 28.9 yuan, Zhonglou Flower and Bird brand was 29.3 or 4 yuan, and the number of transactions was about nearly 10,000 bags. The price of flat-selling flour has not changed, and 5,872 bags are still supplied by Fuxin Factory, and the rest are supplemented by foreign flour.

The wheat market is quiet in terms of arrival and sales, and the market is stagnant for a long time. The market in Japanese factories must also have no goods to collect, and the market is becoming more and more calm. It is said that the Chinese factories have contacted foreign merchants to order Australian wheat, but in the end, because of the lack of ships, it has not been concluded.

Foreign flour continues to arrive at the port. In addition to carrying a large number of foreign rice from Hong Kong, Yihua Foreign Company's Yusheng Wheel also brought in half a thousand and ninety-one bags of flour, which arrived in Shanghai the night before last (the 1st) and was docked at the Roosevelt Pier to unload. Today, there are 500 bags of flour to be transported to Xiamen, which is the local flour. (Zu)

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Falls, Soybean Cake Rises

Yesterday, the soybean oil market saw a decline of two or three yuan due to sluggish actual sales and a weary underlying trend. Although the futures oil market was trying to save the situation by hoarders, the general trend was unfavorable to the bulls, and the struggle was in vain. A total of 50 barrels of Dalian oil were traded at a price of 141 yuan, and 1,200 barrels were ordered for delivery in April at a price of 141.25 yuan to 139.5 yuan, and recovered to 140 yuan. 600 barrels were ordered for delivery in late April at a price of 143.5 yuan to 140.05 yuan. Since the short squeeze, the soybean cake market has been tight and rising for a while. Moreover, the inland sales market has recently been inquiring, so in the state of insufficient spot goods, it is even more charming. The market rose once because the bulls had slightly come out the previous day, but the inland route continued to pick up yesterday, and the market turned up again. 3,000 pieces of Jisheng cake were traded at a price of 17.2 yuan to 17.32 yuan, 1,000 pieces of Feizi cake were traded at a price of 17.05 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of Changji cake were ordered for delivery in April at a price of 17.5 yuan.

It was only heard that speculators slightly inserted the April US exchange rate at 5.3125 yuan, and still wanted to short the May US exchange rate at 5.28125 yuan, but outsiders had no intention of this price, so no transaction was made. In this way, until the close, there was no vitality, and as a result, the spot goods and the current month's British gold were still reported as 3-bant 2.234375, and the US exchange rate was 5.28125, and the May British gold was 3-bant 1.2875, and the US exchange rate was 5.25, with no glory or disgrace compared to the previous day's spot period.

### Gold Market is Calm

The black market state of Raw Gold yesterday was even more quiet, and it was also a rare market since futures trading was done. One reason was that foreign exchange lacked rise and fall, and the market was calm, and the other reason was that the commission was increased, and speculators had no intention of starting, and most of them were closing transactions, resulting in a sharp reduction in transactions, accounting for about 10,000 taels, and the price fluctuated between 6,500 yuan and a slight increase of 150 to 60 yuan throughout the day, and the result was 6 yuan, which was 6,563 yuan. The spot market was firm, and initially Xianghe absorbed 200 taels from Chengji, adding 140 yuan, and then He Sheng absorbed 60 taels, adding 150 yuan. Later, Defu and Baocheng each absorbed 50 taels from Yongcheng, and Yili absorbed 10 taels from He Sheng, all adding 150 yuan. It is estimated that the price increased by 20 yuan from the previous day.

Raw Gold Slightly Better at 6 Yuan

The market opened at 6,560 yuan per bar (10 taels) in the early morning, which was 4 yuan higher than the previous day. Then, because Decheng, Defu, Dayuan, and Yili threw out, it once fell to 6,545 yuan, but after that, Xianghe absorbed fiercely, followed by Xinfengyong, Xin Yu, Yili, Dafeng, and Gonghe, and Deda shorted, and then fell to 6,557 yuan. Later, Lai Jinyuan and Wanfeng absorbed, and Xianghe and Xiangxingyong re-entered, and Deda traced to buy to cover the short, so it rose to 6,565 yuan before the close, and the result was 6,563 yuan to close, which was 6 yuan higher than the previous day. The closing price was 6,594.1 yuan based on the US dollar price of 5.28125 in April, with a difference of 31.1 yuan. There was only 22 yuan in the half day. The selling price of the company's own brand gold was 180 yuan higher than Raw Gold, and the purchase price was 50 yuan lower than the selling price. The current bid gold, etc. had no market and no price.

The Exchange Rate for Ornament Gold Did Not Move

The exchange rate for silver and gold jewelry per tael has not moved all day. It is estimated that Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang are still 690 yuan, and the purchase price is 40 yuan lower.

The supply and demand for Hong Kong tickets were uniform, and the market price was flat. Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets were both weak, the former falling to 1.97 yuan, and the latter falling to 1.64 yuan.

### Securities: Government Bonds are Very Strong

Yesterday, the black market for government bonds continued to weaken, and transactions were chaotic. However, Xinfu turned to have an appetite, and the nine-tenths appetite was also strong. The same Kang was frequently entering and exiting, while Yuxing was selling more. The situation was outwardly weak, but inwardly still strong, because there were many long-term investors, and the short-term positions were gradually decreasing. After several days of weakness, the short-sellers had added a lot of positions, and the environment was slightly better, and the reaction must be huge. Yesterday's transactions saw Xinfu Jiu Cheng Shunchang Xinyuan buying in the morning, Lianhe then took C and entered B, and most of the sellers were scattered households. Yuxing sold a lot of Type A. In the afternoon, Renchang Jiucheng bought, Tongkang entered E and exited C, Jiufeng slightly sold, Yuxing continued to sell Type A, so the result was only a small triangle for Type A alone, and the rest were only 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2. Currently, the market price is the cheapest for Type A and B. Yesterday's total transaction volume was about 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. The following is a simple table:

Type         Highest    Lowest     Closing     Compared to the Previous Day

Unified A     75.55      75.30      75.30      Down 0.30

There was a price but no market, and the rest were unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Difficult for Both Buyers and Sellers, Stagnant Yarn Market

The yarn market is dim and lacks excitement, and the trend is very weak, and the range of rise and fall is only within two yuan, which shows the disunity of people's hearts in general. This kind of scene is unprecedented this year. In fact, the environment is like this, because the long positions are burdened with a large accumulation of inventory, the two factories are too far away from the spot price, and the short positions are too expensive, and the factory's opening and incentive prices are also not very stable, so it presents a difficult situation for both buyers and sellers. Therefore, the speculators are all shouting that there is no target for the time being. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1394 yuan, and the low price was 1391.5 yuan. In the afternoon, because those who attended the Wednesday meeting were scattered, the market price was not opened. Today, 705 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.

The opening of Double Horse in the morning was extremely mediocre and had no momentum. The opening price was 1393 yuan, and it slightly weakened to 2.5 yuan, but the buying and selling in the market was very clear, and the market price did not change much. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange was quiet and the gold standard was stable, and the market was even less volatile. It had been fluctuating between 1393 and 4 yuan for two hours. The middle of the way was once stagnant, and the brokers were all doing nothing. Then the closing price was 1394 yuan. Checking the statistics of transactions in the half day, 3,765 bales were transacted. The amount of each gang buying is as follows: Hong Kong 465, Tonghang 3, 300 statistics 3, 765.

### Fine Velvet Factory has More Active Appetite, Speculators Sell Yarn and Buy Cotton

The current cotton situation is not as lively as the previous day, because the yarn market is not improving, and the foreign exchange is quiet, so it is back to normal. The factory has a normal mindset for 20-count raw materials, but is sometimes in demand for 32-count and 42-count raw materials. However, the general speculators are active again, because the cotton inventory is thinner than the yarn inventory, so there are many people who sell cotton yarn and drop into cotton, which is why the industry has been actively buying and selling recently. However, the fundamental problem is that the yarn market cannot rise, and the factory is unwilling to buy expensive cotton and lose money, and the source is still smooth, which is nothing more than the method of speculators moving east to make up for the west. A total of 1,082 pieces and 636 bales were transacted yesterday, and the price fell slightly by 1 or 2 yuan. The following is a record of the current cotton market:

New York American Cotton Telegraph, the market is mixed, first rising due to peer buying, then falling due to the selling of the Southern gang, and the closing of long positions and political news benefiting the short side. The closing result was a further drop of 8 to 10 pound tones compared to the previous day.

Mumbai Indian Cotton Telegraph, first rising due to speculator buying, then slightly returning due to the closing of long positions. The closing result was a rise of 1 or 2 rupees compared to the previous day, and the opening forecast for tomorrow is a rise of 3 or 4 rupees.

### Textiles: Demand for Mill Cloth Progresses

Cloth Market Slightly Weak

The mill cloth market remains stable; demand from local, Guangdong, and Hong Kong businesses has been progressing. Due to speculative buying in the futures market, Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth's spot prices have increased by 25 to 50 cents per bolt. Sixteen-pound Flower and Butterfly brand coarse cloth from Tongyi Mill has also risen by 50 to 70 cents. Fine cloth remains unchanged, while twill has increased by 10 to 25 cents. Guangdong and Hong Kong businesses traded several hundred bolts of Mermaid-brand colored twill. Zhejiang and Fujian businesses traded seventy to eighty bolts of coarse, fine, and colored cloth. Local dyeing factories and wholesalers traded over eight hundred bolts of gray, coarse, fine, and colored cloth. Fifty bolts of textile products were exported to Yantai in two days, thirty-one bolts to Xiamen in three days, and one thousand one hundred and sixty bolts to Hong Kong.

Eastern cloth's market is slightly weak due to the stagnant yarn market. White fine cloth has fallen back by 10 to 20 cents per bolt. The latest stock list for ten-pound Dragon Head fine cloth closed in the afternoon at $49.80 for spot goods. However, colored broadcloth and fine cotton yarn remain expensive, and the market is tight. Stock prices for Four Gentlemen broadcloth fluctuate between $1.43 and $1.45.

Woolen fabrics are firmly priced, whether openly or covertly. Businesses from Beiping and Tianjin have been purchasing large quantities recently, especially spring and summer woolens. There is also significant demand for autumn and winter fabrics. Suit materials are more actively purchased than Chinese clothing materials.

### Coal: Coal Dust Prices Rise Daily

Since the arrival of 6,000 tons of new Keelung coal dust a month ago, supplies have been scarce. However, demand from various businesses is strong, so market prices have been rising daily. Kaiping No. 2 coal dust is priced at $280, Indian coal dust at $320, Boshan coal dust at $275, and Keelung coal dust at $250. These prices are after industry discounts and delivered to the customer's location, with a small commission added.

Regarding anthracite coal, last month, due to various businesses withholding their stocks, there was a market without trade, allowing covert dealings to manipulate the market. Unexpectedly, yesterday, one business revealed the deal with other companies and the price increased again. Indian anthracite coal is now quoted at $400 per ton, Hongji coal at $370, and No. 1 Small Coal at $370, an increase of $20 to $30 compared to previous market prices. It is reported that large quantities have not yet been released.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Initially Firm, Then Loosen

Yesterday, the sugar market was tight initially but softened later, with little change in the final outcome. According to the association's pricing, spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar initially rose by 15 to 16 cents, reaching $89.76 to $89.60, but then declined slightly by 10 cents to $89.40. Futures followed a similar trend. Contracts for April 10th were initially bid up from $89.90 to $90.01, then fell back to $89.87 to $89.70, a slight decrease of 10 cents. Contracts for April 20th were at $90.50, $91.00, and $90.07, $90.05, $90.06. Dutch red sugar remained at $68.80. Thai Zhan car white B-mark western stock was at $90.05 and a little over thirty cents. DY-mark eastern stock was at $84.50, HX-mark eastern stock at $84.00, and H-mark eastern red sugar at $65.00.

### Seafood: Fennel Prices High Due to Production Costs

Due to repeated increases in production costs, the cost of fennel is rising daily. Yesterday, according to Hong Kong telegraph reports, quoted prices have risen again. The current cost in the Shanghai market is estimated to be $320. Although the Shanghai market is following this upward trend, it is still difficult to reach this price level immediately. Yesterday, the market price was quoted at $300, an increase of over ten dollars from before. The market is expected to tighten further.

### Medicinal Materials: Gardenia Will Arrive Soon

Due to the lack of incoming goods, the market price of gardenia has risen by over twenty dollars. The tight situation has not eased. Yesterday, according to sources in the production area, transportation by steamer is not possible, so it is being shipped by sailboat and is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. However, production costs have increased, and freight charges have also risen, so the market is expected to remain tight.

### Hardware: Iron Nails and Galvanized Iron Decline After Reaching Peak

Iron Nails: The prices of local factory-made nails have been soaring recently, with standard nails exceeding the $200 mark. However, actual sales are not significant. This is due to hoarding by speculators. Because of limited distribution channels, there is now an oversupply of spot goods, leading to a decline in market prices. Yesterday, the price of each keg of Bessemer steel nails was $195.

Galvanized Iron: The situation in the plain galvanized iron market is similar to that of local factory-made nails. Both are used by the construction industry, but the industry has little appetite recently, so the circulation of goods is excessive, leading to softer sales prices. Currently, six-foot sheets are priced at around $15, and seven-foot sheets are priced at around $16.

### Dried Goods: Hainan Longan Continues to Rise

Recently, Hainan longan has seen active demand from Hankou businesses. Stocks are low, and suppliers are tightening supply. Prices have risen rapidly. Yesterday, it was reported that suppliers had released several dozen more packages, leading to an increase of over ten dollars. Businesses from Tianjin are also purchasing ordinary goods, with similar increases in price.

### Miscellaneous: Import of Foreign Soda Ash

The soaring price of Lilian crystal soap is reportedly due to a shortage of raw materials, especially those derived from fats and oils, leading to speculative hoarding. However, 2,460 bags of foreign soda ash arrived yesterday from Hong Kong, a significant quantity.

### Candles and Soap Prices Continue to Rise

The market price of soap is strong, with brisk demand from various quarters. Factories are only releasing small quantities to the industry, which is not enough to meet demand, leading to continuous price increases. Yesterday, the market price for a box of Gu Ben soap was $48.50, White Xiangmao soap was $47, and Yellow Xiangmao soap was $38.50, an increase of over five dollars compared to last week.

The market price of foreign candles is steadily rising. Speculators are continuously purchasing them, and companies are supplying less, leading to a tight market. Ship-brand candles are now selling for $30.04 per box (25 packages), with strong demand from various quarters and further price increases expected.

### Special Feature: Tianqi's Finger Paintings by Ge Zhaotong

Finger painting in Chinese painting can be traced back to Zhang Zao of the Tang Dynasty, who first created it. He used his hands to touch the silk, creating excellent paintings that amazed the famous artist Bi Hong, who put down his brush in awe. When asked about his methods, he said, "Learn from nature, gain from the heart." By the Qing Dynasty, Gao Qipei learned finger painting in his dreams, and his figures, landscapes, birds, and fish were all lifelike. From then on, finger painting began to attract attention.

Finger painting and traditional brush painting differ in medium, and the feeling they give viewers is also unique. It strengthens the thickness of the brush while eliminating its weakness. When dry, it is lively and elegant; when wet, it is vigorous and simple. It is truly magical and creates natural effects that brush painting cannot achieve.

However, most Chinese painters do not study this unique form of finger painting, and those with limited knowledge are even less able to engage in it. It requires divine insight and diligent study to master its secrets. Zhang Zitianqi of Liangxi teaches Chinese painting at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. In his spare time, he immerses himself in creating finger paintings. He has been doing this for twenty years and is skilled in finger painting. Birds, secluded birds, pine trees, plum blossoms, bamboo, and rocks, once touched by his fingers, become even more ethereal. His style is based on that of Baiyang, Xinluo, Qingteng, Nantian, and Bonian, gathering their essence and creating his own style. Judging from the dozens of completed works exhibited this time, such as No. 280 "Longevity Picture," No. 27 "Warm Jade Hall Spring," and No. 209 "Bamboo Sparrow," the compositions are unique, the sparse flowers and fine buds are charming. No. 278 "Rose Spider," No. 266 "White Lotus Dragonfly," and No. 260 "Peach Willow Oriole" have bright colors and stable positions, conveying a sense of elegance, vigor, liveliness, and antiquity. No. 114, "Lotus Pond Refreshments," was once taken to Berlin by Liu Haisu during his second European tour and eventually purchased by the German National Art Museum. A reproduction is displayed here. Although it is only a flower and a leaf, the composition does not feel simple, and the transcendent, pure interest is abundant on the paper. Several ink paintings also have a unique flavor. Li Zhongqian wrote a poem on No. 215 "Old Age Wealth and Honor": "Old age sounds like cats and butterflies in the picture, and the fragrance of heaven writes about wealth and honor. Tianqi uses his fingers instead of brushes, and the magical changes divide yin and yang." Li Zhongqian wrote a poem on No. 213 "Ink Lotus Waterfowl Picture": "Mr. Zhang paints without using a brush, and all the six methods come from his fingers. He accidentally paints a singing waterfowl, with wild water, reeds, and autumnal bleakness." Zhu Tianfan wrote a note on No. 217 "Cat Butterfly Peony": "In the past, people occasionally used their fingers for painting to pursue interest. In the Qing Dynasty, Gao Qipei of Tieling devoted himself to this art, and his realm began to expand. After Gao, few people continued to pursue it. In this painting by Tianqi, the finger technique is skillful, the ink is thick, and it has the strength of Tieling, while also incorporating the style of Qingteng and Futang. It is truly a masterpiece."

It is also important to note that Tianqi's paintings are all based on his observations of real scenes, which is different from copying ancient works or fabricating constructions. Therefore, his paintings of fish, insects, scaled creatures, beasts, and birds are lifelike. This can also serve as a warning against the common practice of imitation in the world of Chinese painting.

### Western Youth Volleyball Season Opens: Yinghua Defeated; Lost to Russian Community Team 0-2; Girls' Team Minli Defeated Shanghai Star

The 13th Western Youth Volleyball League opened at 6:45 PM last night in the association's gymnasium. The girls' team Minli vs. Shanghai Star first faced off. The rules for this year's girls' team competition have been slightly changed. Each match is 30 minutes long, with two 15-minute halves. The winner is determined by the number of points scored. In the first half of yesterday's match, Minli was very active, leading 18-5. In the second half, Shanghai Star worked hard to counterattack, and the match became tense. Although Shanghai Star scored one more point than Minli in the second half (10-9), they lost due to the excessive number of points lost in the first half, ultimately losing 15-27. In the next match, the B team Peide faced Haerhaerdeng. Peide narrowly won 2-1. Finally, the A team Yinghua faced the Russian Community Association. The starting lineup included Zheng Yiquan, whose spikes were still fierce, and Liu Zichang, whose blocks were occasionally brilliant. Mai Bingyao, however, showed signs of decline.

### America Has a Children's City

— Guo Hongdi

America has a children's city.

In the children's city, there are children's police, children's courts, children's mayors, children's newspapers, children's bands, children's factories, children's clubs, children's sports fields, children's teams, and children's photography clubs. The children's city is organized and managed by children, and it is an institution that seeks the welfare of children.

In Cleveland, America, there are six children's cities, with 3,000 citizens aged eight to eighteen. The children in the city work and play together in their spare time, practicing cooperation and learning to abide by the law. Children in the children's city gain new interests, develop new habits, and cultivate new personalities.

In 1937, there were 2,111 cases of juvenile crime in Cleveland. However, since the establishment of the children's city, the average number of juvenile crime cases has decreased to 235 per year. Citizens of the children's city pay a tax of three cents per person per month, and the total annual cost of the six children's cities is $4,000. The average annual cost per person is less than two dollars. Yes, it's a miracle, but this miracle is not accidental. This miracle can happen in America, it can happen in China, it can happen in Cleveland, and it can happen in Shanghai.

America has children's cities, and we hope that one day, China will also have children's cities, and Shanghai will also have children's cities.

### The Significance of Daycare Centers

— Yan Junfu

Daycare centers originated in the late nineteenth century and can be said to be a product of the Industrial Revolution. Their development has been driven by social needs, and these needs continue to intensify with the industrialization, modernization, and awakening of women in the country. The mode of production after the Industrial Revolution required skilled techniques rather than strong physical strength, which allowed women to participate in social production like men. On the other hand, the income of wage laborers is often calculated on an individual basis. In this situation, it is necessary for women to participate in production work. As women became aware of their independent personalities and gained experience in social work, they further recognized that achieving true equality between men and women required first seeking equality in economic capabilities. However, there are many unavoidable conflicts between career and childcare, so daycare centers came into being, shouldering two important functions. On the one hand, they assist women so that they can continue to pursue their careers, maintain their families, and devote themselves to the women's liberation movement. On the other hand, they protect children, so that they can achieve sound development in both body and mind. Daycare centers have now achieved significant development in various European and American countries.

Since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union, on the one hand, sought to establish the foundation of women's liberation, reduce obstacles to women's participation in production work, and enable them to have the same opportunities and make the same contributions as men. On the other hand, it sought to protect and train young children, ensuring that they receive full care and collective living training. Therefore, the establishment of daycare centers was included in the government's policy agenda. Various permanent, seasonal, and temporary daycare centers were established in factories, farms, schools, shops, and even parks and cinemas. There are tens of thousands of them in total, caring for millions of young children.

Charitable organizations for children in our country, such as infant asylums and orphanages, have a long history, but daycare centers are a new movement in the last decade and are not a new name for infant asylums or orphanages. It is a type of social education institution that assists families but does not replace them. This is the fundamental difference between it and infant asylums or orphanages, because the former is a charitable relief organization that fulfills the responsibility of childcare on behalf of families. Due to limitations in talent and economy, this movement has not achieved widespread development in the past decade. Before the outbreak of war, such facilities existed in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Beiping, Wuxi, and other places. Unfortunately, before the foundation could be firmly established and play a leading and exemplary role, they were cut short by the ruthless sound of gunfire. This was a major blow to this nascent movement.

Shanghai is an important industrial and commercial port, and the number of female workers and professional women is large. Under the pressure of dual tasks, their pain is self-evident. Recognizing the need for daycare centers for women in Shanghai, the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association proposed the establishment of daycare centers for professional women and daycare centers in Shanghai. After more than a year of preparation, and with the generous support of enthusiastic people from all walks of life, who either donated money and clothing or contributed their personal experience or sacrificed time and energy, these two facilities were finally able to meet people from all walks of life today, and we feel very gratified. The daycare center for professional women is located in the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association building on Mulou Road and specializes in accepting the young children of professional women for daytime care, who are picked up in the evening. The Shanghai Daycare Center is located in the Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road and specializes in accepting the children of workers for day and night care. Due to economic constraints, both facilities are very small in scale, but even so, we have deep hopes for them. We do not think of them as isolated daycare centers, but as the beginning of a socialized childcare movement. We hope that people from all walks of life will continue to provide them with material support and spiritual encouragement, so that this small life can grow strong, so that this movement can generate strength, and then expand to various production sectors and throughout the country. As we celebrate Children's Day, we are deeply fortunate to see a new dawn in the cause of children's welfare.

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(6) A Product of Love

He truly meant well, but how could Qiu Haitang tell him about this? Moreover, the more he asked, the more flustered Qiu Haitang felt inside. If it weren't for his years of experience performing on stage, he almost wouldn't have been able to conceal it.

"It's really just some small matters, Seventh Master." He tried to appear calm, as if acting in a play, and deliberately lowered his head to brush some dust off the corner of his clothes.

"Alright, then I'll leave first!" Shao Wen said as he put on his hat, walking and talking to him. "It would be best if you could go. If you really can't, it doesn't matter. Anyway, Third Uncle doesn't have anything urgent."

Usually, because Shao Wen was so comfortable moving around his house, they didn't stand on ceremony. When Shao Wen was leaving, he would just stand up and nod. But today, he made an exception and saw him to the door, feeling extremely sorry for him and, at the same time, fearing that he might turn back.

This was, of course, especially strange to Shao Wen. He kept pondering in the car, wondering why his good friend's attitude had suddenly become so unusual today.

While he was full of doubt and indecision, Qiu Haitang had already retreated into his bedroom, hastily tearing open Xiang Qi's letter. In a state of excitement that almost made him faint, he began to read it line by line.

"After you left, I spent an entire day and night without sleeping or eating. To you, I can say without any reservation: at first, my heart was indeed filled with feelings of regret and resentment, as if many people were standing in front of me, pointing and scolding me. I almost believed that I had committed a great sin! How could a woman with a husband do such a thing? Moreover, you are an actor, an actor who plays female roles..."

Reading this, Qiu Haitang's face was completely flushed. He couldn't help but deeply regret that he shouldn't have been so excited the night before, which led to the destruction of his own years of restraint and the chastity of a woman he sincerely respected and loved.

"Maybe she will never acknowledge me again!" he wondered. Could this letter be a letter of severance?

But reading the next section, Xiang Qi's tone was completely different. (71)

### Little Aviators

— Luo Wen

Among living beings, insects can be said to be the most outstanding aviators. The flight of fish seems clumsy compared to them, and airplanes are simply like heavy wooden boxes. Insects can soar in the wind, glide like gliders, and reach top speed within a second of takeoff, engaging in all sorts of amazing "performances" in the narrow air. The most skilled flying insects can even fly backward without changing the position of their bodies.

Insects' wings are naturally best suited for flying. They are extremely light. The four wings of a drone bee probably weigh only a cow's hair. But even though they are so light, they are also very strong. The front half of the wing is stronger than the back half.

Most butterflies and many moths overlap their forewings and hindwings, forming a pair of wings for flight. The two wings are connected by hooks, so they can transform into a "biplane" or a "monoplane" at will.

Insects don't just flap their wings up and down. One entomologist attached gold foil to the wingtip of a wasp and then illuminated it with a strong light. He saw the wasp's wing rotating in a figure-eight pattern.

Therefore, an insect's wing has greater efficiency than an airplane's propeller, and it also has the flight equipment of a vertical takeoff aircraft.

The "motor" that drives an insect's wing is sometimes extremely powerful. An American experimenter dissected a fly and found that its wing muscles accounted for thirty percent of its total weight.

Ms. U.D. Betts, who has conducted specialized research on the flying ability of bees, pointed out that the honeybee's "flight motor" (wing muscles) consumes a lot of fuel (i.e., honey). According to the latest surveys, a bee that flies outside must consume 30-40 milligrams of honey per hour, meaning that in a two-hour flight, a bee must eat an amount of food equal to its own weight.

### American Institute of Public Opinion

— Jin Chun

Dr. Gallup, the president of the American Institute of Public Opinion, has discovered many interesting things when investigating the thoughts of the American public. For example, he found that among the American public who participate in voting, 30 percent cannot swim. If a woman were running for president, 66 percent of the public would refuse to vote for her.

The Institute of Public Opinion has discovered many interesting things. It found that 77 percent of the American public believe that Germany should be blamed for the outbreak of this World War; it found that the American public had the most divergent opinions on the true cause of the economic depression, with consistent opinions accounting for only 5 percent of the total; it found that 40 percent of the American public do not like swing jazz music; 10 percent simply do not know what swing music is; 75 percent believe in the afterlife (only one elderly person said: he doesn't know now, but he will know soon enough). 70 percent of the public hope that the government can abolish prohibition and allow texts on contraception to be published freely; 60 percent welcome the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to stay in America forever; 6 percent are unwilling to travel to Europe by plane, even if it costs nothing.

Gallup has done various surveys and statistics. He knows which radio programs are most popular with the public and which stories in magazines attract the most attention. He found that the majority of the public love to read photos and comic strips in newspapers and magazines. Gallup also constantly adjusts and compares the American public's love and dislike of President Roosevelt and his New Deal. It's really strange. According to Gallup's surveys and statistics, President Roosevelt's popularity is related to his fishing. Every time he goes fishing, the public's affection for him increases.

### Unique Skill

— Li Liben

— One of the Best Submissions

She has a unique skill, which is "crying." This "crying" has a tune. She can add oil and vinegar to the past events and incorporate them into this crying tune. When crying, she stomps her feet and gestures wildly, sometimes sobbing and moaning, sometimes breathless and silent. If someone tries to persuade her, she will pat you on the shoulder and incorporate your affairs into the crying tune, and the crying will become even more severe. Unfortunately, this kind of crying has a drawback, which is that it cannot win the sympathy of others. The reason is very simple, which is that when she cries, the inner sadness cannot be naturally revealed. Perhaps this cry has no sadness to speak of in the heart, but is what we call "crying over the dead and scolding the living." (Response)

### Lovers Under the Sword

— Cheng Bingnu

"The Count of Monte Cristo" is a famous work by Alexandre Dumas. "Lovers Under the Sword," a sequel to "The Count of Monte Cristo," is not written by Dumas, but is conceived by Hollywood screenwriters with great care. Nevertheless, the style of the story of "Lovers Under the Sword" is no different from "The Count of Monte Cristo," and is equally bold, exciting, and imaginative.

Louis Hayward plays the protagonist, the son of the Count of Monte Cristo. He is the richest man in Europe, young and skilled at fencing. He is full of a sense of justice and loves beautiful women. This handsome character with such a blood type will undoubtedly win the love of the princess of that small country and the support of countless audiences under the screen. Joan Bennett plays the princess, graceful and luxurious, much better looking than in her fashion films. George Sanders plays a scheming dictator. In his personal acting history, "Lovers Under the Sword" can be said to be his best film.

The story tells of Joan Bennett being imprisoned in the palace by Sanders. In order to save her and her people, Louis Hayward pretends to be a naive playboy during the day, but at night, he does earth-shattering things. In terms of the story itself, it is no different from the past "Mark of Zorro" and "The Scarlet Pimpernel," but because the whole film is full of exciting action, a lighthearted tone, and rich imagination, the audience does not feel it is old-fashioned at all. The director understands the audience's psychology and often puts the two main characters in the film in precarious situations, and then unexpectedly saves them, making the audience pat their chests and shout "Dangerous!" Taking the final climax as an example, Sanders and Joan Bennett are about to get married. The screen shows them slowly walking into the church, slowly putting on the wedding ring, and the pastor slowly reciting the vows. The audience almost wants to drag Louis Hayward over. Then, Louis Hayward appears in a surprising posture, announcing Sanders' conspiracy in front of everyone. Then, with superb swordsmanship, he ends Sanders' life, and then, to the great satisfaction of the audience, the lovers finally get married.

Louis Hayward is best suited to play this kind of role. His humor and his heroism have a moving quality that is different from Tyrone Power's. Perhaps this is because he is better at acting than Tyrone Power?

### "The Two Heroes' Restoration"

— Mo Ye

While the roar of Skipon Lajin is still ringing in our ears, we accept this great gift with even more joy and pleasure.

This is a grand film that is more artistic and greater than "The Heroes' Bloody Battle"! It is the epic of the new Soviet Union and the model for millions of revolutionary comrades. Although the screenwriter used more subtitles, closer to the form of a biography, due to the proper direction and editing, we do not feel bored or dull at all during the entire performance of more than two hours. Compared to our "Confucius" (which also uses many subtitles to explain the immortal achievements of the saint!), it grasps a more tense atmosphere and makes more use of special techniques in film; these seem to be superior aspects.

We must establish a national style and national form. A nation should naturally have its own special style. In Soviet films, what is active throughout the entire screen is heavy, serious, and powerful; playfulness and nimbleness are out of the question. Because of this, we should learn how to work hard for our own glorious national art!

In the whole film, in addition to the tense atmosphere, the handling of the big scenes, those tense, dangerous, and hand-to-hand combat scenes are simply unprecedented. The struggle of thousands of people can be handled in an orderly manner, which is worthy of being an veteran director; even Hollywood can only look up to it.

Putovkin's composition of the screen is beautiful, magnificent, and majestic. In addition to this, we can hardly find any fault, and even the setting is unique. Furthermore, the way the people look up to Moscow's destruction with tears in their eyes, and the fall of various capitals, with millions of people embarking on their path of exile with disappointment, indignation, and anger, not only emotionally moves the audience and stirs people's hearts, but the composition also reaches the most excellent level, with each frame like a delicate woodcut.

The actors who play Pozharsky and Minin both perform so calmly, without any sign of affectation.

What is superfluous is perhaps the overly limited time.

### Rambling Notes from Movie City

— Wang Xuan

Ann Harding, a once-popular female star, has retired from the film industry for several years, but there are still many fans who remember her. Recently, Ann Harding married the famous musician and writer Johnson, and she may soon make a comeback and return to the screen.

"Father" Ettore Bugatti recently held a "What I Want to Be" banquet, and many big stars attended in the costumes of what they hoped to be when they were children. Bette Davis wore the costume of ballerina Pavlova, whom she had admired; Dick Powell dressed up as a streetcar conductor; his wife, Joan Blondell, dressed as a dancer from the South Pacific islands; Jackie Coogan dressed as a wealthy African tycoon; Bette Grable dressed as a Muslim woman; Bob Burns dressed as a railway engineer; Jean Hersholt dressed as a doctor; and there were other kinds of strange costumes, dazzling and extremely grand.

### Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy to Disband, "Bittersweet" to Be Their Last Work

— Yun

Singing superstars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy have collaborated six times and are highly regarded in the film industry, but news has come that, according to MGM officials, they will soon disband. However, before they part ways, the authorities have specially produced a five-color singing tragic film "Bittersweet" as a memorial. This is worth noting.

The content of "Bittersweet" tells the story of a lady from a noble family who is fascinated by music and falls in love with a musician. On the eve of her wedding, she sacrifices everything and elopes with the musician to Vienna, where she suffers all kinds of hardships and lives a miserable life. As a result, she works as a singer in a hotel to support their lives. Unexpectedly, an officer takes a fancy to her and duels with her husband, becoming a ghost under the sword, causing her to live a miserable life as a widow with a hundred years of regret.

This story is very similar to the love history of "Zhuo Wenjun's elopement with Sima Xiangru" in our ancient China. Zhuo Wenjun has become our immortal fragrant and colorful tale. The story of "Bittersweet" is equally tragic, passionate, and sorrowful. Since this is the last collaboration of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, it is very precious.

### Drama News

— Jue Xin

Lan Jutian is sick. It is said to be quite serious. Lian Yipeng told me so, saying, "In the past, if my father felt unwell, he would never collapse. This time, he is lying in bed, probably because of his age." Everyone loves and cares for this martial arts master as they love and care for Xin Fang. Upon hearing the news of his illness, they are naturally very concerned.

Yesterday afternoon, I went to Baokang Lane to visit him, but he had already gone out. According to his friend Hong Qinggui, "He overdid his training and caught a cold, but it's not very serious. Now a doctor named Ge is treating him. He and this doctor are very good friends. The doctor is afraid that he will still practice and go to the French Park, so he warned him not to go out. Therefore, he is resting in bed more."

Perhaps his performance at the Golden Grand Theater will not be affected by the illness.

### "A Midsummer Night's Dream" Scene

### A Life Philosophy of Struggle

— Zong Yu

It is not difficult to muster the spirit of struggle, but it is difficult to put down the spirit of struggle. When you want to put it down, you hold it very high. When you want to loosen it, you bind it very tightly. As the poet said, "My heart is like a knot," and you cannot be the master of yourself at all. This is because the roots in your mind have not been planted deeply. When you get into it, you feel distressed.

### Blood Rain in the Jade Garden

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 5: Red Skirts Cause Jealousy in Pomegranate Flowers

Although the end of the Ming Dynasty had the wise lord Emperor Huai, the vitality of the blood country had long been severed, like a dying patient, unable to withstand any more storms. Internally, there were natural disasters and man-made calamities; externally, there were rising strong enemies. Attacked from inside and outside, how could it not perish? The origin of the roaming bandits was caused by six types of people: first, rebellious soldiers; second, escaped soldiers; third, courier soldiers; fourth, starving people; fifth, police horses; and sixth, refugees. All started in Shaanxi and then spread everywhere. This was also because the land in the area was high and thick, the folk customs were strong and fierce, and the local officials and generals had no fixed policy of suppression and appeasement. In the beginning, they were too negligent, so that it became unmanageable once the chaos started. These things are recorded in detail and completely in the history books, and it is not difficult to read them. However, my book also has a small relationship with the roaming bandits, so I have to describe it very briefly. At first, Yue Dangqiao was the governor of Shaanxi, and Mi Tongmeng was the governor of Yansui, both of whom were extremely greedy and abused the people. In addition, there were consecutive years of drought, and refugees had nowhere to beg for food, so they came out to plunder food. The outlaws in the forest stirred up trouble, and the rebellious soldiers and escaped soldiers joined in, so they rioted everywhere, and the situation was about to burn the plains. At that time, there were many bandits such as Little Red Wolf, One Zhangqing, Hunjianglong, Lue Dihu, Mantianfei, Dian Dengzi, Li Laochai, Huntu Hou, and Duxinglang, rising like wind and clouds everywhere. The government army attacked from the east and west, but could not put them out. Among them, the most powerful were Zhang Xianzhong of Yan'an and Li Zicheng of Mizhi. Zhang Xianzhong called himself the Eighth Grand King; Li Zicheng called himself General Chuang. Although Emperor Huai sent Yang He, Hong Chengchou, Sun Chuanting, and others to suppress them one after another, the more they suppressed, the more chaotic it became, and they could not be stopped. They were finally trampled on by the roaming bandits in the Central Plains, causing a deep concern that led to the fall of the country. The generals at that time were not without the crime of harming the country. It is a pity that there were two good opportunities to capture and kill Zhang and Li. If one of them died, perhaps the roaming bandits would not be difficult to gradually put out. Unfortunately, the person in charge missed the opportunity, and they were able to survive from desperation and make a comeback. (28)
