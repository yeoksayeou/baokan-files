### Yesterday Afternoon at 2 PM: Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact Signed; Rumor of Japanese Guarantee of Outer Mongolian Territorial Integrity; Soviet Union Makes Similar Guarantee Regarding Manchuria

Moscow, today at 2 PM, the Soviet Union and Japan signed a neutrality pact. The pact was signed by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka representing Japan, and Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov representing the Soviet Union. (United Press report from the 13th)

Tokyo, Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement tonight stating that the treaty signed by Japan and the Soviet Union in Moscow today can promote the restoration of peace in the world. Konoe declared that today the Soviet Union and Japan jointly issued a statement in Moscow stating that Japan guarantees the territorial integrity and inviolability of Outer Mongolia, and the Soviet Union makes the same guarantee regarding Manchuria. Konoe stated that the new agreement will serve as the basis for the expeditious and concrete resolution of various issues. (United Press report from the 13th)

Washington, Prime Minister Konoe's statement that Japan's foreign policy will remain unchanged after Foreign Minister Matsuoka's return from Europe is viewed here as a very cautious statement and not surprising. Informed sources believe that this shows Japan's unwillingness to join the European war, which is similar to the situation before Matsuoka's trip to Europe. The Axis leaders failed to entice Japan to join the war at this time. At the same time, Japan does not want to adjust its relationship with the United States but will wait and see. Matsuoka's long stay in Moscow during his return trip and his frequent meetings with Soviet leaders make it possible to believe the opinion held here before Matsuoka left Japan that the real purpose of his trip was to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations, which is also related to efforts to end the war against China. Many believe that Japan has two objectives towards the Soviet Union: first, to establish a sense of security regarding the border of the three northeastern provinces; second, to reduce Soviet aid to China in order to offset the aid China receives from the United States. However, those familiar with Far Eastern affairs do not believe that the Soviet-Japanese talks will have any results because they believe that the Soviet Union is deeply concerned that Germany will attack, so it is still willing to see Japan mired in China, thereby reducing the harm that Soviet Far Eastern interests may suffer.

### Matsuoka Has Long Talk with Stalin Before Leaving Moscow

Berlin, German News Agency Moscow dispatch states that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka continued to discuss Soviet-Japanese relations with Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last night for two hours. Matsuoka is scheduled to take the Siberian train back home starting Sunday, so he went to the Kremlin to bid farewell. This was the second meeting between Matsuoka and Stalin. Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa also attended the meeting. The first meeting was on March 20th. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)

Moscow, Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka met with Stalin again yesterday. Stalin had first decided to meet with Matsuoka at the Kremlin several weeks ago. Stalin rarely meets with foreign envoys, so it is rare to meet twice in a few weeks. Japanese Ambassador Lieutenant General Tatekawa and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov were also present at the time. Matsuoka spoke with Stalin for as long as two hours. Afterwards, a Japanese spokesperson issued a statement stating that Matsuoka "expressed his deepest gratitude for Mr. Stalin's interview. His short stay in the Soviet Union this time will be beneficial in clarifying Soviet-Japanese relations." Matsuoka spent his sixth day in the Soviet Union yesterday, mostly engaged in so-called cultural exploration. He visited a machine factory and a geological college. Last night, he went to the Art Theater to watch Chekhov's "Three Sisters." Ambassador Tatekawa also privately invited Foreign Minister Matsuoka to lunch. (United Press report from the 13th)

Tokyo, Durand, a correspondent for the New York Times in Moscow, recently traveled to Japan. He recently had a detailed discussion with a reporter from the Japan Times about the Soviet Union's attitude, stating briefly that the Soviet Union's foreign policy, whether towards Japan or the Balkans, is to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool of war, so it will not participate in the war unless attacked. Recently, Matsuoka is meeting with Stalin in Moscow, and there is a possibility of improving Soviet-Japanese relations. It is reported that Durand was sent to the Soviet Union in 1921 to serve as a correspondent for the New York Times, and he did not leave the Soviet Union until 1934. He was sent to Moscow again last year and has been there ever since. (Havas report from the 13th)

Hungarian Troops Invade Southern Country; Soviet Union Issues Strong Condemnation; Warns Hungary Not to Forget It Also Possesses Ethnic Minorities; Public Believes This to Be an Indirect Slap in Germany's Face

Moscow, yesterday, Hungarian Minister to the Soviet Union Kristoffy visited Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky. Mr. Kristoffy, representing the Hungarian government, stated the reasons for the Hungarian troops' arrival in Yugoslavia and expressed the hope that the Soviet government would recognize the legitimacy of the Hungarian actions. Mr. Vyshinsky replied as follows: If the Hungarian government's subsequent statements are intended to request the Soviet government to express its opinion, then I would like to state on behalf of the Soviet government that the Soviet government cannot agree with this action by the Hungarian side. The fact that Hungary is at war with the southern country, only four months after the signing of a friendship agreement between the two countries, gives the Soviet Union a bad impression. As far as we know, Hungary also has ethnic minorities. If it is also drawn into the whirlpool, it is not difficult for us to imagine what its situation will be." The Hungarian Minister agreed to convey the above reply to the Hungarian government immediately. (TASS dispatch from the 13th)

Moscow, the Soviet Union announced last night that it may take action in the Balkans to counter Hungary under German influence and strongly condemned the Hungarian government for taking advantage of the southern country's crisis to invade its territory. Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyshinsky told the Hungarian Minister to the Soviet Union yesterday that Hungary should not forget the ethnic minorities of Ukrainian and Little Russian descent who still reside within Hungary. He also said, "Hungary and the southern country signed a treaty of perpetual friendship just four months ago, and the Soviet Union does not think it is right to go to war with the southern country." According to the official report read by the Moscow radio station, Mr. Vyshinsky also told the Hungarian Minister, "Since Hungary has ethnic minorities, it is not difficult to understand what Hungary's position would be if it were not attacked in times of difficulty." This remark, as interpreted by the public, is tantamount to an indirect slap in Germany's face and implies a possibility of threat, that is, the Red Army may take action to "protect" the Slavic residents of the Carpathian Outer Region. The area was seized from Czechoslovakia by Hungary two years ago. If the Soviet Union explores this method, it can be regarded as retaliation for Hungary's entry into the southern country and can support the southern country in resisting the invasion of Germany and Italy.

### Turkish Diplomats Believe Germany Will Put Pressure on Turkey; Germany's Ultimate Goal Is India and the Far East; People's Hearts Slightly Settled After German Troops Withdraw from Turkish Border

Istanbul, diplomatic officials here stated yesterday that they believe that the ultimate goal of the Germans' eastward advance is to deal with Turkey, India, and the Far East. These people are gradually convinced that the Germans may try to put pressure on Turkey in the spring as a preliminary step to attacking Mosul. These people say that Turkey is gradually becoming the center of Nazi pressure, and the ultimate goal of the German army is India and the Far East. Germany's pressure on Turkey is already underway. When the Fifth Column spread the news that Germany and Turkey were about to conclude a non-aggression treaty, Germany's pressure on Turkey had already begun. Following the above news, there was also news that Germany and Turkey were conducting negotiations on a trade agreement worth 10 million pounds. According to Ankara news, Germany has not made any proposals to Turkey other than expressing friendship, and the reported news is to confuse the public. (United Press report from the 13th)

Istanbul, the troops of Germany and Bulgaria have withdrawn ten kilometers from the vicinity of the Turkish border, which has slightly eased the tense situation here. After Germany launched its offensive on the 16th of this month, the country ordered the evacuation of residents of this city, which caused great turmoil in the business community. As a result, the currency price plummeted. The retreat of the German and Bulgarian troops has slightly settled people's hearts, but in general, it is believed that the Turkish border guards may not retreat with them. (Havas report from the 13th)

Budapest, although the rumors that Germany will sign a non-aggression agreement with Turkey have not been confirmed, the general public here believes that Germany and Turkey will sign a commercial treaty in the next few days. According to the National Socialist Party's organ, "Neues Wiener Tagblatt," the fate of the Balkan Peninsula will depend on the great war near Mount Olympus in Greece. At present, the German army is only thirty-five miles away from the Dardanelles Strait in Turkey, but the Turkish government has not yet reacted in any way. (Havas report from the 13th)

### British Staff Officers Leave Turkey and Return to Egypt

Ankara, British Air Force Major General Elmhurst, Army Major General Cripps, and Deputy Major General Pollock have left for Egypt after participating in talks with the Turkish General Staff. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)

### On Easter Day, the Pope Broadcasts, Speaking of Belligerent Countries Considering Humanitarianism, Not Using Terrible Weapons

Vatican City, Pope Pius XII made an Easter broadcast today, urging all warring countries not to use terrible weapons, and the Pope seemed to be referring to poison gas. The Pope also appealed for good treatment of prisoners of war and civilians in occupied areas. The Pope sadly expressed doubt that there is still hope for a peaceful resolution, but he officially stated that he will continue to work hard for peace. Although the Pope expressed regret for the horrors of war, he said, "We must recognize the loyalty of those who fight for their country." The Pope especially mentioned wartime refugees in his Easter blessing to the world. Vatican officials announced that the Pope's speech had been shortened by ten minutes because the Pope, in view of recent developments in Yugoslavia, felt that directly appealing for peace was useless, so he revised that part of the speech. (United Press report from the 13th)

### Hull Delivers Speech on Pan American Day

Washington, US Secretary of State Hull issued the following statement on Pan American Day today, stating that the American people should unite more closely with the American republics on this Pan American Commemoration Day, reaffirming their determination to protect freedom and justice, and build independent countries in the new world. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)

### There Will Be No War Between Japan and the United States This Year: A Personal Observation by an American Reporter

San Francisco, International News Service reporter Major, who arrived here from Manila aboard the President Taft, said, "Chinese or Japanese people think that Japan and the United States will go to war this year. I think there is no basis for this. The Japanese Navy may be forced to take risks and attack in the Pacific, but the Japanese Navy is more stable than the Army and may not rashly provoke a war. Although soldiers from the east may start a major war, I think it will not be realized." (International News Service dispatch from the 13th)

### The Danish Envoy Who Signed a Treaty with the United States Is Dismissed by the Government; The United States Will Use 30 Danish Ships Seized to Transport War Materials to Supply England and Southern Countries

Washington, the Danish delegation here yesterday said that the issue of whether Danish Minister Kaufmann stays or leaves will be decided by US Secretary of State Hull. According to reports, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned him back because Kaufmann signed the Greenland Agreement with President Roosevelt. (United Press report from the 12th)

Copenhagen, Danish Ambassador to the United States Kauffmann, who signed the Greenland Agreement, has been dismissed. (Haitong News Agency report from the 13th)

Berlin, people here believe that the Danish government has not recognized the agreement signed by the United States and the Danish Minister regarding the construction of military bases in Greenland. According to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Danish government has never issued such instructions. Regarding the news that the United States has allowed ships to enter the Red Sea, the German side believes that this plan to transport war materials to supply the southern countries was heard a few days ago, but the development of the Balkan war situation has made this plan ineffective. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)

Copenhagen, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday issued a statement stating that it refused to recognize the Greenland Agreement signed by the Danish Minister to the United States without authorization with the US government, solemnly pointing out that the Danish government is not bound by this agreement, and stating that Danish Minister to the United States Kauffmann has been dismissed for signing the illegal agreement with the United States without authorization. The content of the declaration briefly states that, according to a telegram from the United States, the US government has decided to take measures to protect Greenland and build naval and air bases there because Germany has expanded the war zone to Greenland's territorial waters. However, this agreement was signed by US Secretary of State Hull and Danish Minister to the United States Kauffmann, and it was not signed with a special envoy of the Danish King or government, and the Danish King and government did not know anything about this matter in advance. Therefore, according to international law, this agreement has no legal basis and cannot be established at all. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)

Washington, it is reported that the Danish government, under German instructions, does not recognize the new agreement between the United Kingdom and Denmark to defend Greenland. According to reliable sources, the US government will ignore Denmark's protest. Reliable sources say that although the Danish government summoned Danish Ambassador to the United States Kaufman, who had concluded the agreement, to show its displeasure, Kaufman refused to comply, and a government spokesperson officially stated that Denmark's action was clearly due to German pressure and would therefore be considered invalid. It is alleged that Kaufman may serve as the head of the Danish government in exile in the United States, handling Danish-American affairs on his own, including the transfer of Danish ships. The frozen Danish assets can be freely disposed of by Kaufman. The above paragraph is likely to be realized, and the United States will expedite the Greenland base plan. (International Telegram from the 13th)

Washington, well-informed sources say that the 30 Danish merchant ships recently seized in American ports will be used to load American war materials, travel through the Red Sea, and supply the needs of the United Kingdom and the Erkan countries. The Danish crew members are now very willing to sail to the Red Sea, but they advocate flying their own national flag instead of the American flag. Many believe that a legal ruling from the Chief Justice is required before the Danish ships can sail to the Red Sea, but the loading will not be delayed because of this, because it is expected that all legal procedures can be resolved by the time the ships leave the port. Some American ships currently engaged in trade in East Africa will expand their routes so that they can sail to Egyptian ports south of the Suez. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)

Copenhagen, it is reported that the Danish government is drafting a wide-ranging protest to the United States because the United States has taken over the defense of Greenland, demanding that the country respect Greenland's "integrity" and proposing to recall Danish Minister to the United States Kauffmann.

Editorial

### Further Discussion on the Balkan War and the Soviet Union

With the expansion of the Balkan War, there have been various startling rumors about the Soviet Union's actions in recent days. For example, the International News Service recently reported that Soviet personnel in London strongly condemned the Nazis, and the Ankara telegram speculated that the Soviet Union would take extraordinary measures. Although such news has a certain degree of psychological warfare flavor and cannot be fully relied upon as credible history, it does express the world's eager anticipation of the Soviet Union at this moment. At a time when Hitler's military power is moving eastward, Churchill's speech pointing out that Germany seems to be trying to obtain Ukrainian granaries and Caucasian oil fields is precisely the intention that has already been displayed in Mein Kampf. Looking at the Soviet Union's intentions, it has shown great concern for the recent evolution of the situation in the Balkans, such as condemning the actions of Bulgaria and Hungary as accomplices and encouraging Turkey and the southern countries to resist aggression with strength based on their non-aggression agreements. All of this proves that the Soviet Union has fully used its opposition to the Nazi use of troops in the Balkans, and the only thing lacking is a public break.

Looking at the progress of the European War, although the initial battles broke out near the Soviet border, they soon turned and expanded on the Western Front. Even though the Soviet-German non-aggression agreement failed to fully ensure the safety of the Soviet Union's western border in the early stages of the European War, and Soviet forces had to rely on fighting against Finland and annexing the three small countries to consolidate its national defense, during the period from the start of the Norwegian war last spring to the intensification of the air raids on Britain in the autumn, no European country had the extra strength or possibility to invade the Soviet Union. After the stalemate in the Battle of the English Channel, Hitler turned to actively managing the Middle East and Europe to consolidate his strength, and swept up several small countries in one fell swoop. The situation between the Soviet Union and Germany has completely changed from before the outbreak of the European War. First, the previous countries of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and even the two small countries of Lithuania, were buffer states between the Soviet Union and Germany, allowing both sides to avoid direct contact. Today, these countries have either been merged by both sides or have formed Nazi vassals, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea outlet. The two countries are almost completely directly adjacent. After the German army recently invaded Eastern Thrace, the Bosporus Strait, the gateway to the Soviet Union's southern border, is almost similar to Leningrad before the Soviet-Finnish War. If the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War was only to consolidate Leningrad's strategic position, then the current situation in the Bosporus deserves serious consideration by the Soviet Union. Second, before the war, Germany's national power was clearly inferior to that of the combined forces of Britain and France, and even when compared with the Soviet Union, it was only on par. However, in the past year, the Nazis have conquered the entire European continent, forming a vast European empire unprecedented in the hundred and several decades since Napoleon. Although it has no other concerns with the Soviet Union during its continued war against Britain, if it defeats Britain one day, it will inevitably form a great threat to the Soviet Union. Third, the essence of the Tripartite Pact is only the strengthening of the anti-communist public pact, and for practical reasons, it cannot but formally and clearly define its relationship with the Soviet Union in the document, in order to avoid causing Soviet unease. In fact, these deceptive tricks cannot completely deceive the Soviet Union. Now that German military power is gradually approaching the east, and the Japanese authorities have clearly stated that they want to include the Siberian Railway within the scope of the so-called East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the anti-communist and anti-Soviet nature of the Tripartite Pact is gradually becoming apparent. Recently, even though the Soviet Union has hinted at its opposition to the Nazi invasion of the Balkans with various attitudes and actions, the German side has gone its own way and ignored them. This has clearly proven that these indirect warnings to Germany have no effect whatsoever.

The Soviet Union's consistent policy towards the European War is neutrality and self-preservation. Even though the recent facts are such and it has gradually become impatient, its actions have not exceeded the scope of neutrality and self-preservation. The recent conclusion of the Soviet-German oil agreement and the imminent completion of the Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations all indicate that unless there is an unexpected major change, the Soviet Union's consistent policy will continue to be maintained. But in reality, this is only passive and defensive. It has its own considerable value for countries that keep their word and abide by treaties, but it is definitely not an effective policy to deal with today's aggressor countries. Hitler, of course, does not want to excessively stimulate Soviet sentiment at this moment and may make considerable concessions in small matters, such as withdrawing German troops from the Turkish-Greek border, in order to avoid the escalation of Soviet-German relations. However, unless the Nazis ultimately fail completely, we believe that even these concessions will be compensated for in the future. British and Turkish public opinion both believe that now is the best opportunity for the Soviet Union to come out and intervene in the European War. Whether for the sake of the Soviet Union itself or for the future of mankind, the Soviet Union should not be satisfied with neutrality and self-preservation. If the Soviet authorities believe that the time for action has not yet matured, at the very least, they should take effective countermeasures on the passive side to stop countries such as Hungary and Bulgaria from acting as accomplices, and on the active side, do their best to promote Turkey's immediate fulfillment of its treaty obligations to England, Greece, and the southern countries, in order to use its strength to stop the advance of Nazi forces towards the tip of the Balkans and the gateway to the Black Sea.

### Ireland to Purchase Military Supplies from the U.S.; U.S. Will Extend the Lend-Lease Act to Make It Applicable to Ireland As Well

Washington: It was learned here yesterday that the United States may extend the Lend-Lease Act to Ireland so that it can cooperate more closely with Britain. This is related to recent rumors that Ireland is purchasing food and military supplies from the U.S. This move will allow Ireland to provide bases for Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. Irish Minister of Defense Aiken is currently in Washington to purchase food and military supplies sufficient to arm 200,000 people. It is reported that, so far, he has not accepted assistance under the Lend-Lease Act. (13th United Press dispatch)

### Fierce Fighting in Northern Greece All Day; German Offensive Meets Resistance; Heavy Casualties on Both Sides in Mechanical Engagements; Reports of the Fall of Larissa Unconfirmed

Athens: Official sources here announced last night that the valiant Greek army, under the cover of British armored forces, launched a fierce counterattack north of the city of Kilkis and Florina yesterday, routing large numbers of German tanks, motorcycles, and infantry, who fled in all directions. This decisive Easter victory was disclosed in a special communiqué issued by the Greek Intelligence Department. It is said that a strong German column descended from the Monastir Gorge, advanced towards Florina, attempting to attack the western flank of the Anglo-Greek defense line, but was completely routed. It is said that since the German mechanized forces broke through the Monastir Gorge and entered northern and central Greece, the Germans have suffered heavy casualties in their first setback, with significant losses in tanks and other vehicles. (13th International dispatch)

London: It is reported that in the past twenty-four hours, the air forces and armored vanguards of both Britain and Germany have systematically attacked each other, destroying each other's concentration points and lines of communication, preventing them from engaging in a major battle. According to reports from Athens and Istanbul, Yugoslavia has launched an extremely fierce counterattack and retaken Skopje. The resistance of the South Army is very strong, and the German losses are very heavy in the mountain warfare. The British air attacks were concentrated on the German concentration points in Veles, Prilep, and Kicevo (all in southern Yugoslavia), as the German armored forces advanced from those places to the Monastir Pass and south to Florina in Greece. British vanguards and armored forces in the Monastir area also stormed a German assembly point, reportedly destroying a German unit. The British air force also bombed the communication centers of Kilkis and Gevgelija. German and Italian communiqués both stated that the German and Italian armies were implementing the initial plans for a major battle, trying to destroy the concentration points of the Anglo-Greek Allied forces before the decisive battle. (13th United Press dispatch)

Athens: It is reported that after inflicting a fierce blow on the vanguard of the German mechanized forces, the main force of the Anglo-Greek army is now engaged in a full-scale battle with the German army, which is launching a full-force attack on the main Anglo-Greek defense line. According to Athens radio reports, "Generally speaking, regardless of whether the German armored forces have encountered resistance from the Greek army, they have indeed been blocked by the Greek army. The central Greek front is currently being held by the main force of the Anglo-Greek army, so the advancing German army has now encountered a strong barrier." Athens radio then described the terrible battle from Florina to Giannitsa. It is said that the Anglo-Greek forces repelled a large vanguard of German tanks, motorcycles, and infantry in that area. It is reported that swift-moving Anglo-Greek armored vehicles destroyed many German tanks on the Giannitsa Plain. Giannitsa (also known as Yenice) is twenty-eight miles west of Thessaloniki. It is said that the German army intends to break through the right flank of the Anglo-Greek army in order to attack Larissa. (13th International dispatch)

New York: Columbia Broadcasting Company received a German message broadcast by its correspondent Burke in Ankara, Turkey, stating that on Friday, the German army broke through the Anglo-Greek Olympus defense line and occupied Larissa, an important railway city in Greece. If this news is true, then the German army has defeated the right flank of the Anglo-Greek forces in the Olympus Mountains. Larissa is only about one hundred and forty miles from Athens. (13th International News Agency dispatch)

Berlin: According to unconfirmed reports, the British army has retreated to the second line of defense and is preparing to withdraw from Greece. Since the fall of Thessaloniki, news of the battle has suddenly gone silent. It is not yet known whether the British army has made contact with the German army. The British army's second line of defense is between Larissa and Ioannina. If this is true, it indicates that the Anglo-Greek Allied forces have been forced to abandon the Olympus Mountain defense line because their left flank is threatened. (13th United Press dispatch)

### South Army Launches a Vigorous Counterattack in Southwestern Serbia

London: It was learned here yesterday from a radio station in Ankara that Serbian troops have occupied Durazzo, the key port of the Albanian Italian army. Durazzo is east of Tirana, the capital of Albania, and has been the target of Greek attacks since the Italian-Greek War. (13th United Press)

New York: According to Greek sources, Yugoslav troops have launched a vigorous counterattack southwest of the city of Skopje. Although the German army is resisting fiercely, the South Army is still able to advance southward. (13th Havas dispatch)

Athens: Radio reports that the South Army has launched a counterattack northwest of Ruse, and is strengthening its resistance everywhere. A large force of the South Army is now advancing southward in the central region, gradually breaking through the German army's attempts to stop its advance. (13th Reuters dispatch)

Berlin: The High Command announced at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon (11:00 PM Shanghai time) that after six days of fighting, Führer Hitler's Balkan troops had broken through the entire resistance of the South Army in the country's north, center, and south, and are advancing rapidly towards the southern capital, Belgrade, to encircle it. As of today, the news that the southern capital has fallen, which has been widely rumored in the past twelve hours, has not been officially confirmed. The High Command acknowledged that although the South Army had suffered a major blow in the past forty-eight hours, the South still managed to maintain a definite line of defense, and the fighting was unprecedentedly fierce. The High Command also said that the invasion of southern territory by Hungarian troops from the north is obvious. The main body of the South Army's resistance has been pushed towards Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Montenegro, where the three South Army units are fighting behind the Adriatic Sea, gradually gathering together under German pressure. (13th United Press dispatch)

Berlin: According to authoritative sources here, at least fourteen divisions of the South Army have been completely annihilated by the German army since the outbreak of the war. (13th Haitong dispatch)

Budapest: The U.S. Vice-Consul Mr. Holzweser, who recently visited the southern capital of Yugoslavia and returned here today, announced that civilian casualties were heavy during the bombing of Belgrade last week. On Friday, there were many corpses lying in the streets, and municipal work was seriously hampered, so there is no reliable estimate of the total number of casualties. The commercial area and railway station of the city suffered heavy damage. (13th United Press dispatch)

### German and Italian Armies Meet in Southern Yugoslavia; Greek Army Still Holds Albanian Territory

Italian troops advancing from Albania continued to clear the remnants of the enemy in the occupied area around Lake Ohrid. (13th Haitong dispatch)

Vichy: Greece acknowledged that German and Italian troops had met in Ohrid, which is located twelve miles from the Italian-Greek border in the mountains north of Korytsa, west of Monastir. However, Greece still insisted that there was a continuous Anglo-Greek line from Kyparissia on the Adriatic Sea to the Gulf of Thessaloniki, and had not been breached by the German or Italian armies. The Greek side also claimed that the defeat of the South Army did not expose the flanks of the Anglo-Greeks. (13th United Press)

### British Aircraft Active, Harassing German Army; Athens Raided for Four Hours

Athens: German bombers and laying aircraft were active over the Greek defense lines for more than four hours yesterday, and Athens opened the most fierce and dramatic night battle, with raids lasting four hours. Squads of German aircraft constantly flew over the suburbs, then dove down into the center of the capital in a sharp, unparalleled posture, carrying out extensive bombing. Two German aircraft were shot down and crashed in flames. At the same time, Royal Air Force bombers continued to bomb the advancing German army. According to a statement, "The German army concentrated in Veles, Prilep, and Kilkis was heavily bombed, but the weather at the time was extremely bad, so the results of the attack are unknown." The statement also said that a large German motorized transport column was heading north to Kilkis in the dark, but our air force machine-gunned it, causing great chaos, and many trucks caught fire and burned. Traffic in Galimeni was also bombed. Another bomber, ignoring the attack of a large number of German aircraft, destroyed the important bridge at Polikastron. (13th United Press dispatch)

### Robao is also about to follow Hungary's lead and risk conflict by sending troops into the South

Berlin. A German spokesperson assessed Hungary's reclaiming of former territories in the South, suggesting other countries might follow suit with military intervention. Berlin is currently focused on military developments, while future political developments remain uncertain. Regarding the status of the Croat people, the spokesperson indicated that their livelihoods and cultural development would be guaranteed in the future. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Belgrade. Local newspapers today began criticizing the chaos in the South and the lack of protection for its citizens, who are subjected to terror. It is widely believed that Bao will soon follow Hungary's example and send troops into the South to "protect" its residents and "re-demand" the Macedonian region of the South. (International News Agency, 13th)

Rome. The Stefani News Agency claims that Yugoslavia continues to create disturbances on the southern Romanian border. Southern border guards previously opened fire on Romanian border guards, prompting Romanian retaliation. As a result, six Southern soldiers were injured and ten were captured. According to the prisoners, they heard that Romania had declared war on Yugoslavia. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Continue advancing to fight on the upper reaches of the Sava River. However, another Italian army unit departed from the Italian port of Trieste and is advancing towards the Dalmatia region of the South. In addition, the Southern army is also blocking German General Kleit's troops from linking up with the main German force in two locations: south of the city of Nis in the south (upper reaches of the Morava River) and the lower reaches of the Vardar River. The German troops in the mountains west of Taiduvocheng on the Vardar River attempted to link up with the Italian army but encountered strong resistance at the Galkiniq Pass. The German High Command then ordered the German army to attack Ohrid from Monastir to link up with the Italian army. Several German soldiers are currently repairing the railway and highway from the port of Thessaloniki to the capital of Yugoslavia to speed up military operations, as the current transportation line runs from the Hungarian capital to the Bao capital, which is a long journey and not as convenient as this railway line.

### French Military Expert Observes the War Situation: British and German Strengths Compete, Victory is Uncertain

Vichy. A local military observer recently stated that after the British and German forces made contact on the plains from Monastir in southern Yugoslavia to Florina in northern Greece, the Balkan war is likely to escalate into a large-scale war. Furthermore, with the two armies fighting on level ground, both sides have an equal chance of winning. Both sides possess powerful mechanized units. The outcome of the battle will inevitably lead to the complete destruction of one side's mechanized units, forcing them to resort to infantry. Both sides have considerable experience in mechanized warfare. For example, the German army has fought several battles in Poland and France, while the British army has repeatedly fought with the Italian army in Libya. In terms of the German operational plan, they are advancing from Monastir in southern Yugoslavia in two directions: (1) One route crosses the southern border and attacks Florina in northern Greece. If this route succeeds, it could force the British army to retreat from Florina and then use the city as a base to flank the Greek army in Albania. (2) The other route advances southwest towards Vifo in Greece. If successful, it could open a path in the Vardar River basin and west of the port of Thessaloniki to penetrate the Daissalonike Mountains in northwestern Greece. As the major Greek campaign is underway, the Yugoslav army is fighting alone in the north, and the situation is gradually deteriorating. Before retreating to the western and southern mountains, the Serbian army suffered heavy losses. Although the Southern army is currently fighting desperately to stop the main German force from advancing, it does not seem to have the strength to stop the German armored vehicles and motorized units. In addition, part of the Southern army is currently blocking the Italian army from advancing north of the port of Zagreb and east of the city of Lubiana. After occupying the city of Lubiana, the Italian army has been unable to cross the mountains.

### German Planes Bomb British Escort Ships; HMS Essexston Damaged

London. Officials recently released details of an attack by 50 German aircraft on a British escort fleet, resulting in damage to the British destroyer HMS Essexston. It is said that more than 20 German aircraft dove towards HMS Essexston and dropped 30 bombs, only three of which hit. The German aircraft, seeing that the ship had been hit, assumed it had been destroyed and turned to attack merchant ships. Unexpectedly, the damaged ship continued to fire, shooting at them. At that time, another British destroyer, which was spotted by German aircraft, also bombarded the German aircraft. The German aircraft then fled together and disappeared completely in a few minutes. The escort fleet was able to sail safely without any damage, while HMS Essexston was towed into a British port for repairs and will soon return to escort duty. (Reuters, 13th)

### Soviet Union's Far East Merchant Fleet Plans to Restore Far East Shipping; Many Ships Have Come to Shanghai for Repairs; Trade Expansion Has Also Begun

According to the Japanese-language Mainichi News, recently, Soviet ships have arrived in Shanghai via land routes. The ships that arrived in Shanghai in February included the Smolny (transliteration), weighing 3,173 tons, the Komunsk (transliteration), weighing 2,661 tons, and the Indosleya, weighing 5,326 tons. The ships that arrived in Shanghai in March included the Sukiyes Zito, weighing 4,600 tons, and the Coruche, weighing 3,974 tons. The ships that arrived in Shanghai in April included the Wuakehai, weighing 2,338 tons, and the Korida, weighing 1,671 tons. The ships belonging to the Far East Merchant Fleet are arriving in Shanghai one after another for repairs. Ships can travel between Sakhalin Island and Shanghai once every 20 days, engaging in Sino-Soviet trade. This situation has not occurred in the past five years, so all parties are paying close attention to the movements of Soviet ships. It is rumored that 21 more Soviet ships are scheduled to arrive in the next 18 months. The Soviet government will also send several personnel to Shanghai to supervise ship repairs, and they will temporarily reside in the Soviet Consulate General. According to observations by Soviet personnel in Shanghai, these ships coming to Shanghai for repairs do not currently have any implications for Japan or communist activities in the current Japan-Soviet relations. Since the outbreak of the European War, British and American ships have retreated in the Far East, so the Soviet Far East Merchant Fleet is taking the opportunity to restore Far East shipping and expand Far East trade.

### Strict Security on the Borders of the Two Concessions

The Public Concession Police originally erected barbed wire fences on various roads outside the concession in the west of Shanghai, such as Jessfield Road, Yu Yuan Road, and Da Xi Road, to assist in maintaining public order. After the establishment of the "Special Police Department" in the west of Shanghai, the barbed wire fences have now been moved to Jing'an Temple Road, in front of Jing Shou Temple, and Da Xi Road at the end of Foch Road. In addition to a large number of Chinese and Western police officers stationed there, a White Russian reserve team is also standing at the gaps in the barriers with guns, selectively inspecting pedestrians and vehicles entering and exiting.

### French Concession Borders Blocked

The security situation in the French Concession border area is even stricter. Eight French defense soldiers, six armed police officers, and one female inspector have been added next to the cement bunker at the intersection of Shanzhong Road and Haig Road. In addition, the Police Department has set up barbed wire fences along Haig Road on various unnecessary lanes and roads on Haig Road, and stationed one Chinese policeman and one outside concession policeman. All pedestrians and vehicles must detour back and forth to enter and exit.

His words were like blossoming lotuses, and his profound principles were endless, captivating the audience. It is said that the second lecture will be held in a week, focusing on science.

### A Panorama of the United States Navy

With the situation on the Pacific Ocean becoming increasingly tense, a US-Japan war seems imminent. The full picture of the United States Navy is of concern to readers. Based on the materials in the "Special Issue on the United States Navy" compiled by "Life" magazine, we have selected the following for translation.

Assuming that the United States were to fight at sea in mid-1941, its fleet would consist of the following warships: 12 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 18 heavy cruisers armed with 8-inch guns, 19 light cruisers armed with 6-inch guns, 75 old-style destroyers, 88 new-style destroyers, and 40 long-range submarines. Among these many warships, excluding those used for transportation, supply, attacking enemy ships, and those being repaired and refreshed in shipyards, as well as those damaged by enemy submarines or bombers during combat, the entire fleet represents the naval strength of the United States.

### Majestic Appearance of the US Battleship "Idaho"

The naval strength of the United States is quite large. Compared with the navies of Britain or Japan, it is in a ratio of 9-5-4. Although the number of American warships is slightly less than that of Britain, their power is greater. If they were to line up for battle, they might be able to win. However, if the central army uses blockades or small-scale battles, the United States could lose the war if not handled well. Compared with the navy of Japan, the power is naturally more than sufficient. American battleships are slower in speed than Japanese ones, but the steel armor is much thicker, and the sailing ability is far superior. American naval aircraft carriers are three times more capable than those of Japan. The firepower of light cruisers is greater than that of Japan. Destroyers are larger in tonnage and faster in speed.

The US fleet is divided into two parts: reconnaissance and combat. The reconnaissance department, composed of heavy cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and aircraft, is responsible for finding the enemy's location. The combat department includes all ships and is dedicated to attacking the enemy. Battleships have the greatest power. Unless they are sunk by the enemy first, they can sink the enemy ship within 15 minutes if they find it. American battleships can fire three volleys per minute, sending eight tons of gunpowder and steel towards the enemy. Therefore, Americans are confident that their battleships can definitely overwhelm the enemy when attacking.

During naval battles, the cruisers are responsible for finding enemy ships, and light cruisers are responsible for deterring enemy ships from attacking. Destroyers lay mines against the enemy's giant ships, search for enemy submarines, and protect the entire fleet in combat.

In addition to warships, the navy also has aircraft to scout and bomb the enemy, chase enemy planes in the air, and observe the fire situation of their warships. The naval fleet is not only a direct tool for fighting the enemy, but also a self-sufficient organization. It has its own rescue ships, repair ships, fast oil tankers, and submarine ferries. It even has a streamlined combat army, namely the so-called Marine Corps.

(1) Great Battleships

Battleships are floating fortresses on the sea, designed to carry large cannons and attack the enemy with fierce firepower. All equipment on the ship is based on the premise of achieving this goal. All the thick and thin steel plates on the ship must be able to protect the cannons on the ship. The large engine in the ship must be able to move the large battleship, weighing tens of thousands of tons, freely in the ocean. The precise machinery in the turret is aimed at aiming at the enemy ship and bombarding it.

In addition to all the equipment on the ship, there are also 1,200 officers and soldiers to drive such a large ship. Their common goal is to fire cannons to attack the enemy. They must have up to ten years of training and stay on this floating fortress. The warship is their only home. No matter how narrow the passages on the ship are or how cramped the rooms are, they can manage everything in an orderly manner. A battleship like the "Idaho," with a displacement of 33,400 tons, is like a small city. The officers and soldiers have set up barbershops, ice cream parlors, tailors' shops, and small shops selling souvenirs on the ship. The profits earned by these shops are used to purchase film projectors, radio receivers, and various small gadgets. Therefore, the people in this warship are much better than other ships in the fleet in terms of comfort and luxury.

A captain on such a great battleship—the captain of the "Idaho" is McKenna—is like the general manager of a large company with capital of US$70 million or the mayor of a city with a population of 1,201. In peacetime, he commands all affairs on the ship, and in wartime, he leads his subordinates to fight the enemy desperately. According to naval practice, the captain must be able to live a lonely life, so those who like to be lively find this position difficult to fill. In order to avoid partiality towards people, the captain must carefully consider inviting people to dinner or inviting guests to banquets. On the starboard rear deck of the ship, there is another deck for his personal use. When the warships are lined up in formation, he always stands on the bridge and does not leave easily.

### Our Country's Cotton Textile Industry During Wartime

The original title of this article was "Our Country's Cotton Textile Industry and its Production and Sales Overview During Wartime." It was written by Mr. Nie from the Third Continued Compilation of the China National Economic Research Institute's China and Foreign Economic Yearbook (to be published by the World Bureau). The analysis is insightful, and the materials are invaluable. With the consent of the author and the institute, we are publishing the first two paragraphs of his overview of the industry in this journal so that readers can get a quick preview.

An Overview of the Textile Industry During Wartime

The cotton textile industry is our country's largest industry and also the national industry where the economic war between our country and Japan is the fiercest. Before the war, Chinese-owned mills nationwide had 2.92 million yarn spindles and 25,500 looms; Japanese-owned mills had 2.49 million yarn spindles and 28,900 looms; Central Chinese-owned mills had 230,000 yarn spindles and 4,000 looms; totaling 5.64 million yarn spindles and 58,400 looms. If there were no natural disasters or human misfortunes, and the country were peaceful and prosperous, it would not be impossible to increase yarn spindles by 500,000 and looms by 5,000 annually. Unfortunately, the July 7th Incident led to a national war, and most of the Chinese-owned factories were located in occupied areas, either bombed, damaged, or forcibly seized. Those that were able to survive and remain intact were only the 640,000 yarn spindles and 4,600 looms within the Shanghai International Settlement today, and the fourteen small yarn spindles and small number of looms in "Free China."

After the outbreak of the war, the government strongly ordered factories in coastal provinces to move to the rear and continue production. However, because the event happened suddenly, there was no sufficient preparation, and due to various concerns, they hesitated and watched, failing to take action. Soon after, our country's mill concentration areas such as Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Wuxi, Changzhou, Hankou, and other places fell one after another. Those that truly managed to move to the rear were only 100,000 yarn spindles and several hundred looms. Thinking of this, one cannot help but feel disheartened.

The following table shows the Chinese-owned textile mills in occupied areas that were either damaged or seized: (Unit: 1 Spindle/1 Loom)

Although Japanese-owned textile mills in China suffered damage due to the war, with 820,000 yarn spindles and 15,000 looms affected, comparing the figures with the table on the left makes their dominant position all too clear.

Comparison Table of Yarn Spindles and Looms in China Before and After the War (All based on an article in the Research Institute's Statistical Monthly. Three points should be noted: (1) The number of yarn spindles and looms before the war refers to the sum of those in operation and those planned to be added; (2) The "after-war" figures refer to the situation in May of the Republic of China Year 28; the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of spindles and looms actually in operation; (3) The "after-war" Japanese mills include the seized Chinese mills under so-called "military management" and "entrusted operation," revealing their intention to monopolize the industry.

Expressing the previous table in percentages yields the following table:

Textile Mills in Shanghai

According to figures released by the Shanghai Japanese Textile Association's survey in mid-May last year, there were thirty-two factories in occupied areas that were seized, managed, and operating; twenty-two factories in Central China, with 483,741 yarn spindles operating (accounting for 81% of the original number of spindles) and 3,722 looms operating (accounting for 65% of the original number of looms). In short, the repair of damaged machinery requires considerable expense, the supply of raw cotton is not smooth (especially in North China), and sales are becoming increasingly obstructed, thus preventing Japanese businesses from fully utilizing the Chinese factories they have taken over for production.

According to a Japanese survey from the year before last May, 500,000 yarn spindles and 3,000 looms in Chinese factories in the Shanghai-Nanjing area were destroyed by artillery fire during the August 13th Shanghai Incident. Although the Chinese factories that moved into the concessions afterwards have increased and expanded, they are still far from their pre-war state. According to the Japanese, the number of yarn spindles and looms in operation in Central China is only 70% of the pre-war level, and in North China, only 75% of the pre-war level. Therefore, production has also decreased sharply. Central China produces 120,000 bales of cotton yarn per month (with Japanese factories accounting for more than half), while North China produces only 40,000 bales per month (almost entirely produced by Japanese factories). These products are mostly sold locally or in nearby areas, with the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Tianjin-Pukou lines, and the Yangtze River basin being the most prominent.

Economic Journal, Issue 366

The rear lacks textile production facilities, and the supply of yarn and cloth has always been unable to meet demand. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has relocated inland, and the demand for clothing and bedding for the military and civilians has become even greater. Relying on the 340,000 yarn spindles and small number of looms in the interior, the strained situation is obvious. In recent years, the government has promoted handicrafts and the textile industry, encouraging increased production of local yarn and cloth. After careful research by technicians, improved hand-spinning machines have been developed and promoted. However, the output is still far from meeting the demand. Therefore, the supply of yarn and cloth to the rear must still rely on Shanghai or foreign countries. The surviving Chinese-owned mills and British-owned mills in Shanghai have become big tycoons, making a fortune from the national crisis, with profits that are unimaginable to ordinary people.

The operation of textile mills in Shanghai is listed in the following table (Unit: Spindles/Looms)

Mill Name Current Number of Yarn Spindles Operating Current Number of Looms Operating

A. Chinese Mills Self-Operated and with Foreign Connections

This autumn of national life-and-death survival has created a golden opportunity for manufacturers. Compared with the profits during the European War more than 20 years ago, the difference is immeasurable. In the past, a profit of two or three million yuan was already difficult to achieve, but now, ten or twenty million yuan is considered normal. Thinking of this, one cannot help but be shocked. The distribution of profits by Chinese factories has never been publicly reported. However, it is said that factories with tens of thousands of yarn spindles are making profits of more than one million yuan. It can be generally seen that the more yarn spindles, the greater the profits. Here are three examples from newspapers for reference.

A. Shanghai Textile Mill (Japanese-owned)

The mill's capital is 12 million yuan, with 152,260 yarn spindles and 2,588 looms in operation. The total profit for the 1940 fiscal year was 22,187,775.63 yuan, approximately 185% of the capital. The calculations for the first and second halves of the year are as follows:

B. Tongyi Textile Mill (Chinese-owned with British connections)

The mill's original capital was 1.7 million yuan, which was repeatedly increased by issuing dividends as stock to 2.97 million yuan. It has 57,808 yarn spindles and 300 looms in operation. The profit comparison for the past three years is as follows: (The settlement period is December 31st each year)

Last year's profit was three times its capital, which is truly astonishing. What is even more noteworthy is that the profits of various Shanghai factories last year were mostly the highest in their history. The four words "unprecedented and unrepeatable" can be well applied to them.

Commercial News

### Yarn and Cotton: American Cotton Active and Firm

New York Cable: The American cotton market is active and firm, rising due to purchases by the industry and Wall Street stock traders. Closing results were three to six points higher than the previous day.

Also, the statistics for American cotton from August 1st of last year to April 11th of this year are recorded on the left (per 500-pound bale).

The Bombay Indian cotton market is closed. Black market prices have risen across the board, with Bengal increasing by 4 rupees and 25, and Yamla and Balochistan each increasing by 6 rupees.

### Sugar Market: Futures Crude White Retreats

Yesterday, the sugar market's futures crude white slightly declined due to profit-taking sales by囤积户 (speculators). Spot goods are poorer, while refined white is stable. The guild's盘 (market assessment) for spot goods is 24 crude white at 90 yuan to 89 yuan and 8 jiao. The April 20th futures initially traded at 90 yuan 3 jiao 1 fen to 90 yuan, then fell from 89 yuan 8 jiao to 4 jiao, 3 jiao, 2 jiao, dropping about 1 yuan. The end-of-April futures initially traded at 91 yuan 1 jiao, 1 jiao 5 fen, to 91 yuan, then weakened to 90 yuan 9 jiao, 8 jiao, 6 jiao, 3 jiao, until 90 yuan. The牧盘 (closing assessment) rebounded slightly to 90 yuan and 2 jiao, down 1 yuan. Taikoo car (refined) B mark is still 92 yuan at Xizhan (West Wharf), and DY mark is 85 yuan and 5 jiao.

### North-South Freight: Longan Market Freight Still Strong

Longan is one of the common tonics and is quite popular. Last year, due to a blockade of the seaport by a certain party, there was a shortage for a long time. Later, someone tried various methods to ship them to Xiamen by boat, and then transfer them to Shanghai, resulting in the highest price. Afterwards, boat transportation resumed, and arrivals gradually increased. This spring, because going to [去化至呆] exhausted, the opening price was less than half of the peak price. However, vendors in this city all seek high profits and are mostly unwilling to lower prices with the opening price, which is regrettable. Later, boat transportation from Xinghua and Quanzhou was blocked again, and the market price originally had the possibility of turning prosperous. However, the state of oversupply still exists, so the production price and the Shanghai market have not been able to escape the divergent phenomenon.

### Vermicelli Suddenly Takes Off

Vermicelli suddenly took off and rose sharply because the production price was expensive and arrivals and inventories were both scarce, increasing by thirty to forty yuan before and after. Yesterday, Longkou vermicelli was sold for 260 yuan, Qingdao vermicelli for 220 yuan, and Jiangbei vermicelli for 170 yuan, which is an unprecedented high price. Moreover, this item is made from steamed beans and is related to miscellaneous grains.

### Peach Meat Gradually Goes Downstream

Peach meat is gradually going downstream because sales in Yishui have turned dull, and as the weather is getting hotter, there is a risk of spoilage. Yesterday's market price for Tianjin peach meat was 170 yuan, and Jinan peach meat was 165 yuan, about 10 yuan lower than before.

### Medicinal Materials: Lily Bulbs Have Been Lacking for a Long Time

Lily bulbs have been lacking in supply for a long time, and the market has already opened up for customers and goods. The inventory in the market is also thin, and it will soon be out of stock. Therefore, the market price continues to rise. Since the beginning of last month, it has increased by about three points (三分之 [缺]) before and after. The current market price is actually 150 yuan to 160 yuan. It is still a long time before the new season, and there is a possibility of continued tightness in the future market.

### Hardware: Black Steel Billets Have No Reduction in Actual Sales

The trend of black steel billets has been rising for a long time. Because general manufacturers are unable to purchase high-grade raw materials (such as tinplate and [會司鐵] galvanized iron) due to their high prices, they are using the lower-grade raw material of black steel billets within the possible range. This product is quite popular with machine factories, mirror factories, and thermos bottle factories and can factories in this street. Therefore, daily transactions can be considered not deserted. However, there is currently no source overseas, and the inventory in this city is ultimately limited. People in the industry have a very strong mindset and are unwilling to let go easily. Yesterday, the market quoted a price of 3,200 yuan per 2,000-pound bundle. Although the market price has not increased much compared to the previous market, the black market is gradually tightening.

### American Narrow Strip Steel Rises

American narrow strip steel is the next grade of [會司鐵] galvanized iron. The amount of demand from manufacturers is only next to black steel billets, because its standard is also considered low. Currently, due to the soaring prices of tinplate and [會司鐵] galvanized iron, (the current market price of tinplate is 500 yuan per box, [會司鐵] galvanized iron from old steel factories is close to 400 yuan, and [會司鐵] galvanized iron from new steel factories is also close to 390 yuan), the purchase of this product by toy factories, cigarette factories, and printing factories is urgent. Moreover, there are not many circulating goods, and those who hold the goods have a strong heart, with the offering price rising step by step. Yesterday, every 200 pounds was sold for 320 yuan, an increase of up to 10 yuan compared to the previous price.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarettes Are Weak in Both Supply and Demand

After black market cigarettes were囤积堆存上栈 (accumulated, piled up, and stored on the upper deck) by speculators inside and outside the industry, there was already a sense of [满谷满坑] (being completely full). It is cursed that actual sales are gradually narrowing because of the "搬吊证" (transport certificate) problem in other ports, which cannot transport inland, resulting in scattered minds and weak supply and demand. The market atmosphere is stable. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: Great Britain brand 1,199 yuan, Old Knife brand 928 yuan, a small decrease of five or six yuan compared to the previous time; Pin Hai brand 873 yuan, Little Fairy brand 666 yuan, Five Flowers brand 673 yuan, Great Beauty medium box 700 yuan, Golden Mouse brand medium box 460 yuan, Little Beauty medium box 458 yuan, lacking inquiries. Only the prices of high-quality cigarettes are quite tight, such as the ten-cigarette Great Front Gate brand at 410 yuan per 10,000 cigarettes, the fifty-cigarette Great Front Gate brand at 1,368 yuan per 10,000, and the ten-cigarette Great South Gate brand at 1,005 yuan per 10,000, lacking sellers.

What I Saw, Heard, and Thought

The fact that cash needs to be discounted against clearinghouse checks is an "unethical" phenomenon in the currency industry that harms the national currency.

It is said that "this is the result of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications ceasing to supply clearinghouse checks." However, the cessation of the three banks' supply of clearinghouse checks does not affect the total supply of clearinghouse checks, which is actually determined by commercial banks.

It is also heard that "banks often use 'only redeem cash' as a reason for rejecting checks." The currency industry's reserve bank also uses the method of deducting interest to reduce the balance of interbank reserves. Therefore, the supply of cash exceeds demand, and clearinghouse checks have become a rare commodity." If this is the case, then what is the meaning of the orders to "encourage people to save" and "increase bank deposit interest"?

If this kind of "unethical" phenomenon is allowed to exist, then the foreseeable consequences are nothing other than: (1) Creating opportunities for general silver shops and money changers to absorb cash and open up sources of funds. They can "start a business without capital" in the operation of check business and expand their speculation possibilities. (2) Creating an era of flooding clearinghouse checks from silver shops and money changers, because to avoid the loss of cash discounts, everyone will flock to Sichuan Road to open checking accounts.

If it is believed that the restriction of speculation in US dollars is due to the cessation of US dollar checking accounts by American banks in this city, and that Chinese bankers can also curb speculation by shrinking check business, this is truly the greatest fallacy.

To eliminate this "unethical" phenomenon, the matter is extremely simple: (1) Increase the deposit interest rate for the currency industry while lowering the current account interest rate. (2) Do not use "only redeem cash" as a reason for rejecting checks. (3) The reserve bank for the currency industry should immediately release the balance of interest-bearing interbank deposits within the limit.

To ensure that "raising deposit interest rates" does not become empty talk, it is better for the state to bear the increased burden on the currency industry due to the interest rate increase. The interest on the deposit balance of the currency industry reserve bank can also be handled in the same way. However, under the interest rate guarantee system, an audit condition should be attached to prevent abuses.

Using "only redeem cash" as a reason for rejecting checks is a means for bank staff to extend their "vacations." It is easy for the authorities of each bank to rectify.

Lowering the current account interest rate can reduce the activity of speculators using checks. It is heard that the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications have now fully accepted cash, so the cash discount has already been lowered. This has already had an "unexpected effect" on the currency contraction policy.

### Taxpayers' Special Meeting Scheduled to Be Held; Bureau Makes Careful Arrangements; Strict Security Inside and Outside the Venue; Everything Changes After the Change of the Board of Directors

The special meeting and annual meeting of foreign taxpayers has been decided to be held successively at the public grandstand of the Race Club on Jing'an Temple Road on April 17th (Thursday) starting at 2:30 PM. In recent days, the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau has been actively arranging the venue and erecting reed mat sheds to ensure that it can be held on time regardless of wind or rain. The arrangements may still be the same as the situation of the reopened special meeting of foreign taxpayers (February 5th of this year). The podium and the taxpayers' seats are completely separated to prevent accidents. At the same time, for the sake of safety, the police department will send a large number of international detectives and police officers to be on special guard inside the venue during the meeting. The entrance to the venue will be particularly heavily guarded. Except for foreign taxpayers holding election tickets and news reporters with special passes, no one will be allowed to enter without special permission. It is believed that the holding of this special meeting of taxpayers and the annual meeting is completely different in nature from the special meeting of taxpayers on January 23rd of this year, so no unexpected events will occur.

Unanimous Attention to the Issue of Chinese Directors

Among the special circumstances of this year's election of directors of the Public Works Bureau, the issue that the Chinese side is paying full attention to is the issue of Chinese directors. The five current Chinese directors, Chu Qiaqing, Yuan Lüdeng, Chen [陈缺] Rui, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun, the six Chinese committee members Liu Shifang, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guangqun, Jin Tongyin, Zhao Fuding, and Li Wenjie, and the real estate committee member Jin Zongcheng, etc.,

have long been nominated by the current Chinese taxpayers' association for reelection and have been officially recognized by the Public Works Bureau. However, according to the new ratio, the number of Chinese directors has suddenly been reduced to four. Although all parties attach importance to this change, the current Chinese directors, committee members, etc., all strictly adhere to silence and do not say a word. The reporter yesterday telegraphed Yuan Yandeng and Xi Yushu, who are still staying in Shanghai, but both refused to express any opinions on this issue.

Foreign Nationals Reach a Compromise

Dr. Arles, a foreign Sinologist, published a commentary in the English-language Greater Shanghai Weekly yesterday, stating that the taxpayers of the International Settlement will hold a meeting next Thursday (the 17th). At that time, the compromise reached between the British, American, Japanese, German, Dutch, and Swedish expatriates may be voted on. That is, the current board of directors of the Public Works Bureau will be replaced by a temporary board of directors of sixteen members (including four Chinese directors). If this compromise is approved, it seems that citizens of any nationality will not nominate additional candidates other than the candidates who have already been put forward. Therefore, regardless of whether the election is held or not, these sixteen "temporary directors of the Public Works Bureau" are almost certain to become the directors of the new Public Works Bureau. There is an ancient saying in the East, the general idea of which is "it is difficult to turn back a runaway carriage."

Temporary Measures Are Likely to Become Permanent

The Japanese believe that the temporary board of directors is only a temporary organization, but the board of directors of the Public Works Bureau cannot return to its normal state until the current situation ends. As time goes on, these temporary measures may become permanent. At the same time, the Public Works Bureau, which has traditionally been dominated by British and American directors, may find it difficult to restore its old state. Once the inside story of the negotiations that created this "temporary board of directors" is revealed, the public will be able to realize that the purpose of the negotiations was to delay the current situation as much as possible. Although the allocation of directors to various countries by the "temporary board of directors" cannot be said to reach the ideal standard, it can also be regarded as being unable to achieve the top choice and only seeking the next best. If it were not for the insistence of the American expatriates at the time, the organization of the board of directors would have been even worse. We have no objection to the candidates for the "temporary board of directors," because they are all people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time and are persons of status. There is nothing inappropriate about their positions as directors of the Public Works Bureau.

Hope to Pay Attention to the Interests of the Masses

Among the sixteen candidates for director of the Public Works Bureau, fourteen are large businessmen. Although lawyer Ahleman is not a businessman, he is quite close to the business community. Only one person, Mingside, has no relationship with the business community. Mr. Ming is an educator and clergyman who was nominated as a candidate for director of the Public Works Bureau. Mr. Ming's inclusion in the director group as a non-businessman is also a glory for the American expatriates. We hope that the future board of directors will not become another group of tai-pans (大班, foreign managers) in history. We hope that the new board of directors will not focus solely on big business and neglect the interests of small businessmen. Shanghai is currently encountering extremely serious labor problems. It would be most unfortunate if the business community abuses the new board of directors as it has done in the past.

### Secretly Investigate the Addresses of Rice Hoarding Warehouses; It Is Decided to Order Them to Sell

Unlicensed Merchants Hoarding Rice Will Be Investigated and Punished; A Large Number of Foreign Rice Transactions Were Made During the Holidays

Since the authorities of the two concessions have actively taken measures to stabilize the rice market, they have gradually seen results. However, speculation in general is still active, so the entire rice industry market is sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and it is difficult for the prices of domestic and foreign rice to fall. Ordinary people and salaried employees are inevitably facing serious threats. In order to quickly seek to relieve the people's hardship and ensure social security, the two authorities are now investigating the real names of rice hoarders and the amount they are hoarding, taking both long-term and short-term measures. Once the investigation is completed, each of the rice hoarders will be ordered to voluntarily release the hoarded goods into the market, otherwise they will be treated as hoarding and speculated, and they will be investigated and dealt with according to law, in order to stabilize people's food supply.

Hope for Exposure

According to another source, in order to thoroughly understand the amount of rice hoarding, the two authorities have not only sent personnel to secretly investigate in separate groups, but they are also afraid that the listening and seeing are not comprehensive and cannot be fully exhausted. Therefore, they still hope that residents of the entire city will report and expose to the two authorities, 分 [缺] the real names of rice hoarders, 分 [缺] the amount of rice hoarded, and 分 [缺] the exact address of the rice warehouses. After receiving the relevant report letter, the authorities will send personnel to secretly investigate the address. If it is found that it is true, it will be registered for future reference. As for rice merchants using trucks to transport domestic and foreign rice, they must report to the relevant authorities in advance or obtain a transport permit. When encountering police detectives checking on the road, they must show the relevant transport permit. Its 分 [缺] is to prevent the smuggling of rice.

Punish Hoarders

The reporter also obtained definite information that the two authorities, in view of the lack of spot chips in the rice market, are due to the fact that large amounts of foreign rice 分 [缺] are not being released from the warehouses. If they are not urgently banned, the future of the rice market will be even more unthinkable. However, unlicensed speculative merchants with ample funds are also to blame for the manipulation of rice. Now the authorities have made a determination and are actively planning measures to punish foreign merchants hoarding rice. Anyone who is outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant and dares to conceal the truth will be severely punished once they are discovered. It is hoped that unlicensed merchants will quickly sell off the hoarded rice and not continue to be stubborn.

Source of Foreign Rice

Report [报] Zhan [战] The Thai government will implement unified food rice management, stipulating that all rice exports must be licensed by the Thai government before they can be shipped. However, more than 60% of the rice in this city comes from Vietnam. Rice shipped to Shanghai from Thailand accounted for only 25.7% of the total imports last year. As of February of this year, the total import of foreign rice was 470,000 bags, while Thai rice accounted for only more than 20,000 bags. Therefore, the total amount of Thai rice shipped to Shanghai has dropped to 2%. The Thai government's implementation of unified management of rice exports has little impact on the Ministry's rice market. The Thai government is only managing rice exports, not prohibiting them, so rice merchants in this city can still order Thai rice as usual.

Arrivals Last Week

Yesterday, it was announced by the rice industry that due to the relaxation of foreign exchange last week and the decline in the production price of foreign rice, general legitimate rice merchants, for the sake of contingency planning, entrusted various foreign firms to telegraph overseas rice-producing areas to order large amounts of foreign rice. The rice is now being loaded onto hired ships and will soon arrive here. However, the large amount of Saigon and Yangon foreign rice transacted in the middle of last month has now been successively shipped to Shanghai. It is reported that a total of more than 100,000 bags of foreign rice arrived last week. In addition to being provided to citizens for daily purchase 分 [缺], there are still 30,000 to 40,000 bags stored in warehouses. Therefore, in the midst of this abundant source, the price of rice is still rising step by step, which is very strange. If there are no rice worms at work, why is this the case?

Market Reopens Today

Regarding the future of the people's food supply in this city, since the authorities of the two concessions have taken strict measures to stabilize it, the general public has been quite pleased to hear about it. However, under the control of speculation, it is difficult to predict the future of the people's food supply. Also, since the rice market has been closed for two days from the 11th of this month for the Tomb Sweeping Festival as usual, the number of foreign rice that arrived and was transacted in these three days is considerable. Therefore, after the rice market reopens today, it is expected that spot goods will increase.

### Hangzhou Bay Midnight Crossing: Detailed Account of a Sailing Boat Accident: Over One Hundred and Forty Passengers Drowned; Families Grieved and Desperately Searched for Bodies

Since the Japanese expanded their blockade of maritime traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang, travelers between Shanghai and Zhejiang have often risked crossing Hangzhou Bay. The waterway is over three hundred li in distance, with normally rapid currents and high tides. The only means of crossing are old-fashioned small sailing boats with wind canopies, which speed along relying on the wind, creating dangerous situations. On the morning of the ninth of this month, an unprecedented tragedy occurred. A boat capsized, drowning a total of over one hundred and forty passengers of Ningbo origin and other origins. Only forty or so survived. The accident site was in Fengxian County, which borders suburban Shanghai, at a place called Jinshanwei. It is a half-hour car ride from Shanghai. Considering the extreme seriousness of the matter, I went to the accident site to investigate and personally witnessed the desolate and tragic scene of bodies strewn along the riverbank. The details are recorded below:

A Small Boat Crosses Over Three Hundred Li

The start and end points of the Hangzhou Bay crossing are Andong Town in Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, and Caojing Town (i.e., Zhangjiaku, also divided into North and South Ku) in Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province. The crossing traverses Hangzhou Bay, a distance of over three hundred li, with very rapid winds and waves. The means of crossing is a type of sailing boat with a wind canopy, commonly called a "Ba Boat." It relies entirely on wind power. With favorable winds and rapid tides, the journey of over three hundred li can be completed in just three or four hours. If the wind is unfavorable or if the boat runs aground during low tide, there are often long delays. Since the maritime traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang was blocked, this place has become a place for travelers to risk returning and forth.

Strong Winds, Rapid Tides, Accident in the Dark

The captain of the Ba boat that capsized at Jinshanwei on the morning of the ninth was about forty years old and from Andong. He had three crew members. The boat had a single mast and canopy, so the hull was not very large. It departed from Andong at 10:00 p.m. on the eighth of this month, carrying over two hundred passengers. The boat was extremely crowded. That night, the south wind was very strong, and the boat was traveling very fast. The boat's final destination was the waters off Jinshanwei, only nine li from Zhangjiaku (where the Japanese troops landed on August 13). At that time, the wind was strong, and the tide was rapid, and the boat was overloaded. The captain and crew realized that the crisis was imminent. Therefore, they did not reach Zhangjiaku and crashed the boat onto the mudflats along the coast of Jinshanwei, hoping to run it aground to alleviate the crisis.

Unprecedented Tragedy Occurs in an Instant

However, the mudflats along the coast of Jinshanwei are very wide. The place where the boat was stopped was two or three li from the shore. The seawater there was waist-deep. At that time, the captain knew that the hull was about to burst. He shouted loudly, ordering the passengers to leave the boat and go ashore. However, it was nighttime. Which way was the shore? Which way was the sea? How could the passengers distinguish in a panic? Even if they stepped towards the beach, the water was still waist-deep. Unless they had some swimming skills, it was difficult to stand and move. Thus, an unprecedented tragedy unfolded. In this event, only forty or so people stepped onto the mudflats and landed ashore alive. Ninety or so drowned on the beach. Forty or fifty bodies that fell into the sea have not yet been recovered.

Most of the Bodies Retrieved are Naked

After the accident, there was an uproar. The residents there were awakened in shock. After learning the reason and guiding the surviving passengers to safety, it was already dawn before they began to retrieve the bodies. However, the local residents had limited knowledge. When they saw that the bodies were wearing gorgeous clothes and had money hidden on them, they were stripped and their pockets were cut open. Therefore, most of the bodies retrieved were naked or incompletely clothed. As of yesterday, about one hundred bodies had been recovered. These bodies were arranged and placed in the pits in an orderly manner, and covered with reed mats for families to identify.

Families Seek Bodies Amidst Cries

After receiving the news, the Datong News Agency reporter drove to Minhang yesterday morning, passing through Xidu, Xiaotang, Nanqiao, Xinxishi, Zhaolin, Caojing, and arrived at Jinshanwei in half a day. He visited Li Ximing and others on the spot and personally inspected the place where the bodies were laid out. Most of these bodies were from Ningbo (accounting for six or seven out of ten), Shaoxing, and other places (accounting for three or four out of ten) who came to Shanghai. Families in Shanghai came to identify them in an endless stream, and cries of grief were incessant. About four out of ten were identified and buried locally. The wife of Zhang Linbao, a Ningbo native living at No. 53, Wufuli, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, was also identifying bodies. Her mother, Li (52 years old), son, Huaqiang (5 years old), and Li Pinghe’s wife (28 years old) and child (3 years old) and Li Guifang's mother (53 years old), Li Jinfu (66 years old), two grandchildren (one 8 years old and one 6 years old), Li Laifa's wife (23 years old), son (4 years old), younger brother (6 years old), Li Sanren (a woman in her fifties), Zhou Ada (a woman in her fifties), entrusted Li Yunqing, a fellow tradesman who was a boatman, to bring them to Shanghai. They also came to Shanghai from Andong on this boat. Except for Li Yunqing, who escaped, all the others died. After Li Yunqing notified the family in Shanghai, they went to Jinshanwei to look for bodies. Only the body of Huaqiang was found. The other bodies were nowhere to be found.

Where Responsibility Lies; Should be Strictly Investigated

According to Li Yunqing, who escaped, before the boat departed from Andong, he was delayed at the Yadong Inn in Andong. Zhang, the owner of the inn, introduced him to Zhong, an escort at Dalumen, to purchase boat tickets. Each ticket cost fifteen yuan. Most of the other passengers were also escorted to the sailing boat. At that time, Li said to Zhong, the escort, that there were too many people and the sailing boat might not be able to accommodate them. Zhong replied that there were two sailing boats to carry them separately. When they arrived at the boarding place, there was only one sailing boat. It is suspected that the escort and the captain colluded with each other. After the sailing boat had an accident, it immediately split up and disappeared without a trace.

### Mr. Yu Qiaqing Flies to Chongqing

After leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong on the seventeenth of last month, Mr. Yu Qiaqing stayed in Hong Kong for a short time. He flew to Chongqing on the morning of the twelfth on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. He will meet with the highest authorities and report to the central government on the work of providing relief to refugees in Shanghai over the past three years, as well as the current situation in Shanghai. After staying for a few days, he will go to various places in the rear to inspect the construction situation. When Mr. Yu arrived in Hong Kong, due to his advanced age, he originally planned to take a ship from Hong Kong to Yangon, Burma, and then travel via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Later, after a doctor's diagnosis, he changed to taking a plane. After arriving in Chongqing, he will rest temporarily at his residence due to the fatigue of the journey.

### Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign Scheduled to Open the Day After Tomorrow

The second Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign Congress is scheduled to open the day after tomorrow (the 16th). Yesterday, the person in charge of the association hosted doctors and hospitals participating in free X-ray examinations, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xiaochu, Ding Fubao, Wang Wanbai, Zhu Yanggao, Li Baosen, and more than fifty others, to exchange opinions in detail. In addition to asking doctors from major hospitals to perform free X-ray examinations, the association has also compiled and printed an anti-tuberculosis album for distribution to all sectors of society. Anti-tuberculosis propaganda films will be shown in cinemas to broaden publicity. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on the 16th at the Xin Xin Radio Station. Leaders from all walks of life and famous doctors will be invited to give lectures on the latest anti-tuberculosis knowledge to arouse public attention.

### Yesterday was Easter; Prayers Held in Rotation All Day

Yesterday was Easter. Clergy and British and American expatriates throughout Shanghai held commemorative ceremonies at the Union Church on Jiujiang Road, Shanghai American School, the Fourth Regiment of the United States Marine Corps Chapel, the Community Church on Jing'an Temple Road, and the Foreign YMCA. It is said that Jesus resurrected on Sunday, so he taught his disciples to pray for it. Therefore, yesterday, various churches in Shanghai held prayer ceremonies in rotation all day, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

### Labor Unrest in Water and Wood Industries Not Yet Resolved: Over Ten Thousand Strikers; Over Ten Workers Arrested and Released Yesterday; Resolving the Labor Unrest of Ningbo Moving Company Automobile Workers

Due to the difficulty of life in recent years, factory labor in the water and wood industries had increased wages twice last year. This year, due to the resurgence of prices, after discussions with worker representatives, the Mountain and Water Wood Industry Vocational Union, and after the factory opened an industry meeting, it was decided to increase wages again: nine corners for woodworking, for a total of one yuan and nine corners including the previous amount; eight corners for plumbing, for a total of one yuan and seven and a half corners including the previous amount (a 90% increase); food will also be provided. The Civil Engineering Contractors Association published an advertisement in the newspaper, announcing that the increase would be implemented uniformly from the 16th of this month. Unexpectedly, the workers did not fully understand, and there were still strike actions. Various construction companies reported to the industry association one after another. The association believed that the wage increase issue had already been resolved by the Water and Wood Industry Vocational Union earlier, and the vocational union should be responsible for resolving the dispute and putting an end to it.

Total Shutdown of Water and Wood Workers

After the water and wood workers went on strike the day before yesterday, the number of people participating in the strike originally reached more than six thousand, but some workplaces and workers had not stopped work, which caused dissatisfaction among the striking workers. Yesterday morning, they went to various workplaces in the public and French concessions to demand participation in the strike, and disputes occurred for a time, causing more than ten striking workers to be arrested by the French Concession police. They were released at around 11:00 a.m. yesterday. As a result, all areas in the second and third districts (i.e., the public and French concessions) also joined the strike yesterday. To date, there have been more than ten thousand strikers in total. It is also understood that the industry's labor and management were originally scheduled to discuss solutions yesterday morning, but were unsuccessful.

Attitude of the Moving Company's Capital

More than one thousand drivers and workers from Mao Tai, China, Taiping, Ningbo, Yong'an, Shangtian, and other moving companies went on strike on the sixth of this month due to unsuccessful requests for wage increases. The capital has not made any clear statements to date, resulting in a deadlocked dispute. It is now understood that the drivers' union, represented by Sun Lianshan, Liu Yongfu, Xu Xiangcheng, and others, and the chairman of the Capital Freight Industry Association, Lou Yinchuan, negotiated several times, and resolved the Ningbo Moving Company's automobile worker strike at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. The main conditions accepted by the capital are as follows:

*   An increase of 30 yuan in rice subsidies per month.
*   Wages will be paid for the duration of the strike.
    The capital has also accepted the other details proposed by the workers. Therefore, the company may resume work within the next few days. The capital of other companies is still considering the terms of the agreement, so it is difficult to resolve the matter for the time being.

Mediation of Commercial Disputes Comes to a Standstill

All employees of the Commercial Press were forced to request a discretionary salary increase from General Manager Wang Yunwu in order to maintain their livelihoods. However, the request was not approved, so all employees were quite indignant. On the 12th, they sent a telegram to General Manager Wang at noon, setting a five-day deadline for a response. The original text of the telegram is as follows: "At 5:30 on the 11th, a membership meeting was convened. The crowd was impassioned and authorized the executive committee to request the general manager to promulgate measures based on the principle of the original minimum wage rate from April within five days; otherwise, all employees will swear to fight to the death. Yun Gong instructed us to persuade our colleagues at night, but I object. The petition is completely factual. Colleagues' lives are in dire straits, like refugees. This is the company's shame. Rice subsidies are too narrow, and there are no subsidies for everything else. Yun Gong knows this clearly, but deceives his conscience. Colleagues are suffering, and the company is prosperous. Zhao Liang."

The Great East Tobacco Factory Has Not Yet Resumed Work

Six hundred female workers at the Hede No. 87 factory went on strike at 8:00 a.m. on the morning due to unsuccessful requests for wage increases. According to a reporter from Daguan News Agency, after learning about the labor unrest, the Public Concession authorities sent personnel to mediate between labor and capital yesterday afternoon. However, due to the wide divergence of opinions, the problem could not be solved. In order to resolve the labor unrest as soon as possible, the Public Concession authorities will conduct mediation again this afternoon.

### Hand Grenade Found on Rue Massenet

A small hand grenade was suddenly found at the foot of a bamboo fence at No. 23, Lane 833, section of Rue Massenet, at 9:30 a.m. yesterday. It was spotted that the safety pin on the grenade had been pulled out, and there was a danger of explosion at the touch of a button. The police reported to the French Concession police station in Loujiawan, which dispatched officers to rush to the scene to remove the explosive power of the grenade, and then moved it into a box of yellow sand to take it back to the police station for destruction. Meanwhile, detectives were sent to investigate its origin and its intended target.

### Smith, General Secretary of the Naval YMCA, to Leave Shanghai

Mr. Smith, the general secretary of the Naval YMCA in Shanghai, who has served for seventeen years, will leave Shanghai on May 3 on the President Pierce to visit his two sons in Iowa, and then go to the Naval YMCA headquarters in New York to take up a new position. Mr. Smith plans to serve in the United States and will not return to Shanghai to continue as general secretary. However, he is likely to return to Shanghai if the headquarters so orders. Mr. Smith came to China seventeen years ago to serve at the Naval YMCA, and his footsteps have taken him all over Beiping, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Chongqing, Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places. He just took up the full-time position of general secretary in October of last year, succeeding Mr. Mai's vacancy in the American Red Cross affairs. Once Mr. Smith goes to the United States, his vacancy will be filled by Mr. Kleiner. In addition, Xiang Sheng will come to Shanghai from the United States in the short term and be ordered to serve at the Naval YMCA. (Written by Wang Rong)

### Rumor that Three French Sailors Deserted to Join the Free French Army; Allegedly Related to the Arrest of High Commissioner

Mr. High Commissioner, a leader of the French community in Shanghai, has been detained on the French gunboat Jary El Ay since he was suddenly arrested by the French naval authorities in Shanghai on the 5th of this month for many days. A reporter from Pingming News Agency learned from well-informed sources in the French community that before High Commissioner was arrested, three French sailors on the French gunboat Jary El Ay, which was berthed in the Huangpu River, suddenly left Shanghai for Hong Kong, and then went to Singapore to join the Free French Army. The French naval authorities believe that the "defection" of the three sailors was assisted by High Commissioner, so they arrested him.

Five People Served

Since General de Gaulle organized the Free French Army in London and continued to cooperate with the British Army to fight against Germany and Italy, French expatriates in Shanghai have been leaving Shanghai one after another to serve in the army. According to reliable information obtained by the French community in Shanghai, five French expatriates in Shanghai recently left Shanghai for Hong Kong to serve in the Free French Army. All five Frenchmen used to serve as police officers in the Shanghai French Concession Police. Two of them were born in Shanghai. This matter happened at the beginning of this month, but they arrived safely in Hong Kong the day before yesterday.

Growing Support

The five French expatriates left Shanghai for Hong Kong to join the Free French Army this time, and the matter was quite tortuous. After deciding to participate in the Free French movement, the five French expatriates first fled from the French Concession to the Public Concession, and obtained a certificate of innocence from the British Consulate in Shanghai before boarding the ship for Hong Kong. They will soon be assisted by the Hong Kong branch of the Free French movement to go to other places to enlist in the army to fulfill their wishes. It is also understood that most of the French expatriates in Shanghai currently support General de Gaulle.

The Leader Returns in a Hurry

In order to promote the Free French movement in various places, the leader of the Free France in the Far East, Pang Long, recently set off to inspect various places. He visited Manila, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, and contacted French expatriates in the Free French movement and the British government authorities in various places. He has now finished his official business and returned to Singapore in a hurry. Pang is extremely concerned about the arrest of High Commissioner, the leader of the Free France in Shanghai.

### A Trip to Nanshi

— Yang Di

Easter, commonly known as Foreign Qingming; the week before is Holy Week, also known as Great Week. The first day is Palm Sunday (or Palm Sunday), which commemorates the story of the people holding green branches, shouting long live, and welcoming Jesus into the holy city of Jerusalem; on this day, the church reads the beginning and end of the Passion written by Matthew. The first day reads the Passion written by Mark; the fourth day reads the Passion written by Luke; the fifth day commemorates Jesus establishing the Holy Body, and the bells are silent for more than two days to express grief. The sixth day reads the Passion written by John. The seventh day is the eve of the Resurrection, also known as the Vigil of the Resurrection. The churches are especially busy during this week. Clergy members often move all over. Dozens of priests and monks from Huicun Church blessed the Holy Oil and participated in the ritual wearing vestments, which lasted for three or four hours. In each church, a new altar is set up in another corner, with the utmost decoration, and the Holy Body is offered day and night. The lights and candles are brilliant, and the people who worship the Holy Body come in an endless stream. The most churchgoers in Shanghai go to Xujiahui on this day; the traffic is busy, and it is a grand occasion.

From the afternoon of the fifth day, I was assigned from Xujiahui to the Dongjiadu Catholic Church in Nanshi to help out for two days. This was my second trip to Nanshi after August 13. The first time was last winter, when I wanted to write an article for the 300th anniversary of the old church, so I went to conduct a field survey. As a result, I was greatly disappointed. The inscriptions and ancient sites were all gone. Therefore, the article was not written. Father Fan of the church wanted to publish a commemorative album, but it did not come to fruition due to various reasons. I remember that it was a day of drizzling rain, and my classmate Qian and I walked in the broken walls and ruins, which was even more desolate!

The first time was between February and March this year, when I went to the Holy Sepulchre Church for a funeral. The Holy Sepulchre Church buries Chinese and Western Jesuit priests who have died in Shanghai since the Ming and Qing dynasties. Wu Yushan, a famous painter of the Qing Dynasty, and Father Yunxi, a descendant of Xu Wending Gong who died last year, their bodies are all sleeping there.

The Holy Sepulchre Church is near MinGuo Road. Zhengxiu Middle School and Xin Puyu Hall are also there. Zhengxiu Middle School has a glorious history. The National Domestic Goods Exhibition and the Congress of the Catholic Action Association were both held there. I went to listen to several lectures when the Congress of the Catholic Action Association was held. Now it's a mess.

That day, I visited the Xin Puyu Hall by the way, and was entertained by Mother Fan. She expressed her gratitude to the philanthropists who generously donated, especially to Mr. Lu and Mr. Deng, who climbed up and shouted about charity.

I already knew about Mr. Lu's personality. Mr. Lu is from my hometown, and I am very honored by this. Before I went to Nanshi the day before yesterday, I visited his office by the way. Although it was the first time we met, we hit it off at first sight and talked for forty or fifty minutes. I designed some religious questions, and he admired the service spirit of the nuns very much. In addition to thanking him in person, I now sincerely salute Mr. Lu and Mr. Deng and all those who do not shirk responsibility and do what is right. "The benevolent live long" and "doing good is the most glorious"!

The Dongjiadu Catholic Church has a long history and is a place for priests in Jiangnan to escape the summer heat and be quiet. Before the war, it had six or seven thousand very enthusiastic churchgoers. Now, only one-sixth or one-seventh have returned to their homeland.

I stayed at this old Dongjiadu Church for two nights. The almost half-moon was shrouded in a hazy mist, as if it was crying, with a sad face. It was very quiet at night, eerily scary!

Yesterday morning, after the religious ceremony was completed, guided by my classmate Shen, I roamed around the nearby broken walls and ruins. Shen is from Dongjiadu. He pointed to the piles of rubble and broken bricks and said to me: This is the home of a certain classmate, that is the home of a certain classmate; his own home is also included. Several ragged children were excavating on the ruins.

Spending Jesus' Passion Week in such a place, reading the lament of the prophet Jesus, "Touching the present and reminiscing about the past, full of emotion"!

This morning, my classmate Qian and I took a walk along the Huangpu River and MinGuo Road for two hours. The ancients said: "The country is broken, the mountains and rivers remain, and the city is full of spring grass and trees." Although it is early spring, I did not see a trace of greenery when I took a walk; this is because the broken bricks and rubble are piled up too deeply, and the grass and trees cannot even take root! Otherwise, the wutong trees should have been several feet high with weeds and smoke for the past three or four years!

Like the second time I went to Nanshi, I also visited the Xin Puyu Hall today and bought some handicrafts from Nanshi, which are "genuine and inexpensive." Shanghai should be the first to promote it, which is really worth introducing to the public.

Yesterday's Shen Bao reported: "Donations to Xin Puyu Hall are becoming more and more enthusiastic," which is very gratifying. However, in today's world where rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, there is no need to spend a high price on electricity and tap water. It is indeed not easy to maintain the lives of hundreds of orphans. Therefore, donations are "the more, the better." I am also happy to act as their advocate.

I remember that four years ago today, I read Chairman Chiang's "Lessons of Jesus' Passion for Us", which was also the day that several colleagues took the lead in converting to Christianity. The lessons of Jesus' Passion for us are very meaningful; the impression I got from the trip to Nanshi is very profound.

Jesus' resurrection is a symbol of the revival of the Chinese nation. Hallelujah!

### High Commissioner Left Shanghai for Haiphong Yesterday

According to the Shanghai news of the Havas World News Agency, regarding the arrest of High Commissioner, the leader of the Free French in Shanghai, the French official recently issued a message stating that after a detailed examination of High Commissioner's physical condition by a doctor, it was deemed that he was fit to sail. The person in question was escorted to Haiphong on the "Kintia" in accordance with the instructions of the commander of the French fleet in Vietnam and in accordance with the Naval Law promulgated on January 13, 1938. Naval officers and Dr. Dennis, a medical officer, also accompanied him. High Commissioner had met with his wife and his defense attorney, Prime, before his departure.

### Pig Slaughterers Resumed Work Yesterday

After the workers of the Minti Neyin Slaughtering Company (commonly known as the Cattle Slaughtering Company) in the French Concession went on strike a few days ago, the strike has lasted for many days. It is now understood that the labor unrest has been mediated by the Fresh Pork Slaughtering Industry Association and the Fresh Meat Industry Association. After negotiation, it was agreed to increase wages and continue to provide food and lodging as usual. The workers are satisfied and have all resumed work yesterday.

### Yien's Pharmaceutical Factory Distribution Center Opens Today

### Public Welfare Advertising Company Relocates

With its promptness, integrity, and reliability, it has won the recommendation of all sectors of the community. Therefore, its business has gradually developed, so the original address is not enough for office. It is heard that the company will move to No. 267 to 269 Hankou Road on the 15th of this month.

Education News

### Resolutions on Education-Related Matters Passed by the Second National Political Council

(Chongqing News Agency) The Second National Political Council was held in Chongqing recently. The council members who came to Chongqing to attend were extremely enthusiastic. The council held consecutive meetings for ten days, and the results were exceptionally satisfactory. At the Second Meeting of the First Session of the Second National Political Council, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education made a report on education, providing separate explanations of government measures regarding higher education, general education, social education, overseas Chinese education, frontier education, and wartime education. Numerical reports were also made on the increase in funding for various educational programs and the increase in the number of students at all levels of schools. Matters concerning the life security and relief of school faculty and students were also elaborated upon. The government also provided reports on the work of other departments, such as politics, economy, foreign affairs, finance, military affairs, transportation, internal affairs, and society. At the same time, council members also put forward many important proposals based on their observations, which were submitted to the general assembly for discussion and were all passed. The resolutions on education-related matters are recorded below:

1.  Proposal submitted by Council Member Zhang Qiyun and twenty-one others regarding the need to enhance the effectiveness of academic research to meet the needs of national construction. Resolution: Amended and passed, to be sent to the government for prompt implementation.

2.  Proposal submitted by Council Member Su Ludai and twenty-one others regarding the government's attention to legal education. Resolution: It is determined that the development of law is related to the foundation of the country, and legal talents are needed for construction projects. The government should pay close attention to this matter, formulate detailed measures to achieve the objective. The measures in the original proposal are sent to the government for reference. (2) Students who have passed the current college entrance examination should be exempted from the short-term training or the two-year training for judges in the Judicial Yuan.

3.  Proposal submitted by Council Members Wang Yaming, Wu Dao'an, Ma Zongrong, Huang Yuren, and twenty-three others regarding strengthening cultural work to benefit the war effort. Resolution: The principles of this proposal are passed and sent to the government for consideration.

6.  Proposal submitted by Council Member Qian Yonghe and twenty-one others regarding the formulation of a plan for the continuing education of current teachers in national schools and central schools. Resolution: The original proposal is passed and sent to the government for adoption and implementation.

(Further News) During the meeting of the Second National Political Council, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, in addition to giving an oral report on the state of education to the general assembly, also submitted a written report. The report on education was carefully reviewed by the council, and opinions were put forward for adoption. These opinions were solemnly resolved by the general assembly. The original text is excerpted as follows: Looking at the education report as a whole, the educational facilities are still in line with national policies. The relief and placement of staff and students, the relocation of schools in the war zone to the rear, the expansion of the number of science and engineering colleges, and the promotion of national education are all intended to preserve the nation's vitality and revitalize the nation's vitality. We are very gratified. However, the implementation of various measures should be carefully considered, such as: (1) The measures for maintaining normal education in the war zone should have greater flexibility, so as to maintain students' academic progress while promoting national consciousness. (2) Public colleges and universities should be adjusted and enriched, and all departments should seek balanced development, so as to avoid students tending to a few departments, which would have a negative impact on society and the country. Assisting provincial and private schools is also an important task, and the amount of subsidies should be increased. (3) The establishment of normal colleges is very practical, but the number of teachers needed by secondary schools nationwide each year should be estimated, and the content of the schools must be enriched. (4) University faculty should be cultivated domestically, but in the short term, sending students abroad is also necessary. The needs of various disciplines should be considered and students should be sent abroad evenly. The research institutes attached to universities should also be enriched. The educational and cultural undertakings run by various Boxer Indemnity organizations should be adjusted to create a rational and systematic distribution. (5) There are many national middle schools and Sun Yat-sen University classes with excellent results, but there are also those that are not perfect. Because these schools are under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, they should strive for excellence and set an example. (6) Vocational schools should encourage further study. In 1940, there were already incentive measures in place, and this aim should be further promoted. Separate incentive measures should be set to instruct the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to pay attention to this matter. The second part of the National Normal College should also be given attention from time to time. (7) National education is tied to the lifeblood of the nation. Recently, it has been heard that some national schools in various places exist in name only, especially in remote areas. The education administration authorities should pay special attention when sending personnel to inspect them. The funding for national education must also be promptly secured so that national education can be popularized as scheduled, and the treatment of teachers should be improved. (8) The editing of textbooks for universities is an important task, but professors have different strengths and different views. The use of the same textbook may hinder academic progress and should be noted. The compilation of textbooks for primary and secondary schools can cultivate common thinking and standardize students' levels. However, in addition to unified teaching materials, attention should be paid to supplementary teaching materials with local characteristics to adapt to local environments.

### Unexpected Turn in Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Fang Yumin Wins Over Zhang Ying and Takes the Fourth Group Championship

The fourth Jingwu Cup All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship elimination round of the fourth group was held at 7:00 PM at the Jingwu Association's billiard room. Pan Yizhi, the grand prize winner of the China United, was eliminated after losing twice to Fang Yumin. Zhang Ying defeated Yuan Zhongxi and Kong Hanchen without much effort. He then fought against Fang Yumin, and after a fierce battle, Zhang finally defeated Fang Yumin with a score of three to two and advanced to the final. Fang, having initially lost to Zhang Ying, then faced Zhang Hanchen. Kong was unable to sustain his strength and was eliminated by Fang in straight sets. Zhang and Fang then had the opportunity to play each other again, and under the contest, Fang performed very well. His backhand shots were accurate, and he defeated Zhang Ying in straight sets, creating a situation where each had lost once and the scores were equal. The two were then re-contested, and Zhang Ying took the lead with a score of two to one in the final. In the fourth game, when the score was nine to eight, Zhang made three consecutive errors, turning victory into defeat, and the two sides tied at one each. At the beginning of the final game, Zhang Ying suffered from hand cramps due to the fierce battle and applied rosin three times, but his holding hand still did not recover. However, Zhang continued to fight, his spirit was very good, but the balls he chopped had lost their control. Fang got this good opportunity and advanced step by step, taking the lead all the way. As a result, Fang eliminated Zhang Ying with a score of three to two and won the championship, an unexpected turn, which was beyond the expectations of the audience.

### Study Lecture: How to Study Chinese (4)

— Xue Wujing

(B) Understanding has different levels of depth, and writing has different levels of difficulty. However, our only standard is to be practical and not pursue empty fame. Generally, the initial interest of those who study Chinese comes from novels. The magic of novels is indeed great. I remember an article discussing the relationship between novels and government, saying, "The control of novels is like this: one day of fumigation, two days of immersion, three days of piercing, and four days of lifting." Therefore, all those who read novels are delighted, and their writing skills improve day by day. Further reading of other books will naturally be easy and efficient.

(C) Application: A person who eats must be able to digest and nourish the whole body. A person who reads must be able to assimilate and integrate it into the brain. In the imperial examination era, poems and sayings of Confucius were used, creating a chaotic atmosphere, like parrots learning to speak. Of course, it would be eliminated by the times. We live in modern times, and we require an understanding of the sound and meaning of a word, the change of sentence structure of a sentence, and the chapter, reasoning, and different styles of an article. Poems, songs, couplets, and sacrificial texts have different formats. If there are slight errors, imitate them and understand them thoroughly. Then, when you come out into the world, you will not have any concerns about being incompatible.

(3) Types to Read: Liang Rengong wrote a national studies booklist, and Hu Shizhi also opened an account for one person. They are all-encompassing and have everything. Not to mention that middle school students cannot finish reading them, even university Chinese department students have a headache. This is written to装装门面装装门面 (put on a show) and scare the general public. My friend Ruan Lezhen had a special name for criticism, so I will not elaborate here and pick up other people's words. However, I feel that in addition to the above three standards, the types to be read should be based on the degree of students, the size of the age, the order of the times, the priorities, and the distinction between intensive reading and extensive reading. The first- and second-rate famous works of ancient and modern times, the needs of the times, and the expectations of the country should be included as many as possible, and the selections must be strict. Reading in chronological order will naturally not be 等不严等不严,不贪多不贪多,向养成向养成 (not be 等不严等不严, not be greedy, but develop), a habit of being studious and thoughtful, and never letting go of the book. The booklist will be discussed in a separate article, so it is not quoted here.

(4) Points to Pay Attention to When Reading: Zeng Wenzheng discussed his son Jize's book, saying, "The method of reading, reading, writing, and composing, four things cannot be lacking. … The doctor is like a rich family accumulating wealth, and reading is like foreign trade, gaining three times the profit. Reading is like guarding carefully at home, not spending lightly. The doctor is like a military strategist fighting, and reading is like attacking cities and seizing land, opening up territories. Reading is like deep trenches and high walls, able to defend." It can be seen that reading and reading should be divided into two things. However, times are different, and there are things to pay attention to as follows:

(A) Reading: Extensive Reading, Memory, Excerpting, Index Cards

(B) Reading: Dictation, Recitation, Reading Aloud, Chanting

Although the above is outlined and obvious at a glance, in addition to extensive reading, memory, dictation, and recitation, which do not require much consideration, the other four points have to be further elaborated.

### Food Talk

— Lini

Professor Gottfried of the University of Vienna once said that, according to his experience, there are indeed many vegetables and fish that can treat dental diseases; among the vegetables, Chinese cabbage and spinach are the most beneficial to teeth because they are rich in lime.

If the intake is specifically limited to the minimum amount of food needed to sustain life, the weight can be reduced accordingly. A professor at Columbia University invented a machine to test a person's minimum amount of food. After measuring the amount, it is used as the standard for food. If you eat no more or no less, you can lose weight. Female students have tried it and it has been very effective.

Taste is closely related to altitude. According to a report from an expedition team to the Himalayas, when ascending to a height of 19,000 feet, the sense of taste is completely lost. Even eating scallions and chili peppers, one does not feel any taste.

Athletes have always avoided sugar during training, but according to experiments by renowned doctors such as Dr. Gordon of Boston, sugary foods are not only harmless to exercise but also beneficial. Runners who drink sweet sugary tea and eat several bean cakes before a race can double their energy. Blood tests show that the degree of fatigue is not as severe as those who run without eating sugar.

Drinking more salt water can withstand heat, because too much heat evaporates a large amount of salt from the body, and drinking salt water replenishes it. The American Academy of Sciences used this method to instruct miners working in tunnels, and they were able to endure the heat after drinking salt water.

### Making a Schoolbag from Broken Socks

— Yingdai

This publication has published many articles on the recycling of broken socks. However, the use of broken socks to make schoolbags has not been mentioned. Therefore, I would like to talk about the process of making a schoolbag from broken socks, as far as I know.

Currently, most students, especially female students, use schoolbags made of yarn strips, which are mostly made from broken socks. We can cut the worn socks horizontally from the top of the sock to the bottom, forming a long strip. Then, wash and dry them, and dye them in various colors. Then, you can weave them into a schoolbag. They are small and exquisite, and very beautiful. Who would know that they are made from broken socks?

The history of making schoolbags from broken socks is probably less than three years. As far as I know, the practice of using broken socks to weave schoolbags and selling them to various schools was first started by refugee craft centers. From then on, it became popular year by year. Now, some people have even opened factories to specialize in making schoolbags from broken socks.

These factories have roughly three sources for broken socks. (1) People who collect garbage pick them up from trash cans; (2) People who exchange sugar exchange them for sugar; (3) People accumulate broken socks and sell them directly to them. At the current market price, one catty of broken socks can be sold for about five jiao.

After the schoolbag factory collects the broken socks and weaves them into schoolbags, each one can be wholesaled for jiao. Therefore, it costs five or six jiao to buy a schoolbag at a department store or stationery store. The work of cutting socks and weaving is done by female workers. The price of cutting one catty of broken socks is only one jiao, and the wage for weaving a schoolbag is only two fen. However, skilled female workers can earn about one yuan a day.

Schoolbags made from broken machines are not only purchased by students, but also by mothers and sisters who go to the vegetable market, who also like to use this kind of schoolbag to replace vegetable baskets. Because it is not easy for thieves to steal things placed inside. Therefore, schoolbags sell quite well. This emerging industry is just beginning to develop; if you want to run a schoolbag factory, you can start a factory with a capital of three or two thousand yuan. This is a small-capital industry that is easy to develop!

### Methods for Cooking Corn Flour

— He Li San

"Corn," also known as "Zea mays," is called "Pearl Rice" in Jiangnan and "Six Grains" in Zhejiang Province. These are just different names depending on local dialects. Originally, it was a coarse food, mainly eaten by poor families in the countryside as a staple food or used to feed chickens. City dwellers rarely tasted it. Since the price of rice in Shanghai soared above one hundred yuan, corn has risen in popularity and gradually entered the cities, occupying a place among staple foods. According to a recent report in our newspaper's "Economic News," grain merchants have released 700,000 to 800,000 bags of corn, indicating its widespread sales. Subsequently, due to hoarding, the price has risen from thirty-seven cents to over forty cents. However, the cooking methods are likely not well known. Recently, the owner of Sanyou Industrial Society sent me a large bag of Six Grain Flour. After many attempts at cooking, I am now writing down my experience and submitting it to this publication for residents who purchase it to consider. (1) Cooking with porridge: When the porridge is almost ready, add 30-40% of Six Grain Flour, stirring constantly with chopsticks while adding it. Once it boils through, it can be taken off the stove. If you like it sweet, you can add some sugar. It can also be cooked with rice; add it when the rice is almost ready, but 10-20% is enough, don't add too much. (2) Mixing into a paste and eating: First, boil water, then pour in the Six Grain Flour, stirring constantly while adding it to prevent it from clumping. Once it boils, it will turn into a paste. Add sugar to eat. (3) Making into dough pellets: First, boil broth with ingredients in a pot, adding vegetables, dried shrimp, or pickled vegetables. Separately, mix Six Grain Flour with cold water; it should be slightly thick, not too thin. You can also add wheat flour. Then, use chopsticks to pick up the flour and drop it into the pot, forming dough pellets. Cook until done. (4) Pan-frying: Mix the flour with cold water, add sugar, and then put it in a wok with soybean oil. Slowly fry, first stirring with chopsticks, then using a spatula to spread it out into an egg-skin shape. Fry until golden brown. The taste is quite delicious, with a flavor similar to eggs. You can also add wheat flour to the mixture. The above cooking methods are all very simple, and this flour can replenish the middle and benefit the Qi, strengthen the spleen, and satisfy hunger. Now that rice prices are so high, using it to supplement meals is both economical and healthy. Everyone should promote it during this extraordinary period.

### More on Soy Sauce and Stomach Ailments

— Qing Cong

After reading my draft "Soy Sauce and Stomach Ailments," Mr. Bai Ma believes that "there are many differences from my understanding," and thus gives the instruction that "soy sauce can cure stomach ailments." However, after carefully examining his argument, it seems to align with my draft and does not deviate much. He also quotes Mr. Xu Zhuodai's saying "fake soy sauce through soy sauce," explaining that inferior soy sauce is indeed unhygienic, which is consistent with my statement. My draft only stated that soy sauce is made from flavorings discarded after extracting residue and residual liquid, and that chemically produced soy sauce, if improperly prepared, may have excessive hydrochloric acid and lacks neutralization, which can easily cause stomach ailments. It is not to say that all chemically produced soy sauces are harmful. Mr. Zhuodai said that chemical soy sauce, although also refined with hydrochloric acid, uses synthetic hydrochloric acid, which is neutralized with "sodium" and thus has no acidity. This also supports my statement. If the preparation is improper, with excessive hydrochloric acid that has not been neutralized, it can indeed harm health. Mr. Bai Ma's father believed that high-quality soy sauce has nourishing properties and can also treat stomach ailments, diabetes, beriberi, heart disease, etc., while fake soy sauce is unhygienic and harmful. The motivation for my previous article was that soy sauce is an essential daily item for families, and its relationship to nutrition and health is so important. Ordinary people cannot understand its benefits and harms, and they are not aware of the distinction between genuine and fake soy sauce. Therefore, I wrote it to urge those in charge of household affairs to pay attention and know what to choose. I have not studied this topic extensively. The information in the previous article was obtained from Mr. Li Youfang of Hengshun Soy Sauce and Vinegar Factory. The Hengshun main factory is located in Zhenjiang, with a history of over ninety years and a reputation throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. What he said is based on experience. I also consulted the "Common Sense of Home Experiments" written by Mr. Tianxu Wosheng. Mr. Wosheng is dedicated to home industry with outstanding achievements, which cannot be compared with armchair strategists, so his arguments must be credible and well-founded. In conclusion, Mr. Bai Ma's point of view differs from mine in that I believe inferior soy sauce can lead to stomach ailments, while Mr. Bai Ma believes that high-quality soy sauce has nourishing properties and can also treat diseases, while unhygienic soy sauce is fake soy sauce. However, the main point, to make people aware of how to distinguish and be careful in their selection, is the same.

### Calligraphy and Painting in the Residence

— Master of Paper Curtain and Copper Bottle Studio

Calligraphy and painting are sufficient to decorate a residence. In the past, large pieces were valued because they were grand, provided an atmosphere of mist and clouds, and were endlessly fascinating. Even the artist felt free and unrestrained. In the past, Dongjiang Wang Dajue asked my teacher, Mr. Shi Yu, for a painting, but Mr. Shi Yu disliked the small paper and said it was useless. Dajue then presented a poem asking how such a large universe could accommodate a few plum blossoms, which shows that large-scale works were popular at that time. House prices in Shanghai are particularly high, and residences are mostly small, so the style of calligraphy and painting has undergone a significant change, with short pieces of two or three feet being preferred. Mustard seed can hold Mount Sumeru; this is where it can be seen. In Wu Zhong, there were elegant and skilled artists who came to Shanghai as gentlemen of leisure, such as Zhang Xingjie and Zhu Zhuyun. One specialized in flowers, excelling in the styles of Bai Yang and Nan Tian, and the other specialized in landscapes, capturing the essence of Zheng Zhong and Liu Ru. Huang Taixuan and Jiang Yinqiu excelled in calligraphy, with their brushwork described by Emperor Jianwen as both sparse and dense, skillful in both regular and cursive scripts. They were like looking at the watchtower of a city gate or gazing at the stars, not seeking the dispersal of clouds or waiting for the red gates of nobility. Both gentlemen created small works that suited the needs of Shanghai residences. Recently, their works were publicly exhibited on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association. The faces of ancient people and the eyes of modern people are truly captivating and endlessly enjoyable.

Introducing the Huo Sang Detective Cases. "The Huo Sang Detective Cases" written by Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing has long been popular at home and abroad. It has now been newly printed by the World Book Company in pocket-sized editions, including (1) Pearl Necklace, (2) In the Huangpu River, (3) Eighty-Four, (4) Blood Under the Wheels, (5) Cotton-Wrapped Knife, (6) The Terrible Farce, and other six titles. All major bookstores are selling them. We are providing this introduction specifically.

### Sleep

— Bao Fuxing

Sleep is very important. If you sleep eight hours a day, then your sleep is equal to one-third of your entire life. If you cherish your own life, you should equally value your sleep. "Half of life is spent in bed" is a cliché, but it never loses its incisive and insightful nature. Because we sleep every day, we don't realize its extraordinary nature. If you want to taste the sweetness of sleep, it's easy: just don't allow yourself to sleep for three days.

There are many methods of sleep. Generally, we cannot do without two types: going to bed late and waking up late, or going to bed early and waking up early. People who are accustomed to going to bed late and waking up late are not accustomed to going to bed early and waking up early, and vice versa. Someone has proposed a very ingenious method: going to bed late and waking up early. To replenish daytime energy, you can take a nap. In fact, you don't necessarily have to take a nap. Whether it's morning or evening, as long as you have time, you can take a short nap. I think the sleep method above is worth trying, especially for people who like to wake up early and also love the night. (To be continued)

Bamboo shoots are indeed an exquisite ingredient; almost everyone loves to eat them. Even old ladies without teeth have to pick some tender bamboo shoot tips to eat.

We often eat dishes like stir-fried bamboo shoots with shredded pork, braised bamboo shoots with pickled meat, braised bright shrimp with bamboo shoot cubes, bamboo shoots mixed with gluten, and stir-fried bamboo shoot shreds with wolfberries.

### I am a Selfish and Cruel Person

— Li Yutu

Of course, I am not saying that everyone in the world is selfish, but I dare say that most people have some selfish tendencies. Take myself as an example. Although I don't admit that I am the most selfish person in the world, I already possess many selfish characteristics. For example, for the sake of my eyes, I will cleverly find good-looking movies or novels for them to watch. For the sake of my ears, I will cleverly find good-sounding music or songs for them to listen to. For the sake of my mouth, of course, at a dinner table, I will find the best food and put it there... In short, I will seek all kinds of happiness for myself; as long as it benefits me in any way, I won't let it go.

Six months ago, because of my excessive love for my mouth, I fed it too many things and became seriously ill. It was then that I realized that I had been greatly fooled by my selfishness. The doctor forbade me from eating anything; I could only drink a little water each day. My stomach was rumbling with hunger, and my mouth was crying out for emptiness. During the ninety days in the hospital, I spent seventy-five nights dreaming of Tianjin steamed buns and Cantonese char siu.

My illness gradually entered a dangerous state. Every day, a lot of blood came out with my stool. My body became thinner and thinner day by day, and my spirit became weaker and weaker day by day. According to the doctor, it was typhoid fever with bleeding, which is a very serious condition. I anxiously begged him to treat me, and he said, "Except for first transfusing blood to save you urgently, which can temporarily prevent death, there is no other way." Because I was afraid of death, because I was selfish, I agreed.

The next day, the person who sold blood came. When I saw him, I couldn't help but be shocked.

"Can he also sell blood? He's such a thin person!" I asked the nurse in surprise.

"Of course, he sells blood after a thorough examination," she replied.

"No, you misunderstood me. I know he's been examined, but he's already so thin. Won't he get sick himself if he loses more blood?" I finally felt sympathy.

"He's willing to sell blood, so what does it matter to him!" This was the reply.

The blood seller lay down on the bed next to mine. The doctor inserted the needle into the blood vessel in his arm...

"Is there a limit to the amount?" he said with a bitter face. In that tone, I began to blame myself, "You bloodsucker!"

"Don't transfuse his blood anymore," I wanted to say, but I am a selfish animal. I was afraid that if I didn't suck enough of his blood, I wouldn't be able to avert my death. In the end, I didn't say it.

Not long after the blood transfusion, I got better. I don't remember which month it was, but on the second day, I came out of the hospital. At this time, I felt my own shame. In the less than twenty-one years of my life, I had already used cruelty, immorality, and a large amount of selfishness. That night, I didn't sleep peacefully. My conscience kept accusing me. However, humans are also very clever creatures. When they feel uneasy, they will use very nice words to comfort themselves. Of course, I also started to comfort myself. "What does it matter! Although I sucked someone else's blood, I have already paid the price. Besides, I only sucked one person's blood. How can I be considered cruel?" When I thought this, I felt very relieved. I couldn't be considered a complete sinner because there are so many people who are secretly sucking the blood of thousands or even the entire population of Shanghai!

However, I am still very afraid when I see blood. After all, I sucked someone's blood—one person's blood!

I am a selfish and cruel person!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(6) Product of Love

I don't know how long I waited, but Xiangqi finally walked in with a frown.

"... If you hadn't shouted so loudly, he probably wouldn't have seen you!" There was some resentment in Xiangqi's tone. "Although I tried to cover it up later, he also cleverly pretended not to see anything. But looking at his two flickering black eyes, I couldn't help but be afraid in my heart."

"Then should I leave here tonight?" Autumn Begonia said helplessly.

But Xiangqi shook her head hastily.

"I think he must still be hiding nearby now. Going out would only allow him to see everything clearly." Ji Zhaoxiong's sinister nature had already left a very deep impression on Xiangqi's heart in the past year. "If you want to leave, it has to be tomorrow. And I must first return to the British Concession myself and deliberately find something to keep him busy, then you can leave from here."

Xiangqi's arrangement was indeed not superfluous. Although Ji Zhaoxiong had only heard Autumn Begonia's voice, by the time he wanted to pay attention, the person had already retreated behind the screen. All he saw was half of their back. Of course, he couldn't recognize them immediately, but looking at Xiangqi's expression, he estimated that there must be some hidden secret. Although he was not loyal to Yuan Baofan, he would never let go of such an easy opportunity to make money. Therefore, after leaving the Luo family, he had been circling around Grain Rice Street, determined to uncover Xiangqi's secret and use it to extort her. Although he waited until past nine o'clock that night and still didn't see anyone come out, he hadn't given up hope and prepared to wait again the next morning. However, Xiangqi had already seen through his intentions. At eight o'clock in the morning, she returned to Yuan's mansion and used the matter of the cook getting drunk and fighting, which he had reported yesterday, to keep him busy until after lunch, when she estimated that Autumn Begonia had already boarded the train and left, and then let him go.

Even so, he later went to Grain Rice Street twice specifically, trying his best to inquire from the Luo family's neighbors, and he did get some clues.

In the blink of an eye, another three or four months had passed. Now, Xiangqi was facing a truly difficult problem: the flesh in her belly! According to the date of conception, this child was undoubtedly the product of her love with Autumn Begonia. However, the recent situation had changed, making it impossible for her to implement a method immediately. Although Autumn Begonia had already bought farmland and houses in his old hometown of Cangzhou, it was impossible to overcome this difficulty. (80)

### So It Is

— Jue Hui

Foxes and dogs collude, wolves and jackals work together. Although they try their best to conceal and cover up, putting on airs; in the end, they cannot avoid the "suspicion" of "colluding."

There are many skilled deceivers in the world; and the skilled deception of hoarders is even more "just right." So, it's no wonder that a bunch of "ignorant people" become confused and unable to distinguish right from wrong...

Those with "clear stomachs" unconsciously become complacent: thus, they publish solemn announcements, recounting a painful story, expressing "enthusiasm," and sparing no "tears and snot" for "caring about people's livelihoods." They look as if they are even more pitiful than the poor old men who have no thin porridge to drink. Truly, whoever is not moved by their "compassion" must have a "heart of stone!"

As a result, the "ignorant people" will naturally become confused and unable to distinguish, quietly and happily thinking, "We will repay you in the next life by wearing grass and carrying rings..."

In fact, to speak frankly: they are all birds of a feather, so it is!

### The Mystery of "The Tortoise and the Hare Race"

— Ji Runmo

Recently, you can often see the four characters "Tortoise and Hare Race" in the newspaper. This is used to describe the inability of prices and salaries to be proportional. Literally, I very much agree with these four characters, because according to the actual situation of the past two years, the expenditures and incomes of the salaried class do indeed show the momentum of a tortoise and hare race, that is, income moves like a tortoise, and expenditure is like a hare escaping. But unexpectedly, it made me think of this well-known story:

The story may be familiar to everyone: a hare and a tortoise race, striving for the same goal. Before taking three steps, the hare has already surpassed the tortoise by a dozen feet. After a few jumps and bounds, the hare saw that the goal was close at hand, while the tortoise was still slowly coming, far away. So, the hare thought that the championship was secure and that it might as well rest for a while in the middle to recuperate. Who knew that when it woke up, the tortoise had already occupied the top spot, while it was left far behind.

This is a deeply moving fable. Everyone who has read it is willing to imitate the tortoise's persistence and never imitate the hare's arrogance. However, is that really the case with current prices and salaries? On the surface, the rise in prices does seem like a hare escaping, and the increase in salaries does seem like a tortoise moving. But if someone asks such a question—will the nimble hare fall asleep in the middle of the race? Can the dull tortoise really reach the finish line first? I believe probably no one would dare to answer.

In principle, we may also review the past three years. In the beginning, the difference between prices and salaries was not very far, just like when the tortoise and hare first started running, looking forward to reaching the goal. However, gradually, it went from being able to look forward to it but not reach it, to not being able to look forward to it or reach it, which created the current common situation of spending tomorrow's money today and making ends meet! However, in the psychology of the masses, there is still a thought, that is, just like the protagonists in the race story, when they reach the middle of the road, prices will stay still, while salaries will advance vigorously. Now, the fact proves that this idea is very unlikely to become a reality, then the general pleas and appeals are not in vain!

In short, will the nimble hare fall asleep in the middle of the race? Can the dull tortoise really reach the destination first? In the current environment, this is a mystery, but we cannot deny the deep meaning of the fable, just as a mystery will always have a day to be revealed.
