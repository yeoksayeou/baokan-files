### Major Developments Expected in the Far East: Thailand Determined to Fight with All Its Might; Burma Officially Announces Reorganization of the National Defense Council; Takahashi Says Japan Should Cautiously Choose Its Path

Reuters, Bangkok, 13th – Qualified sources believe that Thailand has not yet escaped the crisis, especially in light of the anticipation by Cooper, the British War Cabinet's representative stationed in the Far East, that major developments are imminent. The summoning of a special cabinet meeting in Australia and Japan's new emergency measures also contribute to this sense. Simultaneously, Thailand's attitude has indeed hardened, and it no longer seems to feel its position is one of isolated helplessness. Should any unforeseen changes occur, Thailand is determined to fight with all its might to safeguard its neutrality. This firm resolution of Thailand has been further emboldened by encouraging words from as far away as London and Washington, and as near as Singapore and Rangoon. Well-informed sources believe that Thailand is now taking advantage of the current lull to carefully consider the lessons learned from the recent crisis and to revise its policies. These sources also point out that Thai officials are gradually convinced that the United States now has a better understanding of Thailand, as evidenced by the U.S. resumption of steel and machinery transport to Thailand. As for Britain, it is said that Thailand is very grateful for Britain's economizing on oil, which is in extreme demand for its own needs.

Reuters, London, 13th – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that the news carried by this newspaper, that the U.S. had sent a document to Japan requesting information on whether Japan agreed to abandon its southward advance policy and demanding a reply within a specified time, has been denied as inaccurate by official sources here today. London believes that this news is of a hoax-like nature, similar to several rumors that have spread around the world in recent days.

Reuters, Tokyo, 13th – The mouthpiece of the Foreign Ministry, the Japan Times, stated yesterday that Japan and the Soviet Union are handling their affairs in an atmosphere of quiet trust and harmony. The repeated statements of Soviet Foreign Minister Lozovsky should make the world understand that Soviet-Japanese relations are not disturbed by any "Beaufort Scale" or demands. Such rumors only indicate a neurotic relationship with the situation. Both countries now have their own difficulties in other areas. If such considerations are not sound and propagandists undermine the possibilities, it would only increase the current difficulties in the world.

Reuters, Tokyo, 13th – Retired Military Councilor, Admiral Takahashi, who served as Commander of the Combined Fleet in 1937, recently published an article in a magazine stating that the Soviet-German war has made it impossible for Japan to rely on German and Italian assistance any longer. Japan must determine its own path with the utmost "caution." The Soviet-German war has made it impossible for Japan to obtain supplies from the Axis powers, and Germany seems to have encountered a very serious crisis because the Soviet Union's resistance is not as easy to collapse as France's. Takahashi also supported former Foreign Minister Matsuoka, saying that Japan's conclusion of a neutrality pact with the Soviet Union to facilitate its mission of establishing a co-prosperity sphere in Asia was perfectly justifiable. However, he believed that Japan's vigilance against the Soviet Union should not be relaxed for a moment, because Moscow has never abandoned its dream of world revolution.

Reuters, Rangoon, 13th – The Burmese government announced yesterday the reorganization of the Burmese National Defense Council, with the Burmese Prime Minister as Vice-Chairman. The Chairman will remain the Governor of Burma. This is an important step in the Burmese constitution and national defense. The Council will hold regular meetings to be fully informed of the various developments in the war situation, and the Governor will seek the Council's opinion on various policy issues related to Burmese defense and foreign affairs. The Council was initially established at the end of September 1939 to ensure the rapid consideration and decision-making on military issues outside the scope of the Command Headquarters. After this reorganization, the majority of the members belong to the Burmese people.

Reuters, Bangkok, 13th – Responsible parties here have frankly denied that any reinforcements have been sent to the Vietnamese border. According to authoritative sources, the rumors circulating in Bangkok that the international express train between Thailand and Malaya will be changed from twice a week to once, or that the Thai-Malay border has been sealed off, are all inaccurate.

United Press, Manila, 13th – Travelers arriving here from Saigon today stated that there are currently 30,000 fully equipped Japanese troops in the Saigon area, and 20 Japanese warships. The people of Saigon believe that the Japanese troops are preparing to enter Thailand or Burma. They also claimed that Japan has occupied the entire southern part of Vietnam, and the departure of French ships must first obtain permission from the Japanese authorities. Since the occupation, commerce in Saigon has largely come to a standstill. It is said that there is a severe shortage of diamonds and other gems in the area, as French people now prefer to purchase easily movable gems and ornaments. The 55 people who recently arrived here from Saigon are all Americans, most of whom are passing through here to return to the United States.

Reuters, Saigon, 13th – The leader of the Thai Border Survey Committee, Sala Bhairaja, recently stated that if Thailand is attacked, it needs and welcomes foreign assistance. The recent statements by Britain and the United States regarding Thailand's position are not merely official documents issued to Thailand, but the assistance mentioned is what Thailand welcomes. The Border Survey Delegation is scheduled to begin its meeting on Monday, with a Japanese representative as Chairman. The meeting is expected to last half a month, after which they will meet again at various points along the border.

### Many Japanese Warships Arrive in Saigon; Matsumiya Appointed Ambassador to Vietnam

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – Yesterday, more Japanese warships arrived in Saigon. Lieutenant General Iida, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces stationed in Vietnam, met with the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese fleet stationed in Vietnam for a long time on a warship in Saigon.

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 13th – It was announced here yesterday that the Japanese government has appointed Matsumiya as Ambassador to Vietnam in accordance with the Franco-Japanese Agreement of August 30, 1940. Matsumiya will handle consular affairs and various issues related to the stationing of Japanese troops in Vietnam. France has accepted Japan's desire in the spirit of cooperation between the two countries.

United Press, Washington, 13th – The House of Representatives passed a bill yesterday declaring the nation in a state of emergency and extending the terms of service for conscripts, National Guardsmen, reservists, and registered regulars by eighteen months. The Senate also passed the bill, with a very close vote of 202 to 200. House Speaker Rayburn re-voted on the bill, but the result was the same. The closeness of this vote was due to the fact that more members who had previously voted against reconsidering the bill had left before the final vote. The vote against reconsideration was 215 to 190. House leaders said that this was an unusual situation that once threatened the government's victory. The bill was passed after a fierce debate. At that time, Massachusetts Democratic Congressman McCormack warned that "the interests of the nation are above the interests of individuals, and the time is running out. Our enemies have already taken action. We know that Japan is advancing, and Vichy has fallen into the hands of the Germans." The House of Representatives passed the amendment of the Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, Democratic Congressman May, by a voice vote, limiting the extension of military service to eighteen months. This bill has already been passed by the Senate. Previously, the government had won a noteworthy victory in the House of Representatives by a vote of 185 to 146, defeating an amendment by Republican Congressman. At that time, the government declared that national interests were now in danger. In this debate, the threat of Japan to the United States was constantly mentioned. New York Republican Congressman Wadsworth supported the extension of military service. He said, "America's main interests are already threatened by Japan. Our main supply resources and supply routes are threatened by the success of the Japanese fascist government." He also said that Hitler is making various preparations in Spanish Morocco. When he is ready, he will issue a signal for action in North Africa, and Japan will issue the same signal at that time. Texas Democratic Congressman Mason said that Hitler has achieved more than originally planned. He has conquered thirteen countries and rules no less than 200 million people in Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland. All of Europe is within his sphere of influence. The United States' disbanding military service is what Germany and Japan urgently seek. We are now in the most terrifying crisis in history."

### Sino-French Relations Rapidly Deteriorating; Possible Severance of Diplomatic Relations

Reuters, Chongqing, 13th – Chinese sources here are not surprised by reports of the transfer of troops from Vietnam to the Yunnan-Guangxi border to protect the flanks of the Japanese army. Although the French authorities have repeatedly assured that they will do their best to resist the demands of Germany and Japan, Sino-French relations are now rapidly deteriorating. According to reliable sources from Vichy, Japan is now adding strong pressure to actively participate in Axis activities. Chinese sources believe that Vichy is now completely under Axis control and can no longer be held responsible for its actions. The result may lead to a sudden break in relations between Chongqing and Vichy. According to the Chinese interpretation, if the report of the troop transfer from Vietnam is true, it further proves Japan's intention to advance into Thailand and that Tokyo has disregarded the warnings of the British Foreign Secretary and the U.S. Secretary of State and is determined to proceed with its southward advance program. Because unless Japan advances westward or southward from Vietnam, there is little need to protect its flanks. Therefore, it is believed that the current stalemate in the Pacific situation will be difficult to maintain for long. In the near future, it seems that a storm is coming.

### General Embargo Implemented in Vietnam

Reuters, Tokyo, 13th – According to Japanese semi-official sources in Hanoi, the Vietnamese government has declared a general embargo on all exported goods, effective today. Officials declined to explain the reason for this move, but said that it would not affect specially authorized transportation.

### Three Key U.S. Government Officials Hold Secret Meeting

United Press, Washington, 13th

The three top giants of the government, Secretary of State Hull, Naval Secretary Knox, and Army Secretary Stimson, held a meeting yesterday. The subject of the discussion is unknown.

Vatican Newspaper Predicts War in the Far East

United Press, Vatican City, 13th – The Osservatore Romano is pessimistic about the situation in the Far East and predicts that war may break out in the Pacific soon. The newspaper, which is the semi-official organ of the Holy See, strongly advocates the military effectiveness of the Netherlands in its commentary and says that Japan may establish a free Siberian state. The newspaper stated, "Governments related to the Far East have successively adopted various defensive or offensive plans, thereby creating an even denser haze."

U.S. to Build Two Large Air Force Bases

Reuters, Washington, 13th – The United States is building two large air force bases in Maine, near the New Brunswick border, at a cost of approximately £5.5 million. This is the starting point for the delivery of American-made bombers and other warplanes to Britain on this island. The two bases are located in Blethenick Island and Houlton, and the runway on Blethenick Island is over a mile long. It is reported that among the many officers stationed at these two bases, there will be some representatives of the British Air Force.

### U.S. Congress Passes Extension of Military Service; Republican Lawmakers Issue Warning: Germany and Japan Will Take New Action

United Press, Washington, 13th – The House of Representatives passed a bill yesterday declaring the nation in a state of emergency and extending the terms of service for conscripts, National Guardsmen, reservists, and registered regulars by eighteen months. The Senate also passed the bill, with a very close vote of 202 to 200. House Speaker Rayburn re-voted on the bill, but the result was the same. The closeness of this vote was due to the fact that more members who had previously voted against reconsidering the bill had left before the final vote.

Editorial

### Thailand's Firm Declaration

Looking back at the history of two years ago, everything that is happening today on the Indochinese peninsula is almost a complete re-enactment of the Polish situation. If Poland was the fuse that ignited the European war, then Thailand is now playing the same role in the Far East.

At that time, under the leadership of Colonel Beck, Poland pursued a purely speculative foreign policy, constantly wavering between Britain and France and Germany, but it was more inclined to Germany and adopted a respectful and distant attitude towards its neighbor, the Soviet Union. When Germany used the Sudetenland issue as an excuse to dismember Czechoslovakia, Poland also shared a piece of the pie as an accomplice, but in the blink of an eye, a similar crisis fell on Poland itself. This tragic page only makes people sigh and pity, but in the past two years, Thailand has been following in Poland's footsteps, and the Thai-Vietnamese war last winter to Japan's recent coveting of Thailand is in line with the previous Eastern European development from the Sudetenland incident to Germany's request to Poland to take back Danzig and the corridor. The only remaining question is whether the Far Eastern War will follow suit and break out.

The way for small and weak countries to survive is never to make friends on all sides and beg for mercy from great powers, but to distinguish right from wrong and firmly defend their position. If Poland had been able to firmly respect itself, not be greedy for immediate gains, and assist each other with other small Central European countries to expand the momentum of the Little Entente, and treat Germany with a solemn attitude to avoid inciting its contempt and covetousness. In addition, it should have concluded friendly relations with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, which also stood on the anti-aggression stance, to prepare for unforeseen circumstances. Not only would the European war not have broken out, Poland would not have been destroyed, and most of the territory of Europe would have maintained the original state after the previous European war. At present, the Polish people are struggling to rebuild their country, and there is no need to settle past historical traces at this moment, but this lesson is what those who are in the same situation as Thailand should pay attention to and learn from.

Thailand, with its small population, is located in the strategic area of the South China Sea, and its independent survival is mostly based on the balance of power between Britain and France on the Indochinese peninsula. This is probably why the Thai authorities have tried so hard to befriend Japan. But they probably never thought that this would be tantamount to scheming with a tiger for its skin, leading the country into a dangerous situation, and as for how to cooperate with other small and weak nations in the East in a similar situation to jointly resist aggression, the Thai authorities disdained to care about it. On the contrary, they sometimes inevitably catered to the demands of the aggressors and hurt the friendship of China. This is the most regrettable point in the past. When France was defeated and Vietnam gradually became a springboard for Japan's southward advance, the original balance of power on the Indochinese peninsula was broken. Japan, which was advancing southward, and the most important military bases of Britain and the United States in the Far East were only separated by Thailand. In other words, Thailand has formed a point that these two conflicting forces are bound to contend for. There is no room for the Thai authorities to avoid or maneuver any more. This situation is indeed more difficult than that of Poland two years ago.

The Thai authorities are not completely unaware of this secretly approaching crisis. For example, after the end of the Thai-Vietnamese war this spring, as generally expected, Thailand would inevitably intensify its combination with Japan to the point where it could not recover. However, in fact, there has been little significant progress in Japanese-Thai relations. On the contrary, various contacts and visits have been carried out between Britain and Thailand. This is naturally because Thailand is too dependent on Britain economically. Whether it is the import of heavy industrial products and oil or the export of local products such as rice, tin, rubber, and Malipo (for shipbuilding), it needs British assistance. On the other hand, it may not be that the Thai authorities have already begun to be wary of possible aggression. In the middle of last month, precisely when the situation in Vietnam was extremely tense, Thailand had repeatedly issued statements, declaring its neutral position, but it still did not dare to openly state its determination to defend its territory and resist aggression. When the recognition of the Manchurian organization and the granting of loans to Japan were realized, the world was even more deeply worried that Thailand was about to become a sequel to Vietnam. Britain and the United States simultaneously issued serious statements expressing concern about the Thai situation on the 6th of this month. This seems to have made a deep impression in Thailand. The Thai government issued a communiqué on the 9th, stating that it would not hesitate to fight if necessary. Thai Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram even claimed the day before yesterday that "Thailand would rather die than abandon the country to any aggressor or allow any foreigner to interfere in Thai internal affairs." This clear attitude of resisting aggression is a sign that Thailand's foreign policy has changed from a speculative and opportunistic approach to a solemn and resolute stance.

The crisis in the South Pacific is still evolving, but the future development trend is extremely clear: if Thailand is invaded, it will definitely rise up to resist, and Britain and the United States will also consider it to be the arrival of the final juncture and take decisive measures. This is not only clearer than the Eastern European situation related to Poland before the outbreak of the European war, but the comparison of the strength between the anti-aggression front and the aggressive forces in the Far East is also not comparable to the strength of Germany and the Soviet Union and Britain, France, and Poland at that time. Because these firm expressions were issued too late, their effectiveness in preventing turmoil has been greatly reduced, but even if the aggressors do not see the opportunity and restrain themselves, the future success or failure has long been determined, and there is no need to panic or fear.

### Australia Makes Important Decisions Regarding the Future Overall War Situation; Parliament to Review the Question of Stabilizing the East; New Zealand Stands Shoulder to Shoulder with Britain

United Press, Melbourne, 13th – Prime Minister Menzies announced yesterday that he is convening Parliament to hear a statement on the Far Eastern situation on August 20. After Parliament is convened, a closed-door meeting may be held to review the entire question of the Far East. The Cabinet has also discussed all issues related to the major era, all related to the Imperial Government, and has made major decisions with far-reaching effects on the future overall war situation, including the Near East situation. It also stated that recent events have led to further discussions by Australian representatives stationed in London, and decisions on imperial policy and military strategy have already been made there. The Cabinet unanimously requested that he travel to London as soon as possible. Observers say that the Labor Party supports Menzies' trip to London. During his absence, Fadden will serve as acting prime minister, with full power to make all decisions.

Reuters, Sydney, 13th – Two members of the Australian War Advisory Council, Evatt and Beasley of the Labor Party, urged the Labor Party yesterday to prepare to take over the Australian government. Evatt argued that elections must be avoided at present, but said that Parliament must respond to the increasingly fierce public opinion against the Menzies government, because the people are dissatisfied with the work of various departments, which is extremely important domestically. Evatt referred to Menzies' suggestion that he should go to London, saying that this is not a question of Menzies going to London, but a question of whether he should go as the Australian Prime Minister. If the situation is as serious as described, the Prime Minister should stay in Australia.

Havas, London, 12th – It was officially announced that New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser is currently consulting here and will return to his country at the end of the month.

Reuters, London, 13th – New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser said in a broadcast last night that the situation in the Far East is indeed serious, but it is not too late to turn back from the brink. If the various efforts of democratic countries to maintain peace in the Pacific ultimately fail, and the tide of war extends to New Zealand and Australia, then the self-governing territories will show the same strong determination as the mother country. Regardless of the consequences, New Zealand will stand shoulder to shoulder with Britain until victory is achieved.

United Press, Washington, 13th – Georgia Democratic Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, said yesterday that he believes that if Japan engages in further aggression, it is "certainly" possible that the United States will completely cut off all commercial relations with Japan. Observers feel that the United States may ban all oil shipments to Japan.

United Press, Tokyo, 12th – The Yomiuri Shimbun said that Britain and the United States are now only using "bragging" methods to drive other countries to fight for them. At the same time, the South Pacific map recently published in Japan has listed the islands in the middle of the Philippine and Vietnamese coasts as Japanese territory. These maps place the territory that Japan recognizes as its own ninety miles deep into Balal Island and three hundred and fifty miles deep into Manila.

American Residents in Japan Gradually Entering Difficulties

United Press, Tokyo, 13th – The situation of American residents in Japan is becoming more and more serious today. Since the recent promulgation of the freezing order, American residents' cash assets are about to be exhausted. Well-informed sources in the American business community believe that American interests throughout Japan are on the verge of complete collapse, because the freezing order gives the Japanese the opportunity to put unprecedented pressure on them. Changxing Shipping Company has ordered all its offices in Japan to close and its personnel to return home. It is rumored that Citibank also plans to contract its business, close its branches in Kobe and Osaka, and close its branch in Tokyo.

Reuters, Tokyo, 13th – The Ministry of Finance announced yesterday that Japan may exempt the funds of various countries in Japan from freezing based on reciprocal measures. This method depends on the treatment that Japanese people receive in countries that implement the freezing order. A week ago, the British Ambassador, the Australian Minister, the Canadian Chargé d'Affaires, and the staff of the embassies in Britain had their funds exempted from freezing, and British commercial firms managed entirely by Japanese people also enjoy this treatment.

### Under the Clear Moonlight, An Air Battle Occurs Over Chongqing; Several Japanese Planes Attack in Five Waves, and the Reporter's Guesthouse Is Completely Destroyed

Chongqing – Today marks the sixth day of Japanese air raids on Chongqing. As of 3:00 PM today, air raid alerts have lasted for twelve and a half hours. Since the bombings began on August 8th, the total duration of air raid alerts has approached ninety hours. The Western suburbs reporter's guesthouse, where foreign correspondents were staying, was completely destroyed this morning when a high-explosive bomb landed five yards away. The offices of Reuters, Associated Press, Life Magazine, The Times, The New York Times, International News Service, and NBC were among those destroyed. The reporter's guesthouse was completed two years ago and had withstood hundreds of bombings and suffered damage several times. Now, it is a pile of rubble. Today's bombing began at 1:30 AM, with five Japanese planes bombing the western suburbs. Chinese fighter planes engaged in fierce air combat with the Japanese planes under the clear moonlight. This morning at 8:00 AM, a second wave of twenty-three Japanese planes attacked the western suburbs, destroying the reporter's guesthouse. A third wave of eighteen Japanese planes bombed the area two hours later, dropping incendiary bombs that caused a large fire. At noon, another twenty-two Japanese planes bombed the western suburbs. The area was subjected to a final, fifth bombing by five Japanese planes at 2:00 PM. (Reuters, 13th)

Chongqing – Eighty-six Japanese planes attacked Chongqing in batches over the past three days, indiscriminately bombing the city and suburbs and dropping large quantities of incendiary bombs. Fortunately, protective measures were comprehensive, and damage was minimal. The morale of the citizens remains calm. (Telegram, 13th)

Chongqing – As of 3:00 PM today, Japanese bombers have bombed Chongqing six times. This marks the sixth consecutive day of Japanese air raids on Chongqing. From 1:30 AM to 3:00 PM, the public only had seventy-eight minutes to leave the air raid shelters. The rest of the time was spent under continuous alerts. The reporter's club was destroyed during the second wave of attacks today, and the offices of foreign journalists were all destroyed. (United Press, 13th)

Chongqing – It was learned today that during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing last Friday, the U.S. Navy lost ten barrels of gasoline. The gasoline was transported from the Burma Road and was being transferred from Navy vehicles to sand barges for transport to the U.S. gunboat "Tutuila" on the opposite bank when Japanese planes bombed the safety zone on the southern bank of the upper Yangtze River, destroying the gasoline. It was also learned that the damage suffered by the U.S. gunboat "Tutuila" during a Japanese bombing in July was actually greater than initially reported. Japanese bombs landed only eight feet from the ship, damaging its stern. (Central News Agency, 13th)

### Chinese Troops in Western Hubei Recover Important Strongholds; The Recovery of Longwan and Zhangjinhe Is Anticipated; Chinese Troops Capture Xinshèng on the South Bank of Taihu Lake

Changde – A telegram from the front reports that the Japanese troops in Shashi and Qianjiang, suffering heavy losses in personnel and equipment due to repeated attacks by Chinese forces, launched an offensive on the 3rd of this month with a mixed force of 5,000-6,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, supported by aircraft and artillery fire, in an attempt to encircle Chinese forces. Having anticipated this plan, the Chinese forces sent units to conduct delaying actions while swiftly transferring their main force to induce the Japanese troops deep into the lake and marsh areas, where they were dealt a heavy blow. The Japanese troops ventured into the Chinese encirclement. Thereupon, the Chinese forces launched attacks from all sides. After days of fierce fighting in areas such as Xulijiachang, Yujiabu on the east bank of Bailu Lake, and Shagangchang on the west bank, the Japanese troops collapsed by the evening of the 10th. The Chinese forces seized a large number of Japanese machine guns and other military supplies and are currently pursuing them on all fronts. (Telegram, 12th)

Changde – A telegram from a front-line base reports that after capturing Xulijiachang and Shagangchang, the Chinese forces on the north bank took advantage of their momentum and recovered Longwan and Zhangjinhe on the 11th. The Chinese pursuit units from the Hao Xue area are currently advancing towards Zifusi. (Telegram, 12th)

Changde – A telegram from a base north of the river reports that the Japanese troops in Shayang held a meeting there on the 3rd of this month to mourn Japanese General Nikaku, confirming that the Japanese officer was indeed killed by Chinese forces. Nikaku held the rank of major general and was the commander of the infantry of the Japanese 39th Division, as well as the commander of the Japanese garrison in Jingzhou and Shashi. It is rumored that he was ambushed and killed by a Chinese unit near Shili Pu on October 28th. (Telegram, 12th)

Chongqing – It was reported that a unit of Chinese forces on the south bank of Taihu Lake attacked Xinshèng Town, a Japanese stronghold northwest of Jiaxing, on the evening of the 8th, breaking into the town in one fell swoop. The battle continued until dawn on the 9th, when the Japanese troops were routed. The Chinese forces then recaptured the town. (Telegram, 12th)

Owen Lattimore Delivers a Speech

Chongqing – Owen Lattimore, a personal political advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, delivered a speech at a banquet held by the People's Foreign Relations Association last night, stating that American aid to China is not temporary and will continue even after the war. However, Lattimore solemnly stated that the United States will not interfere in China's internal affairs, as China must develop its own organization to address various issues. Lattimore delivered the speech in fluent Chinese for nearly forty minutes. (Reuters, 13th)

### German Forces Launch a Pincer Offensive; Fierce Battles Rage in Four Key Areas; The Fighting in Ukraine Is Particularly Intense; The German Advance on Kiev Is Repelled

London, 13th (Reuters) – For the sake of convenience, the Soviet-German front can be divided into four key areas: (1) The Leningrad Line, (2) The Moscow Line, (3) The Kiev Line, and (4) The Odessa Line. Minor battles are also taking place in Murmansk in the far north and in Estonia. These two areas have not seen the full force of the fighting, nor have they achieved much success, as the Germans consider them minor issues. The German advance on Leningrad can be further divided into four areas: east and west of Lake Ladoga, and north and south of Lake Peipus. Constant fighting continues on these fronts, but the area is mostly forests and swamps, which favors defense, and the Soviet forces are rarely giving ground. The main German offensive is directed at Moscow, where the two armies are currently deadlocked. The German salient extends as far as Smolensk, and while the Germans are currently exerting pressure in various locations near Smolensk to tie down Soviet forces, their main advance seems to have changed direction and is now aimed at Odessa on the Black Sea coast. The German forces advancing on Kiev are attempting a massive pincer movement to flank Kiev, but they have been repelled at Korosten (ninety miles northwest of Kiev) and Belaya Tserkov (forty-five miles southwest of Kiev). The German pressure and Soviet resistance have not diminished in recent days. The Germans are still trying to find weaknesses in the Soviet defenses and are therefore turning towards Odessa, attacking from Uman in the south. This move threatens the rear of the Soviet forces defending the west bank of the Dniester River. If the Germans can break through at one point, the Soviet forces in Kiev and Odessa may be flanked. It is rumored that the Germans have reached a point seventy miles northeast of Nikolaev, but this has not been confirmed. Even if the Germans have advanced to that point, it is only a column of tanks, which has nuisance value but cannot hold ground without infantry support. It appears that there is currently no German infantry to support them. Since Monday, the situation in that area has changed very little, which can be inferred from the German communique on Tuesday not mentioning it.

Moscow, 13th (United Press) – The fighting in Ukraine was concentrated yesterday in the areas of Korosten and Uman, which are favorable for the use of mechanized units before the end of autumn. The Germans are trying to cut off Odessa, an important Ukrainian port, so there are fierce battles on both the north and south sides of Kiev. According to yesterday's announcement, Soviet forces attacked the Korosten area yesterday, destroying a column of German tanks. It was also stated that the Soviet forces, in cooperation with tanks, heavy artillery, air force, and infantry, destroyed fifty German tanks, two anti-aircraft batteries, and many other Nazi equipment.

London, 13th (Reuters) – The German forces are currently fighting desperately in the Soviet war to break through to the Black Sea. It was claimed last night that they had reached the coast in front of Odessa, but according to news from Moscow, this is not credible. The latest Soviet communique does not mention any major progress by the German forces in that area or any other part of the front. According to informed sources in London, small German units may have crossed the Dniester River north of Odessa. The Germans often exaggerate minor successes by their vanguard units into major victories. The Soviet forces must have completely harvested the crops in the fertile land that the Germans hoped to occupy. The Soviet Union is currently harvesting the fields behind the front lines and in areas not yet reached by the Germans. It is said that this year's harvest has broken records. The communique did not mention any significant changes in other parts of the front. The defenders of Kiev are still holding out. News from Moscow mentions fighting near Korosten, eighty miles northwest of the city, where Soviet forces are said to have routed a German column, destroying fifty of its tanks.

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to a German military communique issued yesterday, the rapid advance of the German forces in southern Ukraine has led to the occupation of large areas of territory. Several units have now reached the Black Sea coast. The Dnieper River south of Kiev is under German artillery fire. Several railways have also been brought under the control of the German forces. The Dnieper River is 700 meters wide in that area, so Soviet transportation in that area is in a state of confusion.

### Military Experts Comment on the War Situation; The Reasons for the Nazi Change in Strategy

London, 13th (Reuters) – A Reuters correspondent reports from Moscow that foreign commentators have suggested that the German thrust southwards is aimed at seizing Baku. Locals point out that this shows a lack of understanding of Soviet geography. Others have said that the Germans will attempt to seize the Crimea by sea, but this is also unlikely, as the Soviet Black Sea Fleet has many submarines and other warships that are more than capable of resisting such German action. The German offensive in Ukraine can be seen as German acknowledgement of the failure of the blitzkrieg to capture Leningrad and Moscow. The statement by a German spokesman that the attack on Moscow and Leningrad is not yet over is also significant, as the Germans are making this statement to prevent the Soviets from transferring large forces to support Ukraine. If the Germans were able to capture Moscow, Ukraine would be difficult to defend. Ukraine could be regarded as the ultimate objective of the German offensive, as the weather in Ukraine is still suitable for military operations in October, unlike Moscow and Leningrad, where it has been raining continuously since September. The Germans are currently attacking the grain-producing areas of Ukraine, but the crops there have already been harvested and moved elsewhere. The Germans have so far failed to penetrate the important industrial center area near the mouth of the Dniester River. Even if the Germans continue to advance, Kiev can still serve as the Soviet Tobruk to stop the Germans. The Soviet people are now confident that even if they temporarily abandon the flooded farmland, they can still hold the industrial area downstream of the Dniester River. In addition to the Red Army, there are also workers there, and their systematic resistance is enough to contain the Germans.

### The Red Army Implements a Scorched-Earth Policy; Smolensk Becomes a Ruin

Stockholm, 13th (Reuters) – According to a dispatch from Berlin in the “National Daily” here, an eyewitness who inspected Smolensk after the German forces captured it at great cost after weeks of bloody fighting was impressed by the fact that Smolensk has become a dead city similar to Pompeii (an ancient Roman city destroyed by a volcano). German newspapers also reported that Smolensk was completely destroyed. When the German vanguard reached the city, they had to withdraw because the houses were burning so fiercely and the heat was unbearable. Soviet forces continued to hold the Smolensk airfield for several days, setting up artillery positions and opening fire fiercely on the German forces after they entered the city. German military sources confirmed that the Soviet people are still conducting armed resistance in many places and are trying to destroy the remaining buildings and the grain stores in the German rear. The German forces are severely punishing any civilians who offer even the slightest resistance with savage methods. The Nazis have appointed a White Russian lawyer as the mayor of the ruined city.

### Soviet and German Air Forces Retaliate Against Each Other; Berlin and Moscow Are Attacked

Moscow, 13th (TASS) – Soviet aircraft attacked Berlin again last night, dropping powerful incendiary and explosive bombs on military targets, causing fires and explosions. All of our aircraft returned safely to their bases.

Moscow, 13th (United Press) – Moscow was subjected to its seventeenth air raid early this morning, but it was the shortest in recent days. German bombers were unable to reach the center of the city. The emergency alert began at 12:40 AM and was lifted at 2:15 AM.

### The Red Army Fights for Three Days and Nights; The German 68th Division Is Annihilated

Moscow, 13th (Reuters) – The Soviet Information Bureau announced today the annihilation of the German 68th Division, saying that the great battle lasted for about three days. During the battle, the Nazi forces attempted a "spiritual attack." Two battalions of daredevils from the 188th Infantry Regiment advanced in close formation to the front of the Soviet positions. The Soviet forces ignored them until they approached, then showered them with machine-gun fire. The battlefield was littered with hundreds of piles of dead and wounded German soldiers. In this battle, the German forces suffered 7,500 casualties, lost fifteen tanks, and a large number of other military equipment.

### Britain and the Soviet Union Offer Guarantees of Assistance to Turkey; They Also Declare Their Respect for the Montreux Convention; Turkish Suspicions About the Soviet Union Are Completely Eliminated

London, 13th (Reuters) – It was officially announced that Britain and the Soviet Union jointly sent a note to Turkey stating that if Turkey is attacked, Britain and the Soviet Union will provide assistance. On August 10th, the British and Soviet ambassadors to Turkey visited the Turkish Foreign Ministry and informed them that the British and Soviet governments have no aggressive intentions or demands regarding the Straits and remain committed to the Montreux Convention. Both governments are prepared to carefully maintain the territorial integrity of Turkey. If Turkey is attacked by a European country, both governments are prepared to provide support to Turkey.

Ankara, 13th (Reuters) – The Soviet statement to Turkey has aroused deep satisfaction here and is considered extremely important. This is the second time that the Soviet Union has announced its readiness to provide all possible assistance to Turkey if it is invaded. The Soviet Union has now taken France’s position in Ankara and replaced it. This action can be called timely and can eliminate any Turkish suspicions about the Soviet Union. Turkey expressed a warm welcome after the British and Soviet ambassadors explained their countries' attitudes towards Turkey.

London, 13th (Reuters) – German and Italian propaganda has repeatedly tried to sow discord between Britain and Turkey, but has ultimately failed. This joint guarantee to Turkey by Britain and the Soviet Union is intended to eliminate the effects of Axis propaganda and dispel any Turkish suspicions that Britain and the Soviet Union have reached an understanding or compromise that is detrimental to Turkey. Turkey expressed a warm welcome after the British and Soviet ambassadors explained their countries' attitudes towards Turkey.

The German Ambassador to Turkey

London, 13th (Reuters) – Radio Paris reports that the German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, has left Ankara for Berlin.

### The Eastern Battlefield Is a Matter of Life and Death; Britain and the Soviet Union Warn Iran; Nazi Party Activities Contain Danger; Absolutely No Laxity in Neutrality Will Be Allowed

Cairo, 13th (Reuters) – Although the British and Soviet missions in the Iranian capital have taken parallel and concrete actions to make Iran aware of the dangers of the influx of Nazi Party members, the Iranian government is still not fully aware of the seriousness of the situation. According to reliable unofficial sources, the Iranian government is comparing the number of British and German people in the country, but does not realize that most of the British are employees of oil companies and other companies, who are long-term residents, while the Germans are new arrivals with the characteristics of a fifth column. When the Soviet government is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with Germany, it has made it clear to Iran that the Soviet Union will not allow Iran to relax its neutrality in the slightest, allowing the fifth column to carry out its activities in the Soviet rear. At the same time, Britain has also made a similarly positive statement. It is hoped that the Iranian government will pay attention to these kind and sincere warnings and try to expel the Nazi Party members. What these Germans are seeking is not only detrimental to the interests of the Allied Powers in the Middle East, but also detrimental to Iran itself. It is said that a large number of Germans have been traveling to Iran in recent days, so the situation is still worrying.

Tehran, 13th (Reuters)

Local newspapers claim that Iran has not had any new developments due to the current international situation. Iran has always maintained neutrality. The rumors reported by foreign newspapers and radio that German experts and travelers are flocking into the country are all untrue. The government has stated that all foreigners are under strict government surveillance and will not be allowed to take any action that goes beyond the law. The newspapers also criticized British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons, saying that it should be noted that today's Iran is no longer the Iran of 1914-1918.

### The Soviet Union Uses New Weapons in the War Against Finland

Shells Filled with Gasoline

Stockholm, 13th (Reuters) – Soviet battle reports in the “Democratic Daily” stated that the Soviet Union is applying a new type of weapon which are shells filled with gasoline. When they explode, the gasoline spray can reach up to two hundred feet. These shells are designed to ignite fires within forests. This is followed by continued fierce gunfire to hinder the enemy from extinguishing these fires. Currently, several Finnish soldiers have been severely burned by these fires and their lives are in grave danger.

Iron Bridge Destroyed on the Danube River

Therefore the warning is no longer applicable,

London, 13th (Reuters) – According to Soviet official communiqués, one of the world’s largest and most strategically-important bridges was destroyed by Soviet aircraft. This is the Romanian Iron Bridge that stretches over the Danube River. The location is in the area around Cernauti, 100 miles away from the Black Sea Commercial Port of Constanta. The bridge is 1700 meters long, and contains the railroads and oil pipelines that connect various key Romanian Industrial areas to the Black Sea coast.

Two Former Cabinet Members from the Netherlands Are Jailed by Germany

London, 13th (Reuters) – According to well-informed Dutch sources, the Former Minister of Finance of the Netherlands, Welter, and the Former Dutch Minister of Defense, Van Dijk, have been arrested and jailed in a concentration camp by German authorities.

Japanese Residents of Australia Prepare to Withdraw

Sydney, 13th (Reuters) – The Japanese vessel, the "Kashima Maru," that arrived here on August 9th, will load and transport over a hundred Japanese merchants back to Japan when it departs. Most of these Japanese merchants are excessive employees working for the Japanese trading firms of both Sydney and Melbourne. The shipping schedule has yet to be determined. It is expected that the ship will be permitted to load cargo of the same value as what it offloaded. It will also be allowed to load 5,000 bales of wool that were already purchased prior to the freezing of Japanese assets in Brisbane. All exported goods from Australia are required to be on the list of permitted exportable items.

### British Planes Fly to Germany by the Thousands in Batches; Launching Large-Scale Daylight Raids; Cologne as the Focus of Bombing Targets; Widespread Destruction of Important Industries

United Press, London, 13th – As a result of discussions between the American and Soviet air forces, various proofs now indicate that the Red Army Air Force and the Royal Air Force are conducting "pincer" air strikes on Germany. It is widely believed that Soviet aircraft are concentrating on attacking northeastern Germany, while the Royal Air Force is concentrating on northwestern and western Germany. In the future, during the long nights, Berlin will be visited by British or Soviet air forces every night.

International News Service, London, 13th – It is said today that 1,000 British aircraft, participating in the Royal Air Force's largest daylight raid, flew in formation over the Rhineland yesterday, heavily bombing Cologne and inflicting widespread damage on important wartime industries. The German Air Force immediately retaliated, attacking East Anglia, South Wales, the northwest Midlands, and northern England. The British Air Ministry announced that the number of bombers used in the Royal Air Force's large-scale air raids on Germany and German-occupied territories would be the highest ever, including some American pilots.

Reuters, London, 13th – An Air Ministry communiqué stated that six squadrons of British Blenheim bombers flew into the Rhineland yesterday morning, bombing the Gwatlachi and Knasack power plants in Cologne. British fighters escorted them to Antwerp, after which the British bombers flew alone, constantly maintaining an altitude of no more than a hundred feet, penetrating 150 miles into heavily defended German territory, and arriving in Cologne at 11:30 a.m., dropping a large number of bombs, hitting the two power plants, causing fires. British fighters met the returning bombers near Antwerp, escorting them across the North Sea back to England, while a large squadron of British fighters patrolled the skies off the Dutch coast to assist. At the same time, British Hampton bombers, escorted by fighters, attacked railways near Saint-Omer in northern France and a curtain factory near Cosnes. Three enemy fighters were shot down. British Fortress aircraft also took off to bomb the De Koie airfield, various targets in the Cologne area, and the port of Essendon. The British lost a total of eleven Blenheim bombers and eight fighters. Yesterday, British aircraft soared over the southeast coast, attacking targets in northern and inland France throughout the day. The aircraft formed V-shaped and diamond-shaped formations, flying at high altitudes, with residents looking up at the endless stream of aircraft flying overhead until late at night. A Reuters air force commentator said that although Cologne had been attacked hundreds of times since the start of the war, yesterday's Blenheim raid by British aircraft was only the second large-scale attack on the city. It may have been the most intense bombing of German territory in daylight, and the distance the British aircraft flew over enemy territory was longer than previous raids, carrying very heavy bombs. Responsible officials said that the British Air Force's bombing of Germany this summer would be no less intense than the German air raids on England last winter. German communiqués, as usual, referred to "one British aircraft" or a small squadron of enemy aircraft, regardless of whether the British aircraft attacking were two, thirty, or more than three hundred. At present, it is common for each British air raid on Germany to involve more than three hundred aircraft. In the three weeks of June and July this year, British aircraft dropped over 2,000 tons of bombs on the Ruhr area, 1,000 tons on Cologne, and 500 tons on Bilefeld. Every night, more than 100 British bombers constantly bombarded Germany, and this number is bound to gradually increase. Last winter, German bombers attacking Coventry carried one to one and a half tons of bombs, but the new British bombers now being deployed can carry five to seven tons of bombs. An attack by one hundred of these bombers is actually more intense than any German bombing raid on England. Furthermore, the new British bombs are not only larger but also have a stronger explosive power. 2,000-pound bombs are now only regarded as "medium-sized" bombs. The Germans claimed that their bombing of Britain in the last month, April, broke records in terms of the number of bombs dropped, but it still did not match the number of bombs dropped by the British Air Force in Germany in June.

Reuters, London, 13th – An Air Ministry communiqué stated that last night, British bombers braved severe weather to attack various parts of Germany. The main targets were industries in Berlin, Magdeburg, and Xingha Zhufu, and the Krupp armaments factory in Essen. A major fire broke out in Berlin, causing significant damage. In addition, Stettin Keel, Bilefeld, Vosnabuluck, Duisburg, and Cologne were also bombed.

British Legless Pilot Buddy Missing

Reuters, London, 13th – It is reported that famous British legless pilot Buddy is now missing. Buddy lost both legs in a flying accident ten years ago, and after fitting metal prosthetic legs, he was still able to play ball and served in the civil aviation sector. After the outbreak of the war, he argued with the physical examination department to return to the British Air Force, serving as a fighter pilot. He repeatedly led squadrons over northern France and, during the large-scale German air raids on England last year, led a Canadian squadron to fight bravely, personally destroying over fifteen enemy aircraft, and was twice awarded medals. Buddy is now thirty-one years old, ten years older than most fighter pilots. In addition, British fighter ace Luke, age twenty-one, is also reported missing. He shot down over thirty German aircraft and was twice awarded medals. In January, during a battle, his aircraft was hit, caught fire, and crashed. Luke was seriously injured and hospitalized for treatment. He was discharged from the hospital in May and is now also reported missing.

Reuters, Karachi, 13th – A vast wheat-producing area irrigated by the large Northwest Indian sluice gate project is now threatened by locusts, and the situation is serious. It is permitted that locust populations have recently increased significantly in coastal areas of the Sindh province. It is estimated that the areas with the most locusts have up to 2.5 million locusts per square mile. Most locusts have followed the wind into Sindh, and the Bikaner and Churu states to lay eggs and breed. Furthermore, locust populations have flown over southern Balochistan, India's main vegetable-producing area, and the wheat-producing area of southern Punjab. The locust populations likely came from the Arabian Peninsula, Iran, and other Western countries. Two large groups arrived in India at the end of June, and more arrived on July 15th and 20th, increasing the numbers even more.

British Peace Proposal Absolutely Absurd; Denied Simultaneously by London and Washington

Reuters, London, 13th – The rumor in the United States that Britain will negotiate peace with Germany has now been denied by London officials, who call the rumor absolutely absurd.

Portuguese Funds Unfrozen by the U.S.

Reuters, Washington, 13th – Portuguese funds in the U.S. were unfrozen yesterday. The U.S. Treasury Department issued a statement on the matter, saying that after Portugal provided appropriate guarantees to the U.S. government, the U.S. Treasury Department issued an unfrozen license. When the freezing of foreign funds was announced on June 10, President Roosevelt issued a proclamation allowing six countries, including Portugal, to be exempt from fund freezing after undertaking not to use the unfrozen funds to supply the Axis powers. Subsequently, the Soviet Union, Switzerland, Spain, and Sweden all received the treatment of exemption from fund freezing, and now the Soviet Union is also. Finland is alone to be frozen. The total amount of funds in the U.S. belonging to the Portuguese government, its banks, and its people is $160 million.

### Vichy Cabinet Reshuffle Completed; Pétain Announces Policy Direction; Striving to Advance Towards Building a "New European Order"; And Assuring America that France's Ideals Will Never Fall Behind

Havas, Vichy, 12th – The French cabinet reshuffle was completed today, adding the post of Minister of National Defense, concurrently held by Cabinet Deputy Darlan, who also concurrently serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Navy. Deputies to the Deputy Commissioner's Office, Moissard and Romier, were both promoted to cabinet members without portfolio. Marion, Secretary-General of the Information Bureau, was also promoted to Secretary-General of the Information Propaganda Bureau. Minister of Agriculture and Food Gachiwa resigned from his concurrent post as Minister of Food, and Chapin, President of the Lyon Chamber of Commerce, succeeded him. Minister of Land Hong Ziger, Minister of Aviation Bechelle, and Minister of Colonies Platon all remained in their positions. Minister of Family and Health Chevalier resigned due to illness, and Dr. Uyat, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Health, was promoted to succeed him. Therefore, the number of ministers in the French cabinet who are qualified to attend the Council of State has increased from five to eight, namely (1) Cabinet Deputy and Minister of National Defense, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Darlan, (2) Minister of Land Hong Ziger, (3) Minister of Justice Barthelemy, (4) Minister of Interior Bixu, (5) Minister of Finance and Economics Putilier, (6) Minister of Agriculture Gachiwa, (7) Cabinet Member Without Portfolio Moissard, (8) Cabinet Member Without Portfolio Romier. As for the work of the Ministry of National Defense, it includes three items: organizing national defense, demobilizing and transferring troops, and inspecting defense affairs. The Minister of the Army, the Minister of Aviation, and the Minister of Colonies are all under the control of Cabinet Deputy Darlan. The government will also issue orders to expand the powers of the Minister of the Interior, and the Ministry of National Education, Family and Health will be under his jurisdiction. Cabinet Member Without Portfolio Moissard is responsible for coordinating the various newly established agencies, and Cabinet Member Romier is the permanent representative of the Head of State in the National Consultative Council.

Havas, Vichy, 12th – Head of State Pétain delivered a radio address tonight, calling on the entire nation to unite and trust the government. Regarding foreign affairs, he emphasized that although Franco-German relations have been determined by the armistice agreement, this situation is temporary and cannot remain unchanged in the long term. As for the cooperation proposed by Head of State Hitler in October last year, it has not produced sufficient results. Regarding Franco-Italian relations, they are also based on the armistice agreement, but he still hopes to transcend this temporary measure to establish a more stable connection, because without this, it is impossible to build a "New European Order." When discussing domestic issues, the Head of State first asked the United States to understand the suffering France has suffered, emphasizing that although the parliamentary system has died, the spirit of freedom is still alive. Therefore, the United States can trust that France's traditional ideals will not decline from now on. The Head of State finally detailed the difficulties encountered domestically, believing that the biggest sources of illness are three: one is ideological confusion, two is a lack of manpower, and three is a severe shortage of goods. Fortunately, the national working class and farmers, despite working tirelessly and striving for production in extremely difficult circumstances, are France's only hope for revival. The greatest significance of this cabinet reshuffle is the appointment of Deputy Darlan as Minister of State, so that he can directly exercise authority over the national army, navy, and air force. In other words, in the future, while I will give the government considerable initiative, I will still determine extremely clear policies for certain national affairs.

Implementing a Totalitarian Political System; Political Orders Containing Twelve Points; Havas, Vichy, 2nd – Head of State Pétain announced the following twelve resolutions in a radio address to the nation today: (1) All political parties and political groups in France should immediately cease activities. All public or secret gatherings are prohibited, and the distribution of leaflets and the posting of slogans are prohibited. Violators will be dissolved and punished. (2) Starting from September 30, the salaries of all members of parliament will be canceled. (3) Officials who provide false reports to disciplinary secret societies are not allowed to be employed, as well as senior officials of those groups. (4) The Free Zone Veterans Association should be controlled by the government. (5) Expand police powers. (6) Establish a State Council responsible for supervising the implementation of central laws and removing obstacles to the country's revival. (7) Strengthen the powers of local governments. The principles announced by Head of State Pétain in Saint-Etienne, formulating mutual assistance measures between workers, artisans, technicians, and employers, will be announced soon. (8) The Economic Organization Committee will be reorganized so that all small industries can participate. (9) The organization and powers of the National Supply Office will be revised to protect the interests of consumers. (10) Head of State Pétain will use the powers granted by Article 7 of the government's organizational law to judge those responsible for ruining the country, and a political court has been organized to handle this matter. This court will submit recommendations to the permanent Head of State by October 15th. (11) All ministers and senior officials should swear allegiance to the Head of State.

Divergences Between Weygand and Darlan's Political Views; United Press, Madrid, 13th – Yesterday, well-informed sources here widely rumored that General Weygand and Admiral Darlan had sharp divergences in political views during the cabinet meeting held most recently in Vichy. These sources said that French Africa was the topic discussed at the long meeting, as Nazi Germany had reportedly made specific demands regarding the area. It is reported that General Weygand has not changed his opposition to France's position in Syria, where France allowed German troops to enter Syria in opposition to the British occupation. General Weygand insisted that France could only cooperate with Germany to a minimum extent. Insiders say General Weygand also criticized the government's attitude towards French Vietnam, allowing Japanese troops to occupy the French territory in the Far East.

Tass, Bern, 13th – Regarding Germany's ultimatum to the Vichy government, it is said here that the dictator of the current Vichy government, Admiral Darlan, absolutely supports an alliance with Germany. Darlan's actions completely follow the will of the German side, but this action has aroused opposition from many quarters. Weygand is actively resisting Darlan within the government.

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 12th – According to diplomatic sources here, General Weygand, the French government's representative in North Africa, immediately met with General Nogues, the Governor-General of Morocco, after returning to Algiers from Vichy.

The United States Closely Monitors Developments in the Vichy Political Situation

American United Press, Washington, 13th

Secretary of State Hull announced last night that the United States government is currently watching the changes in the Vichy government with interest. Darlan has become the commander of the French armed forces under these changes. He said that it is too early to comment on the impact of the changes in Vichy on the already tense Franco-American relations. When asked if Germany's acquisition of Dakar would lead to a break in U.S.-French relations, he said that this issue would be studied when it occurred. Some officials here believe that Darlan's assumption of supreme power is an increase in Franco-German cooperation in Africa. Regarding reports that Japan is concerned about the transportation of U.S. war materials to the Soviet Union from Vladivostok, Hull declined to comment.

Reuters, Washington, 13th – Former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee George told reporters yesterday that the United States will quickly realize the need to seize military strongholds such as Martinique Island to prevent German interference in the dominion over French territories in the Western Hemisphere.

U.S. and Brazil in Negotiations; Security in the Western Hemisphere Plans to Build Air Force Bases

Reuters, New York, 13th – According to sources in Washington, the United States is currently negotiating with Brazil on air force bases to eliminate any German threat to Dakar to ensure the security of the Western Hemisphere. According to well-informed members of Congress, the State Department has begun discussing with Brazil to promote its control over the Italian flying port near Natal.

### American and British Leaders to Meet on a Ship; Because Reporters Refused to Accompany, President Roosevelt's Whereabouts Unknown

United Press, Washington, 12th – Yesterday, it was reported that the President's special train was already on the way to the Maine coast, and it is widely believed that it was to welcome President Roosevelt back to Beijing. The speculation around the world about the meeting between the President and British Prime Minister Churchill will be fully clarified. Since Saturday, there has been no news from the yacht "Potomac", which is probably still continuing its voyage in the North Atlantic. Last week, the Navy Department could receive daily news from the yacht, but it did not clearly mention whether the President was on board. This is the first time since President Roosevelt left New England on August 3 that reporters have been refused permission to accompany him. Therefore, rumors all believe that the President will meet with Churchill on a warship. Senior officials in Washington and London neither deny nor confirm the meeting, so it is widely believed that the meeting is highly likely. According to a British official, Hopkins (currently unknown where he is in Britain) is with Churchill, so it is widely believed that Hopkins will also attend the talks. In addition, what is even more speculative is that the whereabouts of the "Potomac", according to Navy Secretary Knox and White House Secretary O'Leary, can be regarded as a secret naval event.

European War Talk (7) (5)

### A Scene of the British and German Naval Battle in the North Atlantic

The latter is based on the experience of the last war, and is precisely made with the latest technology. It not only has the advantages of the former, but also has a strong iron armor made of alloy metal. The characteristics of the two ships are roughly as follows.

The most noteworthy of these is the wide beam of the "Bismarck", which is unmatched by any battleship, indicating that its bottom has a dense protective shell that is not easily penetrated. Each part of the ship has an interval, and a shell hitting one part is not enough to affect other parts. Secondly, the solid armor of the "Bismarck" is also a characteristic. Historically, German-made warships with strange styles often exceeded everything in combat power. Recalling the last war, the British and German navies had an unprecedented naval battle near Jutland Island. In this battle, 14 British ships and 11 German ships were sunk. The three British giant battlecruisers "Mary Queen", "Indomitable", and "Invincible" were all sunk by German cannons, just like the loss of the "Hot". The British Admiralty explained the sinking of the "Hot" by saying that the ammunition depot "unfortunately hit a shell". In fact, the protective iron plate of the turret was too thin, causing it to be penetrated by enemy shells, the ammunition in the turret caught fire, and eventually extended to the ammunition depot at the bottom.

In short, the strength of the "Bismarck" is unmatched in ancient and modern times. The ship was hit by seven torpedoes and hundreds of large and small shells, but it still stood still. The fire on the ship was extinguished several times, and the roar of the cannons only stopped at the moment before it sank.

In summary, the British Navy's sinking of the "Bismarck" was entirely due to the close cooperation of the Air Force. The Air Force has two functions: one is reconnaissance, and the other is to launch air torpedoes. First, let's talk about reconnaissance. The British Navy has many new reconnaissance aircraft, most of which are made in the United States. The Catalina, manufactured by the American United Aircraft Factory, has a wingspan of 104 feet, weighs 27,080 pounds, can fly continuously for 4,000 miles, and stay in the air for 24 hours. It is as fast as lightning on the sea. The actions of any enemy ship cannot escape its sight. If the "Bismarck" had this new type of reconnaissance aircraft as a guide, it would not have been trapped in an encirclement.

As for air torpedoes, they are the latest invention of sharp weapons. It can hit the side of the enemy ship, which is completely different from the vertical bombing of ordinary bombs. Air torpedoes were invented in 1912, and appeared once during the last European War, but were not fully utilized. It was not until before the outbreak of this European War that the British Navy and Air Force were fully equipped with torpedo-launching aircraft. They have successively assisted in the battle on the Norwegian sea and the Italian port of Taranto, with outstanding achievements. In the Battle of Matapan, the British Navy sank two Italian cruisers and severely damaged one capital ship, also due to the skillful use of air torpedoes.

The design of the fish-thin aircraft is very peculiar. The plane is equipped with biplanes and is covered in wires. The aircraft pilot gave it a nickname, called "Wireman." The "Wireman" hangs a torpedo and discovers an enemy ship within 500 yards, and launches the torpedo 20 feet from the water surface. At the same time, it releases smoke to protect itself.

The new air torpedo is 18 inches in diameter, slightly smaller than the 21-inch submarine torpedo. It weighs 1,760 pounds. The destructive power is extremely high, and cruisers have no chance of survival. Even the most powerful battleship cannot escape serious damage.

It was a major mistake for Germany and Italy not to think of using air torpedoes in combat. The United Kingdom has this new type of weapon, and its maritime power has been greatly enhanced.

### American Military Has Sufficient Preparations, Enough to Cope with Far East Incidents. Japan Urgently Needs Rest, No Longer Has the Strength to Advance South. American Ships Between Shanghai and Hong Kong Will Not Be Obstructed

American Consul General in Hong Kong Gives Interview to Shanghai Reporters

The President Coolidge, a ship of the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai at 6 PM this Tuesday, sailing from Manila and Hong Kong. It was scheduled to dock in Shanghai before sailing directly to its home country, San Francisco, this morning. Mr. Shutter, the American Consul General in Hong Kong, who had taken leave to return to the United States three months prior, also traveled on the ship from San Francisco back to Hong Kong. Shortly after arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Shutter met with a reporter from the New Voice News Agency stationed in Hong Kong at his office in the HSBC Building. They spoke for thirty minutes. The reporter first inquired about his impressions from his trip to the United States and his observations on the future development of the situation in the Far East. Mr. Shutter replied as follows:

The United States is Exceptionally Concerned about the Far East. Consul General Shutter began by saying that during his stay in the United States for over three months, he had the opportunity to meet with important government officials in Washington, such as Under Secretary of State Mr. Welles. He did not meet with Secretary of State Mr. Hull because he was on leave. All important officials in Washington are deeply concerned about the situation in the Far East. He also expressed interest in Hong Kong. During his return trip to Hong Kong, he traveled directly to Hong Kong via Honolulu and did not stop at any ports in Japan.

Full Military Preparations. Regarding the situation in the Far East, Mr. Shutter stated that the situation across both oceans is increasingly tense, especially in the Far East, which is like an arrow on a bowstring, ready to be released. From what he saw during his trip to the United States, he is convinced that the United States is prepared. Everything in the United States has been completely renewed. He believes that in terms of military matters, such as the training of air force personnel and the manufacturing of air force planes, there have been astonishing developments. After a slight pause, Mr. Shutter made a bold statement, saying that due to the full development of manpower and material resources, the current strength of the American Air Force is like birds flying side by side, capable of obscuring the sun. He saw that his relatives and nephews in the United States were enlisting in the army, navy, and air force in large numbers to serve as reserves, like a rising tide. Everyone was filled with enthusiasm, taking pleasure in leaving their homes to join the military.

Needs Rest and Has No Strength for a Southern Advance. Before leaving Hong Kong to return to the United States, Mr. Shutter had said, "Japan fears the heat. The East Indies are intensely hot and the rainy season is approaching, making troop movements very inconvenient. Therefore, even if Japan wants to advance south, it will not be until after December." The reporter reiterated Mr. Shutter's statement and inquired about its continued possibility. Mr. Shutter replied that based on the various intelligence he obtained in Washington, he could form a concept, believing that Japan now needs to find an opportunity to rest. Japan has been fighting in China for a long time and feels the need to rest. Therefore, the current development of the situation in the Far East is very clear. Japan does not have the strength to invade the Dutch East Indies and Thailand. If it rashly takes action, it will regret it.

Shipping Between Shanghai and Hong Kong Will Never Be Interrupted. The reporter then asked that seven American ships were requisitioned by the U.S. Maritime Commission on June 16, and the twelve President liners that were added would soon be sent to Shanghai and Hong Kong to supplement them. In the event that the United States needs to use them for military or other reasons in the future, would the shipping routes between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila be suspended? Mr. Shutter replied that Shanghai and Hong Kong are currently one of the main transportation routes for the United States. This will never happen. All rumors are completely unfounded and should not be believed.

Japanese Spokesman Discusses Northeast Situation

Army Spokesman Colonel Akiyama of Japan spoke at a press conference yesterday (October 10th) regarding the situation on the border between the Soviet Union and Northeast China. The claims made by Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Lozovsky, that no incidents had occurred, were accurate. According to reports, Japan is currently trying to end the so-called China Incident. Its mission on the border is purely defensive. Given the current tranquility on the border, he does not suspect that a large-scale war will break out on the front lines. Any major offensive on the border must be preceded by frequent activity as a prelude. The spokesman also stated that he does not believe the rumors that the United States is sending fighter planes to the Soviet Union via the Alaskan route. However, the Japanese side is carefully monitoring Vladivostok, as it may be a distribution route for supplies and munitions that has fallen into the hands of others.

### Yesterday Marked the Fourth Anniversary of the Shanghai Battle. All Sectors Experienced a Solemn Mood. Citizens Ceased Entertainment to Commemorate the Occasion Spiritually. Tight Security Measures Maintained Good Order

Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the Shanghai Battle. People from all walks of life voluntarily observed a vegetarian diet and mourned with heavy hearts. Yesterday, the French Concession authorities temporarily closed unnecessary roads and alleys. Although traffic on the Jiangnan area's Tie Men and the Bund was not blocked, the search operations were particularly stringent. The details are recorded as follows:

Everyone Remained Silent in Mourning. People from all walks of life were limited by their circumstances and could not hold extravagant ceremonies. However, in order to express the Shanghai citizens' belief in resistance and to mourn the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves for the country, everyone voluntarily stopped entertainment and banquets. At 12 noon, everyone stood up in their respective places to silently mourn the fallen soldiers and compatriots. They also observed a vegetarian diet for one day to show that they would not forget. At the same time, they promoted thrifty disaster relief efforts.

The Concessions Implemented Exceptionally Strict Security. Since the Public Concession authorities began closing unnecessary roads and alleys on the 9th, the arrangements have been appropriate and the situation has been good. Yesterday, all necessary security measures were intensified. The French Concession police authorities began at 5 a.m. yesterday to place barbed wire on all unnecessary roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, such as Rue Chu Pao San, Rue de la Cathédrale, Rue Kichan, Rue Zikawei, Rue des Commissaires, Route Mercier, Rue Mollière, Rue Tcheng Kia Mou Kieou, both East and West streets of the Water and Fire Company, Rue du Pont de Pierre, Route Lyautey, Route de Messimy, Route Villermont, Route Songshan, Route Maréchal Joffre, Route Boire, Route Tenant de Possesse, Route Mayersky, and other non-essential roads, cutting off traffic.

Solemn Mood and Desolate Streets. All Chinese-owned theaters, Peking opera venues, Chinese-owned cinemas, drama theaters, and amusement parks in the city voluntarily closed for one day. Restaurants saw few customers as citizens stopped holding banquets. Therefore, the entire city was filled with a solemn and mournful mood, commemorating this great holiday in unison. Most citizens stayed at home, so there were fewer people on the streets than usual. Business in the shops was also calm, and the market was desolate. However, patriotic leaflets were still being found on the roads.

Continued Prevention for the Next Two Days. The Public Concession's measures began on the 9th and are scheduled to be lifted on the evening of the 15th. Therefore, prevention measures will continue to be implemented for the next two days. However, as the situation yesterday was generally good, the security situation today should be slightly eased. The number of troops stationed and the number of merchants on patrol will be slightly reduced. If no unexpected events occur, the measures will be lifted after 11 p.m. tomorrow night, or possibly after 12 a.m. tonight.

Today's Commemoration of Air Force Day by All Sectors

Today is Chinese Air Force Day. The National Comforting Association, commemorating the outstanding achievements of the Air Force officers and soldiers since the start of the War of Resistance, believes that a large-scale comforting effort should be launched to encourage morale on this great commemorative day. In view of this, the association launched a comforting movement today and sent telegrams to various provinces and cities to handle the matter according to their local circumstances.

### American Assistant of the Stabilization Fund Arrives in Shanghai to Strengthen Freezing Measures, Consulting with the Banking Sector to Collect Data, Blocking Arbitrage and Consolidating the Credit of Legal Tender

Since the Chinese government accepted the recommendations made by Mr. Fox, the American member of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, and his assistant, Dr. Taylor, based on their previous visit to Shanghai to investigate the monetary and financial situation, and requested the American and British authorities to implement a freeze on Chinese and Japanese funds starting on the 26th of last month, the Shanghai foreign exchange market has seen new developments. However, since the implementation of the freezing measures, there have been many loopholes, and the process has not been thorough, failing to truly achieve the goal of freezing. In view of this, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is urgently seeking remedies and has sent Dr. Taylor, the assistant of American member Mr. Fox, to Shanghai again to investigate the actual situation. It is learned that Dr. Taylor arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge from Hong Kong at 8 p.m. the night before and is staying at the Capital Hotel on Fuzhou Road. Yesterday, he met with responsible persons from the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, as well as responsible individuals from HSBC, Citibank, and Mercantile Bank, and economic experts, to collect information on the Shanghai foreign exchange market after the implementation of the freeze and to instruct on the implementation methods of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, in order to consolidate the credit of legal tender, maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange market, prevent speculation, block arbitrage, and effectively implement the government's established policies. It is reported that Dr. Taylor will only stay in Shanghai for one week before going to Hong Kong and then to Chongqing to report on his mission.

Strict Implementation of Fund Freezing. According to reliable sources in the banking sector, Dr. Taylor's solo trip to Shanghai this time is of greater significance than his previous mission to Shanghai with Mr. Fox. This trip is primarily aimed at investigating the actual freezing situation in the Shanghai market, so as to collect the most relevant information and prepare detailed recommendations as a reference for strengthening the foreign exchange management mechanism, so that the funds that have been frozen will not escape and can be used rationally by the state. On the other hand, it can use the most thorough methods to supply legal foreign exchange needs in order to maintain legal import and export trade. In other words, Dr. Taylor's mission to Shanghai is to study how to implement the freeze funds measures established by the United Kingdom and the United States without reservation, to help bring about and develop a favorable situation.

Fu Jiang Will Announce Detailed Measures. Wang Shijie, the spokesperson for the Chinese government and Minister of Propaganda, announced that the government is determined to stabilize the Shanghai foreign exchange market, has allocated the necessary funds, and entrusted them to the Exchange Stabilization Fund for operation, handling them according to the principles of effective management and strict prevention of Japanese arbitrage. Therefore, various parties believe that Taylor's visit must be related to this issue. Yesterday, there were rumors that the Central Bank will announce a detailed method today to manage the black market, with the intention of being implemented starting on the 15th, but this could not be confirmed.

Chinese Banks Limited to Settle Positions Within a Time Limit. Each of the Chinese commercial banks engaged in foreign exchange business, in order to comply with the order to handle the outstanding foreign exchange business bought and sold before July 26, has had each bank first calculate their positions on their own, and list detailed lists, which are sent to the Banking Association for compilation. After the settlement is clear tomorrow, the funds that should be collected and remitted are entrusted to the Central Bank to collect and remit to New York. For foreign exchange business outside of this, until the US government issues a special note, it has to be temporarily suspended, focusing only on the previous unfinished business. However, according to a New Voice News Agency reporter's inquiry to a national bank, the purchase and sale of foreign exchange for import and export merchants will be concentrated in the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China. Commercial banks may not engage in foreign exchange business again without special permission. The remittance of overseas Chinese will be handled uniformly by the Central Bank.

Additional Fees Will Be Charged for Excessive Electricity Use

Fees Exceeding 150 Times. Ready to Submit to the Bureau for Discussion.

According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to the reduction in coal supply, and in view of the urgency of the situation, decided to implement a 30% reduction in electricity consumption, and also planned to charge six times the normal rate for those who use electricity beyond the limit. After the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Concession Works Bureau reviewed the matter, it decided to implement the 30% reduction in electricity consumption, and also stipulated that those who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month will be charged six times the normal rate for the excess amount. However, after the implementation of this plan, factories and shops passed this cost on to consumers, using the excuse of increased costs to charge them an additional six times fee. Therefore, the result of restricting electricity consumption was not only ineffective, but the profits of factories and shops actually increased as a result. It is heard that the power company is now drafting new methods to charge fees on a progressive basis for those who exceed the electricity consumption limit. If the monthly electricity consumption exceeds 1,000 kilowatt-hours, if it does not exceed 20 kilowatt-hours, it will be charged six times the normal rate. Those over 20 kilowatt-hours will be charged twenty times the normal rate. Those over 100 kilowatt-hours will be charged fifty times the normal rate. It is also heard that because the recent coal reserves have been further reduced, the situation is becoming more serious. Therefore, it plans to submit the matter to the Bureau for discussion on September 3, after the Works Bureau's summer vacation ends, and present the progressive fee collection method for adoption and implementation.

British Financial Expert is Coming to Shanghai Soon

Attaching Importance to China's Monetary System

According to the English-language Financial and Commercial Weekly, which was published for the first time yesterday, Sir Otto Niemeyer, Britain's most famous financial expert, is on his way to Shanghai, or is preparing to come to Shanghai in the near future. Niemeyer is a director of the Bank of England. From 1937 to 1940, he was also the chairman of the International Colonial Bank. He studied at St. Paul's School and Balliol College, Oxford, and joined the British Treasury in 1907. From 1921 to 1927, he served as the head of the Auditing Department. In addition, he has traveled around the world, undertaking important financial investigations and research work. He has served as a member and chairman of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations and a member of the British Economic Mission to Australia. Subsequently, he visited Brazil and Argentina. Niemeyer's mission to Shanghai indicates the British government's emphasis on China's monetary system and will help China solve the technical problems related to maintaining the Shanghai foreign exchange market. The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the Japanese Domei News Agency distributed a message here this morning (the 13th) that HSBC intends to withdraw all of its Far East businesses, which is easy to cause anxiety among those who are easily believe in rumors. However, reporters have learned from responsible parties that this news is completely groundless and inaccurate, and that HSBC does not intend to take any of the steps reported.

### Norwegian Consulate General and British Intelligence Agency Informed by Japanese to Relocate. German Intelligence Agency Rents Greenland Building. Hamilton House Will Also Be Sold to Japanese

After the Greenland Building at No. 2 Beijing Road was purchased by the Japanese, it is said that the Japanese have notified the tenants of the building to relocate within a time limit. According to unconfirmed reports, the entire third floor will be rented to the German intelligence agency. It is heard that the Norwegian Consulate General and the British Embassy intelligence agency at No. 28 the Bund, facing the Huangpu River, have also received relocation notices from the Japanese. There are also reports that the Hamilton House at No. 170 Jiangxi Road will be sold to the Japanese. However, responsible parties deny this. According to reliable sources, this is due to the fact that the Capital Hotel opposite the building will be sold to the Japanese. However, the hotel portion of the Hamilton House from the sixth floor upwards will indeed be converted into office space.

### American People Unanimously Sympathize with China. General Situation in Shanghai Seems Very Tense. What Li Qufei, Returning to Shanghai from the United States, Said

Mr. Li Qufei, Vice President of American International Assurance Company, recently returned to Shanghai on the President Coolidge after vacationing in the United States. According to Mr. Li's comments yesterday morning (the 13th), the entire American people unanimously sympathize with China's war against Japan. Although the American peace movement does not have much strength, it inevitably causes the people's opinions on the European war to diverge slightly, but the sympathy for China is unanimous. Expert Goes to Philippines to Oversee Freezing. He had left the United States when the US government issued a freezing order against Japan, but he believed that the American people would undoubtedly support the government's move. When the freezing order was issued, he was in Manila and had visited the office of the Commissioner of the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, with several American businessmen to inquire about what steps the order would instruct American businesses in the Far East to take. At that time, the Commissioner's Office in the Philippines was also unable to provide instructions. However, a group of experts was scheduled to arrive in Manila on August 8 from Washington on the California Clipper to determine the most effective steps to thoroughly implement the freezing order. Mr. Li concluded that he felt the situation in Shanghai was very tense.

American President Liner Schedule Not to Be Changed

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the American President Coolidge arrived in Shanghai last night (the 12th) from Manila and Hong Kong, carrying a total of 135 passengers. Notable among them was Mr. Steen, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the American President Lines.

Steen Returns to Shanghai. Mr. Steen had been away from Shanghai for seven months, spending two months in the Philippines and Hong Kong. Having completed his business, he returned to Shanghai. When a reporter asked him this morning (the 13th) about the United States' efforts in the war, Mr. Steen smiled and replied that he had been away from the United States for a long time, and what he knew and heard was now old news. As for the Philippines, there were no special events to report. When the reporter asked about the schedules of the President liners, Mr. Steen said that there were no plans to change them.

The total amount is 120 yuan and 3 jiao, which we entrust to your newspaper for the scholarship fund. We are deeply grateful for your efforts."

### Three Bombings Within Four Hours Yesterday – Two Bombs Exploded, One Person Injured – Traffic Interrupted on Shanghai-West Border

Yesterday, the city was under strict security, and bomb incidents were frequently reported. The first bomb incident occurred at approximately 7:00 AM in front of the Qingyun Silver Store.

In Front of Qingyun Silver Store At that time, in front of the Qingyun Silver Store at 685 Nanjing Road (west end of Yinghua Street), near the bus stop, someone threw a homemade bomb, which exploded with a loud bang. Because it was early in the morning, there were few pedestrians on the road, and the explosive force was very weak, so no property was damaged.

Great Western Road The second incident occurred at 8:40 AM yesterday morning in the office of a Japanese inspector at 13 Great Western Road in the western district of Shanghai. It was reported that someone had placed a bomb in the drawer of a desk and attached a chain to the side of the drawer. When the Japanese inspector went to work and opened the drawer, the chain was pulled, causing the bomb to explode suddenly. One person was injured on the spot. The area was immediately sealed off, and the Japanese military police dispatched soldiers to guard key intersections to inspect pedestrians and vehicles. Traffic on the Shanghai-West border was not restored until 10:31 AM. At that time, public buses on various routes in the Public Concession, such as Route 1, Route 9, Route 2, and Route 14, terminated at Jing'an Temple, and Route 10 terminated at Connaught Road, temporarily suspending westward travel.

Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory The third bomb incident occurred at 11:00 AM in front of the Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory at 3, Lane 28, North Wuxi Road, in the Public Concession. Fortunately, it did not explode. After it was discovered, it was reported to the police station for disposal. The bomb was a hand grenade. The main factory of Hengfeng is located at 380 Ma Lang Road in the French Concession, and its scale is quite large. The reason for the bombing is unknown. In addition, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, in Datong Town, a young man named Guo, Yongfang, from Jiangbei, who made a living by scavenging, picked up a bomb. Not recognizing it as a dangerous object, he curiously struck it, and the bomb suddenly exploded, directly hitting Guo and injuring both hands. He was discovered by others and sent to Renji Hospital in Shanghai for treatment.

Stabbed with a Knife Entering the Concession Through the Iron Gate

Su Yunshan, a local resident, 33 years old, runs a rice store at 57 Lagner Road in the French Concession. At around 9:00 PM last night, Su passed through the Xinkaihe iron gate from Nanshi, intending to enter the French Concession. Unexpectedly, outside the iron gate, near the lead wire wooden frame, due to the heavy traffic, the area was extremely crowded, and he was stabbed in the left ear by a Japanese soldier guarding the area. The wound was about half an inch deep, and he bled profusely. Later, he was accompanied by his younger brother to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

Special Police Officer Accidentally Fires Gun, Injuring Foot

Xie Yuren, a native of Suzhou, 28 years old, resides at 2 Albery Place, Fuli Road, French Concession. He is a special police officer of the Public Concession, badge number 923. Yesterday was the fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War, and he was assigned to serve at the Chengdu Road Police Station. At around 9:30 PM, while taking a short break in the police station, he was cleaning his service pistol when it suddenly went off. The bullet left the barrel, pierced his leather shoe, and injured the big toe of his right foot. He was then taken to Baolong Hospital by his colleagues for treatment.

Burglary Gang Broken Up, Stolen Goods Seized Awaiting Collection

At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese detectives Xu Kaitai and Ma Shaosong of the Hongkou Police Station received a tip and broke up an organized burglary ring at 17 Dent Road. Eleven suspects, including Jiang Miaolin, were arrested, and a large number of stolen goods, mainly cigarettes and rolling paper, worth several thousand yuan, were seized. They were sent to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court and requested to be detained. However, the owners of the stolen goods could not be located for notification. Judge Huang Risheng questioned each of the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for a hearing on the 19th. In the meantime, the Hongkou Police Station hopes that the owners of the stolen goods will quickly go to the police station to inquire with detectives Xu and Ma and provide proof to claim their stolen property.

### Field Visit Report on Applicants for Financial Aid (7)

The Son of an "Old Nanny"

One day after the typhoon, the water in the low-lying alleys had not yet receded. In an old alley off Hardoon Road and Annam Road, there was still water. In a family at the end of the alley, I met a fifteen-year-old primary school student who had just finished elementary school and would be in the fifth grade next semester. The fact that a fifteen-year-old child had not yet graduated from elementary school proved that he had missed school in his early years. A woman in her fifties said to me, "There's no money for school!" This was the student's mother, with gray hair, who I learned was already fifty-eight years old. The student's father had passed away early, and before his death, he had worked as a cook's assistant. Now, his fifty-eight-year-old mother is struggling to work as a servant and do odd jobs to support her son. It is truly not easy for her to have completed his primary school education. She said that she only earns five yuan a month, and tuition has now risen to over thirty yuan, which she cannot afford. The student's grades, however, are quite good.

Borrowing Usurious Loans to Do Business

In the same alley, there was another distressed young male student who would be in the sixth grade of elementary school in the second half of the year, living in a small attic room. When I went there, his father had just returned from doing business; he was a vegetable vendor. The mother was holding a baby in her arms. In this attic room, there was not even a bed; besides a table, there was only a stove for cooking. His father told me, "He stopped going to school for a semester the year before last because we couldn't afford it. Last year, we discussed with the school about paying in installments, but we still haven't paid it off, and we still owe four yuan in tuition. The day before yesterday, I borrowed twenty-four yuan at usurious interest to do business, but unfortunately, I lost money. If he doesn't go to school, what will become of this child? A teacher in the neighborhood told me that the Shen Bao newspaper is doing good deeds there; you should apply for financial aid! Sir, please help me."

A Muslim Student

This is a Muslim family's male student, living near Nanyang Overseas Chinese School. Next semester, he will be in the first year of high school. His father works as a clerk in a charitable organization, a relief society, earning sixty yuan a month, which he also has to use to feed himself. Last year, he only earned twenty-four yuan. The student's mother is gone, and his two younger sisters are living with his paternal grandmother. The student graduated from a missionary school, where tuition was completely free. When he reached junior high school, he received financial aid from a newspaper, but only for one semester. That newspaper closed down. Last semester, the school waived half of his tuition. This semester, as he enters high school, free tuition is no longer possible. Therefore, the financial aid from this newspaper is his gospel for continuing his education. Imagine how his father, with such a low salary, can afford his son's high school tuition.

Why Be So Harsh?

The other day, I wrote about a brother who earns hundreds of yuan a month but refuses to pay for his younger brother's tuition of a few dozen yuan. This student's situation is similar. The only difference is that his older brother was born to his father's first wife, while he was born to his father's second wife. What's the difference? Aren't they siblings from the same root? This student is sixteen years old and will be in the second year of high school next semester, but he is skinny and short, as if he lacks nutrition and exercise, making him even more pitiful! His grades are indeed good; he seems very intelligent and hardworking. His father passed away long ago, and his mother is blind in one eye, living a hard life in the countryside alone. He eats and sleeps at his aunt's house on Xinzha Road. His aunt is also quite old. She said, "Everyone sees that he is smart and pitiful, so we help him!" The student told me, "His older brother, born to his father's first wife, is now a chief secretary in a company. He doesn't care about his younger brother's and mother's lives, let alone tuition." I said, "We are born of the same root, so why be so harsh?" (S)

### As Soon as Financial Exchange Loosens, Buying Frenzy Begins

Since the freezing of foreign exchange, the black market in Shanghai has continued to trade freely as usual. The market fluctuates widely and changes constantly. Those who do not understand the situation mistakenly believe that the freeze is absolute. As for Chinese merchants holding foreign exchange, paying with legal tender is something that should happen after the freeze. How can those who own foreign exchange be allowed to be frozen without any remedy? However, this action by the United States seems to be a preliminary threat, not a complete freeze. Probably because it is the height of summer, a freeze is not easy. Yesterday, HSBC's 9:30 AM listing showed British currency up 0.0625 and U.S. currency up 0.125. There were no markets for French, German, or Japanese currency. The others all rose accordingly. The black market for British and U.S. exchange rates first loosened and then suddenly tightened. Sassoon sold off earlier, and gold prices suddenly rose. Importers who had settlements to make and Chinese speculators all started buying. The U.S. dollar rose from 4.96875 yuan to 4.90625 yuan, and the British pound softened from 2 shillings 953125 to 2 shillings 912875. Both eventually tightened slightly. Trading was not brisk in the morning. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Sassoon Still Selling

Since this morning's foreign exchange news, British, U.S., and Indian markets have not changed. Exchange rates for all countries: British currency up 0.0625, U.S. currency up 8 points, the rest unchanged. The Central Bank's listed rates for all currencies were unchanged. The opening bank selling price for spot British exchange was 2 shillings 953125, and the U.S. dollar was 4.96875 yuan, an increase of 0.015625 for British currency and 0.03125 for U.S. currency compared to yesterday's closing price. Sassoon came to sell August U.S. dollars at 4.96875 yuan to foreign banks. The market situation was already softening. HSBC's listed rates were higher, and the U.S. dollar also rose to 4.9375 yuan. Since the silver equalization tax was still slightly 24.25%, importers and Chinese merchants bought August currency at 4.9375 yuan. After HSBC supplied it, the small counters reduced it to 4.875 yuan at 10:20 AM, so it turned soft. The buying frenzy was slightly stronger. Later, Chinese and foreign firms supplied and sold at 4.90625 yuan, and gold prices stopped rising at around 7,100 yuan, so the market stabilized. At noon closing, both spot and September futures were British currency at 2 shillings 921875 and U.S. dollars at 4.90625 yuan, a tightening of 0.015625 for British currency and 0.03125 for U.S. currency.

### Short Covering, Gold Prices Still Firm

Yesterday, the gold market was volatile, with black market prices initially falling and then rebounding. Around the 7,100 yuan mark, the situation changed from weak to firm as news circulated that foreign exchange rates first loosened and then tightened. In addition, today is the roll-over date, and sellers will pay buyers an estimated 60-70 yuan. Amidst short covering and buying by gold dealers, securities firms, and exchange dealers, the spot price rose from 7,010 yuan to 7,110 yuan. However, sales from Shanghai-West gangs and the unloading of exchange dealers led to a bearish situation. Ultimately, the price rose by 4 yuan. Trading volume in the morning was 70,000-80,000 taels. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Off-exchange gold prices, both cash and futures, also initially fell and then rebounded. Yongfengyu bought 50 taels from Jinjin, Chengda bought 20 taels from Xindaobao, both at 8,720 yuan. Defu bought 100 taels from Faiman Yuan at 8,740 yuan, and another 20 taels each from Xintianshi and Faiman Yuan at 8,780 yuan. At noon, prices fell back to 8,750 yuan, a slight increase of 50 yuan compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold also retreated to 890 yuan, then rebounded to 895 yuan, a slight increase of 5 yuan.

### U.S. Dollar Bills Stable and Firm

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable British and U.S. dollars, with market prices holding steady. British gold bills remained unchanged, with market prices holding steady. The opening price for U.S. dollar bills was 2,025 yuan. After opening, Tongyi, Dongsheng, Hengxiangyuan, and others sold, pushing the price down to 18 yuan. United, Dagong, Xingji, and others bought, raising it to 35 yuan. The closing price at noon was 2,031 yuan, the same as yesterday. The spot rate rose to 20 yuan 7 jiao. Hong Kong dollar bills showed a strong trend, rising to 5 yuan 6 jiao in the evening market. Japanese dollar bills did not fluctuate much, remaining at 2 yuan 2 jiao 8 fen in the evening market. Korean dollar bills showed a slight upward trend, continuing to rise to 1 yuan 8 jiao 4 fen in the evening market.

### Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn Suspended, Futures Yarn Erratic

Yesterday's futures market for Golden Horse yarn fluctuated from sideways movement to sharp increases. The morning opened with a further slump in U.S. cotton and the suspension of spot yarn trading. The general mood was confused, with no basis for judgment. Therefore, major players initially took a wait-and-see approach, and the market atmosphere was quite deserted. The opening price for August futures was 1,465 yuan, September futures were 1,538 yuan, and October futures were 1,552 yuan. After the second and third rounds of trading, the market suddenly became lively. Bullish players frequently added to their positions, and speculators also jumped in. For a time, buyers flooded the market, and the trading floor was quite congested. Prices rose slowly but steadily. The closing prices at noon were 1,467.5 yuan for August futures, up 4.5 yuan; 1,546.5 yuan for September futures; and 1,559.5 yuan for October futures, each up 8.5 yuan. The afternoon trend was even stronger. Rumors circulated that fine yarn groups were actively selling and that Hong Kong players were buying. News also spread that trading volume in the Shanghai Exchange's Blue Phoenix yarn had also increased, further boosting market sentiment. Bullish players were aggressively scooping up yarn, and speculators took the opportunity to push up prices. The trading floor was buoyant with buying interest, and trading was brisk. Prices rose steadily, especially in the second round. Only at the close of trading did some long positions emerge, causing a slight retracement of 2-3 yuan. As a result, the closing price for August futures was 1,478 yuan, up 15 yuan; September futures were 1,557 yuan, up 19 yuan; and October futures were 1,569.5 yuan, up 18.5 yuan. If there are no special setbacks, some sideways movement is possible. The total trading volume for the day was 9,500 bales, an increase of 980 bales compared to the previous day. Also, as of the 12th, the total number of three-month accounts was 22,610 bales, including 5,560 bales for August, 8,760 bales for September, and 8,290 bales for October. Sellers with the largest short positions were Nos. 2, 16, 61, 24, and 67, with 3,370 bales to 910 bales each. Buyers with the largest long positions were Nos. 19, 23, 14, 22, and 58, with 1,170 bales to 720 bales each. The daily opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded below (net market prices).

Although spot yarn trading was suspended yesterday, the black market was firm. The black market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn in the morning was 1,605 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that the exchange had risen by 18-19 yuan, boosting sentiment. 10-20 bales were traded on the yarn exchange at a price of 1,625 yuan.

### Cotton Loan Case Delayed, U.S. Cotton Plummets, Local Trading Booms

Local Shanghai cotton trading saw increasing demand for spot goods. The demand for fine staple raw materials was particularly strong. Yesterday, in addition to a large number of U.S. cotton Mitering transactions, 300-400 bales of U.S. Pengjiapo and Indian cotton were also finalized. It is expected that due to strong factory demand and favorable public buying sentiment, current Shanghai inventory is low and sources are decreasing. Spot trading is expected to become more active.

The New York cotton market was affected by political news from Washington. The Smith proposal to freeze government loans for cotton was delayed, leading to speculative selling and heavy short selling by Southern players. The market continued to fall. Subsequently, a portion of reactionary buying led to a slight rise. As a result, closing prices fell by 36-42 points, depending on the quality, compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to buying by retail investors, followed by a fall due to short selling by cotton merchants and profit-taking. Subsequently, the market rose again due to buying by European exporters, but soon fell back due to large-scale profit-taking. As a result, closing prices fell by 1-6 rupees. The forecast for today's opening market is uniformly bearish, down 3.25 rupees.

### Piece Goods: 3,200 Pieces of Cloth Shipped South

The abrupt ban on cotton cloth exports the day before yesterday had the unintended effect of backfiring, and the ban was immediately lifted. The sudden and hasty nature of the situation was laughable. Since this action, shipments of piece goods to the south have been uninterrupted. Yesterday, 200 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, another 200 pieces to Singapore, and 2,800 pieces to Rangoon.

Factory Cloth prices continued to rise yesterday. Sales to Hong Kong gangs were the strongest. Sellers' prices were stable in the morning market and rose in the afternoon. Fine cloth and twill from brands such as Fugui rose by 2.5 jiao. Coarse cloth, especially the coveted Yihua 4-pound goods, rose by 5 jiao. Other grades rose by 1-2.5 jiao. Colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, serge, and other items rose by about 5 jiao. Retail sales in the local street were quiet due to the anniversary day martial law. 200 pieces were sold to fellow traders, and over 400 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, poplin, and other items were sold to Guangdong and Hong Kong agents.

Eastern Cloth: The current spot cloth market was suspended yesterday. Black market trading was slightly active, with prices generally rising by 5-7 jiao. Cotton cloth futures on the exchange rose by about 8 jiao across all months.

### Miscellaneous Grains: 40,000 Bags of Rangoon Rice Newly Arrived, Trading Active

Sources of foreign rice continue to arrive one after another, and this has been reported in this newspaper. The Thai Shengli Company-managed Thai merchant ship S.S. Suriyothai arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with 40,000 bags of foreign rice from Rangoon and docked at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, rice, miscellaneous grains, and oil cakes were all closed for the "August 13th" anniversary.

Yesterday's imports also included 1,363 bags of raw peanuts from Yantai and 610 bags of soybeans from Tianjin.

Today's exports include 460 bags of soybeans to Hong Kong and 3,325 bags to Singapore, as well as 1,000 pieces of soybean cake to Hong Kong and 620 pieces to Singapore.

### Silk and Tea: Over 10 Bags of Huzhou Silk Shipped to the U.S.

Shipments of Huzhou silk to the U.S. have been gradually decreasing recently. The Coolidge President steamer, departing today (14th), will export over 20 bags of Huzhou silk to the U.S.

Also, today 18 pieces of tea will be shipped to Hong Kong and another 88 pieces to Singapore.

Yesterday, 764 pieces of tobacco and 28 pieces of cattle bones were shipped from Tianjin.

### Hardware: Steel Bars, Nails - Prices All See Gains

Deformed Steel Bars: Commonly known as cement reinforcement, a raw material for the construction industry. Business from out-of-town customers is naturally insignificant after the customs ban on exports. Recently, a certain organization suddenly purchased them, and the city's inventory was not abundant. After this sweep, the market atmosphere immediately became lively, and the industry's sentiment became firm. Standard selling prices rose sharply by over 100 yuan. Yesterday's quoted prices were around 3,300 yuan per ton for 3/8 and 1/2 inch sizes and around 3,250 yuan for 5/8 to 1 inch sizes.

Domestic Iron Nails: After the sharp drop in domestic iron nail prices some time ago, the market felt deserted, and the industry's sentiment was difficult to revive. However, recently, due to the lack of arriving goods from overseas and active local trading, the industry's sentiment has improved, and prices have become lively again. Yesterday, the price per barrel was quoted at 190 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Large Dried Longans Continue to Rise

Large Dried Longans: Cold-stored goods have not yet been released from the warehouse, and some old goods have arrived. Prices for ordinary grades rose by 20 yuan in the previous round, and yesterday they rose again by 5 yuan. Higher quality goods with a reddish color rose by as much as 15 yuan. As for the cold-stored goods, the sellers are quoting a price increase of 50 yuan, but there have been no transactions.

### Miscellaneous Items: Cigarettes Soar

From 160 Yuan to 60 Yuan

Cigarettes continue to rise sharply. The factory has suddenly stopped distributing goods to the industry on a scheduled basis, due to tight foreign exchange and a gradual shortage of raw materials. Sales are strong, and everyone is searching for goods with all their might. Holders are raising prices and selling sparingly. The market feels a shortage of current inventory, so the market becomes tighter and prices soar. Yesterday, the price of Old Knife brand rose to 1,135 yuan per case, a sharp increase of 160 yuan. Da Ying brand was 1,875 yuan, Wu Hua brand was 960 yuan, Pin Hai brand was 1,260 yuan, and Little Fairy brand was 1,080 yuan, all up 100-60 yuan. Golden Mouse brand was 650 yuan per medium case, and Beauty brand was 955 yuan per medium case. Looking at the overall market sentiment, it still looks promising.

### Securities: Wide Industry Shares Trading Briskly

Yesterday, the public stock market in the industry continued to be active. Wide Industry shares were the most actively traded, soaring from an opening price of 19.7 yuan to 21 yuan. The market retreated slightly at the close. Rubber stocks were stable and firm, similar to industrial stocks.

### Ministry of Education Selects Outstanding Students from Colleges and Above: Regulations Issued to All Schools for Reporting

(Chongqing Airmail) In order to reward students with outstanding academic performance, moral character, and physical education from colleges and universities, the Ministry of Education has promulgated the "Regulations for Selecting Students with Outstanding Academic Performance, Moral Character, and Physical Education from Colleges and Universities." The contents of the order are recorded below:

Regarding the "Measures for Evaluating Academic Performance in Colleges and Universities," the Ministry has already circulated and implemented them. To reward students with excellent academic performance, the "Academic Competition Measures" were formulated and circulated for compliance starting in the 29th year of the Republic (1940). Since their implementation, they have been effective. However, these competitions are limited to assessing academic performance and do not include moral character and physical education. The current educational policy emphasizes the equal importance of intellectual, moral, and physical education. Students who excel in all three areas should be given honorary rewards to encourage them. This task has been included as one of the Ministry's implementation plans for this year. Therefore, the "Measures for Selecting Students with Outstanding Academic Performance, Moral Character, and Physical Education from Colleges and Universities" are specifically formulated as follows:

(1) Each school selects students with outstanding academic performance, moral character, and physical education. Universities are limited to three students, while independent colleges and vocational schools are limited to one student each. It is better to have none than to select carelessly. (2) Students selected by each school should be those with the best average academic performance, moral character, and physical education (if physical education is included in the graduation grade, it should be calculated separately). In accordance with the provisions of the preceding article, the number of selected students should be doubled to compile a list for submission to the Ministry for review and final selection. (3) When the average academic performance, moral character, and physical education of students selected by each school are the same, the decision shall be made by voting at a faculty meeting. (4) Students selected by each school must be formal students of the school. (5) Each school must submit the list of selected students to the Ministry before the end of September of this year (the list should include the student's name, gender, age, place of origin, department, major, and grade level, admission qualifications, date of approval and relevant documents, average academic performance for each semester, moral character grade, average physical education grade, and the school's comments on the student). (6) After the students selected by each school have been finalized by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry will announce their names, issue honorary certificates, and record them in the list of honorary students. The above measures concern the honorary awards for students and must be handled carefully and reported to the Ministry for review by the deadline, in addition to being circulated to all relevant parties. This is the order.

### What's the Point of Girls Studying!

— Jiang Hong

Although it is already the 1940s, there are still many parents who think, "What's the point of girls studying?"

This, of course, is temporarily putting aside those who cannot go to school due to family economic circumstances. In families with relatively affluent economic situations, there are still many people who think that it is useless for girls to study.

We cannot deny that part of the reality is indeed like this. Some girls who come out of universities, after becoming young mistresses, live in pampered comfort, throw away their books, and indulge in mahjong all day long. Their contribution to the family is far less than that of women who come out of primary and secondary schools or even those who have not received education. Thus, the "theory that women's education is useless" arises. However, we cannot fail to admit that this is only part of the situation, and we must also look at people and the environment, and cannot generalize.

On the other hand, the Chinese tradition of valuing men over women for thousands of years and the idea that "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue" are also a major reason, but everyone understands that this is unreasonable.

Chinese women still cannot escape the circle of the family, women's occupations have not yet been popularized, and the education they receive has not been fully tailored to practical use. This is also the reality. This can be said to be a very important social reason, but it cannot be solved overnight and requires the efforts of the whole society to gradually improve.

Still others think that "girls always belong to someone else's family," so "what good does more education do for me?" This shortsighted, selfish, and self-interested thinking is quite common and is the most unacceptable.

We must regard children as the property of society. Educating children is not for personal gain, but for the sake of the children and the future of society as a whole.

### Hong Kong's "One Bowl of Rice Movement"

— Yan Qi

Sun Yat-sen's wife and Mrs. Situ Yongjue and others of the League to Defend China launched a "One Bowl of Rice Movement" to raise funds to assist the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives in establishing various factory funds in the Northwest to save wounded soldiers and refugees in our country, complete "work relief," and increase production capacity. After three months of preparation, it was held on a large scale from August 1st to 3rd.

The method of this one bowl of rice movement is as follows: The restaurants, eateries, and teahouses in Hong Kong specially make a kind of "patriotic fried rice" and donate it completely free of charge. The number of donations ranges from 500 to 2,000 bowls. In addition, various civic groups recognize and sell meal tickets, each priced at two Hong Kong dollars. Ticket holders can go to any restaurant, eatery, or teahouse that donates fried rice to eat a bowl of "patriotic fried rice."

August 1st was the first day of the launch, and it yielded a rich harvest.

Slogans and pictures publicizing the significance of this movement were hung on the tails of buses, on the sides of trams, on the walls of entertainment venues, and at the entrances of food stores on the morning of the 1st. Many men and women who were persuading people to buy meal tickets, sweating, tirelessly searched for buyers in the strange weather of one rain and one sun. It is worth mentioning that a wealthy overseas Chinese, whose name is unknown, bought a meal ticket for a thousand dollars and went to a small restaurant to eat that bowl of "patriotic fried rice." In the first-class "Ying Jing Restaurant" in Hong Kong, two British friends excitedly exchanged meal tickets for fried rice. They were not used to chopsticks, so they used spoons and ate very happily. After they finished eating, they wiped their mouths. "Did you come here to get full?" No, of course not! Before this bowl of rice are the faces of tens of thousands of victims who have no food to eat, no place to live, and are wandering in hunger. So: "Let us eat this memorable bowl of fried rice, it is our glory!"

One "Le Xian Restaurant" decorated its gate and hung a horizontal plaque with the words "Gate of Patriotism" written on it; from noon, many kinds of men and women walked into the "Gate of Patriotism," carrying the fervor of remembering their motherland to eat that bowl of "patriotic rice."

Regarding the fried rice itself, the ingredients are very meaningful. A piece of bitter melon is placed on top, followed by pickled vegetables and spicy eggplant, and a piece of "beef tongue" at the bottom of the bowl (this is beef tongue, called "beef tongue" by Cantonese). The meaning is: when our country's war of resistance began, we had to endure a lot of hardships, and we had to go through the tempering of sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy before finally achieving "final victory." (The "tongue" of beef tongue is homophonous with the "profit" of victory).

A total of 20,000 meal tickets were issued this time, with the aim of raising 40,000 yuan. Just as American aid groups were advocating a one-bowl-of-rice movement, this move in Hong Kong was even more meaningful. The money is used for "work relief," which is more proactive than general charity. Therefore, a small food stall merchant said with a smile to others: "I bought five meal tickets for ten yuan and took my wife and children to eat. This bowl of fried rice is more delicious than anything else, because I feel honored, I feel that this bowl of patriotic rice is already "victory rice!" (Sent from Hong Kong on August 2)

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Eleven Midnight Song

A classmate who was a few years older than her said with a very envious look:

"I have loved listening to opera since I was a child. If I were as handsome as you and had been studying until now, I would probably be the second Xin Yanqiu, right? At least it's better than going to elementary school to play the Monkey King in the future!" Therefore, Mei Bao finally regarded learning opera, which she had been hiding from her father, as a very promising plan. She thought that as long as she could become famous, she would definitely be able to make her father turn his anger into joy, and those harsh conditions that Shang Lao Er had forced her to agree to would not be difficult to revise, or even overturn, with the help of her father and others, as long as her conscience allowed it!

Since she had this idea in her mind, she naturally studied opera even more diligently. On Sundays, she always hid in Liu's house and followed Shang Lao Er to recite lines and practice postures; so that by the end of the first semester, she was only able to make up for the lessons she had not studied in school, barely passing the exam, which made Principal Fang and the teachers feel very strange, thinking that even if a student as smart and hardworking as Wu Meiying missed two months of classes, how could her grades be so bad?

But Mei Bao herself was very clear, so when she went back this winter, she simply did not dare to give that grade report to Begonia.

"The teacher said that I haven't made up all the classes I missed this semester, so they won't let me take the exam with everyone;" she had no choice but to recite the lie she had prepared in advance. "The report card will be given together in the next semester, but graduation is not a problem." Begonia smiled and nodded, then turned her face and jokingly asked a person sitting next to the coal stove with a burning face.

"Second Brother, do you think that a person as childish as Mei Bao can go to elementary school to be a teacher next year?" (184)

War

### Aircraft Signal Lights

— Ke Zhong

In modern warfare, aircraft have become the most important military equipment. At the beginning of the war, aircraft in groups of three or five would attack the enemy. When aircraft fly in formation, they often organize teams, with the lead aircraft directing the action. However, the method of issuing orders is often unknown to outsiders. The aircraft are equipped with signal lights, which flash on and off to transmit orders. This type of signal light is more flexible to use than radio, as it makes it impossible for the enemy to detect the aircraft's location.

### The Causes of "Mother Nightmares"

— Ji Gu

I read an autobiography in this magazine of a lady with high cheekbones, who said that her fiancé died after they were engaged. Because her cheekbones were slightly high, people cited the superstitious saying "A woman with high cheekbones kills her husband without a knife," causing her to be innocently accused of killing her husband, and she had to be a "window watcher" for ten years, and maybe be a virgin forever! Ha! In this day and age of the 1940s, there are still many people who believe in this kind of ignorant superstitious talk, which is really embarrassing for us Chinese!

At first, I thought that those who believed in this superstitious talk were always those uneducated vulgar people. I didn't quite believe what the lady with high cheekbones said - classmates with a university education also used this sentence to talk about her behind her back. But today, I saw the following on the "tail of the newspaper" of a newspaper: '"The mother-in-law's cheekbones are high, killing her husband without a knife!" This physiognomy contains strange verification. Women with high cheekbones are mostly fierce and harm their husbands. It is not necessarily a "murder of husband" blood case? In daily life, women take control of men in the family, oppress their husbands everywhere, are arrogant, and treat their husbands like slaves. If they disagree, they cry, make noise, and fight, and the family is not peaceful. If you marry such a "mother nightmare" into the house, you will have to seek a divorce, and it will be difficult to sleep and eat.' People who can move a pen are probably from the "knowledge class," right? But they actually said this kind of thing, and said it with such certainty!

I think that some women with high cheekbones may indeed be "mother nightmares," but I absolutely do not believe that they are born that way. The reason why they are like this is a psychological reaction. Because people have this superstitious idea, they always have a sense of dislike and contempt for women with high cheekbones and avoid and ignore them. They are discriminated against by their parents, relatives, and friends, and cannot get people's love and sympathy. They naturally feel the coldness of the world, which makes their personalities change and develops their emotions and suspicious personalities. They are neurotic and often suspect that people are despising and厭厭ing them, and conflicts between husband and wife often break out because of this! Therefore, women with high cheekbones are not born "mother nightmares." It is the result of the superstitious saying "Women with high cheekbones kill people without a knife" that makes them become "mother nightmares."

There are many men with high cheekbones too! But I haven't heard anyone say "Men with high cheekbones kill their wives without a knife"! It is not difficult to understand why: until today, this society is still a male-centered society. (Moved to help with school)

Editor's Note: The reasons for the formation of "mother nightmares" mentioned by Ms. Ji Gu are certainly not without some reason, but in fact, are all women with high cheekbones "mother nightmares"? Are all the so-called "mother nightmares" in the world women with high cheekbones? And everyone has cheekbones, so how is it considered high, and how is it considered low? There is no standard at all. Before these simple questions are resolved, before this unscientific assumption is confirmed, an intellectual with a mature mind should not casually believe it.

Entertainment World

### The Significance of the Theater Association

— Xu Zhongyong

I think that people in Shanghai can always hear common criticisms of Shanghai. Summarizing these criticisms, they are nothing more than envy and curses. Some say, "Shanghai is truly a blessed land. Look at other places, people are fleeing from disasters, starving to death. Shanghai, on the other hand, not only hasn't suffered from cannons and bombs within the special zone, but is even more prosperous than before the war." Others say, "The national crisis has deepened to such an extent, yet the people of Shanghai are still indulging in a life of extravagance and pleasure, as if they have no souls." Which of these two views is more meaningful, I, a corrupt person, dare not criticize. However, advocating for wholesome entertainment, I think, is still a meaningful thing. But what entertainment is wholesome? Of course, there are many, and amateur theatricals are one of them. In one's spare time, going to the theater to hum a few Peking Opera tunes, learning a few excerpts from local operas, isn't that very interesting? This isn't my bias; in fact, amateur theatricals are more meaningful and interesting than other illegitimate forms of entertainment.

Speaking of theaters, they have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain since the war, thriving vigorously. It is estimated that there are more than 300 registered and unregistered theaters, truly a good phenomenon for the theater world. However, each operates independently, with little contact, let alone mutual assistance. Isn't this a regrettable thing! I think that unity brings strength, while division brings weakness. If everyone could unite and organize an association, it would definitely benefit each theater and create glorious achievements for the theater world. Without mentioning anything else, just from my limited perspective, there are the following benefits:

(1) Adjusting Teachers Each theater has its own teachers. Although most teachers are old actors with rich theatrical knowledge and can handle all kinds of plays, this is indeed the majority. However, it's hard to say that there are absolutely none who are strong in one area and weak in another. Then, the association could make adjustments separately, either by exchanging or transferring teachers, using their strengths to compensate for others' weaknesses. Using the original amount of teachers' funding to obtain guidance from various teachers, I think it would be beneficial and harmless to everyone.

(2) Facilitating Rehearsals Every theater faces difficulties in terms of venues, sets, and costumes when it comes to rehearsals. Even if there are ways to solve these problems, the expenses and effort involved are significant. If we gather the strength of everyone to handle venues and costumes, and let the association manage leasing and renting, it would not only be convenient, but I think it would also save a lot of money. If we have the strength to independently raise funds and build an association hall to serve as a venue, that would be truly excellent.

(3) Group Research If we stipulate that group research meetings are held once a week, this week gathering those studying "male" roles, and next week gathering those studying "female roles", taking turns to the association for research, observing and learning from each other, and then receiving sincere guidance from the teachers, progress will definitely accelerate.

(4) Publishing Publications The association could collect various anecdotes from the theater world, "theatrical arts", and "play scripts", and publish them for the members of each theater to read.

Other public welfare undertakings, such as sports, literature and art, and everything else, are too numerous to mention. Fortunately, there are many senior and virtuous figures in the theater world, so I don't need to put on a show of merit here. This time, Ju Ju Chan, Xu Heizhen, Zhang Ruihong and others initiated the formation of a theater association. I hope that it can be completed soon, so I am not shy about my ignorance and come here to wave the flag and cheer.

Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

### The Zhang-Liang Dispute

— Fengwei

The martial arts actor Liang Huichao, since following Xun Huisheng's troupe south, was assigned to Gengxin. After the term expired, he was retained by his adoptive father, Dong Zhaobin, to join Zhang Yipeng's "New Journey to the West" as a way to strengthen the cast. Liang was particularly skilled in waist and leg techniques and was well received by the general audience.

However, Huichao, having learned new plays in the north, inevitably had some biases. Although his billing was lower than Yipeng's, he wanted to be on equal footing and was unwilling to submit, giving the impression of a guest trying to outshine the host. As a result, conflicts arose from time to time.

Huichao's martial arts skills were not bad, but his acting was inferior and not highly regarded. Therefore, in "Journey to the West", he only had one fight scene. However, he was ambitious and determined to compete with Zhang Yipeng, who held a leading position. Therefore, in the five-part "Journey to the West," he and the Monkey King both performed with staffs.

Yipeng was very dissatisfied with this and demanded that Gengxin's management stop Huichao from using the staff. The management also believed that Huichao's action was inappropriate in terms of both sentiment and reason, so they ordered Huichao to use other weapons. However, Huichao was very resentful and refused to accept the order. After repeated mediation by the backstage manager, there was no result. Gengxin's management believed that Huichao's lack of sincerity in cooperation not only hindered the overall situation but also easily affected business, so they ordered Huichao to stop performing from the night show on the 12th. The Zhang-Liang dispute finally came to an end.

### Blood Rain and Beautiful Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan's Nickname, Petite Silk

However, the people accompanying him thought that the father-in-law of the emperor was a noble person and must be taken care of in every way, so that nothing could go wrong. If he were allowed to stay outside, it would not be very safe, and if there were any oversights, they would not be able to bear the responsibility. Therefore, everyone persuaded him to go back. So, this sixty-year-old man, with seven parts of drunkenness, staggered and was held by everyone, left Yuan Yuan's dressing room, and still went back by boat. Fortunately, the road from Hengtang to the city was very close and could be reached in a moment. Before leaving, he rewarded the stepmother with one hundred taels of silver, and promised Yuan Yuan to come again tomorrow. The stepmother and others thought that Yuan Yuan had served a noble person, and they were extremely fortunate. Who knew that Yuan Yuan's heart was as bitter as a lotus seed? The next day, the sky was clear. Xiyu asked someone to come in the morning, bringing several boxes of fragrant powder and some things that Yuan Yuan liked to eat, as well as a book of collected doubts, to give to Yuan Yuan. When he met Yuan Yuan, he didn't know what had happened last night. He said that yesterday, because it was raining, relatives came to the house, which prevented him from coming. He asked Yuan Yuan if there were any other guests. Yuan Yuan told him about Tian Hongyu's visit, and a look of sorrow appeared on her delicate face. The lyricist was also very hesitant in his heart, because he had also heard about Tian Hongyu's visit to Suzhou to sweep the tombs. He knew that the father-in-law of the emperor, although old, was a lustful person. When he saw Yuan Yuan, such a natural beauty, how could he not be moved? Moreover, there was a flower butterfly inside, so this matter was very embarrassing. Therefore, he was silent for a long time and had nothing to say. Yuan Yuan looked around and saw that there was no one around, so she said to him in a low voice, "I think the flower butterfly is not to be worried about. What I am worried about is that old man. He is a noble person with wealth and power. I heard that there are many female musicians in his residence. If he develops ambition for me and wants to welcome me to go, then how can I, a lonely and weak person, refuse? The stepmother only wants money. Once she has gold in her hands, she doesn't care about Zhang San or Li Si. My heart is really uneasy. Who can I tell? If you hadn't come today, I would have asked someone to invite you. What do you think? If you have a way, then I will be comforted. (141)

### The Greater Shanghai Theatre Retains Its Original Name

— Lei

The Greater Shanghai Theatre will be showing domestic films after it changes hands and is scheduled to open next month. The theatre name was initially decided to be changed to "Xinhua," because it will feature productions from Xinhua Film Studio as its mainstay. It has close ties with the United Company. However, according to news received yesterday, "Greater Shanghai" will still use its old name, because once it is changed, there will be considerable trouble in carrying out various aspects. At the same time, the new owner Chu Qiaqing sent a letter from Hong Kong, thinking that "if there is no unavoidable need to change the name of Greater Shanghai, it would be better to keep it." The people in charge in Shanghai have therefore decided not to change it.

Brief News The "New Meiluoxiang" by the Jiliu Theatre Company has been scheduled to be staged at the Russian Art Academy on August 15. The role of Meiluoxiang was originally played by the red dancer Su Ni, but it has now been changed to Lu Qian. Miss Lu was invited by China Travel Service to replace Sun Jinglu in four performances, which has been highly praised by all parties. On the day of the premiere, the Jiliu Theatre News, Jiliu Song Selection, and New Meiluoxiang special page will be included with the tickets.
