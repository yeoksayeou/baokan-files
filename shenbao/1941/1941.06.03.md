### Twenty-Seven Japanese Planes Attacked Again Yesterday, British Embassy and French Consulate Suffered, British Embassy Hit by Seven Bombs with Heavy Damage, French Consulate and French Church Were Destroyed

The British Embassy buildings in Chongqing, which were painted a striking light yellow in 1929 to prevent them from becoming targets of air raids, were bombed again today. Japanese planes also bombed the western district of the city and the Jiangbei (transliteration) area, killing more than fifty people and injuring more than three hundred, the highest casualty rate this year. The British Embassy buildings, which were specially painted in a conspicuous color to make them easily recognizable by Japanese planes, unexpectedly became the best target for air raids. Since 1939, they have been bombed four times. The French Consulate and the French Church near the British Embassy also suffered damage, as Japanese planes fiercely bombed the entire consulate alley. Half of the French Consulate building has been destroyed, and the French Church has been shaken. A total of six bombs hit the British Embassy, one of which exploded and was a heavy bomb. The office of British Ambassador Kerr, the residences of embassy staff, and the house occupied by the British Embassy's Chinese Counselor, Mr. and Mrs. Blacker, were all damaged. One bomb directly hit the embassy's air-raid shelter, but no one was injured. The ambassador and embassy staff were sheltering in the ambassador's private air-raid shelter at the top of a small hill west of Chongqing. However, the ambassador's secretary, Mr. McShine, was in the embassy's air-raid shelter. He did not feel much when the bomb directly hit the air-raid shelter, but a bomb broke the embassy's main water pipe, causing a large amount of water to flow into the air-raid shelter. Today's Japanese planes launched their second attack on Chongqing in two days. Twenty-seven Japanese planes attacked. It seemed that more bombs were dropped in the city center today than yesterday. The air raid began at 10:10 a.m., but the alarm was raised at 9:20 a.m. and not lifted until 1:10 p.m. Most of the Japanese planes concentrated on the west side of the city, where shops and residences were destroyed even more severely than during yesterday's attack. It is reported that a poorly constructed air-raid shelter had its entrance directly hit by a bomb, resulting in twenty-two deaths and two injuries. The Jiangbei area north of the Jialing River was also severely bombed, with many casualties. According to the Air Defense Headquarters, the known deaths have reached twenty-two, and the injured number sixty-two, but this number is not yet complete. Since the casualties were the heaviest this year, the Air Defense Headquarters has issued a public announcement warning people not to stay outside the air-raid shelters, to avoid endangering their lives. The office of the Sino-German joint venture Eurasia Aviation Corporation was also slightly damaged by the shock. A police station was destroyed, and a Catholic hospital and a municipal hospital were also hit. The residence of the Chinese Counselor of the British Embassy suffered heavy damage. Doors and windows were blown out, and the roof and walls were pierced by shrapnel. A large bomb landed fifteen feet from the counselor's residence. About twenty bombs fell within 150 yards of the British Embassy. The embassy's main water pipe was broken, and water splashed everywhere. In 1939, the British Embassy was painted a striking yellow so that Japanese pilots could see it from the air. The British Embassy also notified the Japanese side of this special method of preventing attacks. However, since taking this step, bombs have often fallen on the British Embassy. An hour after the bombing, a United Press reporter saw the Chinese Counselor and his wife of the British Embassy happily engaged in cleaning up. The husband wiped books and lamps, while the wife swept the floor. The counselor said, "This is the fourth time this house has been hit. Fortunately, the roof was not severely damaged, so we are still safe. After going through several bombing seasons, we know we don't need much." (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)

### Preventing Foreign Aggression Dutch East Indies Strengthens Defense Recently Ordered Four Hundred Torpedo Boats Resuming Shipping to Facilitate Export of Goods

Singapore A reliable and well-informed Dutch source declared today that the Dutch East Indies is now less concerned about the threat of possible aggression than in the past, because the Dutch East Indies' defense preparations are constantly improving. The latest and best defense plan is to build four hundred motor torpedo boats. These torpedo boats are equipped with American-made aircraft motors and can travel 52 miles per hour. The Dutch side pointed out that the Dutch East Indies' shipbuilding facilities cannot build ships exceeding 15,000 tons. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies is focusing on building small ships. The Dutch East Indies has abundant materials necessary for these small ships. The Dutch East Indies' air force is also extremely powerful and has long-range bombers made in the United States. Warehouses throughout the Dutch East Indies are now full of goods that can be exported. These goods have been stagnating here due to a lack of space, but the lack of space will not last long, because the government is now repairing and re-equipping many Dutch merchant ships that have been idle in Dutch East Indies ports for a long time. The repair work is currently being actively carried out day and night in various ports that seagoing vessels can reach. The Dutch side also said that the Dutch East Indies hopes that economic negotiations with Japan will be concluded soon, but insists that supplies shipped to Japan cannot exceed pre-war levels.

Editorial

### Medical Association Holds Epidemic Prevention Movement

The Shanghai Medical Association has recently joined hands with physicians and hospitals who are enthusiastic about serving society to hold a one-month epidemic prevention movement in order to realize the ideal of immunization. It is gratifying to see this initiative at a time when the public's medical problems are most serious and difficult to solve.

The significance of this move lies not only in the physicians' sacrifice of a small portion of their time, energy, and valuable medicines, but also in the physicians' promotion of their spirit of service and morality, not focusing on their own individual medical practice, but caring about public health, and achieving the highest purpose of medicine. To prevent disease before it occurs is commendable, rather than treating it after it has developed. The general mentality knows only "to seek medical treatment in a panic when sick," but does not know the importance of daily health maintenance and the effectiveness of preventive medicine. Now that we have the advocacy of physicians, it will not only arouse public attention, but also only when physicians give instructions to patients can it penetrate people's hearts, gain unwavering trust, and be passed on from person to person without the need for coercion. Its effectiveness is self-evident and unmatched by ordinary methods. Cultivating the habit of preventing epidemics is indeed a blessing for the public. If, because of epidemic prevention injections, one indulges in sensual pleasures and gluttony, thinking that there is nothing to worry about, it is a great mistake. One must know that the onset of disease is due to a weak constitution, irregular diet, and erratic daily life, which weakens the original resistance and gives demons the opportunity to invade. Therefore, at the time of epidemic prevention injections, physicians should also deeply advise on the ways to maintain health and protect against disease. Otherwise, they will use epidemic prevention to help them harm their bodies and ruin their morals. Is this the original intention of preventing disease?

Furthermore, in the past, epidemic prevention injections were often not selective. They did not ask about the state of their body and mind, nor did they ask whether they were sick or not, but only knew to take compulsory action. As a result, there were cases of lingering in bed or even causing other diseases. Because of their unsound physiology or existing diseases, they even lost their lives. As for suppuration and erosion, it is a minor matter. How can this be said to be medical prevention or a strategy for public health? It is simply treating them like rabbits and mice, treating them like cattle and horses, and simply doing immunization experiments for them, eliminating the psychological fear of terror and plague, and seeking spiritual self-comfort. Now, the Medical Association's epidemic prevention movement "must be injected three times before a certificate is issued; a diagnosis must be made before the injection is given; a contraindication certificate must be issued to those who cannot be injected; strict disinfection must be carried out to prevent the occurrence of abscesses after the injection." The so-called "reasonable epidemic prevention injection" is worthy of its name. However, physicians are busy with their daily medical practice, and epidemic prevention injections can be entrusted to nurses. But since a diagnosis must be made before the injection, it is necessary to follow the name and verify the reality, not to be bothered by the procedure and neglect to perform it. Moreover, the voluntary action should not be shown slight neglect, nor should it be arrogant. It is necessary to make those who come feel grateful, and those who have not come feel envious. Therefore, in dealing with people, we should also show an attitude of kindness and love. Since it is called a "movement," its only goal is to have more people know and more people be immunized. Therefore, it should be publicized in many ways so that everyone has the opportunity to know. Moreover, the injection time of each physician cannot be consistent, so as to avoid enthusiastic immunizers from running around a lot. The Medical Association should issue a paper card to the physician in charge of epidemic prevention injection, and post it in the alley or outside the clinic, indicating the physician's name and injection time, as well as the start and end dates, and it does not hurt to attach texts and patterns of epidemic prevention propaganda. This can make anyone who comes for a diagnosis or passes by hear and see, and then add the power of mutual transmission to spread far and wide. The promotion will be faster. On the one hand, it is still hoped that the members of the Medical Association will actively participate, so that the whole work will be completed. This is indeed an immortal act. If the cause of benefiting the masses is carried out continuously, the public's faith in Western medicine will naturally be deeply rooted, and the indirect effect will not be slight.

However, since the prices of all commodities have soared, physicians are a free professional class. In addition, the soaring price of medicines makes the increase in medical expenses an unavoidable fact. However, the importance of medical care in life is no less than that of food and fuel, and life and death depend on it. However, the current medical expenses have been unbearable for the general wage-earning class. Even a normal delivery costs five hundred yuan, and a tonsillectomy costs a thousand gold. Although this is a very small number, it is enough to make people gasp. As for inpatient treatment, it costs thousands of gold. The expenses of each hospital are huge, and perhaps it is thought that it is not enough. Wealthy patients do not care. However, most patients often spend all their money on a single illness, leaving them bankrupt. Moreover, disease does not choose between rich and poor, and it is easier for those who work hard and have poor nutrition to get sick. Physicians are also a professional class, and they must know the hardships of the industry. How to solve the current public medical problems is also an unavoidable responsibility for the medical community today.

### U.S. Congressional Figures Welcome U.S. Cancellation of Special Privileges in China, Recognizing This as a Correct Diplomatic Action and Consistent with the President's Lend-Lease Position

Diplomatic circles in Washington yesterday considered the cancellation of consular jurisdiction in China as one of the goals of the United States' Far Eastern peace efforts. This move was warmly welcomed by Congress, which regarded it as clear evidence of the United States' policy of non-interference in the Far East. Even congressional leaders who normally do not sympathize with the government's diplomatic policies praised Secretary of State Hull's exchange of notes with Dr. Quo Tai-chi. They also lauded Hull's straightforward statement to the press that consular jurisdiction in China would be abolished as soon as peace was restored. Experts analyzing the current situation believe that Hull's statement is the first to express a correct stance on U.S. Far Eastern policy beyond the mantra of "maintaining the status quo." "Maintaining the status quo" is merely empty talk, far less powerful than taking correct action. It is also believed here that Hull's statement is related to the statement made by Foreign Minister Eden last week. It is believed by many that Eden's statement last week hinted at the basis for peace negotiations in Europe and Asia. Some people believe that if China wins, it will become a major power in East Asia, more dangerous than present-day Japan. Therefore, they are very skeptical about Hull's declaration and hope that the U.S. State Department will preserve the current commercial privileges in China. Senator Gillette of Iowa (a veteran member of the Foreign Relations Committee) declared, "The consular jurisdiction and other privileges extorted from China by Western countries have always been intolerable to China and are clearly a violation of China's sovereignty and autonomy, with no just cause. Our country has already clarified its position on upholding the four freedoms of the world. We cannot in good conscience continue to maintain privileges in China that undermine the four freedoms that our country has guaranteed. Hull's statement is certainly in line with the position announced by the President and Congress in the Lend-Lease Act. We have vowed to aid all countries defending themselves, and China is at the forefront of national self-defense. We have clearly stated our pledge to aid them." Senator Nye of Indiana, who usually opposes the government's foreign policy, stated, "This statement is sufficient to show that U.S. Far Eastern policy has no imperialistic ideas whatsoever." Congressional leaders are less interested in the news that the United States will allow army pilots and technicians to go to China. The State Department denies that it has made preparations with the Chinese government for pilots to go to China. However, there seem to be many signs here that prove that the Army Department is acting independently and is not rejecting resignations of this nature. The number of people reporting to help China seems to be increasing. (United Press, 2nd)

### Japanese Ships Still Able to Export Iron from the Philippines

A reliable report published in Manila today states that U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, has approved an export permit allowing the "Atlantic Maru" to export 8,200 tons of low-grade iron ore from Surigao Province in the southern Philippines. It is believed here that this move is sufficient to show that the U.S. export permit system in the Philippines will not completely cut off Japanese trade with the Philippines. Undersecretary of State Welles is scheduled to arrive here this afternoon on a clipper to assist Sayre in processing export permit applications. Also on the same plane is Fox, the U.S. representative of the Sino-American Stabilization Fund Commission. Mr. Fox is en route to Chongqing. (United Press, 2nd)

### Japanese Instructing British in Saigon to Prepare to Withdraw

A Tokyo Domei News Agency dispatch from Saigon today states that the British Consul in that city has again warned British nationals to secretly evacuate Saigon. Domei believes that this action is related to the Far Eastern crisis rumored to be engulfing Singapore. According to Domei, dozens of British Indian merchants have already sacrificed their inventory with large price reductions, and there are rumors that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in that city will suspend operations.

### Japan Relies on the Axis and Bargains with the United States; Political Commentators Urge the Government to Be Cautious with the U.S.

Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently issued a statement reiterating Japan's commitment to its obligations under the Axis alliance and denying that it is engaged in any understanding with the United States. Diplomatic figures here have interpreted this as the beginning of another diplomatic offensive by Matsuoka to place Japan in a superior position between the Axis powers and the United States, engaging in bargaining. Furthermore, the fact that Matsuoka's speech was delivered after meeting with German Ambassador to Japan General Ott is of particular significance. Since President Roosevelt of the United States delivered his speech, Germany has felt threatened in the Atlantic. It is quite possible that Ambassador Ott visited Matsuoka to request that Japan fulfill its alliance obligations in order to exert restraint. In addition, it is worth noting that Japanese newspapers have recently been promoting the idea that negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies have stalled, and that relations between the two sides are becoming increasingly strained. (Havas, 1st)

Former Chairman of the Japan Times, Ashida, recently published an article in the English-language "Contemporary Review" reviewing Japan-U.S. relations, stating that there is little doubt that the United States will enter the war this summer or autumn. If so, Japan must adopt an extremely cautious attitude. The government authorities have consistently viewed the Japan-Germany-Italy alliance treaty as intended to prevent the United States from entering the war, and this is generally supported by the entire country. However, there are still many unclear aspects of our country's foreign policy among the people, and it is hoped that the government will pay special attention to the following three matters: (1) What the entire country most earnestly hopes for is to end the "China Incident" as soon as possible. (2) The people urgently want to understand the future direction of foreign policy and want to know whether war will break out between Japan and the United States. Although Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka have made speeches on this matter, Americans still believe that Japan will follow in the footsteps of Hungary and Bulgaria in the Axis camp. This impression must be dispelled. (3) The Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact is not the final stage of mutual understanding, but only a preliminary test. (Havas, 1st)

### Japanese Newspapers Unanimously Criticize British and American Policies

Tokyo This week, Japanese newspapers have criticized British Foreign Secretary Eden's draft of British peace goals. The "Hochi Shimbun" discussed this issue, titling its article, "Eden Is Delusional; Is His Thinking Sound?" The English-language "Japan Times and Mail," which occasionally reflects the views of the Foreign Ministry, stated that Roosevelt had met with Eden before his speech, as it was certain that the U.S. government, which had provided such significant assistance to Britain, "even training aviation personnel," would inevitably participate in Britain's reconstruction process after the war. The "Hochi Shimbun" also stated that the various "freedoms" that Eden cited as the basis for peace were actually within Roosevelt's scope and were in fact issued by the President. The newspaper's editorial also stated that the facts are sufficient to prove that Britain's postwar goals are actually those advocated by Roosevelt. The United States is attempting to promote its ambition to dominate the world and oppose Germany's "New Order" within these four freedoms. It also said, "The President's words are already a little late, as Hitler has already advocated his views on the New World Order. However, in cooperation with President Churchill, British Foreign Secretary Eden expressed that what the people need more is freedom, while Chancellor Hitler believes that organization, system, and rationality are better." The newspaper claimed that Britain is attempting to re-impose the old Treaty of Versailles on Germany, the consequences of which we have already seen today. The "Hochi Shimbun" considered Eden's statement regarding the extension of the moral order to the Far East to be an "insult to Japan." As the newspaper claimed, Britain's past actions have already demonstrated that Britain is the public enemy of the Far East. The "Hochi Shimbun" also stated that the main goal of Japan's construction of a New Order in East Asia is to enable "every Eastern people to enjoy a suitable position." The newspaper also stated, "Therefore, we demand that the Anglo-Saxon countries, which have used the beautiful names of morality and humanity to drain the last drop of blood from the people of Asia, withdraw from the Far East. We should rebuild East Asia for the Asians." (United Press, 2nd)

### Lippmann Utters Another Strange Argument, Demanding Appeasement of Japan; U.S. Should Lift Immigration Restrictions on Japan to Avoid Pacific War

Washington U.S. celebrity commentator Walter Lippmann issued an article yesterday, claiming that the U.S. has now reached the point of seeking ways to avoid a Pacific war with Japan, because given the current situation in the Atlantic, a Pacific war would be detrimental to the U.S. He also claimed that if we can engage in decisive and fair actions that mutually acknowledge the essential interests of the U.S., we can avoid a Pacific war. "We are militarily prepared to prevent the Japanese from interfering in the world war, and we have already made the necessary military agreements with China, Britain, Australia, the Netherlands and India. We also hold all kinds of economic warfare tools in our hands. We can conduct genuine negotiations in the Far East based on the honorable peace that China has achieved in the war, Japan's conclusion of new commercial treaties with the Dutch East Indies and the U.S., and including the Soviet Union, to eliminate the political basis of British, Japanese, and American imperialism in China. If the Japanese side responds favorably, we should voluntarily cancel the immigration restrictions on Japan, which hurt Japanese pride, to compensate Japan's current costly war, which is solely to please Hitler. Our efforts have a very good chance of success." (United Press, 2nd)

### President Roosevelt Signs Priority Bill

New York President Roosevelt signed a bill today giving the government the power to designate private industries to have priority in manufacturing national defense products, and an addendum was added to the bill in the hope of accelerating steel production. (United Press, 2nd)

Tokyo American newspapers have recently claimed that Japan is becoming increasingly indifferent to the Tripartite Pact. The Yomiuri Shimbun refuted this today, stating that these remarks are clearly intended by President Roosevelt's cabinet to downplay Japan's position in the Pacific and prepare to move the strongest part of the Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic in order to avoid public protests. American newspapers have repeatedly stated that Japan does not want to fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact and is preparing to abandon its southward advance policy. As a result, President Roosevelt is downplaying Japan's responsibility in the Pacific under the Axis alliance in the hope of driving the U.S. closer to entering the war. The U.S. government hopes to be able to transfer its strong fleet stationed in the Pacific to the Atlantic to reinforce the 165 aging ships already there. In fact, Japan is determined to fulfill its obligations to the Axis powers, and any action to the contrary would tarnish Japan's past glorious history. (Reuters, 2nd)

### There Need Be No War in the Pacific, Observation by American Radio Commentator

Tokyo Dr. Young, a famous American radio commentator, arrived in Yokohama yesterday aboard the Japanese mail ship Haruna Maru. According to him, a war between Japan and the United States in the Pacific is an unthinkable, illogical, and impractical proposition. In short, no one wants to see this war. Dr. Young stressed that although the international situation feels tense, war will not break out in the Pacific. Of course, his position is not to speak on behalf of the U.S. government, but many prominent figures in U.S. political and financial circles feel that the United States needs to maintain friendly relations with Japan. He now plans to travel to Manchuria and various parts of China, but will not go to Chongqing. Dr. Young also said that radio can greatly improve international relations. Many Americans are now listening to Japanese broadcasts to better understand Japanese affairs. Dr. Young holds doctorates in science and literature and studied at Yale University, Cambridge University, and the Royal University of Uppsala in Sweden. He entered the broadcasting industry in 1925 and has traveled to 53 countries, meeting many monarchs, presidents, and foreign politicians. This time, he will first go to Japan and then travel to Australia and South Africa as a traveling reporter for the National Broadcasting Company of the United States. Dr. Young also said that he will try to avoid commenting on the situation in the East, as a few months of observation is not enough. He will use facts he has witnessed and information provided by reliable Japanese as broadcasting material. (Reuters, 2nd)

### U.S. Experiments with Transporting Tanks by Airplane

Washington Republican Congressman Engel recently stated here that the U.S. Army is currently experimenting with transporting tank parts by airplane, so that they can be assembled into vehicles after landing. If this method proves successful, it will be very effective in defending the countries of South America and Greenland. In addition, the United States is actively manufacturing tanks these days, and a large number of products are expected to be produced within six months, which can be used by the army to teach soldiers. It is hoped that the quantity will exceed demand. (Havas, 1st)

### End of the Crete Campaign: British Troops Retreat to Egypt; Control of the Dardanelles; Turkey Surrounded by the Axis

London: The German conquest of Crete and the British troop withdrawal, as announced by the British War Office, have been confirmed. Subsequently, the Germans will be able to advance on Cyprus, Britain's last stronghold in the eastern Mediterranean. At that point, the distance for the German air force to attack the major port of Alexandria in Egypt will be less than 400 miles. British Prime Minister Churchill had previously vowed to defend Crete to the death. The abandonment of the island is a severe blow to the British people. The fact that 15,000 overseas troops rescued from Crete are being transported to Egypt instead of Cyprus has caused considerable surprise in some quarters, as it is widely known that Hitler's next move will be to attack Cyprus. Well-informed sources emphasize the high cost of this German victory in terms of lives, machinery, and time. However, the British losses are also significant, with the number of British casualties being the highest since the Dunkirk evacuation. If the deaths of Greek soldiers are included, the casualties are proportionally the highest since the beginning of the war. The abandonment of Crete is the fifth retreat for the British army, the previous four being Norway, Dunkirk, British Somaliland, and Greece. Only Somaliland has been retaken by British forces. This retreat is undoubtedly a severe blow to Britain in the overall war effort, particularly concerning Turkey's position. It is widely known that a "struggle for oil" is about to unfold in the Near East, and the Axis powers have now surrounded Turkey. Hitler has effectively gained control of the Dardanelles Strait and now has the power to compel the Turkish President to follow his orders. Furthermore, the support of the Arab nations, on which Britain relies, is now teetering. According to recent reports, the chiefs in the Near and Middle East are adopting a cautious wait-and-see attitude towards the war, awaiting future developments. The fact that the Germans were able to conquer Crete using only airborne troops, without any naval support, has sparked speculation here. How likely is it that the British can defend Cyprus? (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

Cairo: The British navy and air force cooperated once again to successfully evacuate British and Allied troops from Crete. This evacuation was similar to the British retreat from Greece. British fighter planes repelled German dive bombers, while British warships sailed across the Mediterranean to safety. It is believed that the British War Office's announcement of the withdrawal of 15,000 troops from Crete refers only to British and British Empire forces, and does not include Greek troops who may have already been evacuated. The number of Dominion troops among the evacuated British forces is currently unknown. The total number of British troops on Crete, and whether the evacuation is complete, remain to be seen. Well-informed sources say that the urgency of the evacuation was dictated by the disparity in distance between British and German air bases and Crete. It is widely believed that at least some German prisoners of war captured on Crete have been taken to Egypt. London sources believe that New Zealand General Freyberg likely withdrew with his troops at the same time. A British air force official estimates that the Germans used approximately 1,000 aircraft in Crete, several hundred of which were destroyed. German paratroopers are not to be feared; it was not the paratroopers who captured Maleme and allowed the Germans to land, but rather German bombers and fighters. The airborne troops transported by air were the real danger, not the paratroopers. Based on opinions from Greece and Crete, low-flying fighters are far more fearsome than dive bombers. In the official's personal opinion, this war is an air war, and future battles will be even more so. While the German success in Crete has further complicated matters for Britain, no other terrain is quite like Crete. If the Germans attempt to advance further, they will encounter greater resistance and face a heavier burden. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

Berlin: This afternoon, German military reports claimed that the battle of Crete has ended. The last British naval base on the island, Sfakia, was captured by German forces yesterday. British troops who stubbornly defended the northern mountains of Sfakia, making a last stand, were overcome by German mountain troops, and 3,000 enemy soldiers were captured. The German air force assisted the army in completing the task of clearing out the remaining enemy. German aircraft attacked the British fleet, hitting a destroyer with three bombs, which eventually sank. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)

German and Italian Forces Join Up, Conduct Clearing Operations

Berlin: Well-informed sources here commented yesterday on the joint German-Italian advance on Crete, saying that this approach could be described as "separate advances, joint attack," similar to the attack on Yugoslavia. German and Italian forces have joined up at Ierapetra. After the port was occupied, the British had no way to retreat, and all attempts by the British to retreat from other locations failed. After British troops in Stenikia were bombed, several tanks caught fire. The German air force's operational range has now expanded to the coast of North Africa. A ship carrying military supplies was sunk off the south coast of Crete. The Battle of Crete can now be considered over. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)

Berlin: The German High Command announced yesterday that the final mopping-up operation on Crete "is progressing smoothly." The announcement stated that approximately 10,000 British and Greek prisoners had been taken. The announcement also stated that German bombers attacked British light warships off the south coast of Crete, and a Royal Navy destroyer was hit and severely damaged. Furthermore, three British "Hurricane" aircraft were shot down, while the Germans suffered no losses. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

Berlin: British troops withdrew from Heraklion, Crete, on May 29. Military correspondent Büchsas's account of the German paratrooper operations has been brought back to Berlin. Excerpts from the correspondent's diary are as follows: May 20: German paratroopers landed near Heraklion amidst intense anti-aircraft fire. At night, British forces bombarded the small hill occupied by the Germans with artillery. May 21: With the assistance of aircraft, German forces repeatedly attacked the airfield, destroying several British aircraft. German aircraft dropped ammunition and food in the afternoon. May 22: German forces received a large supply of ammunition, food, and medical supplies. German forces continued to strafe British troops with machine guns. The commander of the Heraklion garrison requested the Germans to surrender in the afternoon, to which the Germans responded by bombing the city. German aircraft bombed the gasoline depots at the airfield, causing a large fire. British troops attacked the German rear, killing 15, while German troops suffered two fatalities. May 24: A British Hurricane aircraft attacked German positions. German aircraft heavily bombed the city and the airfield. Transport aircraft continued to drop supplies. German patrols captured several more prisoners. May 25-27: German forces attacked the airfield with great success. Patrols engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat, capturing many prisoners. May 28: German forces received orders to attack the city of Heraklion and the airfield the following day. German forces launched a heavy attack on the city, with considerable success. May 29: Patrols reported that the British forces had withdrawn, and German forces immediately occupied the city. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)

Berlin: The German News Agency announced yesterday that German and Italian forces on Crete have linked up and now only need to clear out the remaining British and Greek forces in the center of the island, a task that should be completed in just a few days. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

The British People Expected the Unfavorable Development

London: Although the British people do not tend to underestimate the intensity of the Battle of Crete, the reaction to the campaign's course differs greatly from what the Germans expected. The entire British public is fully aware of Crete's strategic importance and the ferocity of the German attack. Moreover, a week earlier, the British knew that the British and Greek forces on Crete were in a precarious situation due to a lack of air cover. Recalling the rapid advance of Nazi troops into the Netherlands and other places, they were prepared for the worst-case scenario and knew that news of the end of the Battle of Crete might arrive any day. The fact that the battle lasted for several more days and that the well-trained and elite German forces suffered heavy casualties caused the British to admire the courage of the Allied forces and to learn various lessons from the campaign, such as the need to strengthen the protection of British airfields. The general opinion of the British people today seems to be that although British troops have withdrawn from Crete, developments in the Near East have not brought Hitler significantly closer to his ultimate goal. Hitler has been working hard to expand his soldiers and aircraft, stockpile gasoline, and order all German churches to offer special prayers for the Nazi forces on the battlefield until the end of the war. This can be seen as clear evidence of the Germans' efforts to encourage their troops and prevent morale from declining when news of heavy losses arrives. As Churchill announced a few days ago, while German dive bombers have had some success in attacking British ships, there is absolutely no question that the British navy's position in the Mediterranean has been damaged. Furthermore, the British have fought hard to defend Crete for so long that the situation in other key centers in the Near East has turned in Britain's favor. While defending Crete, British aircraft from East Africa have been redeployed to other operations, tanks have been inspected and expanded, and the situation in Iraq has been clarified. All of this has provided the British with powerful encouragement and greatly dispelled concerns about the fate of British forces in Crete. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

Fighting Fiercely for Two Months, Spirit Undiminished

Cairo: According to wounded soldiers arriving here from Crete, the island was still under heavy fighting when British troops withdrew last Saturday. At that time, the British rearguard held strong positions in the mountains. Although enemy dive bombers and other aircraft still filled the sky, they had difficulty targeting British positions. Shortly before their departure, a village was bombed for two hours, with 300 bombs dropped, destroying everything. New Zealand General Freyberg is now confirmed to be safe and still leading his troops in battle. According to German reports, the general had been killed in action. A military spokesman in Cairo commented on the British withdrawal from the island, saying that British troops were prepared to fight to the death, but since the campaign had exceeded the value of holding the island, it was decided to withdraw. If the British had not put up such a glorious fight, the overall situation in the Middle East might have deteriorated. Although British losses on the island were significant, it is nothing short of a miracle that 15,000 men were able to withdraw safely under heavy enemy pressure. It has been learned that a British warship slipped into a port in the heart of the Middle East on May 29, carrying the first batch of weary troops away from Crete. These were New Zealand troops, who had been fighting fiercely against the Germans in Greece and Crete for two months, yet their spirit remained undiminished. Subsequently, ships loaded with other soldiers sailed away in the dark, and the sounds of bugles and soldiers cheering could be heard from afar. Nothing could break their morale. A New Zealand soldier said that the weather on the island was truly terrible, either raining or snowing, and sometimes even hailing. When they traveled day and night to the coast, they were subjected to unprecedentedly heavy attacks from specialized German forces. Many of the withdrawing troops were wounded and had only received the most basic treatment in the field. They all recounted the barbarity of the German troops. Another New Zealand soldier said that water was very scarce on the island. Soldiers lined up side by side to quench their thirst, heedless of the German dive bombers' machine gun bullets raining down. A British naval officer recounted seeing a marine commander single-handedly use the last of his anti-aircraft guns to drive off German dive bombers while standing in front of burning trees near Kania, a truly remarkable feat of bravery.

### Strong Protest to Germany After South Ireland Was Bombed; Demanding Compensation for Deaths, Injuries, and Damages; Guaranteeing No Further Violation of Airspace and Territorial Waters

Dublin: The official gazette of the South Irish government stated that the bombs that fell on Dublin on Saturday morning came from Germany. A strong protest has been lodged with the German government, demanding compensation. As a result of the bombing that morning, at least 27 people were killed, about 80 were injured, and property damage was considerable. Another bomb fell near Arklow in South Ireland on Sunday morning, but there were no fatalities, although property suffered slight damage. An investigation has revealed that all the bombs came from Germany. Therefore, the South Irish chargé d'affaires in Berlin has been instructed to protest to the German government in the strongest possible terms, objecting to the violation of South Irish territory, demanding compensation for the deaths, injuries, and property losses, and requesting a firm guarantee from the German government to issue strict orders to prevent German aircraft from flying over South Irish airspace and territorial waters. Furthermore, it was learned last night that 27 people were killed in the Dublin bombing. The search for the dead and wounded is continuing. Twenty houses were completely destroyed, 55 were severely damaged, and 300 people were made homeless. The Independent newspaper reported on Sunday that "We are confident that Mr. de Valera will visit the bombed area yesterday to express his sympathy to the victims, and then make a strong protest to the belligerent countries concerned. Since the start of the war, South Ireland has strictly adhered to neutrality and has the right to demand that any belligerent country not violate its territory and airspace." (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### Northwest of England Subjected to Heavy Bombing Again

London: A city in the northwest of England was subjected to the heaviest air raid in months last night and this morning. German aircraft repeatedly attacked in groups after dark, dropping bombs indiscriminately, causing casualties and destroying many houses in residential areas. Although air raid sirens sounded in London for three hours and the sound of gunfire was heard at times, it was not bombed. The Ministry of Home Security reported that one enemy aircraft was destroyed. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

London: London issued its first air raid warning in three weeks last night. It was heard that German aircraft also roamed over the north Midlands and northwest England last night. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd) Berlin: Last night, the German air force heavily bombed military targets and warehouses in Manchester, circling and dropping bombs for two hours. Several fires broke out, and the explosions were heard far and wide. Many ports on the south and west coasts of England were subjected to air raids. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)

Berlin: According to authoritative sources, a British aircraft was shot down over the Norwegian coast yesterday afternoon. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)

Detailed Damage from Bombing of German Territory

London: The British Air Ministry's Information Department released details of the damage suffered by Hamburg, Kiel, and Wilhelmshaven in Germany, saying that news of the terrifying power of the latest British bombs had spread throughout Germany. The German authorities then published details of the damage inflicted on London, making comparisons in the hope of reducing public panic. When Hamburg was bombed, a new type of giant bomb destroyed a factory in the Steinwarder industrial area, covering approximately 20,000 square yards. Other areas were also heavily damaged, which caused the Germans to tremble with fear. News from Germany stated that the scenes in Hamburg were heartbreaking and shocking, and that there was hardly any district in Germany's second-largest city that had not been bombed. Hamburg was repeatedly subjected to heavy bombing by British aircraft using giant bombs in May, and the details of the damage are still unknown. However, reconnaissance aircraft photographs show that 36 large factories in the area have been completely destroyed or severely damaged, and many more have suffered minor damage. After a British air raid on Mannheim on May 5, troops were deployed around the chemical factory in the Ruhrort industrial area on the outskirts of the city, and ambulances left the factory in an endless stream throughout the day. The damage to Mannheim's shipyards was also severe. Sixteen warehouses on both sides of the Feudenheim Canal were completely destroyed, and the warehouses along the Rhine were also completely burned. After a recent attack, British aircraft flew to reconnaissance the following day and still saw the embers being extinguished with water. The eastern end of a large bridge over the river had been destroyed and had fallen into the river, blocking traffic. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

British Air Force Battle Results

London: British authorities claimed yesterday that since the outbreak of the Middle East war, 1,696 Axis aircraft have been destroyed in various theaters, while British losses during the same period amounted to only 260 aircraft. The figures for Axis aircraft losses are estimated at the lowest possible limit and do not include aircraft destroyed on the ground. In May alone, the Germans lost 258 aircraft in the Middle East, while the British lost 59. The authorities also claimed that 204 German aircraft were shot down during attacks on Britain in May, while 67 British aircraft were destroyed over Europe. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

### German Motorized Troops Sneak In; Syria Declares Martial Law; Britain Will Take Strong Measures to Make it Easier to Defend Cyprus

London: According to an Ankara telegram broadcast by the Columbia Broadcasting Company, German motorized troops, carrying swift armored vehicles, have arrived in Syria aboard a coastal freighter. It is believed that these troops either took the route through the Dodecanese or snuck through the narrow passages of the Cyprus and Turkish straits at night. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

New York: Today, German radio announced that General Dentz, the Vichy commissioner in Syria, has declared martial law in northern Syria. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

Rome: The French High Commissioner today declared a state of martial law in eastern Syria and is strictly enforcing border controls. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)

Istanbul: Reliable diplomatic circles believe today that Britain will soon declare Syria to be a German-occupied area and recognize Syrian territorial waters as enemy territory due to German activities there. Some diplomatic circles believe that Britain will take stronger measures against Syria. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)

Beirut: This morning, British aircraft continued to bomb Syrian airfields. The city of Aleppo was also a major target for British air strikes. In recent days, British aircraft have dropped leaflets and publications in various cities in Syria, including a recent speech by Eden. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)

Beirut: At 11:15 this morning, several more British aircraft circled over the airfield here and were driven away by anti-aircraft fire. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 1st)

London: Commentators and military specialists in prominent London newspapers suggested today that Britain should take the initiative to attack Syria to protect Cyprus, lest it become the next battlefield. They pointed out that if Syria were in British hands, the defense of Cyprus would obviously be easier. If the Germans gain a foothold in Syria, it will be extremely difficult to defend Cyprus. Cyprus is the third-largest island in the Mediterranean, after Sicily and Sardinia. Disraeli once called it "the western part of Asia." News from Cairo states that the main condition of the British-Iraqi armistice is the implementation of the British-Iraqi Treaty, according to which British troops can enter Iraq at will, which is of considerable importance. Militarily, it is very beneficial for British troops to occupy Syria, as it would place them on the southern flank of Turkey, with a loyal Iran behind them. The military specialist of the Daily Telegraph declared, "We clearly have the strength to do this, and this possible operation would be welcomed by the majority of the French forces there. The new German threat is almost certain to come from that direction, so it should be brought under control in advance." The commentators pointed out that the Germans could use Rhodes, Cyprus, and Crete as bases to launch attacks on British oilfields in Iraq and Iran and the Suez Canal, and could use the German and Italian forces in Libya in a pincer movement to exert pressure. The British offensive triangle used to be Crete, Cyprus, and Alexandria, but with Crete occupied by the Germans, the British position has naturally deteriorated, especially as the ability to defend Cyprus has not yet been determined. British commentators seem to believe that Cyprus is easier to defend than Crete because the British have sufficient airfields there (it is said that the main reason for the failure in Crete was the lack of airfields), and because it is closer to British air bases in Palestine and Egypt and further from German bases in Greece, unlike Crete. Cyprus has the most natural airfield in the world, called Mesaoria, located in the center of the island, which is a 400,000-acre plain without a single tree that could be used as a base for attack, as well as being an ideal location for troop carriers and gliders to land. The British also have other air bases on Cyprus, namely Nicosia and Larnaca, the latter being a southeastern port city, which is important. British commentators claim that if sufficient air defenses can be established at these bases, the resulting firewall would be enough to prevent aircraft from carrying out an airborne invasion. This firewall could also provide the necessary protection for fighter planes operating from Cyprus. It is understood here that a large army is stationed in Cyprus, most of whom are Australian and New Zealand troops. The commentators also pointed out that Cyprus is 600 miles from Greece, beyond the range of dive bombers, but the island of Rhodes, which has five airfields, is only 200 miles away. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)

### Complete Cessation of Hostilities; Iraqi Regent Flies Back to the Country; British and Iraqi Dignitaries Give a Warm Welcome; New Cabinet to be Formed Soon

The Regent of Iraq arrived in the capital of Iraq by plane at 10:00 AM today. The former Prime Minister Said was also on the same flight. Government officials were all at the airfield to greet him. It is generally expected that the new cabinet will be formed tomorrow. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)

Since the British and Iraqi sides have signed a ceasefire agreement, hostilities have completely ceased. The Iraqi Regent, who fled when Ali Gailani launched the coup, returned to Baghdad yesterday. At that time, Iraqi dignitaries, the British Ambassador, and the British military mission all came to welcome him. The people gave him a warm welcome. Shortly after the Regent entered the capital, he held a reception. Guests included the American Minister, Mr. Knobloch, etc. It is heard that the young King of Iraq, Faisal (only six years old), is safe in the capital. The previous rumor that Ali Gailani had taken the King out of the country has been found to be inaccurate. It is also heard that the director of the Mosul oilfield strongly opposed Ali Gailani's actions. Therefore, well-informed sources believe that the turmoil in Iraq has come to an end. According to a Vichy dispatch from Baghdad, the Mosul oilfields are undamaged and the situation in the Iraqi capital is peaceful. There has been no disturbance in the past 24 hours.

Content of the Ceasefire Terms

The official ceasefire terms set by the British Commander-in-Chief are as follows: (1) Cessation of war; (2) Iraqi troops to return to peacetime garrisons, including troops stationed in Ramadi; (3) All British prisoners of war to be released, Axis prisoners of war detained in Iraqi territory, and Iraqi prisoners of war to be handed over to the Regent. These terms apply to the entire territory of Iraq. It is heard that the new Iraqi government will grant the British request to allow British troops to transit through Iraq, and the ceasefire agreement does not change the British government's relations with Iraq within the scope of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. As for the release of captured Iraqi and Axis soldiers, it is conditional on the prior release of all British prisoners of war. There is no question of a peace treaty between Britain and Iraq because it is not appropriate to wage war. The ceasefire agreement was signed by the Iraqi committee led by the citizens of Baghdad. Furthermore, the Air Ministry's Information Office announced that the British commander in Iraq praised the close cooperation between the land and air forces, saying that the British Air Force launched a fierce attack on the Iraqi army's machine gun and artillery positions on Friday, which ultimately broke the morale of the Iraqi army. Shortly thereafter, the Iraqi army asked the British Ambassador to inquire about the British ceasefire terms. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

American Minister Protects British Nationals

When the Iraqi rebels occupied Baghdad, they planned to use the British people who had taken refuge in the British and American legations as hostages in order to prevent Baghdad from being bombed. When British women and children evacuated Baghdad on April 20, 500 British nationals who remained were ordered to take refuge in the British and American legations. After the outbreak of the war, the rebel Foreign Ministry sent a note to the American Minister, Mr. Knobloch, demanding that all Iraqis employed by the American legation be handed over, because the American legation might be bombed within an hour. According to the rebels, the British commander in Habbaniya had issued a despairing message, stating that if the nearby Iraqi troops did not immediately withdraw, the British would bomb the Baghdad administrative office. The Iraqi side had stated that if the British did carry out such a threat, they would retaliate by bombing the British, regardless of where they were hiding. The intention was that the Iraqi side would bomb the British and American legations where British nationals had taken refuge. In a crisis, the British nationals who took refuge in the American legation offered to leave the legation and be taken prisoner to prevent the legation from being bombed, but the American Minister preferred to risk his own life rather than allow the British nationals to leave the legation. Shortly thereafter, the rebels instructed the American Minister to hand over the British nationals so that they could be detained and treated as prisoners of war, but the Iraqi side did not prepare a suitable prisoner of war camp in advance, so the handing over of the British nationals was eventually cancelled. The British nationals slept on the floor in the legation for a month. The American Minister's hospitality was very thoughtful, and the British nationals were very grateful. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

Reuters diplomatic correspondent in London reports that the Governor of Mosul is sympathetic to Britain, and the area is now in the hands of friendly Iraqis. All German nationals have left, but it cannot be said that all oilfields are in friendly hands. The oilfields are not in Mosul, but some miles from Kirkuk, where some Germans have not yet been reported to have left. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

After the withdrawal of the French Consulate in Palestine, the Spanish Ambassador to that country, Mr. Pittili, visited Foreign Minister Sunar today, requesting that Spain take care of French interests in Palestine. The Spanish government has indicated its acceptance. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)

### European War Industry Talks (6) (10); Britain's Far East Arsenal; Australia's Resources and Manpower

The courage and combat prowess of Australian soldiers have been widely praised in this European war. They have defeated Italian tanks in North Africa and consolidated defenses in Singapore, safeguarding the British Empire in the Far East and Near East. However, it is not surprising that Australia has quietly become a major arsenal, producing a large number of new-style weapons, which is truly earth-shattering. In fact, Australia's swift response and armament reorganization have been among the best in the democracies. Australia's arms production has now exceeded India's and is catching up with Canada. Proportional to its population, Australia's achievement with only seven million people should make Britain and the United States feel ashamed.

Six years ago, Australia was a vast continent that only produced wool, minerals, and timber. Industrial products were all imported from Britain. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP) had a monopoly on mining all kinds of mineral deposits, including coal, iron, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and antimony. Iron ore was mined in the Iron Knob in South Australia, other metals were mined in the Broken Hill hinterland, and coal was mined in the coastal port of Newcastle, which now has huge furnaces and iron rolling mills. Since 1938, Australia's annual steel production has increased from 1.2 million tons to 1.7 million tons (US steel production last year was only 67 million tons). There are now several arsenals rushing to manufacture Lee-Enfield rifles and bayonets, Vickers heavy machine guns, Bofors guns and gun carriages, anti-aircraft guns, smokeless powder for naval use, ammunition, shells, bombs, patrol tanks, depth charges, mines, steel helmets, and aircraft parachutes. It took the British War Office four years to manufacture the first Bofors gun. After Australia obtained the blueprints, it took less than a year to produce it.

As for the aircraft industry, Australia is not yet able to manufacture first-line fighter planes, but it specializes in manufacturing training planes, especially North American Wirraway training planes. An aircraft factory is currently being set up near Sydney to manufacture Bristol Beaufort bombers. Australia's first-line aircraft include more than 100 American Lockheed Hudson aircraft. Its air force training program is expected to have 57,000 air force combatants, including 14,000 pilots, by 1943.

Australians can be relied upon for their perseverance, efficiency, and democratic spirit, especially the Minister for Munitions, Lewis, who, like William Knudsen, Chairman of the US National Defense Advisory Commission, has the talent for mass production. Lewis was originally the manager of BHP and was later selected by the government, just as Knudsen was originally the president of General Motors and was finally discovered by Roosevelt. Since the start of the war, Australia has spent nearly one billion US dollars on war expenses, conscripted 120,000 soldiers for expeditionary forces, 250,000 soldiers for national defense, undertaken wartime savings totaling 50 million US dollars, and in a year and a half, has jumped into the ranks of industrialized countries. Australia has now mobilized all its resources for British use. Among the main products, sugar is only grown by white people in Australia. The forests of Western Australia are lush and timber is abundant. Loggers only select large trees and do not cut down the entire tree. The famous Karri trees are up to 280 feet tall and 24 feet thick. There are even more Jarrah trees, and both types of timber are very strong. There are 140 million sheep in the country, producing a large amount of wool and mutton. The wool is long and strong, and is essential for sewing military uniforms. In addition, livestock, fruit, wheat, and various minerals are inexhaustible. Therefore, the minerals in the mountainous areas of Australia and the products along the coast can be used by Britain without limit. Oil has also been discovered in the mountains behind Sydney Harbour. BHP once used this as a threat to force Royal Dutch Shell to reduce its prices.

Sydney is the third largest metropolis in the British Empire, second only to London and Calcutta, with a population of 1.3 million. There are 5,000 factories in the city. Newcastle to the north and Kembla to the south are famous steelmaking areas, and their development is comparable to Pittsburgh, the center of the US steel industry. The iron ore used in these two regions is transported by cargo ship from Iron Knob Island in the south.

The iron ore from Iron Knob is mined by BHP, and the quantity is astonishing. The surface deposits alone amount to 100 million tons, which can be mined until the year 2000 AD. There is an immeasurable amount of ore underground. The ironworks in Newcastle are very well connected. The rolling mills can accommodate the entire iron block, the open hearth furnaces can accommodate the entire molten iron, the molten iron can digest a certain amount of ore, and each furnace has an adequate amount of coking coal to provide fuel.

After the iron block is refined, it is further refined into steel. Australia's industry shares a similar problem with the United States, which is the lack of various basic machines for manufacturing machinery. Most of the machines currently in use are purchased from the United States, Switzerland, and even Germany. According to the Deputy Minister of Munitions, Mr. Brooker, Australia now has 30 factories rushing to manufacture this kind of machinery, and has already ordered 10 million US dollars worth of machinery from abroad. There are 36 arsenals in the country, with 20,000 workers, and they are currently carrying out three major work plans, which require a large number of additional workers.

Australia's industrial products are naturally inferior to those of Britain, the United States, and Germany, but it is now actively adjusting to supply the British garrison in the Far East. The steel pipes produced by BHP's steelworks, the anti-aircraft guns produced by the Melbourne factory, and the training aircraft produced by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation are of excellent quality and can be manufactured in large quantities.

Australia is a world of pure white people, which is very different from other continents inhabited by white people. Australians are a nation that values self-respect, is straightforward, and is pragmatic, much like the people of Texas in the United States. Australians often wear dirty work clothes and felt hats, even in the forests. People in Sydney often wear tailcoats and white bow ties, entering and leaving low-class nightclubs as if nothing happened. Many Australians also have dentures in their mouths.

Australians have a large consumption. Together with their neighbors in New Zealand, they can consume the same amount of flour, butter, steak, and mutton as the rest of the world. They love tea and are good at making strong tea. The tea is jet black and carefully brewed in a quart-sized iron pot in the forest. They love swimming, despite the presence of sharks on the beach. Fifty sharks are caught in a day, but they are not afraid (there are now no sharks in Sydney's beaches).

Women's rights are quite developed in Australia. One of the only two stone statues in the capital, Canberra, is the goddess of war, Bellona, with a skull on her head and bare breasts, fully revealing the heroic spirit of women. Since the start of the war, women have often paraded in the streets, young and old, beautiful and ugly, all participating, and some are working as paramedics. Swimming is very popular in Sydney, and it produces healthy and beautiful women.

Sydney has a memorial plaque for the First World War, inscribed with the words "Lest We Forget" by the great British writer Rudyard Kipling. Australia is fighting alongside Britain again, which can be said to be in the spirit of the last war. The Acting Prime Minister of Australia said it well: "If a Pacific war breaks out, Australia will fight to the end to defend its independence. No one dares to say that Australia is isolated and unable to cope with the disaster."

### Vichy Reinforces North African Air Defenses; Protests Bombing of Sfax; British Side Has Not Yet Replied

The Vichy Paris "Today" newspaper reported today that since the British army bombed the port of Sfax in Tunisia, General Weygand, the commander-in-chief of the French army in Africa, has ordered the immediate reinforcement of air defenses in North Africa. (United Press dispatch from the 2nd)

Regarding the bombing of the port of Sfax by British aircraft, the French Ambassador to Spain, Mr. Pittili, protested to the British Ambassador to Spain, Sir Hall, today. (Havas dispatch from the 2nd)

London: The British side has not yet replied to the French protest to the United States regarding the bombing of the port of Sfax. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

### Judge Announces Ban on Defaming the Head of State

Vichy: According to a judge's report released yesterday, newspapers in French colonies and trust territories that defame the head of state, Marshal Pétain, will be sentenced to three months to two years in prison, or fined 100 to 3,000 francs, or both. In French Vietnam, those who sell pamphlets, pictures, badges, and films that undermine the French authorities will also be sentenced to the same penalties. (Haitong dispatch from the 2nd)

### British Conduct Landing Exercises on Southern Beaches; Navy and Army Participate; Valuable Lessons Learned

London: The British recently conducted simulated invasion exercises on the southern beaches of England. Heavy tanks, engineers, and infantry landed from flat-bottomed boats. This exercise had two purposes: one was to test coastal defenses, and the other was to practice the landing of troops and armored vehicles carried by flat-bottomed boats. The navy and air force participated. When the faint sound of engines was first heard at sea, a signal was sent out, and searchlights flashed across the sky, and artillery fire was also fired from the rear. At the same time, many flat-bottomed boats at sea were full of armed soldiers, with life preservers placed beside them. Engineers waded ashore, urgently cutting barbed wire and destroying defenses, and laying out the path for infantry and tanks to advance. Aircraft circled in the sky. The most moving scene was a team of flat-bottomed boats, neatly arranged under the searchlights, advancing side by side towards the shore. Soldiers jumped into the water and landed on the shore, some cutting barbed wire, some removing obstacles, and some attacking the searchlight teams. Everyone was doing their job, without hearing any commands, but occasionally there were whistle sounds. The lessons learned by both the attacking and defending sides were very valuable. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

### Axis Ships Detained or Sunk Not Less Than Three Million Tons

London: The Ministry of Economic Warfare issued a statement claiming that British Coastal Command bombers have repeatedly sunk enemy ships in the North Sea and the English Channel, especially recently. Since the start of the war, until May 13, Axis ships detained or sunk totaled not less than three million tons. The Axis countries are in urgent need of ships to solve transportation problems. Britain's actions to stop Axis-controlled shipping in the Mediterranean are seen by the Axis side as making the Mediterranean war comparable to the Atlantic war. The Ministry of Economic Warfare also mentioned Vice Premier Darlan's claim that Britain illegally detained 792,000 tons of French ships, saying that Darlan admitted that Free France detained 16,000 tons, 142,000 tons could not be used in American ports due to the US President's order, and 86,000 tons were directly serving the German side and were sunk while operating on the coast. On May 20, Vichy officials admitted that a total of 250,000 tons of French ships were confiscated by Germany in the occupied areas, so only 171,000 tons of French ships can be said to have fallen into British hands, while the Vichy government has detained a total of 200,000 tons of British and Allied ships in the ports of French North Africa and other colonies. This move by Vichy was instigated by the Axis Armistice Commission, which shows that the commission has controlled French ports and transportation lines. Darlan now says that France has the right to freely dispose of its ports and transportation lines. Britain did not formally recognize the fact that the German Armistice Commission misused French independence until the Vichy independence claim was abandoned by both Germany and Vichy. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

### Admiral Boehm is Alive

Nanjing: According to a Haitong News Agency correspondent in Nanjing, the British news agency's report that Admiral Boehm, the German naval commander in Norway, has committed suicide is completely inaccurate. Boehm is still in good health. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)

### British Armed Patrol Ship Sunk

London: The Admiralty announced that the British armed patrol merchant ship Salopian has sunk. The families of the dead and injured crew members have been notified. Sir Alan, the captain of the Salopian, served on the HMS Revenge in the last war and was the port director of Singapore. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)

Berlin learned this morning that German aircraft attacked the British fleet south of Crete yesterday, sinking one destroyer and heavily damaging one cruiser. On the same day, German and Italian dive bombers attacked the port of Tobruk, sinking five enemy troop carriers. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)

Berlin: Four British submarines have been sunk by German aircraft, two of which were near the British Isles, one near Malta, and one near Crete. However, the British Admiralty only acknowledged the loss of one submarine, the HMS Usk. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)

### All America Promotes "One Bowl of Rice" Movement; Giving Loyal Aid to China; San Francisco Raises US$100,000; Aiding China As Beneficial to America As Aiding England

San Francisco, May 10 dispatch: A grand "One Bowl of Rice" movement is underway throughout the United States, aiming to enable the American people to provide all possible assistance to the fighting Chinese people. The first report on the donations received from this movement has been announced. San Francisco also launched a "One Bowl of Rice" rally on May 2, which ended on May 5, lasting for four days. The pure income can exceed US$100,000. The final exact figure is not yet known, because the general office of the rally is still receiving donations from all parties.

Palace Lanterns, Dragon Gate from Hong Kong

The palace lanterns, dragon gate, and fireworks used in the rally were all transported from Hong Kong by the American President Lines, costing a total of US$780 in shipping fees. Because it is not allowed to transport goods without paying shipping fees, the American President Lines then donated all of the shipping fees to the "One Bowl of Rice Fund."

Crowded Meetings, Generous Donations

During the rally, the roads in San Francisco's Chinatown were temporarily renamed, such as Grant Avenue being renamed Zhongzheng Road and Stockton Street being renamed Linsen Road. The rally was originally scheduled for three days, but because the participants were extremely crowded and made generous donations to help China's struggle, it was extended for one day. At the same time, American figures urged Americans to participate in "One Bowl of Rice" rallies held in various places, generously donating and emphasizing the close relationship between aiding China and aiding England.

Madame Chiang Calls to America

Madame Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to appeal to the American people, stating, "The purpose of your initiation of this movement to provide relief to wartime refugees is indeed worthy. Those who wholeheartedly sympathize with us will be outraged by the poverty and suffering caused by this barbaric war. China has millions of empty rice bowls, and we are doing our best to relieve poverty, but we warmly welcome the great assistance from the world's most compassionate country."

Ambassador Hu Shih Elucidates Significance

Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih stated, "China's cause has won the heartfelt support of the American people. This is not only because China is striving to strengthen itself, but also because China's resolute resistance has become a bulwark in the Far East to protect human freedom against arbitrary destruction and enslavement by dark forces. China's cause is an indispensable part of the humanitarian cause."

Mrs. Roosevelt Also Attends

During the "One Bowl of Rice" movement in San Francisco, Mrs. Roosevelt suddenly arrived and entered the local Chinese Six Companies, purchasing "Humanitarian Corps" buttons. According to an official announcement, on May 20, the famous singer Lily Pons participated in a charity concert in New York's Carnegie Hall to support China. This was Ms. Pons' first stage appearance in New York in a year. The Chinese writer Lin Yutang will also give a speech entitled "New China." The proceeds will be handed over to the United China Relief, which is raising US$5 million to engage in relief and reconstruction work in China.

Counselor General Arnold Gives Eloquent Speech

American Commercial Counselor General Arnold issued a famous speech for the "One Bowl of Rice" rally, stating, "This move can explain to the 450 million people of China who are at war, on behalf of American men, women, old and young, that at this most tragic time in China's 4,500-year history, we sincerely extend our infinite sympathy. This sympathy arises from our deep belief in the greatest and most noble appeal in human history, that this populous and resolute ancient country has the right to occupy a recognized equal position among other countries. On the eve of the start of this year's 'One Bowl of Rice' rally, we respectfully salute the Chinese immigrants who are committed to this highly commendable common purpose, and we ask the people of the country to take this extraordinary opportunity to lend a hand and help make the 'Chinese rice bowl' full to overflowing. In this way, our great Asian neighbor will know that this rice bowl is a symbol of American goodwill, and that the United States firmly believes that a free and independent China is absolutely necessary for peace in the Pacific."

Pearl Buck Discusses the Essentials of Aiding China

The famous writer Pearl Buck also issued a statement, saying, "Strengthening the friendship between China and the United States is in our best interest, and for our own benefit, we should give China rapid and strong assistance, just like helping England. Helping China defeat Japan is tantamount to defeating Hitler in the East, and defeating him in the East in the next fifty years is far more important than defeating him in Europe. I am not only speaking for my own benefit, but also for my true love for the Chinese people. The people of China and the United States are truly friendly to each other. I admire their old culture and their modern courage. They are truly a great nation, worthy of our giving all assistance and loyal friendship. If we cooperate with them, we will definitely make the world the world we need."

Strengthen the Belief of the Chinese People

New York Governor Lehman wrote in a letter, "We must do our best to strengthen the Chinese people's belief in and hope for democratic standards, and make China the outpost of democratic countries in Asia. I hope the fundraising campaign will be a great success." The famous editor Wyatt also telegraphed, "China is a free country, and its people are fighting for national freedom. This is the century of the Chinese people. If they gain freedom, they will be able to solve their economic and industrial problems in our mechanical age. The area where the United States will receive the most reward for investing in world security is to donate to this civilian relief fund." The "One Bowl of Rice" rally held throughout the United States is hosted by the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, chaired by Colonel Roosevelt Jr. The chairman of the United China Relief is Brymmel White.

### Travelers to Burma Must Have Complete Visas

Those without Burmese government permits will have extreme difficulty landing and may be repatriated. Any Chinese travelers passing through Burma and traveling via the Yunnan-Burma highway to the rear areas of the interior should complete their visa procedures before going to Rangoon to ensure they are fully compliant. Otherwise, they may face detention and repatriation. According to a reporter from Ping Ming News Agency who spoke with people in the shipping industry yesterday, Rangoon authorities are conducting extremely strict inspections of travelers arriving from Hong Kong. If passport procedures are not completely in order (such as the passport not being signed by the bearer), there is a risk of detention, punishment, or return on the same ship. Recently, when the Hai Xing vessel arrived in Rangoon, sixteen second-class passengers, despite having visas from the British Consulate in Chongqing or the Hong Kong government on their passports, were detained because they had not obtained prior consent from the Burmese government. The Rangoon authorities deemed the procedures incomplete, and they were not allowed to disembark. Later, the Chinese Consulate-General in Burma lodged an urgent protest, and representatives from the Chinese travel industry in Rangoon went to the Water Police Bureau, the Police Station, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of National Defense to explain that the lack of procedures on their passports was not the fault of the travelers. They argued that the passengers should not suffer due to the negligence of the British Consulate or the Hong Kong government. After three days of effort, they were finally allowed to land. However, the passengers had already been delayed, and their luggage was also detained and sent to customs. In the sweltering heat, they had no change of clothes, making their situation very difficult. Therefore, in the future, travelers going to Rangoon must have the Burmese government's reply or telegram permitting entry (Reference Home Dept Letter Datde) noted when applying for a visa from the British authorities to avoid unexpected incidents.

### Confirmation of Train Derailment on Shanghai-Nanjing Line

Yesterday, the Japanese authorities announced details regarding the train derailment on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, which were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to a report in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the Japanese authorities here announced today (the 2nd) that at 9:17 PM on Saturday night, a passenger train on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, heading towards Nanjing, detonated a landmine near Weiting, Suzhou. The locomotive and one carriage were completely derailed, but only two people were injured by flying glass shards. It is rumored that the landmine was detonated via electrical control. Official Japanese sources also stated that traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing line was fully restored by 7:00 AM yesterday (the 1st). However, Chinese sources reported that several passengers died in the explosion, and it took approximately fifteen hours for the train to resume operation. Recently, guerrilla activity has increased along the Japanese-controlled railway lines. Although the Japanese army has erected electric fences on both sides of the tracks and attempted to search for guerrillas, they are still vulnerable to guerrilla attacks.

### Business Colleagues Demand Separate Salary Payment

Socks dyeing prices increased. Yesterday was the date determined by the business side for distributing funds. Five to six hundred dismissed male and female employees gathered at the office of lawyer Wang Yaotang at 692 Weihaiwei Road around 8:00 AM. All stated that they could not accept the severance pay until the dismissal conditions were agreed upon and that the salary for the second half of May should be distributed immediately and not be lumped together. Because there was no one in charge, the mood was very tense, but order was extraordinarily good, and there were no transgressions. The delegation then sent representatives to lawyer Wang Yaotang's office on Baker Road to discuss the matter. They were received and expressed sympathy. Regarding the request for payment of salary for the second half of May, they promised to inquire with the company and provide a response promptly. This morning, they hope colleagues will still gather at Weihaiwei Road to hear the news. After the resolution of the labor dispute in the local yarn and sock dyeing industry, new measures will be implemented from the 1st of this month. The business side believes that expenses have increased and will raise dyeing prices by several percent.

### Plague Outbreak in Ningbo

Ningbo experienced a sudden outbreak of plague starting at the end of October last year, resulting in extremely heavy casualties. Fortunately, the Central Epidemic Prevention Team, Zhejiang Province health personnel, and the Yinxian County government hospital actively cooperated in prevention and control efforts, and the epidemic was eradicated. Unexpectedly, when the Japanese army advanced to Ningbo last month, all government agencies withdrew, causing health work to cease, and the plague resurfaced. Recently, more than a dozen people have contracted the disease one after another, and six of them have died without treatment.

### Eleanor Roosevelt Participates in Rice Bowl Movement

The entire United States, both government and public, is launching a Rice Bowl Movement to fully support China. On May 4th, Eleanor Roosevelt suddenly attended the opening ceremony of the San Francisco Rice Bowl Movement. The photo shows Mrs. Roosevelt shaking hands with Ms. Carol Chow.

### US Government Decides to Use Two President Liners

Although the rumor that the four President liners of the American President Lines - President Jackson, President Taft, President Pierce, and President Adams - would be requisitioned for military use has not been confirmed by the Shanghai office, it has been reliably learned that the US Maritime Commission has decided to requisition the company's President Coolidge and President Cleveland, which operate on the Pacific route, to meet the navy's need for a rapid increase in auxiliary ships. The requisition orders for these two liners have already been issued, and they will soon be transferred to government management. It is understood that the Shanghai office of American President Lines did not deny this rumor yesterday.

### President Coolidge Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow

The President Coolidge of the American President Lines, coming east from Los Angeles, is scheduled to arrive in port at 10:00 PM tomorrow and will berth at buoys 11 and 12.

### Today is Anti-Smoking Day: Eliminate All Poisons; Citizens Voluntarily Assist the National Government; Youth Circles Should Encourage Mutual Discipline

Today is Anti-Smoking Day. The entire city's population is resolved to promote anti-smoking policies, based on the idea that a strong nation begins with a strong people, and a strong people begins with a strong body. The court is also burning confiscated narcotics. Details are noted below.

National Government Determined to Thoroughly Eradicate

The National Government authorities, recognizing that the harm caused by narcotics to the nation is greater than that of floods and ferocious beasts, established the National Anti-Smoking Committee six years ago to completely eliminate toxins and clean up the toxic atmosphere. President Chiang himself served as the director, issuing orders nationwide for a three-year ban on drugs and a five-year ban on smoking. During this period, any narcotics must be prohibited. After receiving the orders, various places acted swiftly and effectively. However, since the outbreak of war, in the occupied areas, political guidelines were lost, and the ban on smoking was abandoned. The central authorities have a very strong determination to thoroughly enforce the ban, adhering to the established policy. From now on, anyone who still transports, sells, or smokes will be severely punished according to the Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Punishment Regulations.

Citizens Consciously Eliminate Toxic Atmosphere

People from all walks of life, recognizing that the isolated island is in a special environment, have decided to unanimously assist the government and promote the anti-drug movement to implement the central government's anti-smoking policy. All fathers, elder brothers, teachers, superiors, and friends should strictly warn their children and subordinates to eliminate bad habits. If addicted to smoking, they must quit within a limited time. Otherwise... thoroughly eliminate the toxic atmosphere.

### Coal Briquette Prices Rise Amid Talk of Stability

Major Coal Briquette Factories Secretly Agree to Increase Retail Prices by One Dollar Per Load

Representatives of four or five major coal briquette factories held an illegal meeting and agreed that, starting from June 1st, the price of coal briquettes from the factory would increase sharply from 296 yuan to 316 yuan per ton, plus a delivery fee of 4 yuan, making it 310 yuan per ton. The retail price per load (100 jin) would increase from 16 yuan to 17 yuan. These people dared to secretly decide on this price increase, which is extremely illegal. The industry association has not yet officially recognized this illegal price increase.

### Japanese Murotomaru Vessel Enters, Awaiting Sailing on Shanghai-Ningbo Route

The Japanese-owned Toa Shipping Company's Murotomaru vessel conducted a trial voyage on the Shanghai-Ningbo line on the 26th and returned to Shanghai on the 28th. Due to quarantine requirements, it anchored in Wusong for a long time. After completing the procedures, it sailed into the Huangpu River around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 1st) and is now docked at the Old White Bund Wharf (formerly the Osaka Wharf), ready to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo route.

### Democratic Radio to Broadcast Guo Taiqi's Speech

The local Democratic Radio, frequency 440, call sign XCD, is scheduled to broadcast Guo Taiqi's speech from the BBC in London starting at 7:30 PM today. The speech was given by Guo before he left the UK and was recorded by the BBC. It is scheduled to be broadcast today as the start of the BBC's Chinese programming. Listeners can tune in. The BBC will broadcast Mandarin programs every Tuesday at 4:30 PM (Shanghai time). Those with shortwave radios can tune to 16.86 meters to listen.

### Chinese Air Force Will Have Surprising Performance This Year; United States Cannot Tolerate and Actively Aids China; Determined to Retaliate Against Japanese Aircraft Terror; The China Press Speculates on the Future Tasks of American Pilots Coming to China

The China Press editorial states that, according to reliable sources from Washington, the US War Department has now permitted its Air Force personnel, including pilots and mechanics, to voluntarily resign from the Army Air Corps to serve in China. It is said that a group of aviation personnel is en route to China. Sources in Chongqing also acknowledge that authorities began preparing for the accommodation of US aviation personnel arriving in China some time ago.

Adopting a Retaliatory Policy in the Future

When American aviation personnel will target Japan is currently unknown. It is likely that their initial targets will be limited to the Japanese army on the Chinese front lines and the Japanese navy in Chinese waters. However, before the end of this year, American and Chinese aviation personnel may fly to Japan and bomb its industrial cities. This cannot be ruled out as impossible. Today's industrial manufacturing plants are considered legitimate military targets, and retaliation has become a principle of aviation warfare. The terror inflicted by the Japanese army on China in the past may one day be retaliated against.

The Japanese Government Asking for Trouble

The Japanese army and government have been asking for trouble with the United States more than once, such as violating treaties with the United States, sinking the USS Panay, insulting and mistreating Americans in the Far East and damaging their property, and entering into the Tripartite Pact with European aggressor nations. All of these are intolerable to the United States.

Advantage Will Disappear

People throughout China are delighted and excited by the news that American aviation personnel are coming to China to assist in the fight against Japan. Chongqing understands that the advantage held by the Japanese air force in Chinese airspace will disappear due to the arrival of American aviation personnel and the strengthening of the Chinese air force.

Governing the Country with the Three Principles of the People, Working Together in the Same Boat

Chongqing Minister of Military Affairs General He Yingqin has taken this opportunity to declare that China's fate is intertwined with that of Britain and the United States and has pointed out that China is a member of the ABC (initials of America, Britain, and China) alliance. He also guarantees that during the war, China's airfields and other aviation facilities will be available to the United States.

China's Situation Is Turning for the Better

General He's opinion that the United States should first resolve the Pacific issue from a military standpoint is an accurate view. He likely means the policy of choosing the weakest opponent to attack in a battle. If the US Navy resolves the issue of Japan before the end of the year, it will be a great benefit to the democratic camp and may allow the Soviet Union to join and jointly remove the threat of the Nazis. After four years of hard fighting against Japan, China is turning for the better.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Employees Request Salary Increase

According to reliable sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council's employees have generally requested a salary increase, which has been initially considered by the Council and is expected to be approved soon. It is understood that the employees are requesting an average increase of 40% on basic salaries and temporary allowances. As of yesterday morning, the Council had no official information on this matter. It is believed that the increase will range from 15% to 45%, with most being around 40%.

### Foreign Firms Selling Imported Rice: Over 6,000 Tons Dumped; Grain Merchants Agreeing to New Terms for Resale; Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice Purchases Underway

The number of Small Sieve Rice initially ordered from the Shanghai Municipal Council by various rice merchants exceeded 10,000 . Payment and collection of goods are nearing completion. Therefore, Jardine Matheson and MacKenzie, since last Wednesday have been handling the second batch of purchase formalities. According to a Ping Ming News Agency reporter's investigation, the first to apply to Jardine Matheson for the second batch were Tairun and Shengxing, each allocated 500 tons of rice. The remaining fifteen grain merchants also followed suit and have now begun to allocate the supplies. Furthermore, this time, the grain merchants who are purchasing are not limited to the seventeen designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council, such as Tairun. Even those who did not initially order have also applied to purchase, including Wanshengtai, Dan--, and Taitai. According to a MacKenzie employee, the total amount ordered in the second batch will be the same as the first batch, around 10,000 tons.

Retail Rice Shops Must Comply with Conditions

Yesterday, MacKenzie also received a notice from the Municipal Council that when grain merchants sell rice to retail rice shops, they must include the conditions stipulated by the Municipal Council. These conditions are currently being printed by MacKenzie and will be distributed to the grain merchants soon. The contents are as follows: The contractor agrees to strictly abide by the following conditions when purchasing rice specified in the retail rice contract: (1) This rice shall be retailed to the Shanghai public, and the price shall not exceed the highest price set by the Shanghai Municipal Council for the sale of this type of rice. The retailer shall at all times prominently display the price of this type of rice within its premises. (2) This rice shall only be sold to consumers for personal consumption and not for profit. (3) This rice shall be sold during normal business hours to meet public needs, subject to the restrictions imposed by the Municipal Council at the time of sale. (4) This rice shall be sold as is and shall not be mixed with other types of rice.

Eleven Rice Shops Resume Sales

On April 28th, thirty-three rice shops in the Concession had their rights to sell Small Sieve Rice revoked by the Municipal Council for failing to pay and collect goods on time. Last week, eight rice shops, including Taishan, were first allowed to resume sales. Yesterday, more rice shops went to Jardine Matheson to request resumption of sales, and the Municipal Council has permitted Tongan, Datung, and Dalongxing to pay and collect goods, restoring their sales rights. According to a Jardine Matheson employee, the authorities are leniently handling the punished rice shops to consider the food needs of the city and the business of the rice shops.

French Municipal Council Registers Saigon Rice

To actively stabilize the food supply, the authorities have repeatedly urged various rice industry associations to actively register rice grains in order to implement effective measures as soon as possible. The authorities have now stipulated the types of rice grains to be registered: (1) Saigon rice, regardless of grade, whether high or low, and whether it has arrived or not, must be registered with the French Municipal Council. (2) Small Sieve Rice and other imported rice must be registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council. (3) National rice is relatively small in quantity, so registration will be postponed for the time being. The authorities are now urging rice industry committee members to assist.

Hong Kong Rice Dumped by Ten Merchants

It is learned that the Municipal Council has continued to negotiate with the Hong Kong government for monthly shipments of 250,000 bags of Guangmi (Hong Kong Rice) to Shanghai. The amount to be supplied for the previous month has completely arrived, and 6,000 tons of rice for this month have also arrived. Jardine Matheson has now dumped them with ten rice merchants, including Hengfengtai, Gongda, Ruiyuan, Faxingxie, Yuanda, etc. The price per bag has been officially set by the Municipal Council at 124.70 yuan, but the rice merchants sell it to the rice shops for 123.50 yuan, and the rice shops sell it for 110 yuan per shi.

Dafoe Sells Saigon Rice at Set Prices

According to sources from the French firm Dafoe, after the firm was ordered by the French authorities to purchase rice grains from Saigon, it has to be assessed by those authorities before being sold to the rice merchants. The firm has already sold a total of about 1,000 tons of 1st and 2nd grade Saigon mixed broken rice twice. The firm -- yesterday sold about 450 tons of 1st and 2nd grade Saigon mixed broken rice, the price of which was assessed by the French authorities at 97.60 yuan per -- . It is understood that the Saigon rice purchased by the firm, regardless of grade, is more than that of Hery, Fuhua and other firms.

The other suspect is a thug named Liang Zhengguang, age forty.

Two Suspects Arrested

It is heard that this robbery involved internal collusion, implicating a large number of employees in the Post Office remittance department. The Japanese authorities this morning acknowledged that they had recovered the stolen money and arrested the main suspects and stated that the final investigation procedures are expected to be completed today, after which the stolen money will be returned in full to the postal authorities. It is revealed that Nomura was arrested along with Liang at his Shigaota residence just after noon yesterday (the 1st). After arresting the two suspects, the Japanese Military Police conducted a thorough search of their residence, recovering the stolen money hidden in one room.

Internal Collaborator

It is heard that after being arrested, the two suspects confessed to committing the robbery and implicated several employees in the Post Office remittance department, saying that the movement of the money was informed by people in the remittance department. Nomura and Liang colluded and conspired to commit the robbery. Liang is originally from Shandong Province and does not have a regular job. He knows employees in the Post Office remittance department, from whom he learned that the central government in Chongqing had 2.5 million yuan transported from Hong Kong to repay overdrafts from post offices in Shanghai and nearby areas.

Monitoring Movement

The money arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon on a British ship and was stored in a warehouse on the Bund in the French Concession. The two suspects monitored the movement of the money. On Saturday morning, they saw the money being transported out of the warehouse and followed the postal truck carrying the money to the Postal Headquarters at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and North Suzhou Road in a Japanese-owned rental car (license number 5152). After the car entered the headquarters, the two suspects ordered the people on the truck to transfer the money to the rental car and then sped away.

Swift Resolution

The car was later abandoned in Hongkou and discovered by the police in the International Settlement. That night, the police detained the driver of the rental car and, after questioning him, handed him over to the Japanese authorities. The Japanese Military Police obtained clues from the driver and went to Shigaota Road yesterday morning to arrest the two suspects. It is heard that in addition to confessing to the crime, the two suspects have also confessed to the person who provided information about the movement of the huge sum of money. Therefore, several other people may be arrested in succession.

### Playing Chess and Sipping Tea in Seclusion, Suddenly Encountering a Deadly Ambush: Bloodshed Occurs in Hongning Lane, Caishi Road; Sun Sujun and Zhang Yunjie Die Unexpectedly

A shooting occurred at 3:50 PM yesterday in Hongning Lane, Caishi Road, in the French Concession. Two people were killed, and the assailant fled the scene with the weapon. The details are noted below:

Playing Chess and Sipping Tea

Hongwu Society is located at No. 3, Lane 257, Caishi Road, i.e. Hongning Lane, with over hundreds of members scattered everywhere. At about 3:50 PM yesterday afternoon, the host, Sun Sujun, 45 years old from Hubei, and his fellow villager, Zhang Yunjie, 36 years old, were playing chess and sipping tea in the living room. Unexpectedly, disaster struck suddenly.

Two People Die

Suddenly, an assailant about thirty years old, wearing a black Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants, walked in. Without asking any questions, the assassin pulled out a gun and fired five shots in a row. At that time, Sun and Zhang were unable to avoid the bullets and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Sun was hit in the head and chest by one bullet each, while Zhang was shot twice in the chest. Both were fatal wounds and died one after another due to their severe injuries. Seeing that the objective had been achieved, the assassin then fled the scene with the weapon.

The Assailant Flees

After the Lou-kia-wan Central Police Station received the news, they immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to strictly apprehend the criminal. However, the criminal had already fled without a trace. Cartridge casings were recovered from the surrounding area. The two bodies were transported by vehicle to the small ward of the Tu-las-the Road hospital, and the police were tracking down the perpetrator and investigating the cause. It is understood that Sun and Zhang had worked for the French tram company, had many disciples, and had some potential power. The reason for the attack is said to be related to the labor union.

### Chemico Drug Factory Begins Expansion

Chemico Drug Factory, with the English name (Chemico), was originally a famous drug factory operated by Westerners. Its products, such as Calcium Mother, have long been designated by major hospitals and doctors in Shanghai. However, they were mostly popular in hospitals established by Westerners and among well-known Western doctors, so they have not been fully popularized among Chinese people. Recently, Shanghai commercial giants Sheng Pihua, Xie Shengzu, Xu Yongzuo, Xie Zhonghe, etc., have raised huge sums of money to hire four people from the original factory, including Vienna's renowned drug factory manager, pharmacist, and others, namely Ketzkegaard Hans, to continue as the manufacturing and production leaders. Therefore, all of their products are no different from imported goods. In particular, the anti-tuberculosis drug "Para Calcium Mother" is the leader among calcium supplements, and has long been famous in Shanghai, frequently used by high-class individuals. The factory's headquarters and main business office are located in the Xie Jin Building on Yuamingyuan Road, the main factory is in the Zhangjiazhai on Dunxin Road, and a branch factory is set up on Yunnan Road. In addition, they have contracted with the China-England Pharmacy as the general manager's office in Shanghai. In the future, they will also set up a general distribution office at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guizhou Road. The chairman of the board is Mr. Sheng Pihua, the general manager is Xie Zhihui, the deputy managers are Sheng Kangnian and Li Xianying, and the business director is Ling Jingsheng.

### Chinese Gastrointestinal Diseases: Summer Clinic Hours

The Chinese Gastrointestinal Specialized Hospital, located in the building at No. 587 Jingan Temple Road, west of Chengdu Road, is a unique specialized gastrointestinal hospital in Shanghai. Although the hospital has only been open for a few months, its reputation is rising steadily. It has recently been reported that the hospital, in order to prevent patients from suffering from the midday heat, has specially changed the morning clinic hours to 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM, and the afternoon hours to 2:30 PM to 7:00 PM.

### Weather Report

On the same day last year, the highest was 94.6 and the lowest was 64.4.

### Finance: Chinese Merchants Cover Foreign Exchange, Noon Suddenly Tight

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The HSBC listed exchange rates did not change, and the black market for British and American exchanges continued to soften. Initially, around 1:30 PM, because HSBC sold US dollars at 5.375, the exchange rate briefly rose to 5.40625, making it difficult to sell. However, as the price of gold rose, HSBC stopped selling at 11:30 AM, and the exchange rate immediately softened to 5.34375. The British exchange only settled at 3 pence, 29.6875. In the afternoon, speculators dumped June futures and posted July futures at a discount of US$0.03125, mostly swaps. Foreign banks posted bids, stabilizing the situation. The final British exchange rate was 3 pence, 29.6875, tighter by 0.015625, and the US dollar was 5.34375, tighter by 0.03125. Trading was extremely active throughout the day. Chinese merchants and speculators together shorted US dollars amounting to 700,000 yuan, and rolled over from June to short July futures amounting to 1,000,000 yuan. Because the weather is getting hotter every day, the market closed early at 3:30 PM.

Exchange: Early Market Stuffed

Since the morning, foreign telegrams reported that the silver market in India had rebounded, and there was no market in America and England. Exchange rates against Shanghai were down 0.02 for the US dollar and down 0.03125 for the British pound. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates did not change. The domestic market opened early with bank selling prices. The spot British exchange rate was 3 pence, 31.25, and the US dollar was 5.375, both returning to the closing prices of Saturday afternoon last week. Chinese merchants and speculators initially attempted to short US dollars for June at 5.40625 but failed. Soon, HSBC supplied a significant amount at 5.375. Therefore, the HSBC listed exchange rates did not change. After the white silver balancing tax was at 24.25 per cent, speculators once again stuffed the Citibank and HSBC June-July futures at 5.40625. At 9:45 AM, the exchange rate rose to the point where it was difficult to sell and settle. After 10:00 AM, Chinese merchants and speculators again covered their shorts, and after HSBC sold again at 5.375, the supply intention weakened, and the short covering intensified. The noon closing British exchange rate was 3 pence, 29.6875, and the US dollar was 5.34375.

Foreign Merchants Also Show Good Interest

In the afternoon, speculators again shorted June futures at 5.34375 and stuffed July futures at 5.375. The foreign merchant banks seemed to have better interest in buying, and the situation was relatively stable. At the 4:30 PM closing, spot to June-July futures were all British exchange rate at 3 pence, 19.6875, and the US dollar at 5.34375. Compared to the noon closing prices of spot to June futures on Saturday last week, the British pound was tighter by 0.015625, and the US dollar was tighter by 0.03125. The July futures, because of the new price, had no comparison, it was said.

Hong Kong Exchange Market on Holiday

### Large Traders Turn Bullish, Gold Market Rises Sharply, Price Nears 6,500 Yuan Mark

The gold market yesterday was hot, and the black market was rising. The bullish sentiment of all parties became even firmer, and the price rose close to the 6,500 yuan mark. As foreign exchange tightened amidst speculative short covering, rumors spread in the afternoon that the HSBC bank in Saigon had ceased operations, leading to some speculation about the Burma Road. Therefore, after the opening, with the selling pressure from the three gold shops, the price briefly reached 6,425 yuan. Soon, Tong Kangyong turned from short to long, aggressively buying 7,000 to 8,000 taels. Hengji, Dafeng, and Hesheng added to their purchases, and Yifeng aggressively bought as well, with the price showing a trend of large increases and small declines. Before the evening closing, the price reached 6,480 yuan, and finally rose again by 53 yuan. About 60,000 taels were traded throughout the day. Cash gold was first sold by Tong Kangyong to Zhongxing for 40 taels, at a price 310 yuan higher than the futures price. Then, it was sold to Chengji for 90 taels, at a price 205 yuan higher. Hong Qingyong sold 30 taels, and Yida sold 10 taels, both of which were bought by Junxianghe, at a price 300 yuan higher. No trading was heard in the afternoon. There were sellers at 300 yuan higher, and the price also rose by more than 50 yuan. The prices of gold ornaments and customs gold were unchanged, it was said.

Futures Continue to Rise by 53 Yuan

From the morning, the June futures (per bar of 10 taels) opened at 9:15 AM, immediately up 17 yuan, to 6,440 yuan. Amidst buying pressure, it continued to rise to 6,450 yuan. It was heard that HSBC aggressively sold US dollars at 5.375, and speculators stopped short covering and began to sell, so the price hardened slightly. Sellers emerged, with Chengji, Deda, and Shihe gold shops selling, and Xinfengyong and Defu also selling, retracting by 25 yuan, to 6,425 yuan. Tong Kangyong suddenly covered their shorts, and Hesheng also bought, raising the price to around 6,430 yuan, which remained stable for a long time. Near noon, Tong Kangyong aggressively bought to cover their shorts non-stop, and Dafeng and Hengji added to their purchases, with the rise gradually sharpening, jumping 30 yuan, reaching 6,460 yuan. Yiyuan aggressively sold only slightly, and Yida also sold, falling back to 6,448 yuan. Dafeng aggressively bought again, pushing the price up again. The noon closing was 6,457 yuan, and after the closing, 6,461 yuan. The 2:00 PM opening in the afternoon was 6,470 yuan, 13 yuan higher than the noon closing price. Yiyuan and Defu aggressively sold, and the price retreated slightly to 6,458 yuan. Tong Kangyong again added to their positions and aggressively bought, and Dafeng, Hesheng, and Yifeng also bought, and the price gradually rose by 22 yuan, reaching 6,480 yuan. Xinfengyong, Defu, and Shihe came to sell, and the price finally stabilized slightly. The 3:30 PM closing was 6,476 yuan, a continued rise of 53 yuan from the 6,000 yuan closing last Saturday. Based on the June US dollar closing price of 5.34375, the price was 6,517 yuan, with a difference of 41 yuan. The after-hours price was flat. There was a fluctuation of 55 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold from the gold shops was 310 yuan higher than the spot futures price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for current margin gold.

Price of Gold Ornaments Remains Unchanged

The price of gold jewelry at silver shops, both Datongxing and Xintongxing, remained unchanged at 695 yuan per tael, and the buying price was reduced by 40 yuan, it was said.

### Foreign Currencies Mostly Rise, Few Fall

The situation in the foreign currency market yesterday: the spot market price continued to rise, and the British and American gold pounds also rose by 1 yuan each. The British gold note remained stable, and the market price was flat. The American gold note rose to 18.31 yuan at closing, up 0.16 yuan from last week. The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes were balanced, and the market price was flat. The Japanese gold note's momentum was still soft, and it retreated to 1.965 yuan in the evening market. The trend of Korean notes was stable, and the evening market remained at the original price of 1.65 yuan.

### Grains: Mold Decree, Rice Prices Fall Slightly

Yesterday's foreign rice market situation: both futures and spot prices trended downward, and the situation was weak. The current inventory is abundant, and shipments are pouring in. The actual sales of public sale rice at flat prices by local residents are not strong. The demand from inland villages is limited, and the new stockpiles lack stimulus or attraction. Many owners, considering the hot weather, find it difficult to store for long, and are eager to sell at a price and get out early, not to mention the price of small rice has already exceeded 110 yuan. The Municipal Council is still selling at around 105 yuan, and the difference between the two is so large that it is too significant, so buyers are hesitant, and the market is difficult to stand firm, and shows a downward trend. No. 1 Saigon fell from 125.5 yuan to 122 yuan, No. 2 from 120 yuan to 118 yuan, No. 2 Siam from 116 yuan to 114 yuan, small rice from 120 yuan to 117 yuan, and Min Dang Gao from 123 yuan to 119 yuan. Crushed pointed rice was at 93.5 yuan. At this point, actual sales moved slightly, and a slight stabilization was felt, but eventually it became hovering. As a result, each price fell by 3 to 4 yuan compared to the previous week. Small rice futures and spot prices were both slightly down to 138.5 yuan per original bag, crushed rice was at 107 yuan, and futures were slightly down to 104.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon was at 143-144 yuan. In new transactions, Dingtong sold 2,000 tons of Siam No. 2 and a half at a price of only 130 yuan. A total of 10,000 bags and over 700 tons were traded throughout the day.

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The French ship G.G. AVarenne, managed by the Walun Foreign Firm, directly transported over 30,500 bags of foreign rice from Saigon. The ship arrived in port on the morning of the previous day (1st) and docked at the Qichang Stack in Pudong to unload (ancestor).

It is heard that the inventories of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice in the mainland are thin and few are arriving daily.

It is now the time for mold decree, and fresh goods are lacking. Only some early and late rice are arriving. Most of the thick japonica rice is old stock. Therefore, yesterday the way forward for early and late rice was uniquely prosperous, and the goods were scarce, so they were immediately sold out, and the market price suddenly increased by more than 3 yuan. Opening price was 139 yuan, 137 yuan, original bag 142 yuan, 140 yuan. Only Kunshan goods were offered at 132 yuan for thick japonica rice, a depreciation of 1-2 yuan, and the transactions were few.

The Dragon Boat Festival has passed for glutinous rice, and the way forward has become less frequent, but the market goods are also limited. Therefore, the market has not changed. The opening price was 114-115 yuan for Hong Kong white yuan, 107 yuan to 105 yuan for glutinous mung bean, and 100-120 yuan for domestic glutinous rice.

### Flour: Local and Foreign Both Lack Initiative

Current foreign flour transactions have deteriorated again, due to the impact of the rice price decline. The morale of all parties is difficult to rise, and the new wheat industry in the mainland has already shown its appearance, although it has not yet been listed. Speculative trading is cautious at this point. Local customers are also taking this opportunity to avoid large-scale purchases. However, Australian flour is attracting special attention from those holding goods, as the source is not continued and the inventory is thin. Yesterday, the market sold Flower and Bird brand Australian flour for 30.05 yuan, up 0.1 yuan from last week. Also, the price for bank stack bag weight is required to be 31.1 yuan. Approximately 2,000 bags were traded. Other Kenmei flour transactions held up in the morning, but could not hold up in the afternoon. Golden Dragon flour opened at 29.45 yuan, and Fort powder opened at 30.015 yuan, each slightly lower by 0.45 yuan. In the afternoon, Clock flour only opened at 30.02 yuan, slightly lower by 0.45 yuan compared to the end of last week. Approximately 10,000 bags were traded. There was no market for wheat.

### Miscellaneous Grains: New Beans Difficult to Transport, Arrivals Do Not Meet Demand

Yesterday was the second day for new green broad beans to be on the market. Only Beigang goods were available. The market price rose by 0.6 yuan, opening at 42.8 yuan. About 400 bags were distributed from Shantou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Mujie. Because the Hong Kong gang had no shipping space, they did not inquire yesterday. Today, the situation in the market is even worse than before, and transportation is even more difficult. Currently, it is completely dependent on bicycle transportation, so the quantity does not meet the demand. Moreover, this year's harvest is only about 60% of the usual amount, and the products are not good. The pods are thin and the beans are small, due to uneven rainfall and lack of fertilizer. Therefore, the potential future is quite tight. Other grains have all turned weak, and the bean cake downturn is even more severe. In short, actual sales are not rising. The market is all about the "rubber ball principle," so the overall situation is somewhat bearish, and the market price is falling step by step. As a result, prices were down 0.5-0.6 yuan compared to the end of the week. A total of over 30,000 pieces of various cakes were traded. On the 3rd, 400 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Securities: Government Bonds Trend Higher

Government Bonds in the black market. Yesterday's market continued to be good, as the interest payment for the 11th issue was approaching, and the domestic and foreign peaceful atmosphere was intermittently appearing. People's hearts were gradually turning bullish. Most of the sellers were old bulls leaving the market, with very few new shorts. Large buyers were gradually showing strength. Although the future may not soar straight up, at least it is a curved upward trend. Yesterday morning, Defu showed special favor to Class D bonds, with slightly more demand, and the market was uniquely strong. Yu Ru Hongda Hengkang Tongshen also extensively absorbed bonds. Hengfu Yitai also strongly absorbed bonds. Tongkang and Xiekang bullishly left the market. Jiucheng Lianyi also released a lot. Retail investors slightly went short. The market price of Class D bonds suddenly broke through 6 yuan, on par with the market price of Class E bonds. Class B bonds have already broke through 9 yuan. The noon closing price of Class D bonds surged by 0.95 yuan, and the rest were also all good, up 0.25-0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, Tongshun, Hongda, and Hengkang continued to buy. Youfu also came to add to their positions, and Yuxing also collected bonds very eagerly. Lianyi turned bullish. Renfeng also covered their shorts. If it were not for the release of bonds by bullish parties like Xiekang, Dacheng, and Yizhong, Class C bonds would have broken through 8 yuan long ago, and Class B bonds would have a hope of 70 yuan. The situation was very strong. As a result, market prices were up 0.55-1.1 yuan compared to the previous week. Approximately 2.45 million yuan were traded. A brief summary table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 50 shares of Wuzhou Pharmacy shares were traded at a price of 110 yuan each.

The opening price of public utilities stocks rose slightly. There were very few changes throughout the day. Rubber stocks still showed no signs of improvement.

### Yarn and Cotton: Shuangma Opens Futures Trading

The yarn market is revolving towards rising, because the bullish sentiment of the bulls is still firm, so the market is stable. However, spot yarn transactions are not as enthusiastic as before the festival. However, a portion of the market, with Shuangma factory orders, is still not very loose. It may be useful to adopt a bullish strategy when the price falls. Therefore, the market is soft with a hard undertone. It is rumored that Shuangma futures have opened, with the July opening price at 1,380 yuan and the closing price at 1,382 yuan. The August opening price was 1,387 yuan and the closing price was 1,392 yuan. This is calculated based on the spot price of foreign firms, which is nearly 50 yuan different from the price of Shuangma factory orders. Approximately 4,000-5,000 bags were traded. The high price of 20-count Shuangma spot yarn was 1,437 yuan, and the low price was 1,440 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,438 yuan. It was then heard that the price of gold was good, rising to 1,450 yuan. The final price was 1,448-1,449 yuan. Today, 43 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 50 pieces were shipped to Siam. Currently, the yarn market is complex, and future changes are so diverse that people are lost in a fog and do not know where to start.

Shuangma opened in the morning, and the trend was very weak. The public wanted to sell because there was talk that the exchange would open in the near future. The opening price was 1,430 yuan, and scalpers were unanimously selling. It was rumored that the price of the exchange was 1,160 yuan, so the situation was soft, falling to 1,420 yuan. Between these 22-24 yuan, the price fluctuated for a long time. At the same time, trading was not strong. Until around 12:00 PM, it was said that margin increased, and foreign exchange was expected to soften, and buying became strong, and the market turned forward. The closing price was 1,437 yuan. The trading volume during the day was 8,260 bales, of which 260 bales were by Hong Kong merchants and 8,000 bales were by domestic merchants.

### Current Cotton Mill Stomach Blocked

The current cotton shape is still stable. The trend of fine velvet cotton is quite strong, but the factory's stomach has no strong ability to absorb. The number of transactions is not large, and only 100 pieces of Middling cotton were traded at the stack delivery price of 438 yuan, which was a deal between numbers.

In other news, foreign firms in Shanghai rarely purchase foreign cotton, and only transfer and sell it to North China to decorate. However, the foreign cotton market has remained firm, and at the same time, due to the lack of water legs, it is quite inconvenient to transport to Shanghai. The cotton market is firm and stable and is not weakening due to the roundabout yarn market and the temporary wait-and-see attitude of all parties.

The New York cotton market fell due to sales by Southern gangs and long liquidation. Yesterday's closing price was approximately 3-4 pounds lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market is narrow and transactions are weak. The closing price rose slightly by 1-2 rupees. It is predicted that today's opening market will be slightly bullish.

### Piece Goods: Market Sales Still Dim

The cloth market revolved yesterday, because the market price was gradually rising, and the market turned around, but the current sales were dim, and the rising power was still weak. The opening prices of all cloth sales were little changed in the morning. In the afternoon, there was a slight increase. As a result, white goods, fine cloth and twill rose by 0.25-0.5 yuan, coarse cloth rose by 0.25 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth was flat. Local street transactions were over 200 pieces of various cloths. The demand from the Nanyang Gang of customers was still good, selling 200-300 pieces of coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth, etc. The Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs sold nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, etc.

Dongbu cloth fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, and the trend turned firm. The low price of Longtou fine cloth spot delivery was 43.5-43.6 yuan in the morning. Subsequently, due to the rising yarn market, short covering was made, and the pull in the later market was even tighter, rising step by step to 45.4 yuan. The Four Gentlemen serge rose to 1.435 yuan. However, according to the actual situation, customer sales have not yet been launched.

Exports: On the 3rd, 115 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong, 265 pieces were exported to Siam, and 150 pieces were exported to Yantai.

### Paris Again Sees Rise

Summer goods are finally timely goods, and transactions continue daily. The price of Paris cloth, after falling, rebounded by 0.5 yuan per yard. Yesterday, Zhanghua and Yihua brand cloths were sold for 19.5 yuan per yard, Hongsheng single-width cloth was 11.25 yuan, Xie Xin was 25 yuan, Li Xing and Meifa were 26 yuan, Donghuo white serge with double yellow edges was 28 yuan, Yongyu No. 400 was 28.5 yuan, Baofeng riding breeches was 51.5 yuan, and Meifeng plain overcoat was 65 yuan.

### Peanuts (2)

— Gao Jianong

Speaking of how the Portuguese propagated peanuts to Africa, one cannot help but think of a tragic scene that horrified the world, and was also a major stain on human history! The reason they spread peanuts to Africa was not out of goodwill for the black Africans, but rather an accidental result of the "slave trade," a terrifying event filled with countless painful separations and deaths! It was the Portuguese slave traders who intended to use this "longevity" fruit, as they called it, as food for the African black slaves they called "ebony"! Therefore, the reason why the black Africans can now enjoy these exquisite peanuts is really at the cost of the shackles and chains suffered by tens of thousands of "ebony," the whippings and beatings, and the drops of sweat and fresh blood that flowed! Alas, humanity!

How did peanuts spread to China? Who first imported them? I have scoured Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica and Xu Guangqi's Complete Treatise on Agriculture, but I could not find even a single word of record. Then, its arrival in China was certainly later than sweet potatoes and corn. To investigate the truly earliest record of peanuts, it is probably no more than Fang Yizhi's Miscellaneous Records of Physics. In the Dou Fan Bean entry under the Dietary section of this book, it says: "Fan bean, also known as peanut, also known as earth bean. Plant it in February or March, no more than a few seeds in a ridge... Flowers bloom on the vine, and the filaments fall into the soil to form fruit. Dig it out of the soil after winter. The shell has patterns, and the beans are yellowish-white. When stir-fried, it tastes sweet and fragrant like pine nuts..." Fang Yizhi was from Tongcheng. He passed the imperial examination during the Chongzhen reign and was one of the Four Gentlemen of the late Ming Dynasty. After the Ming Dynasty fell in 1644, he cut his hair to become a monk. Therefore, the evidence that is difficult to refute is that peanuts were introduced to China during the transition from the Ming to the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century. According to the records of the Fuqing County Annals of Fujian Province: "Peanuts originally came from foreign countries. In the early years of the Kangxi reign, a monk named Yingyuan went to Fusang (Japan) to find seeds and sent them back..." Hai Bian驳驳驳驳 said: "The Japanese call peanuts Nanjing beans, so it can be seen that the Japanese peanut seeds came from China. The statement in the Fuqing County Annals does not seem credible." I think that even if this matter is credible, it can only be compared to the example of Lin Huaizhen introducing sweet potatoes, and it should be regarded as reaching the same destination by different routes. The ironclad case of Miscellaneous Records of Physics cannot be shaken. As for Wu Qijun's Illustrated Compendium of Plants, quoting Tan Cui's Records of the Yunnan Sea Balance: "Peanuts are the first among the fruits of the South, and their use for the people is the most widespread. During the Song and Yuan dynasties, along with cotton and sweet potatoes, Cantonese merchants obtained them from various countries at sea and planted them in Gui: They called cotton kapok, sweet potatoes yams, and peanuts earth beans, and Yunnan called them peanut pines." As soon as we look at it, we know that it has committed a chronological error and is a presumptuous statement: because the New World had not yet been discovered during the Song and Yuan dynasties, where would the sweet potatoes and peanuts come from? The Illustrated Compendium of Plants also cites: "Nancheng County Annals: commonly called Fan bean, also called land fruit. Ganzhou Annals: peanut, also known as the 'longevity fruit'..." There is also the "Notes of Southern Yue: peanuts... Flowers spit silk, but cannot form pods. The pods are born separately between the roots and stems. Dig it out of the sand. The shell is about an inch long and has wrinkles, with three or four fruits inside, similar to broad beans. The taste is sweet and refreshing, with a slight ginseng smell, also known as flower ginseng..." All of this is excellent historical material. - Now, to sum it all up: Peanuts were introduced to China in the 17th century by the people of Fujian and Guangdong from overseas (the Philippine Islands?), and were first planted in the south, and then spread to the north.

There are Brazilian and Peruvian varieties of peanuts, as mentioned earlier. The Brazilian variety has large grains, while the Peruvian variety has small grains. The first variety to be introduced to China was the small-grained Peruvian variety, which is what ordinary people now call "small peanuts." The large-grained Brazilian variety - which ordinary people simply call peanuts, to contrast with the previous variety, only adding the word "large" - was only transplanted to our country in recent years, and it has a great tendency to completely take the place of the previous variety. I remember a few years ago, an older farmer told me: "Small peanuts are native to China" - of course, he did not know that they were first brought over from overseas - "large peanuts are newly arrived from foreign countries..." Chu Yiran also said in his book on the cultivation of oil crops: "... Later, an American collector introduced the American large-grain variety to Shandong and other areas, and due to its excellent quality and abundant yield, it was eagerly planted. Indeed, more than ten years ago, the peanut market in the north was still a mixture of Peruvian and Brazilian varieties, with equal power. Now, the market is filled only with mountains of large peanuts. Even if small peanuts have not disappeared, they are rare and few. However, in terms of quality, Chu Yiran's words are incorrect. The small peanuts far exceed the large peanuts: small peanuts not only have a particularly exquisite flavor, but also have an oil yield of up to 50%, while large peanuts only have an oil yield of 40%. The reason why large peanuts have the upper hand is only because of their "abundant yield." (To be continued)

### Sugar Market: Abundant Raw Sugar Accumulation, a Precipitous Decline

Since the establishment of forward sugar trading by the Exchange, it has attracted the attention of speculators and hoarders, who have tried their best to absorb the supply. The price of No. 24 raw sugar, for example, rose from 82 yuan to 120 yuan, creating an unprecedented surge. However, informed individuals within the industry have repeatedly warned against this, hoping to moderate the price increase, but to no avail. Based on production costs, the price has been inflated by a significant 20 yuan. Moreover, incoming shipments continue unabated, while actual sales are sluggish, leading to a situation of unmanageable inventory accumulation. Confidence has waned, and selling pressure is strong, resulting in a precipitous price decline. Yesterday, spot prices for No. 2 raw sugar for January arrival were 91.3 yuan, new cargo for April arrival was 94.2 yuan, and for June 10 delivery, the morning opening price was 96.3 yuan, closing at 94.2 yuan. The afternoon opening was 94.2 yuan, closing at 94.8 yuan. For June 20 delivery, the morning price was 98 yuan, closing at 93 yuan, and the afternoon opening was 95.4 yuan, closing at 95.6 yuan. TaiKoo B Mark Puxi stored goods were priced at 103 yuan, with little interest in other brands. There were 6,300 bags of sugar arriving from Hong Kong on the second day.

### Coal and Coal Briquettes: A Bolt from the Blue, 20 Yuan Added to the Wholesale Price, Retail Price Set at 17 Yuan

The coal briquette market had been quiet for a long time. Earlier this month, due to demand exceeding supply, underground trading of warehouse receipts pushed prices as high as 330 yuan. However, as factories maximized supply, the underground market softened by the end of the month, but the factory price remained unchanged at 296 yuan. Unexpectedly, the price reversed course the day before yesterday (the 1st), and the factories claimed that coal dust and water costs had increased significantly, leading to an increase of 20 yuan in the wholesale price among traders. Warehouse receipts for coal briquettes are now 316 yuan per ton, and the retail price at stores is set at 17 yuan per load. However, some stores with existing inventory in this street offer prices that are 4 or 5 cents cheaper. As for the low-priced coal briquettes advertised through broadcasting, they are produced by small factories not affiliated with the association and are not subject to these restrictions.

### Hardware: American Narrow Strip Steel, Price Increased by More Than 10 Yuan

The price of American narrow strip steel has risen by more than 10 yuan in the past few days due to the interruption of supplies from Hong Kong and the limited inventory in Shanghai. Yesterday, the asking price was 335 yuan per 200-pound box (for mixed colors). Selected colors are even scarcer, making it impossible to pick and choose. Trading activity is slow, with only mixed-quality goods being traded in the market. It is reported that canneries, toy factories, printing plants, cigarette tin manufacturers, and hoarders trading among themselves are dealing in quantities of 300 to 500 boxes, boosting market sentiment somewhat.

### Sundries: Rice in Burlap Bags, Demand is Active

The demand for burlap bags is noticeably active recently due to rice packaging needs in Siam and other places. New bags are relatively tight in supply, with prices rising by 10 to 20 cents. Other items, such as Indian burlap (per 1,000 yards), have risen by 30 yuan, and domestic Hangzhou burlap (per piece) has rebounded by 5 yuan. Burlap (per 1,000 bolts) has increased by 100 to 200 yuan. The detailed market prices for various categories are listed below:

Category (Price per 1,000 pieces)

2.5 lb New Green Warp: 63.00

2.25 lb New Green Warp: 57.00

Hong Kong Washed New Green Warp: 55.00

Local New Green Warp: 53.00

No. 2 Green Warp: 45.00

### Shanghai Summer School Enrollment

During the summer vacation, many major middle schools and universities run summer schools, but they are all designed for current students. A summer school to prepare high school graduates for university entrance exams is rare. In view of this, alumni of various universities have prepared the Shanghai Summer School and established a college preparatory class to provide systematic review for those taking university entrance exams and guide them in the ways of taking the exams. It is reported that the school is now ready and has invited famous university professors and middle school principals as consultants. It has also gathered more than 80 professors, assistant teachers, recent graduates, and senior students from 16 schools including Shanghai Medical College, Jiaotong, Datong, Tongji, Tongde, Guanghua, Soochow, Ginling, Concord, St. John's, Lester, Jinan, Hujiang, Aurora, Yenching, and others to serve in the school. All of them are young and excellent and happy to associate with younger students, using friendship to increase interest in learning. This is the school's characteristic. The school address is temporarily borrowed from the Jinye Vocational School on Wangjia Sha East, Baker Road. The location is central and the school buildings are spacious. Enrollment has now begun.

### How to Study Zoology (4)

— Yuan Shanzheng

(8) Reproduction Methods

A. The structure and function of animal male and female reproductive organs.

B. Asexual reproduction includes fission and budding. Sexual reproduction includes bisexual and unisexual reproduction, and the phenomenon of alternating generations.

(9) Adaptation

The form and nature of animals often change due to the influence of the environment in order to adapt to the external environment and maintain survival forever. The most obvious examples are protective coloration, warning coloration, mimicry, symbiosis, and parasitism.

(10) Heredity and Variation

The transmission of parental traits of animals, where the traits are similar to each other, is called heredity. However, there are cases where, during the formation of sperm and egg cells in germ cells, special things happen, resulting in special sperm and eggs, or the fertilized egg is affected by external things after combination, resulting in variation.

(11) Animal Evolution

In 1859, Darwin published "On the Origin of Species," explaining with facts that all animals evolved gradually from a common ancestor. The current complex species evolved and separated from simple species. Now, animal evolution is further proven in terms of anatomy, development, fossils, distribution, and biochemistry.

(12) The Position of Humans in the Animal Kingdom

Humans and anthropoid apes have many similarities and belong to the phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Primates, suborder Haplorhini. Therefore, humans and anthropoid apes come from the same source, but they have evolved in different ways. One branch is humans, and the other branch is anthropoid apes.

(13) The Relationship between Animals and Plants

A. Spreading pollen to help plants with fertilization.

B. Excreting carbon dioxide for plants to use in photosynthesis.

C. Excreting urine and feces as fertilizer for plants.

D. Directly and indirectly harmful to plants.

C. Research Examples

A. Observation and Research

Studying zoology is not limited to schools and classrooms. The natural environment can be studied and observed anytime and anywhere. Taking Shanghai as an example, Zhaofeng Park, French Park, the Great World, the zoo of the circus, as well as Wuhang and insect stalls are all good places for investigation and research. From these places, one can acquire practical knowledge of the morphology, physiological functions, and living conditions of many animals. If there are opportunities for visits and travel, that is even more of an opportunity to find new materials.

### Horses and Chickens

— Xiao Yun

When automobiles first appeared on the roads in America, the horses pulling carts were greatly frightened. Many of them stopped in the middle of the road and refused to move a step. Later, after getting used to these "monsters," they became indifferent, but they have already been eliminated by the "monsters."

Recently, the owner of a chicken farm in Monrovia, California, USA, is negotiating with local authorities to apply for a ban on airplanes near the chicken farm. Because many hens, seeing these "monsters," refuse to squat down to lay eggs and just stand all day.

Humans are sometimes like this. Our conservative character makes us unaccustomed to new things and makes us oppose new ideas. However, the progress of the times is not lenient. It does not stagnate because of our conservatism. On the contrary, it will leap forward regardless of everything. Our only option is not to bury our heads in the sand or turn a blind eye, nor is it to protest or oppose, but to open our eyes, recognize new things, new ideas, new times, and follow it to progress. Other actions are futile. People should be a little smarter than horses and chickens.

### Air Force Carrier Pigeons

— Revision and Supplement

Believe it or not, when British Air Force planes fly to Germany or German-occupied areas to bomb, they not only carry deadly bombs, but also carry pigeons symbolizing peace. Those pigeons are military carrier pigeons, which can make up for the shortcomings of new-style military supplies and have actually saved many lives. Originally, the Air Force soldiers relied on the wireless radio on the plane to communicate with the headquarters of the home country, but once the wireless radio failed—this kind of thing is very common under the artillery fire of the enemy—wouldn't they be at a loss? Sometimes they drift at sea, sometimes they are trapped on a desert island, so they have to use those carrier pigeons. Sensitive carrier pigeons will fly back to England and convey the news of the unfortunate soldiers to the headquarters. Military agencies that defend the country, sometimes because the air raids are fierce, cannot use the usual communication tools, so they also release carrier pigeons to transmit military messages.

The London government has regarded the pigeons of peace as "defenders of the country." All 100,000 pigeons in the national pigeon farm have long been ordered to serve the country. All pigeon vendors in the country are stocking "reserve soldiers" of more than one million, all of whom have registered with the government and are willing to have all their carrier pigeons dispatched by the government. The government also installed telephones for them at their own expense so that they could immediately report emergency messages brought back from the front line to the government.

In the past, the British government did not allow people to shoot and capture old eagles, but now, regardless of old eagles or young eagles, they are all killed without question. The government also advises people not to be greedy for pleasure and kill pigeons to fill their stomachs. The official said in a formal document: "At present, meat is subject to control, and the value of pigeons is only about one shilling, but the messages transmitted by this kind of poultry are related to the lives of the air force soldiers of our country!" Gluttons who ignore this document shall be fined 100 yuan or imprisoned for three months, which shows how much the government values pigeons.

The National Pigeon Farm trains a large number of carrier pigeons so that they can fly 600 miles across the sea and land. Recently, a carrier pigeon actually flew from Xiznei to New York, a distance of 3,000 miles, taking 15 months. In short-distance "voyages," carrier pigeons can maintain a speed of one mile per minute with the help of the wind. However, in long-distance flights, the average speed is 35 to 40 miles per hour. Pigeon vendors sometimes use ingenious methods to train carrier pigeons. Incubating female pigeons, due to the instinct of maternal love, hurriedly fly back to the original place. Two weeks after the young pigeons hatch, male pigeons miss their homes and will desperately fly back. Heterosexual pigeons miss each other very much after being separated for a few days, so they are eager to reunite. These are the reasons why carrier pigeons increase their speed on the return journey.

When each carrier pigeon "serves in active duty," its feet are tied with metal tubes. There is a blank space on the surface of the tube for writing urgent documents. Longer documents that can be written calmly can be hidden inside the tube.

It is not an easy task for pilots to release pigeons in flight, because the wind force at high altitudes often reaches more than 300 miles per hour. If the pilot releases them carelessly, the weak life cannot withstand the strong wind. The safest way is to wrap the pigeon in newspaper and fold its wings tightly on both sides. After the newspaper breaks open in the air, they can flap their wings and fly away.

How do carrier pigeons have the ability to transmit messages? There is still no satisfactory answer to this question. Some people say that this is entirely instinct, because they are timid, do not like loneliness, and are willing to reunite with their parents and children. Sunlight and smell do not affect them. A more credible theory is that the magnetic force of the ground allows them to recognize the way home. When radio stations broadcast, pigeons cannot identify directions around it, and when there is lightning in the air, pigeons cannot tell east from west.

(8) Palpable Friendship

"I know this, but has Seventh Master been released yet?" Zhao Si told him not to be impatient, but today Yu Kun was particularly impatient.

"Originally, everyone said that with his money and power, at most one court session would be enough; who knew that three days ago, the verdict came down, and that bastard dog official actually sentenced him to sixteen months; isn't that infuriating? The strangest thing is that Third Master is his uncle and currently a famous military leader, yet he doesn't think of a way to bail him out!" Yu Kun said, finally understanding. "Very good!" When people reach a point of helplessness, they often say things that even they themselves can't explain.

Zhao Si suddenly stood up and handed Yu Kun two sheets of paper filled with writing that had been pressed under an inkstone.

"These past few days, I've been carefully taking stock at home. Aside from debts owed to or by others that I'm not very clear about, everything else, whether valuable or not, I've listed it all!" He said as he walked back and forth in the room. "You can double-check it in a little while."

Unexpectedly, Yu Kun didn't even look and stuffed the two sheets of paper into his pocket.

"No hurry, that's a minor matter. It's best if we go visit Seventh Master first. Third Master still has a few words he wants me to relay to him." Before he finished speaking, he had already stood up from his seat. "Fourth Master, would you please accompany me on a trip now?"

"Why not!" Zhao Si replied without hesitation, but when he looked at the sunlight outside the window, he couldn't help but frown immediately, because fat people are all afraid of the heat.

Yu Kun was only thinking about seeing Yuan Shaowen and didn't care whether he was afraid of the heat or not. He immediately urged him to put on a long gown, instructed the two elderly servants left at home, and hurried out the door with him.

"Which way is it?" Once at the gate, as he was about to call for a car, Yu Kun realized he should ask first. (122)

Invention

### Wireless Telegraph Paper

— Ke Zhong

The United States in New York recently conducted an experiment with wireless telegraph paper, and it is expected that it may soon become a reality. The method is the same as wireless broadcasting. The only difference is one is broadcasting sound, and the other is broadcasting paper (i.e., text and photos). In the future, anyone who has a "wireless receiver" at home can pull out a newspaper from the machine every morning, the content of which is exactly the same as what is issued by the "wireless telegraph office." This is truly a miracle of the scientific world, seeking the advancement of the human lifestyle. It's not for personal report cards and degrees, but to seek social transformation and happiness.

A true college student should have a beautiful soul, and not just a beautiful appearance. But that doesn't mean that an unattractive appearance necessarily has a beautiful soul; nor does it necessarily mean that someone with a beautiful appearance has an ugly soul. Only those who forget themselves, sincerely love others, help others, and study and use knowledge for justice, for the happiness and enlightenment of humanity, and strive tirelessly, have a truly beautiful soul.

Because a segment of female students need beautiful souls, therefore I said these words to summon their souls:

Soul, return! Heaven endowed you with your essence, why do you need flamboyant makeup? People can be deceived, but Heaven cannot be deceived!

Soul, return, empty words cannot be entrusted, facts speak louder than eloquence, don't say one thing and do another.

Soul, return, superficial writing cannot be entrusted, "to believe everything written in books is worse than having no books at all."

Return, return! The magnificent landscape is certainly not found in dead medical books, but in a lively mind that integrates knowledge.

Return, return! The myriad living beings are not found on lips or nails painted with rouge, but in hard work and seeking truth from facts. Soul, return!

(Editor's note: Mr. Cang Su's writing this article to summon the souls of some female university students in Shanghai is certainly a great virtue. However, summoning only the souls of female students without summoning the souls of some male students is somewhat biased in favor of women and against men, so we have added a sentence: "Souls of male university students, please also return together!")

### Summoning the Souls of Female University Students

— Cang Su

Reading Ms. Ying's "I Don't Seem Like a College Student" on May 10th gave me a very deep impression, not only because it reflects a corrupt aspect of isolated education, but also because it expresses our questions about the words "college student."

What kind of "college student" does Ms. Ying describe in her small portrait? It's those who wear heavy makeup, lipstick, and nail polish, who only know how to decorate themselves and enjoy themselves all day long, who don't study, but who are just some people flaunting the "college student" brand. Can these people represent "college students"? Of course not.

I believe that a college student should at least be: not only learning a specialized skill and academic knowledge, but also cultivating a noble personality suitable for community life, having a correct understanding of culture, collectively researching and working, pursuing the spirit of truth from facts, having sincere and unhypocritical, practical and unexaggerated words and deeds, not memorizing formulas and notes, but applying scientific methods.

### The Words of Money

— Xing Zhi

Those who cannot enjoy true happiness devote all their energy to money. Schopenhauer: Give way three parts of profit, a step back is a step forward; do a few good deeds, and scattering wealth can accumulate wealth.—Philosophical Saying.

Money is a faithful servant, a tyrannical master.—Bouheurs

### An Interview with Qilin Tong

— Zhou Ziyu

After the famous actor Zhou Xinfang reported that he would be taking a break from performing on May 6th for health reasons, the Haixing Society reported, "Mr. Zhou's rest period may be extended, and even now, the date of his return to the stage cannot be determined, as it is not simply a health issue." Now that Yan Jupeng's performance period has ended, and after the transition between the "China Travel" and film companies, Mr. Zhou will continue to rest. The performers will be the Pingjiao Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia sisters. Furthermore, the theater may follow in the footsteps of Huang Jinrong and exclusively invite Pingjiao performers. As for Huang Jinrong's invitation to Zhang Eyun, it has not been discussed recently.

I have learned that after Yan Jupeng stopped performing, the Carlton Grand Theater will also invite famous Peking Opera actors from Beiping. The first group of new actors invited are the Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia sisters. Dongming studies the laosheng (old male) role and is a protégé of the late veteran actor Cai Yuting (Cai was Ma Lianliang's teacher). Dongxia is a qingyi and huadan (female) role, her art taught by famous teachers and once a student of Xun Huisheng. Her appearance is extremely beautiful, and her voice is a gift from heaven, a rising star among female actors. The wusheng (male military) role is Wang Zhongchen, the xiaosheng (young male) role is Zhou Weijun, the chou (clown) role is Guan Shengji, and the hualian (painted face) role will be borrowed from Huang Jinrong: Qiu Shengrong. They have already departed from Beiping to the south and are expected to appear on stage in about ten days. In addition to Zhou Xinfang and Wang Xichun, the other members of the original Yifeng Society at the Carlton Theater will continue to perform as usual.

Passing by Mr. Zhou Xinfang's residence by chance, I couldn't help but think of the contemporary red actor who hadn't performed in a long time. Eager to know a little about Mr. Zhou's recent situation, I was happy to make a personal visit out of friendship.

After gently knocking on the gate twice, a male servant opened the door and asked us our business. After Mr. Xue Weihan handed him a card, Mr. Zhou came to the gate himself not long after, expressing a warm welcome.

After a pleasant handshake, Mr. Zhou politely led us to sit down in an elegantly furnished living room. After exchanging greetings, our conversation officially began.

Mr. Xue: "Mr. Zhou, I heard that your recent rest is related to your health. Is that correct?"

Mr. Zhou: "Indeed, it's because I haven't recovered from the sequelae of a lung ailment. My body is quite weak. The doctor said that it's not suitable to perform continuously and that I must rest for a while. It just so happened that Mr. Yan Jupeng came south, so I'm taking this opportunity to recuperate."

Mr. Xue: "In that case, Mr. Zhou will return to the stage after Mr. Yan returns north?"

Mr. Zhou: "No, I need a longer period of rest. After Mr. Yan returns north, I may have to ask someone else to take my place on stage."

Mr. Xue: "Then when will Mr. Zhou be able to return to the stage?" Mr. Zhou: "I'm afraid... I need at least one or two months of rest. If possible, maybe I'll postpone my return to the stage until autumn."

Mr. Xue: "Will Mr. Zhou decline all outside social engagements during your break?"

Mr. Zhou: "Yes, there are many outside social engagements. Some invite me to dine, and others ask me to perform in charity shows. Although I really want to participate, it's difficult to fulfill my wishes in reality."

This Writer: "Does Miss Wang Xichun also need a long-term break?"

Mr. Zhou: "Of course, she also needs a long-term break to avoid the effects of too much work on her health."

This Writer: "Although Mr. Zhou's health is not good, you seem to be in good spirits."

Mr. Zhou: "That's because we had a good chat, and I'm excited!"

Mr. Xue: "Mr. Zhou has spent a long time with us, and I'm afraid you're very tired. We would like to take our leave now."

At this point, we bid farewell to Mr. Zhou, and he politely escorted us out the door.

### Two Celebrity Couples are About to Divorce

— Hui Lin

Two divorce rumors have recently been circulating in Hollywood, and they may become reality. One is that the dashing young man Robert Taylor is about to divorce his wife, Barbara Stanwyck, both of whom are famous movie stars. The other is that the shy star Gary Cooper and his wife have also had a falling out and are said to be about to divorce as well. However, people hope that both of these news stories are fictional. In Hollywood, marriage and divorce are fickle matters, but the breakup of these two celebrity couples is somewhat unpleasant.

Chapter Ten The First Glimpse of Gongsun's Swordplay

Sang Yiqing was crying with a gloomy face, not saying a word. Wang Yongtai then said to Xu Jing, "Now I understand everything. This enchanting woman is inherently licentious and cannot stay still. I shouldn't have married her. And this thief named Sang, I shouldn't have allowed him to stay in my house, letting them do such beastly things. Won't people secretly call me a senile fool? I am also very sorry for my virtuous nephew. I mistakenly believed the words of a despicable woman and regarded a good person as a bad person. Luckily, my virtuous nephew came here and caught this pair of dogs, man and woman, for me. I will never spare them. How do you think I should deal with them?" Xu Jing laughed coldly, saying, "There's no point in keeping them alive. Uncle, do whatever you want. I only ask that the injustice I suffered last time be cleared up." Wang Yongtai said, "Okay, I will definitely not let these two live in the world and be disgraced. Since they are so fond of each other, let them go to the underworld to live together. For now, let them live a little longer and deal with them slowly. But there's one more thing I want to ask my virtuous nephew: although you came here very quickly to catch this pair of dogs, man and woman, for me, I don't know if you have lost anything valuable?" Wang Yongtai's words reminded Xu Jing, and he remembered the precious sword on his back, and his heart couldn't help but jump. His Crimson Phoenix Sword was stolen; how would Wang Yongtai know about this? Strange, strange! Could it be that he is deliberately playing games with me? But that's not necessarily the case; first, he would never have known that I was coming here and tease me; second, he only found out about the affair between He Ji and Sang Yiqing tonight, otherwise, why didn't he go straight to his own building and deal with the adulterer and adulteress? Xu Jing stared blankly, thinking, unable to guess the reason. Wang Yongtai couldn't help but say to him again, "Has your virtuous nephew's Crimson Phoenix Sword been stolen?" Xu Jing could only say at this time, "Yes, this matter is strange. The Crimson Phoenix Sword on my back was suddenly stolen, and I couldn't catch up. I'm very ashamed. But how did Uncle know beforehand? I am confused and don't understand the truth. Uncle knows, please tell me. Also, what I can't understand is that since you didn't know about the adultery, and tonight is the night you keep the precept, how would you come upstairs yourself at this time? I don't think it's a coincidence, right? Please show me, Uncle." (79)

### An Outline of the Philosophy of Practical Action

— Zong Yu

The result of the commodification of labor is that the less work the better, the higher the price the better, and the collective and the individual become opposed. If this continues to the extreme, the collective is finished, and the individual is also finished. Therefore, the commodification of labor should be opposed.

### Symphony of Drama and Film

— Bai Ding

Actors Liu Qiong, Mei Xi, and director Yue Feng, among others, of the Guolian Company have organized the Guolian Basketball Team and often practice in the sports field specially built by the Guolian authorities. Their performance is very good. The Tiemat Basketball Team (jointly formed by members of the Guohua Company and staff of the Family Industry Society) recently competed with Guolian. Both sides deployed their most elite units. As a result, Guolian won by a score of sixty-nine to thirty-three.

Wu Yonggang's work after "Tears of Blood in the Iron Window" has been decided to be "Dragon Versus Tiger," which is also aimed at satirizing the current society. The entire theme is very serious. Liu Qiong and Wang Yin, who are good at hard-line style, have been specially invited to co-star.

The Huasheng Troupe's public performance of "Yue Fei" will not be abandoned because Wu Yonggang, Liu Qiong, Chen Qi, etc., refuse to direct or perform. Su Shi has been specially invited to direct, Huang He to play Yue Fei, and Wang Xianzai to play Qin Hui, and Sun Jinglu to play Yinping. Others including Zhou Chu and Qiao Qi are also participating in the collaboration. Rehearsals have been held in the Meicheng Photography Factory for several days.
