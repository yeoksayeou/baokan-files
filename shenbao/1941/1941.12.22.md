Havas News Agency, Washington, 20th: President Roosevelt today appointed Admiral Ernest King, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet, as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy. All Atlantic, Pacific, and Asiatic Fleets will be under his supreme command. He will also be responsible for the defense of the coast and frontiers, reporting only to President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox. The position of Commander of the Atlantic Fleet, which he vacates, will be succeeded by Rear-Admiral Royal Ingersoll.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 21st: Political observers here have stated that Admiral King is an aviation expert. His appointment to this important position is crucial for the future development of American strategy. Admiral King, who is sixty-seven years old, is known as the "Eagle" in the U.S. Navy. He participated in the Spanish-American War and the last World War, serving as commander of submarines and the Navy's air force.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 21st: General King has now been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet. King was originally the Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. When British Prime Minister Churchill and U.S. President Roosevelt held the Atlantic Conference on the recently sunk British battleship "Prince of Wales," King also participated in his capacity as Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.

Reuters, Washington, 21st: The U.S. Navy Department announced that "defense sea areas" have been established near thirteen important harbors and waterways on the east and west coasts of the United States. Navigation within these areas will be under the supervision of the Navy. Maritime authorities have warned ships to navigate within these areas only during daylight hours. The designated areas include Portland in Maine, Portsmouth in New Hampshire, Boston in Massachusetts, Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, San Diego and San Francisco in California, and the mouth of the Columbia River in Washington State. The coast of the Jantzen Beach area, the port of Puget Sound, New York Harbor, New London, and Delaware Bay are also included.

### Britain to Establish Operational Committee in the Far East; Pledges Utmost Effort to Defend Malaya and Australia; Sino-British Military Cooperation Running Smoothly

Reuters, Singapore, 20th: The British government will establish a Far East Operational Committee, chaired by Duff Cooper, the British representative in the Far East. Its organization may include two commanders-in-chief, the Governor, representatives from the Australian government, and Sir Sansom, former commercial counselor at the British Embassy in Japan. Sir Sansom was recently transferred to the Economic Warfare Department to direct propaganda work in Malaya from Singapore.

Havas News Agency, Singapore, 20th: Officials have announced that the "Far East Military Conference" is scheduled to be held here today and tomorrow. It will be chaired by Duff Cooper, British Cabinet Minister stationed in Singapore. In addition to the British Far East land and sea commanders, attendees will include the Governor of the Straits Settlements, representatives from the Australian Commonwealth government, and Sir Sansom. Sir Sansom previously served as a commercial counselor at the British Embassy in Japan for many years until he was recently transferred to the Economic Warfare Department, responsible for handling commercial issues between Singapore and Malaya.

Havas News Agency, London, 20th: Reuters issued an official statement stating, "The situation in Malaya remains extremely serious. Japanese forces have occupied the area northwest of Malaya, near Penang Island, making the defense of the island impossible. The fall of the island is strategically important and will greatly benefit the Japanese, who can now block the Strait of Malacca, or at least control maritime traffic in the strait, and use Penang as a base to disrupt British commercial shipping in the Indian Ocean. Singapore, Rangoon, Sumatra, and the Burmese coast will also be threatened. Furthermore, if the rubber plantations in Malaya are not destroyed in advance, they will be occupied by the Japanese, seriously impacting Britain's rubber supply. It is undeniable that the threat to the port of Singapore is increasing daily, but we are determined to resist to the end at any cost. To defend Singapore, we must establish a strong air force. We must understand that the importance of the Pacific War is no different from the beginning of the German-Soviet War. Thanks to the efforts of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, a naval base has been established in Rangoon, and British troops are being sent there in a steady stream before being deployed to the Thai border. At the same time, Chinese troops will also fight alongside us near Burma and Guangzhou-Kowloon. Since the British Cabinet appointed Duff Cooper as its representative to the Far East, the British War Cabinet is now considering setting up a small war cabinet in Singapore. This organization will be responsible for administering the local area and commanding British forces in the Pacific Theater, a development that has long been desired. If it is established, the Australian Commonwealth will also send representatives to participate, as Australia's safety is closely linked to the fate of Singapore."

### The Soviet Union and Christianity (II)

That important moment of the evening arrived, Stalin stood up, raised his glass to the portrait of President Roosevelt hanging in the hall, and said in Russian: "May God help his work."

Umansky, the former Soviet ambassador to the United States, translated what Stalin said into English, and several British and American dignitaries showed surprised expressions on their faces, asking their Russian neighbors whether Umansky's translation was correct, and they all replied that the translation was indeed correct.

Why did Stalin invoke the name of God? The Soviet leader had been educated by an Orthodox priest, and often quoted biblical or religious phrases, even more so than Lenin. However, all the representatives admitted that a politician like Stalin would never say such a thing without thought.

American religious organizations and isolationists opposed Russia, citing the Soviet Union's persecution of religion as a reason. President Roosevelt was even attacked by them for saying that the Soviet Constitution guarantees freedom of religion.

Therefore, Stalin's toast was aimed at the United States, but not at the American public. Soviet officials did not want to notify American journalists of this, in fact, at this time, they certainly did not want a group of journalists to have any record of the religious issue.

Stalin's purpose seemed to be directly at President Roosevelt. He knew that the American representatives would tell the president about his toast. He knew that President Roosevelt often went to church and often involved religion in his speeches. He also knew that President Roosevelt had defended the Soviet Union against attacks from religious organizations, which caused him to be criticized.

Therefore, Stalin seemed to be letting his friends in Washington know that there was actually no prejudice against God or religion in the Kremlin, so that President Roosevelt could continue to defend the Soviet Union without feeling guilty. At least that's the explanation that several representatives were able to get.

Stalin's sideburns were gradually streaked with gray‚Äîsome representatives said they were turning white. They couldn't help but find it strange that he was only five feet six or seven inches tall.

Although Stalin was already sixty-three years old, he was still strong and energetic, working long hours every day. He usually started seeing guests at six in the morning. Soviet newspapers often reported that an inventor, scientist, or factory manager went to the Kremlin after midnight to receive congratulations from Stalin for their perfect work. He seemed to often sit at his desk all night working.

Stalin had a strong memory and could discuss technical matters with experts. Rapplekin, Beaverbrook, and Harriman found that he could discuss the latest types of artillery, tanks, and aircraft in detail.

Stalin wasn't a bumpkin. Even though he had a million things to do every day, he still had time to read. The Soviet leader could rattle off the modern literature of England, Germany, and France like a family heirloom. He once had an hour-long conversation with Leon Feuchtwanger several years ago, and he understood modern literary trends so well that Mr. Feuchtwanger was amazed.

In wartime, propaganda on both sides inevitably exaggerates morality and exaggerates the divine right, which is inevitable. Therefore, in the last World War, the British side issued the cry of "God Save the King," and Germany responded with the appeals of "God Punish England" and "God Save Our People."

Although Russia has long been under a pragmatic system, its leaders openly professed atheism, and avoided the so-called "church that blocks the path of intellectual development" like the plague, which is in sharp contrast to her propaganda of praying to heaven for protection today. Moscow is not satisfied with this change of attitude, which can be seen in Article 124 of the 1938 Stalin Constitution - separation of politics and religion, separation of schools and religion, recognition of freedom of religious belief, and freedom of anti-religious propaganda for the people.

### Coal Plants and Charcoal Shops Are Not Allowed to Refuse to Sell Fuel; Violators Will Be Punished Under the Crime of Endangering Public Security; Transportation Permits Are Limited to Use North of the Suzhou Creek

Yesterday, there were rumors in the coal market that the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council had agreed on concrete measures regarding the supply of coal in the city, including: 1. All market transactions, whether for bituminous coal, anthracite, coal blocks, or dross, are limited to spot goods. 2. The prices of all transactions concluded in the market thereafter must not be deliberately exceeded. If the holder of the goods refuses to release them at the price, anyone can directly report to the coal management committee of the two municipal councils, so that they can be investigated and punished according to law, or have their business license revoked, or be punished as endangering public security, or be deported.

Fuel Stocks Must Be Released on Schedule

Stocks of coal must be released within the date specified by the two municipal councils and must not be violated. 3. Permits must be obtained for the transportation of any quality of coal. Any free transportation will be treated as smuggling and confiscated, or punished by other methods. 4. All coal and charcoal shops selling bituminous coal, anthracite, coal balls, charcoal, and other related fuels at the storefront must sell them at the prescribed prices. Anyone who has goods but refuses to sell them at the price will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. It is also learned that yesterday, various coal and charcoal shops continued to deliver goods to the relevant coal ball factories for sale at the storefronts immediately. The coal ball transportation permits issued by the two authorities are limited to retail stores north of the Suzhou Creek within the British and French Concessions, which can be sold by coal ball factories in Hongkou.

### Registration of Silver, Money, and Pawned Goods Deadline

Although the United Office of the Silver and Money Industry was closed yesterday for a regular holiday, it still worked as usual, especially in handling the registration of the names and quantities of pawned goods from various banks and shops, which was even busier. Because the deadline for this registration is today, the time required to urge and collect registration forms is very insufficient.

### Sales Reporting Required for Hardware and Iron Businesses

All hardware and iron businesses, which had previously temporarily ceased operations, have uniformly resumed business from the day before yesterday. The industry has been greatly affected due to the current situation. In this port, most major construction projects have now been halted, and the demand for hardware and iron materials related to construction engineering has reached a near-dead end. Moreover, various large and small factories in this city have suspended or reduced operations due to the shortage of raw materials. The demand for hardware and iron materials related to machinery is temporarily deemed unnecessary. Therefore, although the market prices of goods in stock for these businesses are high, actual sales are practically non-existent. Stockpilers, facing tight credit, will inevitably lower prices to sell. In the future, commodity prices will also trend downward. After the resumption of business by these firms, they were further instructed to apply for registration of the types and quantities of their inventory for record-keeping. The procedure is the same as for the registration of other materials. It is heard that after registration, if goods are sold, reports must also be submitted promptly. Currently, all firms have already declared in accordance with the regulations.

### Measures to Increase National Food Reserves:  Efforts to Dredge Rice Transport, Chartering Neutral Ships to Transport Vietnamese Rice; Prices of Fish, Meat, and Vegetables Have Been Agreed Upon

According to sources from the Rice Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the committee is currently in consultation with the Japanese authorities to increase the national food reserves and quickly alleviate the panic over rice. The plan is to dredge the supply of Vietnamese rice within a short period, allowing rice merchants to purchase in large quantities and transport it to Shanghai for regulation. Sources responsible for the committee also stated that the committee will also be responsible for chartering neutral ships for rice transport, and special preferential treatment will be given to water transport costs and freight.

Wuhu Rice Agreed

It is learned that two million dan of Wuhu rice have been agreed upon, ready to provide food for the people along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Shanghai can also be allocated some, but the specific allocation number is unknown. The future selling price is planned to be a flat rate of 100 yuan in legal tender per dan. The proposal to restore free trade in rice and grain has also been mentioned. If a proper and practical approach can be followed, the authorities will study it to avoid the drawbacks of crowding when buying rice.

Rice Warehouses Continue to Open

The Taikoo warehouse number 14, facing the New Kai River, reopened yesterday after releasing rice the day before. The number 2 warehouse along the Bund was opened. Rice shops are moving the foreign rice allocated by the Municipal Council to sell at the door. However, the foreign rice stored in the warehouse yesterday was not released in its entirety. The Maotai warehouse on Baike Road and the Xinyuan warehouse on Xiamen Road also opened as usual yesterday. The number of people sent by the rice shops to carry the rice with the Municipal Council's transport permits was numerous at the Taikoo number 2 warehouse. The total amount of rice released from the three warehouses yesterday is unknown as it has not been tallied, but the number is not small, sufficient to supply the door sales of the rice shops. It is also learned that the remaining stored foreign rice will be opened in all warehouses in order, so there should be no shortage in the supply of food for the people.

Peddling National Rice

In the areas near Shanghai's four suburbs, there are many people who transport one to several dou of national rice in bags to peddle in the concession area, and the quantity is gradually increasing, which is beneficial to the regulation of food for the people at a time when rice shops are crowded with purchases.

Fish and Meat Price Fixing

The prices of fish, meat, and vegetables are currently being jointly negotiated by the authorities of the two concessions and the Japanese authorities. All stores selling them will operate according to the announcement. Those who dare to deliberately violate it will be severely punished without leniency. The calculated prices are: Fresh meat, 4 yuan per pound; Fresh fish, 2.4 yuan per pound; Cabbage, 0.25 yuan per pound; Vegetables, 0.1 yuan per pound.

### Timber Sales Stagnant, Prices Trend Downward; Construction Gradually Stalling

Since the 8th of this month, the timber industry has also been greatly impacted by the current situation. The market in this industry was once closed for two days, and then it quickly returned to normal. It was learned yesterday that the market prices of various foreign timber goods have slightly decreased due to sluggish sales and stalled construction. This is not because the raw materials come from the United States, which will be completely cut off in the future, but the market is firm and people are also weak. In the past ten days, the price of various grades of foreign pine has fallen by 100 to 200 yuan. The number of transactions in the market has been very few after the resumption of business. It is also reported that some firms in the industry have already completed orders for foreign pine and Russian spruce from the United States, and now various foreign firms have notified that the arrival of goods is indefinite, which will cause significant losses.

### Foreign Exchange Drafts to Be Restored, Withdrawal Limits for Demand Deposits to Be Increased

According to sources from the Savings and Remittance Bureau, the public has been extremely inconvenienced since the suspension of exchange drafts from other ports to Shanghai. The bureau has consulted with the Remittance Office of the Shanghai Postal Administration, and it will be restored within this week. The withdrawal limit for demand deposits is also being considered for increase.

### Announcement to the Public by the Japanese Military Police Commander

The Japanese Military Police Commander issued an announcement to the Chinese public, the content of which roughly stated that it is regrettable that people inside and outside the concession are devising malicious tactics regarding the rights and interests of enemy countries, or are driven by self-interest and greed, attempting to transport prohibited goods out of the concession, and are gradually spreading malicious rumors, creating anxiety among the people, and planning to expand the power of one party or faction. In the past, warnings were issued to Japanese residents that those who violate military regulations and laws, or harm the morality of the Japanese Empire, will be severely punished without leniency. Now, the same hope is extended to all Chinese citizens, that they exercise prudence and caution, and cooperate to maintain the peace and order of Greater Shanghai. Those who violate military regulations and laws will be severely punished. This announcement.

### Winter Solstice Today, Abnormally Warm Weather

Today is the Winter Solstice. The season has deeply entered mid-winter, but the weather is very warm, suitable for wearing single-layer clothing. This abnormal weather is a cause for concern for spring plowing next year, as it is insufficient to kill hibernating insects. Also, there was heavy fog yesterday morning, which greatly hindered traffic. It took a long time for it to dissipate.

### Tongren No. 2 Hospital Adds Private Beds

### Records of Lectures at the Rongwu Society

The first lecture of the 28th term of the Rongwu Jingjing Society's Yijing (Book of Changes) course, by Yang Zhenru, was titled "Naming the Eight Essentials for Entering the Zhouyi (Book of Changes)." What is the Zhouyi? Yi is the name of the classic, and Zhou is the name of the dynasty. As Kong Zhongda said, "The Zhouyi of Zhou is like the Zhou Shu (Book of Zhou) and Zhou Li (Rites of Zhou), named Zhou to distinguish it from other dynasties." However, the Lian Shan and Gui Zang, which preceded the Zhou dynasty, no longer exist. The Yi that followed the Zhou dynasty, followed the Zhou dynasty in one aspect, it is not like the historical records, law, or method, which differ in their systems. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to name the Yi Zhou to distinguish it from other dynasties. Why is it still called the Zhouyi? Zheng Kangcheng's note on the Zhou Li Sanyi said: "The Lian Shan is like the clouds coming out of the mountains, continuously without end. The Gui Zang means that all things return and are stored within it. The Zhouyi means that the way of Yi is universal, without anything lacking." From this, we know that the Zhou of Zhouyi has a meaning besides distinguishing it from other dynasties. Now, this meaning is even more obvious because there is no need to distinguish it from other dynasties. Let us expand on Kangcheng's meaning and say that the Yi contains three meanings and the Zhou has three virtues. The three meanings are: 1. Unchanging: The Commentary says, "Heaven is honored, earth is humble, Qian and Kun are determined." 2. Changing: The Commentary says, "Movement and stillness have their constants, but change is appropriate." 3. Simple: The Commentary says, "Qian is easy to know, and Kun is simple to do." The three virtues are: 1. Comprehensive and complete: The Commentary says, "Encompassing heaven and earth, knowing all things." 2. Flowing and interconnected: The Commentary says, "Flowing up and down, subtly accomplishing everything." 3. Precise and profound: The Commentary says, "Exhaustively studying the depths, cleansing the heart and storing secrets." What is the door? The Commentary says, "Qian and Kun are the door of the Yi." What is entry? The Commentary says, "Heaven and earth are established, and the Yi moves within them, completing nature and preserving it, the measure of righteousness." Why must one enter through the door? The Commentary says, "Therefore, the superior man in his dwelling observes the images and contemplates the words, and in his movements observes the changes and contemplates the omens. Therefore, he is blessed by heaven, and there is good fortune without disadvantage." If one's heart is not steeped in the way of the Yi and one's body does not abide in the sea of righteousness, how can one dwell in peace and occupy auspicious omens? How to enter through the door? The Commentary says, "Opening the door is called Kun, closing the door is called Qian." This means that the way of Qian ends with Kun, and if one wishes to change and benefit to the fullest extent, and inspire to the utmost, one must still open it with the way of Qian. The Explanation of the Words for Qian's six Yao describes the method of learning in five ways: The first nine says, "A dragon's virtue but hidden, not changing the world, not achieving fame, retreating from the world without worry, not seen yet without worry, happy then acting, worried then withdrawing, truly unyielding, a hidden dragon." This is the learning of a recluse, cultivating oneself in poverty. The ninth three says, "Loyalty and sincerity are the means to advance, cultivating words and establishing sincerity are the means to abide in one's profession, knowing when to arrive and arriving is to be with opportunities, knowing when to end and ending is to preserve righteousness, therefore residing in a high position without arrogance, and in a low position without worry, therefore constantly vigilant in his time, though in danger without blame." This is the learning of a scholar-official, benefiting the world in success. The ninth two says, "A dragon's virtue and upright center, trusting in ordinary words, cautious in ordinary actions, guarding against evil and preserving sincerity, benefiting the world without boasting, virtue is broad and transforming." This is the learning of a village elder, even if one does not seek fame among the lords, one cannot forget one's family and country. The words "duke's virtue" clarify that it is not the duke's position. The ninth four says, "Up and down are not constant, not for evil, advancing and retreating are not constant, not leaving the group, the superior man advances in virtue and cultivates his profession, desiring to be in time." This is the learning of a hero of the times, desiring to test oneself in a leap, therefore not declining to be doubted by others. The words "without blame" mean desiring to advance in cultivation in time, not being rash to invite blame. The ninth five says, "Similar sounds respond to each other, similar qi seeks each other, water flows to dampness, fire goes to dryness, clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger, the sage acts and all things are seen, those who are rooted in heaven are close to the top, those who are rooted in earth are close to the bottom, each follows its kind." This is the learning of a great man, and the Yi is the great man among learning, therefore it can unite its virtue with heaven and earth, unite its brightness with the sun and moon, unite its order with the four seasons, unite its fortune with the ghosts and gods, preceding heaven and heaven does not violate it, following heaven and obeying the time of heaven, distinguishing the eight essentials is to enable each to follow its kind. The Commentary says, "Things are gathered by type, and objects are divided by category." Someone asked, "Qian has six Yao, why is the number of learning five, is there something missing?" The answer is, "The meaning of 'excess' is knowing to advance but not knowing to retreat, knowing to exist but not knowing to perish, knowing to gain but not knowing to lose. In the world of the decline, evil and chaos are mixed, and cunning people think of arguing to achieve their private desires. They also firmly believe that it is learning, but how can it be compared to those who know to advance and retreat, exist and perish, and do not lose their correctness? Therefore, it should be rejected from our learning." Then Yang Zhongyi lectured on the changes of the innate and acquired trigram images (part one). 1. Innate, which is the fixed image. Heaven and earth are determined, the top is honored and the bottom is humble, the sun and moon run, rising in the east and setting in the west. This is the innate image, so it is the body. The Commentary on the Trigrams says, "Heaven and earth are positioned," Shao said, "This is the position of the Fuxi Eight Trigrams, the learning of the innate." According to the Book of Rites, "The sacrifice to heaven in the southern suburbs is solemn, like the image of Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, and Dui in the west." Han scholars say, "The former kings made rites, based on the Yi," which is sufficient to show the old tradition of the Confucian school. Qian says, "After heaven and earth were divided, Qian ascended and Kun descended," which is the same as the Commentary, "Heaven is honored and earth is humble, Qian and Kun are determined." Therefore, heaven and earth are positioned, Qian and Kun distinguish the upper and lower divisions, the Commentary says, "The sun and moon push each other, the sun and moon run," Yu's note says, "The sun is Li, the moon is Kan," therefore the sun and moon face each other, Kan and Li are arranged at the gates of east and west. Xueyuan's Yitu says, "Thunder comes out of the earth and moves heaven, wind rises from heaven and travels the earth, mountains are rooted in the earth and rise upwards, and marshes descend from heaven." Therefore, Dui and Xun belong to the upper, then wind and rain come from heaven, Gen and Zhen are placed below, then thunder comes out of the earth. This is the constant body of the Yi, like a phenomenon of the universe. At this point, it has been four seasons, and it is appropriate to announce that the Chinese Studies course will be launched.

### Women's Cultivation

‚Äî Yi

Dr. Griffith once said in a magazine: "There is only one profession and business in the world that does not require any preparation before engaging in it, and that is marriage." I think this is really a mistake, because after forming a small family, many household affairs cannot be learned in a day, and knowledge of sexual knowledge, child rearing, etc., requires a long period of research. If you do not prepare in advance before marriage, you cannot have good results.

The female novelist Fannie Hurst (who wrote "Back Street" and other books) said it appropriately: "If you educate a man, you are only educating one person. If you educate a woman, you educate a family." It can be seen that women's cultivation is important, because her every move has a close relationship with every member of the family, and naturally has a great indirect impact on society.

We have received many letters from readers saying that their wives, regardless of their meager income, only know how to advocate luxury, and even complain about the lack of income. The reason for this situation is that these wives lack cultivation. At a time when it is difficult to make ends meet, every couple should learn the spirit of the musician Mozart. The Mozart couple did not have money to buy coal to make a fire on a cold day, so they danced in the house to increase their body temperature.

Ibsen was not an advocate of women's politics, but he believed that the foundation of marriage must be built on loyal, free, and wise companions. Full cultivation is a prerequisite for creating the foundation he established.

My Family Problems Essay Contest Announcement XI

### A Father Who Teaches His Child to Hit and Scold

‚Äî Xiu

Our parents are both around fifty years old. Besides having us five sisters, they finally fulfilled their long-cherished wish six years ago.

This was indeed a joyful occasion. After having five daughters in a row, Heaven actually bestowed upon them a son. And it was in their old age. No wonder Father, who always had a frowning face, smiled broadly ever after, and became much more energetic in his work. Father always insisted that daughters are outsiders, like water thrown out, and only raising a son brings success. Mother, even more so, thanked Heaven and Earth, saying that our younger brother was a life-saving bodhisattva, saving our whole family! It meant Father didn't have to take a concubine, and there was someone to inherit the family property. As for us, we were all extremely happy because we had gained a sibling of the opposite sex. However, misfortune began with this!

Father runs a millet shop, and Mother is illiterate. So, after our younger brother could speak, Father asked, "Child, what will you be when you grow up?" Then Mother spoke first, "Bao Shi will be a big boss, earning lots of money, living in a Western-style house, riding in a car, and eating fancy meals." Soon after, our younger brother could speak. He would say things like, "Sisters are women, they have to rely on men, they can't earn big money to support Mom and Dad; Bao Bao is a man, he can be a boss, a high official." "Get out of here, old servant! The big boss, the young master, is here, hurry up and pour tea! Clang, dong... clang! You're only fit to flatter the boss!"... Then the parents beside him would laugh heartily. The shop assistants would also join in the fun.

The gloom grew thicker, and our younger brother slowly learned to hit and scold people and other bad behaviors. The story is like this: On some day, Father said, "Bao Bao, can you hit Daddy? Hit him, try it, raise your little fist..." The younger brother did as he was told! "Haha, Bao Bao hit someone! Bao Bao, go kick Mommy, go kick! Kick her, and I'll buy you candied chestnuts to eat, go!" The younger brother obediently ran over: behind him, Father added, "Raise your little foot, harder! Ah, good!" After being kicked by the younger brother, Mom smiled sweetly, picked up the younger brother, kissed him, and then said, "Bao Bao, scold Daddy, scold him, 'old pig, old thing'!"

"Daddy is an old thing, an old pig." Subsequently, "Sisters are women" and other words were always on the younger brother's lips, he simply sang it like a folk song every day, alas! Younger brother.

Even more unexpectedly, our schooling was also affected by our younger brother! Our parents have definitely told us that if a daughter graduates from junior high school, she cannot continue her studies.

To save our younger brother and to make our parents realize the truth quickly, we have repeatedly advised them, but we have repeatedly received a scolding, because "an old-age son" is not easy to come by, it requires accumulated virtue from previous generations, good feng shui in the ancestral hall, and descendants doing good deeds. He must be a virtuous boy descended from heaven, with inherent qualities. You all seem to have a conscience now, but when you rely on men in the future, you will forget us, alas! What can we do?

Editor's Note

Chinese families are truly diverse and full of strange things. The painful complaints of these five sisters are easy to imagine. However, in this environment, one can only endure on the one hand and try to give parents some hints on the other, because to achieve practical results, a drastic method will not produce perfect results. Only by dealing with it calmly (but not compromising), and at the same time, not relaxing the pursuit of knowledge, it is best to study one or two practical subjects to achieve economic independence. It is truly a gratifying thing that five sisters have like minds and are together.

As for that young and ignorant younger brother, when he leaves his parents and enters the embrace of the school, he will gradually get rid of his wrong ideas.

### A Week's Family Menu

‚Äî Ms. Hua Ying

These few days, all prices have been rising again. Our seven necessities of life are certainly no exception. But there is one thing that is an exception: fresh ribbonfish are very cheap, the smaller ones cost five or six cents per tael, and the larger ones only cost seven or eight cents, probably because there is a large supply, flooding the market. Among fish, fresh ribbonfish give people a very good impression because they don't have many bones and are easy to remove, so even children can eat them safely. There are several ways to cook them: one is steaming, which makes the meat tender, but you need to add some scallions, ginger, and diced lard. A strong soy sauce is excellent, making the flavor very fresh. Another way is braising in soy sauce, which doesn't require any accompaniments. If you like sweet and sour, you can add sugar and vinegar. If you don't like sugar and vinegar, if you have rice wine lees, you can spread it on top and braise it together, the taste is not bad either.

Spring and Autumn

### It's Hard to Cook Without Rice

‚Äî Liao Ran

As long as one is a person with feelings, upon arriving at a crossroads and seeing the tense and precarious situation of the masses buying rice and coal briquettes, one will inexplicably feel a sense of sorrow; this sense of sorrow comes more from "self-pity" than from compassion. Nowadays, whether rich or poor, no one dares to be complacent. "Even with ponds and birds and beasts, how can one be happy alone?"

"The old and weak are left to die in ditches," this is not yet the case, even the strong are trembling with fear of being on the verge of extinction. Ordinary citizens need money to survive: if money is not easy to come by, there is only death. Thus, they first hang the young, then strangle the old, and then seek death themselves. In this way, a large group dies silently. If Heaven does not cut off all hope and they occasionally get money, then they can buy rice, start a fire, and cook porridge, but looking at the group of old and young, and then looking at themselves, having to seek survival in a line of six or seven hundred people, they are wailing and stamping their feet in long sighs. Here is an ordinary and true story: A certain employee of a certain company went to work in the morning, and walked home leisurely at noon for lunch. There was still no grain of rice in the pot. In a fit of anger, he questioned his wife. As for the wife, "'The little stars, three or five in the east, silently journeying at night, are busy day and night in public service'," at four in the morning, she abandoned the hungry crying baby and went to line up to buy rice. A weak woman with no strength to tie up a chicken, how could she be up to the task in the crowded and hungry crowd, being stepped on was not the only thing that happened, she almost lost the money. Returning home at noon, her hands were empty, it was still hard to cook without rice. The sadness in her heart can be imagined, and she also had to endure her husband's ridicule, anger and resentment flared up, and soon she secretly hanged herself in the back room. The husband discovered it and seemed to have no way, and also sought death.

There are even more ways for other groups of suicides to die, but they are all people who could not seek life.

In this year, the fine line "It is common for scholars to starve to death" may be a self-deprecating remark, but if one can find time to recite it, one will not die now; I think those who have some strength can still think of ways for the truly ordinary people!

The authorities have indeed made their best efforts for the people's livelihood problem in the past month, which is obvious to everyone. Now the masses have indeed reached the most painful time. The most benevolent people in the world, even if they are scorched, will not hesitate to think for the people. "People cannot live without water and fire, and in the evening, they knock on people's doors to ask for water and fire, and no one refuses." If there is grain like water and fire, then it is up to the Public Works Bureau authorities to make greater efforts.

### Shanghai Has No Night View

‚Äî Ye Ren

After the invention of neon lights, the night view of the city has been decorated to be extremely brilliant and beautiful. Some people, on a misty night, climbed high and looked far, marveling at it as a wonder of the world. Although I have not had the experience of admiring the lights on a misty night, but having seen goldfish swimming in a glass tank, I guess that the neon light through the water vapor does have a miracle that pleases the eye. Therefore, even the √ó√ó used clothing store, which has little to do with "business sense," once installed red and blue neon lights on the upper floor of the Great World, and indeed viewers gathered.

Now that trams have entered the depot at nine o'clock and household electricity use has been reduced to 80 percent, neon lights are naturally no longer the pride of the city at night. If that gentleman has that kind of enthusiasm again and looks out from a high place, even on a night with a bright moon in the sky, he will dejectedly exclaim: "Shanghai has no night view!"

In fact, the past nights in Shanghai were indeed brilliant and beautiful, but how much spirit and money were wasted under the lights? How many evils happened in the night market? Therefore, the current "early closing" is an emergency measure by the authorities to save electricity, but Shanghai people immersed in nightlife have indeed gained a good opportunity to get rid of bad habits, and at the same time, getting up early and going to bed early is also of great benefit to health. However, don't think that the electric light at home can still cope, so gather four people and sit around the table, playing mahjong until dawn, a fine of five yuan is still a small matter (French Concession regulations: those whose mahjong sounds reach outdoors after twelve o'clock at night will be fined five yuan), exceeding the electricity limit and having the wires cut, then you will really have to taste the dark life.

### Begonia

‚Äî Qin Shouou

15. Daddy, let's go busking!

So, after the landlady of this small inn made arrangements, Mei Bao became close to the girl surnamed Han in room 17 downstairs; the next day, he pulled Mr. Han upstairs to have a meal with Begonia, and everyone, in a situation of shared sympathy, agreed on a cooperation method. Although Mei Bao and the Han girl's singing skills were very different, it was not easy for outsiders to distinguish them; however, the Shandong man surnamed Han played the huqin too badly, and after a trial performance, it was decided that when going out to busk, Begonia would play the instrument completely, and the man surnamed Han would only use a second fiddle as accompaniment.

But Begonia did not suffer a loss either, because the man surnamed Han had many fellow villagers and knew many street heroes, which was of course a great help to their business. Therefore, after the cooperation began, everything went smoothly. There was only one thing that always made Begonia feel very unhappy, and that was the audience's attitude towards Mei Bao.

"I never thought we would be reduced to this!" He often sighed like this (284)

### I Bought Rice! Only One Sheng

‚Äî Qingshui

In the morning, I received two yuan and sixty cents from my father and took a "flour sack" from my mother to go to the market to buy rice. At first, I was a little coy, but finally straightened my back and strode towards the long line of people.

It was early, and the shops on the street had not yet opened. The iron gate of the √ó√ó rice shop was tightly closed, with a wooden door as a rear guard, and there was no movement inside, but the front of the door was bustling, with people swarming and pushing each other, standing in a long snake formation.

Time passed minute by minute, but more and more people joined in. It's almost ten o'clock, why hasn't it opened yet? The morning cold was so biting that the people who were close to each other stood even closer, but everyone hadn't eaten breakfast. Little Sanzi, who sells sesame cakes, was busy in the alley, and everyone swallowed saliva at him! My feet were a little sore and numb, but there was no way. Finally, the wooden door of the rice shop was only half opened, and "161" was written on the sleeve of my right arm in white powder. The formation was moving, and everyone was wriggling and shouting again!

The shadow of the utility pole next to it changed from oblique and long to almost gone before it reached my head. One hand sent in the money, and then one hand handed the flour sack into the two-foot square iron hole‚Äîthe source of life‚Äîseeing the rice, I forgot the pain in my feet.

"Change a one-dollar bill!" A sudden thunderbolt shocked me. Could it be fake?

"What's wrong?" I asked cautiously, softly.

"Don't you have eyes! Look at this rotten bill!" The roar was like a tiger's, and the money had already been thrown on the rice bag. On one side, he began to receive the money from the people behind me.

The fire in my heart was burning and almost burst out, but when I thought of my mother's anxious situation looking at the empty pot at this time, I had to suppress my temper.

"Just buy one sheng!" I said softly!

The flour sack was only filled with rice at the two corners, and I took it back lifelessly. I really wanted to cry. I stood for four full hours, squeezed, fought, scolded, felt sore, felt pain, felt hungry, "bending my waist for a sheng of rice"!
