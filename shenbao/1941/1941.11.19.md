### Initial Meeting Exceeds One Hour, Both U.S. and Japan Remain Silent; Kurusu and Nomura Continued Visits to the U.S. State Department Yesterday, Hull Says It's Too Early to Be Optimistic or Pessimistic

United Press, Washington, 18th - When Kurusu and Nomura left the White House yesterday, they only said "many incidents were discussed" when reporters inquired about the meeting. Detailed negotiations will begin this weekend. When asked if they were satisfied with the meeting, Kurusu directed reporters to ask Nomura. When asked about reports from Japan indicating no chance of reconciliation between the U.S. and Japan, Nomura replied, "This is purely speculation and not accurate." Hull said the initial meeting was of a general nature, and it is too early to say whether the overall situation is optimistic or pessimistic. Hull will meet with Kurusu again today.

Reuters, Washington, 18th - The Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Nomura, expressed optimism today about the talks to resolve various difficulties between the U.S. and Japan. When Nomura, accompanied by Japanese special envoy Kurusu, went to the U.S. State Department today to continue discussions with U.S. Secretary of State Hull, he said to the reporters waiting there, "We believe there is great hope. Why are the editorials in the newspapers here so gloomy?" Nomura then added with a smile, "You Americans are always of a fighting nature. Why are you so alarmed?" A reporter said that the editorials in Tokyo newspapers were not very peaceful either. Nomura just smiled.

Reuters, Washington, 18th - When Kurusu and Nomura entered the State Department yesterday for their initial talks with Hull, they appeared quite serious. After an hour, when Kurusu and others walked across the street into the White House, fifty reporters and several photographers rushed forward to surround them, but to no avail. Kurusu and Nomura both refused to speak, even refusing to pose for photos or wait for a moment for them to take pictures. They quickly got into their car and ordered the driver to leave quickly before the door was closed, nearly injuring a reporter with the car door. Hull later stated during a press briefing that the talks were only of a preliminary nature. Although the Secretary of State's preliminary remarks and pleasantries did not seem to require seventy minutes, there was no real sense of urgency. The talks proceeded in a leisurely manner from beginning to end. It is clear that the extension of time benefits the United States and not Japan. Hull was unwilling to discuss Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's remarks because he had not had time to study them. However, the general reaction here is that if Japan truly wants peace and good relations with the U.S., then there could not be a more inappropriate and foolish statement.

Demands Raised by Tojo Unacceptable to the U.S.

According to a special correspondent for Reuters, Washington officials believe that Japan, having sent a special envoy to the U.S. to seek a solution and harmonious relations, is still shouting from the rooftops and making demands that are clearly unacceptable to the U.S. Tojo's abrupt announcement in Parliament before his special envoy could even speak is considered the worst possible way to start a discussion. What Tojo said is undoubtedly the demands that Kurusu brought to the U.S., but if Tojo's statement represents Kurusu's mission, then that mission is doomed to failure before it even begins. One or two of Tojo's demands, in the view of people here, can be summarized into one demand: that the U.S. recognize Japan's aggression and the results it has achieved so far, as well as Japan's hegemony in the Western Pacific and East Asia. This is, of course, just a bargaining chip, and Japan will certainly be willing to accept a lower price. However, no matter how much this bargaining price is reduced, there is little hope that it will fall within the limits acceptable to the U.S. Many believe that Kurusu's trip is a waste of time for Japan, but it is not entirely without benefit. The U.S. is strong in power and resolute in will, and it is militarily and economically far superior to Japan. The Japanese representatives in the U.S. did not seem to understand this situation, but Kurusu can now convey this to the Tojo cabinet. As for the U.S., the longer the talks last, the more advantageous it is for the U.S. because its war production will increase, and it will build more warships and merchant ships. Not only that, but the destructive effect of the economic restrictions imposed on Japan by the U.S. and Britain will also be greater. Therefore, the U.S. can sit back and watch Japan's future actions. It seems that this is exactly what the U.S. is doing now.

United Press, Tokyo, 18th - Government officials are studying the first report of Kurusu's meeting with President Roosevelt, but have not yet indicated whether the situation has deteriorated. According to sources close to the Ministry of the Navy, the Navy is fully prepared to defend Japan against any threat or attack, but still hopes that the Washington talks will enable Japan to obtain its national security and prosperity peacefully. The same sources also said that the Navy supports using all possible means to make peace with the U.S. while also stating that the Navy must prepare for the most unfortunate events that may occur if the U.S. does not recognize Japan's legitimate needs as the leading nation in the Far East.

Havas, Washington, 17th - Although there has been no official reaction here to Prime Minister Tojo's speech in Parliament yesterday, those close to the State Department said that the conditions Tojo proposed for resolving U.S.-Japan issues are completely contrary to the fundamental principles of U.S. Far East policy. The U.S. will never recognize Japan's invasion of China, and Tojo's demand that the U.S. "allow Japan to complete the China Incident" cannot be accepted either. As for Japan's hope that the U.S. will ease the economic blockade, if the Japanese government can provide guarantees to abandon its "policy of aggression," then the U.S. side may be open to discussion. In short, the U.S. is determined to implement its Far East policy. Although Kurusu's arrival from afar is enough to bring U.S.-Japan negotiations to a new stage, the results will certainly be scattered. Both sides remain silent on the progress of the negotiations, and it is difficult to predict whether a compromise agreement can be reached. What is clear is that Kurusu and Nomura seemed unhappy when they left the White House.

The Only Common Ground at Present is Avoiding War

United Press, Washington, 18th - Authoritative sources said yesterday that the U.S. may grant Japan allied status as the basis for resolving serious disputes. Japanese sources believe that the atmosphere is more promising than at any time in the past few days, mainly because of the friendly attitude of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull in receiving Nomura and Kurusu and meeting with them. They also said that U.S. officials will point out that a comprehensive change in Japanese foreign policy is the only possible basis for coordination, otherwise the U.S. will not consider demands such as those made by Tojo in Parliament. They also said that unless Japan is willing to consider withdrawing from the Axis and turning its national strength to helping the democratic countries against Hitler, the U.S. will reject Tojo's demands to ease the economic blockade and stop aid to China. These sources said that under these conditions, the U.S. may use its position to bring about a reconciliation between Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, and Japan can obtain legitimate economic rights in China in this kind of settlement through equal treatment with other Western powers and full cooperation with Chinese sovereignty. They also said that the U.S. may take another step, namely increasing aid to China, recognizing that Japan's southward advance is about to threaten the source of the U.S.'s main raw materials. Therefore, if Japan attacks Thailand, it will be regarded as a direct attack on the U.S. Regarding how the U.S.'s supply lines to China will be maintained once war breaks out, it is said that the U.S. may use "land convoys" to protect transportation. Informed sources also said that, so far, the only agreement between the U.S. and Japan is the common hope to avoid a war in the Pacific.

United Press, Tokyo, 18th - Tokyo newspapers all wrote articles commenting on the speeches of Prime Minister Tojo and Finance Minister Togo, warning countries hostile to Japan, especially the U.S., of Japan's unwavering determination to advance its national policy. Asahi Shimbun commented that the Prime Minister clearly announced the three major principles of our country's foreign policy, while also expressing the government's determination to respond to any eventuality. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that if the U.S. abandons its hostile attitude towards Japan, then Britain and the Dutch East Indies will follow the U.S. "so that the Pacific crisis can be averted." It also said, "If the U.S. continues to aid Chiang Kai-shek and interfere with Japan's efforts to resolve the China Incident, then a fundamental adjustment of U.S.-Japan relations is absolutely hopeless."

Reuters, Tokyo, 18th

Newspaper editorials here expressed disappointment because government personnel did not disclose the current status of the U.S.-Japan talks. Chugai Shogyo Shimpo said that the diplomatic negotiations in Washington are related to the future of the Japanese Empire and that the authorities should release more information about this matter. Asahi Shimbun said that if the U.S. can understand Japan's true intentions, then the future is not entirely without hope.

U.S. Will Notify Britain of the Trend of Talks with Japan

Reuters, London, 18th - The U.S. government will notify Britain of the trend of the "peace or war" talks that Hull and Kurusu began in Washington on Monday. When British Prime Minister Churchill declared that if the U.S. goes to war with Japan, Britain will declare war within an hour, Kurusu had already left Tokyo. The Prime Minister's words have a profound impact on the entire Far East and can influence the talks currently underway in Washington. Britain and the U.S. are now adopting parallel policies in the Far East, as in many other international issues. Both countries are committed to assisting China in its war for freedom and providing all possible material assistance. Both countries have frozen Japanese funds, which will undoubtedly have a significant impact on Japan, whose economic resources, industry, and standard of living have long been exhausted by the war in China. Britain and the U.S. have made it clear that they are not prepared to make concessions to Japan on any fundamental issues. The speeches made in Tokyo this week have not made any progress on the current issues, and convening Parliament with the intention of shocking other countries has proven to be an ineffective wet firecracker. Japan's professed loyalty to the Axis powers has certainly been severely hit. Mussolini's embarrassing situation is clearly a warning to Japan, and Tokyo is now seeing that the German army has suffered huge losses and is now blocked by heavy snow, perhaps to wait for the winter without achieving its main goal. Japan will also see that the Red Army is fighting firmly and has not withdrawn the Soviet army stationed in the East that is constantly watching.

Reuters, London, 18th - Although officials are not commenting on the outlook for the Pacific situation, they are extremely pessimistic in light of the tough tone of the speeches made by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Togo in Parliament yesterday. Informed sources said that the time for empty words has passed, and the next few days will be about action. The attitude of Britain and the U.S. towards the Pacific and Far East situation is very clear, and any new developments in the Washington talks that break the deadlock must be made by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo. So far, the Japanese government has hinted at what it wants to gain from the talks without indicating what rewards Japan is prepared to offer. Peace in the Pacific now depends on U.S.-Japan talks, but as reported by the Times' Washington correspondent, if the Japanese government wants to avoid important issues such as withdrawing Japanese troops from China and Vietnam, or seeks to maintain control of vast areas, as well as the existence of equal trade rights for the U.S. in the Far East, then the hope of peace is very slim. Although the general public expects the U.S. government to constantly inform the British government about the U.S.-Japan talks, they are not optimistic about the possible outcome of the talks, and have undoubtedly taken all possible measures to prepare for any eventuality.

Chinese Sources Believe U.S. and Japan Will Ultimately Find It Difficult to Compromise

Reuters, Chongqing, 18th - The opinion of Chinese newspapers and officials is that there can be no compromise between the U.S. and Japan, and Kurusu's mission to Washington will certainly fail. People from all walks of life are using U.S.-Japan negotiations as material for their speculation. Although they almost unanimously believe that there can be no general compromise between the two countries, they acknowledge that partial compromises are possible, and they believe that the chances of negotiations completely breaking down are very slim, because both the U.S. and Japan seem unwilling to fight in the Pacific at present. Regarding the possibility of partial compromises, there are roughly two types: If Japan is willing to guarantee that it will not attack the north or advance south, and will at least remain neutral in the current European war, then the U.S. will at least partially ease its current economic pressure on Japan; The U.S. will be responsible for mediating the Sino-Japanese war. However, both of the above possibilities will only extend the period of reckoning between the two sides, leaving the U.S.-Japan crisis to be resolved in the future, because they have not provided a satisfactory and permanent solution to the East Asian issue. In the first possibility, there is often the danger of Japan waiting for an opportunity to take further aggressive action, and in the second possibility, since China insists on the demand that Japanese troops must completely withdraw from Chinese territory, there is absolutely no possibility of compromise between China and Japan. At the same time, the possibility of U.S.-Japan negotiations completely breaking down still exists, because Japan often faces the crisis of extreme elements overthrowing the current regime and completely controlling the government, and causing the country to take crazy risks.

### Japanese Parliament Passes Special Military Budget and Resolves to Condemn U.S. Actions; Japan Massively Conscripts Troops Reaching Two Million

United Press, Tokyo, 18th - The House of Peers unanimously passed the 3,800,000,000 yen special military expenditure budget bill today without any amendments. The bill was quickly passed by the Lower House last night. At the same time, the Lower House Committee has begun to review the three major important bills concerning rice tax and increasing production and promoting industrial equipment.

Reuters, 18th, Tokyo - Today, the House of Representatives passed a resolution stating that the biggest obstacle to resolving the war in China is the actions taken by the United States leading hostile countries. It also stated that the main driving force behind the current conflict between the Axis powers and Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is the despicable desire of the United States to dominate the world. The resolution was jointly proposed by various groups in the House of Representatives and explained by member Shimada. The resolution urged the government to resolutely implement its established national policy. The resolution stated: "The unreasonable nature of the U.S. government's position, in refusing to recognize and attempting to interfere with Japan's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency, build a co-prosperity sphere, and promote the peaceful economic coexistence and co-prosperity of East Asian nations, is obvious. The Japanese people are deeply convinced that there will be no opportunity for prosperity without persevering in this great war." The resolution also stated that issuing more public bonds and increasing taxes are for the sake of war.

Reuters, 18th, Tokyo - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters this morning that the statement in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun that there is no hope for U.S.-Japan talks unless the U.S. completely stops aiding Chongqing probably represents the opinion of the majority of the Japanese people. However, Ishii remained cautious about the government's attitude and did not express it. Ishii commented on the three points mentioned by Tojo in his speech in Parliament yesterday, saying that these three points actually represent the general principles of foreign policy that Japan can apply to any third country. However, the Prime Minister did not say that these three points are the basis for the Washington talks. Referring to the Foreign Minister's statement that Japan's interests in the north are facing possible threats, he said that Japan cannot tolerate any interference by third countries in the north. The so-called "north" mainly refers to the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union. When reporters asked how the Soviet Union responded to the Japanese government's protest regarding the sinking of the Japanese ship Kibi Maru by a floating mine, Ishii replied that the case is currently under discussion. When asked if the Soviet Union has acknowledged that the floating mine belonged to the Soviet Union, Ishii still said that this point is currently under discussion.

United Press, Tokyo, 18th - The Japan Times and Mail commented this morning, "As a result of yesterday's speech in Parliament, Japan has now placed all the cards it has in its hands on the table. What happens next depends on the United States." The newspaper is generally considered to speak on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It said that Japan does not see why the U.S. and Japan cannot reach an agreement unless the United States is unwilling to recognize Japan's need for a foundation for national security. If a U.S.-Japan war breaks out, it will "cause great destruction to mankind." At the same time, the House of Representatives yesterday abandoned questioning the government's speech, so only former Iron Minister Ogawa asked a few questions. Ogawa asked about the U.S.-Japan talks, and Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo said that he agreed with Ogawa's suggestion that Japan's diplomacy should not be too secret, so he would announce diplomatic and military news "as much as possible" to seek the understanding of the Japanese people. Tojo said that he also agreed to put the country on a complete war footing and take financial policies sufficient to obtain military expenses and increase military materials. The Prime Minister said that he knows that the government should make improvements and changes, and the government is currently planning to do so.

United Press, London, 18th - Well-informed sources here said that Japan has recently conscripted all its troops, numbering about two million men. Informed sources said that the full mobilization of such a large number shows that Japan's military expansion is only limited by munitions and equipment. In recent months, it has been reported that 100,000 reservists have been called up. Recent reports indicate that the Japanese army on a wartime basis now has nearly sixty divisions, with each division having about 20,000 men, and twenty independent brigades, with each brigade having 5,000 men, and several cavalry units. In addition, Japan has twelve to fifteen tank units. Experts say that the Japanese army is weakest in mechanized artillery units. In addition to the 500,000 in Northern China, Korea, mainland China, Taiwan, and French Indochina, there are about 500,000 Japanese troops in Japan.

### U.S. President Asks Congress to Approve Army and Navy Expenditures; Neutrality Act Amendment Also Signed; One Hundred Merchant Ships to Be Armed Soon

Reuters, Washington, 18th - President Roosevelt has now asked Congress to continue to approve 6,687,000,000 yuan for the Army, half of which is specifically for armaments. It is estimated that 269,000,000 yuan is listed for Philippine Army expenses, and 388,000,000 yuan for increasing national defense equipment and supplies production expenses. The President also advocated allowing the Army Chief to dispose of any equipment purchased for the Army after March 11, 1941, in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act. In another budget, the President requested 308,000,000 yuan for Navy expenses, including 120,000,000 yuan for arming merchant ships. The so-called armament is probably the cannon that Congress is allowed to use in the Neutrality Act Amendment to defend against submarine attacks. This Navy budget will allow the Navy to use 300,000,000 yuan to build, purchase, or modify more than 400 small ships as mine-laying and patrol escorts.

Reuters, Manila, 18th - The number of Philippine Army reservists has not been announced, but they have been ordered to report to their units for incorporation into the U.S. Far East Army. It is believed that the total number of these reservists is 150,000, all of whom will be incorporated in December.

Havas, Washington, 17th - President Roosevelt signed the Neutrality Act Amendment at 4:30 p.m. today, allowing U.S. merchant ships to be armed and sail to the ports of belligerent countries. One hundred U.S. giant merchant ships are ready to enter shipyards to install weapons.

Reuters, Washington, 18th - U.S. passenger and cargo planes will fly directly to Britain under the Neutrality Act Amendment, and U.S. pilots can also take on the task of flying planes to Britain in accordance with the Neutrality Act Amendment.

### Japanese Troops Move Towards Thai Border

Reuters, London, 18th - The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent said today that as the British and U.S. navies gather in the Far East, it is reported that the Japanese ground and air forces concentrated in northern Vietnam are moving southwest towards the Thai border. The messages received here from Thailand all reflect a sense of anxiety.

United Press, Bangkok, 18th - The government issued a communiqué last night stating that Thailand is currently independent and sovereign, and no country can take away its independence. It also said that what was published in the Tokyo Chugai Shogyo Shimpo is part of Japan's current campaign to prove that Thailand is uniting with the U.S., Britain, China, and the Netherlands. At the same time, reliable sources here said that Thailand's highest commanders include Prime Minister Major General Plaek Phibunsongkhram as Army Commander-in-Chief, Rear Admiral Chalieo Tejapaibul as Navy Commander, and Air Vice Marshal Direk Chaiyanam as Air Force Commander.

Editorial

### Retrospect and Prospect of the German-Soviet War Situation

Looking at the recent situation, we seem to be able to conclude that before next spring, the German army will not only fail to capture Leningrad, or reach the Caucasus and the Middle East, but even Hitler's personally declared current goal — the occupation of Moscow — will probably be impossible to achieve. On the entire front, which is about 1,700 English miles, or about 5,000 Chinese li, heavy snow has already been falling; and in the past two days, the severe cold climate has especially reached its peak. In such a typical Soviet Russian winter environment, if the belligerents do not have superhuman cold resistance and cold protection methods, any large-scale war will be impossible to conduct. What this means is: in the long period (from now to around April or May next year) of over a hundred days, a stalemate will inevitably occur between the German and Soviet armies, waiting for the arrival of spring before making a decisive battle. The large-scale and fierce war in history, as of today, can be considered to have ended its first period.

Therefore, at this time, it provides us with a very appropriate opportunity to first make a concise settlement for the past experience of this German-Soviet war: on the other hand, to make a rough estimate of its current and future development.

For five months, the war has been going on day and night, and neither side has had the slightest chance to catch their breath. The troops used by both sides on the front line have probably always been around three million. Based on the statistics from the German and Soviet official sources, and the estimates of other neutral observers, in summary, the casualties and losses suffered by both sides have also exceeded three million people. In other words, the total number of troops used by Germany and the Soviet Union before and after has each been around six million people. On the Soviet side, how much of its total strength has been used is still not known to have more accurate and reliable figures, but it has been in the position of defender, so the size of the resistance force must be directly proportional to the attacking force, so just by looking at how much strength the attacker, Germany, has used, we can infer how much strength the Soviet army has used. According to the estimate published by the British side, roughly, if the highest amount of land forces that Germany can use on the battlefield is ten million, then it has used six-tenths of its strength. On the air force side, Germany used four-fifths of its total strength as soon as it started the war against the Soviet Union; and when it launched its offensive against Moscow in early October, it concentrated half of its remaining strength on the Eastern Front again. In the past five months, the aircraft and tanks lost by both Germany and the Soviet Union have each exceeded ten thousand. Adding together such a vast number of items as fighting on the front lines, continuous losses in the process, and continuous replenishment from the rear, we seem to be able to reach a correct conclusion that the total strength that Germany and the Soviet Union can use has now reached its peak.

The greatest characteristic of the German military's offensive against the Soviet Union this time is the complete failure of the "Blitzkrieg." Germany can destroy Poland and defeat France in one fell swoop; but for the Soviet Union, it has had to launch new offensives again and again. The first German offensive only forced the Soviet army to retreat into the territory before September 1939, and it could no longer advance. So Hitler replenished fresh troops and launched a major offensive again. The greatest gain of this second offensive was the occupation of Minsk and Smolensk in the middle route, and after that, it could no longer move forward. Then it increased its fresh troops again, targeting Ukraine in the south and Leningrad in the north, and engaged in a third offensive. After a fierce battle, the vanguard of the south route only reached the Dnieper River; the north route was always blocked outside Leningrad. Until the end, the Soviet army in the south route voluntarily withdrew from the auxiliary. At this time, the German army's attacking power showed exhaustion again, and it could no longer advance. Therefore, from October 1, Hitler made the greatest determination and clearly announced the purpose of defeating the Soviet army and capturing Moscow before winter, so the attacking power at the beginning was very fierce, which was the fourth German offensive. When this offensive was first launched, the Soviet army showed signs of difficulty in support, and the Soviet spokesman also began to admit for the first time that the German army was in a local advantage in terms of both personnel and materials, but on the one hand, the climate and geographical conditions greatly helped the Soviet army, and at the same time, the vigilance and skill of the Soviet command and the heroic fighting of the rearguard troops also fulfilled the greatest task. Therefore, the Soviet army's fresh troops were able to continuously open up to the Moscow area and stabilize the war situation. After nearly fifty days of fierce fighting day and night, by now, the German army has undoubtedly been blocked on the outer perimeter of Moscow, and its attacking power has become the end of its tether. The situation that is relatively serious now is still the war situation on the Crimean Peninsula in the south route, but even if the German army can occupy the entire island, it is still far from rushing into the Caucasus and the Middle East. Judging from the situation, Hitler may not be determined to launch a fifth offensive in the winter.

Therefore, the biggest problem facing the German army now is not fighting, but how to survive the winter. According to the London Times, the area after the Soviet army's retreat is not only a scorched earth, but also countless landmines and bombs have been buried in advance on this scorched earth. The German army does not dare to live in the remaining tall buildings, and does not even dare to restore the power plant, guarding against the complete explosion of all the landmines once the current is turned on. With the traffic lines constantly attacked by guerrillas, food is also a serious problem. The German army's winter plight can be imagined. However, once next spring arrives, the initiative must be transferred to the hands of Britain and the Soviet Union, and a decisive attack will be launched. The elimination of the dark forces in Europe is already just a matter of time.

### US "Flying Fortress" Appears; Soviet War Situation Focuses on Both Ends; Germany Claims Capture of Kerch and Large-Scale Offensive Towards Caucasus

Moscow TASS, 18th – On the 17th, our troops fought the enemy along the entire line. The fighting in the areas of Gassino and southwest was particularly fierce. On the 16th, 22 German planes were shot down, and we lost 6. On the same day, 11 German planes were shot down near Moscow. The previous report of 3 planes was inaccurate.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, Havas, 17th – An American "Flying Fortress" suddenly appeared today between Moscow and Leningrad.

London, Reuters, 18th – Today's Eastern Front news focuses on the extreme north and extreme south of the war. The Soviet forces in the north seem to be very successful, but in the Crimean Peninsula, the Germans claim to have occupied Kerch, and say "German troops are now facing the Caucasus." A Nazi headquarters spokesman said that German troops will attack the Kerch Strait, which is about eight miles wide and separates the Crimean Peninsula from the mainland. The Germans also report that German dive bombers and high-flying bombers are constantly attacking Soviet ships and transport ships carrying Soviet soldiers and supplies withdrawing from the Kerch Strait, and that the German army will attack the Caucasus as a major exercise in invading England. In the rest of the vast front, only the Soviets have repeatedly reported success. The battle situation in Leningrad seems promising. According to the Soviet news agency, the Soviet army is currently advancing rapidly along the left bank of the N River (roughly referring to the Neva River). The German troops on the Leningrad front have now been driven out of their strong positions, which they have held for two months, and are retreating. Although the Germans have repeatedly counterattacked, they have all failed. The Soviets have captured a lot of war equipment, and the enemy has suffered casualties. Soviet bombers and low-flying attack aircraft cooperated with artillery to destroy enemy artillery positions, clearing the way for Soviet infantry to advance. As for the Moscow front, the Germans have had to admit that they have been contained, and say that the reason is the bad weather. The Soviet government promptly recognized the danger threatening the Soviet capital, and rushed to mobilize fresh troops to join General Sokolov's Soviet troops to defend the perimeter of Moscow, resulting in new fierce battles, which are still in progress.

Soviet Army Builds Elaborate Underground Defenses on the Rybachy Peninsula

Although the German army in Leningrad recently cut off the railway from the area to Volokoda and put pressure on the Tikhvin area (110 miles southeast of Leningrad), Leningrad still maintains traffic with the rest of the Soviet Union. According to Soviet sources, the elite assault teams of the German army in northern Karelia have failed after attacking the Kesdanja area for two weeks, and 4,000 soldiers have died in the battle site trying to block Soviet traffic in the Murmansk region. In some areas, the German army has had to retreat. According to the Red Star newspaper, after more than five months of fighting, the Rybachy Peninsula in the northern part of European Russia is still in the hands of the Soviet army. Earlier, several divisions of the German army attacked, but the Soviet general in the area ordered a small team of Soviet troops to retreat, and then, with the help of artillery units placed on nearby mountains, drove the German army out of the peninsula. Soviet artillery units now control areas within several miles around. Soviet coastal artillery has also sunk several transport ships carrying German troops and supplies from Norway to Petsamo. The Soviet army on the Rybachy Peninsula has built elaborate underground defenses over the past few months and built military roads.

Moscow, TASS, 18th – A special correspondent for the Red Star newspaper said that the masses of the "Greater Germany" 384th and 8553rd Regiments, as well as the German 3rd Tank Division, were heavily damaged. After the Red Army began its counterattack, the "Greater Germany" 855th and 384th Divisions were the first to flee in panic. Although the German commander tried to stop them with machine guns, it was ineffective. After a few hours, the "Greater Germany Regiment" was also unable to hold on and retreated. However, not only on the Tula front, but also in other areas, the German army has begun to abandon their armor and flee. For example, a motorized infantry regiment of the German 212th Division abandoned its armor and fled for eleven kilometers. Although the German commander tried hard to stop them, they continued to race without stopping. In addition, similar acts of desertion occurred in various units of the German 19th and 31st Divisions. The Red Star newspaper's special correspondent inspected the southern suburbs of Tula the morning before yesterday and found a large number of German uniforms and food, which is enough to show the panic situation of the German army's escape.

### Another German Peace Offensive; Offers Truce to England; Otherwise, Will Request Passage Through Turkey and Spain

England Decides to Attack Libya First

Ankara, United Press, 18th – The German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, yesterday proposed a truce to England and warned that the Axis powers will eventually demand certain transit facilities from Turkey and Spain. The German Ambassador issued an order, recognizing that if England refuses the truce, the war will be very long. He said that the next step for Germany will be to drive the British out of the Mediterranean, and said that Turkey and Spain will still be strong countries in the east and west ends of the Mediterranean, exempt from special treatment. The result may be that they will require the supply of certain transit facilities and cooperation in the use of minerals. British and neutral observers regard the truce proposal as another stage of the German peace offensive, because Germany should have realized that England has no intention of slowing down its operations. However, it is believed that the proposal can confirm the widespread belief here that a war will occur in the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is widely believed in England that in the new war, England will first launch a major offensive against Libya, which now seems to be about to begin at any time. At the same time, it is expected that the German army will withdraw most of its troops from the Soviet Union, leaving a part of the army to make a final effort to seize Moscow and occupy the Caucasus to the mountain range before winter. Military experts do not believe that the German army can greatly reinforce, but the German air force will make important reinforcements. Military experts also believe that a large number of German troops should now be entering Bulgaria. The route of the German army's actions in the spring has been demonstrated in Papen's mentioned "transit facilities" and the Bulgarian politicians' declaration of war in the Bulgarian parliament, as well as the budget of more than two and a half million Bulgarian currency for the development of Bulgarian railways. If, as Papen predicted, Turkey will be exempted, then the German army may use Bulgarian seaports for maritime transport to the Caucasus and a major advance south through Iran. Regardless of which route the German army will use, it all depends on how successful and rapid the future Libyan war will be, so that the main manpower and material resources can be transferred to the north. Regarding the joint defense of the Caucasus, the only thing that can be confirmed at present is that this plan is already under consideration.

### Litvinov Arrives in Tehran

Stockholm, Reuters, 18th – The new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, and Sir Monkton, Director of the British Propaganda Bureau in Cairo, arrived in Tehran by plane yesterday. The plane was forced to land on the coast of the Caspian Sea due to a snowstorm.

Tehran, United Press, 18th – Before going to the United States, Litvinov will go to London for discussions with British officials.

### United States Prepares with All Its Might to Stop Coal Miners' Strike; Strike Situation Becomes Increasingly Tense; President Suspends Trip to Warm Springs

Washington, Reuters, 18th – It is heard that President Roosevelt is prepared to restore coal production with all the power of the government. According to people close to the White House, the President now believes that the time has come for the government to implement a strong policy against all strikes that hinder national defense production. According to reliable sources, the President can no longer be patient and is prepared to deal a major blow to the President of the Mine Workers Union, Lewis, or anyone else who hinders national defense production. Major steel companies have announced that they will try to get all miners to work, hoping that their employees will do their best to produce coal for national defense. According to sources in the House of Representatives lounge, President Roosevelt approves of the concepts contained in the first part of the strike control bill to be discussed by the House next week, which stipulates that strikes will be prohibited unless a majority of workers vote in favor under government supervision. Some members believe that if the coal miners' strike is not resolved quickly, the President will send a message to Congress recommending the enactment of laws based on the above principles, and it is believed that if this law is passed, it will also prohibit sympathy strikes. At the same time, according to Evans, a member of the executive committee of the Industrial Organization and Mine Workers Union's Second District, the miners of various mines in North Cambria Town, Pennsylvania, about 75 percent, have voted in favor of taking the same action today in sympathy with the striking mines. The union members in the district are estimated to be about 10,000.

Washington, Reuters, 18th – In addition to the coal miners of the steel companies, at least 15 other coal mines also had sympathy strikes yesterday, causing the labor unrest to become increasingly tense. At the same time, important Democratic members of Congress, because the labor unrest is hindering national defense, are eager to find a way to stop the strike as soon as possible. Cox, Chairman of the House Rules Committee, has asked Congress to immediately compile the necessary legislation to deal with this situation, and not wait until the coal mine dispute is resolved. Speaker of the House Rayburn also said that the House should try to debate legislation with appropriate considerations as soon as possible. Although the coal mines of the steel companies claim to be on full strike, some of the 53,000 miners still come to work, which the union pickets cannot stop. President Lewis of the Mine Workers Union sent a letter to the President yesterday, saying that the union would never accept the contract of the steel company's coal mine being opened as a factory, because this contract would invalidate all other bituminous coal industry contracts. The policy committee of the Mine Workers Union applauded when Lewis said that the union was fighting the steel companies, not resisting the government. Lewis also said that Fuller, manager of US Steel, and Pinar, manager of Youngstown Steel, were both prepared to sign a "union factory" contract, stipulating that all miners who have not joined the union must join the union after the probationary period, but Grace, President of Bethlehem Steel, strongly opposed it. Fuller, Pinar, and Grace met with the President at the White House yesterday for an hour and refuted Lewis's statement to reporters that their opinions differed, saying that they agreed on the "union factory" on two points and that they would prepare a report and submit it to the President. The Industrial Organization Congress met in Detroit yesterday and unanimously passed a resolution proposed by the council to fully support the Mine Workers Union's actions in the non-union coal mine dispute.

Washington, Reuters, 18th – According to official sources, President Roosevelt has canceled his trip to Warm Springs on November 20 because of busy official duties and the tense coal miners' strike.

### Renowned German Air Force General Killed in Crash; Accident During Aircraft Testing

Berlin, Reuters, 18th – Lieutenant General Udet of the German Air Force, who served as the director of the German Air Force Technical Department, passed away yesterday due to serious injuries sustained while testing a new weapon (aircraft). The Führer Hitler has ordered the naming of the 3rd Fighter Wing as the "Lieutenant General Udet Fighter Wing" to show his respect. Udet was born in Frankfurt, Germany on April 26, 1896. He was an air force officer during the last World War. From 1914 to 1918, he shot down 62 enemy aircraft. In 1922, Udet organized an aircraft manufacturing plant in Munich. Four years later, it expanded into the famous "Udet Factory" in Augsburg. He participated in several international air races and was consistently recognized as the world's first-class aviator.

### British Organizing Supply Route to Soviet Union; Via Baluchistan and Iran, Direct to Trucks for Second Run

New Delhi, Reuters, 18th – The British are organizing a supply route from India, via Baluchistan and eastern Iran, directly to the Soviet Union, and establishing another connection to the Soviet Union. A truck has been test-driven on this route, carrying jute, which the Soviet Union urgently needs. The results of the first journey have yielded valuable information about the desolation and aridity of the 750-mile countryside between Baluchistan and Iran. Now the truck will carry resin for a second test run on this route. After being shipped to the United States, it is hoped that a system of scheduled truck runs on this route with few obstacles can be formulated. The Persian Auxiliary Transport Team has now been formed and is managed by experienced military officers and staff. The team has a large number of trucks from India, driven by Indian civilian drivers. There are currently 5,000 laborers improving the road surface, and this number is expected to increase to 8,000 soon. The Persian government is cooperating with the transportation on this route, such as canceling certain customs procedures and assisting in protecting the route to prevent bandits from looting trucks. The war equipment and raw materials supplied by the United States are now being transported to the Soviet Union via the Caspian Sea coast and various unloading yards in the Caucasus, and their quantity will soon increase dramatically. At the ports in the Persian Gulf, such as Basra, supplies from Australia, the United States, Britain, and India are constantly arriving and being transported overland to a number of locations in northern Iran, where they are received by Soviet transport agencies and transported into the Soviet Union. Railway locomotives and railway personnel supplied by India and other places are being transported to Iran to increase the maximum traffic volume on the railway line from the Persian Gulf, through Iran, to the Caspian Sea. It is hoped that the number of military trips on this line per day will triple by the end of this month. Indian contractors have been tasked with developing port facilities in Iran. Basra, which was once the back door of the Near East, is now the front door of Turkey and the Soviet Union. Supplies from this modern port are transported north by rail and road. British commercial companies have now provided more trucks than are currently needed for transportation on Iranian highways and have ordered more trucks to meet their needs.

Ottawa, Reuters, 18th – The Canadian Bureau of Statistics revealed that war supplies worth a total of 1.89 million yuan were shipped to the Soviet Union in October.

### American Catholic Priests Fully Support National Defense

### Fourth Regiment About to Leave Shanghai; Will Not Return to Station in China; US Has Declared Post-War Abandonment of Extraterritorial Rights; Transfer of Defense to Be Decided Before Departure

There have been widespread rumors about the US liner repeating its voyage to Shanghai. According to authoritative sources in the foreign shipping industry, one President liner each is expected to arrive in Shanghai around Friday of this week and Monday of next week. The two mail ships will not stay in Shanghai for long and will return to the US soon. It is also learned that British women and children are also evacuating Shanghai. The British Embassy has designated the ships of Jardine Matheson to leave Shanghai for Singapore and transfer to Australia. A British official said yesterday morning that the latest evacuation notice issued by the British Consulate-General in Shanghai to the British community in the city last week has seen many women and children registered for evacuation. The registration deadline was last Saturday. In the last two days of the deadline, the number of British nationals who went to the British Consulate's evacuation office to register increased sharply. According to the news that the US military will indeed leave Shanghai, it was also spread on Friday and Saturday of last week.

### Transfer of Defense to Be Decided Within Week

The US Navy Fourth Regiment is ready to depart. The question of who will take over the defense of Area C that it leaves behind was discussed at a special meeting convened by the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, in which Japanese directors also participated. The heads of the various defense forces in the city will hold an important meeting soon to decide who will take over the US military defense zone after the withdrawal of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment. This is a matter of greatest concern to Chinese and foreign residents in the US military defense zone, and will be decided by the heads of the US, Italian, and Japanese defense forces stationed in Shanghai and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Since the authorities have recognized that next Tuesday or so is the date of the US military's withdrawal, this meeting is expected to be held in the latter half of this week or at the end of the week. As for whether the Japanese authorities intend to take over the US military defense zone, as they did when they took over the Western District after the British army withdrew last year, public speculation is rampant. The Japanese side does not formally express its attitude. An official said, "No one knows what the Japanese intend, or it may not be known until the meeting is held." However, according to qualified sources, they heard that the Japanese wanted to patrol the US military defense zone and would raise this wish at the upcoming meeting. Non-Japanese people want to keep the US military defense zone exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Police, because the police department's ability is sufficient to take on this role. The Shanghai Municipal Council hopes that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will take over the US military defense zone. The Corps is a civic group that is currently patrolling and stationed in Area "B". Whether it can be transferred to defend Area C as well needs to be carefully considered.

### Will Not Return After Withdrawal

Colonel Howard, commander of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, met with reporters the day before yesterday afternoon and said that since the US government has declared its intention to abandon extraterritorial rights in China when peace is restored, the US Marine Corps may not return to China. Judging from the China policy that Washington has already announced, unless the Chinese government feels that it is not able to protect American interests when normality is restored and asks the United States to send troops, the US military will return to China to perform garrison duties.

### Colonel Howard's Farewell Remarks

Colonel Howard also enthusiastically praised the spirit of cooperation and goodwill from all parties that he felt during his seven months in Shanghai, saying that he will regret leaving Shanghai, and all the officers and soldiers under his command feel the same way. During his command of the US military Fourth Regiment in Shanghai, the spirit of cooperation between the various defense forces was extremely strong. His policy was to work as closely as possible to maintain the peace and security of the entire International Settlement. This policy was not only applied to the defense forces within the settlement, but also to the Japanese army and gendarmerie outside the settlement. Although the Fourth Regiment may not return to China, the formation of the regiment has been for 25 years. Not only will it not be disbanded as a result, but it may even increase the number of soldiers to about 2,000.

### Commemorating the Second Air Defense Day

November 21 is China's Air Defense Day, and the second anniversary has arrived. Various places in the rear area are enthusiastically celebrating as in previous years, and consoling and providing relief to compatriots who have been victims of air raids, and strengthening air defense facilities. This city has decided not to hold any ceremonies due to its special environment. However, people with a sense of justice will automatically donate money and fulfill their responsibilities. At the same time, all sectors have decided to stand in silence in their original positions at noon on this day to mourn the national anti-air war martyrs and compatriots killed in air raids to express their condolences.

### National Government and British Agree to Establish Consulate in Hong Kong; Diao Zuqian Appointed Consul General, Established on December 1st

### When Using Bank of China Ten Yuan Notes, Check Carefully for Forgeries

Recently, a large number of forged 10-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China, printed in 1937 by the Ronan Luo Company, have been discovered. The difference between the forgeries and genuine notes lies in the clarity of the "portrait" lines on the front; the lines on the forgeries are thick and messy. Also, the circular colored pattern behind the centrally located characters "拾元" (Ten Yuan) is duller in color on the forgeries. On the back, the characters "中國銀行" (Bank of China) on the Bank of China Building are reversed in the forgeries but clear on genuine notes. The oval-shaped watermark "天壇圖" (Temple of Heaven) is visible when held up to the light on genuine notes, but visible externally on the forgeries. The police are paying close attention to these forgeries, and merchants and citizens should be vigilant.

### Exchange Equalization Board Announces Measures for Providing Commercial Foreign Exchange: Legitimate Commercial Drafts Not Yet Settled Can Also Be Approved at the Fixed Exchange Rate

The Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has recently announced measures for providing the foreign exchange needed for commercial purposes. It has notified the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Agricultural Bank, and the Fourth Bank to provide foreign exchange at the fixed exchange rates set by the Fund Committee: US$5.329 and British £3.325 to meet commercial needs, in order to increase supplies and stabilize prices. The original text of the eleven articles of the measures is as follows:

Foreign Exchange to Be Provided to the Greatest Extent Possible for Approved Commodities

Beginning September 15, 1941, for banks holding General Licenses No. 60 and No. 61 from the United States Treasury Department, the Fund will sell US dollars needed to import approved commodities into Free China (including freight and insurance) at the exchange rate of US$5.3211 per dollar. However, the sale of these US dollars must comply with the provisions of Section 2 of General License No. 61 of the United States Treasury Department. From September 15, 1941, for banks specially authorized by the Chinese Ministry of Finance, the Fund will sell British pounds needed to import approved commodities into Free China (including freight and insurance) at the exchange rate of £3.163. However, these imported goods must originate from the Sterling Area, and the recipient of this foreign exchange must be a resident of the Sterling Area. The selling price of foreign exchange by these licensed or authorized banks shall be US$5.329 and £3.325, and the buying price of foreign exchange shall be US$5.3211 and £1.2163.

Separate Provisions for Application Methods

Importers needing US dollars or British pounds for foreign exchange should complete an application form at the authorized bank, which will forward it to the General Office of the Fund in Chongqing, or the Hong Kong Office of the Fund, or the Fund's designated agencies in Free China, as well as agencies yet to be designated. Importers applying for foreign exchange must complete the application form according to the Fund's prescribed form. The banks are responsible for verifying that the information provided in the application form is detailed and accurate before forwarding it to the Fund for processing. Foreign exchange required for items listed in the list of prohibited imports announced by the Chinese Customs on July 4, 1939, and subsequent amendments and supplements, will not be approved, even with the approval of the Chinese government. (A) To facilitate the import of small-value commodities not on the prohibited import list, the Fund authorizes the banks to sell this foreign exchange, provided that the amount of each transaction does not exceed US$2,000 or £500. The banks must verify that the nature of these imported goods is truly legitimate. If the Fund inquires about a specific case, the bank should investigate and report the details of the case. (B) For individual needs such as remittances, travel expenses, insurance fees, etc., the Fund may approve the necessary foreign exchange required by any individual or family each month, but it will not exceed US$100 or £50. Additional needs may also be approved after verification. (C) The banks shall report the nature and amount of foreign exchange sold under items (A) and (B) above to the Fund weekly, according to the prescribed form.

Discretionary Provision of Foreign Exchange for Previously Concluded Contracts

A. The Fund may also discretionarily handle cases where legitimate commercial foreign exchange has been contracted before September 15, 1941, but has not yet been obtained in any way, especially those that have already been applied for or reported. B. The Fund may also discretionarily provide foreign exchange required for notes maturing on or after September 15, 1941, that have not yet been settled. However, this foreign exchange should be calculated after deducting the deposit already paid by the bank or importer. The banks shall trade at the US dollar and British pound exchange rates stipulated in this notice and shall not directly or indirectly use other exchange rates. A. If the banks purchase any foreign exchange on the market for the Fund, such as export drafts, checks, banknotes, coins, etc., they should do so at the prescribed prices of US$5.3211 or £3.32163, respectively, and report these transactions to the Fund weekly for verification. B. Applicants who have purchased foreign exchange from the Fund should sell any foreign exchange they have purchased on the market to the banks. Failure to comply will result in the Fund no longer approving the applicant's required foreign exchange. Importers must pay in cash when purchasing foreign exchange. Before selling foreign exchange, the banks should first verify whether the import procedures for goods being imported into Free China have been completed. Any foreign exchange obtained for legitimate purposes, whether used in full or in part, should be returned to the Fund at the original purchase price. For all cases of applications for US dollars or British pounds handled by the banks, after approval by the Fund, the banks should report the amount of national currency equivalent deposited by the applicant at any of the four banks to the Fund's Hong Kong office in the prescribed format for verification.

### Confident in Providing Food for the Entire City: 600,000 Bags of Stored Rice to Be Available; Rice Arriving After April to Be Stored

According to those in charge at the Municipal Council, the authorities of the two concessions are now highly confident in suppressing rice prices and stabilizing the overall food supply in Shanghai. Currently, over 600,000 bags of stored foreign rice are being sold at cost in rice shops. In addition to the existing grain reserves in the market, this is sufficient to last until February of next year. During these four months, the Rice Management Committee will ship in 250,000 bags of foreign rice monthly. In addition to supplying some of it to rice shops for retail sale, the rest will be stored for future needs. Therefore, citizens should not worry about the future of the food supply, but should not buy too much at once, so as not to reduce the available stock, otherwise they will easily fall into the trap of unscrupulous rice merchants.

Transport Permits Expired

Rice shops in the Public Concession that are short of rice have been ordered by the Rice Management Committee to start selling stored high-quality foreign rice from the 17th of this month, priced at 158.95 yuan per bag (224 pounds). Although each bag requires a payment of 160 yuan, the balance of 1.05 yuan per bag can be claimed from the original payment location the next day. Also, the validity date of the 198 transport permits used on the 17th has expired yesterday. All those with these permits must return them to the guild today and are not allowed to continue using them.

Rice Industry Meeting

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Guild and the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Guild will hold their fourth temporary emergency meeting at 10 AM today on the third floor of the Miscellaneous Grain Guild at 15 Edward Road to improve the sale of stored foreign rice by rice shops. Issues such as the sale of stored rice by rice shops and payment of rice funds will be discussed. The Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Guild held a meeting yesterday afternoon, but the specific decisions made must be agreed upon by the Bean and Rice and Miscellaneous Grain guilds before they can be implemented.

Urgent Reporting of Rice Reserves

The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the registration of rice reserves exceeding one month's worth of needs with the bureau, as stated in Public Notice No. 5587, is still in effect. Those who have delayed should register with the bureau immediately and without further delay. Registration forms can be obtained from the Grain Committee, Office No. 167 of the Municipal Council's General Office. Hotels, restaurants, and businesses should pay particular attention to this matter.

### Municipal Council Employees' Living Allowance Approved

According to a public notice from the Municipal Council's Information Office, the temporary living allowance for November, issued to employees of the bureau, has been approved as follows:

For Chinese employees without contracts, an allowance of 260% will be issued for the first 200 yuan of their monthly salary, and 220% for the remaining portion. The minimum allowance is set at 66 yuan. Rice subsidies will continue to be issued as usual.

For foreign employees and Chinese employees with contracts, an allowance of 260% will be issued for the first 500 yuan of their monthly salary, 220% for the next 500 yuan, and 170% for the remaining portion.

In addition, for married male employees with contracts whose monthly salary is 700 yuan or less, a marriage allowance of 20% will be added (minimum 100 yuan). For those with a monthly salary above 700 yuan but not exceeding 1250 yuan, a child allowance will be added, calculated at 50 yuan per child per month (maximum 100 yuan).

### A Business on Avenue Foch Receives a Hand Grenade

At around 3:30 PM yesterday, a person carrying a basket of fruit went to give a gift to the Yingji Business on Avenue Foch, Lane 197, No. 4 in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, after the person left, a cigarette tin was found inside, containing a hand grenade. Fortunately, it did not explode. The business reported the matter to the French police, who ordered detectives to take the grenade away for destruction.

### Kidnapping of Zhang Wenjun, Manager of Luen Wo Real Estate Company: Escaped After Being Kidnapped in Front of the Yangtze Hotel the Night Before and Encountering Japanese Troops in the Countryside

A kidnapping case occurred the night before (the 17th) at the intersection of Hankou Road and Yunnan Road in the Public Concession. At the time, no one knew about it, and the police did not receive a report. It was not until yesterday that the kidnapped person escaped and revealed the incident to the outside world. The following is an investigation by the reporter of this newspaper:

Owns a Car and Drives Himself

Zhang Wenjun, a 38-year-old from Wuxi, lives at 523 Hart Road in the Public Concession. He works as the manager of the Luen Wo Real Estate Company at No. 412 on the fourth floor of the Shenda Building at 89 Fuzhou Road. The company was established by the wealthy Zhang family of Nanxun. Zhang usually drives his own car, No. 929, for the convenience of his work.

Kidnapped Suddenly at the Hotel Entrance

At around 9 PM the night before, Zhang left a friend's place in a certain number of the Yangtze Hotel at the intersection of Hankou Road and Yunnan Road. As he stepped out the door and was about to get into his car, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from behind him. Two were wearing long robes, and one was wearing a Western suit. They pulled out two guns and threatened him not to make a sound. He was forced into the car, which was driven west by one of the kidnappers. When they reached the Tianqiao (Overpass) at Xujiahui, they stopped the car and got out.

Taken to a Farmer's House for the Night

Zhang was held by two kidnappers as they crossed the wire fence and entered the Chinese territory. At the same time, he saw his own car speeding away, driven by the kidnapper, to an unknown destination. At around 11 PM that night, in the pouring rain, Zhang was taken by the kidnappers to a village near Jinji Bridge and spent the night in a thatched house. The next morning, the two kidnappers urged Zhang to get up and questioned him about whether he was a member of the Zhang family of Nanxun. Zhang stated that he was from Wuxi, but the kidnappers did not believe him.

Escaped near Caojia Garden

At around 8 AM, one of the kidnappers walked with Zhang towards Caojia Garden in Caohaijing, holding a gun. Zhang saw that the kidnapper's gun was hidden behind his waistband and planned to escape. Soon after, they saw two Japanese soldiers patrolling and shouted for help. The soldiers arrested the kidnapper and took him and the victim to their headquarters. Zhang was finally safe. It is reported that the arrested kidnapper's name is Fang Xuxian, 26 years old, from Nanhui, and he claimed that the case was instigated by a fugitive named Mo. Zhang has now safely returned home, but the whereabouts of the missing car are still unknown.

### Investigation into the Fratricide Case Yesterday: Xu Daquan Remains Silent

The French police conducted a public investigation yesterday morning at 9:30 AM into the tragic death of Xu Songyao, the young owner of the Huamei Pharmacy, with the main suspect, the murderer Xu Daquan, brought to the court. Xu was still wearing a grey wool-lined long robe and looked even thinner than the last time he was seen. However, he remained manic and incoherent, silent throughout, and did not say a word. He was then asked to sit down and instructed to write, but Xu held the brush for about half an hour without being able to write a single character. When the axe he used to commit the crime was shown to him, he showed no reaction and did not take it. It is said that since Xu was arrested and detained by the police, although he eats and drinks as usual, he has remained silent and unable to speak. Therefore, the investigation yesterday could not proceed. It has now been rescheduled to the 2nd of next month. Xu Daquan will be returned to police custody. As for Xu's father, Xu Xiangsun, and Bao Tan Lu Zanyuan, Tan Mu Xu Kaitao, and the photographer of fingerprints Chen Zixin (known as Lao Guangdong), and Miao Xiangjia, the secretary of Tongren Fuyuantang, who are suspected of being involved in the case, were all arrested by the police for investigation. Among them, Xu Kaitao has been released as he is not suspected of any crime. The rest of the people

Public Investigation

But Xu Xiangsun was suffering from hemoptysis and was specially approved by the police to be transferred to Wang Qizhang Sanatorium for treatment. He was not present yesterday. According to the police investigation, since the case occurred, it was found that there were illegal activities involving false identification during the examination of the corpse, so the police immediately started investigating. First, they sent Western detectives to Baolong Hospital to investigate, and only then did they learn that Xu Songyao's body was indeed not sent to Tongren Fuyuantang for examination. And this matter was entirely done by Zhong Bingchang, a police officer of No. 152 who is on the run, and Lu Zanyuan, a police officer of No. 193 who was arrested.

One-Handedly

Later, because the family of the deceased Xu Songyao requested the police to waive the examination, the police refused, and the two detectives came up with the means of replacing the corpse with a nameless male corpse that had died on the road, pretending to be Xu Songyao's body. On the one hand, they colluded with Chen Zixin, the fingerprint photographer, and Miao, the secretary of Tongren Fuyuantang, to help commit fraud, so that the corpse examination was completely concealed. It is said that Xu Xiangsun gave a huge bribe at that time, so now the police are prosecuting Xu Xiangsun for concealing and destroying evidence and using bribery. And because Xu was absent without reason today, he will be arrested again.

Add to Detention

Re-detained in the police station for investigation at any time, it is said, as for the detective Lu Zanyuan, and Chen Zixin, Miao Xiangjia, the police have been accused of freezing their jobs, and according to Miao Xiangjia, this matter was completely entrusted by the detective Zhong Bingchang, helping to fill in the body form, at that time, he did not know that Xu's body was a false one, and he did not receive any bribes. Chen Zixin confessed that on the morning of October 27, he was sent by the police to Tongren Fuyuantang to take photos of the corpse examination. When he arrived, Zhong Bingchang asked to waive the photo of Xu Songyao's body, which I refused. Zhong then moved Xu Jingyao's corpse and the car driver's corpse from the mortuary and placed them together, and I took the photos back.

I Don't Know It's Fake

Finally, Zanyuan confessed that when investigating the case, it was originally Detective Xu Kaitao who sent Detective No. 179 to investigate. I was only helping to fill in an investigation report, and it was entirely based on the Bao Long Hospital's injury report that Xu Songyao fell to his death and the car driver Zheng Ali suffered from pulmonary hemorrhage and cerebral congestion. The next morning, I was sent to Fuyuantang to monitor the body, but I didn't know about the fake thing. As a result, because the investigation still needs to continue, it was rescheduled to October 2, and all the defendants were returned to the police station.

### Assassination Case on Avenue Lafayette Last Night: One Man Shot Dead

An assassination case suddenly occurred at the foot of the iron gate wall of Sansan Village in Lane 1254, Avenue Lafayette, French Concession, at around 10:45 PM last night. The victim was a young man, whose name is unknown, about 30 years old, wearing blue western-style trousers. There were three or four murderers ambushing there. When they saw the victim arriving, they pulled out their guns and fired three or four shots. One bullet hit his chest, and one bullet pierced his brain, and he died on the spot. After the incident, the murderers fled to Zhangjia Lane behind without a trace. A certain Russian in No. 7 of the neighborhood suddenly heard the sound of gunfire and opened the window to investigate. He saw a Chinese youth being shot to death at the foot of the opposite wall, and then reported it to the French police by telephone, ordering Chinese and Western detectives to rush there, but the murderers were gone. They found the bullet shells at the scene of the incident and brought them back for investigation. At the same time, they used a hearse to transport the corpse to Guangci Hospital and transferred it to the small ward on Talas Road for examination. The police are investigating the cause of the assassination.

### Shanghai YMCA Appeals for Winter Clothing Donations

In order to relieve the poor, the Shanghai YMCA has launched a fundraising campaign to make winter clothes and distribute them to the poor in the city. It is heard that the association has been actively raising donations. As of yesterday, donations from all walks of life have been enthusiastic, and the total amount has reached more than 9,000 yuan. However, the goal of 30,000 yuan is still far away, and the weather is gradually getting colder, and the poor women and children urgently need winter clothes and quilts, and they also hope that the philanthropists from all walks of life will donate as soon as possible so that the good deeds can be completed as soon as possible.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory predicted the weather at 4:30 PM yesterday, saying that there is tropical air in southeastern China, and Shandong is sunny and clear, with strong northwest winds turning sharp. Here, it will turn from sunny and warm to cloudy, with morning fog and south to west winds. The coastal area south of Ma'an Island will be sunny, with gentle southeast winds. There is a cyclone and rain in North Korea due to the low pressure passing east or northeast. Also, in the 14 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Mupu was 79.9 and the lowest was 59.7. On the same day last year, the highest was 64.0 and the lowest was 41.8.

### Glider Pilots Gather in Guilin to Participate in the Establishment of the Guilin Branch; Wei Dinglie and Others Arrive in Guilin to Perform Stunts; The General Association Enrolls Students in Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, and Guilin

(Guilin Aviation News) Young glider pilots Wei Dinglie, Wei Dingzhi, Wen Qijun, Zhou Shengke, and others flew from Rong to Zhijiang on October 27th to perform, and then towed gliders to Guilin to perform stunts at the establishment ceremony of the Guilin Provincial Gliding Branch, according to Instructor Wei Dinglie, the youth of Hunan and Guangxi are very enthusiastic about gliding, this special performance of gliding technology is to promote it, and to explain to all sectors the importance of gliding and its relationship with national defense, the Chinese gliding advocate Martyr Wei Chao, the director of the Aviation Committee Gliding Training Class Li Dajing and others, are all Guangxi people, this flight to Guilin to perform is extremely exciting.

Also, the number of students enrolled in the second phase in Guilin has increased, reaching sixty, with women expected to account for one-third. Efforts are also being made to enrich the equipment. Soon, a parachute tower as high as 1,000 meters will be completed for students to practice. The detailed rules and dates for the second phase of enrollment will be announced soon. It is planned to recruit 15 to 20 students in Guilin. All high school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications can apply. Enrollment will be conducted in Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, and Guilin across the country. Training will begin in Chengdu on New Year's Day next year. The number of places to be recruited this time will not be able to fulfill the wishes of all young people in the country, so in the future, we should strive to establish branches and sub-branches everywhere and hold various short-term training classes on the spot, such as summer training classes, so that a large number of young students can take advantage of their vacations to study and research, so that the gliding movement can be universally developed. The General Association has ordered 20 gliders in a certain place, and Guilin can be assigned several for backup in the future. Two or three of the first phase students will also be sent to Guilin to work soon. Regarding education, according to Instructor Wen Qijun, the second phase of courses is exactly the same as the first phase, but the learning period is extended by one month. The first phase is ten months of graduation, and the second month is designated as the enlistment period. In a more ample time, it is planned to enrich the content of each subject. Nine subjects have been set: Gliding Science (gliding principle, theory and technology), Navigation Science, Flight Rules, Insurance Umbrella (the above four subjects are to explain the methods and techniques that must be known during on-the-spot gliding), Instrument Science (studying the structure and device of instruments in the aircraft), Glider Science (teaching the reasons and methods of glider structure), Mechanical Drawing (using triangles and geometry to draw various patterns), Meteorology (studying the relationship between climate and navigation), Mechanical Practice (students actually learn to build gliders and learn to repair them).

### Introduction: Ding Guangxie Painting Exhibition

— Wu Yisheng

Mr. Ding Guangxie has held several personal exhibitions in the past, with scenery as the main theme. This year I came to Shanghai permanently, and it happened that I was fortunate enough to see his solo exhibition at the New Shanghai Company. After viewing it, I felt that Mr. Ding is not just a landscape painter, but also an explorer of the mysteries of nature, like a scientist. He sings the harmony and evolution of nature, but he is like a poet. In Mr. Ding's works, there is a strong pastoral sentiment, which is the characteristic of his landscape paintings. And his transparent sense of color and a kind of soft poetic charm from nature are the valuable artistic achievements of Mr. Ding.

This time, Mr. Ding's solo exhibition is of course mostly landscape paintings. Those more than one hundred harmonious, purified, and profound pictures are all records of the beauty and harmony that an artist has experienced in the life of nature. There is no pretense or deception, just like what Corot's paintings tell us.

The British writer Kingsley said, "Don't miss an opportunity to view any beauty." "Beauty" is God's great masterpiece. How should the poor people who are suffocating in a smoggy city for four years cherish this exhibition of Mr. Ding?

Because McLeans cannot participate in the defense of the country, the interest in competition has been reduced. Furthermore, the two powerful Chinese teams, Paramount and Huxing, have not yet completed the procedures, or they may participate, then there will be seven teams competing in Group A. Among the Group A teams, the United Stars team was initiated and organized by Tao Bolinji, the former Little Bear team, and is a mixed team of Chinese and Western famous players.

### Foreign Flour Is Reluctant to Sell Cheaply; Rice and Flour Sales Show Some Promise

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan Wheel and the Qiongzhou Jiaying Wheel arrived at the same day earlier. The large amount of foreign rice and sugar loaded on the Qiongzhou and Qingyuan Wheels has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that there are still 5,100 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, all of which are the Shanghai Municipal Council's cheap small rice. Yesterday, there was no market for foreign rice. Due to inconvenient transportation, domestic rice also lacked transactions in the market, except for a few embellishments.

Mr. Zhou Xigeng sent a letter to this newspaper saying that since the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession implemented the import rice price limit of 130 yuan per stone, the civilians of the isolated island have been clapping their hands and cheering, praising their merits. It is not easy to achieve this effect without the concerted efforts of the two Concession authorities. However, this matter is of great importance, and at the beginning of the process, there are many clues. Although it is inevitable that some places will be criticized, it is natural. However, this is not a disease for the authorities. It is generally believed that the cost of rice imported by the Shanghai Municipal Council is recently based on the foreign exchange obtained from the application, which is calculated at several yuan per unit. What price is the foreign exchange settled at? What price is the rice calculated at? According to the document submitted by the Bean and Grain Trade Association to the two Concession authorities, the cost of small rice settled at the statutory foreign exchange rate is 110 yuan. If the black market foreign exchange rate is used to calculate the cost of small rice, it will be more than 170 yuan. Also, the price of rice imported by the Shanghai Municipal Council has increased from 117 yuan to 130 yuan. Is this due to the high cost of water transportation? In the past, the Shanghai Municipal Council would announce the reasons for the price increase of imported rice, but this is not the case. And since the sale of foreign rice has been handled, I don't know how the profit and loss is. If there is a loss, how to raise funds to compensate? How to distribute the profit? This is also what the citizens are concerned about. Since the authorities announced that from November 15th, anyone who transports more than one bag of flour in the Public Concession or the French Concession will be punished without a permit from the authorities. Please apply to the authorities for a flour transportation permit, paying a fee of two cents per bag, in order to restrict the movement of flour inside and outside the boundary. I strongly agree. However, there are still some issues to be discussed regarding the application for permits. If flour merchants ship goods to flour mills or flour warehouses, the quantity is always more than one bag, so they must first obtain a permit for future reference. However, if the goods are delivered to the store, they cannot be sold out immediately in fact. If the initial permit has expired, and then a customer needs to buy more than one bag of flour, they must apply for a permit before delivery can be made. Calculated in this way, each bag of flour adds a permit fee of four cents. According to the principles of commodity sales, it will inevitably be added to the cost, and its ultimate goal is undoubtedly to pass it on to consumers. At a time when the authorities are reducing the burden on the common people, I think it is necessary to review it. Also, the permit for the movement of rice and grain within the boundary is not charged, while the movement of flour within the boundary requires a fee. It is already favoring one over the other, or is the flour already subject to customs duties or unified taxes of one cent per bag when it enters the warehouse and leaves the factory, which can proceed unimpeded? Then, there is a question as to whether there is a conflict between the Shanghai Municipal Council's need for a handling fee of one cent per bag. In short, benevolence and virtue are admirable. I stand purely and do not care about the rhetoric, with good intentions and hopes. Foreign flour is added to the market due to the actual consumption needs of this street. Some of the American flour that the foreign gangs are waiting to load has been certified by the authorities and can be declared and shipped. Therefore, people's hearts have turned to peace. Owners are no longer in a hurry to sell cheaply. American flour is about to arrive at the Pao Tai at a price of 4.1 yuan. Golden Dragon was initially very sluggish, but later, as American flour transferred stations, there was daily zeroing in this street, so it also sold for 37 to 38 yuan, with a total of one or two thousand bags traded. Wheat bran continued to rise, and small bags continued to sell for half a yuan.

### Wholesale of Yellow Beans Arrives; Oil Hoarders Revive

Edible oil: Actual consumption households have slightly increased their purchases, and hoarding stomachs are also good, so the market trend has turned to rise. As a result, it has risen by more than ten yuan compared to the previous time. The city's accomplishments include 20 barrels of Dalian bean oil, 37 barrels of Jiangbei bean oil, 300 cans of raw oil, 200 cans of Yantai raw oil, nearly a thousand dan of Qingyou from the Dayou Factory, 500 dan of vegetable oil, and 300 barrels of vegetable oil from the Rihua Factory.

A considerable amount of yellow beans has arrived in the port recently, so the market trend has loosened. Yesterday, Chen Jinyuan from Tianjin was handled by this street and the Xiamen gang for 200 bags, and another 500 bags of Xinjinyuan, the price fell by three or four yuan compared to the previous time. Another 1,860 bags of beans and 5,360 bags of bean cake were shipped to Singapore.

### No Black Market Transactions; Japanese and American Notes Fall Together

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: the Central Bank and HSBC's listed prices were both flat, and the price of HSBC's small counter remained unchanged. The local exchange in the black market of British and American exchange in the black market still has no development. The British gold in New York is one pound and 125, and the US exchange is three yuan, still there is supply but no demand, and no transactions have been made.

Tianjin, 18th (Tuesday) Electric, this morning the market opened smoothly, and the telegraphic transfers of London and New York have not changed. Shen exchange fell by five corners, to seventy-seven yuan, and Lian banknote between disk up one yuan and five corners, to forty-seven yuan angle.

Hong Kong, 18th (Tuesday) Electric, this morning the exchange market opened very steadily, and there is still no change.

Yesterday's foreign currency market: British and American gold pounds continued to plummet by 20 yuan with the cash price, and the British gold bill was still flat. Although the US gold bill once fell to 32.5 yuan, it then returned to 33.2 yuan, only one corner less than the previous day. The trend of Hong Kong bills is still stable, and the market price is standing flat. The Japanese gold bill has fallen again, and the evening market has retreated to 3.25 yuan, while the Korean bill has risen, and the evening market has also risen to 3.25 yuan.

### The Situation Is Unfavorable for Gold; The Low Price Almost Breaks Through the 18,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's cash red market fell more and more miserably, and the price has fallen wildly into the 19,000 yuan mark, and several times it was dangerous to break through the 18,000 yuan mark again. All parties are still extremely weak. The US-Japan negotiations were beneficial to the sellers, and the Hong Kong Dajin and other gangs saw high and violently sold. Although the bank gangs continued to enter, Dafeng entered more than 500 taels, and Mingfeng Tianwu each entered about 400 taels, but Shi He Xianghe Qian Duiye each sold more than 500 taels. The price hovered and retreated from 19,790 yuan to a low price of 18,100 yuan in the afternoon. Although it was forcibly raised, the closing price continued to be 1,090 yuan lower. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,780 taels. Jewelry fell by 80 yuan, to 1,920 yuan. The secret market of silver fell to 23 yuan.

Hot Red Market with Light Rain

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 9:00 a.m. at 19,750 yuan, which is 50 yuan higher. After the opening, a selling wave suddenly rose, and the price plummeted. Shihe Yifeng Shunyuan Mingfeng Tianyuan Xianghe sold violently, and the price plummeted 1,250 yuan, entering the 19,000 yuan mark, falling to 18,500 yuan. Defu Dingcheng Decheng was seen absorbing, and Tianyuan Mingfeng re-entered, so a recovery wave started, and the step rose to 100 yuan, seeing 19,000 yuan. Yifeng Shihe Shunyuan Decheng Tianyuan moved in the selling wave, and the price fell sharply by 700 yuan again, falling to 18,300 yuan. At noon, Yongcheng Xianghe Tianjin raised it to 18,600 yuan, and Shunyuan Lianxing sold it out. The noon closing price was raised to 18,450 yuan. The opening price at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon was 150 yuan lower, at 18,200 yuan. In the selling wave, it retreated to 18,100 yuan again. Tianyuan Shunyuan Dafeng vigorously raised, and the price rose sharply by 750 yuan, coaxing to 18,900 yuan. Xianghe sold it vigorously, and the closing price at 4:00 p.m. was 18,650 yuan, which was 1,050 yuan lower than the closing price on the previous day. It has been two days of light rain, with a total sharp drop of 2,650 yuan. There was a high and low of 1,650 yuan on the same day. The market price of the cash shop's own brand Jinmen was 19,000 yuan, and the purchase price was 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.

### After the Splendor of Public Bonds, They Return to Mediocrity

The public bond secret market yesterday rose sharply and returned slightly, showing a slight fatigue. This is also a necessary step. Probably because there was no news from the start of the US-Japan negotiations, most of the market participants were watching and waiting. Most of the transactions in the market were scalping in and out frequently. Type C also rushed out of the 70 yuan mark once, but it still broke in. The trend may be slightly hovering. In the morning yesterday, Jiufeng had a considerable buying interest, and Lianhe and Tongkang followed suit. Bingjie also raised to more than 70 yuan. However, Yuancheng and Runde sold out, and Baolong's spot even flowed out, breaking into the pass and even breaking nine yuan once. The noon closing price was half a yuan. In the afternoon, Jiufeng continued to buy, and Renfeng also had a need for Runde and Shilong to continue selling, and Lianhe turned out. Hu Heji also had sales requests, but customers continued to buy. The market price slightly recovered. The price results were slightly returned to two or three corners to six corners uniformly. The total transaction volume was about 2.3 million yuan. The following is a brief table:

Category Maximum Minimum Closing Compared to Previous Day Tongjia 76.10 5.50 75.60 Down 0.40 Tongyi 71.30 70.50 70.90 Again 0.2 Tongbing 70.10 Station 8.95 69.30 Again 0.30 Tongding 65.75 65.00 65.10 Again 0.60 Tongwu 69.40 68.00 68.65 Again 0.35

In stock trading, 60 shares of Tianchu MSG Factory were traded at a price of 365 yuan per share.

### The Multi-Party Is Hesitant and Does Not Move Forward; The Yarn Market Is Temporarily Quiet

The yarn market is stable. This is because after a big up and down, the trend has turned to calm. The new sellers are because their bottom is low, and although the raw materials have also declined, the yarn prices now differ too much from the cost, and the factory not only cannot make a profit, but also loses money. Therefore, the excitement of the new shorts has been greatly reduced, so the yarn market has turned to quiet. However, some of them are still struggling on the short side, so the advance and retreat force is quite strong. The high price of 20 counts of Shuangma is 1,675 yuan, and the low price is 2,575 yuan.

Shuangma Morning Open, the market image is peaceful, at 2,600 yuan. After a while, it fell to 2,585 yuan, but there are quite a few people doing more. In a flash, it rose to 2,645 yuan. After hearing that the exchange opened flat, it saw a slight decline, and the market situation became tired again, gradually loosening to 2,575 yuan. Unexpectedly, at the closing of the third market, the exchange's yarn and cloth all rebounded, and people's hearts were greatly shaken. The shorts rose up to cover, and Shuangma gradually advanced to 2,675 yuan. However, the price was too high, and a batch of profitable people vomited it out, loosening to 2,610 yuan to close the market. The daytime turnover statistics were 2,950 yuan.

The afternoon opened at 2,610 yuan, "but the shorts on the floor were unusually active, once falling to 2,575 yuan. Later, after hearing that the exchange's yarn and cloth all rose, it rose to 2,635 yuan, loosening again to 2,605 yuan, but the closing price rose again to 2,632 yuan.

The situation of the Golden Shuangma futures market is exempt from ups and downs, and the trend is slightly firm in the hovering. After the return, there is still no significant development in the ring, so the buyer is hesitant and the potential for pulling up is weakening. The shorts are blocked by the news and are also more cautious. The market atmosphere rises and falls, and seems to be waiting for development in brewing. When the morning opened, the November period was 2,390 yuan. After the floating short's compensation, it once reached a high of 2,440 yuan, and then fell back to December. After opening at 2,500 yuan, it gradually rose, but it also reached 2,600 yuan. The forward first did 2,650 yuan, and later, after securities and gold gangs once acquired it, it rose to 2,715 yuan. After entering, retail investors handed it over one after another, and the trend softened again. The noon closing price was small to 2,360 yuan in the near term, 2,530 yuan in December, and 2,640 yuan in January. In the afternoon, the factory orders and the exchange were relatively firm, and people's hearts were stable. The intention to buy was strong, and the market price hovered firmly. The periods for each month saw a rebound. As a result of the ups and downs throughout the day, the near term rose by 15 yuan, the December period rose by 5 yuan, and the January period fell sharply by 10 yuan.

### The Cotton Market Starts to Improve

The current cotton situation has improved slightly. The price of coarse cotton has rebounded by 10 yuan, but the public is still unwilling to sell at an excessive loss and is still taking a wait-and-see attitude. Trading can also be prosperous. The following is a record of the fluctuations in the prices of each cotton in the flower number room yesterday:

Brazil 100 pieces 200.0 Warehouse Delivery

Brazil 200 pieces 275.0 Warehouse Delivery

Lan Palace 200 pieces 575.0 Warehouse Delivery

Lan Palace 100 pieces 560.0 Warehouse Delivery

Lan Palace 100 pieces 545.0 Warehouse Delivery

Lan Palace 100 pieces 540.0 Warehouse Delivery

New York Cotton Market: The market situation first fell due to the south gang's hedging and floating more selling, and then slightly rose due to New Orleans buying and the industry compensating. As a result, yesterday's closing price fell by about ten pounds.

### The Sugar Futures Market is Controlled, Business is Stalled Invisibly

Yesterday morning, the spot sugar market continued to rise. October imports rose directly from 260 yuan to 272 yuan, then to 262 yuan, a rise of 13 yuan. September rose from 248 yuan to 270 yuan, then to 260 yuan. August rose from 250 yuan to 268 yuan, then to 256 yuan. The most recent November arrival started at 275 yuan, then 278 yuan, then 261 yuan. Hong Kong crude rose from 230 yuan to 239 yuan, a rise of 5 yuan. Dutch red rose from 210 yuan to 203 yuan, a rise of 3 yuan. By the afternoon, there was a possibility of the futures market opening, but due to control by a certain party, trading was not allowed below 272 yuan, causing all business to stall invisibly. Only over 5,000 bags of spot goods were traded in the morning.

### Fresh Fruit Arrives in Succession, Dried Fruit Also Has a Source

Recently, the source of fresh fruit has been continuous. Since the listing of Huangyan Shantou mandarin oranges, early oranges from Dongting Mountain have also arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the market price ranged from 180 yuan to about 200 yuan. There are also imported mandarin oranges with an asking price of about 200 yuan per 100 market pounds. However, the arrival of raw pears is not much, and the price has risen slightly, with an asking price of 270-280 yuan, and the base price being 140 yuan. The arrival of Xiamen pomelos is relatively abundant, and the price has weakened, with an asking price of 230 yuan. Banana arrivals are not strong, sales are smooth, and the price is very brisk, with an asking price of 230-240 yuan. The apple market is stable, with "Wa Jin" apples opening at 45-46 yuan per box, and "Guo Guang" apples at 57-58 yuan. There are also Jintai oranges that arrived yesterday, with an asking price of 120-130 yuan, which is 30-40% higher than last year's market price. In addition, Tianjin's new hawthorns are priced at 46-47 yuan per 100 pounds, which is still considered stable.

On the 18th, 910 bags of imported raw peanuts, 408 bags of walnuts, and 365 bags of chestnuts arrived, all from Tianjin.

### The Female Calamities of the Political and Legal Circles

— Dan Xin

This newspaper's "European War Miscellany" has been publishing a translation of "The Female Calamities of the French Political Circle" for several days. What is described within truly makes one sigh endlessly. In fact, anyone who abandons their natural calling and only seeks the pleasures of sights, sounds, and hedonism is simply ruining themselves.

Liberal France has its glorious past and should also have its bright future. These "female calamity" phenomena are a clear example of "worrying about the country leads to prosperity, while indulging in pleasure leads to ruin." As long as they can bury themselves in hard work, this is still a beneficial lesson. The facts of the female calamities are such, but ultimately it should still be the men who blame themselves. Although food and sex are natural, men should strive for self-improvement.

Looking at the ladies of Shanghai, they indulge in dance halls and bars all day long. The times have already sent these dregs into the trash can, but these dregs are still content with life in the trash can and do not regret it. The result will only be eternal ruin. We hope that the Chinese youths who are intoxicated in pink dreams will immediately wake up, as they are not far off course. Do not embark on a path of self-destruction from which you cannot extricate yourselves.

The children of the times should aim to serve the masses. Today, many Chinese heroic sons and daughters are rising up for the national crisis to fulfill their mission of the times. Therefore, we are confident that the Chinese nation will be able to overcome any difficulties and cultivate our flowers of freedom and fruits of happiness.

### Such a Reputable Landlord—Demanding Rent Calculated in US Dollars?

To the Honorable Editor: I am suffering greatly due to the unreasonable oppression of my landlord regarding the housing issue. I rented the current house on November 1st of last year from a Ningbo landlord, Mr. Ying (formerly a shipping merchant, a nouveau riche after the war, now specializing in real estate and hoarding due to the interruption of shipping) and using the name of Jin Di Real Estate Company. He lives upstairs in the connected rooms, three rooms in the front and back, and the rest are rented out to others. At that time, I rented a large and small room on the lower floor and a pavilion room upstairs, a total of three rooms of various sizes, for a monthly rent of 157 yuan, including water, electricity, and donations, for a term of six months. After the six-month term expired, he immediately demanded a rent increase of ten yuan, so I gave up the room upstairs and lived downstairs, the rent was not increased, but an additional electricity fee of three yuan was added, making the monthly rent 160 yuan. That room upstairs was soon rented out for a monthly rent of 60 yuan. Moreover, this time he only allowed a term of three months. After the term expired, he increased the rent by 30 yuan again, making it 190 yuan, and still only allowed a term of three months. Because it was difficult to find a house, and it always required tips, and my children were all working and studying nearby, I reluctantly agreed to the increase. By the end of this month, the term will expire again, and he notified me a few days ago that he would increase the rent by 110 yuan per month, making the total monthly rent a huge 300 yuan. When I immediately asked for the reason for the rent increase, he said it was calculated based on the black market US dollar exchange rate, and said that if I did not move out after the term expired, he would calculate according to the new rent. I am a retired bank employee, unable to work due to illness, and my daily life depends entirely on pensions and a small amount of savings from before the war, which is already very difficult, how can I withstand such an increase in expenses? Moreover, after the fall of Yuan Lai (Wujin), all my houses and utensils were mostly destroyed, and I am already homeless. I have never argued with anyone, I don't know if I can refuse this unreasonable rent increase. After the term expires, will there still be a deadline for moving out? The other tenants living together also feel the same way. The landlord receives more than 800 yuan per month in rent for the entire building, and the expenses are only water and electricity bills, housing donations, and a small amount of repair costs. At this time of national crisis, we should be in the same boat and overcome this difficulty together. As fellow countrymen, we should not use the US dollar as an excuse to increase the rent. Unexpectedly, he has repeatedly increased the rent, but still cannot satisfy his desires. I have always admired your newspaper for upholding justice and serving society. I would like to borrow a corner to make this situation public to the masses. With respect, Li Zhenzhi.

Editor's note: This kind of landlord is greedy and unreasonable beyond words, truly deserving of condemnation. As a fellow countryman, he does not think about being in the same boat through thick and thin, but wants to squeeze people to the point of desperation with the houses obtained from profiting from the national crisis. Considering the law and human feelings, how can this be fair? For now, as long as the tenants are united, go through legal procedures, formally question him in writing, and provide evidence to point out the relationship between the real estate company and the landlord, let's see if he still has the face to settle in foreign exchange? Now the prices of bread, milk powder, gasoline, and soap, all daily necessities, electricity bills, and land donations are falling, what reason is there for the rent to rise alone? The three-month lease term is a mere threat that everyone knows. This should also be argued and canceled during serious negotiations. Finally, if he ignores it, you can sue the authorities.

### Prohibition of Renting Out Kitchens

— Qiu Lai

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, due to the surge in population, there has been a shortage of houses. Generally, second landlords take the opportunity to make profits, dividing the houses horizontally and vertically, turning them into pigeon coop style; it seems that the purpose of living is just to sleep, and everything else besides sleeping, such as washing, drying, and cooking, is not needed at all. Single or double-story lane houses usually only have one tap, and when more people live there, they grab and snatch from each other, making it unbearable in the first half of the day; the roof and the patio are covered with houses and awnings, and there is no place to dry clothes; the rooms are as small as snail shells, with some of the simplest furniture, and if you want to take a few steps, you will be like a ram trapped in a fence, unable to move forward or backward. As for cooking, most of the kitchens are rented out, and residents have to burn kerosene stoves and coal stoves in their rooms. Therefore, fires in the concession occur frequently. Burning down the house is not the only problem, because of the stacked beds and houses, it is difficult to escape, and people are often burned to death.

The concession authorities prohibit the construction of houses on the roof (but in fact, many are still built), and there have also been discussions about prohibiting the construction of lofts, but there has been no prohibition on renting out kitchens, which is a major oversight. The kitchen is originally a place for cooking, so the buildings are mostly walls, which are not easy to burn; and the water pipe is close at hand, so even if you are careless, it is easy to extinguish. The rooms are full of boxes, wardrobes, and many board walls, lofts, and if you are not careful, it will become a prairie fire; and it is inconvenient to fetch water, often causing a disaster due to the failure to rescue in time. Now the concession authorities are strictly prohibiting the hoarding of flammable materials to prevent fires, which is indeed a good policy. I hope that at the same time, the greedy second landlords will also be curbed, prohibiting them from renting out rooms to tenants without restriction, and renting out the kitchen to make profits!

### Roadside Report

— Inspector

On Beile Road in the French Concession, there is a certain business that usually keeps its doors tightly closed, seemingly deserted. Recently, the front of the business has been crowded with people, which suddenly looks lively. It turns out that the business is selling the rice it hoarded before at a flat price, hence this scene. Several slogans are posted in front of the business. One on the left reads: "Haha! We are going to sell flat-priced rice!" The tone is quite novel and imposing; the word "haha" can better convey the spirit.

### A Record of Buying Milk Powder

— Jue Min

My younger brother is sick. According to the doctor, it is the result of insufficient nutrition and needs to be supplemented with milk.

Today, I happened to see the news that "Jishi Foreign Company stipulates that Klining milk powder is 70 yuan per 5-pound can." I thought about it for a long time and felt that I could barely afford it. After getting off work, I went to the accounting department to withdraw 70 silver dollars and wanted to buy a can to try. I knew that after walking through all the major companies and pharmacies, they all unanimously replied "no." The strangest thing is that a certain pharmacy even asked for 70 yuan for a 2.5-pound can. Only China-France Pharmacy was able to abide by the price limit and once sold me a bottle for 70 yuan, but it had to be opened on the spot to prevent hoarding. According to the clerk in the store, "If we sell it to hoarders without opening it, we can get 120 yuan, but for the sake of commercial ethics, China-France does not adopt this method." No wonder the previous few companies were unwilling to sell it to me.

The spirit of China-France Pharmacy in abiding by the law and standing out from the crowd is truly worthy of our praise. Finally, I hope that all sectors will introduce the cheapest stores and expose stores that do not follow the price limit. The wave of rising prices can always be alleviated a little bit.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fourteen, The Hero's Life of Fighting

That night, he had to tell the head martial arts actor of the Red Stage what Xiao Jiqing had told him on the first day, and how those martial arts actors had been playing tricks on Begonia these past three days. He knew that this person was very experienced and had considerable influence in Shanghai. Zhang Yincai, who was usually so fierce, could not help but bow his head when he saw him. As long as he was willing to say a word, this misunderstanding could be resolved immediately, and Begonia would no longer have to suffer so much idleness.

After listening to the words of the martial arts manager, that person was indeed very dissatisfied, and when the show ended that night, he really reprimanded Zhang Yincai a few words.

Only then did Zhang Yincai understand that Begonia was introduced by the small boss, and he could not help but regret it a bit. From then on, he treated Begonia much more kindly; not to mention the martial arts actors under him, who were all acting according to his demeanor. When he became kind to Begonia, others would no longer insult him.

However, this only resolved half of Begonia's pain. His physical strength was still not enough for the big falls and fights every day, especially when it came to the end of the fight. All the martial arts actors routinely had to perform a set of "Tiger Boat Rowing." Twenty or thirty people were rolling and tumbling on the stage like turning a top. The movements were very fast, and if they were a little late, they would easily bump into or be pressed down by others; and as long as one person made a mistake, the others would be affected immediately, and there would be a thunderous cheer from the audience. (266)

The author talked with Mr. Wei in the rehearsal room about his ideas when writing Wu Sangui. He said, "I write Wu Sangui to restore him to his original appearance as a hero, but this hero is a 'individualistic' hero, so he will only plan for himself, wanting to transform from a high-ranking official to a feudal ruler who plots to usurp the throne. At the same time, this is the reason for his inevitable failure."

At this time, I could only retreat, hoping to recognize Wu Sangui and his decline when "Yang E Biography" is performed.

### Random Notes from the Pear Garden

— Cun Ren

### Author Liu Henwo Passed Away

Mr. Liu Guangzu of Baiyue (pen name Henwo) was good at literature. Before the war, he lived in Shanghai and wrote a lot for various newspapers. The literary giants of Shanghai all traveled with him. Mr. Liu was known for his unrestrainedness, talent, and excellent character, and was respected by scholars. Since the Incident, Mr. Liu was unwilling to remain in seclusion and devoted himself to the country, making a trip to the southwest. For the past five years, he traveled to various provinces, serving in the military, but not forgetting literature. Mainland publications were honored to have a word from him. However, Heaven did not grant him a long life, and he died in a hostel in Dushan, Guizhou on the 29th of October. When the bad news came, all his friends mourned him! It is now heard that Mr. Liu's family in Shanghai plans to hold a memorial service at the Jingtu Temple on Guling Road on the 21st of this month. Since Mr. Liu was sociable and had many friends, it is certain that there will be a grand and mournful event.

The Entertainment World

### It is Not Easy to Please the "Extra"

— Hua Yu

On the stage, holding flags and following the literary and military officials in the play, these are the "extras." Although they do not sing or fight, they seem very easy to do in the eyes of the audience, but in reality, they are not easy. The brilliance of a play may be reduced by the "extra" taking the wrong step, giving the audience a bad impression.

Speaking of the treatment of "extras," it is lower than any other role. Although the job of "extra" is not very important, it is much harder than any other role. When other characters do not need to sing, they can hide backstage to rest, refresh themselves, and rest their voices. Only the "extras" cannot. They still appear on the stage before the play and enter the backstage after the play. Although they stand for a very long time, they still follow the literary and military officials on stage scene after scene, even "changing clothes but not people," holding flags and standing there. No matter how sore their feet are or how tired they are, they cannot be lazy for once. And the treatment they get is so meager. Although the main characters can sing and fight, they will never appear on stage as many times as the "extras," and they will never be as busy as the "extras," but the price they get is always several times, or even more than several times, that of the "extras."

That's how things are in the world. Those who have authority and higher positions can be idle and do nothing, and they get a lot of money. People with smaller positions, their work is so important, their hands and feet don't stop, and they get very little reward. "More work and less pay" is the most disappointing thing. So we often see these "extras" standing on the stage, always listless. This may be because they appear on stage too many times and their bodies are exhausted. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not take the wrong step.

If the treatment of "extras" can be increased a little, although it cannot be as much as the supporting roles, it may be able to balance it with other work. However, it seems that no matter what play, there is always a need for "extras." If there are no "extras," I am afraid it will not be a play.

### Wu Sangui's Character

— Sha Yuan

One of the Characters in "The Biography of Yang E"

"The Biography of Yang E" is Mr. Wei Ruhui's latest work. It is the third play in the Ming Dynasty Regret series, following "Ge Nenniang" and "The Sea Hero Zheng Chenggong."

In the play, in addition to Mr. Wei's consistent strengths - familiarity with historical figures, concise lines, and detailed textual research - we also see that the sculpting of the characters' personalities is deeper and more powerful.

In particular, the author puts some effort into writing Wu Sangui's (played by Shu Shi) personality. We only need to see Wu Sangui constantly scratching his nose (this habit is completely based on textual research), his insidious, cunning, and unpredictable actions. Whether from his actions or his tone, we can see it clearly and be attracted to it.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 19 Dusk, the Tartar Cavalry Raised Dust and Raided the City

Wu Sangui led the major and minor partial commanders and adjutants to welcome them, and also offered cattle, wine, and rewards to the Qing army. Dorgon then ordered Sangui's army to tie white cloth on their shoulders as a sign and act as the vanguard of the Qing army, leading the Qing army to drive straight in. They encountered the roving bandits in the place of Yipianshi. At that time, most of Li Chuang's subordinates had experienced battles and were very valiant. At first, they did not know that the Qing army had entered the pass. They still thought that Wu Sangui's army was coming to fight because Sangui's request for help from the Qing was very secret and had not been publicized in the pass. Li Chuang relied on his large number of soldiers and horses, so how could he put Wu Sangui in his heart? When the two armies were close, they formed formations. Li Zicheng arranged a long snake formation that stretched from the North Mountain to the sea, with flags densely arranged, and the momentum was very majestic. The Qing army was arranged in rows and columns, all ambushing behind Wu Sangui's army. Those of Sangui's subordinates who were at the front were the armies of Ma Bao and Bai Xianzong. Zhang Cangqiu and others were all in the army. The two sides beat the war drums and shook their momentum. Ma Bao stood on his horse under the large flag, with Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei by his side. Ma Bao patted Zhang Cangqiu's shoulder and said, "Today, we are fighting the roving bandits head-on for the first time. If we can win this battle, the roving bandits will inevitably decline after their defeat and will never recover. Moreover, the Qing army is lurking behind us, so we must show some skills in front of them and fight for some face. This relationship is no small matter. Commander Zhang is usually loyal and enthusiastic and always wants to punish thieves for the country. Today, you can kill a few more bandit leaders." Zhang Cangqiu was even more excited after hearing Ma Bao's words. Then he said to Chen Fei, "Let's go to the battle and fight for a while, don't let the Qing army laugh at us for being unattended." (322)

The author talked with Mr. Wei in the rehearsal room about his idea when writing Wu Sangui. He said, "I write Wu Sangui to restore him to his original appearance as a hero, but this hero is a 'individualistic' hero, so he will only plan for himself, wanting to transform from a high-ranking official to a feudal ruler who plots to usurp the throne. At the same time, this is the reason for his inevitable failure."

At this time, I could only retreat, hoping to recognize Wu Sangui and his decline when "Yang E Biography" is performed.
