### Rogers and Others Scheduled to Visit China

Chongqing: The news that Rogers and Fox, American members of the Stabilization Fund Management Committee, are scheduled to visit China has aroused interest from all parties. Although the Chinese government has not recently issued any statements regarding its legal tender policy, well-informed sources unanimously believe that the exchange rate of the legal tender will be maintained. However, there is currently no intention to raise it, so as to avoid disadvantages to exports. As for imports, there are existing purchasing credit loans and barter agreements available, so there is also no need to raise the exchange rate of the legal tender. Of the three Chinese members of the Management Committee, Chen Guangfu is already in Chongqing, and Xi Demao has recently arrived in Chongqing from Hong Kong. Bei Songsun will also come to Chongqing from Hong Kong in the near future. The establishment of the committee is expected to take place in mid-June. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)

### Authorities Closely Monitor Food Situation

Chongqing: The food issue remains under close scrutiny by the authorities. According to Xu Kan, the government has established fundamental and expedient measures. It is reported that Chairman Chiang will report on the food issue at the Central Memorial Week next Monday, at which time the details of the measures will be revealed. Furthermore, today's Central Daily News editorial hopes to implement the land tax in kind and treasury bond plan. This plan was passed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, using treasury bonds to collect surplus grain from landowners, to be repaid with grain upon maturity, with generous interest attached. The original proposal stated that the purpose of this measure was to solve the wartime food supply, strengthen wartime finance, and equalize the wartime financial burden. This may be one of the fundamental measures mentioned by Xu. Furthermore, according to Lu Zuofu's estimation, this year's conversion of land tax to payment in kind in Sichuan province will yield approximately 6.3 million shi of grain. If each landowner purchases an additional 6.3 million shi of treasury bonds in kind, then 12.6 million shi can be obtained, all stored to stabilize the food supply in the rear. In addition, the government should purchase 12.6 million shi with treasury bonds in kind to prepare for emergencies. Lu's intention is that landowners have the surplus capacity to purchase three times the amount of their land tax in kind treasury bonds. (Havas World Telegraph Agency, 23rd)

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation

Chongqing: The Military Affairs Commission issued a statement discussing the war situation on various fronts this week (May 16th to 22nd) as follows:

Since the start of the major battle in the Zhongtiao Mountains of Shanxi and Henan, it has been half a month. The danger and intensity of the battle are unprecedented in the northern theater in the past four years. As of the wood day, the Japanese army's deaths around the Zhongtiao Mountains have reached more than 30,000. The Japanese army participating in this campaign, consisting of seven or eight divisions, all considered excellent, has been greatly weakened by this battle. In order to cover up, the Japanese army has fabricated various rumors, which I have already refuted a few days ago. The world should now be able to see through their trickery.

After being attacked by the Chinese army from all sides last week, the Japanese army in northern Hubei retreated towards Zaoyang city. The Chinese army immediately encircled them. On the night of the 16th, the Chinese army bravely attacked the city and captured Zaoyang. The Japanese then suddenly retreated to the left bank of the Shahe River, where they were again ambushed by the Chinese army in Wucaidian, Xiongjiaji, Suiyangdian, and Ji Mountain, resulting in over 2,700 Japanese deaths. The remaining troops attempted to return to Kanghuan Tan Zhen on the night of the 17th, going east from Xinji in three routes. They are currently being intercepted by the Chinese army.

After the Japanese army on the coast of eastern Zhejiang fled to the warships, suffering heavy losses, they sought revenge. The Japanese army in Zhuji gathered over 10,000 troops and adopted a multi-pronged attack along the railway line, attempting to move south and annihilate the Chinese field army. The Chinese frontline commander immediately adopted a strategy of defeating them individually, fiercely attacking the invading Japanese army. On the evening of the 17th, the Japanese army completely collapsed and retreated north. A certain Chinese unit pursued them and captured Huaxisi and Suxikou on the 18th, Chuandai Shi and Huangdai Shi on the 19th. On the evening of the same day, the Chinese vanguard had already crossed the line of Kui Shi, Wang Sha, and Qi Shi and was pressing on the suburbs of Zhuji city. At 3 p.m., they captured Zhuji city. In this battle, over 4,000 Japanese were killed. The Chinese army is still in pursuit.

The Japanese army, numbering approximately 30,000, that invaded eastern Guangdong started on the 9th, and successively invaded Kailuo and Huiyang from Zengcheng, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Renzhan in multiple directions, attempting to annihilate the Chinese field army. The Chinese knew the Japanese plan and lured the Japanese to the Shanzhou area east of Huiyang, where they launched an encirclement and annihilation battle. By the 16th, they had successively defeated the Japanese army that had advanced to the vicinity of Haoyi Xu. The Chinese took advantage of the victory and pursued them in multiple directions, successively capturing Dadong Xu, Xi Mao Tian, Lianghua Xu, Henggang Xu, Wo Ma Xu, Xiangshui Xu and other strongholds by the morning of the 19th, killing over 3,000 Japanese. At the moment, the Chinese army has already reached the outskirts of Huiyang and Boluo, and the two cities will be captured in a matter of days. In addition, the Japanese who invaded Shidou Jie and Yuanjia Yan south of Pengze and Hukou in northern Jiangxi have been repelled by the Chinese. The Chinese army is still besieging Fuzhou city. Lianjiang was once recaptured by the Chinese. The Japanese army in Sishui, Linze, and Shaman in northern Jiangsu are also being severely annihilated by the Chinese. (Dispatch of the 23rd)

Editorial

### The United States Will Make a Major Decision

President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver his highly anticipated "fireside chat" the day after tomorrow. The day before yesterday, he convened Secretary of State Hull and top military and government officials, such as Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy, to discuss future plans. It is not difficult to guess that it must be related to the speech the day after tomorrow. In recent days, there has been much speculation about the content of the speech. Some say that the President will announce escorting convoys, others say that he will request the amendment of the Neutrality Act, still others say that he will announce a full state of wartime emergency, and yet others say that he will oppose the Axis powers' intrusion into the West Philippines. Regardless of which of the above is correct, there is no doubt that the United States will make a major decision in the coming days.

After suffering setbacks in the Balkans and Libya, Britain was followed by the outbreak of war in the Near East, and the Vichy government declared "Franco-German cooperation." In this situation, with the attitudes of the Soviet Union and Turkey ambiguous, the situation in Crete precarious, and the Near East and the Suez Canal feeling threatened, the British Empire's situation has indeed reached a very serious stage. If any more twists and turns occur in the Atlantic or the western Mediterranean, the British authorities will face an unprecedented dangerous juncture. In this situation, the United States, whose mission is to safeguard the victory of democratic countries, will not only fail to live up to its obligations, but also face the imminent crisis of having to personally deal with the Axis powers' flames extending to the Western Hemisphere.

Looking at the recent movements of the United States, its persistent and active attitude has already been clearly demonstrated. Considering only the actions of the past two or three days, there has been the passage of the "Special Fleet" bill by the House Naval Affairs Committee, as well as the joint resolution of the House and Senate on the confiscation of Axis ships. Secretary of the Navy Knox did not hesitate to firmly advocate yesterday that the United States must be prepared to make sacrifices "worthy of its predecessors," while the War Department requested that the people donate 200,000 pints of blood for emergency use by soldiers and civilians during wartime. All of this is enough to show that the United States is preparing for the worst-case scenario. However, in contrast to the current war situation, these preparations are still insufficient to alleviate "Britain's urgent needs"! Because all bills are either still in the legislative process or have just been passed and are far from being effectively utilized. As for the speeches of cabinet members, they are mostly familiar and do not provide timely help, or they are difficult to turn into immediate action. What Britain needs now is immediate and practical assistance, not verbal encouragement that does not materialize. This is why freedom-loving people around the world are eagerly awaiting President Roosevelt's "chat," because Roosevelt is the head of the United States, whose words carry great weight and who dares to speak and act. Based on past events, each time he speaks, he is able to provide very specific insights. This time, as he is speaking at a time when Britain is feeling desperate, it is believed that he will not disappoint the public and will announce more specific and powerful decisions, at the very least, he will fulfill his promise to "send war equipment to Britain."

At this time, the Axis powers' Far Eastern allies may still be fantasizing about taking advantage of the United States' imminent involvement in the Atlantic to find some exploitable "gaps" to facilitate their selfish ambitions to dominate East Asia. Unfortunately, reviewing yesterday's American cables, on the one hand, Democratic Senator Lee rebuked isolationists for "injecting deadly appeasement poison into the muscles of national defense," and on the other hand, Congressman Weiss advocated banning oil shipments to Japan. Given President Roosevelt's words and actions over the past eight and a half years, there is no reason to believe that he will "change his tune" midway. Therefore, it can be confidently asserted that in his speech the day after tomorrow, he will reaffirm his consistent uncompromising attitude to clear up some of the gray reports that have been circulating in the Far East in the past few days.

Someone said: In this early summer season, it is still a rather meaningful joke to use the phrase "fireside chat."

### Disaster Relief Committee Relief for Refugees in Zhejiang and Fujian

Chongqing: Recently, the Japanese army has harassed Fujian and Zhejiang and bombed rear cities. The government is concerned about the refugees and has implemented relief measures.

Previously, the committee allocated 500,000 yuan for price stabilization in Fujian, and a large amount of food has been purchased in Guangze, Jiangxi and shipped to the province. In Chengdu, Xi'an, Luoyang, Lanzhou, and other places that have been bombed in recent days, the committee has allocated funds to rush relief efforts. It is estimated that 50,000 yuan has been allocated to Chengdu, 100,000 yuan to Luoyang, and special funds have been allocated from the allocated air raid relief reserve funds for Lanzhou and Xi'an to be handled together.

Resources Committee: Memorial Service for Xiao Zhizhi

Chongqing: The Resources Committee held a memorial service on the 23rd for Xiao Zhizhi, the deceased chemical engineer of the committee. Over 200 people attended, including Weng Wenhao and Qian Changzhao. During the meeting, Weng and others gave speeches, praising Xiao's serious scholarship and rigorous work spirit.

### Japanese Ambassador to Great Britain, Shigemitsu, Summoned Back Home, United States to Continue Economic Measures to Prevent Supply of Coal and Oil to Japan

London: Japanese Ambassador to London, Mamoru Shigemitsu, was ordered yesterday to fly back to Tokyo to discuss matters with the government. Shigemitsu had originally planned to meet with Matsuoka en route to Europe, but was unable to meet him due to Matsuoka's hurried return to Tokyo. It is believed here that Shigemitsu may have something to say about the possibility of the United States returning to Japan. When Shigemitsu visited British Undersecretary Butler, he told him that he was about to return to his country and assured him that this trip would not harm Anglo-Japanese relations. Therefore, it cannot be considered a prelude to the severance of relations between the two countries. (Associated Press, 24th)

Tokyo: A government spokesperson today responded to questions regarding the recall of Japanese Ambassador to Great Britain Shigemitsu, saying that the ambassador's plan to return home was only to report to the government. The ambassador had wanted to meet with Matsuoka while he was touring Europe, but this did not happen because the British had reservations about it. The ambassador has been stationed in Britain for more than three years. (Reuters, 24th)

Tokyo: Government and business leaders in Japan are closely watching attempts by American lawmakers to persuade President Roosevelt to continue taking economic measures against Japan. The United States will prevent the supply of coal and oil to Japan. The "Reading News" declared that if this plan is indeed implemented, then US-Japan relations will become tense again. (Haitong, 24th)

Tokyo: The National News declared today that if the United States goes to war with Germany, Japan "should take steps to actually attack the United States."

It also stated that Japan should fully fulfill its mission. (Associated Press, 24th)

### German Artillery Units Land from the Air 克里特恶战进行中 British Hold Positions East of Maleme Heraklion, an Important Port, Reported Recaptured

Cairo – The Maleme airfield is still in German hands. They continued landing troops there yesterday, as well as artillery units, including large field guns and mortars. British forces are currently holding positions east of the Maleme airfield, and fierce fighting is underway. (24th Reuters dispatch)

London – There is no sign of the enemy in the cities and airfields of Crete. Supplies dropped by the Germans are being collected by the British. The situation in Maleme is not very favorable. As far as London knows, the British Navy has scattered an enemy convoy. From a naval perspective, the recapture of Heraklion is extremely important, as it is one of the good ports for landing supplies. (24th Reuters dispatch)

London – Cairo officials announced last night that Allied forces on the island of Crete counterattacked Maleme with some success, but due to the large number of enemy reinforcements transported by air and landed in the area, the Allied counterattack failed to fully develop. The battle situations in Heraklion and Rethymno are satisfactory, and fighting continues. According to the latest news from Crete received in Cairo, the battle situation remains unchanged, and fierce fighting is in progress. The Germans are trying to use their old trick of occupying a point and then holding it firmly. Some German soldiers are carrying automatic weapons and even small mortars, digging trenches and fighting from them, making it difficult for Allied forces to dislodge them. The fighting around the Maleme airfield is fierce, and the Germans are trying to use the airfield to land more troops. However, the Germans have expended a large amount of ammunition in repelling Allied attacks, so it seems doubtful whether they can continue to sustain this firepower for long. British and Greek troops are still holding the coast, repelling enemy landing attempts. The British Middle East Command issued a communiqué last night stating that Crete was again subjected to heavy attacks yesterday (Thursday), which continued throughout the day. The Germans continued to send planes to transport paratroopers and troops to land on the island. The enemy forces gained temporary footholds in Heraklion and Rethymno, but suffered heavy casualties after fierce hand-to-hand combat. The battle situation in both places is now quite satisfactory. The British counterattack in the Maleme area had some success but was subsequently thwarted by enemy reinforcements. Fighting is continuing, and the Germans have suffered many casualties, indicating that the British have achieved military success. British forces in Heraklion are also fighting very bravely. (24th Reuters dispatch)

London – According to the latest news from the island of Crete, Allied forces have driven the Germans out of all key points after fierce hand-to-hand combat, with the exception of Maleme. Allied forces have also controlled the entire coast of the island. German soldiers landing by parachute or transport plane are still restricted. The Germans in Heraklion and Rethymno have been driven out by Allied forces, and the situation in both places has now improved. The Germans in Maleme, a few miles west of Souda Bay, have occupied an area on the airfield, allowing German planes to land, but the airfield is constantly under attack by Allied artillery fire, and fierce fighting is still in progress. German planes are still transporting troops to land in various parts of Crete, but they are all being fiercely attacked by the combined Australian, New Zealand, British, and Greek forces, being either killed or captured. Allied anti-aircraft guns have been very successful in night combat. Last night's communiqué stated that since the Germans began their invasion of Crete, at least sixteen of their transport planes have been shot down, and many large ground transport planes have also been destroyed. A large number of paratroopers have been killed or wounded upon landing. The total number of enemy casualties is now increasing significantly, while Allied casualties are not heavy, and enemy convoys attempting to transport troops to Crete have also been destroyed or heavily damaged, escaping back to their bases. (24th Reuters dispatch)

### Heavy German Casualties in Failed Nighttime Landing Attempt

Alexandria – The British Navy fiercely attacked a German fleet attempting to land troops on Crete under cover of darkness early Thursday morning, inflicting heavy losses on the German ships. The bodies of German soldiers killed and drowned were floating in the sea in unknown numbers. The reporter has just learned the story of this all-night naval battle. At the time, the British fleet inflicted heavy damage on the German ships with relentless fire. Some of the damaged German ships were engulfed in flames, with countless German soldiers screaming for help, while others sank and drowned. British naval officers and the fleet were forced to pass through waters filled with corpses as they proceeded to destroy the last German ship. A captain of a British cruiser told the reporter that this decisive battle could be described as a "massacre," and that "we arrived at the scene of the battle around midnight on Wednesday, expecting the enemy to try to land by sea to reinforce the German troops who had already arrived on the island by air." He also described how they passed a destroyer, whose nationality was difficult to determine, but a searchlight from one of our ships was immediately shone, and the destroyer fired a torpedo at our ship, which missed. It was strange that the enemy's firing seemed very slow. We subsequently identified the ship as Italian, and it was soon destroyed. The ship was escorting a German troop transport and forty Greek fishing boats, carrying a total of four thousand soldiers. After the destroyer was destroyed, these four thousand soldiers also perished at the bottom of the sea. The British cruiser captain also said that after the Italian destroyer was destroyed, our fleet, about several cruisers, under the cover of destroyers, advanced along the north coast. After the destroyed Italian ship, we saw a German transport ship of about one thousand tons, which we bombarded with artillery. The sound of the cannons was deafening, and the German ship suffered the same fate as the Italian ship. After that, it was the turn of the poor small boats, and our artillery fire was very fierce, sinking these boats in rows. He estimated that each of these boats carried about one hundred people, and the transport ship carried two thousand people, so he believed that about six thousand Germans were drowned in this decisive naval battle. (24th United Press dispatch)

Alexandria – A Reuters correspondent with the British Mediterranean Fleet reports that on the night of May 21, the night was pitch black. The enemy, using many sailing ships and small merchant ships, escorted by an Italian destroyer, made the first attempt to land troops on Crete in the dead of night. There were a total of forty sailing ships, each carrying hundreds of soldiers, and several small merchant ships, each carrying hundreds of soldiers. The British fleet was patrolling east of Crete when it spotted the enemy ships and attacked them with four-inch guns and rapid-firing guns. The enemy ships sank one after another, and some caught fire and burned. Thousands of enemy soldiers cried for help in the sea, but because submarines were lurking nearby, the British fleet could not stay long to rescue them. The battle lasted about three hours, after which the British fleet returned safely to its defense and carried an Italian flag picked up from the sea. (24th Reuters dispatch)

### Wooden Man Falls From Sky Nazi Deceptions Abound

London – Another battlefield report states that the Germans have dropped wooden dummies by parachute onto Crete. Although the purpose of this move is not very clear, it may be intended to entice British forces to waste bullets by shooting at the dummies. So far, the Germans have not landed any small airborne tanks, as Front has discovered. The German High Command communiqué still does not mention the invasion of Crete. The communiqué only mentions the fighting in the Eastern Mediterranean, stating that some German air squadrons attacked British warships, sinking or destroying several of them. (24th Reuters dispatch)

### Paratroopers Arrive in Droves Like Locusts Filling the Sky

Although British troops on the island of Crete are harassed by German planes, they are still bravely fighting the German paratroopers, who have suffered heavy losses. However, reinforcements of paratroopers are flying in continuously, jumping down one after another, like locusts filling the sky. They have gained a foothold in more than one place, which is unavoidable. However, the Germans will undoubtedly try again to break through the blockade line in order to transport supplies to the enemy forces arriving from the air. Regarding British reinforcements, it should be noted that when reinforcements land, they will inevitably be subjected to reckless strafing attacks by German planes. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Berlin – The High Command announced today that German Air Force Captain Groete died while leading a squadron of planes in operations against the British. (24th United Press dispatch)

### Fighting Concentrated in Four Key Points British Use Tanks to Control the Enemy

Cairo – A military spokesman here reviewed the battle situation on the island of Crete last night, stating that the overall situation, except for Maleme, is quite good, and fierce fighting is continuing. The two armies are mostly using light and heavy machine guns and mortars in combat, and the Allied forces are also using tanks and hand grenades. There is no sign that the Germans have landed any tanks or motor vehicles. The fighting is concentrated in four key points, namely Heraklion, Rethymno, Chania, and Maleme. Fierce fighting has broken out at the airfield in Maleme, a few miles west of Chania, and the situation is uncertain. The enemy has occupied enough land to land planes, but the airfield is repeatedly attacked by Allied artillery fire, with each side having its own victories and defeats, so it is difficult to predict the outcome of the fighting in Maleme. There is still a possibility that the enemy will be driven out of the airfield. The enemy has no way to land from the sea. The battle situation on Crete is now chaotic, and no German airborne division has landed intact and unscathed. The German tactic is to transport troops to various locations and land them continuously, but the only place they have gained is the Maleme airfield. When asked whether the Allied forces are being hampered by the lack of air support, the spokesman replied that when the Allied forces are subjected to strafing and bombing without seeing their own planes, they inevitably feel the impact of the lack of air support. However, strafing and bombing are not as effective against troops in deep trenches as they are against troops in retreat. (24th Reuters dispatch)

### British Newspapers Review Battle Situation Victory or Defeat Still Difficult to Predict

London – A Times editorial on the battle of Crete states that the enemy is disregarding its heavy losses because it believes that Crete is worth sacrificing to capture. The importance of the island to the defense of Egypt and the freedom of action of the British Navy in the Eastern Mediterranean is self-evident at this time. If the island were to fall, the maintenance of the British Mediterranean Fleet in Alexandria would not be greatly affected, but various operations of the British Navy would be seriously hindered, and the danger to Admiral Cunningham (Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet) would increase. Since the British have been able to prevent enemy artillery and tanks from being transported to Crete, the garrison on the island still has high hopes of overcoming the enemy's superior numbers in this fierce battle.

### London Organizes Free Italian Battalion United World Anti-Fascist Comrades Seek to Restore the Old Glory of the Nation

London – Recently, the Free Italian Committee has been organized in London to unite Italians around the world to oppose Fascism. The committee has drafted a plan to organize a "Free Italian Battalion." Under the leadership of Bettroni, who voluntarily left Italy, the committee has devised a plan to gather Italians in the Americas and other parts of the world to fight against Fascism. Bettroni claims that he has received hints from the Mancini Society in the United States, which uses "Freedom and Honor" as its slogan, that it may cooperate with this movement, and countless Italians around the world have already signed up to participate. Bettroni is from southern Italy and lost an arm due to his participation in organizing farmers' cooperatives and the incidents that followed. After the Munich Agreement was signed in 1938, he left Italy.

### Mr. Bettroni Publishes a Letter

Bettroni, in his capacity as secretary of the Free Italian Committee, wrote a letter to the London Times, explaining the purpose of the group. The letter states, "The powerful blow that Mussolini's empire has taken in Africa makes one consider the possible effects of this victory. When and how will the war situation have repercussions on the internal political structure of the nation? What can replace Fascism? The formation of the Free Italian Committee is motivated by these two questions, and the committee is therefore studying the conditions suitable for organizing a government to succeed Fascism. The purpose of the committee is to unite Italians who oppose dictatorship and sympathize with the Allied countries, regardless of whether they are left-wing or right-wing, and to organize a government managed by the people and for the welfare of all classes of society, to restore the civil liberties of Italy, to restore the national honor of Italy that has been damaged by its aggressive policies, to restore the political and cultural autonomy of Italy that has been sacrificed by its alliance with foreign countries, and to prepare Italy for its new position in the post-Allied victory era. The committee is well aware that the Italian people themselves have many reasons why they cannot break free from the shackles that oppress them, so the committee will do its best to obtain and adjust the assistance that millions of compatriots abroad can give them."

### Greek Minister of the Interior Encourages the People to Fight Valiantly with the British to Win the Final Victory

London – The Greek Minister of the Interior recently issued the following document to the free Greek people: "Our battle against the German army, which began two days ago on this heroic island, is proceeding smoothly. The soldiers of our brave ally, Great Britain, are closely united with the Greek and Cretan soldiers, and are now achieving brilliant victories. Citizens, be encouraged to meet the enemy. We are fighting now, and will continue to fight until we achieve final victory. May God save the free people." (24th Reuters dispatch)

### Berlin Claims Three British Warships Further Sunk by German Air Force

Berlin – German planes yesterday sank two destroyers of the British Mediterranean Fleet, and two more were severely damaged, one of which is burning. Five motor torpedo boats were also sunk. According to German reconnaissance planes, two destroyers are burning after being bombed by German planes. (24th Haitong dispatch)

London – A British Middle East Air Force communiqué states that two enemy dive bombers attempting to attack British ships in the Mediterranean were shot down by British fighters. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Berlin – May 23 will become a "black day" in British history as of four British ships having been sunk off the coast of Crete. That area of the sea is an important route for Britain to reach the Near East and Egypt. Now that it has been controlled by the German Air Force, the passage of British fleets or convoys will require major sacrifices. In addition to sinking four ships this time, six more were severely damaged, including two heavy battleships, which were hit by the largest type of bombs. German planes have a long range, reaching as far as Greenland and the coast of West Africa. British merchant fleets are often sunk in part. German submarines have recently sunk another 110,300 tons of British shipping, including three oil tankers totaling 31,000 tons. The British have lost 91,000 tons of oil tankers this month. In other words, the British lost a total of 127,000 tons of fuel in three weeks this month. (24th Haitong dispatch)

### US Secretary of the Navy Officially Declares Will Fight Again for Freedom Roosevelt and Hull Confer Hope to Revise or Cancel Neutrality Act

Washington – Secretary of the Navy Knox declared yesterday that the United States must prepare to make sacrifices "comparable to those made by our predecessors," and that "it is not easy for us to overcome the current events in the world. We have fought twice before for purpose, so it is important for us to now retake this purpose." At the same time, other government leaders are asking the president to declare a full state of emergency, and the Senate and the War Department are taking further measures to place the United States on a state of emergency footing in terms of politics, military affairs, and industry. Senator Lee, a Democrat from Oklahoma, urged the government to declare a full wartime state of emergency, because, according to him, isolationists have injected a fatal dose of appeasement poison into the muscles of national defense. Lee declared that General Wood of the America First Committee should change the name of his committee to the "Aid Hitler Committee." The Senate unanimously passed a bill authorizing the government to control industry. This would give the president the power to suspend the production of daily necessities in order to accelerate production for the Army and Navy. The bill has been sent to the White House for signature. The Senate also unanimously approved authorizing the Commercial Credit Corporation to collect cotton under government loans in 1940 and earlier, temporarily suspending its commercial trading until after the war. The War Department is asking the people to donate 30 million pints of blood for military and public emergencies during wartime, and has authorized the American Red Cross to handle voluntary blood transfusions. Secretary Knox gave a speech at a meeting of the Naval Construction Society, at which British Ambassador to Washington Lord Halifax was also present. Secretary Knox, facing the British Ambassador, said, "If we do not share in the war against the enslavement of mankind, may God help and forgive us. This decisive war is a struggle for control of the sea. Any country that does not have a combined naval and air force cannot gain a position to dominate the world. We are going to put aside bookkeeping and work for the common good. We are going to donate a part of our property before we are defeated." (24th United Press dispatch)

Washington – House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom stated last night that if government officials indicate a need to amend all or part of the Neutrality Act, the Foreign Affairs Committee is prepared to discuss it immediately. He has planned to hold meetings with Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of State Hull as soon as possible. (24th Reuters dispatch)

New York – The New York Times recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in Washington stating that President Roosevelt and his aides hope that the Senate and House of Representatives will amend or even repeal the current Neutrality Act in order to resolve the British military supply problem. President Roosevelt stopped all work yesterday and only met with Secretary of State Hull, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Stark, and Hopkins, who is responsible for implementing the Lend-Lease Act, to discuss the content of the speech. Recently, the Secretaries of the Navy and War have successively made impassioned speeches criticizing the Neutrality Act, indicating that the authorities have carefully considered this issue. The New York Times also published an article written by isolationist Congressman Fish, which stated, "Knox and Stimson are doing everything they can to draw the American people into the vortex of war. According to the provisions of the Neutrality Act, American ships cannot sail to war zones. The ability of the United States to stay out of the war is due to this." (23rd Havas dispatch)

### US President to Deliver Important Speech the Day After Tomorrow: Expanding the Scope of the Monroe Doctrine, Treating Nazi Submarines as Pirates

Washington: It is widely expected that President Roosevelt will deliver a very important speech on May 27th, addressing fifty million Allied listeners, explaining the serious dangers the United States would face if the Atlantic war were unfavorable to the Allied countries, and the reasons why the United States must defend the entire hemisphere in order to defend itself, thus expanding the Monroe Doctrine to the Eastern Atlantic and to the protruding part of West Africa. He may also announce that Nazi submarines are to be treated as pirates and dealt with accordingly. What the President will say is, of course, currently only known to the President himself and his close aides; this is a highly confidential matter. However, the general public speculates that what the President will say will not deviate from the path recently advocated by Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of Agriculture Wickard. These individuals have all spoken of the imminent national crisis and the necessity of sending US war materials to the British, and their remarks were all first approved by the President. After repeatedly examining the arguments of these individuals, one can get a glimpse of what the President will say on the 27th. The Secretaries of the Navy and War have both recently advocated for the abolition of the Neutrality Act, leading many to believe that the President will also elaborate on the necessity of abolishing this law. However, well-informed sources say that such a grand move is relatively secondary and could provoke endless debates in Congress and delaying actions by isolationists at this critical time. Therefore, it is expected that the President will not seek this option but will take other steps based on his authority as Commander-in-Chief and then seek congressional approval afterward. Some people have recently said that the President does not favor convoys because convoys mean opening fire, and opening fire means opening war. The President has another plan to strike at submarines, and its effectiveness is no less than that of convoys. Could treating submarines as pirates be an explanation of this plan? The possibility of extending the Monroe Doctrine to include the entire Atlantic and to the protruding part of West Africa originated from the opinions of the government's naval and land advisors. They believe that the effective defense of the United States depends on the defense of the entire hemisphere. If a line from British territorial waters through Dakar to the south is not occupied by the United States or friendly countries, South America will be vulnerable to attack from many points. It is expected that the President's speech will present this as the government's view, and this necessary action is now even more necessary because Vichy has apparently offered its territory for German use. Currently, American newspapers do not speculate much about the content of the President's speech, but its importance is widely recognized. What will be delivered on the 27th will likely be an important milestone in American history and foreign policy. The seriousness of the situation is now more clearly understood, and the American people's awareness of the crisis is largely due to Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan's agreement with Germany. In fact, the psychological shock suffered by Americans since the fall of France a year ago has been greater than anything else. Observing the general sentiment, it is felt that any steps decided by the President will definitely receive the support of the majority of Americans. Many now believe that May 27th will be a date to be commemorated in the calendars of all democratic countries for many years to come. (Reuter's dispatch on the 24th)

Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that he would submit a periodic report on the Lend-Lease Act to Congress on June 10th or 11th, at which time he would list the prices of items sent to democratic countries, but he would not disclose the details. The President's response to the possibility of amending the Neutrality Act was evasive, and his statements on the international situation were also cautious. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

German Submarines Appear in US Patrol Zone

London: British naval commentators declared today that Britain's drastic countermeasures have forced German submarines to operate in the more western American neutral patrol zone in the Atlantic in recent weeks. The naval correspondent of the Daily Sketch declared, "There is no reason for excessive optimism, but the Admiralty's efforts to reduce the loss of our ships have made the enemy concerned about the war in the Atlantic and unable to cut off our necessary supplies as they expected." The Daily News reporter Aston said, "The appearance of German submarines in the US patrol zone greatly helps our submarine hunting because although US ships do not attack German submarines, they can notify our ships of the submarines' locations." Other commentators pointed out that German submarines have to make longer voyages to reach their areas of operation, so the danger period for merchant ships is also shorter.

Two Million American Women Support Full Aid to Britain

Atlanta: Delegates of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, representing two million members, supported full aid to Britain. The chairman of the association, Mrs. Hua Ai Deha, said, "Our support this time means that we are willing to do our best in any aid to Britain, such as escorting convoys or sending our youth to Britain to fight." Undersecretary of State Berle said at the meeting of the Women's Clubs, "The United States must take action in this emergency because we have encountered a European country that has ambitions to dominate the world's naval and land power, and now this kind of ambition to dominate is gradually approaching the New World, but we are confident that our strength and skills can be mobilized at any time in any place because this strength is the only way to protect our safety."

### Famous French General Stationed in Syria Joins Free French Forces: Leads Syrian Soldiers Across Border into Transjordan

Cairo: Colonel Collet, one of the famous French generals in Syria, has, along with several other French people, left Syria for Transjordan.

This is the beginning of Franco-German cooperation, through which France can survive and restore its past position in Europe. France can only take care of itself and cannot consider others. The French people have always had great faith in Marshal Petain, and Marshal Petain has complete trust in Deputy Prime Minister Darlan. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

British Newspaper Warns of Vichy's Policy Errors

London: The "Daily Telegraph" commented on Foreign Secretary Eden's warning to Vichy, saying that if Vichy does not change its policies, then there will inevitably be no way to differentiate between occupied and non-occupied areas, and it should be done quickly. The Vichy government may prevent Eden's remarks in the House of Commons on Thursday from reaching the French public, so Britain should find ways to disseminate the Foreign Secretary's warning among the French public. Because not recognizing the Vichy oligarchy as the democratically elected government of France can promote the distinction between the French people and those in France who claim to be in power. The "Daily Mail" said that no matter what happens, it will be the French people who suffer, and British emotions tend to pity rather than hatred. Britain must, in various ways, make this clear to the French people. Anything that can prevent open hostilities between Britain and France should be done by Britain and the United States to the fullest extent. If, unfortunately, this strange change occurs, then the French people must know that the one who is dropping the bombs is Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan. (Reuter's dispatch on the 24th)

In the final match last night (the 23rd), they defeated the West Qing Red team with scores of 15-12 and 15-2. In the second women's group match, Hu Xing played against Min Li.

As a result, Min Li easily won with scores of 15-3 and 15-7, taking the runner-up position. It is noted that the West Qing Women's Group was founded in 1937. Except for the first championship won by Qi Xiu, You Xing has won four consecutive championships, which is truly commendable.

### Grain: Rice from Two Concessions Arrives Steadily, Rice Market Still Not on Normal Track

Yangmi (foreign rice) continued to arrive in Shanghai from the Municipal Council. The Ming Sheng ship of Yichang Foreign Company, loaded with 10,000 bags of yangmi purchased and sold by the Municipal Council from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai at around 1:00 PM yesterday and docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The Xia Fei mail ship of French company, loaded with 3,600 tons of yangmi from Saigon, is expected to arrive today. (Zu)

Yesterday, yangmi market initially fell then rose, fluctuating by two or three yuan throughout the day. However, the final closing price was only slightly higher than the previous night, with a slight increase of a few cents to about one yuan. The rice market is hesitant to rise or fall before the festival, and may need to go through a period of fluctuation before returning to normal, with normal ups and downs. The opening price in the morning was weak due to the weakness of the previous night, and selling sentiment was strong. Both spot and futures rice prices fell by a small two or three yuan. Subsequently, because inland merchants, Japanese merchants, and villagers in the street were all taking advantage of the low prices to buy, the market suddenly became prosperous. The selling prices of yangmi at various stalls immediately rebounded gradually. The situation in the afternoon was still tight, but there was no significant increase or decrease. Yinghua Company No. 1 Saigon was at a low of 139 yuan, a mid-range of 140 yuan, and a high of 141 yuan. Small bran was at 132-133 yuan, broken rice was at a low of 100 yuan, and a high of 102-103 yuan. Spot rice small bran that can be re-exported rose from 108.5 yuan to 111-112 yuan. Municipal Council small bran ranged from 101 yuan to 103 yuan, and Saigon No. 1 ranged from 115 yuan to 118 yuan. The total transaction volume for spot rice was 20,000 bags, and more than 1,000 tons for Yinghua Company.

Owners of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice still held onto their goods due to scarcity. Local shops and villagers were generally normal, but wholesale buyers found the market more active. Therefore, the prices were not much changed between the fluctuations in yangmi. Wuxi fresh japonica was still 134 yuan, Kunshan fresh japonica was 132 yuan, Zhongguan was at 127-128 yuan, Nangang early and late rice fresh special was 132 yuan, ordinary fresh was 130 yuan, secondary to old was 125 yuan, original package fresh was 135 yuan, ordinary was 132 yuan, 130 yuan.

After a batch of domestic glutinous rice was sold at a low price in the previous dynasty, the impact made it difficult to sell high-quality goods. The outlets for food stalls and cake shops were also sluggish, resulting in owners being willing to sell at a looser price. As a result, the price fell by one or two yuan. Hong Kong special round grain opened at 112 yuan, ordinary at 110 yuan, 108-109 yuan, glutinous tea special issue at 100 yuan, 99 yuan, Zhongguan at 95-96 yuan, domestic glutinous rice unopened.

Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Bean Transactions Sharply Reduced

Yesterday, the noise in the miscellaneous grains and oil cake market was reduced by half, because the actual sales of various items were flat. Speculative football trading became more restrained as the Dragon Boat Festival approached. Therefore, the overall trend was still fluctuating. Various prices only rose or fell by two or three cents. The total transaction volume was 65 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 178 yuan original plate, 230 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at 118 yuan, 700 cans of Yanshi canned raw oil at 155.5 yuan, and more than 2,000 bags of Guide soybeans at 45.5 yuan, followed by 44.8 yuan. Other corn opened at 2,000 bags, and Qingdou cake at 1,000 pieces, Shenji futures cake at 20,000 pieces.

The willingness of foreign banks to supply was better than the previous day, and the US dollar could be settled at 5.4375 yuan at one point. Some Hua merchant speculators sold off, but Jinzi Gang and Hua Bank both absorbed, so it soon returned to equilibrium. In the end, both the British exchange and the US exchange were the same as the closing price of the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and the half-day trading was not deserted.

However, a certain British bank supplied settlements at the above price soon after, and a return to the level was seen, and HSBC's hanging spleen exchanges were all flat, with the silver balance tax being half lower. Calculated to charge 23.75%, the speculators rushed to block out the May and June American dollars five units four three seven five, but the gold sets came in at the same price, and Hua Bank also had an absorbing appetite, so the looseness was not easy to unfold, the closing spot to the June term were all British exchanges three office staff three one two five, and the American dollars were five yuan four zero six two five, which were both the same as the closing price of the previous day.

### Reasons for the Decline in Exchange Remittance Surcharge

The surcharge for exchange remittance in this city has recently fallen to about one yuan per thousand yuan, which is very different from the previous surcharge of more than two hundred yuan per thousand yuan. The reason for the decline is that there are more funds flowing into Shanghai from foreign ports, especially from Tianjin. Due to the favorable exchange rates, the amount remitted has reached tens of millions of yuan. In addition, the foreign exchange in this city has been lengthened, and many people who previously purchased and stored foreign exchange and foreign currencies have sold them and converted them into legal tender. Part of the Chinese merchant banks, because the bank joint reserve committee, in addition to reducing interest rates for drawing account customers, also stipulates quotas, and interest is not calculated for amounts exceeding the quota. At the same time, foreign merchant banks notified Chinese merchant banks to reduce the amount, and it was also heard that a certain foreign merchant bank not only did not pay interest on deposits from Chinese merchant banks, but also charged handling fees if they exceeded the prescribed deposit amount. Therefore, the use of drawing accounts has been reduced, and part of the Chinese merchant banks are not willing to accept large drawing account deposits to avoid interest costs. As for exchange remittance deposits, interest is calculated monthly according to the market rate and there is no limit, and exchange remittance has collateral, which is stable and reliable, so many people convert legal tender into exchange remittance so that they do not lose interest. From this point of view, legal tender and exchange remittance can be exchanged at par, and it is possible that exchange remittance will increase in the future, which is also a constant thing in life.

### Coal: Factory Worries About Coal Briquette Price Drop - Buy When Cheap -

Coal briquette prices, because of the drop of white coal, the hoarders were afraid of affecting the coal factory, so they hurried to get rid of the old stocks. The Chinese LIZHONG coal company once asked for 170 yuan, but because the factories absorbed the cheap coal, the market was shaken up. But the big factory lacked stocks extremely. But could withstand 296 yuan price. If there will be more source and lower water fee, it may be cheaper.

### Bank (3)

As for why the Ministry of Revenue did not handle the banking business itself at that time, but had to have Sheng Xuanhuai do it, it can also be seen in this memorial. It said:

"As for banks, they are modeled after the West, and they are the hub for benefiting commerce and industry, not just for taking interest, and certainly not just for creating a granary. The atmosphere in China has not yet opened up, and the ticket offices and money shops in the capital are all funded by merchants themselves, and have not received official support, so their strength is very weak; and HSBC, the Russo-Chinese Bank, and other banks have successively set up in the capital, and have been able to monopolize our great profits. If an official bank is opened first in the area where all directions converge, as an initiative for the provinces, it can connect the arteries of Chinese merchants internally, and prevent the coercion of foreign merchants externally, and the benefits will certainly not be small. However, official shares are not easy to raise, commercial shares are not easy to attract, and there is even more fear that the manager will not be the right person, and the disadvantages will be seen before the benefits are realized. This is another difficulty in establishing a bank."

When the China Commercial Bank was established, its credibility was not yet established, and the banknotes it issued were not valued by the world, and could not circulate freely. Therefore, on the one hand, foreigners were hired as managers in order to connect with foreign banks, and they also joined the Foreign Merchants' Banking Association. On the other hand, money shop owners with considerable status were hired as managers. At that time, it was still the era when the money industry dominated, but because it was affected by the influx of foreign goods, causing silver to flow out, people gave it to foreign merchant banks; and they were able to use it to manipulate our finances and oppress Chinese merchants. However, when it came to the export season, Chinese merchants' funds were ample, and foreign banks sometimes relied on the Chinese merchants. Moreover, the remittance drafts of money shops were of unlimited nature, and foreign banks accepted a money shop ticket without suspicion; while Chinese banks were mostly of a limited nature. When they first opened, foreign banks did not trust them as much as they trusted the notes of the money industry. As long as the money industry was willing to collect and deliver banknotes issued by the bank, they could circulate in the market. Not only was this the case in the late Qing Dynasty, but even before the tenth year of the Republic of China, whenever a bank was opened, it was necessary to recruit one or two veterans from the money industry to manage the business. Therefore, Sheng Xuanhuai immediately invited Xie Lunhui, a director of the money industry, to serve as manager. Xie then said to Sheng, "Today's China Commercial Bank is already a sham in terms of capital, but real in terms of profits. From now on, only by not touching any more bank funds can we take over." Sheng nodded in agreement. The so-called sham capital but real profits means that the capital has already been used, but the profits must be paid in real terms.

Someone asked Xie about the method of running a bank, and Xie answered with one sentence, saying "The forehead of a dead person." It means that in handling bank affairs, there must be no carelessness, and one must follow the rules and regulations, and do it as rigidly as the hard bandages on the forehead of a dead person. When asked how a bank could be run well, Xie said, "Foreign money is always in front of your eyes." The meaning of the bold words, although not as extreme as the slang saying "turning somersaults in the eyes of copper coins," the important business of a bank is to absorb deposits and develop loans, only recognizing foreign money and not recognizing people, it is certainly necessary to see the inflow and outflow of foreign money clearly.

The banknotes issued by the China Commercial Bank included both silver dollar notes and silver tael notes. The silver tael notes were issued exclusively by the China Commercial Bank, so even though the Ministry requested to mint and issue one tael silver dollars, it had already issued silver tael notes. Since Xie entered the China Commercial Bank, the credibility of the banknotes began to be solid, and they circulated in the market in the same way as foreign bank notes.

The opening of the Russo-Chinese Bank was very imposing. At that time, HSBC Bank was implicitly the leader of the financial world in Shanghai, and the Russo-Chinese Bank thought of surpassing it. Not only did it compete with it in business, but it also sought to surpass it in architecture, so it specially built a stone building to show off. Shanghai's first "stone house" started with the Russo-Chinese Bank, which is now the address of the Central Bank. Not only that, but it also opened up a wide square next to it for staff members to play ball in their spare time. Half of it still exists today, which shows the richness and thoughtfulness of its facilities. At this time, HSBC Bank did not yet have the towering mansion that stands tall on the Bund today.

It was rumored in Shanghai that when the Russo-Chinese Bank was first established, the Empress Dowager Cixi had invested five million taels in it, but the matter was confidential and could not be known in detail. However, after the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War, China repeatedly encountered foreign humiliation and suffered repeated defeats. The Russians took advantage of the opportunity to outwardly show goodwill to the Qing government, helping it to recover the Liaodong leased territory, but secretly preparing for future leases, and becoming the fuse for the Russo-Japanese War. The Qing court also thought of relying on Russian foreign aid to resist Japan, only thinking of venting anger, and not considering the future consequences. Moreover, in view of Japan's occupation of Liaodong, with others sleeping soundly beside the bed, the Qing court feared that unexpected disasters would arise and that things would happen in a hurry. The Russo-Chinese Bank happened to be established at this time, implicitly entrusting it to the Russians. In fact, it is impossible to clearly distinguish whether it existed or not, but in terms of reason, it is not without cause. What's more, there were officials and nobles who, in order to comply with the Qing court's orders, secretly deposited huge sums of private wealth in foreign banks, in order to avoid the trouble of investigation and confiscation, which almost became a trend. For example, in the first month of the 24th year of Guangxu, Huang Siyong said that because various countries were competing to borrow funds, it would be better to raise domestic debt, and also mentioned that Chinese people would rather deposit funds with foreign merchants and gamble on their securities, saying:

"In the treaty ports, Chinese people rely on foreigners to buy tickets (referring to bonds and stocks) and borrow money. They cannot use it themselves, so they invest in others. Today, there are countless private funds of gentry deposited in foreign banks under the name of foreign merchants for operation."

The words "gentry" here still did not dare to openly criticize as princes, dukes and high-ranking officials! Therefore, it is said again:

"The common people are not to be blamed. Please strictly order Chinese and foreign officials to inspire them with loyalty and righteousness, and first send officials to be advocates for the people."

This clearly states that officials deposited private wealth in foreign merchant banks. There is also one of the most obvious examples. At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, Prince Qing Yikuang transferred his private funds from the banks of the two warring countries to HSBC Bank. Jiang Shili memorialized and impeached him, saying:

"Firstly, on the 12th day of the 11th month of the 19th year of Guangxu (1903 in the Western calendar), Prince Yikuang, upon hearing the news of the Russo-Japanese War, withdrew 1.2 million of his private assets from the Russo-Chinese Bank and the Yokohama Specie Bank and deposited them in HSBC Bank in Dongjiaomin Lane. The bank knew his intention and made things difficult in every possible way before agreeing to accept the deposit, paying only a 1% monthly interest." (To be continued)

### Weak Sales in Cotton Yarn Port • Revolving Yarn Market

The yarn market has stabilized, but the trend is still softening, because the actual position has not seen a large amount of progress. However, the Hong Kong merchants have a slightly better appetite for 20-count yarn, buying 250 bales of Two Golden Chickens and Da Fa, and 50 bales of Shepherd, and 120 bales of 10-count yarn, totaling 420 bales. Therefore, the bulls are active again, but some say that the inventory is still thick. In addition, a certain standard yarn is very low, and the ratio to Double Horse is too far apart, creating heavy pressure. There is also a saying that foreign customers have already turned from short to long in small amounts. Therefore, it revolves strongly between 420 and 430 yuan. The high price of 20-count Double Horse is 1,432 yuan, and the low price is 1,421 yuan. The range of rise and fall is narrow. After noon, most people are resting because it is the weekend. It is said that 200 to 300 bales were traded, and the price was 1,422 to 1,423 yuan. Today, 1,255 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning. Because the market sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day had turned high, the situation continued to tighten. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,430 yuan. As soon as this price opened, one side on the table raised the price and sold it. After a while, it rose slightly to 1,432 yuan. After that, the buying momentum slowed down, and the market suddenly loosened to 1,425 to 1,426 yuan. However, hat-snatching friends suddenly came to cover short positions, and it returned to 1,428 yuan. Then, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had stabilized and the premium had not changed much. The market looked downward and fell to 1,421 yuan. Forced to the close, it returned to 1,425 yuan. It is found that the total transaction volume for half a day was 9,420 bales. The amount bought by each trade is listed below:

Hong Kong 420 Others 9,000 Total 9,420

Everyone is bullish on fine velvet

The current cotton situation is stable, and the industry is relatively active, mostly doing calculations, because foreign cotton is rising. However, manufacturers, in view of the pessimistic yarn sales and the difficulty of pushing out inventories, do not handle high-priced raw materials. However, 42-count raw materials are stimulated by foreign cotton and are becoming tighter, and there is also a sales route to a certain country overseas.

American Pengjiapo No. 309, 100 pieces, handed over to the warehouse

Another message says that the foreign cotton transaction of foreign firms in Shanghai is flat, and there are few transactions. However, because the foundation of raw cotton is solid, and at the same time, the purchase and transportation from overseas feel difficult, everyone is still unanimously bullish.

The New York cotton market first fell due to speculators selling, but then rose again due to public buying and Washington political news that the president would agree to the 85% loan case. As a result, the closing price rose by 18 to 19 points compared to the 10th.

Another telegram says that the American cotton statistics from August 1st of last year to May 23rd of this year are recorded below (500 pounds per bale):

The Indian cotton market has been temporarily suspended due to riots. As for the forecast for today's opening market, it is expected to be up by half a rupee due to the firm American cotton.

Securities • Domestic Debt Slightly Firm

The gray market of public bonds was slightly firmer yesterday, because there were slight official transactions, and people's minds were stabilized. Although sellers poured in, buyers bought it themselves and were not shaken by it, knowing that most of the sellers were floating households who were sensitive, and were not important to the market. Therefore, the accounts of both buyers and sellers in the market are worth paying attention to. Yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was done in the morning. Yu Yu No. 7 bought a lot of both Ding and Bing, and it was noticed for a while. Xie Kang was alert and followed the trend. Hongda Yitai sold it. Because the buyers were relatively strong, the result was slightly better by one or two dimes. Transactions amounted to 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock transaction, 100 shares of the Bank of China were traded, and the price was 92 yuan and 75 cents.

London, 23rd (Zhou Jiang) telegram, today's listed market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are both flat, and the market has not changed.

Piece Goods • Rayon Napped Fabrics • Resumed Dumping

Rayon napped fabrics once came to Shanghai five or six years ago, but because they were not durable, and extremely lacking in cold resistance, easy to break when wet, easy to wrinkle and tear when rubbed, everyone said they were fooled. The reputation of stores that sold them was damaged day by day, and no one asked about them one after another. Therefore, the time of sale was very short. Unexpectedly, in the current rising price of napped fabrics, this kind of inferior rayon napped fabrics has been shipped to Shanghai for dumping. Because the military department is making them, and most of them have not paid customs duties, the selling price is cheap. Many in the industry are greedy for the price, and there are many who are deceived. The cheapest one is two or three yuan, and the highest sells for 30 yuan. The ordinary price starts from 20 yuan to 25 or 26 yuan. Most ordinary shops hang a sign of five or six yuan to even seven or eight yuan per foot. Those who are sharp-eyed and experienced will be able to distinguish it with a little attention. By the way, rayon napped fabrics are mostly dyed with a shiny finish. Burn it with a match, and the real and fake will be distinguished immediately.

Sugar Market • Coarse White Continues to Loosen

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken, because powerful figures in the industry were still selling, and people inevitably felt a downturn.

The lower grade is firm, DY Mark West Warehouse Provincial Package 99 yuan, 7 cents, and sack packing 99 yuan.

Seafood • Laver Seaweed Prices are High

Recently, such as small square East laver seaweed, it opened at 635 yuan, to 640 yuan, and 671 yuan. New goods have not arrived. According to news from the producing area, the declared cost must be 700 yuan, which shows that the market will have to rise again.

### French Municipal Council Prepares to Sell Rice • Organizes Import Committee • Designates Three Foreign Firms to Jointly Handle • Requests from Areas Outside the Settlement to Receive Hong Kong Rice Not Approved

The Saigon rice ordered directly from the Vietnamese government by the French Municipal Council, the first batch of 50,000 bags, will arrive in Shanghai this month. At the same time, the French Municipal Council has designated three companies, Dahu Foreign Firm at No. 181 Jiangxi Road, Fojia Foreign Firm at No. 34 Aiduya Road, and Shenji Foreign Firm at No. 2 Beijing Road, to jointly organize an import committee to handle the distribution and sale of this Saigon rice. Dahu and other three foreign firms are currently planning, but the method is said to be very different from the Shanghai Municipal Council's promotion of affordable Hong Kong rice. The specific plan will be announced after the Saigon rice arrives in Shanghai. At the same time, Saigon will also organize an export committee to handle export procedures.

Summoning Firms • Discussing Sales

The person in charge of handling this Saigon rice for the French Municipal Council is Sarey, the Minister of the Political Department. Last week, he summoned more than ten grain firms in this city, such as Ruichangfa, to discuss undertaking the sale of Saigon rice. The Municipal Council agreed to give the sales firms an 8% handling fee. The grain firms felt that the profit was too small and have not yet reached an agreement. One said that the profit has been agreed to be 5%.

Three Batches of Hong Kong Rice • Will Arrive Today

The Shanghai Municipal Council's third batch of 20,000 bags of foreign rice shipped to Shanghai, transported by Taikoo Company's Nanjing and Suzhou No. 2 ships, could have arrived yesterday. However, the company suddenly received telegrams from the two ships saying that due to weather conditions, they would have to be delayed until today to arrive in Shanghai. Also, the company's Hanyang ship will also carry 10,000 bags of foreign rice for the Municipal Council to arrive in Shanghai today. According to reporters' inquiries to the French Shipping Company yesterday, the company's Xiafei ship will arrive at this city from Saigon at 2:30 pm today, carrying 30,000 bags of Saigon rice, which were ordered by local grain firms. The ship will berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Pudong to unload the goods.

Hongkou and Western Shanghai • Allowed to Sell

The Times reported that the foreign rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council from Hong Kong is a great benefit to the general public. It is learned that the Municipal Council authorities yesterday (the 23rd) also allowed rice shops in the Hongkou and Western Shanghai areas to sell the Municipal Council's Hong Kong rice. However, rice shops in the Nanshi area cannot enjoy this benefit, for fear that some unscrupulous rice merchants may transfer the Municipal Council's rice to other places to make a profit. According to the Jianghai Customs report, the foreign rice imported to Shanghai in April totaled 109,060 tons, worth 21,555,000 yuan. Although the import volume of foreign rice this month has not been announced, it is expected to be more than in April.

Nanshi and Other Places • Temporarily Not Issued

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council allowed rice merchants in the areas beyond the settlement roads to resell the Municipal Council's foreign rice, they have rushed to order from Lijiyang Bank and the 17 grain firms designated by the authorities. Yesterday, several companies had paid and picked up the goods at Xiangmao Foreign Firm. However, most rice shops purchased from grain firms for business convenience. According to reporters' inquiries, rice merchants in Nanshi, Zhabei and Datang and other places sent people to Xiangmao Foreign Firm at 2 pm the day before yesterday to request permission to purchase the Municipal Council's foreign rice for sale in the stores, but the authorities, for some reason, indicated that "it is not allowed for the time being."

Rice Shop Employees • Requesting Salary Increase

The employees and workers of rice shops throughout the city have also been affected by the high cost of rice and their lives are difficult, with income not meeting expenses. Therefore, they jointly submitted a request for a salary increase to the shop owners yesterday, and set a deadline of three days for a satisfactory response. Excerpts from the salary increase conditions are as follows: the salary increase will be 70% of the new amount of 4 yuan, 8 yuan, 12 yuan, 16 yuan, and 20 yuan according to the employee level in 1937. The rice allowance is based on 50 yuan (No. 2 Saigon). For those exceeding 50 yuan, an additional 5 yuan will be given for every 10 yuan, rounded to the nearest whole number. The settlement will be based on the rice price increase or decrease at the end of the month. Workers will receive a flat increase of 10 yuan to their current salary. Regardless of the distance, the handling fee will be 25 cents per picul, totaling 20 items.

Those Driving by Horn are Bad Drivers

Yesterday was the sixth day of the anti-noise campaign, and there has been a reduction in those who indiscriminately honk their horns on the road. However, there are still many drivers who, even after having their horns modified at the car shop to reduce the noise, still honk them two or three times. It is hoped that this will be corrected immediately. In short, a good driver can drive without worry even if the car is temporarily not equipped with a horn. Those who want to show off and drive fast must honk continuously. However, in the event of an accident, whether the car owner or the hired driver, both will inevitably be subject to imprisonment. Therefore, the police's launch of the anti-noise campaign contains deep meaning. It is hoped that the public will not drive fast, so as not to cause trouble.

Western Newspaper Reporter Assaulted • Sues in Italian Court

Leonoff, the local editor of the Continental News, was verbally insulted and assaulted by an Italian in Western Shanghai the night before last (the 23rd). It is heard that he has filed a criminal lawsuit in the Italian Consulate Court yesterday. It has been found out that one of the four Italians who committed the assault was Saston Tinni, a prominent figure among the Fascists here. Saston telephoned Leonoff that afternoon and asked to meet him at the Royal Hotel at 4 pm. When Li arrived as scheduled, he was assaulted by three Italians who were waiting there. One of them was named Peignuki, and another was named Lamoyuan, who lived on Albert Road and opened a clothing store. The other one was a sports teacher. According to reports, that evening, the Italians first asked Mr. Li to meet at the Royal Hotel, but later, on the pretext that the location of the hotel was inconvenient, they changed the location to the Huizhong Hotel. Later, they tricked Mr. Li into chatting at the Italian Association, and then, on an empty lot, four Italians forced Mr. Li to drink a bottle of castor oil. Mr. Li refused, and as a result, a conflict broke out. Mr. Li was severely injured due to being outnumbered.

US Asian Fleet officers and soldiers whose service term in the East had expired also returned home on the ship. It is found that in the past, US Navy transport ships would stay here for about ten days, but at the beginning of this year, the transport ship Jiameng only stayed briefly before leaving.

### Italian Ship Detained in Dinghai • Goods All Lost • Detained for Over Five Months and Released a Few Days Ago

The English Great American Evening News says that it has recently learned that the Italian merchant ship Amalia was detained by the Japanese Navy in Dinghai, Zhoushan Islands, for over five months. It has now been released and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, but all the goods on board have been lost. The ship's Shanghai manager, Stanner Mattilettos, told reporters that the ship was registered in Italy and flew the Italian flag. The goods on board were entrusted by Chinese people to be delivered to American, British and Italian merchants and have been seized by the Japanese. He has therefore protested to the Italian Consulate and is waiting for the Italian Consulate authorities to take action. However, according to an Italian Consulate official's reply to reporters, Italian officials are unlikely to take any action in this matter.

Negotiating for the Return of American Merchants' Goods

It is also heard that the goods delivered to American merchants that were seized by the Japanese were mostly Wenzhou lace and embroidery. The US Consul General in Shanghai has therefore negotiated with the Japanese authorities, requesting an investigation so that the goods can be returned to their original owners. The US Consul is currently awaiting a reply from the Japanese.

### Detained for Half a Year • Recently Released

It is found that the Amalia traveled between Wenzhou and Shanghai. At the beginning of December of last year, it was detained by a Japanese warship in Dinghai, a small port in the Zhoushan Islands. Chinese passengers on board the ship were allowed to disembark, but the ship was detained. It was only released a few days ago, and all the goods on board were lost. It is heard that when the Japanese confiscated the goods, they forced the captain to sign a statement stating that the goods were all owned by Chinese merchants. The captain had no choice but to sign it reluctantly under protest, and the ship was released.

### Medical Association Assists • Epidemic Prevention Campaign • Notifies All Shanghai Physicians to Mobilize • Voluntarily Vaccinate Citizens

The Shanghai Medical Association held its 11th session, 24th executive committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Zhu Yanggao passed four reports and discussed two proposals. The first item was a proposal by Committee Member Song Guobin to launch an epidemic prevention campaign, which was approved. It was decided to assist the health authorities in holding an epidemic prevention campaign from June 1st for half a month. The method is to notify all member physicians to sacrifice one or two hours each day to vaccinate citizens for epidemic prevention, free of charge or for a small fee. Before vaccination, they should first examine those who are not suitable for vaccination and then issue a certificate of non-vaccination. Certificates will only be issued after the third vaccination, but they must adhere to the creed and never bend to personal feelings. They will also consult with Xinya, Xinyi, and Daxi three pharmaceutical factories to provide vaccines free of charge. After this is implemented, it will truly benefit society and also supplement what the health authorities cannot do.

Over a thousand people from Chinese and foreign circles attended. Order at the venue was maintained by French Boy Scouts.

Tomorrow evening (26th) at 6:00 PM, Dr. Loyt will give a lecture entitled "The French Academy and Medicine" (in French), followed by a French sound film. In his opening address, the French Consul General praised Chinese medicine and the students of Aurora University.

French Consul General Praises Chinese Medicine

The French Consul General stated briefly that, a few months ago, when he visited Aurora University, he was very impressed to see Chinese students very proficient in surgery, physiology, and anatomy. In his personal opinion, Chinese students are rich in the innate talent for diagnosis, and they can inherit and promote China's inherent medicine. In this era of modern medicine, Chinese medicine cannot be ignored. China is a country with the most extensive medical knowledge. Chinese scholars have studied the importance of the pulse and have made detailed deductions, especially making the greatest contribution to the diagnosis and treatment of typhoid fever. Today, the world is accustomed to the method of vaccination, but the Chinese have invented a specialty for the diagnosis and treatment of smallpox centuries ago. He sincerely wished that this exhibition would arouse the attention of Chinese doctors and medical students, and that one day they would also report on the success of their work, so that China and France could communicate and mutually improve their medical knowledge.

The hundreds of laid-off employees were extremely panicked. Yesterday (24th) at around 10:00 AM, led by the representatives, more than two hundred laid-off male and female employees went to the Gorden Road factory, and managed to open the doors of the printing department. The employees then began a hunger strike, without damaging any machinery or objects, and the order was very good. According to the person in charge, the hunger strike in the factory was due to the fact that there was no other way to think of. Rather than being laid off and starving to death on the streets, it would be better to starve to death directly in the company. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, representatives from the Circulation Department came to offer condolences, and left after talking for about an hour. At around 6:00 PM, police cars drove up, full of armed detectives, who forcibly evicted the laid-off employees from the factory and arrested representatives Gu, Tian, Pan, and Chen.

Last month, the price of rice was manipulated and raised by rice merchants, and once rose to more than 150 yuan. The labor side believed that it had the right to demand an increase in wages, while the capitalist side believed that the price of rice had soon fallen, and the demand should be cancelled.

### Ticket Scalping at Grand Theatre; Two Defendants Released on Bail for Further Verification

In the Grand Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road, there was a strike of ticket collectors and ticket sellers last month. It is now known that the strike was actually caused by the ticket sellers and ticket collectors colluding to commit fraud, which was discovered by the authorities. On April 15 this year, a ticket collector, Wang Runsheng from Jiading, collected the tickets when collecting tickets, but did not tear them, hoping to give them to the ticket office to resell. He was discovered by the manager, a Westerner named Irif, who questioned him strictly. Only then did he learn that there were more than a dozen people colluding to commit fraud, from December last year to the present, which has lasted for several months. He ordered all ticket collectors and ticket sellers to be suspended, which caused the strike. Zhang Kunfeng, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, and detective Xu Shutian arrested the ticket collector Wang Runsheng and the ticket seller Chen Jingbo. This morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, requesting a postponement, and also based on the complaint from the Westerner manager of the Grand Theatre. When the two defendants were questioned, they admitted to the fraud, and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to request bail. The court ordered the two defendants to each pay 500 yuan bail to be released, and rescheduled for seven days for further verification.

Afterwards, they were discovered by someone, but it was too late. They immediately called an ambulance to the scene and transported the three bodies to the Shanghai Sanatorium on Bazilu. It is reported that the three girls are all around eight or nine years old.

### Self-Reflection

— Xiao Ning

"Self-reflection," "introspection," children, perhaps you are tired of hearing this term? But how many of you have truly done it? I think there must be very few!

"Why do we need to self-reflect?" Many children must be confused. The answer to this question can be divided into the following points:

1. Do you admit that the only person in the world who can truly know you (that is, "know everything you do and think") is yourself! Of course, everything about you should be deeply pondered and borne by you. As for the guidance of others, it is only of a helping nature!

2. Self-reflection can develop your reason. In other words, through constant reflection, your reasoning power will become stronger, because your ability to distinguish between right and wrong is improved in an intangible way!

3. Self-reflection can cultivate your good habit of being cautious and meticulous!

4. Self-reflection can cultivate your character and promote your progress!

No one in the world dares to say that they have no shortcomings. Precisely because of this, "self-reflection" is his best remedy. Therefore, children, when a day has passed, you should reflect calmly: Have you done anything bad today? Have you said anything bad? Have you wasted time? Have you owed anything in your homework...? If you find mistakes, then eliminate them immediately! Correct them! In this way, your progress must be accelerated!

Look! In history! How many great figures are there who do not have a great spirit of self-reflection? Yes, children, if you want to be a great man, you should also carry forward the spirit of self-reflection and strive to examine yourselves!

### Why Aren't Aimei's Grades Good?

— Wan

Kexiong and Aimei are siblings who are both studying at Qinzhi Elementary School. Kexiong is one year older than Aimei, so he is in a higher grade. On weekdays after school, Kexiong always jumps and plays around and refuses to review his homework until 7:00. But Aimei is not like that. She takes a book home and reads it from time to time. However, she is not very focused. When her mother is talking to a neighbor, she wants to listen to what they are saying. When she hears that someone's child is crying, she wants to go out and see what happened. She is always walking around with the book. So when there is a lot of homework on that day, she cries anxiously at night.

The days pass quickly. The second quiz is approaching. The teachers at Qinzhi Elementary School have also begun to prepare for the exam. Therefore, the lazy students have to open up the unfamiliar books to prepare for this important moment. At this time, Aimei's study time is particularly long, while Kexiong is still playing freely besides reviewing his homework an hour earlier. To others, Aimei seems to be more diligent than Kexiong.

When the two report cards arrived in his father's hands, he couldn't help but feel strange. Why did Aimei barely pass arithmetic, while Kexiong's grades were excellent? After much thought, he knew that Aimei's study method must be inappropriate. So he called her in front of him and asked, "How did you prepare for the exam?" She replied, "Father, I prepared very well before the exam. I read it several times from beginning to end until I could memorize it, but I don't know why I forgot everything when I took the exam? Like this time when I took arithmetic, many of the questions were not in the book. I can do all the projects I have done in the book." Father asked, "Do you understand everything?" She said, "There are many things I don't understand, but I remember them very well!" Father instructed her, "Your method of rote memorization is not right! No wonder you have no time to play. You must know that if you want to have good grades in the future, you have to change your attitude towards studying. First, you must concentrate when studying, and you must not have any distracting thoughts in your mind, nor can you look around. Only by focusing on the big book can you gain insights. Second, you must thoroughly understand; no matter what subject, if you have any doubts, stop until you ask and understand. At that time, you have gained real knowledge, and it is not easy to forget. Third, you must distinguish the key points in the book and underline them with a pen, so that you don't have to memorize the words in the book, so as not to waste time. Fourth, organize the important points you have underlined, such as an event in history, analyze the cause, process, and result clearly, so that it is more convenient and easier to remember. Then, after we know the contents of the book, we close the book and recall it in our minds. Review the parts that are unclear or unfamiliar. If you prepare in this way, you will not only gain real knowledge, but also be able to solve difficult problems even if you encounter them in the exam. Your brother has learned the secret of studying, so even though his study time is short, he has achieved results. You might as well try it!" Aimei happily received her father's guidance and knew her shortcomings, so she kept them firmly in her mind.

### About Diaries

— Shadow Dumb

A diary is a personal history. If you record the things you encounter each day, it indeed holds historical value if you occasionally browse through it later? Moreover, writing a diary every day greatly helps writing skills, far more beneficial than attending two hours of composition class each week. Understanding the value of diaries, then we can further discuss various issues related to diaries.

Before starting a diary, there is a prerequisite: persistence. This can be considered extremely difficult. We have seen many people write diaries, initially very excited, writing every day. Later, they become casual, writing when they feel like it, and not writing when they don't. Eventually, they abandon it altogether, like a snake with a tiger's head but a feeble tail, starting but not finishing. Therefore, if we don't write a diary, so be it; if we write one, we must be determined to write every day, without fail, and see it through to the end.

Finding topics for a diary is a problem. We know that the diaries we are talking about now are not like the old, rigid ones that only recorded "cloudy," "sunny," "wind," "rain," when one got up, when one ate, and who came to visit. I once told my classmates: we see and encounter many things in a day, but we don't need to record them all. What we record should be things worth recording, things that are either peculiar and rare or evoke emotions of joy or sorrow. Only then is it worth recording. It's like writing a novel, eliminating unnecessary material first. What remains should have a special purpose and be worth recording. Otherwise, what is the value of the diary?

Schools require students to write two diary entries per week. In fact, there are many things one can write about in two diary entries a week. However, most students find writing diaries a headache, mainly because they find it difficult to find topics. When grading, what is seen is all about selling rice, beggars begging, or police officers beating people, or students reading books or watching movies and just copying a section of the book or film synopsis to get by. Such diaries are really too ordinary, aren't they?

However, it must be said that students do have good topics in their diaries, just not many. I remember last year, a student wrote about how one day, after school, when he was reviewing his homework, his father came home and invited friends to play mahjong, immediately asking him to give up the table. He was writing and gave up the table a little late, which angered his father, who scolded him. He argued with his father, questioning whether playing mahjong was more important or studying. At the same time, he felt dissatisfied with family education.

Recently, a female student wrote about how the families in her building have been arguing about hiring a nanny these past few days. They went to the employment agency to hire a nanny, but the nannies either left after one meal or one night. Too many people to serve, too low wages, and lack of sanitation were all reasons why they didn't want to work, not even willing to empty the chamber pot or take care of children. Hiring a nanny is so difficult, yet every employment agency is full of women waiting to be hired. Rice costs more than one hundred yuan per [unit]. Therefore, she suspects that the distorted and contradictory nature of Shanghai society is beyond imagination.

Like the two examples above, although they cannot be considered amazing topics, they are generally more valuable diary material to record compared to what others write, more interesting, and have research value. Therefore, I specifically introduce them to the young readers of this publication. If we want to write a diary, then we must pay attention all day long and seize the topics for our diary, and not let them slip by due to negligence, otherwise, it is too regrettable.

### Cold

— Jin Zhen

The weather is erratic, suddenly cold and suddenly hot, especially noticeable these past few days. When the sun hasn't even peeked out in the morning, the air is already very stuffy. Once the sun shines, the mercury in the thermometer immediately climbs up, quickly reaching around ninety degrees, making Ah Hui feel hot even wearing a single-layer shirt. Suddenly, patches of white clouds gather rapidly, completely obscuring the sun. A whooshing sound suddenly emanates from the treetops, followed by the sound of torrential rain on the roof, coupled with flashes of lightning and booming thunder. All the conditions for a thunderstorm—thunder, lightning, wind, and rain—are finally met. In less than an hour, the wind stopped, the rain ceased, the lightning stopped flashing, the thunder stopped rumbling, and the clouds dispersed. However, the mercury in the thermometer suddenly plummeted. The difference in climate within just one hour is like two seasons—high summer and late winter. Ah Hui certainly felt a chill, but he didn't want to add another layer of clothing, which led to him catching a cold. A day later, the symptoms of a cold appeared one by one—sneezing, hoarse throat, stuffy nose, and fever. Ah Hui had to lie in bed and couldn't go to school.

His father often came to his bedside to check on him. Once, he even asked his father the question, "How do you catch a cold?"

"A cold is one of the most common diseases. It is caused by being exposed to the cold, but it is also due to bacteria. It is mostly transmitted from others, and the easiest way to transmit it is when cold bacteria spread with the wind. Once they reach our nostrils and throat, if our body is not strong, or if we are overly fatigued, have indigestion, or are chilled, these bacteria take advantage of this opportunity and quickly invade our nostrils and throat and multiply, causing inflammation and swelling, which makes us feel a stuffy nose and have a lot of mucus, and a hoarse throat. These are all the results of inflammation and swelling. When a cold occurs, you should cough and stay in bed, which are the best treatments. You should know that a cold can be transmitted to others. So, staying in bed not only cures the cold but also prevents it from being transmitted to others. There is a saying in our country that after catching a cold, one writes many red papers with the words 'Selling severe cold, success upon seeing it' and posts them on the telephone poles on the road. When others see it, the cold can be transmitted to that person, and the person can be cured. Does such a miraculous cure really exist in the world? This is completely a mindless act and shows the selfishness of our people. However, a cold is indeed contagious, but we should not intentionally transmit it to others. We should prevent the transmission of colds by living alone in a room, opening the windows to ensure ventilation, eating nutritious food, and getting enough sleep. After a week of recuperation, you can recover."

### Animals Also Participate in Human Wars

— De Gang

Children, we know from studying history that many animals can help humans in warfare. For example, in ancient China, knives were used on the horns of cattle to charge and kill enemies. In foreign countries during the Middle Ages, soldiers often took snakes or geckos and other frightening reptiles to throw into enemy camps or warships. Some also used cats or rats, carrying filth, to drive into enemy camps. Later, someone invented attaching burning wooden strips or straw to the tails of birds and letting them fly onto the roofs of enemy houses to set them on fire. There are countless ways to use animals in warfare. In modern warfare, many animals can also help humans in warfare. The most well-known are, of course, military dogs and carrier pigeons, which perform reconnaissance and deliver messages for humans. In addition to dogs and pigeons, there are dozens of other animals that can also help humans in warfare. Let me introduce them to you one by one.

The first animal I want to introduce is the pig. During World War I, the Allied forces used them in warfare. Because the German positions at that time, just like this time, were covered with minefields, it would be a very difficult and dangerous undertaking for the British and French forces to rashly attack the Germans. So someone came up with a clever way to destroy the German minefields. They drove many pigs into the German mine areas. These poor animals were completely unaware of the danger to their lives and were just running, jumping, and trampling wildly, most of them triggering the terrible mines, ending their lives and opening up the first step of difficult work for the Allied forces. During that war, in addition to pigs, the British and French forces also mobilized a lot of cattle to undertake this mine-sweeping work.

The second animal to be introduced is the horse. The horse has the noblest task in wartime, which is to carry cavalry, gallop on the battlefield, and perform search and reconnaissance work. In addition, the horse has a secondary duty: the serum in the horse's blood can treat many infectious diseases of soldiers. Recently, the German government has requisitioned a large number of farmers' draft horses for military use and released many elephants and camels from zoos to replace horses for farming and driving.

Cats also have a role in war because their sensitive sense of smell can easily detect certain kinds of poisonous gases, so cats can help prevent enemy gas attacks. In France, there is a tomb commemorating a cat because the cat accompanied its owner in the trenches all day long during World War I, and whenever the German army used poisonous gas, the cat would scratch its owner's clothes, as if telling him to quickly put on a gas mask and take precautions in advance, thus saving its owner's life many times.

Finally, I want to introduce the spider. How can spiders help in warfare? It turns out that spider silk is very useful for various optical instruments, such as rangefinders and telescopes used by artillery. Because spider silk is extremely fine and sticks to the lens, it can be used as a very accurate aiming mark. Recently, many opticians in Britain have been ordered by the government to catch large numbers of spiders in order to extract fine silk to reinforce various optical instruments used in warfare.

### Three Famous Pairs of Storytellers

— Maple

Jiang Zhu, Shen Xue, Zhu Zhao

Jiang Zhu, Shen Xue, Zhu Zhao are known as the three famous pairs of storytellers: Jiang Ruting, Zhu Jiesheng; Shen Jian'an, Xue Xiaoqing; Zhu Yaoxiang, Zhao Jiaqiu for short. Over the past decade or so, they have become famous all over Jiangnan, standing on equal footing, with no distinction in quality. Some have asked to compare their storytelling skills, I cannot answer, so I will try to describe their differences. In terms of storytelling ability: Jiang Zhu is good at "Falling Golden Fan," "Double Gold Ingots"; Shen Xue is good at "Pearl Tower"; Zhu Zhao is good at "Tears and Laughter Marriage"; these are also their famous stories. In addition, Jiang Zhu can also perform "Three Smiles," "Double Pearl Phoenix"; Shen Xue can also perform "Yang Guifei," "Tears and Laughter Marriage," (the script is different from Zhu Zhao's). Zhu Zhao can also perform "Gorgeous Romance," "Four Fragrant Romance," "Painted Golden Phoenix," "Red Robe," "Yu Tangchun," etc.; Zhu Zhao can perform the most stories.

In terms of Singing

(Tune): Jiang Zhu follows Yu; Shen Xue follows Ma, Yaoxiang follows Ma, Jiaqiu follows Yu, Jiang Zhu follows Yu and is very similar! Shen Xue follows Ma but is slightly different; Zhu Zhao follows Ma and Yu but is very different; some say it is a free tune. Jiesheng's singing is soft and glutinous; Xiaoqing's singing is clear and salty; he has the reputation of a golden voice; Jiaqiu's singing is lively. Ruting sings Yu's tune and is no weaker than Jiesheng. Jian'an's singing is better because of its richness and charm. However, since his voice failed, it has been difficult to please. Commentators say that his charm still exists, which is appropriate. Yaoxiang's singing is heavy and thick, which is also acceptable.

In terms of playing

The two pairs are closely coordinated. Jiang Zhu's playing is subtle and quiet; Shen Xue's playing is bright and loud. Especially when Jiesheng sings Yu's gentle tune, Ruting's sanxian accompanies the tune with high and low, fast and slow, and adds ups and downs to the music, which is even more superb.

In terms of Speaking

Jiang Zhu is known for being steady; Shen Xue is known for being unrestrained; Zhu Zhao is known for being detailed. Ruting is best at playing the roles in the stories, such as Lu Fu in "Falling Golden Fan," Qi Ziqing in "Double Gold Ingots," and Little Erguan. His portrayals of Lu Fu's foolishness and Little Er's naughtiness are vivid and lifelike, and listeners cannot help but laugh. Jian'an's descriptions of Fang's mother missing her son and the aunt's snobbery are exhaustive. Therefore, Shen Xue's "Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Meeting" and "Aunt and Niece Arguing in the Ziwu Hall" are still popular. Zhu Zhao is especially good at portraying the scene; the warlord is tyrannical, the weak woman is aggrieved, the knight is righteous, the talented man is affectionate, not only is it expressed in words, but also in form, with meticulous depiction, and is quite like painting. Yaoxiang is even better at various dialects, which is unmatched by others.

Jiang Zhu is like the Beijing Chao school in Peking Opera, because they follow the old methods without the slightest hesitation. Zhu Zhao is like the Shanghai school in Peking Opera, because they slightly improve the old methods and create vernacular openings. Shen Xue is in between the two, and their speaking also mixes new terms.

In terms of Physical State

Ruting likes football in his spare time and is currently the president of the Guangyu Club Football Club. Jiesheng is even better at Kunqu Opera, "Selling Horses" and "Chunxiang Makes Trouble in School" are his representative works. Jian'an's voice has failed, and people call him the Qipai storyteller. Junqing likes to sing Henan Opera in his spare time, following Xiang Wan Hua. Qipai storytelling paired with a Meipai amateur is truly an elegant thing. Zhu Zhao can also perform Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera; he can also perform stage plays. He once performed in the play "Peach Blossom Fan" at the Oriental Drama Troupe!

Ruting has dark skin, and Jiesheng is blind in one eye. Jian'an is [unclear], Xiao [unclear] is fat; Yaoxiang is tall, and Jiaqiu is short. These are the differences in the physical forms of the six people. And the fat ones are paired with the thin ones, and the tall ones are matched with the short ones, which is interesting! All of the above are just the highlights. Due to space limitations, the details will not be elaborated here. This spring, Jiang Zhu retired from the storytelling scene, and Shen Xue announced the separation of the pair. Only Zhu Zhao can still be heard in the storytelling scene, which makes people feel a sense of the vicissitudes of life!

### "Siege" Stage Scene

### An Outline of the Philosophy of Strenuous Practice

— Zong Yu

Those who engage in physical labor should also engage in mental labor, and those who engage in mental labor should also engage in physical labor. Physical and mental labor should not be separated. Everyone can produce, and everyone can seek improvements in production technology. The misconception that those who engage in mental labor govern others, and those who engage in physical labor are governed by others, must be completely eradicated.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 9: Why Did You Come to the End of the World, My Lord?

Liu Yin Ying's aunt called from outside, "The guest has come from afar. You should let him rest early. We can talk more tomorrow." Liu Yin Yang was reminded by his aunt's words and stood up and said, "Brother, please rest. We will talk more tomorrow. There is a small bedroom behind the library that can be used as a guest room. Please sleep there." Xu Jing said, "Thank you for your kindness." So Liu Yin Ying lit the candle and led Xu Jing to the inner room. It was indeed very small. Xu Jing's luggage was already placed on the kang, and everything had been arranged for him. There was a small door behind the room that led to the kitchen, but it was already locked. Xu Jing looked at it and said, "Very good. The room doesn't have to be big. As long as there is a kang, I can sleep well. Thank you, thank you." Liu Yin Ying placed the candlestick on a small table next to the kang and said, "There is no need to be polite between brothers. See you tomorrow." After saying this, he turned around and walked to the small room. Xu Jing met a new friend today and felt comforted by their compatible conversation. He also felt that Liu Yin Ying's dart skills were superb and his swordsmanship was also high, which could be called a unique skill. How could he compare to him? It was an honor to make such a friend. So, when he went to sleep on the kang, he didn't think about the shame of being expelled from the Wang family, and he felt like he was in a sweet dream. When he woke up, it was already dawn. After getting up, a small maid brought face water. Xu Jing washed his face, rinsed his mouth, combed his hair, and dressed neatly before walking outside. Liu Yin Ying was already sitting outside waiting, and they had breakfast together. That day, Xu Jing and Liu Yin Ying sat and talked in the morning, and in the afternoon, they took a walk on the ridge and returned. Liu Yin Ying's aunt was also hospitable and invited Xu Jing to eat and drink large bowls of wine and large pieces of meat. After staying for a few days, they felt very harmonious. Xu Jing felt a little uneasy. He wanted to go to the Wang family as soon as possible to act according to the planned plan, to make Wang Yongtai understand who was a good person and who was a bad person, and then he could come forward and introduce Liu Yin Ying to General Zhou Yuji to work together. So, on the afternoon of the fourth day, when Liu Yin Ying was not around, he sat alone in the study, looked up at the beams, and thought for a long time, and couldn't help but sigh, "I will do it this way. I must clear the injustice suffered by others, and also eliminate the source of trouble for him, regardless of whether he is annoyed or not. (72)
