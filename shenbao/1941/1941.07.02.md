### Soviet Union Forms Defense Committee to Concentrate Forces for Resistance to the End; Tank Battle Unfolds on Minsk Front; German Offensive Near Murmansk Repelled

TASS, Moscow, 1st: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and the Council of People's Commissars, in view of the state of emergency and to rapidly mobilize all Soviet national forces to resist the enemy, consider it necessary to take the following steps: (1) Organize a Defense Committee, composed of five members, including Stalin (Chairman), Molotov (Vice Chairman), Voroshilov, Malenkov, and Beria; (2) Concentrate all national forces under the Defense Committee; (3) Order all citizens, party members, and military organs to strictly comply with the orders and resolutions of the Defense Committee. Signed by Kalinin, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

Reuters, London, 1st: German and Soviet troops, each with large tank corps and aircraft, continue to fight fiercely along the entire line from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. Claims of victories by both sides have not yet been confirmed. German military circles in Berlin stated that German forces have already occupied Dunaburg and Jekabpils, and have also captured Lipo (Lithuanian border), leaving little chance for retreat for the troops in the three regions of Vilna, Dunaburg, and Riga. German military circles also claim that they have now destroyed 4,500 Soviet aircraft, and German submarines and torpedo boats have sunk four Soviet destroyers, one torpedo boat, and three submarines since the start of the war. However, Berlin also acknowledges that Soviet forces are still fiercely resisting as before. Moscow claims that two German submarines were sunk in the Baltic Sea and one in the Black Sea.

According to an announcement by the Soviet Information Bureau: "On June 30th, enemy forces launched an offensive along the entire Soviet-Finnish border, which has been repelled by our forces. Fierce fighting is underway with reserve forces in the Murmansk area, and the enemy has suffered heavy losses. In the Vilna and Tver areas, our forces are fiercely fighting motorized units attempting to break through to the northeast. The enemy forces in this area are numerous, but our forces are acting swiftly and fighting resolutely. In the Minsk and Baranovichi areas, our forces are fighting fiercely against numerous enemy mobile units, holding intermediate positions to block the enemy's advance. Tank battles continue in the Kovno area, and the enemy's repeated attempts to break through to the east have been severely damaged and repulsed. A large-scale tank battle occurred in this area, destroying a large number of German tanks. In the Bessarabia border area, enemy forces made another attempt to forcibly cross the Prut River, but were swiftly and painfully repulsed by our forces, and the enemy suffered significant losses." The communiqué then detailed the heroic deeds of Soviet soldiers and small-scale clashes.

Reuters, London, 1st: German attempts to reach Murmansk on the Arctic Ocean, penetrate deep into White Russia, and break into Ukraine from Volhynia continued fiercely yesterday. However, the Soviet Union announced that it had halted the advance of German mechanized units in the south and is currently resisting the Nazi offensive in White Russia. According to German announcements, a total of 280 Soviet aircraft were shot down in yesterday's battles. The latest frontline news only contains unconfirmed reports from the German side, stating that German tank columns are advancing along the highway from Minsk to Moscow at high speed. It is reported that Soviet forces are currently putting up a strong resistance. The Soviet communiqué issued this morning did not confirm the German claim that it had occupied Minsk, the capital of White Russia, but only stated that Soviet forces are currently fighting fiercely with superior German mobile units near Minsk and are blocking their advance. South of the Pinsk Marshes, German forces launched a fierce attack on Kiev. According to Soviet announcements, their advance has also been blocked. It is reported that there have been continued tank battles between the two armies. The Soviet Union announced that all German attempts to advance eastward have been severely damaged and have failed. In the southwest of this area, the Soviet Union admitted that it had withdrawn from Lviv (Lemberg) because the rear of the city was threatened. In the Baltic states to the north, another major battle is currently taking place between Vilna and Tver. At the southern end of the battle line, according to a Soviet communiqué, German forces again attempted to forcibly cross the Prut River, but were again severely damaged and repulsed. On the Finnish border, there is currently fierce fighting near Murmansk, and the German offensive has been repelled.

Havas, Moscow, 1st: Official reports state that Soviet troops in the north have moved to new positions in the Murmansk port area. The breakthrough into Minsk continues to advance, completing a breakthrough of 300 kilometers on the front line. From here, German forces are halfway along the highway east to Moscow. Although there is no accurate estimate at present, it is widely believed that German forces are 600 kilometers away from Moscow. The latest news arriving here last night stated that the German command has once again adopted a strategy of large-scale encirclement with great success, and has now separated and nearly crushed several large Soviet armies. This encirclement is based at the following strongholds: (1) east of Bialystok; (2) between Minsk and Smolensk; (3) south of Riga in Latvia. Many observers believe that there is a fourth encirclement area in the south, located south of the Pripyat Marshes, before Hungary, but this has not been officially confirmed. German military spokesmen declined to comment on whether there were any battles on the "Stalin Line," but stated, "Is there any defensive line in Europe more solid than the Maginot Line? We pay no attention to it, as German armored units can break through at various military strongholds and encircle them locally." Therefore, the so-called "Stalin Line" will be useless for defense. Authoritative German spokesmen announced last night that German forces have occupied Minsk, an important transportation hub in White Russia, and are continuing their eastward advance towards Moscow. The official German news agency also stated yesterday that Nazi troops have completely surrounded a Red Army division on the Baltic coast, and that another reserve column is advancing towards the Rava-Ruska area, striking.

Berlin Claims Victory, Penetrating 300 Kilometers into Soviet Territory

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 1st: German forces hung the German military flag in Lviv (Lemberg) at 4:20 AM yesterday. German forces won a great victory in the Lemberg campaign in the autumn of 1939 and occupied the city again yesterday after fierce fighting.

United Press, Berlin, 1st: German forces have consolidated their occupied positions in Lviv (Lemberg), Minsk, and Jekabpils in Latvia, which are major Soviet bases, and are continuing to advance rapidly to encircle the trapped Red Army corps on the Eastern Front. German vanguards are crushing Soviet troops in the area with lightning speed, destroying or capturing hundreds of Soviet tanks. Forty-two 11-centimeter Red Army mortars have also fallen into German hands during the war. A military authority stated, "We can consider that a new encirclement area has been formed between Minsk and Smolensk."

German Forces Bypass Minsk and Advance on Moscow Highway

United Press, Moscow, 1st: Last night's war communiqué acknowledged the loss of Lviv, but stated that Soviet forces are still blocking the Nazi advance on other fronts.

Havas, Stockholm, Sweden, 30th: According to Soviet radio broadcasts, fierce fighting continues on the Soviet border. German mechanized units in the central sector have bypassed Minsk, the capital of the White Russian Soviet Socialist Republic, and are advancing forward, but the city is still in the hands of the Red Army. In the southern sector, German armored divisions have invaded Soviet territory from the Volhynia region of Russian Poland, advancing towards Zhytomyr, seemingly aiming for Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In the Lviv area (northwest of Volhynia), Soviet forces have withdrawn part of their troops due to fear of encirclement and are now deploying new positions along the Sluch River. The city of Lviv was once the center of the Greek Orthodox Church and is now the spiritual center of the entire Western Ukraine. By capturing this city, Germany may attempt to rally the Ukrainian people to engage in anti-Soviet activities.

International News Service, Berlin, 1st: Official sources announced that Hitler's troops are today advancing from Smolensk towards Moscow along the Minsk-Moscow highway. Smolensk remains the only obstacle on the vast avenue across the Soviet capital. The fall of Lviv has enabled the two armies to control the rich oil fields of Ukraine and the important railways and highways to the Black Sea. It is rumored that tens of thousands of Soviet troops have been heavily surrounded by German forces and will be completely annihilated unless they surrender quickly.

United Press, Berlin, 1st: German military reports today stated that German mechanized columns are now advancing towards Moscow at an unstoppable speed from Minsk, the newly occupied capital of White Russia, along the 410-mile route, as part of a four-pronged encirclement strategy. An authoritative spokesman stated that a new encirclement area is currently developing in the Minsk and Smolensk area, which can be predicted. The official German news agency, Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, stated that German forces are now fighting east of Minsk. Nazi bombers are attempting to cut off the retreat of Soviet forces, destroying eight bridges and damaging another bridge that was already damaged in the previous attack, making the position of Soviet forces in White Russia even more dangerous.

First Air Raid Alert in Soviet Capital, Leningrad Prepares for Defense

Havas, Moscow, 1st: An air raid alert was issued here at 1:50 AM this morning and was not lifted until 2:45 AM. This is the first alert issued in Moscow since the outbreak of the current European war.

Havas, New York, 30th: According to Moscow sources, the people of Leningrad and its surrounding cities have been ordered to mobilize and participate in domestic defense work.

Haitong, Stockholm, Sweden, 1st: Leningrad has taken drastic measures, forcibly mobilizing civilians to dig trenches in the suburbs.

Havas, Berlin, 1st: German forces in the north entered the city of Midava in Latvia this morning. The city is only 40 kilometers away from Riga, the capital of Latvia.

Editorial

### Prospects for the German-Soviet War

This German-Soviet war can be considered the most ferocious and largest-scale event in history. According to general objective estimates, the Soviet Union can mobilize 12 million troops. In 1939, it had 10,000 to 12,000 aircraft and at least 20,000 tanks, plus a large number of armored vehicles and countless vehicles that can be converted into tanks. Germany, on the other hand, can mobilize about 8 million troops, 9,000 to 10,000 aircraft, and 11,000 tanks, plus a large number of armored vehicles and countless vehicles that can be converted into tanks. With the arms expansion of the two countries in the past two years, the current numbers are probably at least double those of 1939. However, it is worth noting here: (1) The Soviet Union has been actively preparing for war for two years, expanding its weapons without any depletion; (2) Although Germany has consumed a lot in the past two years, the weapons plundered from various conquered countries and the increased manufacturing capacity are probably sufficient to compensate and more. With the vastness of these two war machines and the ferocity of their destructive power, imagining the future, the war will inevitably be prolonged, and human civilization will be devastated, which is truly lamentable!

For more than a week, the Soviet Union has slightly retreated, and most of its troops have moved towards the old borders before September 1939. The territories it has expanded in the past two years are mostly undefended, or the defenses have not yet been completed. In the face of the fierce German offensive, it is inevitable that it must retreat to favorable areas to engage in a major battle. As for Germany, at the beginning of the war, there were exaggerated claims of resolving the Red Army within six weeks, but as it looks now, there is absolutely no possibility of this being realized. The most notable aspect of German strategy is that the overwhelming superiority of air force and tanks, which it has consistently maintained in the Western European, Northern European, and Balkan campaigns, has obviously completely disappeared. Therefore, one of the prerequisites for the "blitzkrieg" no longer exists. The even strength of the Soviet paratroopers and the sweeping movements of the cavalry have given the Eastern European war a brand new face.

Modern warfare is a very complex matter. If one does not use a comprehensive perspective, combining geography, history, politics, economics, and even racial qualities, and only looks at military equipment and resources, it is impossible to obtain a more accurate judgment. The current international situation is changing rapidly, and every national organization and social order has the potential to have a decisive impact in the course of the war. Therefore, the final outcome of any war can only be answered by facts. We will now tentatively predict the future based on the current situation, and the future of this German-Soviet war can be stated, generally no more than the following points:

First, assuming that the German army concentrates its forces to occupy Ukraine and break into the Middle East, the remaining routes are only to contain or disperse Soviet forces. If our expectations are not false, it may be able to temporarily break through the Soviet defense line, occupy key areas along the Black Sea coast, and control the Black Sea, and then either from the Soviet Caucasus or through Turkey to achieve its goals. However, the biggest problem is that this plan has consistently failed to have a decisive impact on the war situation. The massive Soviet military force can still, at any time and place, rush to Romania in one fell swoop to cut off the German army's retreat.

Second, assuming that the German army's goal is to defeat the main force of the Red Army, then it has no choice but to advance simultaneously on all fronts, and must at least occupy Moscow and Leningrad. Now, leaving aside the strength of the Soviet military, in terms of distance and geographical conditions alone, Germany's move is already a very risky undertaking. If the Soviet Union implements a long-term resistance strategy, moving its bases to the Ural region on the border of Europe and Asia, while doing its best to harass and attack the German army's rear transportation routes, it is impossible for the German army to continue chasing into the Asian part of the Soviet Union. The final result will inevitably be to follow in Napoleon's footsteps, with the entire army being wiped out, or at least to replay the story of the Allied powers' siege of the Soviet Union after the European war, and finally withdraw from Soviet territory.

Third, the Soviet authorities have repeatedly stated that their supreme strategy is to fight in enemy territory. Therefore, as soon as the German offensive is slightly frustrated, it may launch a counter-offensive against Germany. With a long battle line of more than a thousand miles, at least at some points and lines, it can attack the territories occupied by Germany before the war. At that time, the front line will inevitably become a tangled confrontation, and the advance and retreat will inevitably result in a tug-of-war, eventually leading to a large-scale war of attrition, with the strength of the two countries' resources as the decisive factor in the final victory or defeat.

Fourth, assuming that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union cooperate and proceed smoothly, Britain and the Soviet Union will inevitably fight side by side and coordinate a strategy with aligned interests. Now, because the German air force is heavily concentrated in the East, it has already caused its own country to be severely attacked by the British air force and cannot resist. If the British naval and land forces are deployed simultaneously in the future, on the one hand, the navy can rush into the Black Sea and other places to closely cooperate with the Soviet army, and launch large-scale bombardments of German land forces in all coastal areas. At the same time, it can also pass through Turkey or land in various places and launch a general offensive against the German army. Then, the entire war situation will immediately change, and Germany will inevitably fight on many fronts simultaneously, which is most unfavorable to Germany.

Correction: In the eleventh line of the editorial of this newspaper, "慕天顏壽", the character "顏" was mistakenly printed as "歌". We hereby correct this.

Finnish Army Attacks Hanko Island Fiercely; Soviet Aircraft Attack Finland with Phosphorus Bombs

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 1st: The Soviet troops stationed on Hanko Island refused Finland's request to surrender in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. The Finnish artillery then opened fire and bombarded the island. Hanko was ceded to the Soviet Union during the ceasefire in 1940 and is located at the entrance of the Gulf of Finland, a peninsula with strong fortifications. According to Swedish news agency reports, there were fierce battles all day yesterday near the Soviet base near Karjaa, 100 kilometers west of Helsinki. Soviet aircraft used high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs to cover the countryside around their Hanko base. Finnish artillery constantly returned fire at Soviet aircraft. Aftonbladet's Helsinki correspondent reported last night that Finnish troops had begun to attack Hanko. According to reports from Helsinki, various parts of Finland were attacked by air, killing four people and injuring three. Several houses caught fire.

United Press, Helsinki, 1st: Soviet troops defending the Hanko fortress (ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union after the end of the Soviet-Finnish War last year) began using phosphorus bombs yesterday. Even if the bombs fall in the damp forests of Finland, they will cause fires. Soviet aircraft also dropped a large number of explosive and incendiary bombs on key Finnish positions. The intensity of the Soviet artillery fire from the Hanko fortress is greater than in the winter war, as phosphorus bombs easily cause fires in the forests around the fortress. Soviet aircraft bombing Finnish troops on the Mannerheim Line apparently flew from airfields near Paldiski or Tallinn, and also bombed Finland's eastern defense line.

British Military Expert Reviews the War Situation; Prolonged Resistance is Advantageous to the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 1st: Reuters military commentator General Gough reviewed the Soviet-German war, stating that the general position on the Soviet-German front has seen little change in the past few days. This matter is quite important and very favorable to the Soviet side. Although the German side had exhausted its tanks and other armored forces in advance and concentrated a large number of aircraft to launch a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, it has not yet broken through the Soviet line of defense at any point on the 1,500-mile border. In the far north, the German forces in Finland and on the southern side, from Suroty along the Prut River to the Black Sea, are firmly blocked. In fact, the current Soviet troops have already taken on signs of an offensive. Even if this offensive is launched on a short front line with limited objectives, it is still quite important. On the far left, Soviet troops have crossed the Danube River and attacked Romanian territory, capturing as many as a thousand enemies and seizing ten artillery pieces. Soviet troops slightly to the north have driven German troops across the Prut River. Regarding the communiqués of the two armies, the Soviet side is very clear, giving a reliable impression, while the German announcements are not, lacking definite statements, only issuing boasts of occupation and vague promises of great victories somewhere. As far as we can judge, the German army on the northern route has occupied Lithuania with only weakly stationed covering forces of the Soviet side, and has stopped at the line of Siauliai, Kaunas, and Vilnius. The German line of defense in this area seems to have turned south, extending through Grodno towards Baranovichi, or further south to the Pripyat Marshes near Pinsk, and then turning southwest to the vicinity of Lutsk and Brody. Major battles are currently taking place in this area. This campaign has so far been unfavorable to the German side. Soviet forces in this area are now defending the northern side of the salient in Soviet territory, which extends from the Brody area through Lviv to Przemyśl, and then turns back along the Carpathian Mountains to Suroty. From this point, Soviet forces are firmly defending the southern side of the salient, along the Prut River to the Black Sea. If there are no major changes in this situation, it also indicates that the German attack has been repelled. The German side stated that a German armored team has crossed Minsk and reached the highway leading to Moscow. This German team should not have reached Minsk from the direct advance from Brest-Litovsk and Baranovichi, but was attacked by German forces from the side after the German forces attacked Vilnius to form a salient. Starting from this direction, German forces can flank the Soviet forces who are currently preventing the German forces from advancing towards Minsk from Brest-Litovsk, Baranovichi in the east and southeast. Regarding the effectiveness of Soviet military deployments and tactics, our concept must be greatly improved. Soviet troops have demonstrated that they are indeed the enemy of the German army and have caused the German army to suffer significant losses. This has a profound psychological and spiritual impact, enabling Soviet troops to take the offensive. Soviet attacks have been launched in several directions, and Britain can also help with one arm. Judging from the current situation, Britain will soon be able to take advantage of the opportunity of the German army's involvement in the Soviet Union and launch an offensive in Cyrenaica, North Africa.

### Diplomatic Missions in Germany and Italy Ordered to Return Home by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; China to Join the British, American, and Soviet Front; International Situation Becomes Clearer

Chongqing: The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a telegram on July 1st ordering the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, the Chargé d'Affaires to Italy, and all personnel of the Chinese embassies in Germany and Italy to withdraw and return home. It is also reported that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will issue another statement (1st dispatch).

International Situation Becomes Clearer

Reuters, Chongqing, 1st:

According to Chinese sources here, the recognition of the Nanjing regime by Germany and Italy seems to be leading to China severing diplomatic relations with Berlin and Rome, and the war spreading to the Far East. Chinese sources are not surprised by this development and believe that it may ultimately benefit Chongqing, as this matter will formally make the Chongqing government join the same camp as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and will make it unnecessary for Chongqing to maintain merely formal relations thereafter. This development has caused widespread speculation as to whether this step by the Axis powers is a condition to induce Japan to join the war against the Soviet Union. Chinese sources are now eagerly awaiting Japan's future actions, which may make the international situation and Chongqing's position in the current war even clearer. Germany has never sent a successor since it recalled its ambassador to China, Trautmann, in 1939, and the Italian ambassador has also remained in Shanghai for a long time and has never come to Chongqing.

Berlin: The official German news agency, Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, announced today that Germany has recognized the Wang Jingwei regime in Nanjing. Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur also stated that Italy has also recognized it. The recognition of the Nanjing regime took effect today, and diplomatic representatives will be exchanged soon (1st United Press dispatch).

Bucharest, Romania: The Romanian government has recently decided to recognize Nanjing (30th Havas dispatch).

### One Japanese Plane Shot Down by China While Attacking Chongqing; Three Others Damaged by Chinese Fire; Civilian Residences Destroyed by Bombing

Chongqing: Forty-eight Japanese planes attacked Chongqing in two batches on the 30th. The first batch of twenty-five planes and the second batch of twenty-three planes invaded the city and its northern suburbs at 11:11 AM and 11:49 AM respectively, dropping bombs and then fleeing. When the Japanese planes invaded the city's airspace, they were met with fierce fire from the Chinese anti-aircraft units. One plane was seen smoking and catching fire, and then plunged downwards, making its return doubtful. Three other planes were also injured and lagged behind. Over a hundred civilian residences were destroyed, with more than a dozen people killed or injured, according to reports. (30th Dispatch)

British Embassy Will Not Relocate

Chongqing: The residence of Mr. Blackburn, a counselor at the British Embassy, was destroyed by a bomb on Sunday. Mr. Blackburn suffered a shattered jaw and is reportedly recuperating in the hospital. Other injured British citizens are also said to be gradually recovering. It is understood that the British Embassy will not relocate due to the bombing and is already being repaired and will resume operations as usual. However, Mr. Blackburn will need to find another place to live due to the destruction of his house. (1st United Press Dispatch)

Japanese Newspaper Warns Foreign Residents in Chongqing

Tokyo: The "Guangzhi Bao," the official newspaper of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, published an editorial today warning foreigners residing in Chongqing to leave, otherwise they would be inviting disaster from bombing and would have no one to blame. The Japanese bombing of Chongqing should make foreign residents recognize the unnecessary danger of living in a military zone. Therefore, foreign governments should take responsibility and remove their government agencies and representatives from Chongqing for the duration of the war. No country, no matter what, can use its military force to protect a certain house or agency within the bombing zone. Even in Europe, nationals of neutral countries residing in warring countries are prepared to suffer losses. When the capitals of warring countries are bombed, the interests of other countries are inevitably damaged. Chongqing is currently under siege and is subject to air attacks. Civil law cannot be applied, and military law must be used. Therefore, within a fortress like Chongqing today, there can be no human rights or civil law. All people within the fortress are subject to military attack. Anyone who remains in Chongqing should bear the risk themselves, as the entire city of Chongqing is a military target and no property enjoys special exemptions. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek should also be responsible for urging foreigners to leave the dangerous area. It is an excessive hope that Chinese people wish that the presence of foreign missionaries would reduce the Japanese bombing. (1st United Press Dispatch)

### Reincarnation of the Panchen Lama; Spiritual Child Found

Kangding: News of the Panchen Lama's reincarnation in Kang Province and the search for his reincarnated spiritual child by the Office of the Dalai Lama has already been disclosed. Zhongyiba Deng and others, who were dispatched to Kang, arrived at the beginning of this month and immediately divided into two groups, north and south, to investigate. They have now found a spiritual child named Maotu Dengduoji in Zhuosang, Lihua County. He is from Zhedotang, Kangding, and was born on the second day of the eleventh month of the 27th year of the Republic of China in the lunar calendar. His father's name is Tuba Luoyang, originally from Zhuba, Tibet, and his mother's name is Gesang Quedeng, from Zhuosang. The spiritual child and his parents are currently living in the Zhuosang Huila Temple. Baden set out on the 12th to return to Ganzi to report on his mission. It is also reported that Dingjie Buddha, who resides in Anjue Temple here, has also gone to Ganzi to handle matters related to the reincarnation of the Lama. (30th Dispatch)

### China Determined to Fight to the End; Establish a New World Order; Fight Aggression Together with Democratic Countries; Relations Between China and the United States Become Closer

Chongqing: The new Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi told reporters yesterday afternoon that China would never accept any peace terms that are merely cosmetic or any negotiated settlement that would be detrimental to China's important rights. China had already made the decision to fight to the end when it was fighting alone. Now that we are not alone and have comrades gathered around us, China will of course continue to fight. It is gratifying that democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are now closely cooperating to fight aggression together. China is willing to contribute to creating a new world order in which all countries can live in an atmosphere of peace and friendship, without fear or lack. When reporters asked about the authority of President Roosevelt's personal representative in Chongqing, Lattimore, Foreign Minister Guo replied that he had not yet had time to study the telegrams exchanged regarding this matter, but this appointment could be regarded as a sign of Sino-American political cooperation or close cooperation between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Roosevelt. When reporters asked about the exchange of ambassadors between China and Australia, Guo said that he and Australian Prime Minister Menzies had discussed this matter in London. Although an agreement has been reached, the ambassador to Australia has not yet been appointed. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

The Communist Party Expresses its Determination to Unite and Fight

Chongqing: Xinhua Daily published an essay on the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, stating that no matter what the international or domestic situation may be, the Chinese Communist Party has always maintained its determination to resist and build. In the past twenty years, our party has become an important driving force not only in Chinese politics but also in world politics. Our party is not only the proletariat party of China but also the party of the Chinese people. Our party cooperated with the Kuomintang to eliminate the Northern Warlords, and when Japan launched the war, our party immediately cooperated with the Kuomintang again. Today, we can announce to the world that no matter how the international and domestic situation changes, we will insist on uniting internally to fight against Japan and international fascism in order to realize China's independence and lasting world peace. (1st United Press Dispatch)

### Konoe Tells American Reporters That Japan Is Willing to Repair Relations with the United States; There Is No Reason Why the Two Countries Cannot Be Friendly; Willing to Abide by Treaties with Germany and the Soviet Union

United Press, Tokyo, 1st: Japanese Prime Minister Konoe said in a meeting with reporters today that Japan very much hopes to maintain friendship with the United States. In fact, there is no reason why the two countries cannot maintain friendship. When reporters met, Japanese dignitaries arrived at the Prime Minister's residence one after another, waiting to consult with Konoe. In the week since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Konoe has held dozens of meetings on this major issue. The Prime Minister seemed to be in good health and calm. He said that Japan is very willing to abide by various treaties, whether they are with Germany or the Soviet Union. Germany may be able to defeat the Soviet Union on the Western front, but he does not believe that the Soviet Union will collapse completely or that Stalin's rule will be overthrown. The overall situation in the world is now extremely delicate, but it can be predicted that the German army will not pass through Siberia and reach the Pacific Ocean. When reporters asked if there was any possibility of a change in US-Japan relations, Konoe said, "We very much hope to maintain friendship with the United States. The purpose of the German-Japanese alliance was to keep the United States out of the situation, so it is purely defensive in nature. We deeply hope that the American side understands this." These words were in English and were very clear. Other questions and answers were in Japanese and translated by interpreters. When reporters asked if the combination of American material resources and Japanese shipping would become a major force in the world, Konoe replied, "Indeed." During the meeting, Konoe was first filmed for newsreels, and then several still photos were taken.

### U.S. Congress Passes New Budget

United Press, Washington, 1st: On the eve of the end of the fiscal year ending in July yesterday, the U.S. Congress passed six annual appropriation bills totaling US$14,100,000,000, thus increasing the budget for 1942 to US$32,500,000,000, creating the highest record in American history. During the last European war, the U.S. budget for 1919 reached a peak of US$27,000,000,000, but it was still not as large as this time. However, this US$32,500,000,000 budget is not the absolute maximum, as the US$30 billion to US$50 billion listed in the new Lend-Lease Act is not included, nor is the supplementary funding that President Roosevelt may request. The six cases passed yesterday were: (1) Extending the duration of the Commodity Credit Corporation for two years and increasing its lending authority. (2) The Second Supplemental Appropriation Act. (3) The Federal Securities Act. (4) The Legislative Appropriation Act. (5) The Department of Labor Appropriation Act. (6) The District of Columbia Appropriation Act.

United Press, Washington, 1st: Yesterday, Congress passed three budget bills totaling US$330 billion, including US$10 billion for the Department of Agriculture, US$1,196,000,000 for the Department of Labor and the Department of the Interior, and US$24 million for Congress. The bill has now been sent to President Roosevelt for review.

### Lattimore's Arrival in China Is of Great Significance

Reuters, Chongqing, 1st: The Central Daily News stated that the appointment of Lattimore as an advisor to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is not the beginning of technical assistance to China from abroad, but his appointment is of great significance. The United States has agreed to aid countries resisting aggression and is now providing financial aid to China and transporting defense materials to China. Now, the United States has appointed Fox as a member of the Stabilization Fund Committee and Lattimore as a personal political advisor, which shows that the United States is providing all possible assistance to China. Moreover, the United States has made these two appointments after Japan repeatedly warned Western countries against interfering in the Far East, so it must be considered a direct blow to Japan. Lattimore's appointment as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's personal political advisor and Hummel as an advisor to the Executive Yuan, both of whom have a full understanding of and express sympathy for China, will make a significant contribution to promoting closer Sino-American cooperation. In addition to the need for overseas financial and material assistance in the current war against Japan, China also needs technical assistance, which will be even more valuable in the post-war period of national reconstruction. Therefore, the above-mentioned appointments not only indicate close cooperation between the two countries at present but also in the future. Lattimore was recommended by President Roosevelt to serve as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's personal advisor. This clearly shows the close cooperation and understanding between the leaders of the two countries.

### Japan Is Repeatedly Tricked by Germany; Has Lost Its Bearings; The War Against China Has Exhausted the Country; Farmers Are Unable to Buy Fertilizer and Crop Yields Are Far Lower Than Before

Reuters, London, 1st: Even Japan is now showing signs of panic over Hitler's wild ambitions. Newspapers that have always strongly supported the Axis powers, such as Kokumin Shimbun, are now saying that if the Axis hegemony crosses the Ural Mountains and enters the Russian territory of Asia, Japan will encounter serious problems. Therefore, it is urgent to clearly delineate the geographical boundaries between Hitler's "new order" and Japan's "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." London circles now believe that the German announcement of the first week of the war against the Soviet Union was partly aimed at moving Japan to attack the Soviet Union as well. If this is true, the result seems to be the opposite of Hitler's hopes. Japan is now showing signs of unusual shock. In 1936, Japan and Germany became close and formed the Anti-Comintern Pact, vowing to jointly resist communism and all activities of the Communist Party. In 1939, Hitler suddenly vowed to be friendly with the Bolshevik Party, which he had previously denounced, without telling Japan a word. In 1940, Hitler again manipulated the greed of Japanese imperialists by taking advantage of the collapse of France and wooed Japan to conclude the Tripartite Pact. In April 1940, Hitler continued to use his influence in Tokyo and Moscow to achieve the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. Less than three months after the agreement was signed, before the ink was dry, Hitler again invaded the Soviet territory with a large army without informing Japan, and overturned all of Japan's plans. Since the occurrence of this recent conspiracy, the highest-ranking naval, military, and civilian officials in Tokyo have been meeting almost daily at the Prime Minister's residence. This is very sufficient to prove the annoyance of Japan, and the lost of bearings. Such a meeting is usually held only once a week. Japan cannot take any action at this time, because the Soviet-German war was an attack by Germany on the Soviet Union, not an attack by the Soviet Union on Germany. According to the provisions of the Tripartite Pact, Japan has no obligation to assist Germany, and its agreement with the Soviet Union clearly guarantees Japan's neutrality. However, the younger generation of Japanese military officers, who in 1933 wanted to seize the Soviet Maritime Province while the Soviet Union's military strength in the Far East was still weak, in order to consolidate Japan's position in Manchuria, will now rise up and argue that Japan must not lose this good opportunity to eliminate the Soviet Far East Army and use it as an excuse to prevent Hitler from appearing in Asia. The more clear-headed Japanese say that if Japan attacks the Soviet Union at this time, it will simultaneously start a war against Britain, or even a war against the United States. Japan's recent quiet acceptance of the Dutch East Indies authorities' rejection of its demands is sufficient to clearly indicate that it does not want to take this risky action. In addition to all kinds of speculations, there are two important points that Japan can never ignore: one is the infinite consumption of the war against China, and the other is the increasing obviousness of the exhaustion of Japan's own resources. Since the Japanese army's efforts to encircle and eliminate the main force of the Chinese army in China with four times the effort and great offensives have completely failed, large-scale battles in China have ceased during this hot season. However, the tactics of the Chinese army are still causing the Japanese army to die constantly. There is much evidence of this. According to recently published figures, Japan admits that by the end of last year, the number of Japanese soldiers killed or wounded in the war against China was over one million. Japan's agricultural harvest in 1940 was much lower than in 1939, and this year's harvest is expected to be 15% lower than last year. The main reason is that farmers are poor and unable to buy much fertilizer, and there is a lack of tenant labor due to young men joining the army in China. According to a government survey of 800 domestic factories, most of which are heavy industries, workers are malnourished and overworked. This is also a gift of war. Among the 2.2 million workers in 1940, 584,150 had accidents. Although not all of them died, it can be said that there are countless small unfortunate events that are not worth including in the statistics. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Siberian railway has been blocked, and the only remaining channel for Japanese trade with Europe has been blocked. Therefore, all Japanese newspapers are in a state of anxiety. The war against China costs a lot, and the public debt is relied upon to provide funds. Now it is becoming increasingly difficult to raise debt. All of these are the effects of imperialism without knowing one's own strength. The more cautious people in the country may now be aware of this and do not want to take a new path to avoid one mistake after another.

Japan Attacks American Aid to the Chinese Government

Reuters, Tokyo, 1st: When a government spokesperson met with foreign visitors this morning, he was asked about a reporter's claim that the United States intended to "encircle" Japan by distributing aircraft in the Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Malaya, Burma, and China. The spokesperson replied that he believed that the United States was indeed preparing in the South Pacific, and that he believed the news of the concentration of American aircraft was credible. However, "I believe that the Japanese government has asked the American government." He went on to say about the Soviet-German war that Japan may officially announce its attitude in two or three days. People from several circles here believe that this statement may be announced tomorrow. Deputy spokesperson of the Information Bureau Ishii said that the new aid from the United States to Chongqing, including 100 combat aircraft and active-duty pilots, does not show a friendly attitude towards Japan. Japan is now observing the attitude of the United States with great attention. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" commented today that the recent trip of Brigadier General Clagett to Chongqing is evidence of the recent American hostility towards Japan. The newspaper urged Japan to take effective action quickly to prevent the United States from using Chongqing as the first line of defense against Japan. The newspaper also claimed that the purpose of Clagett's trip was twofold: (1) to rebuild the air force in Chongqing; (2) to establish an American Chongqing alliance with the direct purpose of attacking Japan. In view of the current superiority of the Japanese air force and the greater needs of Britain, the success of the American effort to rebuild the Chongqing air force is doubtful, but Japan should take strict measures against all American attempts to aid Chongqing. The newspaper continued that the reason why the United States is avoiding making relations with Japan worse is because it wants to provide the most effective assistance to Britain. If the United States maintains this attitude, it will be absolutely impossible to achieve true peace between the United States and Japan. American aid to Chongqing only increases and prolongs the suffering of the Chinese people. The United States should re-examine the situation in the Far East from a broad perspective of establishing lasting peace in the Pacific. The "China and Foreign Commerce News" also issued a warning, saying that Britain and the United States continue to aid Chongqing, not because they want to save Chongqing, but because they want to exhaust Japan.

### U.S. Navy Secretary Gives Speech Urging America to Seize the Opportunity to Strike Germany, Asserting that the Soviet Union Can Resist German Forces, and that the European War Has Reached a Decisive Stage

Boston, 30th (Havas Agency) - Navy Secretary Knox delivered a speech at the 33rd annual meeting of state governors in Boston today, stating that the European war has reached a crucial stage where victory or defeat will be determined. The Soviet Union will certainly be able to resist German forces during these critical months. Now is the time for our country to unleash its naval power and eliminate the German threat in the Atlantic. Since Hitler began his war against the world, we have been given a heaven-sent opportunity to influence the overall global situation and the future. The great military preparations we have made should now be put to use. We will surely defeat the forces of evil and ensure the victory of Christian civilization. Such a great undertaking is inherently dangerous. The tonnage of ships sunk in the first five months of this year totaled 2,193,000 tons. In other words, for every ship that Britain and America manage to build, three are sunk, and these ships are carrying planes, tanks, and other military supplies. If this ratio continues, Hitler will win and dominate the world. Therefore, we must quickly catch up and shatter Hitler's dreams.

Washington, 1st (Reuters) - The "Outlook" magazine published today carries an article by Navy Secretary Knox, stating that Hitler is becoming increasingly alarmed by the growing strength of the American people's resolve. He fears that Americans will move from a passive to an active stance against him. Hitler is not certain of winning through violence, so he is proposing a dishonorable peace to deceive the brave British and to divide the people of Britain and America. This is to disrupt cooperation that could force Germany to surrender. Accepting this peace proposal would allow Hitler to attack an unassisted Britain and America again. The cunning Hitler seeks to win through trickery, offering a tempting but poisonous sweetness, which is more dangerous than his threats and roars. If the British are certain that America will support them, they will not listen to this proposal. Therefore, Americans should make the British aware that American aid is extremely reliable. Americans are now prepared to join the war if necessary, knowing that Britain must not be defeated and willing to let its leaders choose the best way to defeat Hitler.

### America to Establish More Naval Bases

Washington, 1st (Reuters) - Navy Secretary Knox announced yesterday that the United States will establish three additional naval bases: one on Midway Island in the central Pacific, to be established on August 1st; one on Unalaska Island in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, to be established on September 1st; and one in Gaulnas Bay, Trinidad, in the Caribbean, to be established on August 1st.

### Konoe Broadcasts to the Japanese People

Tokyo, 2nd (United Press) - Japanese Prime Minister Konoe broadcast to the public, urging the Japanese people to prepare for any necessities in the China war. He said that Japan should rely on its own strength to build a new order in East Asia. It is widely believed that Konoe's speech is an important statement of the government's diplomatic policy after the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. Konoe also said that he recognizes that the Sino-Japanese war is entering its fifth year, but asked the people to consider Japan's mission before complaining about the government. He added that if the Japanese people can unite strongly, Japan's future will be bright.

### Australia, the Netherlands East Indies, and Malaya Conclude Agreement to Prevent Japanese Advance Southward

New York, 1st (Haitong Agency) - This morning's New York newspapers reported that Australia, the Netherlands East Indies, and British Malaya have concluded an agreement to share naval and air force bases if needed. It is said that the motive for this defense agreement is to counter the Japanese advance southward.

### Shigemitsu Departs Portugal, Flies to America to Return Home

Lisbon, 1st (Haitong Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu, after staying here for more than a week, took a clipper plane to New York yesterday, en route to Japan.

### Soviet Union Reaffirms Maintenance of Friendship with Turkey

Moscow, 1st (TASS) - Hitler's recent accusation that the Soviet Union demanded to occupy the Dardanelles and other straits has been proven false. Recently, Radio Rome claimed that the Soviet ambassador to Britain, in a meeting with Eden, demanded that he put pressure on Turkey to cede the straits to the Soviet Union. This rumor is no different from Hitler's fabrication; every word is a lie. The Soviet Union has never planned to infringe upon Turkish sovereignty. Facts before the war can prove that the Soviet Union absolutely assisted Turkey in maintaining its sovereignty. Whether in the past, present, or future, the Soviet Union is indeed Turkey's most loyal friend.

### Soviet Union Denies Air Raid on Bulgaria

Moscow, 1st (TASS) - The Swedish Reuter Information Bureau, a German propaganda organ in Scandinavia, recently falsely claimed that "Soviet planes bombed Bulgarian cities." This report is purely fabricated. Soviet planes have never flown over Bulgarian territory.

### American Medical Association Sends Representatives to Chongqing to Aid China, Work Becomes More Active, Five Million U.S. Dollars Largely Raised, Battlefield Hospital Group Will Come to China to Serve

The American Bureau for Medical Aid to China has been established in the United States since September 1937, and it has been four years since. The cash and medical supplies raised have reached 800,000 U.S. dollars. The United China Relief will donate 5 million U.S. dollars this year, with the Association undertaking 1.6 million U.S. dollars. The staff from 1941 to 1942 has all been selected, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek has been invited to remotely lead the honorary chairman position. In order to facilitate liaison with all aspects of China, the Association has specially dispatched Mr. Zheng Baonan as the representative to China. Mr. Zheng has flown from the United States to Chongqing in early June, and now has an office in the new school transport model area to actively carry out work.

Enthusiastic contributions from all over the United States

According to the Chairman of the United China Relief, Mr. White Lunsuo, the 5 million yuan aid China fundraising movement has been remarkable since it began. There have been two recent large donations, one for 500 U.S. dollars from an anonymous person in New York, and one for 20,000 U.S. dollars at one time from a celebrity in Pennsylvania. Both of them do not want to publish their names. In addition, 214 branches across the country held street fundraising movements for three days. After the total is fully collected, the results will be spectacular. The "Life Picture" magazine published on the 23rd of last month contains pictures of the United Committee for the Relief of Chinese Refugees in the United States, with a total of nine pages. The first picture is of the Chinese costume exhibition held in New York in early June, and there are photos of many other British celebrities who are enthusiastic about relieving Chinese refugees.

China needs extensive relief

Mr. Wei Bo of the American Medical Aid to China has been in China for more than a year and has served on the American Red Site Cross Aid China Committee and the China Industrial Cooperative. He has recently returned to the United States via Hong Kong, or will come to China again. According to reports, although aid medicines are shipped in steadily, China still needs more assistance, and its importance is very urgent. Mr. Wei also recalled the process of transporting a large batch of medicines with the British YMCA Association Goldins in September and October last year, and crossing into China. Because the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was destroyed and transportation was difficult, some of the church staff in charge of rushing the transport were tired and ill and died. Mr. Wei also said that he was very interested in this trip, and he was particularly satisfied with the work he saw in resettling exiles, saving the wounded, and helping the poor. When Mr. Wei passed through Guiyang, he visited Dr. Lin Sheng, the captain of the Chinese Red Cross Relief Corps, and expressed his admiration for the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement.

Battlefield hospitals come to China to serve

After Mr. Wei Bo returned to the United States, his vacancy was succeeded by Mr. Zheng Binnan, the newly appointed representative to China from the United China Relief. Now Mr. Zheng is responsible for taking care of the affairs of the US Battlefield Hospital Group coming to China to serve. The American organization of the Anglo-American-Canadian Joint Battlefield Hospital Group affiliated to the China Aid Association has already taken a ship from Los Angeles to Yangon and then to Free China. The group is led by Mr. Kruia, a former missionary in China, and carries 10 battlefield ambulances, two cargo trucks, a mobile machine shop, and a number of staff vehicles and surgeons. After the group comes to China, it will cooperate with the China Red Cross Battlefield Service Corps to rush to the front lines to engage in the work of rescuing wounded soldiers and relieving refugees. The medicines used by the group will be supplied directly or indirectly by the US Aid China Association, and other groups will also be given considerable assistance.

Disaster relief medicines arrive one after another

According to sources revealed by the Red Cross in this port, the American Red Cross will have a large number of surgical medical supplies, worth 50,000 U.S. dollars, including wheat, quinine, etc., shipped directly from Seattle to China, and there are also 3,000 pounds of milk in glass bottles, a total of 80,000 bottles, clean and hygienic, and nutritious, which is of great benefit to the physiological health of refugee children. The broken rice and wheat transported to China are all packed in white cloth bags, each bag weighing 50 pounds. The bags are painted with the emblem of the American Red Site Cross, etc. These rice and wheat are all crushed with high-quality rice milling equipment, and will never be mixed. The color is white and pure, and even the Chinese country rice is inferior. After these relief supplies arrive in Shanghai, they will be transported to Hong Kong, Free China, and the occupied areas for disaster relief. After that, the relief supplies transported from the United States to China will not be affected by the requisition of the US presidential ship for military use.

Pastor to return to the United States on schedule

Mr. Basde, the President of the Shanghai American Red Cross, has been in Shanghai for more than 30 years. He has been ordered to return to his country, and he will leave Shanghai for the United States on the Pierce Presidential Ship on the 5th of this month. All the public groups in this block have set up banquets to bid farewell to him. The American Overseas Chinese Association will also hold a public banquet at the Country General Assembly at noon today. Mr. Bai is the chairman of Yingmei Tobacco Company, and he has heard that he has a very wide range of contacts in the business community. The lively grand occasion is expected. Thirty years ago, Mr. Bai first came to Shanghai as the first prosecutor of the American Police Inspector's Office, and also served as the deputy commander of the American garrison in Beiping, with the rank of major. After Dr. Baker, the director of the American Red Association's Chinese relief business, left Shanghai, he succeeded as the head of the Red Association in Shanghai. He is enthusiastic about public welfare and is respected by all walks of life. This time, he was ordered to return to his country, and he will retire in Seattle. Before the successor Anderson arrives in Shanghai, his vacancy will be temporarily filled by the deputy director, Carter.

### This year, industrial and commercial enterprises will implement special reserves for withdrawal in order to consolidate the foundation of industry and commerce and prevent the impact of price changes

Due to the recent high prices and the increase in the prices of industrial and commercial assets, the profits obtained from the year-end accounts contain virtual values. If dividends are still distributed according to the usual method, then if prices change in the future, the dividends that have been distributed will not be able to be recovered.

Seriously affects the foundation of industry and commerce, so the Regulations on Special Reserves for Industrial and Commercial Enterprises in Extraordinary Times have been promulgated. The regulations stipulate that when each industrial and commercial enterprise has a surplus at the end of the annual business year, after withdrawing the public accumulation fund in accordance with the law, if the amount of the surplus is more than one-fifth of the total actual capital, 10% of the surplus will be withdrawn, if it is more than one-quarter, 20% of the surplus will be withdrawn, and if it is more than one-third, 30% of the surplus will be withdrawn as special reserves, in addition to being used to make up for unexpected losses, and approved by the Ministry,

Cannot be distributed

This move is purely for the maintenance of industry and commerce and is sufficient to consolidate industrial and commercial credit and encourage investors' interest. Moreover, the regulations stipulate that this special reserve must be specially stored in banks, which is also beneficial to reducing idle funds in the market. In order to implement this special reserve system, all local competent government offices have been notified to instruct their subordinate registered companies to implement it in accordance with the law from this year onwards. The various forms filled in during the settlement shall also be submitted to the competent government office for review by the ministry.

### Belgian Ambassador to stay in Hong Kong, coming to Shanghai within days

The Belgian Ambassador to China, Ji Youmu, went to Chongqing in February this year to visit the central leaders in order to enhance the relationship between China and Belgium. It has been four months since. He originally intended to set off early and return to Beiping. However, when the new Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, Guo Taiqi, arrived in Chongqing, the ambassador took this opportunity to meet with Guo and pay a formal visit, so he stayed a little longer. Now that Mr. Guo has arrived in Chongqing to take office, the ambassador has also completed his mission in Chongqing, so he flew to Hong Kong by plane the day before yesterday, and came to Shanghai for a short break on the way, and then returned to Beiping. Now it is heard that the Belgian Embassy in this port received a telegram from Hong Kong yesterday, saying that after the ambassador arrived, he encountered a hurricane, so he tentatively planned to rest in Hong Kong for a day or two, and then come to Shanghai after the hurricane passed.

### The previous issue of the Miller Review was detained by the Police Department, the article slandered the Japanese army and was confiscated, the newspaper denied the insult and continued to be published

According to the Zilin Newspaper, according to the Allied News Agency, the Police Department of the Ministry of Industry has confiscated the Miller Review weekly published on June 21. It is heard that Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama, the spokesperson for the Japanese Army in this city, visited Major Bao Wen, the chief of the Police Department yesterday (30th), and protested against an article in the Miller Review that slandered the Japanese army, and said that such words were intolerable.

Anti-Japanese text

The incident originated when the American weekly published extreme anti-Japanese texts in a prominent position. The Police Department has recently requested the US Consul General to take appropriate control measures. However, the US Consulate General stated that the weekly was not registered with the US Consulate General. The Police Department cut off and had a confiscation act. It is expected that the American authorities here will take action against Bao Huier, the editor and publisher of the Miller Review, and the American and Japanese authorities have heard that they are consulting and can prevent the disclosure of the same text if necessary.

Formal registration

According to Bao Huier's report to reporters yesterday, he has learned from the Police Department that about 30 copies of the Miller Review weekly have been confiscated by the police. However, Mr. Bao denied that the newspaper was not registered with the US Consul General in Shanghai. According to reports, the weekly has been formally registered in the name of the Miller Publishing Company for 22 years, with only a brief interruption. The Japanese side is obviously feeling resentful of the newspaper's excerpts from the "Times", "Asia Magazine" and "New York Times".

Reason for detention

This article mentions two Japanese "fascists", one is Colonel Hashimoto, who ordered the Japanese planes to bomb the American ship Panan, and the other is Bai Toshiro, the advisor to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There is a mention of the Japanese Emperor in the text, which the Japanese consider an insult. However, the Miller Review side had no intention of insulting it. The Miller Review published on June 28 is now on sale as usual.

### True cholera has been found in this city, three patients, one died

The weather in Shanghai has suddenly turned hot these days. Under the scorching heat of the sun, true cholera has begun to be discovered. According to reports from Datong reporters to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road, Shanghai has discovered a terrifying case of true cholera. There have been three consecutive cases: (1) Xie Aji, 9 years old, female, from Shaoxing, living at Chen Baoli, 11 Xujia Lane, Kangti Road, (2) Wang Ruqing, male, from Ningbo, 38 years old, living at 107 Mabal Road, (5) Shen Chen, female, 29 years old, from Ningbo, living in the back building of Shouchangli, 571 Shaoli River, Huacheng Road. After the above three were put into the hospital, the stool of the three was sent to the Health Department of the Ministry of Industry for inspection and it has been proven to be true cholera. Xie Aji of the three patients has not been able to be treated and died yesterday.

### Street workers scuffled at Jardine Matheson Wharf in the French Concession, unemployed workers attacked in separate routes, the two sides fought like they were facing a formidable enemy, the leader Zhou Ruisheng was seriously injured

Yesterday morning, a labor war broke out at the Jardine Matheson Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, with many people injured and the situation extremely tense. The French police were informed and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western Vietnamese police officers, taking multiple police cars to the scene to suppress the situation. The details of the report by reporters of this newspaper are as follows:

Street small worker

The Jardine Matheson Steamship Company's Bund wharf in the French Concession, south from Xinkai River to the mouth of Fada Road, in addition to docks 1234 and the new Beijing Five wharf, there is another small wharf on the north side of the public pit at the mouth of Xinyongan Street. The Jardine Matheson Company prepares it for berthing barges in order to barge goods to the Pudong wharf, and barge goods from the Pudong warehouse to Puxi for unloading. The small workers at the small wharf have nothing to do with the Jardine Matheson Company. They are street small workers, headed by the nickname Small Shaoxing (heard of the surname Xu, his name is unknown), as the foreman, famous at each wharf.

Unemployed grudge

There is another Zhou Ruisheng, who is a weighing foreman and also works at the small wharf. At the end of autumn last year, I don't know why, he was dismissed from his job by the Jardine Matheson Company, and he lost his job, so he became angry with Small Shaoxing. Zhou recently sought to resume work, but he could not do so. He had no choice but to use the method of chasing deer, a full martial arts move, and it happened.

Five-way attack

Zhou gathered one hundred and fifty to sixty workers in advance, and at about 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, he attacked in five routes by water and land. One route advanced from the Yangjingbang in the British Concession, one route rushed from Xinyongan Street, one route went from the Chinese border through the Kaihe Iron Gate to the Concession to the small wharf, one route advanced north from the Roosevelt Wharf, and another route hired a boat from the Huangpu River by water.

Both sides scuffled

The plan was not secret and Small Shaoxing learned of it in advance, and also gathered more than one hundred workers to wait for the battle. At about 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, they saw workers with white cloths wrapped around their arms coming to the small wharf. They beat the workers when they saw them, and one side fought back. The two sides started fighting, and each used iron bars, iron hooks, and other weapons as fighting tools. The situation was tense, and all the Jardine Matheson wharfs were in chaos.

Police car suppression

The wharf patrolmen and nearby patrolmen were also unable to control the situation, so they quickly called the police station to report. After the French police station received the report, they immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western Vietnamese detectives and multiple police cars to rush to the scene of the incident to suppress the situation. The attacking workers fled when they saw the detectives arriving at the scene. More than 20 people were arrested on the spot. Later, dozens of attacking workers who had fled were arrested in the lane of Tonganli, Xinyongan Street, and were taken on a car and sent to the Mai Lan police station for further investigation.

Two routes did not arrive

Although Zhou Fang divided into five routes to attack, two routes of workers failed to arrive temporarily. Among them, from the South Market through the Xinkai River Iron Gate into the French Concession, the Chinese-Vietnamese police guarding the Iron Gate saw a large number of workers with white cloths wrapped around their arms, fearing that they would plot to disobey, and prevented them from entering the Concession and closed the Iron Gate. The workers on the road could not reach their destination. The other route was from Yangjingbang in the Public Concession to the French Concession to the small wharf. It happened that there was a fire in a warehouse near Yangjingbang in the French Concession yesterday morning. The British and French concessions of Yangjingbang were adjacent to each other and arranged iron wire nets to cut off traffic, so the workers on the road could not move forward.

Leader seriously injured

Therefore, Zhou Fang's strength was reduced. Zhou was afraid of suffering a loss in front of him, and he ran away among the crowd. When he was spotted by the workers on Small Shaoxing's side, they went forward to hold Zhou and were surrounded and beaten by several workers, causing serious injuries to his head, waist, and other parts. He was later sent to the hospital by ambulance. It was heard that after the doctor's examination, the right waist was damaged and his life was in danger. In this battle, about two to three hundred workers participated in the scuffle. About three to four people were seriously injured, about twenty people were slightly injured, and a total of more than ninety people were arrested. After the incident, reporters went to the Jardine Matheson Company to inquire, and a certain employee reported that the company would absolutely not give advice on the brawl between street workers this morning (i.e. yesterday morning), because the worker foreman at the small wharf was never hired by the company, so it had nothing to do with the company.

### Various circles are preparing for the anniversary of "July 7th"

The fourth anniversary of the "July 7th" Lugou Bridge Incident will arrive in a blink of an eye. The people of all circles in this city have decided to commemorate this sacred anti-construction festival in spirit because of the special environment of Shanghai. They will not engage in extravagance. The two police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, in order to ensure the general security and good order within the boundary, in addition to stipulating that joint defense precautions will be implemented on that day, will also prohibit all illegal gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities from today, and strictly enforce the curfew laws. During this period, more detectives will be assigned to engage in surveillance in public places, and patrolmen will be dispatched to inspect pedestrians and vehicles on the roads, and border defenses will be tightened to ensure safety.

### The original weight of the Pingmi rice bag has increased, and the wholesale price has also increased

According to the person in charge, Dagong News Agency reporter, the average weight of the Ministry of Industry's foreign rice that recently arrived in Shanghai has increased by about ten pounds. The previous weight was about two hundred and twenty-four pounds per bag, but now it is about two hundred and thirty-four pounds. Therefore, the wholesale price sold to each rice shop was originally 133 yuan and 5 jiao, but now it has been changed to 139 yuan and 5 jiao, an increase of six yuan per bag. However, the change in this wholesale price has nothing to do with the door-to-door price of each rice shop. Each stone is still

One hundred and ten yuan. Also, the mark (symbol) on the bag of foreign rice that arrived in Shanghai before was the three characters HKG, but now it is different, which caused misunderstandings among the rice shops and food households. According to an employee of Xiangmao Bank yesterday, the foreign rice that has recently arrived in Shanghai has multiple marks, so each rice shop and food household only need to pay attention to whether the quality of what they purchased is consistent with the Ministry of Industry.

Same as foreign rice. Also, it was reported that the Glen ship carrying the first batch of public warehouse rice from the Ministry of Industry to Shanghai was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, but it was reported that a hurricane occurred in the sea near Hong Kong, so the date was postponed. As of yesterday, China Wheel Shipping Company, which manages the ship, had not received a telegram from the ship confirming the date. It is likely that it will arrive in about five days. It was also heard that yesterday's newspaper reported that Xue Genghua and Zou Chengding, the two gentlemen of the Political Department of the French Police Department, were in charge of the French Concession.

Gongmi rice evaluation. The news of the matter is absolutely inaccurate, because the order has never been received. As for the sale of Gongmi rice, it is not handled by the police station. The police station is only responsible for supervising the rice price and inspecting the measuring instruments in the rice shop, and some rice merchants have been reported and punished.

They then drove the chauffeur down and jumped into Xu's car, attempting to kidnap Xu. Unexpectedly, the bandit driving was unfamiliar with the car's mechanical components and was unable to start it. The bandits then dragged Xu out, forced him into a white-plated taxi with the number 17740, and sped west, kidnapping him.

Bandits Seize Car It was later learned that the white-plated taxi had been pre-rented by the bandits from the Xiangtai Car Company at No. 566 Weihaiwei Road. They falsely claimed that a patient needed a ride to the doctor's office, so they instructed the company to drive the car to the vicinity of South Bridge Street on Jiaozhou Road at 9:50 AM yesterday morning to wait. The Xiangtai Car Company received the call and sent driver Cai Asi to drive car number 17740 to the address. Unexpectedly, upon arriving at the location, Cai was driven down by the bandits with guns, who then drove the car away. Unexpectedly, they were using it to kidnap Xu Liangdong. The car seized from the Xiangtai Car Company was found near Fuxu Road and Tongfu Road at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The police notified the company to send someone to retrieve it and ordered them to strictly investigate the bandits' whereabouts and rescue Xu Liangdong.

### Mr. Jia Ziyi's Art Exhibition

Mr. Jia Ziyi, a native of Shanyin, resides in this country. He is skilled in literature and painting, and proficient in flowers, birds, and landscapes. In the early years of the Republic of China, he taught at Jingkou Runzhou Middle School. At that time, Western painting was in vogue in our country, sweeping the nation. School art courses were all about watercolor, pencil, and oil painting, and the old essence of Chinese painting was almost excluded. However, Mr. Jia still devoted himself to Chinese painting in his spare time, never following the trend. Many of the principals and teachers of Runzhou Middle School were American. Seeing Mr. Jia paint, they were amazed by his talent. During the war, Mr. Jia experienced the joys and sorrows of family and friends, and the strange sights he witnessed on the road, all of which were expressed in his brush and ink, and he became even more immersed in painting, with even greater enthusiasm than before. He has now collected new and old masterpieces and will hold an exhibition in the painting hall of the Daxin Company from June 30th to July 6th.

### Notes on Viewing Paintings in the Summer

— Midnight

In recent years, art exhibitions have become popular in Shanghai. There are several public exhibitions every day, leaving people overwhelmed. As an amateur, I often visit them when I have nothing to do. The Daxin Painting Hall and the Ningbo Tongxiang Association are places where I often go. However, I neither claim to be refined nor have the financial ability to buy the paintings to decorate my humble abode. My purpose is simply to look at them. However, the more I see, the more I feel that the realm of art is profound and unfathomable. A masterpiece is definitely not something that a vulgar person can achieve by splashing ink. It requires a combination of talent, cultivation, and effort, and none of them can be lacking.

An amateur talking about painting is nothing more than making wild guesses. For example, the peonies by Yun Nantian, each of which is priced at six thousand yuan, are certainly masterpieces. The landscapes by modern painters such as Wu Hufan, Feng Chaoran, and Wu Daichiu, each of which is priced at five or six hundred yuan, are also certainly masterpieces. However, I often see a painting that I personally find satisfying, but the painter's name is rarely heard, and his price is often very cheap. Perhaps this is because my appreciation is not good enough. Looking at paintings is like looking at literary works. Everyone has their own individual preferences. Therefore, the works of renowned painters are certainly good, but not every piece is a masterpiece. The works of unknown writers are also not necessarily all bad. When I look at paintings, I just look at the paintings and don't pay attention to whether the author of the painting is famous. We see a large pearl in a jewelry store and do not think it is unusual. But discovering a small pearl in the gravel is very surprising and precious.

The summer calligraphy and painting exhibition opened yesterday in the hall on the sixth floor of the Pudong Tongxiang Association. There are fifty or sixty exhibitors, with four or five hundred pieces in total. I braved the summer heat to visit for an hour at 3:00 PM. It was truly a dazzling display. There were works by famous artists and works by emerging unknown artists. Among these hundreds of works, I found several ink landscape paintings that I was satisfied with, which were the works of Mr. Zhang Shutong from Songjiang.

Mr. Shutong was originally a famous calligrapher. Because he is a calligrapher, his light ink landscape paintings have a unique style. Of the six principles of painting, the most important is spirit resonance. Mr. Shutong's paintings are lofty, vigorous, and uniquely expressive. His brushstrokes are calm, unparalleled in the world. Mr. Shutong is good at calligraphy, and the six principles are applicable to the eight principles of calligraphy. The paintings of Confucian scholars are different from the paintings of painters. The spirit roams with heaven, without the slightest hint of worldliness. Mr. Tang Dingzhi praised Mr. Shutong's paintings, saying, "The spirit resonance is exceptionally transcendent. I have not seen such paintings for a long time." Mr. Feng Chaoran once said of Mr. Shutong's paintings, "The spirit travels with him. The soul of the painter has been captured by you."

However, Mr. Shutong has a high moral character and likes leisure. He is not very willing to bury himself in painting. However, if he does paint, every piece is excellent and wonderful. Wen Zhengming said, "If a person's character is not high, there is no way to use ink." This shows that putting down ink is not a trivial matter. One must have nothing in one's heart before the smoke, clouds, and beautiful colors, and the vitality of heaven and earth will naturally be in harmony. Mr. Shutong's paintings are in this state. However, there are very few of Mr. Shutong's works in this exhibition. He had no intention of joining the art exhibition, but just a few paintings are enough to show that Mr. Shutong's paintings are transcendent and extraordinary. If someone who loves calligraphy and painting wants to know how good a certain painting is, a visit to see Mr. Shutong's paintings will not prove to be empty words.

Mr. Chen Taoyi's calligraphy was originally bold and unrestrained, repelling thousands of people, with a sense of being invincible. Recently, he has specialized in writing Zhangcao, changing from strange and unrestrained to rigorous, and from bold and unrestrained to precise. A kind of sharp and piercing aura is sometimes revealed in the thick and condensed ink practice. Other works, such as the calligraphy of Mr. Zeng Gong and Mr. Min Ruizhi, and the paintings of Mr. Shen Maishi, Mr. Tu Yuexin, and Mr. Xia Shenchu, either excel in ancient elegance or in vigor, and are all excellent works. In addition, there are the images of Dharma, Zhong Kui, water buffalo, and the four characters "Filial Piety, Brotherly Love, Loyalty, and Forgiveness" painted by the immortal wood Taoist on the planchette (with a postscript by Mr. Shen Enfu), which are very unique, and viewers are full of praise.

### Banks are Planning to Reduce Interest Rates Again; While Interest on Demand Deposits Has Already Been Reduced, This Time They are Considering Reducing Interest on Time Deposits; It is Said That They Will Charge Fees for Checks, Truly Calculating Every Penny; If There is Truly an Abundance of Idle Funds, Why Not Use Them for Useful Purposes?

Due to the abundance of idle funds in this city, banks implemented a reduction in interest rates on demand deposits last year. Recently, due to the increasing abundance of idle funds, the surge in floating deposits, and the difficulty in using them, banks have uniformly cancelled the previous preferential interest rate methods for depositors (i.e., interest rate increases) starting this term. They have also decided to reduce the interest rate on time deposits by one or half a percentage point. At the same time, the banks' clearing reserve will, starting this term, only pay interest on clearing deposits of clearing banks according to the limit. Clearing deposits of non-clearing banks and firms (i.e., interbank clearing deposits) will not be paid interest. Some banks, due to the rising costs of paper and printing, and the increasing use of checks in society, plan to imitate the methods of HSBC and Standard Chartered Banks and charge a small fee for checks. Customers will be charged one dime for each check used, which will be deducted from their deposit account at the time of use. It can truly be said that they are calculating every penny.

Previously, in order to facilitate depositors and attract deposits, Chinese banks were open for half a day on Sundays. Now, they are closing on Saturday afternoons, reducing their working hours by one day each week, which is inconvenient for all industries. In October of last year, due to the abundance of idle funds, the interest rate on demand deposits was reduced, reducing depositors' income. Recently, they will reduce the interest rate on time deposits, which will significantly impact those who rely on interest income to maintain their livelihoods. On one hand, Kong Fanshi (H. H. Kung) became arrogant when people deposited, which is very different from the past, when people were afraid that deposits would not come and tried every means to attract them. Comparing the past and the present, there is a world of difference. If banks are truly suffering from too many deposits and an abundance of idle funds, why not transfer them to areas that are beneficial to China's future? This would fulfill the banks' responsibility to facilitate the public, benefit society, and support the country. Internally, they should reduce or save unnecessary expenses. During times of national crisis, prices have soared, but they still want to maintain their usual leisurely enjoyment. Considering the principles of heaven and human feelings, how considerate they are to themselves, and how heavily they exploit depositors, even charging for using a check. The banking industry can truly be said to be "looking at money through Western glasses." Moreover, the problem of interest rate reduction is not limited to this. After a decision is made to reduce the interest rate on demand deposits, the speculation trend will be strong. Now, reducing the interest rate on time deposits will further indirectly encourage speculation and hoarding, causing prices to rise and people's lives to become more difficult. Who knows if this will be a catalyst for further hardship? It will also cause the public to lose interest in savings and lead to waste. The resulting disaster cannot be fully described in a few words. (Shou Jun)

### Bank Remittance Interest Rate: 1.5 Yuan per Thousand Yuan

The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee has set the interbank remittance interest rate for June at 1.5 yuan per thousand yuan (i.e., a monthly interest rate of 1.5%), a reduction of 0.5 yuan compared to May.

### Million Bags of Foreign Flour Stored in Shanghai

The foreign flour market yesterday was particularly quiet, due to the banks closing for the half-year settlement period from July 1st to 2nd. Most markets were closed. However, the Grain Merchants Association, following summer hours, only conducted half-day trading and did not suspend operations. Nevertheless, trading was exceptionally slow due to the bank holiday. The continuous supply from Hong Kong has dampened spirits, with no excitement amid concerns about rice and oil. Trading in Golden Dragon flour was minimal, with only the local street vendors purchasing about one thousand bags of Fortress Brand flour at $33 and Fortune God Brand flour at $31.70. The market remains stagnant. The Chinese factories continued their discounted flour sales yesterday, which was the last day. These sales will cease today. It is estimated that current stocks of various foreign flour brands total over one million bags, so there is no immediate concern of shortages. The discounted sales event has concluded.

### Corn Prices Surge by One Dollar, Cake Sales Slightly Increase

Yesterday, corn sales were brisk, with purchases from both the Yanqing and inland regions. Local demand was also strong, boosting market sentiment and causing prices to surge by one dollar. Approximately 1,800 bags of Saigon aged corn were sold at $27 to $27.80, over 1,000 bags of Dutch white corn at $26.50 to $28.40, and 500 bags of yellow corn at $28.20 to $29. Jardine Matheson sold 25 tons at $51. Approximately 1,400 bags of foreign corn will be loaded onto the Taikoo Company's new Peking ship today, bound for Weihaiwei.

Bean cake sales have recently shown slight improvement, gradually shifting market sentiment from fatigue to firmness. Yesterday, 2,000 pieces of Kaiyuanji and Lu Brand bean cake were sold at $16.20, 3,000 pieces of Dayou bean cake at $15.90 to $16, and 3,000 pieces of Xingji spot bean cake at $16.40 to $16.70. Additionally, 20,000 pieces of futures were sold at $17.20 to $17.40, an increase of twenty to thirty cents compared to previous prices.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Tighten

The sugar market remained tight yesterday, with prices continuing to rise. The association's quotations show spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar at $91.57 for June arrivals in outside warehouses, up seven cents. May imports rose by one dollar to $90.067 to $91. April imports rose by nine cents to $89.79. March imports rose by the same amount to $89.4. KD Brand Dutch red sugar was at $73, up five cents. NT Brand was at $70, $70.05, $71, up one and a half dollars. Taikoo Granulated White B Brand was at $106.8 in Eastern warehouses and $107.23 in Western warehouses, up eight cents. DY Brand was at $98.5 in Eastern warehouses, up one and a half dollars. HX Brand was at $89.58, up three cents. H Brand cart red sugar was at $68.5, up one dollar. Bagged sugar was at $69.8.

### New Xuzhou Vegetables Remain Highly Priced

The new gold vegetables from the Xuzhou production area have been on the market for several days. Given the large volume, prices should have been lower, but a certain firm has ignored the risks and continued to push prices up, creating a new record for production prices, reaching as high as $20. Adding in exchange rates, the price in Shanghai would have to rise to $40.

### Cotton Markets Fall in the United States and India

The New York cotton market was volatile. Prices initially rose due to buying by dealers, but then fell due to reduced sales by Southern dealers and sluggish cotton cloth trade. The market closed down five to ten points. Indian cotton also fell by five to twelve rupees.

### Cigarette Hoarders Make a Comeback

The cigarette industry saw stable prices in the first half of the year. After the "red opening," various aspects showed a flourishing trend. Large and small hoarders accumulated goods, mortgaging them to banks. Warehouse companies were overwhelmed. The hoarding trend was evident, with expectations of guaranteed profits. However, reality proved otherwise. Since May, prices have stagnated due to Japanese control in various regions, prohibiting exports. Shipping to inland areas was unprofitable. Furthermore, goods sold in one county could not be sold in another, causing inland purchase prices to decline and sales channels to narrow, relying solely on local street sales. As the weather entered the mold season, hoarders became increasingly panicked and rushed to sell, causing prices to plummet. They had to reluctantly cut their losses, covering warehouse rent, interest, and insurance costs, truly a case of "trying to steal a chicken and losing the rice." Recently, with banks reducing deposit interest rates, the hoarding trend has returned. They are once again spreading rumors of increased unified taxes, artificially raising prices. For example, British American Tobacco brand cigarettes were priced at $1,296 per case in May, gradually rising to a high of $1,660 in June. Currently, purchase prices have fallen back to $1,580. The actual increase in the so-called unified tax remains uncertain.

### Economic Musings

— Feng Liu

Economics (III)

The so-called loyalty and integrity are qualities, a grand vision is temperament, profound knowledge is scholarship, and insight into domestic and foreign affairs is talent. Therefore, the special examinations should focus on the latter two, which is the selection of so-called economic talents. In July of the same year, the imperial edict for selecting talents through policy essays stated:

"Based on the Four Books and Five Classics, delve into economics, strongly avoid superficiality, understand principles, and apply them practically, to be fully prepared for service."

The phrase "understand principles and apply them practically, to be fully prepared for service" is a gloss on the phrase "delve into economics." Although Japanese students returning from Japan had brought the term "economics" back to China, it had not yet permeated academic circles, let alone the scholar-official class. At that time, the nation was in peril, and promoting economic talents to address the urgent difficulties was a pressing matter. The need for economic talents is not only seen today but also in the past. For example, the History of the Tang Dynasty states that the censor-in-chief Yuwen Rong recommended Wei Heng, the son of Chancellor Wei Sili, for his economic talents, offering to cede his position to him, and he was promoted to attendant censor. Similarly, Liang Tingnan's "Record of the Barbarian Menace" (referring to the Opium War during the Daoguang era) states that Guangdong censor Su Tingkui studied economics and paid close attention to current affairs. All of these provide an accurate interpretation of the term "economics," far exceeding the scope of the term "economics" as it is understood today. (To be continued)

### Starting with "Suicide"

— Xu Daming

Don't be a slave to romance, be a warrior of the greater society

On the 28th of last month, the newspaper reported:

"Zhu Ming, a student at Jiaotong University from Wuxi, … was very friendly with Li Liangzhi, a fellow townsman (16 years old) from Nanyang Model Girls' School. They soon fell in love and secretly vowed to be together forever. However, due to environmental obstacles, their wishes could not be fulfilled. Zhu suddenly had the idea of a 'pair of lovebirds dying together' and took poison together yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m."

This is just one "example," but there are definitely more than just this "pair of lovebirds" who took poison and committed suicide because their "love" was not successful.

Therefore, we cannot but point out the crux of this problem. We are all the same age, and we have a shared responsibility to alleviate this pain and to share what we know with other young friends in order to stem the tide of "suicide." Because today, there are still many people who are gradually walking the path of suicide because of "heartbreak" or being restricted from the freedom to marry.

Obviously, it is very easy for us to state the principle of discussing this problem, which is a very abstract sentence: "This is a product of feudal society."

Therefore, today, we should first solve the current problems: how to cope with unreasonable oppression in the family? How to fight for the freedom of love and reasonable marriage? And what kind of guidance methods should teachers adopt on issues such as marriage and love between students? These are more personal problems.

We all know that most of our parents or elders all come from the old society. They have already been influenced by the things of the old society and have developed stubborn and unchanging conservative ideas. They believe that today's free love is related to face or hurts the "family." Due to this deeply ingrained concept, they have lumped the "sins" of current phenomena such as "divorce" and "cancellation of engagement" together with "free love." But in fact, it is quite the opposite. The reason why there are so many "divorces" and "cancellations" today is precisely because the old does not allow the new freedom and development on a reasonable path, causing the necessary shocks. And we undoubtedly sympathize with the new and progressive side, because the times are advancing, and people have to keep up. Otherwise, they will be eliminated for being backward.

But when friends deal with this problem, they should first understand what kind of people their parents are? You can't completely see your parents as the same people as you, because we ourselves are influenced by the new era consciousness, and obviously, we will have different ideas from our parents. However, we can use the weakness of parents' deep love for their children, first explain the reasons to our parents and win the victory in persuasion. In any case, there is no reason to take the "suicide" route, because you yourself already understand that this is a dispute between two eras, the new and the old.

Therefore, we say that our own freedom of love and freedom of marriage still needs to be fought for, but we must first understand today's era and what the true meaning of love is? This means that we have to put in the effort to deepen our own cultivation and understanding. And if you only know how to talk about love and romance, then that is definitely not the true meaning of love, but rather becoming a puppet of love; this is not "free love," but a completely distorted kind of vent. People who learn some Western superficialities of love like this, but do not understand the true meaning of love, frankly speaking, we say that they are undesirable! But pointing young people to the path of light, jumping out of the fire pit of "suicide," parents certainly need to take responsibility, but people who are teachers should bear greater responsibility!

But, it must be noted that I am not encouraging young students to throw away their books and jump into the circle of "love" together, but rather saying that love itself is not a bad thing, but rather needs to be understood by young people with the correct methods and guidance.

For example, because of the relationship of love, the intensification of subject research, and the mutual pursuit of common interests and understanding, and the increase in love, this is the correct direction, and the foundation of love is even stronger. And there are many people in the world who have completed very great works during the period of love, and there are many people who have done so, the problem lies in the proper guidance and their own understanding.

(Editor's note) We are certainly not "lovers to the death" to deny everything, but at this time and place, emphasizing the "own" love problem is not enough "life." Recently, a group of young people are accustomed to "emotional entanglement" and "suicide," I finally feel that they are a little "dizzy," as if this is still the most worthwhile thing to do; apart from stupid, speculative young masters and ladies as a compulsory course, there is really no reason to come to "elect" one or two, as an embellishment in the history of life.

10 The Heart of a Loving Father

"I love her, I don't want her to suffer for me, to be ridiculed for me!" Almost every night, after Mei Bao fell asleep, he would face a dim oil lamp alone, saying this empty-handedly: "She should live a happier life than me. She has suffered enough in the past few years. Let her go back and enjoy some happiness! She has a father and brother, they will definitely treat her better than me..."

Under this state of mind, Qiu Haitang moved out of the Li family village like he was running away, and he had already decided not to let Luo Xiangqi see him again.

Ding… Ding… Ding…

Behind a grove of trees, a clear bell suddenly rang.

"Ah! Let's go! They're finished." He hurriedly quickened his pace with his two wet, muddy legs, took a turn, and ran along a small path.

This is the Seventh Elementary School established by the Hengshui County Government. Although there were only six or seven not very new bungalows and just over a hundred students, in Qiu Haitang's mind, it was already a paradise on earth. He hoped that his daughter could be well educated in this paradise and become a happy girl.

"Huh! What's going on? Everyone's gone?" As soon as he stepped into the school gate, he saw that the playground was empty and there wasn't even half a person. He felt very puzzled and thought to himself that he was too late and the students had already left.

It wasn't until he asked the school worker who he met every day that he learned that the reality was exactly the opposite of what he thought.

"You're too early. There's still one class left!"

He couldn't help but smile reassuringly, put away his umbrella, and walked to stand under a long corridor.

"The next room is the fifth and sixth grade classes. Your daughter is in class in there. You're welcome to go and take a look!" The school worker said to him very enthusiastically. (147)

Self Confession

### A Record of Substituting for an Exam

— San San

Please see that today's students are actually future experts

The school had just finished exams when Zhao, who was several years older than me and also my elder, came to my house. He was going to take the entrance exam for the Provincial ×× Middle School and insisted that I go with him.

On a small blackboard at the school, I found Zhao's name and seat on the form. Zhao pointed to a name next to him and said, "This person has never come – probably has some 'connections' and it's been arranged – you can sit in his seat later, anyway, they don't check the exam card. If they ask you, just say you forgot to bring it. You just need to remember this person's name and number... we're taking math today!" I thought I had already learned the math that Zhao was testing on, and I did well at it at the time, so it shouldn't be too difficult now, just consider it a review! So I obeyed him, not thinking for a moment that this was a big mistake.

I walked into the classroom with Zhao very calmly. The other test takers looked at me with surprise, because they had never seen me in the few courses they had taken. The proctor didn't notice either. They really didn't check the exam card. I felt like I was taking my own coursework a few hours ago, not nervous at all, and started working on the test paper as soon as I got it. Suddenly, the proctor asked Zhao to move to another desk on the other side, because there were too many empty seats. In this way, Zhao's plan to peek at me, who was impersonating his classmate, was unsuccessful. I just continued to do it myself, and later wrote Zhao's name and number and handed it in first. After a long time, Zhao also came out with a test paper that I don't know what he wrote on. Finally, this fraudulent "exam substitution" was unintentionally created.

A few days later, Zhao happily told me that he had been admitted.

It's been a year, and Zhao is gone, leaving me with this crime of the past year. Now I repent and confess, and I hope the school authorities will pay attention to it. It's recruitment season again!

### Today's "Green Gem"

— Yuanshen

The Green Gem Theater occupies a very important position in Shanghai's drama scene today. Although their standards are not as high as those of the "China Traveling Troupe" and the "Shanghai Art Theater," their sound organization, well-rounded cast, and grand performance effects are undeniable facts. They boast an audience of all social classes, which is something to be proud of.

Here, I will talk about the current dynamics of Green Gem.

The leader of Green Gem is Chen Qiufeng, who has more than ten years of experience in the drama circle. Their lineup of writers and directors is quite strong, including Gu Menghu, Zhang Xunzi, Zhao Yanshi, and Liu Yixin.

Gu Menghu is a playwright and also a filmmaker. Ten years ago, he served as an actor in the Southern China Society led by Tian Han, mixing with Hong Shen, Tang Huaiqiu, and others. Later, the Southern China Society disbanded, and the members dispersed everywhere. Tang Huaiqiu then built his own troupe, which is now the "China Traveling Troupe." Gu Menghu first served in the film industry, and then transferred to Green Gem.

Zhang Xunzi is a novelist, but his family is full of "playwright" vibes. His son can write, his daughter can write, and he himself can of course write. He specializes in writing and directing comedies, which are light and humorous in content, but serious and astute in intention.

Zhao Yanshi was a pillar of the Spring Willow Society, which had a large audience when new dramas were popular in the early Republic of China. He has studied Chinese and foreign dramas extensively, and used to perform with Ouyang Yuqian. He specializes in playing the roles of young men.

Liu Yixin is a learned and versatile archaeologist. The "Empress Dowager Cixi and Empress Dowager Longyu," which has been performed at Green Gem these days, is his carefully crafted masterpiece.

Among the actors in the Green Gem cast, some transferred from the "China Traveling Troupe," such as Gu Han, Lan Qing, and Shen Ling. Gu Han and Lan Qing have high acting skills. Especially Lan Qing, who plays rough-lined characters, is exactly like Tang Ruoqing of the "China Traveling Troupe." Shen Ling specializes in playing old men, but he himself is a young man in his twenties. It is said that he has the most experience in playing old men. He usually pays attention to the actions of those old men on the road and in the trams. He even studies the skin of old men, so he can make up very realistically.

Today's Green Gem is moving towards a bright future. They use in-depth and simple methods to grab a large audience and spread the correct consciousness. This is something we should highly respect.

### Prelude to the Release of New United Nations Films

— Yi Zhi

Charlie Chan Cracks the Case of the Invisible Thief. Xu Xinfu directed the famous detective film. The Charlie Chan of the Oriental film industry is brought to the screen, with a vivid and solemn face. The film is full of mystery and twists and turns as he cracks the case of the invisible thief. Most worth introducing is Gong Qiuxia (playing Miss Qian)'s beautiful performance in Charlie Chan's inner room feast. The natural revelation, drinking, and singing will be trialed at the New Light Theater.

Where Does the Soul Return? It has been fully completed since filming began two months ago. In the last few intense sound segments, director Li Pingqian cleverly moved and renamed "Where Does the Soul Return?" to "Separation of Life and Death," using deep brushstrokes to sketch the psychology of young people, especially the scars of war, giving them or her trauma, a very stimulating film, which will be released at the Shanghai Light Theater after Wild Roses.

Battlefield Lovebirds is Yang Xiaozhong's grand fashion film after "Zombie Revenge." Liu Yu and Wang Xichun co-star, telling the story of a happy small family, nurturing the happy life of a newlywed couple, due to the cloud of war, the good times are not long, and the business also fails, once again falling into the abyss. Later, they wake up and do great and moving work in the interior. The entire film was completed in mid-July, and the release location is undecided.

Silver Gun Bandit is a martial arts blockbuster. Fang Peilin's writing and direction is his second resounding shot after "Yanmen Pass." Zhang Huichong and Xu Liang, well-known martial arts stars from north and south, take the lead roles, writing about the process of a powerful detective going deep into the bandit's lair. He co-stars with Xu Liang, jumping from a high building, running in the middle of a mountain, confronting each other, fighting bravely, and tracking desperately, with many dangerous and tense shots active on the screen. There is hope of success in early July, I heard.

### Blood Rain in the Jade Garden

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 12: As Helpless as Ning Wu

The capture of Daizhou was due to the cunning plan of the bandits being successful, because Li Zicheng was unable to capture the city and lost many men and horses, and was of course very annoyed. In fact, he had captured several state cities before too easily, and now that he had hit a wall here, how could he give up? He was determined to capture Daizhou to maintain his prestige. After discussing with his military advisor Niu Jinjian, Niu Jinjian offered a cunning plan, which was to deliberately leave a gate unattacked to slacken the minds of the defending soldiers, but secretly send a small team of engineers to quietly dig a tunnel outside the north gate at night, leading to the city, secretly burying landmines, in order to bomb the city walls. How could Zhou Yuji prevent the bandits from using this trick? He only guarded against the attacking bandits at the west and south gates. Li Zicheng and Niu Jinxing, on the day when the tunnel was about to be completed, prepared to greatly destroy Daizhou. At dusk, he gave orders, telling One Tiger to lead a thousand elite soldiers and ambush in the mountains outside the north gate, and wait for the moment when the landmines exploded and the city walls collapsed, to quickly kill into the city and rush straight to the general's yamen. He also ordered the soldiers attacking the south and west gates to wait for orders to attack at night, leaving the east gate unattacked. Instead, he ambushed a force of men three or five miles away from the city, ordering the bandit general Mantianxing Jia Yang to intercept and capture Zhou Yuji and his men if they escaped. At the third watch, the landmines at the north gate did explode, and the city walls collapsed. One Tiger and others led their men into the city and seized the general's yamen, setting it on fire. The flames soared, and the red light filled the sky. The people of Daizhou cried out in alarm and fled for their lives. Zhou Yuji still wanted to struggle, and many bandits had already killed their way onto the west gate city. At this time, Xu Jing and Zhang Lie could not defend the south gate and retreated to the west gate to ask for orders, and Fan Cheng also arrived. Zhou Yuji wanted to fight the bandits, but Zhang Lie advised him, "Daizhou cannot be defended now. We should retreat to Ningwu Pass, which is also under the general's jurisdiction. If we can hold it firmly, we can still contain the bandits." (104)
