### Expressing Great Delight in the Capital
### American Aviators Come to China to Serve
### Expected to Arrive in Chongqing Within Two Months or Six Weeks
### Their Nationality and Rank Will Be Retained by the United States

Washington - It is claimed by senior authorities here that the U.S. Army has now approved the resignation of expert pilots and mechanics from the Army Air Corps so that they may fly in China. There are various rumors about the positions of American aviators serving in China, but one usually reliable source indicates that they will fly fighter planes and transport planes. Officials of the Department of the Army declined to discuss the matter. It is understood that a group of pilots and mechanics are already en route to China. The Associated Press has learned that permission to accept Chinese employment is granted to fighter pilots who have received one year of intensive training and to graduate mechanics. These volunteers retain their American nationality, and the U.S. Army authorities can recall them at any time. A certain Chinese here confirmed that such an arrangement had been made with the U.S. Army, and said that American aviators will be exclusively responsible for transport duties. When asked why China would need fighter-trained pilots, he said that because passenger planes are in danger of being attacked by the Japanese, experienced military pilots are needed. A non-official observer familiar with American aviation training commented last night that the current American training program aims to produce 30,000 pilots and 100,000 aviation mechanics each year, so a large number of American aviation experts can be supplied to China. Unconfirmed news heard here indicates that American aviators will assume combat duties, which is reminiscent of Senator Pepper's recent speech, in which he expressed the hope that American pilots would be allowed to retaliate against Tokyo on behalf of China.

Chongqing - Chinese circles have expressed great delight at the news from Washington that the U.S. Air Force has approved the resignation of its aviators to come to China to serve. Chinese circles believe that this move is the most concrete and moving step in the U.S.'s expression of its full support for China. Previous news from Washington had indicated that the U.S. would appease Japan to keep it away from the Axis powers, which caused some concern here. However, after the news of the arrival of aviation personnel in China, this concern has been dispelled. Except for the highest levels, all other sectors found this decision to be sudden. However, Chongqing newspapers have had many discussions about American planes and aviators in the past few weeks. It has been known here for some time that Chongqing wants American pilots to fly Chinese warplanes. Previously, American pilots had been afraid to come to China to serve because of the fear that they would lose their American nationality and rank in the U.S. Air Force after serving in China. However, the news from Washington now states that U.S. Army aviators can come to China to serve at will without fear of losing their rank or nationality. China considers this factor to be very important, as these pilots naturally have combat experience and good discipline. According to Chinese sources, "What we need are pilots, not adventurers." It is rumored that preparations for the food and lodging of these American pilots began last week, and they are expected to arrive here within a month or six weeks. Although the type of aircraft the United States is helping China with is a military secret, Mao Bangchu, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Air Force, recently told a reporter from the Associated Press, "Only the best and most modern American aircraft can resist Japan's new fighter planes."

Washington - Utah Senator Thomas declared yesterday, "The Far East will never prosper unless China and Japan cooperate." However, he warned, "Cooperation under oppression will not succeed." Thomas pointed out that even if cooperation under oppression succeeds temporarily, "the country that adopts such enforced cooperation will inevitably arouse much suspicion among all its neighbors." Thomas made the formal statement to Japanese journalists. He warned that if Japan goes on to incite "aggressors who are currently destroying human life," Japan will completely lose the trust of the United States. He said that if the Japanese government "takes such action now, leading to the spread of war," it would be the world's biggest mistake. (31st United Press)

U.S.-Japan Relations in a State of Emergency

Washington - Political figures stated yesterday that Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's talks this week have currently shelved hopes for improved relations between the U.S. and Japan. The two men's talks seem to have left the two countries' relations in the same place they have been for months. Although there is no immediate public conflict between the two countries, they are in a state of tension and anger. Most experts believe that relations between the two countries are likely to worsen before there is any hope of improvement. It was previously reported here unofficially that since President Roosevelt strongly avoided any unfriendly remarks about Japan in his fireside chat on Tuesday night, it was generally believed that the U.S. and Japan might improve relations. Congressional figures interpreted it as President Roosevelt having slightly changed his policy towards Japan. However, within hours, Secretary of State Hull declared that there was no change in the U.S.'s relations with Japan. Matsuoka's statement on Friday regarding Japan's foreign policy being responsible for the Tripartite Pact made observers here believe that it was directed against Hull's statement. At the same time, observers also pointed out that President Roosevelt announced in his speech that the U.S. would increase aid to China, which cannot be interpreted as Washington improving relations with Tokyo. Japan may be forced to decide whether the U.S.'s open military aid to Britain is to be interpreted as an "attack" on Germany under the Tripartite Pact. Some believe that Japan can claim that U.S. aid to Britain is not a direct attack on Germany, thus avoiding fulfilling the obligations of the Tripartite Pact. If the Nazis fire on American ships first, Japan can also excuse itself by saying that if Germany does not fire first, there is no attack by one country. By this excuse, Japan will be able to avoid being bound by the obligations of the Tripartite Pact. (31st United Press)

Washington - The "Scripps-Howard" newspapers of the United States unanimously wrote editorials yesterday, saying that President Roosevelt's fireside chat on Tuesday proved that a few congressmen and cabinet "spokesmen" were wrong. In his speech, Roosevelt poured cold water on rumors of U.S. convoys. The editorial also said that "Popper's" threat to bomb Tokyo is as dangerous as the convoy issue. The editorial also said, "Most believe that the United States has closed the door to negotiations with Japan and believes that war is inevitable. Regarding this argument, the United States and Japan should pay attention to President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, and should not blindly trust those bellicose 'representatives'. Because these 'representatives' distort the true meaning of those they represent." The editorial also said that the President sharply avoided verbal attacks on Japan in his fireside chat and said that the President "is resisting the pressure to promote war between the U.S. and Japan. The President is a down-to-earth man who knows that there is no good war and no country that can profit from war." The editorial concluded, "It is unbelievable that the President will refuse to cooperate with Japan in order to establish peace in the Pacific." (31st United Press)

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers have prominently praised Matsuoka Yosuke's declaration last night, saying that the Axis alliance is the unshakable foundation of Japan's foreign policy. All newspapers have endorsed it. (31st United Press)

### West Proposes
### Oil Embargo on Japan
### "Dong Bao" Panics Greatly

Tokyo - The Japanese news weekly published an article today, criticizing the U.S. Congressman West's bill to ban oil shipments to Japan, saying that if the bill is passed by the U.S. Congress, the current unstable situation in the Pacific will worsen. If the U.S. cuts off Japan's oil supply, Japan will naturally have to seek it elsewhere. If Japan can obtain sufficient oil from the Dutch East Indies, the proposed U.S. oil embargo will be ineffective. If Japan cannot obtain oil from the Dutch East Indies by peaceful means, West's bill will force Japan to seize oil-producing land in order to obtain an oil supply. This move will lead to an open break in U.S.-Japan relations, and all attempts to ease tensions in the Pacific will fail. But we dare to predict that the oil dispute may be resolved amicably, because if the bill is passed, the U.S. Congress will not only harm Japan's interests, but also greatly harm its own interests. Oil is essential to Japan in both peacetime and wartime. (31st Reuters)

Batavia - According to Japanese sources, Yoshizawa, the Japanese chief representative at the Batavia economic talks, said today that the Japanese delegation is now only waiting for the Dutch East Indies to respond to its proposal.

### U.S. Takes Strict Precautions
### Against Sabotage
### Of Factories and Shipyards

Washington - The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has notified police departments in major cities across the country that special precautions must be taken this weekend because of intelligence that sabotage may occur in various harbors and national defense factories. The detective team of New York has been ordered to keep a close watch on the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the 45,000-ton battleships Iowa and Mississippi are under construction, and the 35,000-ton North Carolina is being equipped. Police departments on the U.S. Atlantic coast, Pacific coast, and Great Lakes ports have also received the instruction. Among them, the police department of Detlau has taken strict precautions for the factories there, because most of the factories there manufacture national defense supplies, worth as much as 100 million yuan. At the same time, several large factories across the country have been stationed with armed police. (31st United Press)

### U.S. Public Opinion Demands
### Eventual Participation in the War
### Figures from All Walks of Life Call for Unity
### Democratic Countries Will Surely Prevail

New York - The Gallup poll announced yesterday that 85% of American voters believe that the United States will participate in the European war before it ends. The association said that the decision was very important because once the United States joins the war, most Americans will not be surprised. Psychologists and historians have repeatedly debated that any country that believes war is inevitable is very likely to participate in the war. The decision to predict U.S. participation in the war has more than doubled compared to when the war first broke out 20 months ago. (31st United Press)

Mountain Home, Tennessee - McNutt, Administrator of the U.S. Federal Security Agency, declared last night that "wherever Chinese and British people are and wherever freedom-loving democratic people are, there will be a permanent threat to dictators."

He urged the United States to strengthen democracy internally and to support the resistance to aggression with weapons externally. He said that democratic armies will win in the world war because the people of democratic countries all have a strong love of freedom and a strong will to defend civilization. (31st United Press)

Addis - Socialist leader and former presidential candidate Tommy Key gave a speech last night, saying that if the U.S. joins the European war, "we will find that we are fighting alone, fighting Germany in the Atlantic and Japan in the Pacific."

Washington - Lieutenant Colonel Haines, chairman of the Old Veterans Committee, yesterday called on the nation to unite so that the United States can "help rebuild peace in the world and maintain peace in the Americas."

He warned that the United States must not have such disloyal behavior. Newkirk, a hero of the U.S. World War, called for the implementation of convoys for Britain when necessary. He said, "If Britain falls, we will be Hitler's second target." (31st United Press)

Editorial

### Significance of the U.S. Declaration of a State of Emergency

After President Roosevelt delivered his "fireside chat" the other day, some people seemed to feel that it was not stimulating enough because the United States was not yet participating in the war or taking actual offensive actions. This is either intentionally belittling the importance of this speech or is due to expectations being too high, resulting in a feeling of inadequacy. In fact, President Roosevelt's declaration of the existence of an unlimited state of emergency was already the greatest action that the head of a non-belligerent country could take within the scope of his powers, and the importance of its significance deserves careful consideration.

Before reviewing the true value of this U.S. development, it is necessary to first understand that the positions mutually adopted by the U.S. and the axis powers are completely different: the U.S.'s anti-aggression policy is based on realistic practical actions, while the tripartite alliance's policy toward the U.S. is mostly a posture of empty threats; because the U.S. has long determined the national policy of "must aid democracy, eradicate aggression, and ensure its own security," it has always been indifferent to how the aggressor countries feel about it, not afraid of what threats the aggressor countries make against it, and even less susceptible to what temptations the aggressor countries offer it. It has always been consistently fearless and undaunted, moving towards its established national policy. Its only problem is how to prepare domestically and how to strengthen itself. It can be said that since the decision to aid democratic countries, through the establishment and implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, until the declaration of a state of emergency yesterday, the U.S.'s anti-aggression policy has always been leaping forward consistently, never turning halfway, and never hesitating for a moment. On the contrary, the tripartite alliance's attitude toward the U.S. has always been only afraid that the U.S. will interfere too actively, so it has always regarded empty threats as the ultimate goal of its actions (although sometimes it still inevitably has some dying attempts at conciliatory diplomacy), not hesitating to come up with various methods, vainly hoping to scare the U.S. away or obstruct and delay the U.S.'s actions. Therefore, the aggression front has been afraid of trouble and afraid of getting into a real fight from the beginning. From the alliance of the three countries until the recent coordination between the authorities of Germany, Japan, and Italy, the only form is intimidation, but they do not dare to directly challenge the U.S. or directly oppose the U.S. Because according to the aggressor countries' own definitions, it seems that the U.S.'s actions to aid various democratic countries have long constituted a reason to declare war on it, but in reality, the allied countries have not only not declared war, but have even abandoned the usual protests, for fear of turning a feigned move into reality and provoking the U.S., which is pragmatic and truly capable. What is ridiculous is that until now, the various allied countries' interpretation of the alliance seems to be still unclear.

Although the U.S.'s proactive position is fundamentally different from the aggression front's intimidating posture, in terms of the nature of the position, the U.S. is ultimately on the passive side, while Germany, Italy, and Japan are on the active side. Therefore, solely on the issue of war or no war, the U.S. must be in a passive position. In other words, the U.S. can at most be on one side waiting in full battle array, while on the other side disregarding everything to push forward its aid policy. Unless the aggression front offends it first, the U.S. will never, and definitely should not, take the initiative to declare war first. Based on this, if the world wants to ask whether the U.S. will fight, it must first ask whether the aggression front truly has the courage and preparation to provoke the U.S. In more concrete terms, it must ask whether Germany is truly prepared to sink U.S. ships when the U.S. escorts them, and whether Japan is truly prepared to invoke the tripartite alliance and respond to Germany and Italy's offensive against Britain in the Far East. Assuming that it is, the U.S., having already declared a state of emergency, indicating its greatest determination, will inevitably fight back without a doubt. Assuming that it is not, then the U.S., only seeking that its aid policy is not hindered, so that various democratic countries can defeat aggression with its support, will of course be happy to continue to maintain its non-belligerent status.

In summary, it can be seen that the U.S.'s declaration of a state of emergency is precisely the most proactive move that can be defended and attacked. It shows that the U.S. no longer has a mentality of hoping to be spared by chance, that the U.S. has absolutely no mentality of "fear of war," and that the U.S. will never "retreat in the face of difficulty" because of the intimidation of the aggression front. This attitude comes from a non-belligerent country, can it not be considered to be active to the peak state? Is it not enough to show the U.S.'s selfless and chivalrous spirit?

### He Yingqin Declares: China Determined to Continue Fighting; Past US Aid to China Satisfactory; Hopes to Obtain Heavy Artillery, Aircraft, and Raw Materials in the Future

Chongqing: Chief of Staff and Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin declared today that China has linked its fate with that of Britain and the United States, and no matter what the situation in Europe may be, China will adhere to its policy and never change. Minister He, in a private interview with a United Press reporter, expressed his belief that Britain, with the aid of the United States, will be able to persevere and will not collapse like France. At worst, it will only be temporarily trapped. Minister He also said that China and the United States have common goals, and President Roosevelt's declaration of unlimited national emergency will not only strengthen the US national defense but also greatly increase aid to countries fighting for self-preservation and independence. President Roosevelt's fireside chat was not only an encouragement to free China, but also a clear support for China's war of resistance, so those who are hesitating in the occupied areas can also gain courage to resist the invaders. President Roosevelt's speech was a severe blow to the puppet regime of Wang Jingwei. Minister He then turned to discuss China's position in resisting aggression. He said that China is a fundamental member of the Sino-British-American alliance, because it has been actively fighting for four years and is still determined to continue until victory. Minister He also answered reporters' questions, saying that in his opinion, if the United States goes to war with Japan, China is willing to allow the United States to use all the airfields and other aviation facilities in China as much as possible during the duration of the war. This does not mean that the US Air Force will be commanded by China, but that China will supply all its aviation facilities for the use of the US Air Force commanded by the United States. On this point, Minister He admitted that he had also heard that American volunteer aviators had joined the Chinese Air Force to fly the American aircraft currently acquired by China, but he declined to comment on this news. Minister He also discussed Sino-British cooperation, saying that if Japan attacks Burma, China will send troops to Burma to help if requested by Britain, but there is currently no such tacit understanding or agreement. Minister He also stated that he is generally satisfied with the amount and type of assistance given to China by the United States. He said that the items needed by China have been sent to Washington and have been approved, and the goods can now be supplied accordingly. Minister He also said that Japan's occupation of the islands has revealed Japan's plan not only to dominate the Pacific but also to threaten the United States and the world. He said that he believed that the United States should recognize this threat. Minister He said, "We have learned that the United States is now focusing on the Atlantic, so the Pacific may not be critical at the moment, but I think from a military point of view, the United States should first solve the Pacific problem. If the United States cannot actively provide us with military assistance at this time, then we can at least expect more material or financial assistance. What China hopes to obtain is heavy artillery, aircraft, and the necessary raw materials for munitions." (31st United Press Special Correspondent Pace dispatch)

London: Official announcements continued, stating that since Ali Gailani fled Iraq, the committee organized by the mayor of Baghdad, which now rules the city, has requested a ceasefire from the British side. London has not heard about the terms of the ceasefire, but it is known that this request was made in the last 48 hours. According to dispatches from Cairo, British troops arrived on the outskirts of Baghdad on the evening of Friday and invaded the suburbs of the city. London sources emphasized that the German failure to fulfill its promise of assistance to Gailani must have had a significant impact on the heroic achievements of the British troops on Crete, because the British resistance caused the German troops and aircraft originally intended to be transferred to Iraq to be used on the island. Responsible persons here all said that the conflict between the British side and the rebels has become a thing of the past. Now the whole world knows that any dispute in Iraq is not between the Arabs and the British, but between the British and the Germans. What is important now is that Gailani did not obey the instructions of his German masters and fled to Iran. It is reported that Gailani was accompanied by members of his cabinet, the puppet regent, and the German and Italian ministers. The termination of the conflict between the Central Army and the rebels does not mean that there are no traces of German troops in Iraq, and that there are no German aircraft or personnel or conflicts with British troops in the area. Moreover, there is much evidence indicating that the people of Iraq will welcome the return of their legitimate regent, Ilah. (31st Reuters dispatch)

Beirut: Iraqi sources said today that Baghdad has declared itself a demilitarized city. Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the outskirts of Baghdad. (31st United Press dispatch)

Cairo: Rumor has it that after Ali Gailani fled, the new military commander of Baghdad, Seba Hua, who is also the Minister of Economic Affairs, organized a security committee with Baghdad officials and gentry, ordering all irregular groups of a military nature to be dissolved. It is widely expected that the terrifying situation in Baghdad will end soon. Members of all illegal organizations were ordered to surrender their weapons to the police, so they wore civilian clothes. The security committee issued two articles, advising the public to remain calm and abide by discipline. Those who cause disturbances and unrest will be severely punished. Since Gailani seized power, there have often been thugs drawing graffiti, randomly shooting in the streets, and shouting and howling at night. Foreigners dare not go out without police protection and must wear armbands. All embassies have military police protection. At the same time, the water in the lower reaches of the Euphrates River overflowed, causing the Central Army to fail to advance rapidly towards Baghdad. The Iraqi people destroyed the sluice gate. Yesterday, British air squadrons launched multiple strikes to support the British troops attacking Baghdad. Enemy motor transport teams on the Fallujah side were heavily bombed by British aircraft. Italian aircraft were initially discovered in Iraq yesterday. Last night, the British Air Force Communiqué stated that the British aircraft strafed the Baqubah airfield very successfully. Many Italian Fiat fighter planes and other aircraft were destroyed and rendered unusable. (31st Reuters dispatch)

Ankara: The Turkish Grand National Assembly unanimously passed a motion of confidence in the army yesterday, stating that the Turkish army is ready to defend the country. The Turkish Grand National Assembly expressed its special trust. After the motion of confidence was passed, Minister of Defense Tinaz delivered a speech to the Grand National Assembly, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the Turkish army. (31st Haitong dispatch)

Ankara: The budget has been unanimously passed after four days of debate in parliament. Prime Minister Saydam, at the end of the debate, delivered a speech stating that the greatest political achievement completed by the Turkish Parliament at this time of tense international situation is to remain calm and fulfill its own responsibilities.

### The Battle of Crete Reaches a Decisive Stage; Attacked from the East and West by Axis Forces; British Troops Retreat into the Mountains to Set Up Defensive Positions; Allied Commander Freyberg Safe

London: Due to frequent reinforcements from the German army, pressing from the east and west, the war-weary British Royal Army has reportedly set up defensive positions in the narrow roads of the Cretan mountains as a last stronghold. However, London has not confirmed the news about the defenders withdrawing from this strategically important island. The British troops withdrawing from Suda Bay have reportedly joined forces with the British troops from Rethymno or Heraklion. However, according to Cairo news, British troops are still holding Heraklion. If the German claim that German troops have reached Rethymno and occupied Heraklion is true, then this news is sufficient to show that most of the main roads along the northern coast must already be in German hands. If the retreat of the British troops has been decided, the British Royal Army will have to go through the mountains to the coast on the south coast, imitating the tactics of the Battle of Dunkirk, and leave the island by ferry. However, it is feared that the British troops at that time will not be able to retreat from Dunkirk under the cover of aircraft like they did when crossing the English Channel last year. According to Cairo news, Australian, New Zealand, British, and Greek troops with bloodshot eyes, tired spirits, and covered in dust are now fighting in the valleys and rugged roads of the mountains, guarding rocky riverbeds, building stone fortresses, and hurriedly setting up machine gun positions to protect the sloping foothills. Clifford, the military correspondent of the "Daily Mail," reported from Cairo that after ten days of uninterrupted hand-to-hand combat, the New Zealand army is almost still fighting automatically. The Greek army, in order to maintain its determination not to surrender, continues to load bullets into its guns and shoots at the enemy, killing one person and then another. However, the Greek army now knows that the loss of soldiers has no impact on the plans of the German high command. A spokesman for the British Air Force in Cairo said that the situation is extremely delicate and serious, and the London newspapers have already hinted that Crete will be lost and have begun to speculate on Hitler's second move. They believe that his second move will be to attack Cyprus. The Daily Mail wrote, "The reason for our failure in the Cretan War is the same as other battles in this war of resistance against the Germans, namely, the lack of equipment. We now anticipate that the Germans will have the same rapid attempt to occupy Cyprus. Only if we abandon illusions and have more artillery, warships, aircraft, and tanks can we defend the island of Cyprus." The Times said, "The future of Crete is even more hopeless." The military correspondent of the Chronicle News declared, "The enemy's strength in the battle of Crete is now more obvious, and its momentum is increasing day by day." (31st United Press dispatch)

Berlin: The German military communiqué this afternoon stated that the German troops who had been dispatched to Crete were continuing to pursue the enemy eastward, and had made contact with the German paratroopers in Heraklion, and it was hoped that they would soon join forces with the Italian troops advancing westward from the east coast. Yesterday, German bombers attacked enemy concentration areas and enemy retreat routes. The British remnants attempted to escape to British warships from the southern end of the island, so German aircraft bombed the ports on the south coast most fiercely. The British fleet south of Crete encountered bombing, and one destroyer was heavily damaged. (31st Haitong dispatch)

London: According to the latest news received in London, German troops continued to land on Crete from the air. Apart from the above news, there are very few reports about the truth. According to Alexandria dispatches, British wounded arriving there estimate that German casualties in Crete are between 10,000 and 15,000. It is claimed that 1,500 of the paratroopers were killed on the first day. According to the general opinion of people in London, no matter what happens to Crete, the British action is completely justified. There are two reasons: (1) The British annihilated well-trained German troops and their special equipment; (2) Allowing British troops to clear up the situation in other places. (31st Reuters dispatch)

London: The War Office announced today that the commander of the British forces in Crete, General Freyberg, is still safe and in the army. The German claim that he has died is false. (31st Reuters dispatch)

Berlin: With the imminent fall of Crete, the Hamburg Foreign News diplomatic correspondent Halferld yesterday published an article in the newspaper, describing the future political and military importance of the island to Germany, stating in brief: Germany's decision to attack Crete proves that Germany has been able to cope with the military difficulties of fighting on islands. The capture of Crete by Germany and Italy can conquer one of the four pillars of the British Empire's maritime defense in the eastern Mediterranean. These four pillars are Crete, Haifa, Alexandria, and Tobruk. This war in Crete can be regarded as part of a large-scale offensive against the main lifeline of the British Empire. Therefore, Britain tried its best to prevent Germany from occupying the island, not hesitating to allow its fleet to be bombed by German aircraft, in an attempt to salvage the island's crisis. However, the British naval and air forces did not succeed in fighting on the island, and suffered heavy losses. To this day, only the navy can maintain its prestige, but in the battle of Crete, the British navy has also met its match. Britain in the eastern Mediterranean now has Egypt and India as its main bases, with the Suez, Palestine, and other places as its periphery, serving as its last line of retreat.

### British Newspaper Reveals Franco-German Collaboration Plan: Darlan Shamelessly Seeks Favor and Honors, Agrees to Offer French Colonies for German Use

Paris: French Vice-Premier Darlan stated in a speech last night that collaboration with Germany is the fundamental policy of the French government, for if France does not collaborate with Germany today, the nation cannot survive. (Reuter dispatch, 31st)

London: The contents of the collaboration plan devised by Vichy Deputy Premier Darlan and the agreement established between Hitler and Darlan on May 11th are now detailed in local newspapers. Darlan's plan, drafted by Darlan, Laval, and German representative Abetz in Paris from December 13th of last year to February 25th of this year (the period when Darlan held great power in the Vichy government), is based on France (1) fully acknowledging its defeat in both the mainland and colonies, (2) adhering to the new order established by Hitler, and (3) assisting Germany's victory to the greatest possible extent. In return, Germany will make every effort to secure Darlan's succession to Marshal Pétain as head of France and will grant Darlan the title of First Admiral of Europe. Darlan and Laval have also reached an understanding that once Darlan becomes the head of France, Laval will become the Premier of the French government. As for the Hitler-Darlan agreement of May 11th, it stipulates the concrete stages for implementing Darlan's plan. Some parts of this plan have already been implemented and are visible to all, namely the placement of French munitions and factories under German management, the unrestricted passage of French merchant ships through the British blockade line for Germany, and the transport of German munitions to Africa on French ships. The Syrian aircraft incident is a prelude to the advancement of Darlan's plan. It is rumored that other French colonies will also be made available to Germany when needed by the German command. In his speech on May 23rd, Darlan attempted to explain the reasons for his agreement with Hitler, but some things were left unsaid, and others were expressed ambiguously. In his statement that "Hitler did not ask me for French colonies," the term "colonies" was intended to mislead the world. In French officialdom, the term "colonies" never included mandated territories (such as Syria) or protectorates (such as Tunisia and Morocco). Darlan used this term with two intentions: one, for his future self-defense before the French people, and two, to deceive foreigners such as the British and Americans. On the one hand, he could later defend himself to the French people by saying that what Hitler did not ask for were French colonies, but not French mandated territories and protectorates. On the other hand, he could create a false impression among foreigners that the future of France's general colonies was secure. In reality, one thing is beyond doubt today: Darlan and the Vichy authorities are actively collaborating with Germany and will make Tunisia, Morocco, and Dakar available for German army and air force use when Germany is ready to utilize these locations. Darlan's plan also involves the French navy, but there is no question of transferring it to Germany. Darlan has agreed to assist Germany in the war with French warships and crew in a gradual manner, taking a path of provocation against Britain, hoping that the British and French fleets will eventually break down emotionally and openly engage in battle. Darlan's plan is half implemented and half in preparation. It should be noted that before the end of May 1940, among the three great marshals of the French army, Gamelin, the air force, Vuillemin, and the navy, Darlan's pronouncements were the most vehement in advocating military sanctions against Germany. Unexpectedly, he ultimately sided with defeatists, and the conspiracy behind this will be described in detail later. (Reuter dispatch, 30th)

### The Rift Between Britain and France Deepens: Darlan Declares French Territory Inviolable, Accuses Britain of Violating International Law for Bombing Tunisia

Paris: French Vice-Premier Darlan issued a statement to newspapers in the unoccupied zone this morning, stating that France will no longer tolerate British violations of French territory and insults to the French flag. Following the bombing of the port of Sfax in Tunisia, he is even more determined that French rights must be respected. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 31st)

Vichy: Regarding the British naval bombardment of the port of Sfax in Tunisia, the local propaganda office recently issued a press release stating, "In defending its bombardment, the British propaganda machine has claimed that Italian merchant ships were discovered near the port or within Tunisian territorial waters. However, this argument has no legal value. It should be known that even if a destroyer of a belligerent country stays in the territorial waters of a neutral country for only a few hours, other belligerent countries have no reason to invade this neutral country. This is because, according to Article 5 of the 1907 Hague International Convention, which both Britain and France jointly participated in, warships of belligerent countries may stay in neutral territorial waters for three periods, each lasting twenty-four hours. Moreover, this event is completely similar to the case of the German warship Admiral Spee. At that time, after the German warship sought refuge in the port of Montevideo in Uruguay, the British fleet complied with the Hague Convention and did not bombard it." (Hava Khan dispatch, 30th)

French Forces in North Africa Advance Towards Chad

Vichy: Yesterday, it was stated here that French forces have passed through the Sahara Desert and are advancing towards Lake Chad, the base of the Free French forces led by Tchol, to preserve the integrity of French territory. This news coincides with the German radio report that Germany has promised to strengthen the French National Defense Forces. (Italian radio also claimed that because British aircraft bombed ships in the port of Sfax, General Weygand has ordered the anti-aircraft artillery units in French colonial ports to retaliate.) It also stated that French forces are advancing along the west coast of Chad, encountering no resistance, have occupied Gomi, and have established a radio station there. (United Press Agency dispatch, 31st)

### Gale Winds and Snow, Raging Waves: A Chronicle of the Anglo-German Naval Battle, British Fleet Pursues for Three Days and Four Nights, Bismarck Finally Sinks to the Bottom of the Sea

London: A Reuters correspondent with the Inland Fleet reported that the journalist witnessed the giant ship battle and the sinking of the German 35,000-ton, so-called unsinkable, new battleship "Bismarck" to the bottom of the sea. The journalist observed the battle from the bridge of a British warship and saw the "Hood" sink only two or three hundred yards away amid a barrage of gunfire. The largest naval battle in this decisive event unfolded between Greenland and Iceland, followed by a pursuit that lasted three days and four nights, ultimately sinking the "Bismarck," which the German fleet boasted about. The "Hood" was a battlecruiser built twenty-one years ago. Shortly after the battle began, it was hit by a shell, immediately catching fire, and exploding fragments flew everywhere, reaching hundreds of feet high. After a few minutes, all that remained was a cluster of thick smoke on the water surface and a few fragments. Shortly after, the German warship "Prinz Eugen" was also hit by a 15-inch shell, with minor damage. This decisive naval battle was initiated when the "Hood" and "Prince of Wales" pursued the "Bismarck" to prevent it from sneaking into the Atlantic to attack convoys. They continuously pursued from outside Iceland, taking advantage of the dim light of the Arctic night. The British cruisers "Norfolk" and "Suffolk" had been tracking the "Bismarck" since it left Bergen, constantly reporting the "Bismarck's" movements to the "Hood" and "Prince of Wales." The sky remained half-lit throughout the night, and by two or three in the morning, it was already dawn, followed by dense fog, a gray gloom like London in the winter afternoon. At times, nothing could be seen a few yards away in the wind and snow sweeping across the sea. It was estimated that around two o'clock in the morning, the British warships should have made contact with the "Bismarck," but the German warship changed course at the last moment. The "Hood" and "Prince of Wales" continued to advance along the line parallel to the enemy warship. The wind and snow intensified. Four hours later, the snow stopped, and it suddenly cleared. Two black dots could be seen on the horizon, namely the "Bismarck" and the cruiser "Prinz Eugen." The British warship then sped forward to shorten the distance with the enemy warship. The enemy warship also turned to face the battle. As they gradually approached, the giant gun at the front of the "Hood" suddenly roared, and orange-yellow fire flashed. Within three seconds, the "Bismarck" also opened fire. The giant guns of the "Prince of Wales" followed with a roar, and yellow smoke filled the air. Shells fell into the sea near the "Hood," shooting water high into the air like springs. The "Hood" continued to advance. Shortly after, it was hit by a shell, which seemed to have landed in front of the 15-inch turret. A huge fire immediately broke out, and thick smoke billowed. Then a loud explosion was heard, and the entire warship was engulfed in flames. Black smoke blotted out the sky, and the smokestack and mast were blasted into the sky. The stern sank, and the bow stood vertically on the surface of the water. After three or four minutes, it completely sank. A British destroyer rushed to the rescue, rescuing only two sailors and one midshipman from the "Hood." The "Prince of Wales" continued to bombard the "Bismarck" fiercely. Then shells exploded near the "Prince of Wales," and the hull suffered minor damage, but its combat effectiveness and speed were not affected at all. The "Bismarck" seized the opportunity to escape, but it was still pursued relentlessly by British warships in the Atlantic that day and the next. At night, the "Prince of Wales" bombarded the "Bismarck" twice. The British warship "Victorious" and "Ark Royal" also sent torpedo planes to attack it. The British warships pursued for three days and four nights, never stopping the attack. Finally, the British warship "Dorsetshire" joined the battle and sank the "Bismarck" with torpedoes. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

A British Port: British naval officers who participated in this decisive Anglo-German naval battle stated that the German elite battleship "Bismarck" did not look like the claimed 35,000 tons in appearance, but seemed closer to 50,000 tons, actually a super-dreadnought. The British warships pursued the warship for a total of 1,750 miles. Along the way, the warship was hit by torpedoes. (United Press Agency dispatch, 31st)

### Germany Captures Crete: Releases Artificial Fog, Causing the Enemy to Lose Direction

Rome: Yesterday's Athens dispatch from the "Piccolo Newspaper" stated, "The German advance on Crete was aided by artificial fog, which, in addition to disorienting the enemy, had a demoralizing effect." The dispatch stated, "Once the 'artificial fog' was used, 'the enemy could only see shadows and were at a loss, and some Australian and Greek soldiers even ran into the arms of the German army.'" (United Press Agency dispatch, 31st)

### The Capital of Southern Ireland: Suffers Another Air Raid, Three Giant Bombs Dropped, Casualties Exceed One Hundred

Dublin: Although only three bombs were dropped on Dublin last night, it was learned today that these three bombs killed thirty to forty people, injured over a hundred, destroyed fifty houses, and caused a major fire. At dawn, ten houses were still burning. Since the start of this decisive event, this is the second time Dublin has been bombed, and the eighth time the Irish Free State has been bombed. The United Press Agency reporter's residence was only three hundred yards away from one of the bombed locations, so after hearing the bombing, he got up and went to inspect the scene. He saw women and children wearing only pajamas, crying out in extreme fear. Children were running and shouting for their parents everywhere, and parents were also searching for their children. The nuns of the nearby St. Paul's Orphanage also came out to help, and the air defense personnel and military authorities reunited the scattered families and helped to dig out those who were buried. The orphanage, with three hundred orphans, was undamaged, only shaken. The first bomb fell at 1:40 a.m. on the North Circular Road, destroying three houses and causing a fire. Fifteen minutes later, while the fire brigade was extinguishing the fire, the sound of an air raid siren was heard again. Firefighters and onlookers all lay on the ground. The street was full of glass, as another bomb had fallen nearby, destroying eight houses and burying the people inside. Ten minutes later, another bomb fell on the North Strand. Soldiers, air defense teams, and ambulance teams rushed to the bombed locations. The bombed locations were all within a quarter of a mile of each other. The number of deaths is likely to increase as those buried are dug out, and there is little hope for most of those buried under the rubble. (United Press Agency dispatch, 31st)

### Map Explanation

In yesterday's report on the map of the Western Hemisphere and the affiliated islands of various countries, the "Lesser Antilles" in the small box should be changed to "Leeward Islands."

The West Indies, also known as the Antilles, extend from the Florida Peninsula in the United States to the coast of Venezuela in South America, guarding the ports of Mexico to the west and forming the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Based on the shape of the island clusters, they are divided into three groups: (1) the Greater Antilles, (2) the Lesser Antilles, and (3) the Bahama Islands. Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico are the Greater Antilles. The islands to the north are the Bahama Islands, and the islands to the southeast are the Lesser Antilles.

The Lesser Antilles are broadly divided into the Leeward and Windward Islands. The Leeward Islands are located between Puerto Rico and Martinique, occupying the northern part of the Lesser Antilles. Among them, Guadeloupe and the nearby small islands belong to France, and the rest belong to Britain.

The Windward Islands, in addition to the French territory of Martinique, include St. Lucia and Trinidad. Among them, Barbados is an important British naval base in the West Indies. Cape Verde Islands can also be translated as Green Cape Islands.

### No Sign of Appeasement Towards Japan: America Guarantees to Accelerate Aid to China, Roosevelt Also Expands Embargo Scope, Woodhead Explains American Foreign Policy

British renowned commentator Woodhead commented on President Roosevelt's fireside chat in the English-language "China Press" yesterday, stating briefly that President Roosevelt's recent fireside chat seemed less stern in condemning Japan than in condemning Hitler, leading some to mistakenly believe that the American government seemed to be pursuing a policy of appeasement towards Japan. In reality, this view is greatly mistaken.

Further Intensifying Aid

It should be known that President Roosevelt's speech both paid tribute to China's war effort and guaranteed to further assist the Chongqing government, and predicted that China's defense capabilities would be greatly enhanced, sufficient to resist Japan and help prevent Hitler from dominating the world. Therefore, it can be known that there is absolutely no intention of appeasement.

Embargo on Industrial Raw Materials from the Philippines

Moreover, within hours of President Roosevelt's speech, he extended the export licensing system to the Philippines and immediately banned the export of all raw materials necessary for military industries from the Philippines to Japan, because since Japan joined the Axis powers, it has become a threat to democratic countries. Assuming that appeasement were to occur between the United States and Japan in the future, this appeasement would definitely not be initiated by the United States, but would come from Japan, because the Roosevelt government's foreign policy has never had any intention of appeasement.

### American President Liners, Four Ships Being Requisitioned Unconfirmed, Chinese and Foreign Individuals Attach Great Importance to This Move, Tickets for the Four Liners Already Fully Booked

According to yesterday's report from the Reuters Washington dispatch, it was said that four mail ships of the American President Lines operating on the Far East route have been requisitioned by the American government as auxiliary warships. These four ships are the President Jackson, the President Adams (both world class), the President Taft, and the President Pierce (both Pacific class), all over 10,000 tons. After the British company Chang Hsing’s Queen Liners were all requisitioned and suspended services last autumn, the American President Lines is now the only line maintaining the Pacific route. Now, after American President Roosevelt delivered a fireside chat declaring the protection of maritime freedom, two of these ships and two world-class mail ships were requisitioned, reflecting that the international situation seems to be trending towards a more tense state. Therefore, Chinese and foreign individuals attach great importance to this move.

No Telegram Received from Head Office

The Ta Chung News Agency reporter visited the local President Lines office yesterday to inquire about the situation. It was said that, as of yesterday, no telegram had been received from the New York head office stating that the four liners had been requisitioned. Whether this statement is true, it is currently impossible to speculate. It is heard that a large number of expatriates from various countries in this city intend to leave Shanghai on the above liners, and the berths on each liner have long been fully booked. If the news of the requisition is indeed confirmed, tickets will inevitably be refunded. For this reason, those who went to the company yesterday to inquire about the truth were particularly crowded, and they were also concerned about whether other liners would be similarly affected. According to the company's staff, before receiving the telegram from the head office, the remaining liners will operate as usual, without a doubt. It is heard that the President Liners currently operating and scheduled to join the service this year, including the world class, total twelve ships. The dedicated ships sailing in the Pacific are the Coolidge, Pierce, Taft, and Cleveland. The Coolidge and Cleveland will arrive in Shanghai soon, departing on a specific date of the fifth and eighth, respectively.

Shanghai-Vietnam Route Will Not Be Halted

The Continental Daily News reported that the French mail ship General Joffre was rumored to be unable to sail to Vietnam due to crew disputes. Yesterday (30th), reliable sources were unable to confirm this statement. Furthermore, the Far East General Manager of the French Mail Company, Mr. Kogia, also denied the rumor that the company's fuel ships traveling between Shanghai and Vietnam would be suspended due to a lack of fuel. Mr. Kogia refused to disclose the reason why the General Joffre could not sail. According to authoritative sources, the French Mail Company's fuel ships will indeed be suspended, but the coal-burning ships will continue to operate. According to the company's employees, the company expects to have as many as five ships arriving in Shanghai before June 10th. Therefore, there is no risk of the company's route being completely suspended.

In addition, it was reported that, according to news from the French Mail Company, the reason why the General Joffre failed to sail as scheduled the day before yesterday was that the company received a telegram from Saigon, instructing it to suspend operations temporarily. Therefore, it is still berthed at the Blue Funnel Wharf and has not yet left Shanghai.

### Water Company Increases Surcharge

The British-owned Water Company issued a notice stating that, with regard to the surcharge on water rates for all users to whom the company supplies water in accordance with the business contract established with the Shanghai Municipal Council, it has now been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement that the current 110% surcharge specified in the current price will be increased to 250% in each water bill from July 1, 1941. In other words, for all expenses calculated based on the water meters copied on and after July 1, 1941, a 250% surcharge will be added uniformly. This notice is hereby given.

### Poor People Sipping Congee at Congee Kitchen Increase to Over Four Thousand

The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association believes that the price of rice in this city is soaring endlessly, and it is particularly difficult for the poor to find food. Therefore, in February of this year, it opened a congee kitchen at the original site of the Tzu Yuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road. When the association opened the kitchen, it originally planned to close it after February. However, because the number of poor people sipping congee is increasing daily, it has been decided to extend it for a few more months before making a final decision. However, since the kitchen opened, the number of poor people sipping congee has averaged around 2,000 per day. In the past few days, the number of congee sippers has suddenly increased to more than 4,000.

### British Naval Minister Broadcasting to the Far East, News Related to Current Situation, Four Broadcasts Tomorrow Morning and Afternoon

The British government's Secretary of State for Naval Affairs, Mr. Alexander, is scheduled to broadcast to the Far East from the BBC in London tomorrow. Shanghai time is (1) 1:11 a.m., wavelengths are 19.82, 25.53, and 31.25 meters, (2) 8:00 a.m., wavelengths are 25.53 and 31.33 meters, (3) 3:30 p.m., wavelength is 19.82 meters, (4) 8:11 p.m., wavelengths are 16.84 and 19.82 meters. Those with shortwave radios can listen in at the scheduled times. It is reported that this speech by the British Naval Minister will definitely be related to President Roosevelt's fireside chat delivered on Tuesday night and the Mediterranean war situation.

### Two Labor Strikes, Labor and Management Compromise

The smaller taxi companies in this city, including Yi Tai Hua, Li Mei Hua, Jiang Su, You Ning, and Shi Jie, a total of eighteen companies, had an overall driver strike that has lasted for a week since midnight on the 25th of last month. It is now learned that when labor and management conducted negotiations at 10 a.m. yesterday, with repeated concessions, the management agreed to (1) rice subsidy: If Saigon No. 2 rice ranges from $30 to $70, an increase of $3 will be added for every $10 increase; if it exceeds $70, an increase of $5 will be added for every $10 increase, (2) cost of living allowance: calculated as 75% of the rice subsidy. Therefore, some taxi companies, such as Yi Tai, Mei Hua, and Jiang Su, announced the resumption of work at 1 p.m. yesterday. Other taxi companies, such as You Yi and Da Kang, have not resolved the labor unrest because labor and management did not attend the negotiations yesterday. It is expected that it can be resolved satisfactorily in the next day or two. Also,

The yarn socks dyers had once gone on strike to demand improved treatment. After negotiations between labor and management, a satisfactory solution was reached yesterday. Those with monthly wages above $20 will receive a 50% increase, and those below $20 will receive a 60% increase. For dyeing yarn socks of various colors, all original wages will be increased by 50%. For dyeing yarn, based on the original wage standard, $2 will be added for each piece priced at $2, $2 will also be added for pieces priced at $3, $1.6 will be added for pieces priced at $4, $1 will be added for pieces priced at $5, and 10% will be added for pieces priced at $6 and above. The above measures will take effect starting today (1st).

### Greek Government Telegraphed Shanghai Report: German Atrocities

The Greek Consulate General in this city received a telegram from the Greek government yesterday, condemning the German atrocities in Crete in the strongest terms. It is reported that the Greek government is willing to announce to the world the atrocities committed by the enemy on the island of Crete. All three cities on the island were actually deserted due to repeated air raids. The Germans carried out organized massacres in their air raids on the island, as if a sewing machine sews from one side to the other, bombing back and forth endlessly, turning the three cities into nothing but ruins. All the women and children who fled were brutally killed by machine gun fire, and finally, they set them on fire to complete their work of destruction. This situation did not spare even hospitals and ambulances.

### Today is the Memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Interment: All Circles Devoutly Follow His Will, Seek Freedom and Equality for China, and Complete the Great Cause of National Rejuvenation

Today is the 6/1 Dr. Sun Yat-sen's interment memorial day. National party and government agencies are holding memorials as usual. Shanghai is not holding memorial ceremonies due to its special environment. However, given the time of national crisis, all circles have decided to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, follow national policies, seek the revolutionary goals indicated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in seeking freedom and equality for China, and complete the great cause of national rejuvenation.

### May Living Expenses Still Higher Than April, As Rice Prices Only Began to Fall in the Latter Half of the Month, Food Prices Rose Sharply, Fuel Fell

In the latter half of May, the price of small refined rice per shih fell from a peak of 143 yuan on May 3rd to below 110 yuan, the price set by the Public Works Department for Hong Kong rice per shih. Prices for other types of rice also fell simultaneously. However, the average rice price for the month was much higher than in April and at the end of May. This was because the Public Works Department's foreign rice only began retail sales on May 17th, and prices in the first half of the month were also high.

Price of Goods Increased, Fuel Slightly Decreased

Some items this month, such as flour, coal briquettes, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, local cloth, and soap, loosened along with the fall in rice prices. However, the prices of fish, meat, vegetables, lard, and salt rose significantly. Therefore, the average price fluctuation for the month was still higher than last month. The overall index rose from 732.7 yuan last month to 802.68, an increase of 69.89 points. Among the classified indices, the food index rose from 815.09 to 923.18, an increase of 108.09 points.

Minimum Living Expenses

The following figures represent the actual income of the head of a working-class family and other family members, as well as other income in the household. The meaning of actual income refers to wages and all allowances. These figures are based on a study of the income distribution of working-class families and living expenses in May. The table below shows how much income is needed to maintain a lifestyle below that of 1936 (i.e., living standard A) and a minimum standard of living (i.e., living standard B) under two assumed levels of living.

Note: This index is based on the living standards of workers in 1936 before the war. Recently, with the cost of living rising and living standards falling, the increase in expenses in May of this year, in terms of the degree of reduction, was 6.44 times.

### Jardine Matheson Shipping Department Chinese Manager Pan Zhiquan Returns to Shanghai Yesterday

Mr. Pan Zhiquan, the Chinese manager of the shipping department of Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd., went to Hong Kong for recuperation due to illness at the beginning of last month. He has now recovered and returned to Shanghai yesterday on the company's Yusheng ship. Yesterday, the ship docked at the Roosevelt Wharf at noon and he is scheduled to report to work on Monday.

### Rice Registration Aims to Eliminate Manipulation

In order to thoroughly stabilize the food supply for Shanghai citizens and prevent the transfer of rice and grain to other areas and eliminate hoarding, the authorities of the two concessions have ordered the Rice Industry Association to register all imported foreign rice. According to sources from the Rice Industry Association yesterday morning, the registration form is in triplicate. When rice merchants register with the authorities, they must fill it out in the prescribed format. It is said that one copy will be kept by the rice merchant, one copy will be kept by the authorities for verification, and one copy will be submitted to the ordering foreign firm or the warehouse. Currently, the Rice Industry Association has not yet informed its member firms of the measures and will implement them after joint deliberation. This measure is indeed the only effective way to stabilize the food supply and prevent the transfer of rice and grain to other areas. All rice merchants and citizens should provide practical assistance, and Rice Industry Committee members should not refuse. Furthermore, the types of rice to be registered by the authorities are limited to Saigon rice. As for the dozen or so foreign firms under the supervision of the Import Committee of the French Municipal Council last month, which usually deal in Vietnamese foreign rice, the authorities intend to order them to also register the Vietnamese foreign rice they ordered previously that has not yet arrived in Shanghai.

Selling Deceptively

Since various rice shops in this city have been selling Rangoon special small refined rice supplied by the Hong Kong government at a price of only 110 yuan per shih (160 city catties), which is vastly different from the price of rice sold by local rice merchants every day, some rice shops selling Hong Kong rice have boldly changed the bags and tried to sell it deceptively in the market, attempting to transfer it to other areas for profit, which is worthy of attention.

If the amount is too large, the bureau will notify the exchange bureau to send personnel to escort the money.

Armed Escort

Before the incident yesterday, the bureau transferred a total of 2.5 million yuan, including all remittances and savings, to the exchange bureau as usual. It also notified the exchange bureau to send Wang Xufu, the director of the cashier department, and two armed bodyguards to escort the money. At that time, the post office wrapped the money and ordered employees to carry it to the open space in the large packaging room, where the exchange bureau's insurance car was waiting.

Fully Loaded and Gone

Unexpectedly, four robbers suddenly appeared, all carrying pistols, monitoring the bodyguards' actions. The remaining two robbers moved all the money onto a Studebaker green car with license plate number 5152, which was parked there, and sped away without a trace.

### Paint Industry Strike Resolved

Workers Resumed Work After Salary Raised. Paint workers, seeing that the cost of living in Shanghai was rising day by day, making it impossible to maintain a livelihood, held meetings between labor and management at the guild starting on the 4th of last month. As a result, both parties agreed to increase wages by one yuan per day. Unexpectedly, Ni Shengji Construction Factory on Chengdu Road boldly and with bad intentions took the lead in publishing a statement in the newspaper on the 22nd declaring that it would renege on the agreement and not fulfill the terms. Workers from the factory took the lead in launching a strike, leading to a response from thousands of paint workers throughout the city.

(Chongqing Air Mail News) In order to promote vocational supplementary education, the Ministry of Education has detailed the outline. The full text is copied below.

Outline of Measures for Provinces and Cities to Promote Vocational Supplementary Education

1.  Educational administrative agencies in all provinces and cities should follow the provisions of this outline and earnestly promote vocational supplementary education, and they must submit detailed implementation methods to the Ministry for record.

2.  Regarding the establishment of vocational supplementary schools:

(1) All universities and specialized schools (hereinafter referred to as specialized schools) such as agriculture, industry, and commerce, vocational schools, rural normal schools, and middle schools and normal schools with special labor facilities should use their existing equipment and personnel to do their best to run various vocational supplementary schools that are of the same nature as the subjects offered by the school. (2) Universities and specialized schools should hold advanced vocational subject supplementary classes or short-term vocational training classes to provide in-depth subject supplementary classes for those who are already employed. (3) All vocational groups should cooperate with vocational schools and other equivalent schools, use the school's equipment to run vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes related to their industry. Those industries that have not organized groups should be urged to organize as soon as possible to carry out this undertaking. (4) Universities, specialized schools, and rural normal schools that run vocational supplementary education should be listed as extension undertakings. The number of classes run should be determined by the capacity of the school's equipment. The scope of the location is not limited to the school. (5) The subjects of vocational supplementary schools attached to schools at all levels should be of the same nature as the subjects offered by the school, and attention should be paid to the needs of the local area.

Women's vocational schools and women's middle schools and normal schools should run domestic science, childcare, sewing, and domestic service, and other subjects.

### Competition in Jinghua Primary School: The Strike Wave Expands, Authorities Closely Monitor

(Dahua News Agency) All faculty and staff of Jinghua Primary School on Haifang Road previously presented four demands to the school administration. After four weeks without a satisfactory response, they initiated a strike several days ago (the 30th), as reported by various newspapers. According to inquiries from a Dahua News Agency reporter, the school administration has intensified its pressure, exacerbating the situation. (1) Yesterday, primary school teacher Wang Shiwei witnessed students lingering on the street, with heavy traffic posing a danger. While advising the students to leave, he was suddenly attacked by middle school teacher Liang Zhishen, who, without inquiring into the circumstances, punched and kicked him, causing him to lose consciousness for three hours on the spot. (2) The school administration forcibly ordered male and female teachers residing on campus to vacate the premises within a specified time, threatening to use force otherwise. (3) The school administration engaged funeral parlor staff to mediate, but the proposed terms were too far apart, implementing purely coercive measures and demanding signatures by a certain time in the afternoon, threatening to hire new teachers otherwise. (4) The school administration deployed a large number of personnel to monitor the movements of faculty and staff, completely depriving them of their freedom. Currently, the faculty and staff are fighting for their rights based on reason. Furthermore, according to Dahua News Agency, educational personnel throughout the city expressed outrage upon hearing the news, unanimously condemning the school authorities for rejecting mediation initially and then daring to oppress the teachers subsequently, deeming it utterly inappropriate. It is reported that relevant authorities are still closely monitoring future developments to find a solution to the deadlock.

Another report states that Jinghua Middle and Primary School issued a statement yesterday, claiming that although a few members of the teachers' union instigated a strike at the private Jinghua Middle and Primary School on Haifang Road, all classrooms in the school continued to hold classes as usual yesterday (the 31st) because the other teachers were deeply aware of righteousness, complied with the school's measures, and attended classes as usual.

### Sino-Western Cup Table Tennis Women's Group: Jewish Team Wins Championship

The Sino-Western Cup women's group table tennis final was held at the Jewish Club on Muer Ming Road at 7:30 PM the night before last. Over a hundred guests attended, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Chen Linsheng, the executive chairman of the association, as well as committee members Di Fei, Liang Tang, Fulutuo, and Shasijin, all attended and presided over the event. The competitors were the defending champion Hualian and the third-place Jewish team from the previous year. The former boasted numerous fierce players and had defeated the talented Women's Youth team twice, with unmatched strength in Shanghai. The latter possessed the chop-block expert Mrs. Di Fei and the newcomer Miss Su Lun, but the overall team lineup was not yet complete. They had even succumbed to the Women's Youth team once last week. It was expected that the Jewish team would face an uphill battle tonight. Unexpectedly, after two hours of intense competition, Hualian lost due to Xu Haili and Xiao Weiqing's poor performance, losing every match and affecting the overall situation. Furthermore, Cai Xiuyu underestimated her opponent in the first game and was defeated by Ai Xuanjier. The forehand specialist Yan Wenjun was timid and lost a match she could have won. Considering the overall team, only the captain Miss Lin Jinlan performed exceptionally well. Her forehand shots were steady, accurate, and powerful, with near-perfect accuracy, making her difficult to defend against even for Jewish team's main player Mrs. Di Fei, resulting in a perfect record of five wins. This was truly commendable. In terms of skill, Hualian was superior, making this defeat regrettable. As a result, the Jewish team defeated Hualian by a score of 13 to 19, winning this year's championship. The Hualian team must wait until next year to avenge their defeat and should practice more diligently. We have high hopes for them. The results of both sides are recorded below:

### How to Study Zoology (3)

— Yuan Shanhui

(3) Occurrence of Life Phenomena

Animals ingest food and inhale air, undergoing gasification processes to decompose the food, converting the potential energy in the food into kinetic energy to stimulate various bodily activities and generating life phenomena.

(4) Individual Survival and Species Perpetuation

Animals ingest nutrients, increase physical strength, respond to external stimuli, and adapt to external environments to maintain individual survival. However, the lifespan of animals is limited, and death is inevitable. Therefore, after individual development and maturation, they separate a portion of the living substance from their bodies, forming a gamete to perpetuate the species.

(5) Animal Body Systems

A. Radial symmetry: The body has no anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, or left-right directions. From one end of the body, passing through the body axis to the other end, it can be divided into many equal halves.

B. Bilateral symmetry: Starting from the animal's mouth, along the dorsal-ventral center to the anus, there is only one plane that can divide the body into equal halves.

(6) Animal Body Structure

A. The cell is the basic unit that constitutes the animal body, divided into three parts: cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus.

B. Multicellular animals are composed of cells, tissues, organs, and systems.

C. Vertebrates have eight systems: digestive system, circulatory system, respiratory system, excretory system, reproductive system, skeletal system, muscular system, and nervous system.

(7) Metabolism

A. Nutritional substances combine with oxygen to generate kinetic energy.

B. Functions of the digestive, circulatory, respiratory, and excretory organs.

C. Phenomena of assimilation and dissimilation.

### Finance: Tight Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC exchange rates. In the black market, the British and American exchange rates were stable but slightly soft. Although Chinese speculators over-sold, HSBC and other foreign banks suddenly absorbed the supply, causing the US dollar rate of 5.40625 yuan to suddenly become difficult to settle, softening to 5.375 yuan. The British pound also hardened to 3 shillings 328125 pence, but the Hong Kong telegram rate settled back to 3 shillings 3125 pence, the same as the previous closing price. The US dollar was tighter by 0.03125 yuan, with thin trading. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

British Pound Unchanged

According to morning foreign exchange reports, during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, the British pound reported long, and the American and Indian silver markets were flat. Among the exchange rates of various countries, only the US dollar against Shanghai was slightly down by two points, with the rest flat. The opening price of the central exchange rate remained unchanged. The opening selling price of spot US dollars was still firm at 3 shillings 328125 pence, with the US dollar flat at 5.40625 yuan. Speculators initially bid at the same price but were unsuccessful. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax rose by half a point. After calculating the levy of 24.25 percent, speculators bid less on the June contract at 5.375 yuan, soon offsetting it at 5.40625 yuan, so it returned to being difficult to sell and settle. It was reported that HSBC absorbed the June contract at 5.40625 yuan. The Hong Kong telegram rate bid for the British pound at 3 shillings 3125 pence, signaling further softening. The spot rate to the June contract was all British pounds at 3 shillings 3125 pence and US dollars at 5.375 yuan, the same as the previous closing rate (29th). The British pound was flat, and the US dollar was tighter by 0.03125 yuan.

Hong Kong Dollar Rises

### Gold Market Firm, May Contract Settled and Squared

Yesterday's spot gold black market continued to be firm amid stability. Due to the softening of foreign exchange, remittance merchants Da Feng, Xin Feng, and Yong Chong came to sell short again, and the Guangdong group added to the positions, leading to an opening price of 6,405 yuan amid chaos, which once rose to 6,432 yuan. However, gold certificate groups then began to sell, and there were also rumors of sales by the Shanghai West group. The supply and demand situation turned balanced, and the price hovered around 6,420 yuan, eventually rising by 13 yuan. The half-day trading volume was 20,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. As of the end of the month yesterday, 14,220 taels of the May contract had not been settled and were settled and squared at 6,479.10 yuan, based on the HSBC small counter US dollar exchange rate of 5.375 yuan.

Xiangxing Yongfu sold 150 taels to Shihe and 80 taels to Bei Qingyun, both at 310 yuan higher. Bao Cheng Gongji sold 50 taels, all at 310 yuan higher. Shihe further bought 50 taels from Tongkang, 310 yuan higher, and 50 taels from Xiangxing Yongfu, 305 yuan higher, and finally 300 yuan higher. The fractional amount was offset. Customs gold and jewelry gold remained flat.

June Contract Up 13 Yuan

Since morning, the opening price of each June contract (10 taels) fluctuated several times under chaotic conditions, eventually settling at 6,405 yuan, 5 yuan lower than the previous closing price. Mei Da, Heng Ji, Cheng Ji, Xin Feng Yong, Da Feng, Shi He, and others aggressively bought, causing it to rise by 25 yuan to 6,430 yuan, which was then sold by Xiang He and De Cheng, pushing it back down to 6,415 yuan. The June US dollar was difficult to settle at 5.40625 yuan. Shi He, Heng Ji, and Xin Feng Yong then continued to buy, raising it by 17 yuan, and De Da advanced to 6,432 yuan. Soon, Shi He and Cheng Ji sold again, and De Fu also sold, hovering around 6,420 yuan, once falling back to 6,415 yuan. Xin Feng Yong and Heng Ji bought again, rising to 6,425 yuan, and Lian Xing sold. The midday closing price was 6,423 yuan, 13 yuan higher than the previous closing price. Settled at 6,479.10 yuan based on the June US dollar exchange rate of 5.375 yuan, a difference of 56.10 yuan. The fluctuation in the first half of the day was 27 yuan. After the close, it rose to 6,427-8 yuan. There was no trading outside the market in the afternoon due to Saturday. The selling price of gold from the gold shops was 310 yuan higher than the spot gold futures price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price.

### Food: Foreign Rice Arrives by Ship, One After Another, Rice Prices Fluctuate and Rebound

Foreign rice is arriving in Shanghai in succession. The French company has had three consecutive arrivals, all with foreign rice. The Tingkai ship, arriving yesterday morning, brought over 20,000 bags directly from Saigon, docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Today, the French ship G.G.A. Varenns, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived, also carrying 3,050 tons, or 30,500 bags, of rice from Saigon. The Java Company's Chisesdanny mail ship arrived the day before yesterday, carrying over 23,000 bags of corn from Java. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying 4,346 bags of corn from Hong Kong, docked at Jifu Wharf for unloading.

Prices first rose and then fell, and the market entered a state of fluctuation. The transaction of foreign rice is still active, with price fluctuations of two to three yuan. There are fewer futures transactions, with fluctuations of only around one yuan. Initially, it was hoped that there would be a large number of local customers making purchases after the festival, and mainland customers continued to inquire about prices in the market. The selling prices of various types of rice immediately gradually increased, rising by two to three yuan. Grade 1 Saigon rice rose to as high as 127 yuan, Grade 2 and Xiaojiao rice rose to 122 yuan, Mindang rice rose to 125-6 yuan, 砟 rice rose to 118 yuan, and broken rice rose to 97 yuan. However, as soon as the market price rose, actual sales slowed down, and profitable floating traders immediately sold. Moreover, in addition to the newly arrived foreign rice, including the French company's ships, with an import of 50,000 to 60,000 bags, there are two or three more ships arriving in succession. Hong Kong rice continues to be transported and sold to the public, and the third batch of tribute rice will also begin to be sold. Therefore, confidence returned, and prices immediately fell by one to two or three yuan. The final result is still close to the previous market closing price. The total transaction volume of current rice is 13,000 to 14,000 bags, with the British-Chinese company's transaction volume being 600 to 700 tons. Prices initially rose but weakened, with little net change. The spot price of Grade 1 Saigon rice is 146 yuan to 145 yuan, the April-May price is 146.5 yuan, the June price of Xiaojiao rice is 146 yuan, the April-May price is 140 yuan to 141.5 yuan, and the May price of broken rice is 107.5 yuan.

Economic Commentary
— Feng Liuxing

Price Statistics (2)

Unexpectedly, this training work inadvertently caused various newspapers to add special sections on commercial and financial news, unintentionally creating many correspondents who were both familiar with commercial information and capable of writing. This was indeed an unexpected gain for various newspapers. For example, the Commercial Newspaper, which first opened a commercial and financial news section in the Shanghai Chinese newspaper industry in January of the tenth year of the Republic of China, and the Economic News section of the Xinwen Newspaper, which followed suit in April of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, as well as the Commercial News section of the Shen Bao, the correspondents when they were first opened were mostly drawn from the investigators of the Price Investigation Office, and it is still feared that quite a few are still among them. Later, the commercial news of various newspapers all followed suit, establishing a separate field. Thus, people in various industries were influenced and learned from each other, and the number of people writing commercial articles gradually increased. This has its own considerable relationship to the progress of industrial and commercial culture, which is not known to recent people, so it is mentioned here.

Coincidentally, the Paris Peace Conference was held in the eighth year of the Republic of China, and Zhang Jizhi, as the leading figure in China's industrial sector, considered abandoning the opportunity to lift the restrictions of China's agreed tariff and gain tariff autonomy. He then contacted Shanghai merchants to organize a Tariff Equality Association, but did not dare to openly call for autonomy, for fear of offending merchants from various countries. However, in order to seek tariff autonomy, there must be a self-determined tariff, preceded by a self-conducted investigation of cargo prices. In this way, the newly established Cargo Price Investigation Office suddenly attracted the attention of large merchants in Shanghai. However, various countries who had already gained economic benefits in China were unwilling to give them up easily, especially in the era of warlords, who were even less likely to pay attention to them. Therefore, although there was a representative who went to Europe to prepare to present something to the Peace Conference, it ultimately returned without result. At that time, the business community did not know the importance of tariff autonomy, and some even wanted to take advantage of the low import tax rates to facilitate profit-seeking; therefore, the work of the Cargo Price Investigation Office was no longer valued by the industrial and commercial sectors.

Initially, the investigation was limited to the imported foreign goods, converting all kinds of trading units into dan and converting them into Customs Taels. Under the conditions of an inexperienced investigative work, this was naturally very difficult, as it required opening up a road for work. After completing the monthly compilation and reporting quarterly to the Ministry of Finance, the revised tariff in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, still headed by Cai Tinggan, adopted this price as the basis for calculating tariffs. However, foreigners still said that it was not publicized at ordinary times, so in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, they began to compile and publish a quarterly Chinese and English cargo price, followed by a monthly price report, along with conducting commodity surveys and industry surveys. This survey is still advocated today, but it is not known that the Cargo Price Investigation Office was already working on it at that time.

The term "Index Number" was translated by the Japanese. It was originally unseen in China, but in fact, it is not difficult to explain in terms of the meaning of the word. Whenever there is a place that needs to be indicated, a hand is drawn holding a fist, with one finger pointing as an indication, and below it may be attached with words such as "Enter Here" or "Turn Here". This index finger, which holds a fist and points straight, is what is called an Index, containing the meaning of indication. Therefore, an index is a group of numbers that take a little bit of compilation work to become one or several numbers to indicate its trend of ups and downs, so that it is easy to compare and observe! In other words, this is the number that indicates whether the price "is high because of this" or "is small because of this". I do not want to talk about the definitions of indexes here, but for the sake of understanding by the general readers, I will use metaphors to prepare for one explanation!

China's price index began in September of the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919) with the Shanghai Wholesale Price Index of the Cargo Price Investigation Office. Because the investigation was accurate and the compilation was detailed, the statistical publications of various countries soon contained the words "China" or "Shanghai", which is also the glory of China's academic community. The office also compiled and issued an import and export price index in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China; and in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the first cost of living index in Shanghai was also published.

Following the Cargo Price Investigation Office, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau was responsible for statistical work. Each department of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau has statistics, such as public welfare and charitable undertakings, industry and commerce, and labor affairs. What is mentioned here is only the workers' cost of living index compiled by the labor department. Cai Zhengya presided over this and first conducted a family budget survey of workers, followed by compiling an index, which was published in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China.

Since the outbreak of the August 13 Incident, various indexes have been suspended one after another due to the relationship of the compilation agencies, which is a pity. The International Labour Office still needs the Shanghai workers' cost of living index, and Shanghai society has never been without this need. Therefore, the Shanghai branch of the China Statistical Society came out to plan, not to cause the workers' cost of living index to be interrupted due to the temporary situation. It reluctantly raised part of the survey expenses, and Cai Zheng continued to be responsible for the compilation. Soon, the funds ran out, and the Shanghai Municipal Council maintained it with the strength of a certain four people, which is also called the Shanghai Municipal Council Workers' Cost of Living Index by various newspapers. However, the base period has been changed from the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926) to the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China (that is, 1936, the year before the Shanghai war) as the standard.

China's price index originated in Shanghai; and Tianjin's price index began with He Lian. He returned to China from studying statistics with Professor Fisher in the United States and arrived in Shanghai in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. After that, he went to Nankai University as a professor, and then Tianjin began to have a price index in the world. Since then, although the compilation of price indexes in various provinces and cities has been carried out and stopped, there must be no less than thirty or forty kinds, but only more than a dozen kinds have continued to be compiled, and most of them are probably in suspension today.

Although I have never peeped into the doorway of statistics, I am also secretly happy to sort out the numbers and make simple statistics to help explain things. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, I compiled a foreign exchange index by month based on the foreign exchange since the beginning of the Republic of China, up to the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, which was published in the New Year's Day supplement of the Commercial Newspaper in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. Now the original manuscript is lost, and the Commercial Newspaper also ceased publication at the end of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, and the old newspaper cannot be retrieved.

Before China compiled its own price index, foreigners such as the Englishman Wetmore and the Japanese Currency System Committee had compiled Chinese price indexes, but the source of their prices was probably only within the scope of trade books. Now, the methods of compiling indexes are progressing very rapidly, with different categories and different methods. It has become a specialized subject, which cannot be compared with the simple compilation of the past. Recently, the classification methods of the cost of living index have also tended to change from the current five categories (namely, food, clothing, rent, fuel, and miscellaneous) to four categories (namely, food, housing, clothing, and miscellaneous). When this decisive battle is over, all economic organizations will undergo tremendous changes, and since the price index is a manifestation of economic life, how can there be no reason to reform it! (The End)

Corrigendum: The difficulty of proofreading is like sweeping fallen leaves. Unexpectedly, there are errors in the original manuscript in this article that have been reversed, such as "foreign goods originally wanted to be sold in China, which is beneficial to light taxes" and mistakenly written as "which is beneficial to heavy taxes", which was not proofread. In addition, errors such as "conceal" being mistakenly written as "蕴瞒" are minor. Other errors, if they can be understood, will not be corrected.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Fresh Green Broad Beans Hit the Market

Fresh green broad beans, favored by the recent sunny weather, are arriving on the market in sequence. This year, due to changing circumstances, the Nanxiang (Minhang area) supply has yet to reach the market. For the past two days, the supply has come from the Beigang (Maojiashi area), numbering around 200 bags. The quality is higher than last year, and the selling price is also sharply higher, almost double. (On May 31st of the tenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1921], the first batch of green broad beans from Nanxiang, Minhang, was priced at 19.5 yuan; the second batch on June 1st opened at 19 yuan; on June 3rd, the first batch of green broad beans from Beigang, Maojiashi, was priced at 20.08 yuan, and the second batch ranged from 20 yuan to 19.5 yuan.) The opening price is 42 yuan to 42.2 yuan, purchased by the Hong Kong group and local traders. Subsequent batches, under these special circumstances, are likely to rise further, with little chance of falling.

Yesterday, 1,488 bags of tea beans arrived from Tianjin. On June 2nd, 724 bags of beans, 2,000 pieces of bean cake, and 250 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.

### New Wheat Samples Arrive; Flour Sales Showing Signs of Activity

Flour: Yesterday's market was particularly firm, likely due to increasing sales both north and south. Suppliers were reluctant to release stock, making it difficult to buy. The general market price for "Pao Tai" brand American flour opened at 30.035 yuan, "Jin Long" flour at 29.9 yuan, and "Hua Niao" brand at 30.05 yuan. Transactions amounted to a strong 10,000 bags, and the market consensus was stable and firm.

Wheat: Yesterday's market was as quiet as usual, as old wheat had already been cleared and new wheat had not yet arrived. Factories had not yet begun sourcing raw materials, and buying and selling were in a period of clearing accounts, with trading largely suspended.

New Wheat: New wheat has already appeared in the Xisu (Wuxi and Suzhou) area and will soon be officially weighed and priced. Samples have also been sent to Shanghai, and the quality is similar to last year, but the harvest is estimated to be only 80% of last year's.

### Securities: Bond Market Shows Mixed Performance

Government Bonds (unofficial market): Yesterday's market, being a Saturday, saw only half-day trading. Prices showed mixed performance, with no uniformity. Different participants took different positions, resulting in fluctuations. The overall trend was still upward. Xinfu and Hengkang were actively buying, Defu exclusively bought Ding bonds, and Tongkang Lianyi sold Ding bonds. Supply was limited, so the price increased significantly. The remaining bonds fluctuated by only 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Transactions totaled 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 30 shares of the Home Industries Cooperative were traded at 95 yuan per share.

London: May 30th (Friday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British company stocks saw slight increases. Chinese government bonds, including the British-issued Reorganization Loan, rose 1 pound to 31 pounds. British shares of HSBC Hong Kong registered stock rose 1 pound to 79 pounds. Chartered Bank shares rose 2 shillings and 6 pence to 11 pounds, 2 shillings, and 6 pence. There were no other changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Shuang Ma Factory Inventory Depleted; New Shorts Hesitant

The yarn market remains calm, but actual trading is still holding, so sentiment is stable. However, some in the market say that a large number of foreign client orders have been mostly cleared, leading to a mediocre trend. As for shorts, they dare not take aggressive action because the factory order supply is depleted and they suffered significant losses last time. Thus, the market is in a state of hesitation. The fundamental issue is that real sales continue, and with factories' production costs increasing, market prices naturally cannot fall significantly. The high price for 20-count "Shuang Ma" yarn was 1,445 yuan, and the low price was 1,434 yuan. No transactions were reported in the afternoon due to the weekend. Tomorrow, 2,400 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong.

The opening market for "Shuang Ma" yarn was peaceful, with the first trade at 1,440 yuan, rising slightly to 1,445 yuan. The bidding market was also ordinary. Foreign exchange rates showed no major changes. Major players generally adopted a cautious attitude, and activity was limited, making trading very quiet. Those who profited midway sold, pushing the price down to 1,434 yuan. With the price low, it is said that some foreign clients bought in slightly, and at the same time, bids increased, pushing the price back up to 1,445 yuan. However, new buyers were not eager, and the price lingered around 1,440 yuan for a long time. The closing price was flat at 1,437 yuan. According to statistics, 7,600 bales were traded during the half-day, with Hong Kong interests accounting for 600 bales and domestic interests accounting for 7,000 bales.

### Cotton Cloth Still Good

The current cotton situation is generally firm, as yarn sales are more active compared to rice. It is expected that factories may intend to replenish their raw material supplies, which is boosting confidence. The public is still optimistic about the prospects for fine cotton. Tomorrow, 270 bales of cotton will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Rice Medlin 428.5 Brand: 200 pieces, delivered from the warehouse.

Rice Medlin 428 Brand: 100 pieces, delivered from the warehouse.

Printed NT 385 Brand: 100 pieces, delivered from the warehouse.

In other news, the foreign cotton market in Shanghai is quiet but firm. At the same time, due to continued caution from various parties, transactions are scarce.

The New York cotton market rose due to climate reports favorable to bulls. At the same time, it fell due to some profit-taking and the impact of the Balkan Crete Island war. As a result, the closing price was down 12-13 points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering, but later fell due to weaker overseas markets and the European war. Yesterday's closing prices were down 3-4 rupees across the board.

It is predicted that today's opening market will be fairly flat, similar to the closing prices.

### Piece Goods: Both Spot and Futures Cloth Prices Fall

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was quiet, with dealers and hoarders in a pessimistic mood. Overall cloth prices were low. However, some goods with actual sales saw price increases. As a result, white cloth, fine cloth, and twill fell 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. Ewo 9-pound and 13-pound coarse cloth rose 0.25 yuan. Heavy coarse cloth was flat. Bleached and dyed cloth also saw slight declines. Wooden Street transactions involved 100+ pieces of various cloths. The Nanyang group continued to handle 150-160 pieces of Ewo 9, 11, and 13-pound coarse cloth, and 100+ pieces of colored cloth, twill, etc. The Guangdong-Hong Kong group handled 100+ pieces of twill and colored twill. Tomorrow, 2,065 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Dong Cloth: Customer sales are as stagnant as usual, and sentiment is weak. The Exchange's tendered cloth for June fell 0.6 yuan, and the July contract fell 0.79 yuan. The spot market was even more sluggish. "Longtou" fine cloth opened in the morning at 44.1 yuan, and closed at 44 yuan, down 0.6 yuan. The "Four Gentlemen" small jacquard dyed cloth was priced at 1.4025 yuan, and closed slightly higher at 1.41 yuan, also down 0.01 yuan per yard.

### Sugar Market: Futures Bullishness Showing Weakness; One Firm Stranded

Yesterday's sugar market was very weak, with both spot and futures prices falling nearly 100 yuan. In addition, one firm in the Xinghua group with weak capital was stranded. This is the first case of bankruptcy after sugar became a speculative commodity. Although the amount is only around 20,000 yuan, the future needs to be watched carefully. The guild's listed price for spot second-grade white sugar arriving on May 14th was 98.5-98.65 yuan, and that arriving on May 30th was 99.5 yuan. The June futures market opened soft and flat at 101-100 yuan, then fell to 99.9-98.6 yuan, down 2.9 yuan. Jardine Matheson’s Taikoo Beet White B mark, arrived February, East Bund stock, was 104.5 yuan, a decline near significant. HX mark East Bund stock was 94.8 yuan, with little change. Yesterday, 36,000 bags of sugar arrived from Java and 2,255 bags of white sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### North and South Goods: Seasoned Vegetables Decline

Seasoned vegetables were previously priced up to a high of 130 yuan due to shortages. Now, it is reported that a larger amount of goods is on the way, so the market has eased. Yesterday, the market price had already retreated to 120 yuan, down 20 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Sophora Root Seed Price High

Sophora root seeds have been scarce recently, and the supply is tight. According to letters from Hong Kong, the production price is very high, requiring 140 yuan. The Shanghai market is currently selling at 120 yuan, still 20 yuan below. If the Tianjin group's sales become active, prices are expected to rise immediately.

### Coal: Smoked Coal Down 10 Yuan

The price of smoked coal has fallen recently because a large quantity of coke has flooded the market. The smoked coal from the local coal shops is gradually becoming available. As a result, the market has begun to ease. Hoarders are selling, but buyers are not eager, and the unofficial price has declined slightly. Yesterday, the intra-industry break price for lump coal was 430 yuan per ton, down 10 yuan from the previous market, and the downward trend is expected to continue.

### Imports and Exports: Imports of Hardware and Sundries

On the 31st, 460 pieces of rattan, 232 pieces of cowhide, 807 pieces of paint, 388 pieces of iron sheet, and 1,042 bags of zinc powder arrived from Hong Kong.

### Who Is the Next Edison?

— Yang Chunlu

Edison, a great American inventor, is known to everyone and admired by all.

He invented over a thousand different things in his lifetime. The happiness he gave to people will be forever praised.

However, he was not born special. When he was young, he enjoyed playing as much as you do, but he also liked to study science, paying attention to new things at all times, constantly asking questions and getting to the bottom of things. He often experimented himself, and sometimes the experiments failed, but he was not discouraged and continued to try again and again until he succeeded. Therefore, his great achievements were entirely the result of his own hard work. He often said to people, "My achievements all come from hard work and effort."

Dear children! When you enjoy the things he invented, how should you admire him and emulate him? Children! As long as you cultivate a scientific mindset now, use your clever minds to explore nature, and use your capable hands to engage in scientific experiments, then you will be the next Edison!

### Superstitions of the Dragon Boat Festival

— Lin Ren

Time flies so quickly; spring has quietly passed, and summer has arrived. The Dragon Boat Festival is a rather noticeable event in early summer. Fruit shops are piled high with golden loquats, and tea shops display all kinds of zongzi (rice dumplings). Leaves resembling wild grass hang in front of neighboring doors, with garlic attached. All these things appearing on the Dragon Boat Festival day in A Liang's simple mind, he doesn't know why.

"Okay, I'll tell you one by one?" When A Liang's father saw A Liang's puzzled expression, he said to him like this. Of course, A Liang was overjoyed when he heard that his father was willing to explain everything to him. He quietly waited for his father to open his mouth.

"The origin of zongzi is said to be in the ancient state of Chu in our country, there was a great poet named Qu Yuan, who everyone knew at that time. One day, he committed suicide by throwing himself into the Miluo River because he was worried about the country. Therefore, the local people wrapped zongzi to commemorate him. The day Qu Yuan jumped into the river was exactly the fifth day of the fifth month, so eating zongzi on the Dragon Boat Festival has the meaning of commemorating Qu Yuan. This thing is still somewhat meaningful. And the most superstitious is the legend of eliminating the five poisonous creatures—snakes, centipedes, spiders, geckos, and toads—on the Dragon Boat Festival. What is used to eliminate them? It is the artemisia, calamus, and garlic hung on the door because calamus is like a sword that can kill them; while artemisia and garlic have a pungent smell that can be used to scare them away. Do you think this kind of thinking is naive and ridiculous? Even more, at noon that day, people drink realgar wine, which is said to detoxify snake bites and insect stings. The most boring thing is to dress up children in strange costumes, wearing fire-yellow clothes printed with tigers, and fire-yellow shoes and socks on their feet. The shoes are even embroidered with tiger whiskers, ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. A string woven with camphor bags, yellow tigers, riding figures, and horn zongzi is hung on the buttons, which is said to have the effect of suppressing evil. The character 'king' is drawn on the forehead with realgar to detoxify. At noon, mosquito coils are burned in every room, so that the traces of poisonous insects can be eliminated. The Dragon Boat Festival is the time when fire-yellow color is most prominent. Even the food eaten is chosen to be yellow, so loquats, yellow croaker, cucumbers, and yellow eels must be eaten that day. Some are yellow in color, and some only have the name without the substance. Thinking about these things carefully, even fools would not do them, but now they are being moved and handled one by one by people who consider themselves smart. These are all meaningless and superstitious things. Moreover, there is still the custom of giving gifts on the Dragon Boat Festival. Given the current high cost of living, gifts are really unaffordable. A simple gesture costs dozens of yuan. Besides, sending gifts back and forth still results in everyone eating their own food, a pointless waste of money. Then why bother? There is also the legend of the White Snake, in which the White Snake reveals her true form on the Dragon Boat Festival. This is even more vulgar and disgusting nonsense. Could there really be such stupid things in the world? It really should be banned. So this Dragon Boat Festival is truly full of smog and foul air. However, we should purify our minds and abolish these unreasonable and superstitious actions one by one. This is a meaningful task that modern children should do." A Liang felt that this was very true after listening to these words, so he wanted to explain it to his relatives one by one to break the various superstitions of the Dragon Boat Festival.

### Little Angels Overseas

— Xin Fang

Children! Don't you often like to listen to people telling stories or jokes? Now I have a very interesting thing to tell you all.

In New York, in the United States, there is a girl named Reidie Hanson who is only two years old. However, her monthly income exceeds the salary of her father as a middle school science teacher, and she already has a huge sum of money in the bank. Children must be asking me, where does she get so much income from? It turns out that since this little angel was two months old, her photos have been used as cover material by some magazines, and some have been published in newspapers as advertising promotions. In fact, it is because her face is so beautiful, and she looks even more moving after being photographed. So until today, almost all the larger magazines or newspapers published in the United States can have her photos found. Of course, her photos cannot be taken arbitrarily. First, the consent of her parents must be obtained, and secondly, if it is used for promotion, some remuneration must be given to this little angel. Recently, the average weekly remuneration she receives is at least sixty or seventy US dollars. The most interesting thing is that she refuses to have crying photos taken, but she likes to sleep in front of the camera the most.

Children! Do you all feel envious of this little angel?

### Spanking the Palm

— He Yichang

The room I live in faces the window of a small school next door. That window is a classroom. Every day, the sound of students reading, singing, and making noise fills my ears. Sometimes, there is a special sound of slapping, which is 'spanking the palm.' Then there is the teacher's scolding and the students' crying, all mixed together. This kind of sound can be heard every day. Sometimes it continues incessantly, one after another. Although I am used to hearing it, I always feel a strange feeling in my heart, often sighing: 'Children, why are you getting beaten? Why does your good flesh have to suffer such pain?' According to educational principles, 'corporal punishment' is prohibited in schools. Spanking the palm is also a kind of corporal punishment. But according to some teachers, elementary school students are always mischievous, and in some places, they simply cannot be successful without beating. Therefore, corporal punishment is common in almost all elementary schools. And spanking the palm has become the most common corporal punishment.

Children, if you are subjected to this kind of corporal punishment, you should also reflect on yourselves and learn from the pain. What is the reason for suffering this pain? In my opinion, there are about two reasons: First, not listening to instructions. Unwilling to study diligently, forgetting what has been taught, and failing to submit prepared assignments on time. Second, not following the rules. Flippant and glib, often teasing and fighting with classmates. Or damaging other people's books, or stealing other people's items. If you commit any of the above problems, of course you are qualified to be beaten. Therefore, children, whether in school or at home, you must obey instructions and follow the rules. Every day, you must ask yourselves, have I done anything wrong today? If you have, then correct it; if you haven't, then continue to strive.' Then the 'ruler' placed on the teacher's desk, although it hits people at every turn, I am afraid it will have no way to use its skills, and there will be 'no place to display its strength.'

### Three Ordinary Questions

— Ren Qing

"First, why can we only see the air we exhale when it's cold?"

The air we exhale from our lungs is always the same temperature; but the change in the outside air is very large. When the weather is cold, the temperature of the air we exhale is higher than the temperature of the outside air, so as soon as it leaves our body and suddenly encounters cold, it will condense into a piece of water and become a light mist. What we see is this light mist. As for when the weather is too warm, the temperature of the outside air is high, and it does not affect the water vapor inside the air we exhale, so we cannot see it.

"Second, why do we seem to see red light when we close our eyes?"

This question is very wonderful and interesting. Our eyes are slightly transparent. They cannot stop the external light from penetrating into the eyes. When we close our eyes and look at the light, the light that passes through the eyes passes through the red blood that is always in our eyes. The red blood will retain other light and only let the red light shine in, so we see a red light.

"Third, why can't we sleep with our eyes open?"

When we are sleeping, can we lift our hands in the air? We can't! What is the reason? That is the same as the reason why we cannot sleep with our eyes open, which I am about to talk about. We sleep to rest our strength. Our eyes are also exerting force when they are open. So when it's time to sleep, our eyelids droop down due to their own weight. In other words, they are resting. Therefore, we will definitely close our eyes when we sleep!

Entertainment World

### The British National Entertainments Service Association

— Yangzijiang

Since the outbreak of the war, Britain has been actively promoting war propaganda. Three days after Britain declared war, the "National Entertainments Service Association" was established. This is an organization in which people from all sectors of the entertainment industry in the UK - including drama, film, singing, and music - engage in wartime service.

Since its establishment, the National Entertainments Service Association has performed 10,000 shows both domestically and internationally within a year, reaching a total audience of 7 million people. It has also performed 5,538 shows in France, entertaining 2,241,550 soldiers. The association mobilized famous British playwrights, stars, and singers, with their footprints reaching as far north as Iceland, as far east as Cairo, as far west as coastal areas, and as far south as British South Africa.

In August of last year, they also received an order from the Minister of Labor to work in munitions factories across the country, having provided entertainment to munitions workers in places such as Meng Queqi and other places, performing 3,000 shows. This has had a significant and superior impact on regulating the lives of workers and increasing production quantities.

Since London has been constantly subjected to air raids, they have begun to be active in air-raid shelters, opening many concerts in the trenches during alarms.

This is a performance of the achievements of Chinese wartime artists serving the country.

### "Ode to Uprightness" Prelude

— Ru Bing

In order to increase the creative interest of young playwrights, to encourage the production of great plays, and to make up for the shortage of scripts, the Shanghai Theatre Society launched a "Script Bonus" campaign, and the situation has been quite enthusiastic. As a result of the judging, Mr. Wu Zuguang's "Ode to Uprightness" (i.e., Wen Tianxiang) won the first prize. Playwright Wu Zuguang is currently teaching at the Chongqing Drama School. It is said that he spent two years writing this script, which shows his serious attitude toward writing.

The past "The Great Ming Heroes," "Li Xiuyu Dies for His Country," "Yi Ge Nennang," and the recently staged "Hong Xuanjiao" at the Carlton, all made people feel refreshed. The stories of loyalty, courage, tragedy, generosity, and enthusiasm are indeed too touching. In the "Ode to Uprightness," there will be even more exciting and lovely performances.

The writing of "Ode to Uprightness" is very novel. The play has four acts and ten scenes in total. The story begins with an old man narrating the life of Wen Tianxiang's loyalty and fighting spirit to his grandson, and then uses the昏庸 and the corruption of奸佞 in the dynasty as a foil. There are more than 100 actors, including all the basic and special actors, on stage, and at the same time, one person plays two roles. The cost of staging this play by the Yishe Theatre Society is not small. The performance fee alone has cost 10,000 yuan. In other aspects, whether it is in actors, scenery, or props, it exceeds the record of "Home."

The date is from the evening performance on June 4th, and only evening performances will be held every day after that. On holidays, there will be two performances, day and night, or "Tears Splattered on Flowers" and "Parasitic Grass" will be performed during the day.

For this play "Ode to Uprightness," I would like to sincerely recommend it to all those who love drama.

Chen Yunshang Moves

Chen Yunshang recently moved from the Ziuming Apartments on Julu Road to No. 318 Fergusson Road, Juerdian Road, because the old residence was not enough. The new apartment was found for her by her sister Li Minghui and others. The house is very spacious and has a small garden, and the scenery is quite beautiful.

Chapter 10: Gongsun's Sword Energy, Part One

Xu Jing was once again stunned by Wang Yongtai's words. How could the old man have already known that he had secretly come here to expose their adulterous affair? Strange, strange, strange! He had no choice but to clasp his hands and say, "Little one knows that this action was impulsive, and I did not inform my uncle before acting. I beg your forgiveness, old sir. It is only because your nephew suffered an unjust grievance before, and I saw no opportunity to defend myself before my uncle. Furthermore, I have long observed the ambiguous relationship between these two, so I came here tonight specifically to capture them both, then to seek forgiveness from my uncle and explain the reasons. Firstly, to make my uncle understand my grievance, and secondly, to eliminate future concerns for my uncle. Uncle is wise and understanding and will surely be able to appreciate my actions." Wang Yongtai listened, nodding. He walked to the two of them, and seeing their filthy and sordid state, he felt anger rising within him, his beard bristling. He shouted, "Bitch! What a good thing you've done! Spreading false accusations and slander against good people in my presence, turning me against my virtuous nephew Xu, causing me to bear the blame for misjudgment. Today, you pair of adulterous dogs, how can you face me?" Xu Jing, standing beside him, also said to He, "Sooner or later, the truth of the matter will come to light. You can now explain clearly to my uncle whether I came to seduce you or you came to entice me? I, Xu Jing, am an upright man, who would ever do such beastly things as you do?" Wang Yongtai also kicked his foot out, swiftly drawing a bright, sharp dagger from his bosom, pointing it at He Ji, and sternly said, "Bitch, confess quickly! Can you still try to argue?" He Ji, with tears streaming down her face, said, "This matter is truly my fault, because I failed to seduce Young Master Xu, and I feared he would expose my wrongdoing to you, so that night I deliberately fabricated events and falsely accused him. It was truly a moment of madness. I know I am not worthy to be your concubine, my lord. I beg you to consider the affection of the past few years and spare my dog's life, let me go back, and I will never forget your great kindness." Then she recounted how she had tried to seduce Xu Jing and how she deliberately left behind the handkerchief. Wang Yongtai gritted his teeth and said, "If it weren't for my virtuous nephew exposing your secret tonight, wouldn't I still be in the dark? Alas! The shame within the household is difficult to speak of. My old face of Wang Yongtai has been completely disgraced by you. "He also yelled at Sang Yiqing, "Dog thief! I have treated you well, yet I never expected you to be a beast in human clothing, ungrateful and treacherous, colluding with this harlot. Is your flesh still fit to eat? What do you have to say?" (Seven or eight)

### Abstract of the Philosophy of Diligence

— Zong Yu

The labor of many people is commodified, as if labor is my commodity, a commodity has a certain value, and society, for the sake of need, buys my labor. I exchange labor for a price. This kind of labor is absolutely not service.
