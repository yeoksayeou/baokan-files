### Expanding US Aid to China: Assisting China in Strengthening its Air Force

Supplying Ships to Transport War Materials to Rangoon: Publication of US Lend-Lease Act Progress Report

United Press International, Washington, 16th: President Roosevelt stated in his Lend-Lease Act report to Congress yesterday that the largest task in the program is to aid China and Britain. In the chapter on "Scope of Lend-Lease Act Aid," it states that the purpose of the Lend-Lease Act is to "improve, extend, and secure the routes for transporting war materials to China." The President stated that the US Maritime Commission has supplied cargo ships to China and transported goods to Rangoon, as this is the only major import route to free China. President Roosevelt stated that basic steps have been implemented to maintain China's land transportation. He proposed transporting road-building materials for the Burma Road. He said that aid for the Chinese highway truck project under the Lend-Lease Act is increasing daily. The report also mentioned that gasoline, oil, and truck parts have been shipped to China. The report also stated that the Burma Road was built with unlimited manpower and received initial assistance. Now, the railway is being extended to Yunnan Province, a malarial area, but the US Public Health Service is taking care of the workers' health problems there. The President also stated that in order to protect China's highways, railways, airfields, and cities from repeated bombings, modern fighter planes are urgently needed. Therefore, over the past year, Lend-Lease Act contracts have been signed to transport aircraft and other aircraft components to China. President Roosevelt stated that a military mission has departed for China to confer with Chinese military authorities. The mission will also determine the war tools most suitable for China, which can enable China to achieve maximum war effectiveness.

Aid to Resist Aggression: Twelve Countries Receive Assistance

Reuters, Washington, 16th: President Roosevelt reported to Congress yesterday that the supplies delivered under the US Lend-Lease program to countries resisting the Axis powers totaled $190,447,670 as of the end of August. However, the supplies already transferred, including those currently awaiting shipment, still amount to $35,946,701, and other services such as repairing warships have also reached $78,169,377. The cost of service equipment not yet completed still reaches $162,000,000. The value of defense equipment already transferred and defense services already provided in August, plus the cost of other Lend-Lease uses, totals US$487,000,000. Aircraft, tanks, artillery, and ships are now beginning to flow out of American factories, and this outflow will increase daily until it accumulates into rivers and seas, sweeping away the totalitarianism that seeks to dominate the world. Most of these supplies are shipped to Britain, but approximately twelve countries have received American aid, including China, Poland, Greece, Yugoslavia, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands (including the Dutch East Indies), Brazil, and the Dominican Republic. The President also stated that this is not a matter of charity or sympathy. We are making this contribution because we know that resisting aggression alone will lead to failure. To break the brutal war machine that is now ravaging Europe, we must rely on the united efforts of all free people in all places where aggressors can be attacked, otherwise it will not work. Goods under the Lend-Lease program are shipped as quickly as possible when they are available for export. Including what Britain has funded itself, Britain has actually received goods worth approximately $4,400,000,000 since the outbreak of the war. However, the US production rate must be accelerated, and we must take all kinds of steps to achieve this goal. Part of the funds under the Lend-Lease program have been allocated for the construction of naval and land bases for Britain, amounting to approximately $12,000,000. Bombers that have been ordered and started construction are worth approximately $1,000,000,000. Aircraft and aircraft parts account for more than one-third of all war equipment ordered under the Lend-Lease program. The United States has supplied China with many trucks, cargo ships for transporting war materials, and raw materials for repairing the Yunnan-Burma Road. Equipment and supplies under the Lend-Lease program are also helping the Yunnan Railway, and new fighter planes will strengthen the Chinese Air Force under the Lend-Lease Act contracts established in the past three months. In addition, other countries that have received assistance include: (1) Poland: guns, ammunition, clothing, and self-defense equipment for merchant ships; (2) Greece: new equipment for Greek troops who fled to British territory in the Middle East; (3) Yugoslavia: naval and land equipment for the Southern Army in the Middle East; (4) Norway: mine protection, anti-aircraft guns, and submarine artillery required for merchant ships, as well as repairs for damaged ships; (5) Belgium: reconnaissance vehicles, machine guns, aircraft, and hospital equipment required for the Belgian Congo and the Free Belgian Army; (6) The Netherlands: military weapons, gunpowder, aircraft, warships, tanks, and commodities required for the Dutch East Indies.

Destroying Nazi Forces: Decision to Expand Aid to the Soviet Union

United Press International, Washington, 16th: All of the President's statements are described in a letter to Vice President and Senate President Wallace and Rayburn. The letter stated that Britain has received a large amount of aid from our country, but other countries resisting aggression have also received aid from our country. The President stated that our program of assisting China and the Dutch East Indies is gradually increasing. Governments of countries expelled by the Nazis and countries in the Southern Hemisphere are also eligible for the Lend-Lease Act. The President's letter also stated that the Soviet people's brave resistance has provided great assistance to the people resisting the Nazis. It also stated, "We have done our best to supply the Soviet Union's needs with possible items. The Soviet Union's resistance is like resisting for the United States. We are aiding the Soviet Union because gradual resistance is bound to fail. The inhumane war to control Europe can only be fought with the combined forces of all free people." The President also stated, "Construction contracts for bombers worth US$100,000,000 have been signed, and work will begin in a short period of time. New methods of building merchant ships have begun, and new merchant ships worth $500,000,000 are under construction." It continued, "New methods to increase the speed of guns, ammunition, and other defense items have begun, and contracts worth a total of US$262,000,000 have been signed." It also stated that "the Soviet Union's purchases here are made by its regular purchasing agencies with its own funds." The letter also stated, "The American people know that we cannot survive in a world under the control of Hitlerism. They know that unless this evil force is destroyed, we cannot have true peace and security." The President's letter also stated that the Lend-Lease Act is not a one-sided effort included in our country's defense or armament. This is the entire essence of our country's efforts to preserve national comfort and eliminate those who disrupt our peace for future generations. The United States is now included in the largest and most effective industrial country in history. We will do our best to create a war industry. This is the only way we can build our arsenal of democracy.

Close Cooperation Between Britain and the United States: Maintaining Maritime Traffic

In addition to his report to Congress, the President attached a letter stating that the United States has chartered a large number of cargo ships and oil tankers for the use of countries whose defense is closely related to US national defense. US shipyards are also repairing damaged merchant ships for the Allied countries. The United States is also installing equipment to defend against mines, aircraft, submarines, and raiding ships on Allied ships. It is also repairing and equipping Allied warships. In addition, it is helping the British and Allied navies clear necessary sea lanes. The repair of the British battleship "Malaya" and the aircraft carrier "Illustrious" is one of the proofs of naval assistance. The United States is also providing Britain and other countries resisting the Axis powers with important defense information. The transatlantic business of American aircraft, spanning the Americas and Africa, is now connecting American arsenals and civilized countries with outposts in the Middle East. Thousands of British pilots are currently receiving training at American airfields. We are now preparing a similar program to assist China. The defense of the Western Hemisphere is the first consideration of the Lend-Lease program. We are not only assisting European countries resisting the Nazis to prevent them from advancing to the Western Hemisphere, but we are also strengthening Iceland's defense to provide direct Lend-Lease assistance to countries in the Western Hemisphere. We have begun a large-scale program to provide material assistance to countries in Central and South America to strengthen common defense (Reuters).

US Goods Transported to China: Tax Exemption for Goods Passing Through Burma

United Press International, Washington, 16th: Republican Senator Vandenberg of Michigan publicly released a letter from the Secretary of State yesterday, stating that freight transported via the Burma-Yunnan Highway under the Lend-Lease Act is now tax-exempt. Vandenberg said that the letter was in response to his question. Hull said that before August 27, such freight should be taxed, and after August 27, a transit tax of ten rupees (East Indian silver coins) per ton would be charged. Hull's letter stated, "Our embassy in London reported on September 7 that the British Foreign Office has notified that all US Lend-Lease goods transported to China are exempt from transit tax after being unloaded in Rangoon on September 3."

Editorial

### On US-Japan Negotiations

Given Japan's current international situation, it not only welcomes negotiations with the United States, but also hopes to achieve its own goals through a strategy of divide and conquer with any of the countries in the Far East anti-aggression front, such as China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. Therefore, fundamentally, it has to insist on two points: first, the opponent must be individual, and second, the negotiation object must be partial. It not only opposes attending the collective meetings of anti-aggression countries and accepting everyone's condemnation of it; at the same time, even if any country in the anti-aggression front wants to make Japan accept its views on the entire Far East situation, it is probably completely impossible. In short, Japan's intention to engage in negotiations with the United States is still to use the usual individual break-through technique, attempting to first ease the crisis with the United States, wait for the appropriate time, and then arrange a major attack on any part of the anti-aggression front. This point is beyond any doubt.

What inevitably raises considerable questions is the US side. The first is the issue of motivation. If the United States' intention to engage in negotiations with Japan is to resolve the entire chaotic situation in the Far East in one fell swoop, then, assuming that there is no consistent understanding and arrangement with China, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries in advance, this one action is obviously fundamentally impossible. However, judging from the various reactions of countries since the start of the US-Japan negotiations, not only has China expressed deep concern, but the Soviet Union has remained silent; even the Dutch East Indies, which constitutes one of the most important targets for Japan's southward advance, has not expressed anything, and Britain, which shares common interests with the United States, has not seen any parallel concrete actions except for a casual mention in Churchill's speech. If the United States is holding negotiations with Japan and temporarily easing the crisis in the East in order to concentrate its efforts on dealing with Europe, then this negotiation should have been held before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, and not today, when the Soviet Union has clearly joined the anti-aggression front on both the European and Asian sides. If the United States has seen Japan's current international predicament, and is therefore taking the opportunity to take the lead and use international common pressure to first obtain its own individual interest guarantees, then this not only violates the international obligations and morals of consistent and coordinated action on the anti-aggression front, but also absolutely contradicts the United States' consistently open and upright diplomatic tradition, and, further, may disrupt the front itself and lead to its own disadvantage. These are all things that general observers cannot understand. Also, the content of these US-Japan negotiations is still an impenetrable mystery to this day. This is a very disturbing phenomenon: on the one hand, if there are no places that are unfavorable to the other countries, there is certainly no absolute need for secrecy; on the other hand, as members of the anti-aggression front, the authorities and people of China, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries all have the right and obligation to demand knowledge. Therefore, the environment and process of the United States' decision to hold negotiations with Japan must be considered a misstep. The only point that is worth reassuring to everyone is the US authorities' explanation of the "exploratory" nature of the US-Japan negotiations in the past two days. In terms of motivation, it is hoped that the United States originally had no specific opinions in the initial negotiations, and the only meaning was to explore Japan's attitude, and then jointly determine the negotiation plan with China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. In terms of content, it is also hoped that because there was originally no specific content, there is nothing to announce. Therefore, in terms of method, the negotiations between the United States and Japan are only a temporary opening nature, and any international actions in the Far East in the future must still appear in the form of collaboration on the anti-aggression front. Of course, from this perspective and limit, we should not find anything worth opposing in this contact between the United States and Japan; therefore, for the further explanation given by Washington officials the day before yesterday, we believe that this exploratory effort itself is equivalent to forming a US-Japan "quiet agreement" that temporarily does not resort to war. Only one limited requirement needs to be added. That is, whether in substance or form, it must stop there. In terms of interpretation, no further extensions can be allowed, and even for "exploratory" negotiations of the same nature, it is hoped that they will never appear again.

What needs to be discussed here is the revival of appeasementism. In terms of the United States' decision to negotiate with Japan, it certainly has no reason to hope that everyone will not have the impression that appeasementism is being revived. However, what is worth distinguishing is that the fundamental essence is very different. Regardless of the appeasementism of the British Chamberlain faction or the American isolationist faction, in essence, they are both active assertions, rather than purely passively succumbing to violence. Under their self-contained system of overall views on the world situation, they proposed the appeasement proposition to the aggressors in the East and West. Of course, the major premise is that they do not believe that the aggressors will form an irreconcilable conflict with their own countries, and therefore, they are prepared to allow the aggressors to partition the weak countries and nations, and ultimately promote conflict with the Soviet Union. However, today's situation has fundamentally changed completely. Roosevelt and Churchill have repeatedly declared to the world the severity of the crisis formed by the aggressors against the United States and Britain. And restoring the sovereignty and integrity of all invaded countries, and cooperating with the Soviet Union to the end, have formed the two major pillars of the future policies of Britain and the United States. Restoring appeasementism is equivalent to recognizing the principle of international aggression. Outstanding world politicians like Roosevelt and Churchill will never take such actions.

Finally, China's position in this US-Japan negotiation situation is the same as how the United States' specific interest estimates for China may not be the same as China's views. Of course, China's opinions on the United States' own interests may not be the same as the United States. But there are at least two points that are the same between the two countries: one is anti-aggression, and the other is cooperation in rebuilding the world. Under these two fundamental agreements, China and the United States must not only be loyal to each other, but also have the right and obligation to demand loyalty from each other.

### Washington Adopts a Firm Stance: US-Japan Negotiations Temporarily Stalled

Conciliatory Atmosphere Originates from Japanese Propaganda: Public Expects US Not to Disregard Chinese Opinions

Havas, Tokyo, 15th: Well-informed sources here recently stated that US-Japan negotiations have been shelved due to several questions raised by Washington. The content of the initial agreement, originally scheduled to be announced within days, has also been implicitly cancelled. It is said that Prime Minister Konoe originally planned to deliver a radio speech on the evening of the 10th or 11th of this month to explain the situation of the negotiations with the United States, and then President Roosevelt would respond to it in a speech on the 12th of this month. At the same time, the spokesman of the Japanese government information bureau would announce it to the press, but all of this has been cancelled. Although the nature of the deadlock in US-Japan negotiations is not known, people here believe that the future of the negotiations is not hopeless.

Reuters, Washington, 16th: News from the Far East that Tokyo and Washington are about to reach a broad compromise and that US-Japan relations are on a friendly basis has not been satisfactorily explained by well-informed sources here. The only explanation that can be obtained here is that such news comes from the Japanese side and is part of a propaganda plan to "let the wish be the father of the thought." All circles in Washington who are truly well-informed have not yet seen any signs of such a compromise. Some observers pointed out that if such a compromise is about to be reached, then why has the President not yet replied to Konoe's private letter? How can this not be strange? In the eyes of observers, Secretary of State Hull's remarks when hosting news reporters have clearly tried to deny the rumors of an impending compromise and earnestly declared that US policy is still based on the official statements issued by the US government during the Congressional Lend-Lease Act review meetings in July 1937 and January of this year. This announcement of the policy toward Japan is closely related to a third country, namely China. Japanese aggression against China is the main source of tension in US-Japan relations. If a major change occurs in US-Japan relations, it will be very closely related to China. Any resolution of this dispute that does not involve or consult with China seems impossible. Today, China and other parties have no information that the US government has consulted with China. Another matter that is also relevant is Australia. Although there has been close consultation between the State Department and Australian representatives, the Australian representatives do not seem to have expressed excessive concern about the US-Japan talks. The Chinese here have not been alarmed by the repeated rumors that a US-Japan compromise is about to be reached, and they scorn the news from Tokyo that Chongqing can negotiate with Nanjing to end the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese side may as well call the Sino-Japanese War an accidental event, but the end of this event must be discussed by both China and Japan. A certain well-informed source here said that the United States is no longer willing to accept vows of action or inaction, lest such vows may be reneged in the future due to Japan's excuse of changes in its domestic politics or the dissent of its military cliques. If Japan really expresses its willingness to take certain actions, then this step must be an irreversible step before it can be done. It is heard that in the current talks in progress, this point has been fully made clear to the Japanese government, and there is no room for any misunderstanding. What can be said at present is that exploratory discussions are currently underway. All those who are truly well-informed in Washington do not believe that the talks in the current stage can lead to a "truce" with Japan. In other words, they believe that US-Japan relations will remain stalled, not improving or worsening compared to before. It may not be without benefit for Japan to continue to wait and see for opportunities, and for the United States to have no need to deal with the war in the Pacific at this time. As for whether the economic sanctions imposed by the United States on Japan during these exploratory talks can be slightly relaxed, there is no such intention here. We must know that the most feared thing for Japan is the deterioration of relations with the United States, so people here cannot see the need to sacrifice the United States or China's concessions to Japan. The Japanese spokesperson's statement reported by Tokyo that Japan allows US oil tankers to sail to Vladivostok is probably of its true value as a statement of Japanese friendship toward the United States. As everyone knows, Japan is quite alarmed that the Soviet Union can get US supplies while Japan cannot. In the eyes of those familiar with the Far East situation, today's remarks by the Japanese spokesperson are an effort to cover up their weakness.

Wakasugi Returns Hastily to Assume Office: Special Envoys Accompanying Him

Reuters, Tokyo, 16th: Wakasugi, the Japanese ambassador to the United States without a fixed term, returned home two weeks ago to report on his duties. After consulting with senior naval personnel and government officials in his country for many times, and holding at least one important meeting with US Ambassador Grew, he has now returned to the United States. Ishii, an information bureau spokesperson, announced this matter this morning when hosting news reporters. He said that the officer set sail yesterday, accompanied by a special commissioner from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but he did not allow the disclosure of the person's name, position, or mission in Washington. Ishii also answered questions, saying that the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union have not responded to the questions raised regarding Japan's supply of goods to Vladivostok. He also said that he could not say when the Japanese government will send someone to fill the vacancy of the ambassador to Britain. Finally, he answered questions, saying that the small-scale trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies are still ongoing in Batavia.

Eastern Newspaper Warns: Do Not Fall Into the American Trap

Reuters, Tokyo, 16th: Tokutomi, a famous commentator, published an article in "Daily News" stating that Britain and the United States are now making suggestions to Japan because they cannot bear to fight in the ocean. The true policy behind the effort for "appeasement" is to prevent Japan from advancing. Britain is now following the United States in various policies toward Japan, because Churchill wants to drag the United States into the war, and President Roosevelt is trying to promote his country's participation in the war in order to achieve his goal of "inheriting" the British Empire. If Japan can see this point, everything will be very good. However, if it cannot, then it does not know what kind of trap it will encounter.

### Duff Cooper Praises China's Resistance: The Far East Anti-Aggression Line is Strong; Japan is Isolated and Helpless

Reuters, Singapore, 16th: Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's representative for the Far East, praised China's resistance yesterday. Cooper, commenting on the Soviet Union's twelve weeks of fighting against Germany, said that the Chinese people, one of the most peace-loving nations in the world, also evoked the world's admiration for their success in resisting the modern-equipped army that invaded China for four years without giving up.

Reuters, Singapore, 16th: Duff Cooper, the British Cabinet's representative for the Far East, broadcast to London yesterday, describing his first impressions of the Far East. He said that the Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean in the world, and the collection of all the land in the world cannot compare to its vastness. It seems that the Pacific world should play a greater role in human events than the Atlantic Ocean. Today, only one country in the Pacific is attached to the Axis powers, and the rest support the Allied cause. Their power is extremely great. China has 400 million people who have been stimulated by the invasion, and their patriotism has erupted, and they have gained a new understanding of unity and maintained their independence, thus resolving to get rid of their enemies. The Dutch East Indies is a beautiful and rich place, and the Dutch have shown in the sea, land, and air that they have not forgotten their former military glory. The Soviet Union spans Europe and Asia and is almost an invincible fighter. The United States has 130 million people who are committed to destroying autocracy and supporting Britain, and the British Empire has the support of Australia and New Zealand, and is willing to assist the Allies with all its strength. The power of these countries is terrifying. A year ago, the Soviet Union was still connected to the Axis powers, and the United States was not yet prepared to maintain freedom and justice, but today the situation has completely changed. Once so many great countries act together to deal with any event, there is no doubt about the outcome. The above remarks are actually a warning to Japan, because Japan is isolated and a single country cannot compete with the great powers.

### Hurricane Hits Hong Kong: Two Ships Aground, Ferry Service Suspended, All Commerce Halted

Hong Kong: Hong Kong was struck today by a hurricane of 100 miles per hour, lasting eight hours. Two ships were grounded, and two others drifted in the harbor. The hurricane passed east of Hong Kong towards Macau at 1:00 PM, but Hong Kong still experienced wind and rain this afternoon. The hurricane is expected to cease completely tonight. Four ships encountered difficulties in the harbor, including two that were grounded and two that were knocked loose from their moorings and drifted outside the harbor. One of the grounded ships refloated two hours after grounding. Daytime ferry services were suspended. Furious waves surged and crashed onto the piers. Commerce in both Hong Kong and Kowloon has come to a standstill. (Sixteenth Associated Press dispatch)

### Chinese Envoy to Australia Presents Credentials

Reuters, Canberra, 16th: When Xu Mo, the first Chinese envoy to Australia, presented his credentials to the Australian Governor-General Lord Gowrie, he stated that the heroic achievements of the Australian forces on various front lines have deeply impressed the Chinese people, who are now defending their homeland with equal courage and determination. The Governor-General replied that Mr. Xu's appointment will not only maintain the friendly relations between China and Australia but will also expand them. The *Min Sheng Daily* commented that the lofty courage and determination displayed by the Chinese people in resisting Japan's attempts at conquest are historically unprecedented. The arrival of China's first envoy, Xu Mo, is a powerful indication of China's determination to continue fighting until complete freedom is restored.

### Tenth Anniversary of the Northeast Incident: Expanded Commemoration Held: China's War Aims Against Japan: To Safeguard National Territorial Integrity

Chongqing: At its regular meeting yesterday morning, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang passed a temporary motion to hold an expanded commemoration on "September 18th" to mark the tenth anniversary of the Mukden Incident. The situation on that day is bound to be spectacular. The anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War was previously decided by the Central Executive Committee to be held jointly on "July 7th." The current resolution is a strong indication that China has not forgotten the three northeastern provinces. Observers speculate that this is related to the US-Japan talks. The United States does not engage in secret diplomacy, but this time, it has been unusually tight-lipped. Japan's war against China has been costly, and it is determined not to withdraw empty-handed before being defeated. The fact that it is enthusiastic about these talks suggests that China's move at this time is not without purpose. Chiang Kai-shek's speech on the 10th is of great significance in history. His urgent reiteration of China's war aim of driving the Japanese out of the country is perhaps necessary. (Sixteenth Havas dispatch)

Liu Shangqing's Remarks

Chongqing: The *Xinhua Daily* published remarks by Liu Shangqing, stating, "It has been a full ten years since 'September 18th.' It is not enough for everyone to write articles and give speeches as usual for the commemoration. We must 'do' something. Recovering the Northeast is not only the fervent hope of our compatriots in the Northeast and the call of the nation, but also the goal of our struggle. The prerequisite for doing so is the unity of the nation. Some people are pessimistic about the US-Japan talks, but I don't think so. As long as we do a better job with our national policy of self-reliance, we will make better friends." Liu is an important figure from the Northeast, who served as Minister of Interior of the National Government, and is now a 72-year-old member of the National Government. (Sixteenth Havas dispatch)

Chongqing: At the request of the International Broadcasting Station, members of the Chinese Goodwill Mission to Burma in Chongqing are scheduled to broadcast to Burma in English for two minutes each on the "September 18th" commemoration day, from 6:45 PM to 7:00 PM. (Sixteenth dispatch)

### Wang Xiaolai Issues Statement

Hong Kong: Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement, recently issued a statement, stating that after the Association's office at 303 Shanghai Hong Kong Road was occupied, important documents were moved to Hong Kong, and the office was relocated. In accordance with the repeated telegram orders of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the re-election was suspended during the extraordinary period, and the association's affairs were maintained by the original staff. It has now been reported that announcements have been made in the name of the Association, scheduling an investigation of the qualifications of taxpayers within the settlement.

### Sichuan Starts Collecting Actual Goods: Collection Begins

### Red Army in the Kiev Region Adopts Elastic Defense Tactics: Inflicts Significant Casualties on Offensive German Forces: Fierce Fighting Continues on the Outskirts of Leningrad

Reuters, London, 16th: Here, the German threat to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, is given much attention. The German High Command apparently intends to re-apply the pincer offensive in the area. So far, there are no extremely important towns that must be defended at all costs in the areas where fighting has occurred on the outer defensive lines of the Kiev region. Therefore, Soviet forces may as well fight and retreat while inflicting maximum casualties on the enemy. This "elastic defense" method has proven to be quite successful. Only the Soviet forces in Tallinn (the capital of Estonia) and Odessa have not avoided encirclement by German forces. However, both places can have reinforcements and military supplies transported from the sea to Tallinn. The Soviet forces will only retreat when they can no longer resist. Odessa, on the other hand, is still being held, and it seems likely that it will be able to be held for a long time. The situation in Leningrad is not quite the same, as the Soviets claim that although the city is under serious threat, it has not been completely surrounded. Kiev is also currently under threat. The Soviet forces apparently have no intention of withdrawing from the area but will rely on indomitable spirit, strong defenses, and the harshness of winter to deter the German forces. Currently, the German forces are apparently concentrating all their efforts on the attack in order to achieve a victory that will determine the outcome of the war before the imminent winter. The Mermansk area in the Arctic Ocean has already had its first snowfall, and the temperature in the south is very low, indicating that the severe winter will arrive early. A harsh winter is most favorable to the defending forces, as the Soviet forces are not only resistant to the cold but also have better shelters and cold-weather equipment.

Associated Press, Berlin, 16th: An authoritative military spokesman said yesterday that the great battle of Leningrad is taking place on the outskirts, less than fifteen miles from the center of the city. Soviet troops are currently resisting desperately to defend every inch of land. Due to incessant heavy rain, the transportation of German military supplies and heavy equipment has become very difficult. Currently, Leningrad is defended by a chain of sentry boxes, which have six-foot-thick walls and steel embrasures. Their defensive lines are also equipped with tank traps six feet deep and nine feet wide, covered with branches and weeds. Since the German forces first threatened Leningrad after occupying the Baltic states, the residents of Leningrad, both men and women, young and old, have been engaged in digging defensive fortifications. German military sources also said that the Soviets have also established a number of field defense projects, built with tree trunks, branches, and the like, with land mines underneath and barbed wire in front. The military spokesman also said that General Leeb's troops had broken through multiple lines and penetrated deep into the Soviet defenses in the past few weeks.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th: The German High Command issued a special announcement today stating that to the south of Lake Ilmen, the elite troops of the Soviet 11th, 27th, and 34th Armies were recently defeated by German forces and German aircraft commanded by Lieutenant General Busch and Lieutenant General Keller. Nine divisions of the enemy were completely annihilated, and several other divisions suffered heavy losses. A total of over 53,000 enemy troops were captured. The enemy lost 320 tanks and 695 cannons.

### German Landing at the Entrance to the Gulf of Riga Fails

Reuters, London, 16th: A recent Soviet communiqué stated that the German forces attempted to land on the island of Osel at the entrance to the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea yesterday, but failed at a great cost. Soviet forces repulsed the German landing attempt, sinking four German transport ships and one destroyer, and heavily damaging two transport ships and several destroyers. In addition, fierce fighting continued across the entire front yesterday. Soviet aircraft bombed the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanza.

### Nazi Losses in Two Months of Operation: 8,000 Tanks

Reuters, Moscow, 16th: Moscow Radio broadcast yesterday about the enormous losses of German tanks on the Eastern Front. It was said that Goebbels used to rely on the misconception that German tanks were invincible. While this may have been true when German forces were fighting isolated and weak countries in Western Europe, it has been completely disproven in the war against the Soviet Union. During the first week of the German operation against the Soviet Union, their losses in tanks could still be replenished. However, after three weeks of operation, Hitler had already lost twelve tank divisions, and after two months, he had lost 8,000 tanks. These figures are only the beginning of the huge losses that the German forces will suffer.

### 500,000 Elite German Troops Transferred from the Western Front to the Eastern Front

Reuters, London, 16th: Due to heavy losses on the Eastern Front, the German forces have been forced to transfer nearly 500,000 of their elite troops from France, Holland, and Belgium. According to estimates by well-informed sources here, before the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the number of troops stationed in France, Holland, and Belgium was between forty and fifty divisions. Unexpectedly, as a result of the valiant resistance of the Soviet forces, the losses were unexpectedly heavy, and the elite troops transferred to and from have reached 400,000 to 500,000. The German High Command may even transfer older and younger soldiers to supplement the troops stationed in France, Holland, and Belgium, in order to transfer soldiers aged 25 to 35 for combat on the Eastern Front.

### Soviet Women Do Not Yield to Men: Great Achievements Are Laudable and Tragic

Associated Press, Moscow, 16th: Yesterday's news here was that the partisan forces in Belarus are becoming increasingly active. In August, thousands of German troops were annihilated. In the Pinsky Province, partisan forces destroyed 20 warehouses, patrolled 16 tanks, 115 supply trucks, and 100 cargo cars carrying ammunition.

Reuters, London, 16th: London heard yesterday on Moscow Radio that Soviet women are participating in partisan warfare, and it was said that a fifteen-year-old girl in a village was beaten to death by German soldiers. As a result, 18 women rose up to take revenge. They climbed onto the roof of the building where the German troops had set up their headquarters, knocked down the sentry, poured kerosene all over the house, and set it on fire. Three German officers who escaped from the house were all killed. One was reportedly axed to death by a 16-year-old milkmaid.

### US Amends Neutrality Act: Allows Ships to Sail to War Zones: The Middle East, Near East, and British Territories: Official Interpretation Includes All

Associated Press, Washington, 16th: The State Department announced yesterday that US ships will henceforth carry war supplies and passengers to most of the United Kingdom, an act previously prohibited by the Neutrality Act. At the same time, it was learned that President Roosevelt had discussed with congressional leaders the possibility of amending the Neutrality Act. House Speaker Rayburn declared that the issue would be discussed, but did not clarify whether President Roosevelt emphasized allowing ships to enter combat zones or arming ships. The State Department stated that allowing US ships to transport supplies and passengers to "the British Empire" only applies to England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. It also stated that President Roosevelt previously referred to "the British Empire" when announcing that Germany had declared a state of war with "France, the British Empire, India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa." On the other hand, according to the Neutrality Act, US ships are not allowed to travel to the aforementioned areas. State Department officials refused to specify which specific areas US ships could travel to under the new interpretation, but they believe that it will include Aden, Egypt, the Malayan Straits Settlements, British Somaliland, and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

### British and American Consultations: Aid to the Soviet Union: Delegations from Both Countries Will Go to the Soviet Capital Together

Reuters, London, 16th: Averell Harriman, head of the US mission to Moscow, arrived in the UK yesterday with three members of the mission. Harriman said, "We are eager to travel to Moscow as soon as possible within the realm of possibility." Today, the US mission will consult with Lord Beaverbrook, leader of the British mission. Upon Harriman's arrival in the UK, he was greeted by British Foreign Secretary Eden, Minister of Supply Beaverbrook, Undersecretary of Aviation Balfour, US Ambassador Winant, Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky, Soviet Ambassador to the US Oumansky, and other dignitaries. The members of the US mission who came with him were US Navy Admiral Standley, Army Major General Burns, and Batt from the Production Management Office.

Reuters, London, 16th: All tanks and tank parts manufactured in the UK next week will be shipped directly to the Soviet Union to defend the front lines of Leningrad, Kiev, and Odessa. This new expression of the UK's full support for the Soviet Union was announced by Minister of Supply Beaverbrook in a telegram to workers at all tank factories. He said, "I urge you to do your utmost to work diligently and without delay. From now on, British tank factories must not only supply tanks to the British army but also supply the Soviet army, which is now fighting for the same glorious cause. Therefore, starting next Monday, September 22, the tanks you manufacture within seven days will be shipped to the front lines defending Leningrad, Kiev, and Odessa to participate in the battle."

### Japan Assembles Heavy Troops on the Korean Border: Seriously Threatens Vladivostok: Koreans Contribute Ideas to America

Associated Press, Washington, 16th: The representative of the "Korean-Chinese United Association" stationed here wrote to Secretary of State Hull yesterday, drawing attention to Japan's base at Najin (transliteration) in Korea, which is only 150 miles away from Vladivostok, a key Soviet port for shipping supplies. Mr. Han stated that Japan has stationed 50,000 troops, 350 aircraft, and 12 submarines in Najin. He claimed that Najin is now one of the three most important bases of the Japanese Empire. Vladivostok is the only ice-free port in the Soviet Union in the North Pacific. Unless the United States and the Soviet Union take the initiative, the port will inevitably be threatened by the Japanese war machine. Mr. Han said, "We would like to present our humble opinion and request consultation with the Soviet Union for the US military to take over Vladivostok and the Kamchatka Peninsula, just as Iceland."

### The King of Iran Declares Abdication, Crown Prince Inherits the Throne

Sixteenth Reuters, London. The King of Iran has announced his abdication, and the throne will be succeeded by the eldest son, the Crown Prince.

### Ministry of Education Approves and Announces Measures to Subsidize Medical Teachers, Implementing with Funding Obtained from the Rockefeller Foundation

(Chongqing Airmail) The Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education has formulated temporary measures to subsidize the salaries of medical teachers, which have been approved for implementation. The original text of the measures is as follows:

(3) Professors, associate professors, lecturers, or medical experts who request subsidies from the Ministry shall fill out a special form and submit it to the Ministry on time for review by the Medical Education Committee.

### Ge Zhaotong Successfully Researches Electric Indexing Machine, Making Great Contributions to Culture and Scholarship

Ge Zhaotong, the inventor of the practical indexing machine, has recently greatly improved the hand-cranked indexing machine he previously invented based on his painstaking research. Now, this machine can not only index Chinese books from ancient times to the present, but also be used to index books from any country in the world. When the indexing machine was first invented, there was only the hand-cranked type. After continuous research, several different forms have been obtained. The most important of these is the successful research and development of the electric indexing machine. The electric indexing machine only requires the indexer to insert a special, ingenious key into the machine according to the text of the information they want to find, and turn on the power switch. Then, the information you want to find in any book, whether Chinese or foreign, can be found within a few minutes. For example, if you want to find out which book the sentence "A sage will arise every hundred years" comes from, you can use a special key to insert it into the machine and shake the indexing machine by hand or electricity. After shaking, you can get a slip of paper from the back of the machine or a piece of paper from the drawer at the bottom of the machine. Both the slip of paper and the piece of paper are printed with "Meng Gong 122, 3, 11-18", meaning Mencius, Gongsun Chou chapter, page 122, line 3, the eleventh to eighteenth characters. The electric indexing machine is most suitable for indexing a large number of books from ancient times to the present, both Chinese and foreign, because it rotates quickly and saves time. The hand-cranked practical indexing machine has also been improved into a sophisticated machine. When the hand-cranked indexing machine was first invented, one hand had to crank the machine and the other hand had to type the numbers. Now, the number typing part has been changed to automatic, meaning that only one hand needs to crank the machine, and the numbers can be automatically typed on the paper strip without the need for human hands. This saves both eyesight and hand strength. Culture and scholarship are developed and progressing in various European and American countries, but there is still no complete index book. Although there is a Bible index, it can only search for sentences, like Ye Shaojun's Thirteen Classics Index. Furthermore, there are many books in China that need to be indexed, such as the Thirteen Classics, the philosophers, the Twenty-Four Histories, Compendium of Materia Medica, the Three Principles of the People, etc. There is a Chinese proverb that says, "Where to start with the Twenty-Four Histories?" Now that the indexing machine has been invented, any word, sentence, or chapter title in the Twenty-Four Histories can be indexed. Newspapers and magazines can also be incorporated into the indexing machine. Chapter titles with special and obvious marks can be found, which is also a special feature of the indexing machine and makes a great contribution to world culture and scholarship. According to Mr. Ge, he would not be willing to give up his invention rights even for a price of ten thousand U.S. dollars.

### Points Handicap Basketball Finals: Shanghai Star Wins First Game Against Tongren; Second Game Scheduled for This Friday

The second Points Handicap Basketball Tournament began its finals yesterday. Shanghai Star faced Tongren at 6 PM at the Paramount Ballroom. Because Shanghai Star is one of the top four teams in Shanghai and has a strong lineup, they gave up as much as twenty points even in the finals stage. Tongren is a rising star, with the four outstanding Yi brothers and the fierce general Jiang Shuliang, making their lineup also quite solid. The game was extremely tense. Liang Yunming and Chen Bangzhen of Shanghai Star and Xuan Jun of Tongren were evenly matched. In the first half, Shanghai Star scored thirty points and Tongren scored twenty-two points, but due to the handicap, Shanghai Star was still at a disadvantage with thirty points against forty-two. After switching sides, the players of Shanghai Star launched coordinated attacks, and Tongren struggled to defend. They relied on Jiang Shuliang and Xuan Tong to work hard to regain some ground. In the end, Shanghai Star won the first victory with seventy-eight points against sixty-five. The second game is scheduled to be held at the same venue this Friday. Yesterday afternoon, there was also an exhibition match between South China and Huaqiang starting at 5 PM.

### Yiyou Table Tennis Semifinals

Kong Hanchen Defeats the Ever-Victorious Army

Cheng Shuming Suspends Game Due to Sister's Death

The Yiyou Cup Individual Table Tennis Championship had three semifinals last night, starting at 8 PM at the club's ball room on Fuxu Lane, Tianjin Road. Shan Zhengchen served as the referee. In the first match, young Yang Changjia, from the ever-victorious army, defeated his elder brother Yang Changxi with a score of 3-2. Li Feixiang defeated Li Ranchun in the final match with a score of 3-2. Yang Changjia then faced Kong Hanchen again. Kong is a veteran in the silk and cloth industry and has a very stable stroke. Although the young Yang launched a desperate attack, he lost due to his small size and lack of strength. In the end, a dark horse emerged, and the ever-victorious army suffered a terrible defeat. Old Kong defeated the young player with a score of 3-2, which can be said to be no easy feat. The original schedule for tonight was Yang Changjia against Cheng Shuming, but Cheng's sister passed away due to illness yesterday morning, so tonight's match could not be held. The standing committee decided to suspend the match for a few days and then reschedule it. After the Cheng-Yang match is held, the championship will be scheduled. At that time, Mr. Chen Jimao, the former table tennis team leader of the club, will be invited to serve as the chief referee. The results of yesterday's matches are recorded as follows:

### U.S. Earnestly Implements Lend-Lease Act, Sino-American Cooperation Strengthens, New York Organizes Emergency Council for Democracy, Convenes Conference to Promote Defense Strategies, Shanghai Observers Believe U.S.-Japan Negotiations Not Worthy of Attention

Since the U.S. and Japan engaged in exploratory negotiations, various parties have speculated about the consequences. A reporter from Xin Sheng asked well-informed observers in Shanghai. According to them, any speculation arising from the U.S.-Japan negotiations has no credible or noteworthy basis. China has been fighting for more than four years, becoming the Far Eastern fortress of the world's democratic camp, preventing other countries from being affected. Without China's strong perseverance for nearly four years, what would have happened to British and American interests in Southeast Asia after the outbreak of the European war, and what would have happened to Russia's eastern border? The United States is well aware of this fact and would never be willing to harm its own traditional rights and interests. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the U.S.-Japan negotiations, the United States will never sacrifice China, as evidenced by Foreign Minister Guo's remarks on the 15th.

China's Basic National Policy Remains Unchanged

The United States certainly does not intend to sacrifice China, and China will certainly not sacrifice the honorable position it has gained through four years of bloody battles, as well as its right to national construction. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has made a solemn statement on this matter: "I emphasize to our American friends that China will not change its policy of fighting to the end and will make the necessary sacrifices until the Far East and the world obtain permanent and fair peace." China's position in the Pacific is extremely important, and the United States has no reason to abandon this mainstay of the Far East. China's basic national policy has also not changed in any way.

U.S. Lend-Lease Act Earnestly Implemented

In fact, the U.S. policy of aiding China has not shown any signs of decline due to the ongoing U.S.-Japan negotiations. In his report to Congress on the Lend-Lease Act on the 15th, President Roosevelt stated that the main task of the Lend-Lease program is to aid China and the United Kingdom. The purpose of the program is also to improve, expand, and secure the sea routes for transporting essential goods to China, maintain domestic transportation in China, and enhance China's air force. President Roosevelt's presentation of a report on the aid to China program during the negotiations with Japan is tantamount to a serious warning. Sino-American cooperation is becoming stronger, and the strength of cooperation can make any actions aimed at achieving the opposite results a bubble. In short, China is still in a harmonious international environment, and its diplomacy and military will take the initiative, expecting to bear bright fruits and achieve its long-standing expectations.

Three Countries United in Defending Democracy

The Emergency Council for Democracy in the United States was founded by the famous American radio commentator, Mr. Grant Stern. Through Mr. Stern's efforts, it has gained the attention of all sectors of American politics, business, and academia. The purpose of the Council is purely to meet the needs of the times, to explain the fundamental and important issues of survival for democratic countries in the current era to the citizens of various democratic countries, and to enable the citizens of various democratic countries to recognize, participate in, and promote the urgent work of defending democratic politics. According to the Council's news, the Emergency Council for Democracy in New York is scheduled to hold a meeting at the Madison Square Garden at 7:30 PM on the 19th of this month. It is expected that more than tens of thousands of people will attend the meeting. The meeting will be chaired by Mr. Robert H. Jackson, a current judge of the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Charles Evans Hughes, the former Governor of New York, and dozens of other celebrities will deliver passionate speeches to encourage the public to defend democracy. In addition to American citizens, many British expatriates will participate. However, the Council believes that among the citizens of all countries who represent the spirit of democracy, China is the mainstay in addition to the nationals of the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, this emergency meeting cannot be without Chinese participation. Therefore, the Council has contacted the Central Committee of the China Aid Association to ask them to consult with responsible groups in Chinatown to invite overseas Chinese to participate on their behalf, so as to win glory for the Chinese nation. The committee has now contacted the New York General Association and asked them to instruct the overseas Chinese in Chinatown to participate.

According to a Japanese news agency report from Hong Kong on the 15th, after the meeting of the Stabilization Fund Committee in Hong Kong, the Chinese members of the committee, Chen Guangfu and Bei Songsun, flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing on the 14th. The American member, Fuchs, originally planned to go to Chongqing but has changed his plans and arrived in Shanghai on the 12th aboard a ship with an assistant named Taylor. The British member, Hall Patch, and the Chinese member, Xi Demao, remained in Hong Kong to preside over everything. It is confirmed that a ship did arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong that day, the Zhesaria of the Java Company, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. However, there is no reliable information to confirm whether the two men arrived in Shanghai on that ship. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inquired with Mr. Hawkins, the general manager of the Mercantile Bank, who stated, "This is not accurate. To the best of my knowledge, Fuchs was still in Hong Kong last week." Since the 12th was last Friday, and it is confirmed tonight that Fuchs did not leave Hong Kong last week, then the report of his arrival in Shanghai must be a false rumor.

### Italian Warships Sail to Southern Huangpu

There are currently three Italian warships berthed in the Huangpu River. The No. 12 buoy outside the Waibaidu Bridge is the designated Italian naval buoy, where the Repanto-class shallow-water gunboat and the E. Carlotto-class light cruiser, which arrived in Shanghai from Kobe at the end of last month, are berthed. In addition, the Eritrea-class shallow-water gunboat is berthed at buoy No. 20/21. It is learned that the two light cruisers suddenly set sail from buoy No. 12 to Southern Huangpu the day before yesterday. It is unknown whether they are undergoing repairs. As for the shallow-water gunboat berthed at buoy No. 20/21, it was also moved to buoy No. 12 to berth alongside another shallow-water gunboat.

### Public Warehouse Foreign Exchange Fund Specially Approved for Unfreezing, Equivalent to 17 Million National Currency, Transferred to Central Bank for Original Currency Withdrawal

After the United States froze Chinese funds, the government decided to reward the inward transfer of funds. All foreign exchange assets of domestic Chinese and foreign people could be unfrozen by the Central Bank. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that the British foreign exchange fund used by the Public Warehouse Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council to purchase cheap rice, equivalent to 17 million National Currency, was originally deposited in Chinese commercial banks such as the Continental Bank. Due to the impact of the freezing order on the Chinese commercial banks, it has been specially approved to transfer the fund to the Central Bank for safekeeping and unfreezing. In the future, the Public Warehouse Committee will be able to deposit and withdraw the original currency from the Central Bank to facilitate the purchase of foreign rice. According to the Ministry of Finance's regulations on unfreezing foreign exchange assets, the Central Bank may purchase or deposit foreign currency drafts or bank deposit certificates at the price of 5 and 5/16 (i.e., 18 yuan and 81 cents legal tender per U.S. dollar) or 5 and 5/32 (i.e., 76 yuan and 08 cents legal tender per pound sterling) legal tender per foreign currency. After being exchanged for legal tender, withdrawals can be made. If the original currency still needs to be withdrawn, the approval of the Stabilization Fund Committee is required.

### After the Assassination of Two Russian Émigrés, All White Russians in Shanghai Are Shocked; Suleikinikov Replaces the Chairman of the White Russian Association; Assassin of Mamantov Arrested by French Police; the Two Assassination Cases Are Related

The English-language "The China Press" reported that after the Chairman of the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Committee, Ivanov, was shot and killed on Moore Road yesterday (the 15th), a member of the committee, Suleikinikov, has been appointed to act as chairman. Mr. Suleikinikov is 55 years old and has been a member of the committee for 13 years. It is very likely that he will soon be elected as the new chairman.

Russian Expatriates Shocked, Undertake Prevention

At the same time, the authorities continued to investigate the assassination of Ivanov this morning (the 16th), but have not yet apprehended the perpetrator. It is generally believed that the case was politically motivated, but the police have remained silent on the matter. Reliable sources said that Ivanov's assassination is related to the assassination of Russian Mamantov on Sunday night.

It is said that after the occurrence of these two cases, the lives of several other Russians in this area are also in danger, and they are now taking preventive measures. The White Russians in Shanghai were shocked by the assassination of Ivanov. Last night, they flocked to the Henry Road Church to offer their condolences. The Russian side said that Ivanov was assassinated in similar circumstances to the former chairman of the White Russian Emigrant Committee, Metzlera. Ivanov's body may be buried in the Jing'an Temple Cemetery, but the date of burial has not been determined.

Mamantov Assassination Case Solved

Mamantov (Serge Mamantolf, previously reported as Malotov), a Russian who worked for the Russian-language Dadao Times published by the Japanese in Hongkou, was shot on Huanlong Road while riding in a rickshaw on the evening of the 14th of this month. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but eventually died at 4 PM on the 15th due to critical injuries. The French Concession Police Department conducted an investigation and quickly solved the case. The perpetrator is the bodyguard of a Chinese resident of Montauban Road.

Named Liu Fanglin

(transliteration), 38 years old. The French police immediately cooperated with the Public Concession police authorities to arrest the suspect Liu at the Chinese resident's home on Montauban Road. It is reported that Liu has confessed that he is the perpetrator who shot and assassinated Mamantov, and has also confessed to several other Chinese involved in the case. It is expected that these Chinese will also be arrested soon. However, details about these accomplices could not be ascertained. It is also reported that before his death, Mamantov named several people to the French police, claiming that they instigated the crime. Therefore, several suspects were arrested yesterday morning, including several Russians, all of whom were subsequently released except for a Russian actor and writer named Hevans, who remains in custody. Mamantov told the police that Hevans had threatened to kill him. The French Police Department questioned Hevans yesterday, but declined to disclose details.

### Tenth Anniversary of the September 18th Incident: Strict Alert by Military and Police

Intensified Patrols and Defenses Initiated Yesterday

For the sake of maintaining order within their jurisdictions and ensuring the safety of residents, the police authorities of the two concessions began implementing security measures yesterday morning, on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident). In addition to prohibiting all illegal gatherings and activities, all detectives were divided into districts and shifts, dispatched to various roads to undertake duties such as guarding, patrolling, and inspection. Male and female inspection teams, patrol car teams, and red emergency vehicle reserve teams also took turns patrolling various districts of the concessions. The defense forces of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps assisted the police in areas where they were insufficient, and defensive arrangements along the borders were also strengthened early on. In the western district of the Public Concession, such as Yuyuan Road and Jing'an Temple Road, additional armed police officers were dispatched to guard posts near sandbag bunkers, selectively inspecting pedestrians and vehicles passing by. In the French Concession area, including Route Heger and Route Tenant de la Tour, in addition to the existing obstacles and armed detectives, patrol car teams took turns patrolling, and patrol teams composed of Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched daily to patrol the border roads or guard key transportation routes to prevent incidents. Furthermore, at 2 PM yesterday afternoon, during a busy time for pedestrian and vehicle traffic at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, someone dropped a large number of slogans from the rooftop, stirring excitement among the viewing public.

### President Monroe Sails South Yesterday Morning, Carrying Passengers, New French Mail Ship Arrives Tomorrow Morning, Carrying 14,000 Bags of Tribute Rice

The President Monroe, a World Class mail ship of the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai from the United States the night before last and docked at Floating Pontoon Numbers Fourteen and Fifteen, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The mail ship left port yesterday morning, passing through various ports in Southeast Asia and returning to the United States according to its World Class route. It carried 24 passengers from the United States, and approximately 30 passengers who either transferred to go to Southeast Asia or were tourists. Only a little more than 20 people from Shanghai boarded the mail ship to go to Southeast Asia. Furthermore, it is stipulated that the President Adams will return to Shanghai from Manila and Hong Kong around the 27th of this month, returning to Los Angeles via Honolulu. The Linois, a French mail ship of the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes, will arrive directly in Shanghai from Saigon tomorrow morning, carrying 14,000 bags of tribute rice. This ship is a recent arrival to Shanghai. The Sindh, another ship of the company, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Yokohama, Japan, today.

### Bank Interest Rate Reductions, Collection of Bill Discount Fees, Elimination of Preferential Treatment

Commercial banks, in light of the easing of credit in the Shanghai market, have decided to reduce interest rates on fixed and current deposits. At the same time, a handling fee of one dime (10 cents) in national currency will be charged for each check used by current account holders, or one dime for each bill discount. However, those who discount bills will no longer be charged a check fee. As for the branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank in the rear areas, as well as the branches of various commercial banks, all will raise interest rates on various deposits, aiming to encourage the natural inward flow of excess capital in Shanghai.

Current Account Interest at Two Li

A notice from the Continental Bank and other banks states: "It has been decided that, starting from this period, the interest rate on current deposits, originally set at two li per week or higher, will be temporarily changed to two li per week. Interest will be calculated based on the lowest balance at the end of each month, with fractions less than one hundred yuan not counted. This is hereby notified for your attention."

Cancellation of Increased Interest Rate Method

Regulations for bill discounts and bill interest for the native banks have been established: (1) The maximum fee for local or foreign bill discounts is two jiao per thousand yuan; (3) The minimum bill interest is one jiao per thousand yuan. However, the regulations for banks do not include provisions for bill discounts and bill interest. Therefore, exchange shops have always collected bill discounts. Now, banks such as the Chekiang Industrial Bank are also collecting bill discount fees. Regarding deposit interest rates, each bank has revised its rates based on market conditions and the urgency of demand, in accordance with industry regulations. However, the banks and native banks are not completely uniform. Past preferential measures, such as adding a certain amount to the interest rate for daily or monthly balances exceeding a certain amount, have been completely canceled.

### China Central Telecommunications Company Bomb Explosion

The former Shanghai International Radio Station, now known as the China Central Telecommunications Company, located in the Sassoon House on the Bund in Nanjing Road, is accessed through the Renji Road entrance. The transmitting and receiving equipment are installed in rooms 130 to 131 of the building. At around 11 PM last night, a large timed bomb suddenly exploded in those rooms, with thick smoke and flames spreading everywhere, and the sound shaking nearby areas. The explosive force was extremely strong, shattering the large glass windows of the Sassoon House, with fragments falling onto Renji Road. Upon hearing the alarm, the police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate, and the fire department also sent ambulances to the scene. After the black smoke dissipated, it was found that there was no fire, and only one worker was slightly injured. The detectives took the shrapnel to the police station for investigation. It is said that the adjacent Democratic Radio Station also suffered losses.

### Special Martial Law Suddenly Imposed at the North Railway Station Yesterday

Starting at around 7 AM yesterday, special martial law was suddenly imposed at the North Railway Station in Zhabei. Passengers inside the station were completely evacuated into the concession, and even street vendors selling bread and other small items were driven away. Xinmin Road, from the Han Bridge eastward through Baoshan Road, Fusheng Road, to the intersection of North Jiangxi Road, and Bazilu Road, was closed to all pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Traffic was also cut off at both sides of Baoshan Road facing north toward Qujiang Road. Soldiers of the Japanese and Chinese armies stood guard everywhere, creating a very tense situation. This lasted for about two hours, and the martial law was lifted after 9 AM.

### Hong Kong Government Announces New Entry Regulations for Wartime Needs: Strict Restrictions on Entering and Transiting Passengers, Certificate Application Procedures Divided into Five Categories

To meet wartime needs, the Hong Kong government has announced new entry regulations to reduce population density, abolish the system of landing with guarantor guarantees, and strengthen inspections of ships entering Hong Kong. However, Chinese compatriots can enter Hong Kong with passports issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The China Travel Service has established close contact with the Immigration Department and continues to issue temporary entry permits. Passengers holding these permits will not be obstructed and can exchange them for official documents upon arrival in Hong Kong. The new entry regulations are outlined below:

(1) Passengers coming to Hong Kong for employment purposes must have their companies' deputy managers or responsible persons personally bring the company seal to the Immigration Department to sign an employment guarantee (Bond Employment), proving that the applicant is a member of their staff, hired from a certain location for a certain position with a certain monthly salary. The company will be absolutely responsible for sending the employee out of the country within ten days, regardless of whether the employee resigns or is dismissed. Otherwise, the department may prosecute based on the guarantee.

(2) Passengers coming to Hong Kong for visiting relatives and friends must have their relatives and friends provide a guarantee and sign a tourist guarantee (Bond Visiting). The department will grant a reasonable period, before the expiration of which the visitor must leave Hong Kong. Otherwise, the guarantor will bear all responsibility or be fined.

(3) Passengers coming to Hong Kong to transfer to another location must also have a Hong Kong shop provide a guarantee, stating the date of departure from Hong Kong. At that time, the guarantor must bring the passenger's ticket to the department to cancel it, in order to fulfill their responsibility.

(4) The Immigration Department treats temporary entry permits issued by travel agencies very favorably. The restrictions are not as strict as those mentioned above. Transit passengers are exempt from providing a shop guarantee and are given a special permit to pass through Hong Kong. Those visiting relatives are also exempt from providing a guarantee and are given a special permit with a limited period of stay. However, the regulations are still very strict for those coming to Hong Kong for employment. If a guarantee from an employer is not obtained, the permit will be refused. Therefore, the address on the application form must be written in detail.

(5) A special permit (Entry Permit Special Terms) is an entry permit with a short validity period, specifying the purpose of coming to Hong Kong, the place of origin, the date of departure from Hong Kong, the validity period, and the number of valid entries. In summary, it is impossible to predict what type of permit the department will issue. Sometimes, applications for a two-year permit will result in the issuance of a six-month permit or a special permit. Applications for a six-month permit may only result in a special permit that can be used once. The authority for approval rests with the department.

### Record of Cracking Down on the Terrorist Gang Specializing in Extorting Movie Theaters

The leader has a rice store on Route Paul Henry, and the extortion of the Lafayette Theater provided the clue.

Since movie theaters such as the Jin Cheng and Jin Du in the Public Concession, and the Hu Guang and Lafayette in the French Concession, were successively attacked by thugs throwing smoke bombs and extorting insurance fees, the police authorities, considering these actions as disrupting public order and endangering commerce, immediately ordered their subordinates to arrest the perpetrators to uphold the law. After the Lafayette Theater was bombed by these thugs on the evening of the 5th of this month, it also

Received an Extortion Letter

Demanding an insurance fee of 1,000 yuan, instructing the theater to bring the money to the intersection of Route Cardinal Mercier and Route Keyna in western Shanghai the next day for negotiations. The theater reported this to the police, and the French police sent plainclothes detectives along with special police to arrest the gang's small leader, a Korean named He Bin (32 years old), nicknamed "Little Korea," at that location. He was taken to the police station for investigation. Subsequently, through the efforts of Chinese Detective Yue Sixiang, Detectives Chen Jigen and Jing Hexiang of the Criminal Division of the police station, it was discovered that the gang was hiding in the Public Concession, in the

East Asia Hotel

Room 424, where the thugs Shen Rengxi (from Pudong, 24 years old), Ma Xuewen (45 years old) were arrested. Subsequently, based on their confessions, Huang Xiangsheng (18 years old) and Hu Chengjian (24 years old), and Cai Jinyuan (35 years old), all from Pudong, were apprehended at 530 Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road. Following that, Xie Yuting (45 years old), a local resident, was arrested at No. 19, Lane 362 on Route Petain. Many threatening documents and wooden stamps with iron-blue gang emblems were seized in the room, and they were all

Brought Back to the Police Station

At the same time, guards were stationed in various places, and more than ten other suspects were subsequently apprehended, totaling twenty-two individuals. They were all investigated together. After investigation, it was learned that except for the above seven, the others were all unrelated and were released. During the investigation, the police station, because it still had to strictly arrest the gang leader, Chen Wangwu (formerly the captain of the police detachment in Nanhui) from Nanhui, and the deputy leader, Shi Qinqing (Little Korea is Chen's disciple), did not release information about the case. Now that

Chen and Shi

Have fled upon hearing the news, the case is being announced. It is also learned that Chen originally opened a rice store, the Xin Chang Rice Store, at Nos. 77 and 79 on Route Paul Henry. Knowing that the news was urgent, Chen moved the entire store overnight, and his whereabouts are unknown. When the police went to search, the place was empty. Only a dozen small glass bottles filled with phosphorus were found on the second floor and were taken back to the police station for inspection.

### Southeast Hospital Searched by Japanese

Rumor has it that the hospital has been taking in wounded soldiers and is suspected of storing munitions inside.

Around 9 PM the night before last, the Japanese, along with French police personnel, went to the Southeast Hospital at the intersection of Route Saussure and Route du Père Huc to search it. The search yielded no results. It is reported that the reason the Japanese searched the hospital was because it was rumored that the hospital had taken in wounded soldiers during the August 13th Shanghai Battle, so it was suspected that it might have munitions stored inside. However, no contraband was found.

Moving Cars Also Increase in Price

After various car rental companies increased their prices, other smaller car rental companies also increased their prices yesterday. Due to rising oil prices and increased costs, moving car rental companies have also been unable to sustain their original car rental rates. Therefore, they have all announced that they will implement price increases starting yesterday. The rate for a moving car is now 20 yuan per hour, and the rate for a group bus is 25 yuan per hour. In reality, there is no shortage of gasoline in the Shanghai market.

### Letter

Dear Editor, I recently read in your newspaper that yesterday morning, the Japanese, accompanied by police, arrested a Chinese person at No. 16 Ruifuli, Dongzilaihuo Street. It was reported that the Chinese person was out, and the arrest was unsuccessful. This is not in accordance with the facts. My family has lived here for over 30 years, and all the residents are legitimate businessmen. The occurrence of this matter must be a mistake. I am afraid of misunderstandings from all sectors, so I am writing a special letter to correct this. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely, Wu Tangfu, 30.9.16.

Dear Editor, According to Venerable Degu, the abbot of Jing'an Temple, it has been brought to his attention that the Shanghai local news article "Internal Disputes Between Two Major Ancient Temples, Jing'an and Longhua, Heard" published in the 16th of this month's Shen Bao contains the following concerning this temple: "Degu insists that the temple is a family lineage, which can be passed down from master to disciple, disregarding previous government laws and decrees. Yangxi claims that the temple is a 'ten directions' system, which should be presided over by elders from various mountains, Dharma-protecting laymen, and elected abbots." This is alarming. In the past, this temple has been involved in lengthy litigation concerning the shaving of heads and the "ten directions" sectarian dispute. Finally, the Shanghai Provisional Court of the former Shanghai Public Concession (now the Shanghai First Special District District Court) ruled that this temple was a shaving-head sect temple and that the disputed abbotship should be succeeded by the late Master Zhiwen (Case No. 324 of the Sixteenth Year General Docket). The dispute was settled, and peace has reigned since. Even in the conciliation contract established between Yangxi and the late Master in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the first clause stated that "Jing'an Temple is a shaving-head sect temple." The original copy has Yangxi's personal signature and can be reviewed. Therefore, whether this temple is a shaving-head sect or a "ten directions" sect is indisputable. It is laughable that Yangxi suddenly claims that this temple is "ten directions," which is self-contradictory. As for the directives of the Ministry of Interior and the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Government cited by him, it remains questionable whether they are authentic. Even assuming they are, judicial independence is a major principle of the rule of law. A court's final judgment is not subject to or affected by the approval or orders of administrative authorities. Anyone with legal knowledge knows this. After the late Master's passing, Degu naturally succeeded as abbot. The court is a part of the Chinese government, and the effect of its final judgment extends not only to this temple. This temple complies with the legal judgment of the legal court. How can it be called "disregarding previous government laws and decrees"? Furthermore, although Yangxi once served as the temple's supervisor (in an advisory capacity) in the 18th year of the Republic of China, when Yangxi and the late Master litigated last year, the court determined that Yangxi's supervisory status no longer existed and violated the regulations on supervising temples. (Case No. 259 of the Litigation Docket of the First Special District District Court of the 29th year, Case No. 205 of the High Court Second Branch of the 29th year, Case No. 51 of the Shanghai Anti-Appeal Docket of the Supreme Court Shanghai Special Zone Branch of the 29th year). This shows that Yangxi is no longer the temple's supervisor and has no right to speak on matters concerning the temple. It should be stated that this temple is a shaving-head sect temple, while Yangxi is a "ten directions" monastic forest sect. Since the sects are different, there is no room for him to interfere in any affairs of this temple. In addition to this temple's advertisement, which also contains a detailed explanation in the Shen Bao, and since Yangxi's arbitrary defamation of the late Master has a special clause in the criminal law for punishing such actions, we will separately plan to handle it in accordance with the law. Therefore, we have specially entrusted your lawyer to send a letter to the Shen Bao, requesting a correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Lawyer Zhou Xiao'an, September 16.

### The Salvation Army's Work of Sheltering Beggars Becomes Increasingly Difficult: Many Beggars Are Unwilling to Give Up Their Original Lives, and Beggar Children Are Even More Rebellious and Difficult to Manage

According to the Continental News, the Salvation Army in Shanghai is currently sheltering street beggars and teaching them ways to make a living and become self-reliant. This task is quite challenging. According to Major Walker, head of the Salvation Army in Shanghai, the Salvation Army cannot eliminate street beggars, just as hospitals cannot cure all the diseases of Shanghai. The Salvation Army can only promise to treat beggars

Individually

with the utmost sincerity. Since handling beggars, the Salvation Army has cared for more than 2,800 beggars. The Salvation Army's beggar shelters are not "clearing houses." Depending on the circumstances, in cooperation with the police, villagers who have strayed into Shanghai are sent back to their hometowns. Young and strong beggars are allowed to find guarantors and leave the shelter to find their own livelihoods. Beggar children are kept in the shelter and taught education and crafts such as clothing making and shoe making. Female beggars in the shelter embroider gloves and wash clothes. A small number of stronger male beggars work on breaking stones and can earn 15 yuan per month, which is given to them when they leave the shelter. The difference between refugee and beggar relief

is that refugees are willing, while beggars are often unwilling to give up their begging lives. Therefore, they resist entering the shelter as if they were being arrested and imprisoned. Moreover, many beggars are drug addicts and do not have access to drugs after entering the shelter. Many beggars are also petty thieves, especially beggar children. Of the 250 beggars in the shelter, a small number specialize in stealing cotton, rice, and other items from trucks. They would rather endure the beatings of the guards than steal a small amount of cotton and rice and escape. The beggars also suffer from disease,

blindness, and disability. Blind beggars are a serious problem. They have little hope of being taught a livelihood skill or becoming self-reliant. Without the ability to work, they have no other desire than to beg. These unfortunate beggars are currently kept in the shelter and are not allowed to go out, but there is hope that a solution will be found soon. Many disabled and weak beggars are also unwilling to stay in the shelter. Another serious problem encountered by the Salvation Army is homeless, wandering beggar children. Although their crimes are small, they are large in scale. When admitted to the shelter, they are not afraid at all and even disobey instructions. There have been

groups of beggar children

who smashed the windows of the shelter and were extremely stubborn. The police had to be called to restrain them. On another occasion, the beggar children refused to attend classes. The shelter then took resolute measures and withheld food, and the beggar children were willing to attend school. After patient persuasion, their bad habits were greatly changed. In the vocational school of the shelter, beggar children have already made 500 pairs of shoes and 1,000 pieces of clothing, and recently they have also been making bamboo products. As for those who come to Shanghai from the countryside and beg, the police are certainly unable to identify them, and there is no way to know the past history of the beggars. However, after being sent to the shelter, the shelter strictly questions their backgrounds. Those who are

villagers begging mostly say that the situation in the countryside is unfavorable, forcing them to come to Shanghai to make a living. Whenever the Salvation Army encounters this kind of beggar, it takes a photo of them, obtains a pass, and sends them to the station or ship, giving them a ticket and one yuan in cash to return to their hometowns. More than 400 people have been sent back. According to the police investigation, no beggar has been found to be begging here again after being sent back, and some have even written letters to the Salvation Army from their hometowns to express their gratitude. Major Walker, who succeeded Brigadier-General Murray as head of the Salvation Army in the Shanghai area, has worked in charity in North China and has a lot of experience in refugee and beggar relief work.

Commercial News

### Financial News: Large Amounts of US Dollars Coming, Moving Them Inside Dong Guan Gate and Locking the West is Not Easy. Don't Forget the Past Lesson of British Bank Notes, Don't Worry About Empty Dumplings.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable trends in British and American gold pounds and British remainder notes. US dollar notes rose sharply, once reaching as high as 22 yuan, and finally closing at 21.95 yuan, a gain of 4.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Since the freezing of US remittances, there have been rumors in the market that large amounts of US dollar notes will be transported to Shanghai. This is based on the general speculative psychology that although US remittances can be frozen, US dollar notes are cash and can be used to buy and sell American goods as a substitute for large amounts of US remittances. However, it is not known where these large amounts of US remittances come from. Some say they are being moved from Hong Kong, but it is not known whether Hong Kong will allow them to be transferred. Under the current situation of moving them inside Dong Guan Gate and locking the west, transporting paper money is not an easy task. Even if they can be transported, it should be known that a country's banknotes are not a circulating currency in a foreign country. The example of British pound notes is a lesson to be learned. Moreover, it is not known whether American merchant banks will continue to accept US dollar notes as usual. Some people are still thinking of hoarding US dollar notes, and the opposite side is taking the opportunity to promote them and profit from them. Regardless of whether it is true or false, they will first use an empty dumpling to whet people's appetites and then see the situation before preparing, so that the US dollar note trade can be temporarily grand and prosperous. This is a good business strategy. In addition, Hong Kong notes showed a stable trend, and the market price was stable. Japanese gold notes showed a downward trend, falling to 2.31 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes showed a firm trend, rising to 1.91 yuan in the evening market.

### Another Theory About Black Market Exchange: Imported Goods That Are Not Necessities Will Be Paid For in US Dollars

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw stable central and HSBC exchange rates. There were still few applicants for HSBC's small counter price. The black market for British and American currencies reported calm again. Import foreign companies that are not allowed to apply for non-essential goods are still secretly active, but it is difficult to find opponents. There were no transactions heard of all day. The market price of British exchange was 2 shillings, 8.4375 pence flat, and the price of US dollars was 4.825, long 0.0625. Speculative bulls and bears who have not settled this month are still waiting for a solution to settle. It is said that for imported goods with orders that are not necessities, the amount of goods can be paid in US dollar notes converted to Taiwan-US exchange. According to reliable sources, a British merchant bank in this city will soon transport 3 million US dollars to the United States, and a German merchant bank advanced 100,000 US dollar notes yesterday.

Hong Kong, 16th (Tuesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened dull this morning, and all currencies showed no honor or disgrace.

Tianjin, 16th (Tuesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London telegraphic transfer tight 0.0625, for 3 pence 0.0625. New York telegraphic transfer and Shanghai exchange were unchanged. Lian banknotes opened at 1.23 yuan, for 49.62 yuan.

### Gold Market: Only Adorned by Spot Goods, Prices Rise by 110 Yuan

Yesterday's melted red black market turned to rising, because the temporary compromise between the United States and Japan has nothing to do with the Far East. The hearts of all parties have strengthened again. There were less than 200 taels of futures traded. The price rose from 6,858 yuan to 6,872 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan. Cash turned to rising again, because the price after closing last night had already been raised. Therefore, Zhongxing sold 10 taels to Chida, and the price rose to 8,900 yuan, an increase of 60 yuan. Russia then sold 20 taels to Defu for 8,890 yuan, 30 taels for 8,910 yuan. Defu then advanced Fukang and Yong 10 taels. Zhongxing advanced 30 taels, 8,920 yuan. Yongcheng advanced Chengji and Yifeng 50 taels each for 8,950 yuan. Yiyuan advanced Yifeng 20 taels, 8,950 yuan, 50 taels 8,935 yuan, and another 50 taels 8,930 yuan. Then Lianxing advanced 10 taels, 8,950 yuan. Yongcheng advanced Xianghe 60 taels, Yifeng 50 taels, 8,955 yuan. At noon, Xianghe advanced Yifeng 30 taels, Litai 20 taels, and Hesheng 10 taels.

### Securities Market Update: Domestic Debt Market's Long Rally Pauses, Foreign Stock Markets Rife with Rumors

Yesterday's public debt dark market saw a halt to the rising trend. Although both Xinfu and Tongkang continued to buy, the market lacked unified sentiment. Selling orders exceeded buying orders, causing a straight-line decline in market conditions. Type C bonds nearly broke the two-yuan mark, showing a weakening trend, making it difficult to see improvement in the short term. Signs of wavering market sentiment were evident. It remains to be seen whether the two-yuan level for Type C bonds can be maintained.

Yesterday morning, Xinhua, Xinfu, and Tongkang consistently bought, while sellers included Jiucheng, Lianyi, Renfeng, Xie Kang, Ding Kang, Shuntai, and others. Type C bonds opened at two yuan and seven jiao, briefly saw a small price of two jiao and a half, and although the midday close was at three jiao and a half, it was a weak recovery. At the midday close, Xinfu and Tongkang still had residual buying power, and Lianhe, Runli, Delong, Le Mao, Yiji, and others also had demand. Ding Kang continued to sell, while Yitai and Shengda heavily sold off, attracting attention. Tongshen San Kai, Xiexing Yuan, and others were also eager to sell. Type C bonds fell as low as two yuan, closing at only two yuan and one jiao. The trend is weakening, and further declines are feared. Market prices uniformly fell by three to six jiao. Transactions totaled two hundred and thirty to forty yuan. A summary table is provided below:

Stock Trading: Transactions included Great China Fire Insurance Company shares, one hundred shares, at a price of forty-six yuan and seven jiao and a half.

The general stock market opened strong but soon softened. There were many twists and turns mid-session, and the final result was slightly lower than the previous close. Market sentiment remains positive. However, because various stocks had experienced several days of sharp gains, prices seemed quite high. Consequently, any rumors could trigger a sudden shift in sentiment. The future remains uncertain, depending on the overall situation.

London, 15th (Monday) Telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks showed only bank stocks gaining. The new price of Mercantile Bank shares, after dividend deduction, was £9 10s. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's London-registered shares rose half a pound to £77 10s. Hong Kong-registered shares rose six pounds to £85. There were offers but no buyers. The rest remained unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn & Cloth: Peace Rumors Turn into Smoke Screen, Bulls Anxious to Buy, Ignoring Weak Sales

Yesterday's heavily declined yarn and cloth market recovered in the afternoon. This was due to rumors in the market that the U.S.-Japan agreement was again elusive. This improved the sentiment of speculators. The wind shifted slightly, with covering and renewed buying occurring simultaneously. However, actual transactions did not show significant progress. A Hong Kong group bought 150 bales of coarse yarn. No other transactions were reported. Prices for 32-count and 42-count yarns continued to decline. The situation for Japanese yarn is weakening. Therefore, given the current situation, the market is expected to fluctuate. A significant uptrend is unlikely.

The high price for Double Horse 20-count yarn was 1,732 yuan, the low price was 1,715 yuan. The afternoon opened roughly flat at 1,732 yuan. The price gradually rose with the exchange price, climbing to 1,744 yuan. The closing price was 1,740 yuan.

Double Horse opened this morning, continuing the upward trend from the previous day's close. The opening price was 1,715 yuan. As soon as the price opened, covering rushed in, immediately pushing the price to 1,723 yuan. Afterwards, the exchange opened higher, boosting market sentiment and driving the price to 1,732 yuan. However, sales were sluggish, fluctuating around 1,728-29 yuan. The closing price was 1,728 yuan. Total transactions for half a day were estimated at 8,130 bales. The amount purchased by each group is listed as follows:

Hong Kong: 130 bales
Counterparts: 8,000 bales
Total: 8,130 bales

The Jin Double Horse futures market experienced a sharp rise after a fall amidst confusing news. The rebound was particularly strong. The total fluctuation for the day reached 11 to 18 yuan. The morning opening was initially weak due to further declines in U.S. cotton prices. Mill orders fell first, and sentiment for yarn futures declined accordingly. Short positions and long positions both heavily sold. Later, as the exchange gradually strengthened, selling pressure decreased. Mill orders rebounded in a straight line, and yarn futures rose sharply. Large investors who had been observing quietly saw the rapid decline in recent days and considered the price quite low. Therefore, as soon as an upward trend appeared, they competed to buy. Moreover, the peace rumors that the market had feared for days, lacking strong confirmation, inevitably caused the basis for short positions to waver. Long positions, aware of the fundamental scarcity of cotton and the firmness of prices, rushed to cover and increase their positions. New long positions were particularly active in buying. Therefore, the market price was initially weak but later firm. If further confusing news emerges, the potential for selling may temporarily weaken. The ground has already stabilized.

The opening price for September futures was 1,650 yuan, for October futures 1,659 yuan, and for November futures 1,677 yuan. The afternoon saw a recovery, and the results were: September futures closed at 1,657 yuan, up 4.5 yuan; October futures at 1,673 yuan, up 3.5 yuan; and November futures at 1,682 yuan, a significant increase of 15 yuan. A table is provided below:

### Yarn and Cloth Improves, Cotton Market Active

The raw cotton market was initially very mediocre. In the afternoon, the yarn market recovered, bringing a positive atmosphere. Trading also suddenly became active. The rumors of Pacific peace talks remain uncertain. Shanghai's inventory is not high. New domestic cotton has been damaged by recent wind and rain, and the output is not expected to be abundant. Yesterday's yarn and cloth prices improved, and mills gradually became more receptive, influencing market sentiment and transforming doubt into certainty. The business situation suddenly became enthusiastic.

The New York cotton market declined slightly due to aggressive selling by Southern groups, a lack of significant buyers, and a better-than-expected weather report. Yesterday's opening price was down 18-19 points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to spot traders selling, then rebounded due to short covering. However, the market ultimately fell again due to cotton merchant selling and long liquidation. The closing price was down 6-7 rupees across the board. The opening today is expected to continue declining by about one rupee.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was dull, with few transactions. This is likely due to unresolved foreign exchange settlement issues and the difficulty of obtaining shipping tonnage for cotton imports. Currently, there is little development.

### Grains: Small Parboiled Rice Nearing 100 Yuan, Further Declines of Three to Five Yuan

Yesterday, the foreign rice market opened in the morning carrying the weak momentum from the previous evening. Both futures and spot rice were uniformly weak and listless. Actual sales were cautious, and hoarders were nervous. Those holding inventory were eager to sell at market prices to settle early. The market was filled with calls to sell, while buyers were few. The market was difficult to improve. As rumors of a U.S.-Japan compromise became more prevalent in the market, long positions competed to liquidate. Major players were quietly selling heavily, and the market fell further. Although there were genuine buyers taking advantage of low prices, the market price was ultimately unable to recover. Broken rice fell to 76.5 yuan. Small parboiled rice from banks and warehouses fell to 100 yuan. General cargo from foreign warehouses fell into the 100-yuan range, opening at 98 yuan. Java red rice from inland groups also declined, opening at 97 yuan. Java white rice from Tianjin fell from 118 yuan to 116 yuan. British-Chinese Company's small-grained rice opened at 129.5 yuan. Spot broken rice was only 88.5 yuan, a decline of 3-5 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Although there was demand from genuine buyers and hoarders taking advantage of the low prices in the afternoon, the market price rose and fell again, unable to stabilize. The entire day's trading volume was 8-9,000 bags of spot rice and over 200 tons from the British-Chinese Company. Today, 1,400 bags of foreign rice are being shipped to Tianjin on the Taikoo's New Beijing vessel.

Thick and thin japonica domestic rice, facing the sharp decline in foreign rice prices, was also significantly affected, causing stalls in local stores to become stagnant and stale. Although goods were scarce, it was difficult for holders to maintain prices, and they fell by 2-3 yuan across the board. South Port early rice sold for 148 yuan, then 145 yuan. Thick japonica rice did not open. New Pudong japonica rice was 151.5 yuan, then 151 yuan.

Glutinous rice was also in freefall, unable to stabilize, declining by around 2 yuan across the board. Hong Kong special glutinous rice opened at 126 yuan, ordinary glutinous rice at 123-120 yuan, and glutinous tea rice at 110 yuan.

### Seafood: Newly Arrived Local Products Open Lower

Newly arrived local products in Hong Kong have recently arrived and were opened yesterday, priced at 444 yuan, which is relatively cheap.

After falling back, dried scallops opened yesterday at 1,205 yuan. Based on the asking price, this is a decrease of 200 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Market Manipulation Severely Profitable, Continuous Arrivals: Market Prices Soaring

Yesterday, the sugar market saw renewed buying interest due to difficulties in foreign exchange settlement, pushing prices upward. The guild's clearing price for spot 24 coarse white sugar for September entry was 131 yuan, 32 yuan, 34.6 jiao, up 4.6 jiao. For August, it was 130 yuan, 31.8 jiao, 34 yuan, up 4.5 jiao. For July, it was 131.4 jiao, 33.6 jiao, up 4.1 jiao. Old cargo for March was 130 yuan, February was 128.5 yuan. Hong Kong cargo rose from 122 yuan to 25 yuan. Dutch red opened at 123 yuan, then 24 yuan in the afternoon, up 1 yuan. Taikoo vehicle white B mark was 162 yuan, up 2 yuan. HHX mark was 142 yuan, also up 2 yuan. Company futures for 24 coarse white sugar for September 20th was 128.4 jiao, 30.5 jiao, 31 yuan, 32.3 jiao, 33 yuan, up 3.9 jiao. For the 30th, it was 131.2 jiao, 32.7 jiao, 33.1 jiao, 32.5 jiao, up 1.8 jiao. Total transactions for futures and spot goods were over 50,000 bags.

A large quantity of Dutch sugar arrived in Shanghai. The Java Mail Steamship Company's Zesaruya arrived at noon yesterday. The entire ship was loaded with sugar, totaling 7,000 tons or over 70,000 bags. It docked at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. Today, 6,000 bags of sugar are being shipped to Tianjin on the Taikoo's New Beijing vessel.

### Piece Goods: Japanese Cotton Cloth Selling Well in Southeast Asia, Rising Trend Intensifies

The factory cloth market saw a strong rebound yesterday. In the morning, the market hovered and rose slightly. Demand from Hong Kong increased. Factory sources were very tight. Dyeing factories and speculators showed strong buying interest. The market rebounded. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill cloth rose 0.5 to 0.75 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth and velvet rose 0.5 to 1 yuan. Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth factory quoted futures prices 1.5 to over 3 yuan higher than current spot prices per piece. Over 1,000 pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers bought over 500 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Southeast Asian brokers bought over 400 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse and fine cloth from factories such as Lun Chang and Jardine Matheson.

The rising trend for Dong cloth has reignited, with futures showing particular strength. Actual sales of mid- to low-grade fine cloth and twill cloth continue to be strong on this street. Selling prices are stable. The goods shipped from Shanghai to the southern islands. The exchange's futures cloth grades are still about 2 yuan lower per piece. Therefore, those shorting the market are cautious and eager to cover. Prices for all months have been pushed up, rebounding by about 0.8-0.9 yuan per piece. The leading fine cloth new orders in the spot market are still selling for 58.3 yuan. Si Jun Zi serge was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with new orders closing at 1.25 yuan, up 0.0275 yuan per yard.

On the 17th, 200 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, and another 4 pieces were shipped to Weihaiwei.

### Ten Years

— Yu Gong

What dims the soul is parting. In terms of human sentiment, one day feels like three autumns, let alone ten years. I think all those experiencing separation share this feeling.

Remembrance, encouragement, and expectation arise from the bottom of one's heart when fathers and sons, brothers, and friends bid farewell, especially for those who have been separated for a long time, this feeling is even more profound.

Historically speaking, the past feels like yesterday, and ten years is but a fleeting moment. The short ten years since the founding of China is only one five-hundredth of its history. Looking at the lessons that history provides, the Chinese nation has a long-standing culture and a glorious history. Any difficulties or hardships are factors that encourage us to move forward, to develop and flourish. Therefore, these ten years of hardship are the inevitable experiences in creating a bright future.

Ten years, precious ten years, joyful, delightful, inspiring, and moving ten years. As the saying goes, "Ten years of accumulation, ten years of instruction." Since its history, the Chinese nation has endured hardship, hoping that ten years will be the foundation for revitalization. Looking at the past and comparing it to the present, the more difficult history is, the more brilliant it becomes!

### Many Blessings, Many Years, Many Sons: I am the Father of Seven Children

— Gen Fa

"You are now going out into society! In the future, two will become three, and three will become four. The burden will become heavier and heavier. You must work harder, be thrifty, persevere, and endure hardship. Being a person is not easy!" This was the instruction my old father gave us fifteen years ago when we left our hometown to come to Shanghai.

Fifteen years have passed! As expected: endlessly, every two years, another one. Now, two has become nine!

Leading this group, moving south and north, going east and falling west. When renting houses, nine out of ten families dislike having too many children and refuse to rent to us. Buying clothes means buying seven pieces at a time. In the mornings, we struggle to find food, buying seven or eight large pancakes, with each person only getting one. Visiting relatives, walking on the streets, it's a continuous line, a group of people, resembling a picture of refugees. Now, we have finally found a garage, the whole family crammed inside like sardines. The ladies in the giant buildings across the street, hearing the children crying, have come down several times to reprimand us, threatening to drive out this family of noisy children with too many people.

This group of little refugees has no enjoyment, no entertainment, no security. People have three wives and four concubines, surrounded by attendants. We are cramped in the alleys, with no branch to perch on. People have medical care, diagnoses, milk, and supplements. We eat thin porridge and endure illness. People have schools and opportunities, considering studying a hardship and education a dreaded path. We pass by schools every day, unable to enter. It seems that besides maintaining these few small lives, there is no other future, no other hope in the world. However, there is always hope, I believe. The great men who shook the world in history mostly grew up in humble, difficult, and thorny environments. Therefore, we comfort ourselves and are unwilling to underestimate ourselves. Among the seven children, there will always be one who succeeds. We try our best to save some money, planning to cultivate the most hardworking, most studious, and most progressive one. We place all our hopes for the future on him. Amidst the present worries and hardships, we are nurturing future comfort and happiness.

(Editor's Note) Mr. Gen Fa, please allow me to express great sympathy for the difficulties you face in bringing "this group of little refugees." It is truly not easy during these times. But I admire your optimism even more. Only with optimism can you fight and cope with ease. Although your children suffer, they have an equal opportunity to succeed, so they will equally amount to something. However, please educate them universally, encouraging them to "do their best." If there's porridge, everyone eats porridge; if there's rice, everyone eats rice. Singling out one and placing all your hopes on him is the stance of a "speculator." You have a father's obligations. We hope no one will say you are unfair, wouldn't you agree?

### Skilled at "Rejecting Trouble"

— Jiang Ting

It is said that a nation "skilled at rejecting trouble" is an excellent nation, and its life will be infinite.

If everyone in the world could reject trouble, wouldn't the world be at peace? I once thought this, but I cannot guarantee that everyone among the 1.6 billion people in the world is willing to reject trouble. As long as a small minority of people are not afraid of "trouble," the world will immediately become unsettled. Look, the world only had one Hitler who was not afraid of trouble, and even Americans across the ocean had to busy themselves because of him. Although everyone seeks peace and dislikes trouble, how can one reject trouble while living in today's world?

However, human nature seems to dislike trouble, but the world's current state, the progress of humanity, and the development of culture are also the results of people not being afraid of trouble. All inventions, all creations, are troublesome, not just ordinary trouble, but extremely troublesome. I have not heard of any scientist who is afraid of trouble, and I have never heard of any scholar or successful person who is afraid of trouble.

Humanity's progress is due to not being afraid of trouble, and the development of culture is also due to humanity's not being afraid of trouble.

In modern society, one cannot be afraid of trouble; to survive in the modern world, one cannot be afraid of trouble.

If you reject trouble and dislike trouble, it means that you are worthless and unprogressive.

### Certainty

— Bai Mo

I go to the head cinema every day, and people think I have money? But to be blunt, the reason I go is not to watch movies, but to pretend to look at the preview photos, enjoy some free entertainment, and use it as a place to escape from烦恼.

Swimming pools and skating rinks without women, massage parlors, game arcades, and grand hotels without female attendants will never be prosperous.

However, if a dance hall bans men, that dance hall will soon be declared closed.

Anecdotes

### Characters in the Civet Cat Case

— Liu Tang

2.  Empress Liu

Generally, women with outstanding talent and beauty are both sweet and sour, fragrant and spicy, capable of making heroes fall into their trap, playing them in the palm of their hand, and succumbing to their charm. However, Empress Liu is still a typical figure, not comparable to the licentious, cruel, ungrateful, and unjust Wu Zetian. When she was in power, the small official Fang Zhonggong submitted a memorial requesting the establishment of a Liu clan temple based on Wu Zetian's story, and Cheng Lin also presented a picture of Wu Zetian attending court. The empress threw his book on the ground and said: I will not do this to betray my ancestors. It can be seen that Empress Liu's expulsion was nothing more than being seduced by sensual pleasures. The fact that many sons born in the harem did not survive cannot be attributed to Empress Liu alone, as Empress Liu was still among the concubines in her early years. Later, there was a child raised outside, greatly implying that only a son of Empress Liu could become the heir to Emperor Zhenzong; this was Empress Liu's fault. Emperor Zhenzong loved and feared Empress Liu, complying with her wishes in every way, which is undeniable. However, Emperor Renzong was able to enjoy the glory of the emperor peacefully for forty-one years, thanks to the nurturing and protection of Empress Liu, which would have been difficult to obtain otherwise.

Empress Liu's shortcoming was her inability to bear children. Beauty without offspring, as described in the Odes, Empress Liu must have shared the same sentiment! Therefore, what she deeply desired in her heart was to have a son to secure her power and exclusive favor. Emperor Renzong was born seven years after the death of Crown Prince Daoxian. During this period, Empress Liu must have still hoped to have children herself. Later, realizing that she would never be able to do so, she thought of having Consort Li serve Emperor Zhenzong; Empress Liu was already forty-two years old when Emperor Renzong was born. Otherwise, with Empress Liu's refusal to allow others to share her husband's affections, how could she tolerate someone else sleeping next to her bed. Under the patriarchal system, the illegitimate son considers the primary wife as his mother, especially in the royal family. Therefore, Empress Liu actually tolerated Consort Li's favor, hoping that she would have a son, still with the intention of keeping power within her grasp.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

12. Unexpected Turmoil

"Ah! Second Brother, is that you?... You are... when did you arrive?" One afternoon, he accidentally woke up from a drowsy state and suddenly felt as if there was someone else in the room. He tried his best to open his tired eyes to look around; one glance made him immediately excited, as the person pacing back and forth in front of his bed was none other than Zhao Yukun, his only old friend for the past twenty or thirty years.

Yukon was still very thin, as small as a monkey, and his clothes were as old and worn as usual, but his expression was not as cheerful as usual; hearing Begonia greet him, he did not say anything funny, only nodded slightly.

"Little Dog's brother just told me everything about your family!" He continued to walk around the room non-stop. "Although things are annoying, you don't have to get so upset. Now that I'm here, I'll have to give you an idea. But the most important thing is to take care of you first! Just now when you were asleep, I saw that you didn't look too good. When Zhang Laoliu brings Dr. Jiao over, you must take some medicine and rest well..."

Before Zhao Yukon could finish speaking, Begonia was already shaking his head on the pillow.

"Who... who wants to invite... what... doctor?... If Mei Bao... doesn't come back... how can my body... get better...!" (213)

### A Report on a Costume Ice Skating Show

— Shen

The day before yesterday was the annual grand costume ice skating show at the Wing On Skating Rink. This reporter attended and will provide the following details: From 3:00 PM, the seats around the rink were completely occupied by spectators. Those who arrived later had to stand at the back. At that time, there was a foreign couple in the center of the rink wearing white Western-style suits, performing various small tricks similar to those of Sonja Henie. When lively music was transmitted through the microphone, they would embrace and dance out the steps of a tango or waltz. One beat, one step; one step, one curve, like birds in the sky and fish in the pond, beautiful and lively, touching the heartstrings of everyone, and triggering a burst of enthusiastic applause.

At 7:00 PM, the costume ice skating began. This time, the program was "Sanben Tie Gongji" (Three Iron Roosters), featuring "Burning Xiang the Adult". Zhang Jiaxiang was played by Ding Jinfu, the ice skating team coach, and Xiang the Adult was played by Shen Weide, the ice skating team captain. These two are both veterans of the ice rink, and their acting, stage presence, skills, and poses were all breathtaking. When Zhang Jiaxiang appeared on stage with a saddle, jumping and shaking, he was both滑稽 and稳重, demonstrating his extraordinary skill in every move. Xiang the Adult's demeanor and lines gave people a relaxed feeling. "Burning Xiang the Adult" featured real swords and guns, and the ice skates raced east, west, south, and north, creating a tense and thrilling atmosphere, making it one of the most exciting scenes.

### Brief Biographies from the Pear Garden

— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrations by Zhang Yizhang

(Forty) Ye Shengzhang

Martial clowns traditionally played a supporting role to martial actors, rarely capable of leading a performance. Ye Shengzhang was the first to change that and headline as a martial clown. Shengzhang studied under Wang Changlin, and his rendition of "Hitting the Melon Circle" was considered the most accurate imitation of Changlin. Furthermore, Shengzhang excelled in acrobatics and tumbling, with agility surpassing Changlin's even in his prime. He closely rivaled the deceased Zhang Heijian, with few ever surpassing them. (His "San Cha Kou" is excellent.) However, his voice was hoarse, and his delivery was particularly poor. Martial clowns, commonly known as "opening jumpers," rely on martial skills to showcase their talent. However, without clear articulation and crisp pronunciation, and a forceful, decisive delivery, it is impossible to fully convey the character's emotions. Focusing solely on martial skills is a mistake. In the past thirty years, Zhang Hei and Wang Changlin have been widely regarded as the leading "opening jumpers." Based on what I have witnessed, no one has surpassed them. However, Zhang Hei's later years were spent in Tianqiao, and his twilight years were pitiful. Changlin's reputation, on the other hand, continued to grow, surpassing his former glory. Although their skills were comparable, their fates differed greatly. Just as I was lamenting Zhang Hei's misfortune, I see the prominence of Ye Shengzhang today, whose influence far exceeds Changlin's during his lifetime. What more can I say? Nevertheless, martial clowns have historically been undervalued. Shengzhang's rise has slightly shifted this perception, allowing a suppressed art form to express itself, which is a welcome development. -- End of Brief Biographies from the Pear Garden --

### Jade Flowers in a Rain of Blood

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter Sixteen: Taking the Beloved Bird Out of Its Cage Early

San Gui nodded and said, "The rebel forces are expanding daily, like a fire spreading across the plains. A full-scale suppression is absolutely necessary. I only lament that the previous officials in charge of suppressing the bandits were utterly useless, failing one after another at the hands of the rebels. Not only did they achieve nothing, but they also squandered a great deal of the nation's money and manpower. They are truly incompetent ministers who have harmed the country, a matter of regret and lament. This time, I have been ordered by the Emperor to move a portion of the troops from outside the Pass to the capital to defend the throne and suppress the bandits. This is also the responsibility of us military officials, so I must depart from the Pass in a day or two to make arrangements." Tian Hongyu said with pleasure, "This old man also hopes that the General will leave the Pass as soon as possible and transfer troops here to protect the capital. Not only will the Emperor be reassured and the capital secured, but this old man will also be able to sleep soundly. I hope the General will take care of my family. I would be most grateful." After speaking, he filled a cup of wine and offered it to San Gui. San Gui held the wine cup and said, "I am grateful for your Excellency's esteem for me. In the future, I will definitely send troops to specially protect your esteemed residence. However, I have a presumptuous request, and I hope your Excellency will grant it." Tian Hongyu asked, "What instructions does the General have? As long as it is within my power, I will comply." San Gui smiled slightly and pointed his left hand towards Yuanyuan, saying, "I have no other love in my life, only for beauty. Yuanyuan is a beauty from Jiangnan, whom I have always admired, but my pursuit has been fruitless, causing me great anxiety. If your Excellency would extend your love to others and generously bestow Yuanyuan upon me, then my gratitude would be beyond words. In the future, if there is a rebel invasion, I will do my utmost to protect your Excellency's family, even before protecting the country. With your Excellency's magnanimity, I trust you will believe my words? Please agree to my request quickly." After San Gui said these words, Yuanyuan lowered her head, appearing both shy and pleased. Tian Hongyu, on the other hand, became extremely embarrassed. If he agreed to San Gui's request, the beauty he had acquired with such difficulty would be given to another man to enjoy, which would leave him inconsolable. But if he did not agree, he was relying on San Gui for protection and would have to concede to his demands. (172)
