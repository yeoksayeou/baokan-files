### American Property in Chongqing Destroyed; Grew Lodges Strong Protest with Japanese Foreign Minister; British Ambassador to Japan Visits Ohashi to Protest Bombing of British Embassy in Chongqing

Tokyo: U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, has lodged a strong protest with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka regarding the bombing yesterday by Japanese aircraft in Chongqing of the U.S. Embassy Chancellery, the U.S. Army Attaché Office, the U.S. Embassy, and the Standard Oil Company. Grew issued the protest after receiving a detailed report from U.S. Ambassador to China, Gauss, on the damage inflicted on American property in Chongqing by Japanese aircraft. Gauss's report stated that no Americans were killed or injured in the Japanese air raid on Chongqing yesterday. However, a bomb landed within a few feet of the new U.S. Army Attaché Office, located between the U.S. Embassy and the American warship "Tutilla" berthed in the river. The U.S. Army Attaché Office was destroyed and the U.S. Embassy, the American warship "Tutilla," and the American Naval Bar were lightly damaged. A poorly constructed air raid shelter near the U.S. Embassy was hit, killing over thirty Chinese. Five bombs landed within three hundred yards of the U.S. Ambassador and the "Tutilla," one of which landed within fifty yards of the U.S. Embassy air raid shelter. It is believed that Ambassador Gauss was in the air raid shelter during the attack, although Gauss's report did not mention this. The Chancellery and the U.S. Ambassador's residence were damaged by the violent tremors and flying debris. The Standard Oil Company was also damaged. (June 16th, Associated Press dispatch)

Tokyo: It has been learned today that British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, visited Ohashi, Director-General of the Japanese Foreign Office, on Saturday to protest the recent bombing of the British Embassy in Chongqing by Japanese aircraft. It is understood that the British Ambassador pointed out that the markings on the roof of the British Embassy clearly indicated that it was British official property. During the recent Japanese air raid on Chongqing, six bombs landed within the British Embassy compound, causing significant damage. The buildings of the British Embassy in Chongqing were painted a distinctive yellow color for identification purposes. (June 16th, Associated Press dispatch)

Chongqing: American property suffered the most damage during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing on the 15th. In addition to the destruction of the U.S. Embassy Military Attaché Office and the damage to the gunboat "Tutilla" from bomb fragments, it has been confirmed that the Ambassador's office and the Standard Oil Company office were also damaged. The company stored supplies for the U.S. Navy. (June 16th dispatch)

Chongqing: The Standard Oil Company's warehouse on the south bank of Chongqing was also damaged during yesterday's Japanese air raid. It is understood that the company is considering requesting compensation from the Japanese government. The warehouse is where the American naval bar is located. A bomb exploded just thirty yards from the warehouse, shattering windows and causing a great deal of plaster to fall. The captain of the American warship "Tutilla" hosted American reporters last night, stating that there was no damage to the ship. After dinner, a movie was shown. The ship was affected by the tremors and sustained minimal damage. (June 16th, Associated Press dispatch)

### Change in Central Broadcasting Time, Starting Yesterday

Chongqing: The Central Broadcasting Station has revised its broadcasting schedule starting on the 16th of this month. The midday programs will begin at 6:00 AM. In addition to news reports, the station will add flag-raising ceremonies, calisthenics, and stories of martyrs. The new programs, the recorded news from 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM, and the programs from 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM will be broadcast as usual. (June 16th dispatch)We await deliberation and candid discussion, gathering wisdom and benefiting from all ideas. As this conference opens, I extend my sincere welcome and appreciation. The Ministry convened the First National Financial Conference in July of the 17th year of the Republic [1928]. At that time, the North and South had just been unified, and political tutelage was urgently needed. Financial reorganization was imperative. Furthermore, due to the implementation of tariff autonomy, which had been initially recognized by the U.S. government, and to establish international credibility and reduce the burden on the people, we convened the First National Financial Conference to resolve the abolition of likin [internal transit tax]. However, due to successive disturbances, frequent famines, financial exhaustion, and economic decline, exacerbated by the global economic panic and the sharp increase in trade deficits, farmers and merchants suffered, and both the central and local governments were in dire straits. Recognizing that finance is the lifeblood of the nation, and that the prosperity or decline of the national economy is tied to the nation's tax revenue, I proposed to the Fourth Plenary Session in January of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] to implement the reorganization of land taxes and reduce surcharges in order to alleviate the people's burden and promote economic recovery. In May of the same year, the Second National Financial Conference was convened with the main objectives of (1) abolishing arbitrary taxes and levies and alleviating the people's burden, (2) conducting land surveys and resolving land issues, (3) thoroughly reforming the tax system and reorganizing local tax revenues, and (4) establishing local budgets and emphasizing productive construction. The Ministry has implemented the resolutions within the realm of possibility. (To be continued) (June 16th dispatch)

Editorial

### Venting of Excess Capital

Shanghai's finance can be described as extremely unrestrained today. Head office drafts rise above par, and remittance drafts have returned to rising above par from being at a discount. The strangeness of this situation is unparalleled. In reality, it is not surprising. Money is no different from other commodities. If it is put to good use, it becomes extremely powerful, seemingly invincible. But if it is not put to good use, then gold loses its luster and becomes as worthless as dirt. Therefore, the value of everything depends not only on supply and demand but also on calculation. If the calculation shows a profit, even something cheap is desirable. If the calculation shows no profit, what is the use of something expensive? Today's cash, head office drafts, and remittance drafts are all the same thing. Head office drafts are cash that can be obtained immediately, and remittance drafts are cash that has restrictions on withdrawal. Cash is the mother, and head office drafts and remittance drafts are the children. When children replace their mother, the mother must be at a discount to the children, and how can this not be strange? But analyzing it, it is nothing more than based on the calculation of people's hearts! In the past, it was impossible to obtain cash, so people turned to obtain it through intermediaries, willingly paying a discount of one or two hundred yuan to ensure they got it. Today, however, prices are extraordinarily high, and the transfer of funds is increasingly frequent and large. Cash has the hassle of being counted and the worry of being robbed. In addition, considering the differences in interest rates and the various restrictions, people naturally choose to give up what is difficult and take what is easy, valuing profit over goods. As a result, they inevitably emphasize negotiable instruments. Negotiable instruments are safer, less dangerous, facilitate transfers, save procedures, and save time. This is the reason for rising above par, and cash has lost its luster.

However, cash will ultimately be cash. One day when it contracts, who knows if the discount will not immediately return. Today, we are suffering from the harm of excess. The harm of excess means that excess capital is rampant. Excess capital has its own ways to vent. In the world of legal tender, banknotes and government bonds can be regarded as equivalent. Government bonds can be regarded as wholesale banknotes, and banknotes can be regarded as retail government bonds. If there are too many banknotes, government bonds can be used to absorb them. If there are too few banknotes, they can be released from government bonds. This is the way to balance the ebb and flow of currency. Not only that, with the current low interest rates on deposits and the numerous restrictions on storing head office drafts, how can the free circulation of government bonds, calculated at market prices, not be even more profitable? Government bonds can be regarded as banknotes with interest. However, those who like to speculate believe that although the interest on government bonds is substantial, compared to the profits from hoarding and speculation, which can generate many times the capital, it is insignificant and not worth considering. They do not consider that where there is great profit, there is also great harm. Hoarding and speculation can sometimes lead to great wealth, but they can also lead to the complete loss of one's assets. There is nothing that does not come with both advantages and disadvantages. Government bonds, with their unbreakable creditworthiness, may not offer great profits, but they also do not involve great harm. The Classic of Filial Piety says, "Full but not overflowing, so one can long maintain wealth." Investing in government bonds is the way to achieve fullness without overflowing.

If one is determined to become very rich, it cannot be achieved through speculation. What is gained through speculation is like gambling, "coming in with the waves and going out with the waves," and is difficult to sustain. If one is willing to take great risks in the hope of obtaining great wealth, then why not use the capital for hoarding and speculation to reclaim wasteland, develop treasures, build great undertakings, and establish large properties? The great tycoons of Europe and America, who have dominated the world and achieved prominence, all possessed this entrepreneurial spirit and were good at using their wealth. They used not only their own wealth but also the wealth of the masses. They were not only capable with their own talents and efforts but also gathered the strength of the masses. As a result, no matter how many obstacles they faced or how many dangers they braved, nothing was impossible, no achievement was impossible, and wealth was inevitably accumulated. This is what is meant by seizing the great opportunities of the world, benefiting the country, benefiting the people, benefiting oneself, benefiting others, and leaving a legacy of endless benefits. As for hoarding and speculation, they only know how to exploit the lives of the masses to enrich themselves, harming others and benefiting oneself, without regard for the public. Once the situation changes and the market fluctuates, who knows if ruin will not be imminent? Therefore, those who possess great wealth should have foresight and vision. Today, in the southwest and northwest regions, the wilderness stretches far and wide, the mountains are stacked upon mountains, and the resources are abundant. Wealth is left lying on the ground. It can be said that the ground is full of gold, but it cannot be taken with a snap of the fingers! Therefore, the excess capital that is congested in Shanghai, causing harm due to its excess and having no way to vent, can take this opportunity to gather talent and capital, move capital inward, gain both security and great profits. The current difficulties are only temporary. Moreover, the southwest and northwest are no longer what they used to be. The construction of transportation networks is sufficient to aid the development of industry and commerce. Although the southeast is known as the area of wealth, it has been cultivated and inhabited for thousands of years, and the land's productivity may eventually be exhausted. The future development lies in what people have not previously paid attention to. Manage it, operate it, attract it, and transform rubble into gold. Bring excess capital into the right track. It all depends on people's efforts!

### Germany and Italy Retaliating Against U.S. Asset Freeze; Will Take Similar Actions; Italy Already Investigating American Assets in Italy; Germany Will Implement Previously Drafted Confiscation Order

Rome, June 16th (Associated Press): Premier Mussolini, in retaliation for the U.S. freezing Axis funds in the U.S., ordered the freezing of American assets this morning at 8:00 AM. As a result, American citizens throughout Italy are no longer able to withdraw their deposits from banks.

Rome, June 16th (Associated Press): One thousand American citizens residing in Rome were trying to withdraw deposits from banks today, as they had private funds in various banks. The reason they were trying to withdraw was that the Italian side recently announced that, after President Roosevelt ordered the freezing of German and Italian funds in the U.S., Italy would also retaliate against all American property within Italy. There are currently 5,000 American residents in Italy. It is generally predicted here that the American residents will suffer poverty as a result. An official Italian communique stated that the method of Italian retaliation, to put it plainly, is that whatever measures the U.S. takes against Italy, Italy will take the same measures against the U.S. Currently, an investigation into American property has begun in preparation for confiscation once the U.S. begins freezing Italian funds.

Washington, June 16th (Reuters): It has long been expected here that Italy would take retaliatory action by freezing American assets in Italy. Official circles have not yet issued criticisms, but it is generally believed that this move by Rome is mostly theoretical, as Italy's current monetary controls have already prevented Americans from withdrawing their investments in Italy. The same is true for Germany. It is estimated that American assets in Italy are worth US$143 million, and in Germany, they are worth US$427 million.

Berlin, June 16th (Associated Press): It is widely believed that the order, drafted by Germany more than two months ago, to confiscate American industries in Germany will be implemented immediately in retaliation for President Roosevelt's freezing of Axis funds in the U.S. It is understood that Germany drafted this plan previously, at the time the U.S. confiscated German ships in the U.S., as a means of retaliation, but then abandoned the original plan. It is widely believed that Germany will take retaliatory steps simultaneously with Italy. A spokesperson for authoritative circles refused to comment on this matter and also refused to estimate how much assets Germans have in the U.S.

Washington, June 16th (Associated Press): An official in the legal section of the Treasury Department said yesterday that President Roosevelt's freezing order and the accompanying registration of foreign property in the U.S. will also apply to the Philippines. Section 5 of the order states that the term "enemy country" means "the United States and any place subject to U.S. law."

Berlin, June 16th (Associated Press): German authoritative figures recently stated that the U.S. action of freezing German and Italian deposits is absolutely unjust and stated that German and Italian countermeasures are probably under consideration.

Axis Funds in the U.S. Have Been Evaded

New York, June 16th (Associated Press): It was stated here yesterday that it would be very difficult to accurately compile a register of Axis assets stored in the U.S. Wall Street believes that Axis funds have been cleverly evaded. The huge amount of funds in Swiss institutions is a clear example. Currently, Swiss deposits in the U.S. amount to a massive 1.5 billion, while German deposits are only 300 to 400 million. Some monetary experts believe that Germany and Italy have continued to transfer their frozen funds in recent weeks. Financial officials say that although they know that Swiss assets must include German and Italian investments, it is very difficult to separate German and Italian funds from Swiss assets specifically. They also predict that some other Axis funds have been used by merchants of other nationalities outside of Switzerland to engage in financial activities. Wall Street says that President Roosevelt's freezing of Axis funds can prevent the Axis from accumulating property in the U.S.

German Officials Refuse to Comment

Berlin, June 16th (International News Service): Authoritative sources here have refused to comment on President Roosevelt's order to freeze Axis assets in the U.S. German newspapers have not mentioned the order, as the newspapers and spokespersons are awaiting official instructions.

Japanese Response to U.S. Freezing of Funds

Tokyo, June 16th (Haitong Press): The "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun" today published a dispatch from its New York correspondent, stating that although the U.S. government "has not yet frozen" Japanese deposits in the U.S., this is not a gesture of goodwill from President Roosevelt to improve relations between Japan and the U.S. On the contrary, Japan must prepare for the tendency of the U.S. to increase economic and political pressure. In fact, U.S. authorities are already investigating Japanese property in the U.S.

Britain Expresses Great Welcome to This Move by the U.S.

London, June 16th (Associated Press): There was warm welcome here yesterday for President Roosevelt's freezing of Axis funds in the U.S., as it is believed that this move is a blow to Germany and Italy, and at the same time, it can protect the Western Hemisphere from being infiltrated by the Axis. London also interpreted President Roosevelt's measure as indicating that the U.S. is prepared to eliminate all German attempts in the Americas. The most immediate effect of freezing Axis funds is that the Axis can no longer engage in activities to disrupt the Western Hemisphere. At the same time, all free trade purchases of goods by the Axis around the world will be cut off as a result.

### U.S. Warmly Welcomes British Pilots

London, June 16th (Reuters): The Air Ministry Information Office stated that a large number of British pilot trainees have arrived in the U.S. and have received a warm welcome. The U.S. has been entertaining them generously. Bands have been playing British and American songs and marches. The trainees will never forget this kind of hospitality.

### Netherlands Indies Parliament Opens; Governor-General Delivers Opening Address; Insisting on Not Providing the Enemy with Raw Materials

United Press, Batavia, 16th Dispatch: The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies declared in the National Assembly today that Japan must understand that the Dutch East Indies cannot export raw materials to supply the Axis powers. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, in his address at the opening of the parliament, reviewed the economic negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, stating, "Japan must understand that the most fundamental concepts of our own interests and national responsibility compel us, at any cost, to prevent our exports from directly or indirectly supplying the enemy with urgently needed raw materials. This policy restricts our foreign activities and permits the export of certain raw materials, which is very clear and reasonable. Therefore, we can never consider changing our policy or not actively implementing it." The Governor-General also discussed the national defense plan and the progress of the war, and expressed hope that the Netherlands could be liberated through the victory of the Allied powers. The audience included Dutch, indigenous, and foreign diplomatic personnel.

Reuters, Batavia, 16th Dispatch: According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance of the Dutch East Indies today, the 1941 budget of the Dutch East Indies will be short by 136,700,000 guilders due to the cost of recruiting local indigenous troops and expanding the mechanization of the army, which has already cost 70 million guilders. Defense matters will be accelerated in the next fiscal year, such as expanding and strengthening the Surabaya naval base and increasing the deployment of fleets, all of which will be urgently undertaken. Since 1940, 500 million guilders have been spent on defense expenditures.

Reuters, Batavia, 16th Dispatch: At today's session of the People's Council of the Dutch East Indies for 1941, the Governor-General announced the possibility of political reform in the post-war status of the Dutch East Indies, stating that once the Netherlands regains its freedom, leading figures from all sectors of the country will request the King to grant political reforms to the Dutch East Indies to suit its significance as an important part of the Netherlands. The historical and constitutional ties between the various parts of the Netherlands have been strengthened by the war. The East Indies cannot produce war materials and strictly controls its exports to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. The East Indies has voluntarily contributed 10 million guilders to purchase aircraft.

Reuters, Chongqing, 16th Dispatch: News that the Dutch in London received that the People's Council of the Dutch East Indies, meeting today, will discuss improving trade relations between China and the Dutch East Indies has attracted much attention here. The Central Daily News stated that this news is worthy of our attention, as it comes at a time when economic negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands have broken down. The relationship between China and the Dutch East Indies has a long history, and it is estimated that there are no fewer than 1.2 million Chinese living in the Dutch East Indies, who have contributed significantly to the development of the Dutch East Indies. Subsequently, due to the expansion of Japanese economic influence, trade relations between the two sides declined. Now that this issue has been raised for discussion in the Batavia Parliament, we hope that the Chinese government will pay close attention to it.

### Opening of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association; Speech by Suetsugu; If the United States Actually Participates in the European War, Japan Should Also Prepare to Join the War

Reuters, Tokyo, 16th Dispatch: At the opening of the Central Cooperative Council of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association in Tokyo today, General Suetsugu stated in his address that important issues are rapidly approaching, compelling Japan to make final decisions on the construction of new institutions in government, economics, domestic culture, and life, because international relations are quite tense, the China Incident needs to be resolved as soon as possible, and the United States is about to join the war. He then mentioned the establishment of the Tripartite Pact, stating that the pact was concluded in accordance with the Emperor's will and has become a union of three strong powers that is closely related to the new world order, and does not contain selfish or self-serving motives. Therefore, if the United States, out of its confidence and for the sake of honor, participates in the European War, Japan should also prepare to join the war. He again mentioned the South Seas issue, stating that the issue is a matter of life and death for Greater East Asia, and Japan certainly cannot acquiesce to its current status. He firmly believes that Japan will be the decisive factor in the global war. This is not an easy task for Japan, but the Japanese people will be forced to make extraordinary preparations, so the new institutions in all aspects of national activities must strive to be completed as soon as possible. The Central Cooperative Council is the core of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the driving force of the new national system. Today's first formal meeting was attended by 212 representatives from all sectors of the country, who will handle 242 issues, mostly related to the construction of new institutions in all aspects of national activities. Admiral Suetsugu, who once served as Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Fleet, is known by the Japanese as the builder of the modern Japanese fleet and is a prominent figure in the Japanese Navy.

Reuters, Tokyo, 16th Dispatch: Former Prime Minister Konoe, President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, stated in his opening address at the Central Cooperative Council of the Association today that the international situation surrounding Japan is becoming increasingly tense, and the European war is expanding without end. This situation is sufficient to plunge the entire world into great chaos at any moment. In order to safely navigate this critical era and to reassure the Emperor, everyone should stand in their respective positions and fulfill their respective responsibilities.

### Japanese Military and Political Leaders Hold Meeting

### Rumors of a Serious Issue Brewing Between the Soviet Union and Germany; Tokyo and Vichy Are Both Involved; Soviets Refuse to Conclude a Military Alliance with Germany

Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch: The diplomatic correspondent of the Observer stated that there is credible reason to believe that a more serious and far-reaching event than the mutual deployment of troops and preparedness is brewing between the Soviet Union and Germany. Tokyo and Vichy are both involved, with Tokyo being directly involved. Japan's motive is more anti-Soviet than pro-German. Moreover, Berlin may not know it, but Moscow is well aware of it. The Soviet Union is concerned that if the de facto Soviet-German military alliance is shown to Japan, Japan will not only be anti-Soviet but also anti-German, and may even seek a compromise with the United States. In view of this possibility, the Soviet Union has refused Berlin's request for a Soviet-German military alliance. Furthermore, Germany has resolved not to allow Japan to permanently possess the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator, which were formerly owned by Germany before the war and were entrusted to Japan by the League of Nations after the war. If a Soviet-German military alliance is established, the Soviet Union will support Germany's determination, which is also unacceptable to Japan. In Tokyo's view, the outbreak of war between the Soviet Union and Germany would be secretly welcomed, just as the Soviet Union views the war between Britain and Germany. However, if a Soviet-German alliance is established, Tokyo would truly be unable to avoid seeing it as a death knell for Japan's South Pacific ambitions. Therefore, Moscow's rejection of Berlin's diplomatic pressure is aided by Japan's activities in the Soviet Union. As for Vichy's indirect role in the current diplomatic situation, Vichy's recent note to London is, in effect, no different from the note issued by Germany. However, Vichy's attitude remains ambivalent, and the threat of Germany extracting French wealth from the European continent has now been greatly weakened, because France knows that within Germany's power, the punishment has been exhausted and there is nothing more to punish. Germany's pretense of not being involved in the Anglo-French dispute in Syria is a trick that deceives no one. The question now is whether Hitler can coerce Vichy to order the French Empire not to submit to General de Gaulle.

Germany Plans to Launch Attack After Autumn; Soviet Union Strengthens Military Power

United Press, Ankara, 16th Dispatch: Well-informed sources in neutral diplomatic circles here stated yesterday that a German attack on the Soviet Union is inevitable unless the Soviet Union agrees to help Germany with food to supply the Nazi-conquered areas of Europe. They also stated that military activities on both sides of the Soviet-German front are being actively carried out. Diplomats also said that Germany apparently believes it can destroy the Soviet army within six weeks, but hopes to launch the attack after the autumn harvest. It was also said that the German troops concentrated there are apparently ready to launch an offensive, unless the Soviet Union complies with all of Germany's demands for planting and supplies.

TASS, Moscow, 16th Dispatch: The Soviet News Agency published an important editorial today, stating that the current situation has prompted the Soviet Union to strengthen its military and economic power in all aspects, and claiming that the Soviet Union can remove obstacles and achieve victory whether in fighting the enemy or in other areas. The original text is as follows: "The Bolshevik Party encourages countless people to complete their tasks. Whether it is fighting the enemy, consolidating national strength and security, or developing the economy and culture, the Soviet Union can remove obstacles and achieve victory. The boldness of the Bolshevik thought, the fearless action, and the spirit of achieving the goal are the factors that eliminate all difficulties. In socialist countries, the development of science and technology has become a matter of national concern. Our country has many paths and opportunities to develop science and technology. Scientists and technicians have been awarded the highest award—the Stalin Prize—and their bold ideas are seen in new scientific inventions such as new aircraft, new types of artillery, and new agricultural machinery. In short, the opportunities for the future development of science and technology in our country are unlimited. Therefore, their responsibility to the people is great. The current international situation has prompted our motherland to strengthen its military and economic power and to move forward along the path of science and technology."

### Hitler Plans to Convene European Conference; Will Invite the Soviet Union, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey to Participate; German Foreign Minister Meets with Japanese Ambassador to Italy; British Ambassador and Turkish Foreign Minister Discuss Soviet Situation

Reuters, Istanbul, 16th Dispatch: According to German sources, Hitler intends to convene a European conference in the near future, imitating the British government's practice of convening a conference of Allied countries. Representatives from all signatory countries and occupied countries of the Tripartite Pact will attend. It is rumored that the Soviet Union will also participate, and Germany will also invite Sweden, Spain, and Turkey to participate, so that all European countries that are still outside Hitler's "New Order" will also be included. The purpose of the conference is to make social, political, and economic arrangements for the European "New Order."

Reuters, Istanbul, 16th Dispatch: British Ambassador Hugessen met with Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu for an hour yesterday. It is widely believed that the situation in the Soviet Union may have been among the issues discussed by the two.

Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch: The German official news agency stated that at the ceremony in Venice yesterday for Croatia to join the Tripartite Pact, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano welcomed the participating representatives, saying that this pact is not a temporary matter, but will become the permanent basis for general cooperation. Any country that shares the desire of Germany, Italy, and Japan to build a new world order and world security can join. The Axis powers recognize that the establishment of an independent Croatia is an act of justice to correct the injustices of the Treaty of Versailles.

Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch: A dispatch from Rome stated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had two long talks when they met to discuss Croatia's joining the Axis. Ribbentrop also met with Japanese Ambassador Horikiri.

British Newspapers Pay Attention to German-Soviet Situation

United Press, London, 16th Dispatch: British newspapers have recently published speculations about the rumored Soviet-German relationship in prominent positions. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both stated that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, may not return to the Soviet Union and may take a government position. According to the government, Cripps has been recalled to report on routine matters, while the Daily Mail stated that he would not return to the Soviet Union unless the Prime Minister actively requested it. It is heard that Cripps feels that his mission has not been accomplished, and therefore advocates that the government should send a new envoy. London newspapers believe that Stalin has yielded to Hitler's demands, but there is no confirmed news here that the German side has any demands. The newspapers' belief is largely based on the claim that the Soviet Union will not resist German aggression. The Daily Telegraph stated, "We can more or less imagine Stalin taking a certain approach to save face." The Times, on the other hand, repeatedly stated that Hitler may be employing a feint to the east while striking in the west. The newspaper stated, "The British government does not believe that Hitler is definitely planning to attack the Soviet Union." Among the various pieces of information obtained here, the above news seems to be the most important. Furthermore, the Daily Mail's Ankara correspondent stated that the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union presented a note to Stalin two weeks ago, requesting the Soviet Union to join the Tripartite Pact, allow German troops to pass through Soviet territory, and demanding that the Soviet Union reply by June 18. However, the Soviet Union's reply has reached Berlin and is also trying to delay its decision. The correspondent also stated that news about German troop movements in recent days is sufficient to indicate that the Germans are preparing to launch a large-scale attack on Britain, or to attack Ukraine, or to attack both places simultaneously around June 25. Newspapers here have also prominently published news from Ankara that Hitler is planning to convene a European conference, and news from travelers from Hungary and Romania that they expect German troops to invade the Soviet Union within two weeks.

Germany Claims Heavy Losses for British Ships

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th Dispatch: According to official sources, German submarines have continued to sink 29,000 tons of enemy ships. From June 1 to 14, the enemy's ship losses amounted to 300,000 tons. Since the beginning of the war, a total of 12 million tons have been lost, which is equal to the total amount lost during the First World War. It is reported that the ships that the United States can currently lease are all for American use. According to statistics from the American shipping industry, the ships that the United States can build in one year are only equal to two months of British ship losses. In 1917, British ship losses were 500,000 tons per month. In the first five months of this year, the average loss was 730,000 tons. According to an article published by Churchill in the London Sunday Pictorial on January 12, 1919, he admitted that the German submarine attacks almost brought England to its knees. The losses in this war are greater than in the previous war, so the situation in England can be known.

### Fierce Fighting off the Coast of Lebanon: British and Australian Forces Capture Sidon; Kiswe and Jezzine Also Fall; German Bomber Squadrons Defeated in Aerial Battles

United Press, Cairo, 16th – Official announcement was made yesterday that Allied forces have shattered the French defenses in the central sector of Syria. A squadron of German bombers was defeated in fierce aerial combat off the coast of Lebanon. At that time, the British Navy bombarded Sidon, and when the German squadron came to bomb, it was driven back by British aircraft. Because German aircraft participated in the battle, the British side admits that French resistance on most fronts has greatly intensified. It is reported that British and Australian forces and their tank columns have broken through Sidon's defense line and are fighting in the city's streets. The entire 18-mile-long Damour defense line has been breached. Kissine, 17 miles west of Sidon, has also been captured by British forces. This battle has opened the road to attack Beirut and Damascus. Furthermore, British aircraft attacked German airfields in the Rayak area near Beirut, destroying several aircraft, and also bombed the Aleppo airfield. Damascus is gradually being surrounded by Free French forces.

Reuters, London, 15th – A British Air Force communiqué from the Middle East stated that the British Air Force continues to assist the army fighting in Syria and the British warships assisting offshore. German bombers, escorted by fighters, approached British warships but were intercepted by British fighters, and several were damaged. Allied bombers also destroyed several enemy aircraft near Rayak and attacked enemy troops and motor transport in the Mirkiri district. The British Naval Air Arm launched torpedoes and hit an enemy ship near Beirut.

United Press, Vichy, 16th – After capturing Sidon, Australian troops have advanced to a certain stronghold 18 miles from Beirut, which is the Syrian naval and military base. It is reported that Beirut is constantly being bombed by the Royal Air Force, while Damascus has not been subjected to air raids.

Havas, Vichy, 15th – British fleets are currently shelling French positions along the coasts of Syria and Lebanon, with a total of nine warships.

Havas, Vichy, 15th – Military observers here stated that Australian Commonwealth forces have placed significant pressure on the city of Sidon. The French fiercely resisted for five days before reluctantly withdrawing on Thursday.

Reuters, London, 15th – According to Turkish radio, although many Beirut residents have gone to mountain resorts to escape the heat, the port is currently very peaceful. The Prime Minister of Syria issued a notice in Damascus, instructing residents to remain calm, stating that the current situation "provides no reason for panic," and that the authorities have taken all measures to protect their lives and property. French communiqués also state that naval and air forces jointly contained the British fleet with good results, and that there is no fighting in southern Syria.

British Forces Advance on Three Routes; Damascus Under Siege

United Press, London, 16th – Official announcement today stated that British forces are advancing on Syria via three routes and have surrounded Damascus. It was also stated that British forces are only 12 miles from Beirut and are using a pincer movement strategy to threaten the main Vichy forces retreating from Sasa, as the enemy forces are in danger of being cut off. Other Allied troops are still stationed in the suburbs of Damascus, awaiting negotiations for a peaceful entry into the city, while continuing to tighten the encirclement. A stronghold seven miles east of Kisford has been captured by British forces. The press predicts that Damascus will fall within 24 hours. Since the British forces began their offensive at 2:00 AM on June 8th, they have occupied 27,000 square miles of coastline and are advancing on Beirut and Damascus via five routes.

United Press, Vichy, 16th – French authorities yesterday ordered the evacuation of 9,500 residents of Beirut.

Reuters, London, 16th – Jerusalem news reports that 2,500 square miles of Syrian territory are now under British rule. Merchants are allowed to transport food into the occupied areas. Vichy forces have suffered few casualties.

Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th – A British military spokesman here has confirmed the gradual advance of British and Free French forces, stating that Kiswe and Jezzine have both been captured by Allied forces. The spokesman also stated that after capturing Kiswe southeast of Damascus, the Allied forces are now beginning military operations east of Kiswe, eight miles away at Atriyeh. The capture of Jezzine in the Lebanese mountains east of the ancient city of Sidon has allowed the troops in the area to run parallel with the column advancing along the coastal highway to Beirut. The spokesman denied that British forces from Iraq had occupied Tell es Chehab on the Euphrates River, 50 miles inside the Syrian border.

Reuters, London, 16th – Authorities here have announced that the Allied advance in Syria has reached a certain point. After the enemy forces withdrew from Kiswe, the city fell into Allied hands. Forces are now being divided into eastern and western routes in an attempt to encircle Damascus. Also, the northern bank of A'ajjeh is now controlled by Allied forces, and they are advancing towards Sasa in central Syria. This victory seems slow because they want to minimize the loss of life.

Reuters, London, 16th – It has been confirmed here that Allied forces have entered Sidon and Kiswe, 11 miles from Damascus.

European War Anecdotes (6) (3)

### Memories of the United States Entering the War in 1917

US President Roosevelt recently said in a "fireside chat": "The entire history of the United States is tied to the freedom of the seas. The US Navy has fought repeatedly to uphold this freedom." This important statement is similar to the situation before President Wilson declared war on Germany 24 years ago. It is worthwhile for us to revisit old events. The following is a translation of what was published in the American Journal of Diplomacy:

There are various opinions on why the United States entered the European War in 1917. But at least one person knew the truth, and that was President Wilson. The President, in deep water, maintained American neutrality for almost three years, but ultimately had to enter the vortex.

When discussing the reasons for the United States' participation in the last European War, it is necessary to start with President Wilson's personality. By virtue of his position as President, he often made decisions on foreign policy himself, and the more serious the international situation, the more important American foreign policy became. President Wilson never liked others overstepping their authority. He himself was his own foreign minister. After assessing the trends of public opinion, he made all major decisions independently. He delivered the "too proud to fight" speech and returned German Ambassador Bernstorff without any room for discussion. At the time, American sentiment was indeed biased towards the Entente Powers (Britain and France), and the prosperity of the American economy depended on maintaining trade with the Entente Powers. But to say that these facts are the reasons for the United States' entry into the war is a superficial understanding.

Wilson's personal feelings towards the belligerent nations, as demonstrated in all respects, could not avoid harboring a bias towards the Entente Powers, but he firmly believed that such feelings should not influence national policy. As a result, both sides of the belligerent nations accused him of favoring the other side and attacked him. But there is no doubt that he regarded maintaining American peace as his sole responsibility. He held this dual policy from August 1915, when the "Arabic" ship was sunk by a German submarine. He said, "The people of the whole country have charged me with keeping the United States out of the whirlpool of war. If we rashly participate in the war, the entire world situation will collapse, and all fair solutions will be despaired of." Even though Germany added significant insults, he would rather hold onto this policy without change. In September of the same year, he told his confidants, "The whole country is my shield, with nothing to fear. I must exercise extreme patience, but it takes a lot of thought to figure out to what extent patience is still a virtue."

But in addition to Wilson's determination to maintain American peace, he was even more determined to protect his country's neutral rights. He insisted that American honor should be above all else. In February 1916, he said, "I have tried hard to keep the country out of the whirlpool of war. But the people have entrusted me with one more important thing, which is to protect the honor of the United States and not let it be tarnished. This is not something I can do on my own, but depends on the actions of the belligerent nations. Therefore, American honor and peace are in danger of being impossible to maintain at any time. The people should not be harsh on this contradictory situation."

Wilson used an impartial attitude to defend American neutral rights, denouncing both sides of the belligerent nations. He believed that the British and French naval blockade policy violated international law and protested, stating that the United States did not recognize this semi-blockade status as legitimate. In the late summer of 1916, Congress granted the President broad powers, allowing him to prohibit loans and implement embargoes when necessary, as a means of retaliation. Several weeks later, he advocated strongly warning British Foreign Secretary Grey, saying: "The American people are increasingly anxious about the violation of neutral rights. The intensity of their anti-British sentiment is no less than it was at the beginning of anti-German sentiment."

The reason the President did not implement an embargo against Britain and France was that just when the issue of Britain and France obstructing neutral countries' trade was raging, Germany suddenly expanded its submarine destruction policy, diverting American attention. Colonel House said in his memoirs, "If Germany had not lost American sympathy due to tactical considerations, the United States would never have allowed Britain and France to control trade on the high seas." British Naval Minister Churchill also said that Germany's initial trial of submarine policy had given us great help. Our discord with the United States has since vanished, and people's hearts were greatly comforted for a time.

Wilson believed that the nature of Germany's infringement of American rights was different from that of Britain and France, and the methods of dealing with them were also different. If Germany's submarine policy was specifically aimed at the British and French naval blockade, it could have been tolerated, but this policy greatly harmed the rights of neutral countries. Due to tactical considerations in submarine warfare, merchant ships of belligerent or neutral countries, whether carrying contraband or not, could not be given warning and had to be suddenly sunk and then quickly escaped, making it inconvenient to rescue passengers and sailors on board. Wilson found that public opinion in the country was greatly shocked by this large-scale destruction by Germany. This was not a subtle issue of law. German submarines indiscriminately destroyed American lives and property, which was naturally very different from the blockade by Britain and France. Between January and March 1917, American ports had mountains of goods piled up, and all industries were declining, which was the result of the submarine threat.

If the submarine policy only threatened American material interests, Wilson would not have declared war on Germany. He never regarded purely material interests as a prerequisite for national policy. Although German-American relations were fraught with difficulties, the resolution of economic issues was not yet on the verge of collapse. However, Germany's submarine tactics, which disregarded the lives of American sailors and passengers, involved the issue of human rights. The boundary between material interests and human rights is clear. (To be continued)

### Germany Sinks Robin Moor, Intending to Force US into War; First Application of Axis Strategy to Deprive US of Adequate Preparation

United Press, Washington, 16th – A well-informed naval source here told United Press reporters yesterday that he believes the sinking of the "Robin Moor" by a German submarine is the first application of the Axis powers' military strategy, intended to drive US naval patrols away from the strategically critical North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and into the South Atlantic. This source, who declined to be named, pointed out that it is a well-known fact that the North Atlantic desperately needs patrols, and this patrol force is already operating in a wide area. If the US patrol force here is dispersed, German submarine raiders and long-range aircraft will find it easier to succeed in their anti-British operations in the Atlantic.

Reuters, New York, 16th – Several newspapers are calling for retaliatory measures for the sinking of the American ship Robin Moor by a German submarine. The Milwaukee Journal said that since the high seas are threatened by Nazi warships' piracy, the United States has every reason to sink any German ship it sees, whether on the surface or submerged, and rid the Atlantic of German ships. The Boston Globe also called the sinking of the American ship by a German submarine piracy and considered clearing the pirates the appropriate response. A recent Gallup poll showed that 55 percent of voters favored naval escorts for ships carrying military supplies to Britain, while 29 percent were opposed, and the rest were undecided. Regarding aid to Britain, 55 percent supported President Roosevelt's stance, 33 percent thought the President was going too far, and the rest thought the President was not doing enough.

Havas, Washington, 15th – Political figures here generally believe that President Roosevelt's claim in his fireside chat that the principle of freedom of the seas is one of the foundations of American foreign policy means that the sinking of the American cargo ship "Robin Moor" by a German submarine has endangered this principle. Deputy Secretary of State Welles told reporters the other day that the cargo ship was sunk far from the war zone. As for the German Foreign Ministry's statement that any ship carrying arms and ammunition to Britain should be sunk, Welles called it "outrageous and unreasonable." This is the general view of the American government. In Germany, it seems that they would rather have the United States enter the war now, when American preparations are not complete, than let the United States choose the time to fight. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's recent speech, in which he said that even if the United States "openly declares war on the Axis powers, there is nothing to fear," shows that this view is not without merit. Well-informed sources believe that the United States can only demand a formal apology and compensation from Germany, and a guarantee that the same thing will not happen again in the future. If this request is rejected, the prestige of the United States will be greatly damaged. Therefore, if Germany refuses the above request, the United States will sever diplomatic relations with Germany. President Roosevelt's decision to freeze Axis funds in the United States is probably a warning to the German government.

### Yarnell Urges Full Aid to China

United Press, New York, 16th – Former US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell said last night at the 39th annual meeting of the Yale University Chinese Students Association that if the United States wants future peace, China must be a free and stable country. Yarnell advocated providing China with a huge amount of material aid and said that the idea of American isolationists is "a fool's dream." Yarnell also said that if the United States does not want to see democracy, freedom, and human rights disappear from the earth, the Sino-Japanese War may soon become the United States' war. Yarnell praised Chinese relief donations and considered them the most economical way to maintain Chinese morale.

### Brazil Borrows from US to Build Air Force Base; Discussions in Rio de Janeiro; Other American Nations Will Hold Similar Talks

United Press, Washington, 16th – Brazilian Army Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Rimmick announced yesterday that negotiations are underway for Brazil to borrow 100 million from US credit to build an air force base on the Brazilian coast opposite Dakar. The State Department declined to comment on this official announcement. Lieutenant Colonel Rimmick also said that the loan negotiations are being held in Rio de Janeiro and that sovereignty over the air force base will belong to the Brazilian government, but the United States will be allowed to use it in times of emergency. Part of the loan will be used to purchase arms and ammunition for the Brazilian army from the United States. Some observers believe that these negotiations demonstrate Brazil and the Western Hemisphere countries' determination to genuinely cooperate in resisting foreign aggression. They also pointed out that although Germany had used large quantities of arms to exchange for Brazilian coffee, Brazil has now decided to obtain arms assistance from the United States. At the same time, it was stated that other Latin American countries will also conduct similar negotiations. Political circles say that credit loans may be extended to Chile.

It is hoped that the Bureau will immediately find ways to facilitate the full utilization of domestic manpower.

### Democracy Victory Conference Held in the US

The meeting has appointed an organizing committee of 15 members from China, Britain, Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Norway to coordinate anti-Nazi propaganda around the world. According to Torellivet, the Vichy government only has the support of 5 to 10 percent of French people, and he explained the current situation in France, saying that opposition to Nazi sabotage is increasing daily. Bombings of armories, blocked traffic, destroyed railway vehicles, and bombed airports have occurred in Lille, Lyons, and Marseille. Torellivet reiterated the need to conduct anti-propaganda in France, because Vichy is trying to use Italy's position in the Axis to lure the people, and said that if Britain wins, France will only be another British dominion.

### China Youth Association Held College Guidance Lecture Yesterday. Gu Zhuoren Spoke on "Entering University"

The college guidance lecture hosted by the Lifelong Department of the Chinese YMCA began yesterday at 4 p.m. in the assembly hall of the Ba Xian Qiao branch. Mr. Gu Zhuoren, Director of Guidance at Zhijiang University, spoke on "Entering University," summarizing as follows:

Considering Human Nature

You are one in a thousand in Chinese society. After entering university in the next term, you will be one in ten thousand. The opportunity is rare and can be imagined. In this great era of resistance and nation-building, it is not easy to enter university. Therefore, if the issue of your further education is not handled carefully, it would be a great pity. Consequently, college guidance is increasingly needed. This type of guidance is very common in countries like England and the United States, but it is extremely rare in Chinese society. Often, those who are capable of pursuing further education only consider social trends and neglect their own personalities, resulting in their studies failing to reach their full potential. For example, today China urgently needs specialized technical personnel, and many students respond to this need by flocking to engineering courses, etc. However, often because their personalities are not suitable, the results of their forced studies are very limited. As a result, first-class talent is very rare. Therefore, before pursuing further education, you should first analyze yourselves, review your own personalities, and discuss which field of skills you are suited for.

Three Examples

For example, common occupations can be divided into three categories: (1) relationships with people, (2) relationships with things, and (3) relationships with imagination. If you aspire to succeed as a famous doctor in the medical field, then the primary question is whether you are deeply interested in people. Otherwise, you will be unable to deal with countless patients. The same applies to those who want to become lawyers; they must be good at socializing. If you prefer to stay at home, no one will pay attention to you. Regarding the second point, if you study agriculture or chemistry, you must be deeply interested in things. Regarding the third point, if you want to become a famous literary writer, you must possess sufficient imagination. The above describes the relationship between a person's personality and their choice of study, but there is no absolute distinction, only a comparison in degree.

Second Understanding

As for those who are interested in all three points mentioned above, then their interests are very broad, and they are suitable to be journalists, that is, they have the talent of a leader. After understanding yourself, you must also understand what a university is. As the saying goes, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." Regarding this point: (1) University is a stage of learning, not the end. Learning has no limit. During this stage, you will be told the methods of reading and the rules of research. There will be less time for teacher guidance and more time for self-study, which is clearly different from middle school. These four years are a necessary stage. (2) Some say that calling university students "Hanlin" or "Tu Daifu" (old terms for scholars) seems very outdated. It is better to call them "Junzi" (gentlemen) because during the university period, personality and knowledge are both trained. Therefore, the university trains you to become a complete person. (3) The courses you take during university may have some distance from the work you obtain after graduation. For example, those who study railway engineering may serve on highways after graduation, which is also acceptable. Generally, people believe that the courses you take in university determine your future fixed job, which is actually a mistake. (4) The courses offered in universities are generally universal. Do not think that since you have a specialization, you do not need to take other required courses. You must know that many departments of knowledge have inseparable connections.

Physical Training

Finally, if you want to enter university, you should first pay attention to physical training. Otherwise, what is the use of receiving a university diploma and then taking it into your coffin? Wouldn't it be a waste of precious money? In addition, you should also pay attention to the entrance examination and the choice of school. The former should not be taken too seriously. As long as you are truly studying during middle school, there is no problem in entering university. For caution, you should take the examination for at most two universities at the same time. There is no need to take the examination for four universities; it is a waste of energy, time, and registration fees. One or two days before the exam, it is best not to read books and conserve energy for full effort. Some people cram at the last minute and burn the midnight oil before the exam, which is harmful and not beneficial.

Examination Techniques

Also, during the exam, answer as many questions as possible to get more points because schools only use comparative standards to admit new students, not absolute standards. Regarding the choice of university, there are two points: (1) there are many courses; (2) professors must have solid knowledge. Regarding the subjects of the university entrance examination, for the liberal arts and business schools approved by the National Government's Ministry of Education, the liberal arts subjects are Civics, Chinese, English, Mathematics (Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigonometry), Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, Biology. The science and engineering subjects are Civics, Chinese, English, Mathematics (Higher Algebra, Analytic Geometry, Trigonometry), Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, Physics and Chemistry.

Today's Program

As for today's program, it has been set.

### New Huan No. 2 Elementary School Announces Early Vacation. Teachers Unwilling to Hold Examinations

(Da Hua News Agency) The privately-run New Huan No. 2 Elementary School on Chongqing Road in this city previously had a work slowdown due to teachers requesting improved treatment and early issuance of employment contracts. Fortunately, after proper mediation by educational authorities, the improvement in treatment was resolved first, and classes were quickly resumed. However, regarding the issue of the timing of the issuance of employment contracts, the school insisted that they would only be issued after the vacation, and the two sides' opinions never came close to agreement. Although educational authorities repeatedly sent personnel for mediation and proposed a compromise solution, advising the school to issue the employment contracts on the day the examinations began, when the term examinations began yesterday, and the relevant authorities were sending personnel to have a final talk with the principal of the school, the teachers, believing that their jobs were not guaranteed, were unwilling to hold the term examinations and were willing to continue teaching as usual. However, the school authorities, citing academic regulations, did not allow for any changes, so they sent some students from the third grade of the business department of the middle school to administer the examinations, resulting in a serious conflict and leading to injuries from fighting between middle and elementary school students. The school authorities then announced to the parents in the afternoon that they would declare an early vacation. The teachers also issued a declaration stating their grievances. However, according to the principal, the teachers who were unwilling to hold the term examinations were only a part of the teachers, not all of them. The middle school students who were sent were to protect the teachers who were willing to administer the examinations, he said.

### How to Study English (5)

— Ye Jinfeng

Words should be selected carefully; it's not about having many. Shakespeare only used 15,000 words. Next is Thackeray, with only eight or nine thousand. Stevenson only used six or seven thousand. Most people only need around three thousand good words, which is enough. But you need to know the accurate usage. Just knowing the word is not enough. By "carefully selected," I mean: (1) read articles by standard writers; (2) use your discerning eye to select them. You can collect two or three, at most four or five words a day, which is already remarkable.

As for grammar and rhetoric, it's best not to read them rigidly. When you feel the need, just refer to them.

You don't have to memorize when reading, but when you come across a very good sentence, you can write it down in a small notebook you carry with you. When you come across a very good paragraph, you can also copy it down, prepare to observe it often, but don't do too much, as it's easy to get tired of it.

Writing

1. Structure: If you know how to read, you should know how to write. The old-fashioned composition formula is the "beginning, development, turn, and conclusion" four-character formula. Modern composition is "introduction, 1, 2, 3, conclusion," which is not very different from the old-fashioned one. The "introduction" is the preface, 1, 2, and 3 are the points, and the "conclusion" is the conclusion. Short compositions can cut off the beginning and end. The most important thing is still the solid points. It's best to avoid irrelevant nonsense. For the method of structure, please refer to the first point in the previous article, "How to Read," and it will become clear.

2. Practice: The best way to practice composition is to write and revise on your own. Franklin succeeded by doing just that. His method was to take a good article from others, take down the main points, and after two days, develop it into an article according to these main points, and then compare it with the original article. When comparing, you need to be calm and focused. Why is mine not good? What is good about theirs? Once you understand what is good about theirs, you have to take it into your own hands. We can translate a small section of a good article, and after a day or two, translate it back, compare it with the original sentence by sentence, and carefully ponder it. When practicing at first, it doesn't matter if even a sentence is wrong, "as long as you are willing to put your heart into it, a pestle can be ground into a needle."

### Finance: After the U.S. Freezes German and Italian Funds, Speculation Rises and Foreign Exchange is Dumped

The foreign exchange market yesterday: HSBC listed all exchange rates as flat. The dark market for British and American exchange rates first loosened and then slightly rebounded. News reported that the U.S. President approved the freezing of German and Italian funds. Speculators came in droves to dump, and the U.S. dollar for next month fell to $5.4375 in the chaos but then hardened to being convertible. Hua Bank slightly absorbed, and foreign banks also absorbed at the higher price. Importers were heard to be settling payments, and the trend turned soft. British gold at 3 3/8s 34375 was also difficult to convert. In the afternoon, speculators dumped even more (a total of 500,000 US dollars were sold throughout the day), causing the July rate to harden to $5.4375, up .0625, and the near-term rate to $5.40625, up .03125. British gold at 3 3/8s 328125 was up .015625. Trading was extremely active throughout the day.

Gradually Relaxing Amid Chaos

Since the British and American silver markets had no activity in morning news, Indian silver slightly rose. It was heard that British and American exchange rates were flat. The bank's early morning selling price for spot British exchange was 3 3/8s 3125, and the U.S. dollar was $5.375. Before long, speculators found it difficult to get rid of the $5.40625 for this month and sold to the Mainland and Zhejiang-Xing $5.4375 for July. The softest rates were difficult to sell for conversion. HSBC listed all exchange rates without change. After the silver balance tax was still levied at 23.75%, foreign banks slightly absorbed, and the speculative selling momentum weakened. The market stabilized and turned slightly soft. The afternoon close for British gold was 3 3/8s 328125, and the U.S. dollar was $5.40625.

$500,000 US Dollars Sold Throughout the Day

In the afternoon, Chinese merchants speculated and dumped even more fiercely, selling another $5.4375 U.S. dollars for July. A total of $500,000 US dollars were sold throughout the day. The appetite of foreign banks to absorb waned again, and it became difficult to sell at the higher price. Until the 3:30 p.m. close, the spot to July British exchange rate was 3 3/8s 328125, the spot and June U.S. dollar was 5 兀 40625, and the July rate was 5 兀 4375. Compared to the Saturday afternoon close, British gold was up .015625, and the spot and current month U.S. dollar was up .03125, and July was up .0625.

Hong Kong and Shanghai Exchange Rates Drop Uniquely

Hong Kong, 16th (Tuesday): The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot dropped 2 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen to 450 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.

Tianjin Exchange Market: British Flat, American Tight

Tianjin, 16th (Tuesday): The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate was unchanged, still standing at 3 便土 4375. The New York telegraphic transfer rate tightened 0625 to 5 yuan and 5625. The Shanghai exchange rate rose 2 yuan to 97 yuan. The "Joint Note" unofficial rate rose 1 yuan to 57 yuan and 5 jiao.

### Foreign Currencies Still Stable

Yesterday's foreign currency market: fell, but cash tended to rise, so British and American gold pounds were still stable. British gold notes remained stable as before, and the market price stood flat. U.S. dollar notes rose to 4 jiao and a half at the opening, but soon fell back and closed at 18 yuan and 1 jiao and 9 fen, down 1 fen from last week. Hong Kong notes tended to weaken, and the market price softened. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes did not rise or fall. The former still stood at the original price of 1 yuan and 9 jiao and 3 fen, and the latter was still 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 3 fen.

### Gold Prices Plunge in a Fierce Selling Wave

Yesterday's gold market saw a continued sharp decline in the unofficial rate, with the price breaking the 6,400 yuan mark. This was due to the fatigue from the weekend, and the U.S. President ordered the freezing of German and Italian funds in the U.S. The U.S. dollar for July at 5 yuan and 4375 had supply but no demand. Gold prices, in a consistent and fierce selling wave, saw a low price of 6,355 yuan. Because the drop had exceeded the looseness of foreign exchange, the settlement price was huge. Exchange houses Xinfeng and Yongdu came in to arbitrage 6-7,000 taels, and foreign exchange stopped loosening and slightly rebounded. The price then climbed up to 6,398 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was heard that Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., had safely arrived in Chongqing and would take office as Foreign Minister, which excited people. Moreover, distant-month U.S. dollars became cheaper again, and Dafeng Yiyuan re-emerged, and the price was heavily suppressed, finally closing down a small 45 兀. Transactions for the whole day were 6-70,000 taels. The swap (June transferred to July) was posted by the seller Yifeng to Mingfeng for 50,000 taels, and to Yida for 450 taels, both at 50 yuan, and again at 8 yuan. Cash, on the other hand, rose. Yongfengyu put out 50 taels at a time and 50 taels at a time, and Yongfengyu put out 20 taels, and Yili put out 30 taels, all bought by Chengji, and the price was also 250 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Xianghe took in 20 taels from Tianyuan, 350 yuan higher, and the price increased by 15 yuan. Ornaments were flat.

Futures Dropped 45 Yuan

Since morning, the July rate per bar (ten taels) fell below 6,400 yuan due to news favoring sellers, and people were uneasy. The opening price at 9:15 a.m. was 6,380 yuan, 36 yuan lower. Under the selling pressure of Xinfeng Yongyu Xingyong and various accounts, from 6,385 yuan, it plunged sharply, and floating accounts followed suit and replenished. Foreign exchange stopped loosening and slightly rebounded, and the price then climbed to around 6,380 yuan. Near noon, Xinfeng and Yongyi repeatedly arbitraged in 6-7,000 taels, and Dafeng, Shunyuan, and Chengji all bought, rising to 6,398 yuan. The noon close was 6,393 yuan. The opening at 2 p.m. was 6,390 yuan, 3 yuan lower. It continued to fall to 6,385 yuan. Hengji and Xinfeng Yongli entered, rising to 6,395 yuan. Suddenly, Dafeng, Yifeng, Deda, and Chida came to sell, and the next-month U.S. dollar was difficult to sell at 5 yuan and 4375. The price then gradually fell to 6,368 yuan. Tongkang Yong and Xinfeng Yongli entered, rising to 6,372 yuan. The close at 3:30 p.m. was 6,371 yuan, down a small 45 yuan from the Saturday afternoon close. Calculated according to the July U.S. dollar at 5 64375, the settlement price was 6,404 yuan and 6 jiao, a difference of 33 yuan and 6 jiao. There was a difference of 43 yuan for the whole day. The selling price of wooden-labeled gold for cash accounts was 360 yuan higher than the heat-red futures price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current standard gold.

Ornamental Gold Has Not Yet Hung Small

The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at silverware shops, Datongxing and Xintongxing, was still listed at 695 yuan, and the buying price was 40 yuan less, it was said.

### Yarn and Flowers: Shuangma Factory Tight for a Single Day, Yarn Prices Rise Formidably, Highest Price at 1,516 Yuan, Already Running Counter to Gold Prices

Yesterday, the yarn market, which had been hovering for several days, resumed its upward trend, and the rise was particularly intense. This was because the Guangzhou merchants continued to demand Shuangma yarn unabated, causing Shuangma factory singles to be tighter. Shorts were posting 5-7.5 jiao for day swaps, which made the longs more stable and could reduce the profit margin by half. As for the shorts, seeing this situation, they posted the profit margin every day, from 2.5 to 7.5 yuan per ten packages. Since Guangzhou business continued without interruption, they were of divided mind, and so they painfully compensated, and with the wind tightening, the market price went straight up. The final closing price was 1,511 yuan, but generally, the well-capitalized short positions, due to weak labeling and small offsetting, were still struggling. The highest price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,511 yuan, and the low price was 1,465 yuan. At the afternoon opening, the price surged to 1,516 yuan, and then, with profits being released, the securities brokers joined in selling, falling back to 1,492 yuan, and the final price was 1,496 yuan. Someone wanted to enter, it was said. Today, there are 145 pieces of cotton yarn bound for Hong Kong.

Shuangma opened in the morning. Because reports said that the Japanese army was expanding the silver line in the South China Sea and freezing the funds of European countries that had fallen into enemy hands, people were calm. The opening price was 1,465 yuan, and with floating accounts selling and shorts pressing down, it fell to 1,465 yuan. Unexpectedly, in an instant, many said that Guangzhou merchants were still trading Shuangma, and the market was buying strongly, and the market suddenly rose, surging to 1,495 yuan. By the time of the close, there were many rumors, all of which were bullish, and the price surged again to close at 1,511 yuan. The transaction statistics for half a day totaled 10,720 packages, of which the Hong Kong merchants took in 1,720 packages, and the domestic merchants took 9,000 packages.

The market for Jin Shuangma standard yarn rose gradually from the opening. The market continued to rise at the afternoon opening, but the closing fell back slightly. As a result, the July rate rose 7 yuan, and the August rate rose 3 yuan. The total transaction statistics for the day were 8,600 packages, which was less than the spot. This was because speculators had not yet concentrated huge amounts of capital and were not easy to coordinate. Generally, they were willing to issue profit margins for both longs and shorts and drill into the spot market.

### Cotton Market Increasingly Promising

The current cotton situation continues to be good, and fine绒原料 (fine fleece raw material) is especially tight. This is because foreign cotton is gradually rising. As for the factories, because yarn sales are active, their interest in raw materials is gradually increasing.

### Piece Goods, Yarn Prices Surge, Factory Cloth Increases Consistently

Factory cloth prices trended upward yesterday, due to increased interest from local streets, Hong Kong merchants, and Southeast Asian merchants.  The prices of both foreign cotton and yarn have risen, influencing sentiment.  Traders and hoarders have also been absorbing stock, so sales prices for all cloths have risen across the board.  White goods and fine cloth twills increased (per piece) by 2.5 to 5 角.  Bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 5 角. Local street transactions totaled over 600 pieces of various cloths. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian merchants transacted over 400 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and twills. Northern route, Qingdao merchants transacted 40-50 pieces of pigment serge, melton, and other goods. Today, there are 700 pieces of piece goods arriving from Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill increased (per piece) by 4-5 角. The range of fluctuations for twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth warehouse receipts was very narrow.

### Grains: Another 50,000 Bags Arrive Today, Foreign Rice Continues to Fall, Ningbo Merchants Purchase, Broken Rice Stands Alone

工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) foreign rice continues to arrive. The Taikoo Company's Ninghai vessel arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 10,000 bags of 工部局 foreign rice from Hong Kong. The vessel berthed at Yuedong Wharf yesterday and is scheduled to move to the wharf of the company on the Bund in the French Concession this morning for unloading. A certain American vessel managed by Wah Lun Foreign Firm, carrying a large quantity of foreign rice directly from Yangon to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to arrive the day before yesterday but did not arrive. Yesterday, the company stated that it was rescheduled to arrive today, with an estimated 40,000 bags of foreign rice, scheduled to berth at the Lumao Wharf in Pudong for unloading.

The market for foreign rice mostly continued to decline yesterday, but the market for broken rice, handled by Ningbo merchants, was weak but rebounded. The result was similar to the previous close. Saigon 小纹 (small pattern) rice initially fell and then stabilized, but the final price was still about $1 lower than Saturday's closing price.  The reason is that when the market opened in the morning, there were more arrivals than expected, and public sales of rice continued to be ordered and allocated. Customer hoarders were anxious, and the market atmosphere was extremely heavy with selling. High-grade rice fell across the board, falling by 元外 to about $2. Afterwards, Ningbo merchants took advantage of the small price to absorb stock, focusing on broken rice. A large quantity of both spot goods and original Ying Wah Company bags were taken in. It is said that the Ningbo group has already handled 15,000-16,000 bags, including the original bags. The market gradually rebounded. However, other rice prices were weak due to the lack of both local and outside customers. Broken rice from Ying Wah Company initially opened at $107, then ranged from $107.20 to $108. Small 絞 (small twist) also rose from $127 to $128.50. 路貨 (road goods) $136. No. 1 Saigon opened at $136 in the early market, and later the goods rebounded sharply, with calls as high as $1-2, but no agreement was reached. The total transaction volume for Ying Wah Company was 1,300-1,400 tons, and 15,000 bags of spot rice.

Thick and thin粳 (Japonica) domestic rice, southern port early and late rice, from the middle of the day off, the source of supply is visibly more, and wood village stores, due to weather relations, is dull, the market immediately presents oversupply, still weak, made open various prices see a decline of about $2.50. Fresh early and late rice sold for $121 and $130, old rice $116-117, old original bag $117. On the thick粳 market, there are only some Wuxi original bag old粳. Since goods are scarce, prices are neither cheap nor low, so the owners are reluctant to sell, and prices are unlikely to change, remaining stable. Subsequent openings were $101 and $120.

Glutinous rice, rice noodle and cake stores and other retail appetite, although still not smooth, but because the previous market transport was low, owners defended prices, market goods are scarce, the market continues to be flat, there is no rise or fall. Subsequent openings were Hong Kong high round grain $144-145, long grain $112-113, followed by $110, tender tea special $106-107, medium resolute $103-104, domestic 元 high from $120, resolute to $116.

### Flour Hoarders Eager to Try

The洋粉 (foreign flour) market, initially flat, then tight. The morning opening was not smooth due to local customer digestion, and the rice market did not escape its sideways pattern, making it difficult to excite people. Hoarders were cautious, and prices for all goods were stable. However, the after-market suddenly tightened because the source of new wheat still had many problems, and with the rising prices of oil beans and corn, local customer hoarders became active again. Golden Dragon flour initially opened at $29.30 to $29.35, and later rose to $29.50 to $29.70. Fort powder also rose from $30.02-30.03 to $30.80. There was also Fortune God flour at $29.20, Flying Scissors brand at $28.80. A total of more than 20,000 bags were traded. The market has entered a gradual rise.

The source of new wheat is still quiet. Chinese merchants have been banned and have no purchases. Only Japanese 鑫 factory continues to throw in, cooperating with grain merchants, selling at around $40. Therefore, the listing of new wheat this year is entirely controlled by someone.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Cake Market Coming to an End, Market Conditions Declining Rapidly

Yesterday's bean cake market only had June lower period futures calling on the market. Other expired items were out of the market. Spot cake transactions were quiet. A total of 300 pieces of Fei Zi cake opened, priced at $17.10. As a result, the futures market atmosphere was in a slump, and the rumor that the traditional system of soybeans being moved out can be used to collect taxes in kind dealt a fatal blow to the bulls. Therefore, market conditions seem to be declining rapidly, falling $0.40-$0.50 compared to last weekend. A total of Sheng Ji's June upper warehouse receipts and June lower delivery contracts were traded for 10,000 pieces, opening at $18.85 to $18.70, once recovering to $18.80, then falling again to close at $18.65. Local sales of soybean oil and peanut oil were slightly connected, and market conditions continued to rise by about $1-$2 due to sellers' efforts to push up prices. 90 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded.

### Securities: Bond Market Fluctuates, Industrial Stocks Continue to Rise

The over-the-counter public bond market had a slight fluctuation yesterday. The shorts repeatedly exerted pressure, but the market did not decline. Observing that the 41st issue, Ji Ji, Zhongfu Bank, and Xinfu were constantly absorbing on dips, it is feared that the market will not easily fall back. The news front is very good. The United States plans to provide China with US$1 billion in arms aid, and with considerable cash, to help China maintain foreign exchange. People across the country were excited, and the future gradually showed a glimmer of hope. Yesterday morning, the 41st issue, Xinfu, Lianyi, and Hengfu bought in, with the 41st issue being the most. Yuxing, Runli, Xin, Yichang sold out, with Yuxing being the most. The market was relatively weak. In the afternoon, the 41st issue and Xinfu, Lianyi continued to buy in.

Then the over-the-counter market price, British brand $1,440, Old Knife brand $1,010, Five China brand $730, Little Fairy brand $705. Because people's interest is still high, the flour market is searching, so spot goods in the market suddenly feel scarce, and the buying price may rise again.

### Silk and Tea: New Black Tea Shipped to Shanghai in Large Quantities

Now, in the tea-producing areas of Zhejiang Province, the sales of洋莊 (foreign firm) green tea have plummeted, and most of them have been converted to black tea. In addition, due to various transportation obstacles, the arrival of goods is scarce. It is understood that recently, Japanese merchants have transported more than 12,000 piculs of new black tea from 口 Hangzhou and Tangqi to prepare for export. However, the 洋莊 market has been very sluggish, with almost no one asking about green tea. Black tea is also only purchased by Chengheng, with 140 boxes purchased at a price of $380. There is no hope of improvement in exports.

### China's Bitter Struggle in the Far East is Actually Fighting for the United States; There Has Been a Great Change in the Mood of the American Public and Government, Believing That Strenuous Aid to China is the Only Way to Save Themselves

Special communication from Erjinshan (San Francisco): American expatriates in the Far East who have lived in or are native to China, who have recently evacuated back to the United States, one of the most visible things they have seen is that American public opinion regarding the Far East, especially regarding Japan, has undergone drastic changes. Today's Americans know much more about Far Eastern events than before, and show greater concern. Therefore, they do not hesitate to use very strong terms to condemn Japan's actions in China and in the South, and its relationship with the Axis powers.

Understanding the Significance of China's War

According to some of these American expatriates who have returned, two years ago, the American people recognized Japan's invasion of China as a rather regrettable misfortune, but thought that Japan's aggression and local incidents had no impact on the United States, so they only expressed sympathy for China, and did not understand the nature of China's war. Now that they have evacuated from the East and arrived in the United States, they are shocked to see that the United States has such a firm mood towards the Sino-Japanese incident.

American Interests Feel Threatened

There are several points to describe regarding the attitude of today's Americans: (1) The fate of the United States is actually tied to the Pacific Ocean. Anyone who disrupts the labor situation in the Pacific Ocean directly threatens American interests. (2) It can now be confirmed that Japan is a threat to peace and prosperity in the Pacific region. In other words, the United States can no longer trust Japan's friendship. (3) China is actually fighting for the United States in the East, just as Britain is fighting for the United States in the West. Therefore, the United States should provide not only food, trucks, and medical supplies to the extent possible, but also aircraft, artillery, munitions, and tanks.

Armaments and Money Flow Steadily

The evacuating American expatriates also mentioned the remarks made by President Roosevelt and Mr. Wilkie, as well as many politicians, businessmen, and educators, which stated that the United States must provide credit loans and arms to China, and make China a "arsenal of democracies" fighting against aggression. It is said that this is not only a temporary policy, but will directly lead to greater concern and activity from the American public and government in the East and the Pacific. Peace and stability in the Pacific this year and in the future will certainly be of great concern to the United States. This concrete mood has great significance for the future cooperation between China and the United States.

The People Demand a Complete Embargo

A few years ago, those who said that the United States and Japan might go to war were denounced as warmongers. Today, the American people are seriously discussing whether a US-Japan war is inevitable. Therefore, the demand for an embargo on Japan from all parties has increased unabated. Many American goods are already similar to an embargo, and their purpose is undoubtedly to deal with Japan. But American public opinion already has a demand for a complete embargo. This kind of mood can be seen everywhere. For example, when newsreels show Japanese officers in Vietnam or Japanese planes bombing Chongqing, the audience all lets out contemptuous hissing sounds.

Establishing International Friendship and Cooperation

Stanford University President Wilbur said that in the Pacific region, there will be a final conference in which mankind will end strife and aggression and create a new era of international friendship and cooperation. The universities on the shores of the Pacific Ocean are producing talents, and it is hoped that they can gain new understanding and perspectives.

### Fundraising for the Memorial Fund for the Deceased General Zhu

After General Zhu Qinglan passed away in Shaanxi, his coffin was placed in Daxingshan Temple in Xi'an. It is now reported that the various circles in Shaanxi Province have decided to hold a funeral on the 20th of this month and temporarily bury it in Zhuyuan Village in the southern suburbs of Xi'an. A national funeral ceremony will be held in the future. As for the memorial fund previously initiated by various circles, it will be used as the funding for the Fufeng Disaster Children's Education Institute. On the Shanghai side, Zhu Zigan from the Charity Association of Renji Hall is in charge of collecting donations.

### Seven President-Class Liners Requisitioned; Officially Announced Yesterday Morning; Each Ship Will Be Handed Over Upon Completion of Its Voyage; Twelve Other Liners Transferred to Take Over Various Shipping Lanes

Since the expansion of the European War, the United States has decided to help democratic countries resist aggression. The material assistance provided to China and Britain in the past has been put into practice. Recently, the United States will implement escorting ships, so the situation against the German and Italian Axis powers is deteriorating. The US government is using commercial ships to help Britain transport goods, and the Maritime Commission is gradually putting it into practice.

Requisition of Seven Liners Officially Announced

According to the Shanghai branch of the American President Lines yesterday, they officially announced that they received a telegram from the San Francisco head office yesterday morning, stating that seven mail ships currently operating on the Far East-Pacific shipping lanes, including the President Taft, President Cleveland, President Coolidge, President Pierce, and the new World-Class liners President Jackson, President Hayes, and President Adams, have been requisitioned.

No Stops on Return Voyages to Japanese Ports

The President Coolidge, which is currently on its voyage, is currently returning from Little Luzon (Philippines). It will arrive in Shanghai this Thursday and return to the United States the next day. It will not stop at Kobe or Yokohama, Japan, and will sail directly to Honolulu and then to San Francisco for handover to the government. The President Pierce departed from San Francisco at the beginning of this month and is expected to arrive in port this Saturday. The President Taft has also come from San Francisco to the east the day before yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai on the first of next month. It is not yet decided whether the two ships will return to the United States immediately after arriving in Shanghai or will still follow the original voyage to Hong Kong and Little Luzon.

World-Class Liners Handed Over on Return Voyage

As for the World-Class liners that are currently on their voyages, the President Jackson is scheduled to pass through Shanghai on the 10th of this month and go to various ports in Southeast Asia, pass through Mumbai, turn around the Cape of Good Hope, and return to the United States at the end of next month. Each ship will complete a determined voyage and be handed over to the Maritime Commission upon returning to the United States. After the company's seven liners were requisitioned, a solution was agreed upon for shipping affairs. It was also officially announced yesterday.

Twelve Liners Transferred to Take Over Shipping Affairs

Twelve other ships, including the President Taylor, President Madison, President Grant, President Harrison, President Monroe, President Garfield, President Van Buren, President Polk, President Buchanan, President Johnson, President Tyler, and President Fillmore, will be transferred to take over shipping affairs. Four of them have come to this city before. Among the remaining eight ships, there are both new and old ships. It is heard that several other cargo ships will also participate. However, the schedule of each ship has not yet been arranged. In the future, Sino-US shipping will not be affected.

### Wang Qingmu Critically Ill

Elderly Wang Qingmu of Su, who has been in charge of water conservancy projects in the Lake and Huai regions and is rich in writings, and whose political achievements cover the north and south, is of advanced age and has always been in good health. Last year, he suffered from cancer on his face, but recently, it has suddenly worsened and he is in critical condition.

### Britain Actively Aids China to Promote Cooperation Between the Two Countries; Expanding Publicity for Aid to China is Responded to by the Government and the Public; Fundraising to Commemorate China's War of Resistance; Secretary Woodman of the British Aid to China Fund Sends a Letter Reporting on His Work

Secretary Lockhart Woodman of the British Aid to China Fund recently sent a letter to a certain national salvation organization in China, describing the bombing situation in Britain and confirming the strength of British public opinion, and reporting on the work of the Fund to aid China. The Fund is the largest aid to China organization in the UK. Members are distributed throughout the country, and people from the government and the public participate. Therefore, favorable Chinese opinion is often created due to the work of the Fund. In addition to strengthening their own connections, members of the Fund often form groups of three or five to carry out external publicity, and their contact with parliamentarians and diplomats has been very successful. As a result, the formulation of British national policy is also somewhat influenced by this aid to China atmosphere.

Preparing a Commemoration of China's War of Resistance

The Fund is currently preparing a large-scale commemoration of China's four-year struggle for freedom. At that time, hundreds of thousands of copies of the booklet "Four Years of Resistance and Construction" will be printed, detailing the development and unique progress of China's original strength during the war of resistance, in order to promote the British people's universal understanding of China. A "One Bowl of Rice Dinner" will also be held on July 17 to raise relief funds for the war-stricken people in China. Ambassador Gu Weijun, who is stationed in Lisbon, will preside over this grand event. Commemorative meetings will also be held throughout the UK to make the British public understand the work that China has undertaken and is currently undertaking in the common struggle to liberate the world from Axis enslavement. Lord Lykeydolwell, Chairman of the Aid to China Fund, published an article in the Manchester Guardian, urging the British to raise funds to relieve the war victims in China and awakening the British people to the importance of China's war efforts becoming one of the three pillars of world freedom, and said that in the past few months, hundreds of people have followed the path initiated by the Aid to China Fund. The Aid to China Fund has also helped organize an industrial organization to link the work of British aid with Chinese industrial cooperatives.

### Silence Commemorates the Passing of the Premier in Guangzhou; the Spirit of the Premier's Adaptability Should be Emulated; the Movement to Save Lives Through Thrift Should Continue

Yesterday was the 19th anniversary of the assassination of the Premier in Guangzhou. Although the Central Government has stipulated that this day and the London assassination on October 11 will be combined with the commemoration of the Premier's first uprising on September 9, all circles still expressed their silence to commemorate the greatness of the Premier's revolutionary personality, and emulated the Premier's spirit of calmness and adaptability in the face of danger to cope with national disasters, struggle hard, strive to move forward, and continue to promote thrift and disaster relief movements to fulfill their national responsibilities.

### Principles of Conciliation by the Industrial Section for Commercial Disputes: The Labor Side Must Accept the Layoff

The labor-management dispute at the Commercial Press has been delayed for nearly two months and has not yet been resolved. Recently, in order to open up the stalemate and conduct negotiations, the labor side formally submitted six conditions to the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council through the Joint Committee of Comrades to convey to the capital side. According to the Hong Kong reply, only the severance payment for non-renewal of the contract will be changed to seven months for those who are less than seven months, and all other requests will be rejected. The Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council also stated that unless the labor side can accept

The Principle of Layoff

They are willing to serve as conciliators, otherwise they will terminate conciliation. In order to seek a direct negotiation opportunity, the labor side passed a resolution at the third meeting to voluntarily propose the first of the original six conditions, and to conduct indirect negotiations through the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The other five conditions will not be abandoned and will be prepared to negotiate directly with the capital side when the door to negotiations is opened, and will be temporarily reserved in time. Yesterday morning, they went to the Industrial Section to hear the news, and Gu Bingyuan announced the second reply from Hong Kong transferred by the capital side.

The severance payment for non-renewal of the contract will be changed to eight months for those who are less than eight months, and the rest will still be rejected. After studying the telegram, the representatives believed that it was ambiguous and deceptive. The so-called eight months will be supplemented for those who are less than eight months. In other words, the comrades with the lowest salary will only get a total of 416 yuan. The comrades with more than 70 yuan actually get nothing, which is too far from the original proposal. They firmly expressed their non-acceptance and asked to convey this to the capital side. In the afternoon, they went to the Industrial Section again to hear the response. As a result, the capital side still

Insisted on the Original Proposal

Without any change, no progress was made. Now, the conference believes that the association has recognized the pain and proposed the conditions in batches, originally hoping to promote direct negotiations, but unexpectedly, the capital side greatly discounted the only first condition. The future of the negotiations is very bleak. It is heard that the labor side will convene another meeting this morning to study the company's telegram and decide on future policies.

### Import and Export Surtax to be Levied for Another Year

The import and export surtax, after being extended for one year from July 1, 29th year, the Ministry of Finance has recently decided to extend the period for another year. The following is a transcript of the Customs Notice: "The Customs's imposition of a 5% surtax on import and export goods according to the tax rate, which was extended for one year from July 1, 29th year, has been previously announced. Now, we continue to receive an order from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the customs surtax should be extended for another year from July 1, 30th year, in accordance with the original plan. This is to inform the public."

### Possible Continued Reduction in Electricity Supply Causes Great Anxiety for Movie Theaters; Company Notifies of Potential 75% Reduction; If Implemented, Only One Showing Per Day Possible

The English-language North China Daily News reported that a key figure at a movie theater recently told a reporter that there is a possibility of a continued reduction in the public concession's electricity supply, which could lead to the complete closure of movie theaters. Therefore, theater operators will hold a meeting tonight (the 16th) to discuss and decide on measures to address the ongoing electricity supply reduction.

Electricity Supply to Theaters Reduced Last Month

The electricity supply to movie theaters was already reduced by 25% last month. Recently, a notice was received from the Shanghai Power Company stating, "If necessary, electricity supply will be reduced by 75% at any time." This severe measure may be implemented imminently. If so, movie theaters will face extremely difficult circumstances. With a 75% reduction in electricity, theaters will only be able to show one film per day, which will not cover expenses. Furthermore, film distributors may not be willing to screen their films under such conditions. If this happens, theaters will have no choice but to close completely.

Tonight's Meeting Will Propose Recommendations

Theater operators have invested heavily in this business and employ many people. The public also relies on theaters for leisure. Therefore, further reductions in electricity would be extremely difficult to manage. At tonight's meeting, theater operators are expected to propose sending letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Power Company, seeking a practical solution to this problem.

### Emergency Epidemic Hospital to Open Next Month

The Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital established a main branch and a branch last year on Avenue Foch and Route Haig, respectively, with 200 beds available. No fees were charged for outpatient services, hospitalization, medication, or address registration. Although only open for three months, it treated over 70,000 impoverished patients. Consequently, people from all walks of life have shown deep sympathy and support. The hospital not only charges no fees but also provides friendly and approachable service. It has been learned from the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Trade Association, which runs the hospital, that in light of the recent hot weather and the impending outbreak of epidemic diseases, they are actively preparing to establish two hospitals and expand the number of beds to 300. The first hospital will remain at its original location on Avenue Foch. The location of the second hospital is still being finalized. The hospital's mission is based on its previous spirit of service, providing free medical care to all, whether outpatient or inpatient, with the sole purpose of thoroughly saving lives. The first hospital is expected to open next month.

### Shanghai Market Fluctuates After US Freezes German and Italian Funds; Quickly Stabilizes; German and Italian Residents May Be Affected

The US's issuance of a new order freezing German and Italian assets in America caused considerable fluctuations in the Shanghai business community yesterday morning (the 16th), especially among Chinese merchants. However, the period was short-lived. The initial sentiment in the market was that the new US freeze order exacerbated the threat of assets in the Far East being frozen in America. As a result, the foreign exchange market opened very strong, and the stock market also showed significant changes.

Freeze Limited to European Countries

After further consideration by the business community, there was relief that the new US freeze order was limited to European countries. The consensus was that the Washington government did not intend to freeze Chinese and Japanese assets in America; otherwise, Washington could have included assets in the Far East when issuing this anti-German order. The market trend quickly reversed. When the exchange rate for US dollars reached $5.4625 to $5.4375 (legal tender for one US dollar is $18.39), banks made large purchases, and the exchange rate then eased. By the afternoon, the US dollar had returned to its base exchange rate of $5.375 on Saturday (legal tender for one US dollar is $18.61).

Definite Information Available in Shanghai This Afternoon

The stock market trend turned firm, and stock prices gradually rose. At noon, Jardine Matheson shares took the lead, rising slightly above $98. Market confidence stabilized and was not disturbed. Commodity market prices initially declined but then recovered. The US banks in Shanghai have not yet received instructions from their headquarters in New York regarding the US freeze order. The freeze order was issued in New York after the close of business last week. The headquarters cannot issue instructions until the market reopens. Therefore, it is expected that these instructions will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (the 17th). The US's issuance of this freeze order will certainly affect the US dollars deposited by German and Italian residents in US banks in Shanghai to some extent. The US dollars deposited by other Axis powers' residents in other banks may also be affected. However, these German and Italian residents seem to have already taken sufficient precautions. Therefore, the US freeze order may not have a significant impact on Shanghai's finances or general commerce.

### Russian Foreman Causes Death; Demand for Punishment

Small workers at the Swire & Co. wharf on the Bund in the French Concession went on strike due to the anger of all the small workers after a Russian foreman pushed small worker Zhang San into the river, causing him to drown. It is now known that after mediation by the French Concession authorities, the strike ended at 11 am yesterday, and the workers resumed work. The Russian foreman was also released yesterday afternoon. The body of the drowned Zhang San is temporarily kept at the Nanshi morgue. The workers will send representatives this morning to meet with company officials, demanding punishment for the perpetrator and compensation for funeral expenses and pensions.

### Changde Ship Unloaded Cargo the Other Day; Cargo Reportedly Released; Conditions Unknown

After negotiations by various companies, the four foreign ships, including the Baoli, that were detained in Yangshupu after arriving in Shanghai from Zhejiang, the Baoli and Anmanli ships, were released after unloading their cargo last week. It is now known that the Italian Changde ship also unloaded its cargo at the Yangshupu wharf the other day. According to well-informed sources in the shipping industry, after several rounds of negotiations, an agreement has been reached regarding the cargo detained on each ship. The Japanese side has allowed each company to retrieve all of its cargo. As for the specific conditions, they are unknown to outsiders. The Portuguese ship Avimari has not yet unloaded its cargo due to unsuccessful negotiations.

### Japanese Thugs Run Rampant; 47 Deported; All Impersonating Military Police and Other Titles; Victims' Losses Reach Hundreds of Thousands

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, recently, various individuals have been impersonating Japanese military police, military police secret agents, translators, or using the military police as a cover to engage in various crimes such as intimidation, fraud, kidnapping, extortion, and freeloading. This activity is extremely prevalent, causing many victims among law-abiding Japanese residents and Chinese people in China. The Japanese military police authorities believe that these actions damage the reputation of the Japanese army. Therefore, they are vigorously investigating and decisively punishing such criminals. From January to April of this year, as many as 47 people have been ordered to return to Japan. The total value of losses to victims is over 300,000 yuan in legal tender and 150,000 yuan in military scrip. Three cases are listed below to illustrate the others.

Investigating Secrets; Intimidation and Fraud

Sonoda Kurazo, a broker in Washington Lane, Qiujiang Road (age 38), heard that a merchant was secretly transporting gold from the interior to Shanghai. He then impersonated military police to intimidate him and demanded 2,000 yuan in "movement fees." He obtained 1,080 yuan at the time. Later, when the merchant was arrested for secretly transporting gold, Sonoda claimed to his family that he could arrange for his release, thereby defrauding them of 250 yuan. In early May, the military police detected this and investigated him.

Collecting Money Under False Pretenses; Extravagant Spending

Onouchi Seijika (age 35) of 235 Jiaxing Road, acquired the public concession's rights to collect night soil in mid-November of last year, upon the order of the military police. He then fraudulently obtained 81,000 yuan under this guise, spending it all on entertainment venues. The military police investigated and exposed him in March of this year.

Colluding With Chinese; Kidnapping and Extortion

Gotō Kaneji, a trader (age 29) of Hengfeng Lane, Shigaota Road, colluded with Chinese worker Fang Zhicai. On March 4th and 5th of this year, they impersonated military police and went to the Yideli (transliteration) factory, which was run by Chinese people. They falsely claimed that the factory's products were substandard and arrested two of the factory's employees, illegally detaining them and demanding 5,000 yuan for their release. The military police learned of this and investigated them. Therefore, the requested ransom was not obtained. In addition, there were many other incidents. Therefore, the authorities hope that the general public, both Chinese and Japanese, will pay attention.

Statement by Japanese Authorities

After the above cases occurred, the military police, to prevent future occurrences, in addition to rigorously cracking down on these activities, also hope that the general public and the authorities will cooperate. On the afternoon of the 15th, the Japanese authorities also issued a statement as follows: "Recently, incidents of individuals impersonating military police secret agents, translators, or using the military police as a cover to engage in various illegal activities have frequently occurred locally. These actions damage the reputation of the Japanese army, which is deeply regrettable. Among these criminals, there are Japanese and Chinese. They exploit the weaknesses of the victims to achieve their desires. The general public, due to selfishness and self-interest, are swayed by their malicious words. Therefore, to prevent future occurrences, it is hoped that the general public will pay attention. It is best to maintain regular contact with the military police. If any of the above incidents occur and their actions are deemed inappropriate, immediately notify the military police without giving them money. Furthermore, Japanese military police, whether in uniform or plainclothes, carry service identification cards, so their identity is extremely clear."

### "Climb No More" Bedbug Powder and Liquid Sell Briskly

The "Climb No More Bedbug Powder" and "Climb No More Bedbug Liquid" produced by Guoxin Company are highly effective in killing bedbugs and have long been famous and widely praised. With the arrival of summer, bedbugs are rampant. The company's retail stores and various distributors, including company pharmacies, department stores, and tobacco shops, are busier than ever. Large quantities are also being shipped to out-of-town customers. However, it has been learned that imitation products with similar names have appeared on the market. The company has issued a solemn notice to users, urging them to carefully identify the "Climb No More" three characters when purchasing, paying attention to the characters "Climb" and "More", to avoid being deceived.

### Tracing a Black-Plate Car; Notification 7182

Within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple police station in Shanghai's West, a black-plate car with the number 7182, carrying several people and firearms, sped past at midnight yesterday. A patrol officer saw the vehicle and suspected its behavior. He attempted to intercept it but was unable to do so due to its excessive speed. Afterwards, the police chief notified all stations to trace the vehicle with that number.

### A Summer Gallery Tour

— Qin

One clear afternoon, I entered the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road with excitement. Climbing to the second floor, I found many visitors had arrived before me. After signing my name, I was greeted by Miss Wu Yuanyi, a student of Mr. Zhang [Shichuan], and I enjoyed a full view of the works of Mr. Zhang and his students.

Miss Wu said that some of Mr. Zhang's works have already been collected by people from all walks of life, and they were specially borrowed for this exhibition. In total, Mr. Zhang's works include oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and pencil drawings. What I remember will be described separately below. Omissions are inevitable, but fortunately, the exhibition will continue until the 19th, so readers can carefully appreciate them.

The first oil painting that caught my eye was a huge one called "Compassion." From a distance, it was impossible to distinguish the visitors from the people in the painting. No wonder so many people were gathered in front of it, reluctant to leave. "Remnants of the Past" is also one of Mr. Zhang's masterpieces. Another one is "Unfinished Creation," in which the people in the painting carry their wives, children, and luggage, looking hurried and haggard, fleeing for their lives among corpses strewn across the ground. Behind them, firelight illuminates the collapsing buildings, creating a sense of terror that evokes a special feeling. Another eye-catching painting is "The Eve of Retreat," a work Mr. Zhang created when he was abroad. There are also "Holy Temple Aura" and "Cold Alley," which cause people to be deep in thought. Still lifes include "Fine Wine and Beautiful Women," which has profound meaning and serves as a warning to the world.

Several of the watercolors are Mr. Zhang's works from his time in Rome, such as "Sunset Over Ancient Castle," "Where Art Convenes," and "Ancient Relics." They have an ancient charm and a different exotic flavor. In today's world of rapid change, these paintings are certainly even more valuable. Still lifes include "Drunken Crabs," which are painted so realistically that anyone who likes this dish will drool at the sight of them!

The sculptures include portraits of Mr. Tian You and Father Rao. There are also several pencil drawings.

Finally, I went to see a part of the works of Mr. Zhang's top students. There was Miss Wu Yuanyi's charcoal sketch, [missing text] portrait, as well as oil paintings, etc., Mr. Tang Zhu's sculptures, Mr. Tian Ran's pencil drawings, and the wonderful works of Mr. Meng Muyi, Mr. Liu Xucang, and Mr. Liu Shunhua. It was truly a dazzling array of beautiful things. After enjoying them all, I also brought back two colorfully printed oil prints.

It is said that Mr. Zhang is not very willing to paint two completely identical works, so those who ordered them later were often disappointed. One foreign lady selected three paintings, but all had already been reserved by those who were quick to act, so she sighed with regret.

When I said goodbye to Miss Wu, it was 5:30, which was the time for the second showing at the Grand Cathay Theater. However, on the stairs of the YMCA, the people visiting were still coming up in an endless stream, which shows how deeply Mr. Zhang's works touch people!

### Suspect Released in Postal Office Robbery Case; Cashier Released Who Was Escorting the Funds; Kunming Headquarters Makes No Statement on Case

In the Shanghai Postal Administration's major robbery case, the Japanese military police solved the case and recovered the original stolen goods, but the postal office has not yet counted them. One of the six suspects from the Savings and Remittance Bureau, who were detained by the Japanese to escort the funds, has been released. A Datong News Agency reporter has learned the truth, which is recorded below:

Senior Official of Savings and Remittance Bureau Released Yesterday

According to information learned by a Datong News Agency reporter, Wang Xuchu, the Chief of the Disbursement Section of the Savings and Remittance Bureau who was escorting the funds, as well as three veteran staff members and two bodyguards, had been detained by the Japanese at the old site of the Yong'an Silver Company in Hongkou for some time. Yesterday, the Japanese military police released Wang Xuchu, the Chief of the Disbursement Section of the Savings and Remittance Bureau.

Five Suspects Still Detained in Hongkou

The Japanese military police stated that the interrogation of the remaining three veteran staff members and one bodyguard who are still detained is complete and that they will all be released within a few days. As for the stolen funds of two million yuan held by the Japanese, the Postal Administration estimates that they can be returned and counted when the five suspects are released in full. Because the case has now come to an end, the bureau has now sent Inspector Okada to contact the Japanese side to prepare.

Headquarters Remains Silent on Case

Director General Zha Peilin of the Administration has reported the progress of the case to the Kunming Postal Administration, but the Headquarters has remained silent throughout and has not sent any instructions to the Bureau. Director General Zha will likely wait until the stolen funds have been counted in full before submitting a detailed report to the Headquarters for review.

### Armed Robbery of Tobacco Shop's Remittance; Over 40,000 Yuan; Near Racecourse Road and Dagu Road

At approximately 9:20 AM yesterday morning, Dongchang Tobacco Shop at 121 Dagu Road in the Public Concession had a large bundle made of Old Knife Brand cigarette paper, containing 44,000 yuan in cash accumulated from daily sales, and sent veteran clerk Gui Chu (age 32, from Ningbo) on a tricycle to the Bank of China at 50 Hankou Road. At the same time, trainee Hong Yongsong was sent with the remittance slip in a rickshaw to escort him. Unexpectedly, while traveling through the bamboo fence section of Racecourse Road and Dagu Road, they were suddenly ambushed by six robbers hiding nearby. Four of the robbers, each holding a handgun, ordered them to remain silent and robbed them of the entire 44,000 yuan in cash. They fled with the loot. Liu and Hong, caught off guard, were at a loss and stunned. They then regained their senses and shouted for help and gave chase. The patrol officer at the scene heard the alarm and rushed over, blowing his whistle and giving chase. As a result, one robber was apprehended and a handgun and two bullets were seized on the spot. The other five robbers escaped without a trace. The patrol officer took the captured robber and the weapons to the police station, and summoned Liu Gui Chu and Hong Yongsong to the station to investigate the robbery and track down the other robbers.

### Forgetting to Close the Car Door Leads to Death

On the afternoon of the 12th of this month at 2:30 PM, an unidentified man in his forties, holding fresh meat, was riding trolley car No. 81 of the French Concession Line 1 from west to east on Avenue Joffre. As it approached No. 442, a commotion broke out inside the car, and passengers rushed to avoid each other. At that time, the car door was not tightly closed, and the man, who was drowsy, was pushed out of the car and fatally injured. It has been learned that the deceased was Wang Songlin, age 46, from Ningbo, who supported himself by selling meat at a stall on Gansidong Road and lived at No. 5 Sanduo Lane, Jiaozhou Road. The family identified the body and claimed it for burial yesterday. The police believe that the ticket seller in the car was negligent at the time and did not close the car door, resulting in death due to professional negligence. After summoning the family for investigation, they were dealt with according to the law.

### Dahua Woolen Mill Products Approved for Domestic Sales

The "Shepherd Circle" trademark national woolen cloth and serge produced by Dahua Woolen Weaving Co., Ltd. in Shanghai has always been welcomed by people from all walks of life. Previously, it was mistakenly listed among the factories whose domestic sales were prohibited. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has investigated and approved the cancellation of the ban on the company's products. It is said that after this, merchants dealing in woolen cloth will actively purchase the product.

### Using Bombs to Intimidate Entertainment Venues; Mastermind Identified; Three Accomplices Arrested Yesterday in Pudong; Many Dance Halls Extorted for Protection Money

The English-language North China Daily News reported that it has been revealed that a criminal gang in Shanghai is using terrorist tactics to extort protection money from theaters. Detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police have obtained leads and arrested two members of the gang in Pudong yesterday afternoon (the 15th). They are currently being held in the police station. It has been learned that the gang sent a letter to the Grand Shanghai Theater, which was bombed last Friday, demanding protection money. The theater sent someone to deliver the money to Pudong. Detectives from the Xinzha police station, who were investigating the case, posed as representatives of the theater and went to negotiate, taking the opportunity to arrest three criminals. The three criminals have confessed that the second bombing of the Grand Shanghai Theater was carried out by them. The gang is led by a Korean and has henchmen spread throughout the city, specializing in extorting money from dance halls and other entertainment venues run by Chinese people.

It is believed that the Grand Shanghai Theater did not pay protection money, resulting in two bombings in the past week, both committed by the gang. The police in both concessions have received reports from several dance halls and are continuing to investigate. It has been learned that a dance hall on Yuqiaqing Road is paying as much as 400 yuan in protection money per day, and has been doing so for a month. Other entertainment venues in both concessions are paying this protection money for the sake of peace and quiet. The number is not small.

### Six Criminals Arrested in Yellow River Road Bombing Case

After receiving a confidential tip from an informant, the French police immediately dispatched detectives to the Public Concession, where they joined forces with Chinese and Western detectives and arrested six criminals at the address. Two handguns, one fake handgun, and dozens of bullets were seized. It was learned that the criminals, at approximately 10:00 PM on the 25th of last month, attempted to carry bombs to Hengfeng Silk Shop in the Eight Immortals Bridge area to intimidate and extort money, but were unsuccessful. They then carried the bombs to the Zhouchuang Silk Shop at 34 Yellow River Road for temporary storage. They were careless when placing the bombs, which detonated immediately, injuring two women and one man, and killing one woman. The police station is paying close attention to this case and is secretly investigating the accomplices at large to bring them to justice.

### Weather Report

The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong, the area here, and the coastal areas south of Ma'an Island are experiencing high heat, humidity, localized thunderstorms, or fog, with gentle easterly winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 4:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in Shanghai reached a high of 79.9 and a low of 65.3. On the same day last year, the temperature reached a high of 80.8 and a low of 68.5.

### War Causes Child Crime to Skyrocket

— Xin Liang

According to an investigation by the British Home Office, the number of child crime cases in the UK in the first four months of 1941 increased by 50% compared to the same period last year. Although there are no detailed statistics available recently, it is believed that the number will not decrease. Due to the war, children's sweet homes have been destroyed in bombings, their relatives have been killed or have left, leaving them unattended, displaced, and destitute. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that the number of crimes has increased.

The British government's remedy is to keep schools open as usual and avoid arbitrary closures. In addition, they also know that simply having children study hard will not achieve good results. Therefore, they are urging local authorities to set up more children's parks, public playgrounds, and children's clubs as much as possible so that they can still have opportunities for physical and mental development after school and after meals.

### Gorky's Courage and Diligence

— Lu He

Once, Gorky and three or four companions were listening to an old woman telling the story of the hunter Galenin. She said, "Galenin was an old man with white hair and terrible eyes who died not long ago. His coffin was not buried underground. Every night, it seems like the old man gets up from his coffin and walks among the graves because he was a magician." As she was saying this, one of the companions rebuked her for lying, and the old woman's son, Floruk, came and said, "Can you sleep there at night? If you lie on the grave and sleep until dawn, I will give you twenty kopecks." So this companion blushed timidly and retreated to the corner. Floruk laughed self-satisfiedly, and the other friends slowly walked away. Floruk then said sarcastically, "Go there, coward! I thought you were street fighters at first, but you are all mice!" At this time, Gorky was unconvinced and couldn't hold back his anger. He had a strong personality, and he felt very humiliated by this ridicule. He walked up to Floruk angrily and said loudly, "Give me a ruble, and I'll go." They agreed on the condition that Gorky lie on the grave until dawn or sit there until dawn without leaving. If the coffin shook or old Galenin came back to life, he was not allowed to leave. Jumping off meant losing. So Gorky went to the grave that night and lay down with a blanket. Floruk and his friends threw rocks to scare him, but he saw through them and was not surprised at all. When dawn came, everyone asked him, "Was there anything strange?" He replied, "What's strange!" His childhood courage was beyond the reach of some adults.

Gorky lived in the home of his master, the pattern designer, and studied very diligently. When his masters were asleep, he would quietly get up and read, walking to the window where the moonlight shone directly on the window. But the small print was too small for his eyesight to see clearly. After thinking for a moment, he took down a copper hand pot from the shelf. The moonlight reflected from it onto the book, making it even more blurry and unclear, even worse than without it. At that time, he ran to the shop and stood under the lamp in front of the idol to read the book. But after tiring, he dozed off in the shop and was discovered by his old stepmother, who beat him until he was covered in red welts. Sometimes he would light a candle at night and study hard, but when the elderly landlady found out, she would tear up the paintings. He tried all kinds of ingenious methods, but he had no candles and no money to buy them. He had to take the remnants of candles from the candlestick, put them in a tin can, pour in some lamp oil, and put in a wick. The fire was flickering and dying, but even though it was inconvenient, he persevered and read many books. This is truly comparable to our country's stories of "catching fireflies in a bag," "reading by the reflection of snow," "hanging from the beams," "carving a hole to get light," and "not peeking into the garden," both Chinese and Western examples. No wonder he eventually became a great writer!

Occupation

### He Died of Illness

— Xia Yin

In the morning, work started at five o'clock. The female workers trickled into the factory. They all had worried faces, opened tired and hungry eyes, and worked listlessly in the vast factory.

As usual, when I walked into the office, my head became involuntarily dizzy. The work was so heavy! There used to be seven accounting staff in the factory, but now there are only three, in order to save expenses. One is the director, who does nothing at all; the other is an old man in his sixties who has a special relationship with the factory, and I have to help him with everything. I am simply doing the entire accounting job.

Not long after work started, a commotion came from the factory floor. I immediately ran out as if flying, and heard them whispering in sympathetic and pitying voices:

"His life is probably in danger!"

"Poor man, his whole family of four depends on him!"

It turned out that a worker from the second drying room had suddenly fallen ill and had already been taken to the hospital. The symptoms were very dangerous.

"This person was originally very strong, but since he started working in the drying room, he has become weaker and weaker day by day, and his face has become withered, yellow, and terrible. His family..." They continued to tell the story.

I couldn't bear to listen any longer, sighed, and quietly walked away. Yes, whether it's spring, summer, autumn, or winter, if a person works hard day and night in a high-temperature drying room, how can he not be suffocated? As I thought about this, my heart began to ache. Is my youthful vitality also gradually disappearing?

After a while, the expected news came: the person died before being taken to the hospital. In the office, the manager and senior staff were discussing:

"He died of illness, it's none of our business."

"Seeing that he's pitiful, just give him ten yuan for funeral expenses!"

Unease and anger filled my heart. After I record this funeral expense, I also have to record those so-called official expenses:

"Expenses for Mr. So-and-so's dinner party: one hundred yuan"

"Expenses for Mr. So-and-so's trip to Hong Kong: five hundred yuan"

"Mr. So-and-so's entertainment expenses: two hundred yuan."

I know very well that those expenses are entirely for personal matters. Renting rooms, going to dance halls, playing mahjong, gambling with cards, indulging in extravagance, just hiding it from the manager. But for the unfortunate dead worker, his life is cheaper than yellow mud.

"He died of illness, it's none of our business." The manager's smug voice echoed in my ears.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(9) A Strange Peasant

This isn't to say that he has any special connection to the wet nurse herself or her family, requiring them to stay together forever; in reality, this is just a simple matter. Because when people are together, whether they are parents and children, husband and wife, siblings, colleagues, or master and servant…, as long as they've been together for a particularly long time, it's inevitable that a special kind of feeling will develop, and once they hear they have to separate, everyone's heart will feel somewhat empty and uneasy. Moreover, Begonia is originally a very sensitive person.

He stood in front of the pit, lowered his head, and couldn't say anything for a long time; Little Meibao's nimble eyes kept darting around on his short, disheveled hair.

"Dad, are they really going…! Going back? Bao Bao will be alone at home…and won't have a playmate anymore! Mom isn't coming back either…" After she said this, she couldn't help but start sobbing.

Her crying made Begonia's heart even more troubled.

He wanted to go out immediately and ask Wang Si and the wet nurse, but in the past few months, the expression on the couple's faces and the private conversations they had revealed were enough to prove that what Little Meibao said was very likely, so what was the point of asking them?

"Good child, go to sleep! Dad will go and ask them tomorrow." After forcibly calming himself down, he tried his best to urge Meibao to go to sleep.

He himself walked back and forth in the room, and the agitation of his thoughts made him feel more uncomfortable than seasickness; in fact, among these fluctuating thoughts, the strongest undercurrent was still his never-forgotten Xiangqi from the past few years.

In these past few years, he has told everyone that Meibao's mother died in Tianjin, and the only people who know that she is not dead and that he is constantly thinking of her are Meibao and the wet nurse. (134)

### Reveille's Disturbance

— Ke Zhong

People who have received military training generally have a feeling that one of the most annoying and difficult things to get used to is having to get up as soon as they hear the reveille in the early morning. At this time, the sky is still dark, and all around is hazy. If it is in winter, the cold wind is even more biting, making people uncomfortable. This difficult moment is something that even the most veteran soldiers find difficult to deal with. Sometimes, they even mistakenly think that the sound of the bugle is part of a good dream, and continue to sleep soundly.

Recently, the bugler in the military camp at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, USA, had a stroke of genius and suddenly came up with an idea: he invented blowing the bugle on a loudspeaker, so that the soldiers in the camp could all jump up. According to him, the mess call doesn't need to be blown so loud.

### A Peculiar Custom of Courtship

— Zeng Xiu

The women of the Yugoslav ethnic group have a peculiar custom of courtship, which can be said to be unbelievable. They dig up a piece of soil from the place where their lovers have walked and left footprints, and put it in a flowerpot. Then they plant a marigold in that flowerpot—they believe that this plant will never wither. As the golden flowers of the marigold gradually grow and never fade, their lovers' love also gradually grows and never fades. The soil from the places where lovers have walked will facilitate pair after pair of happy couples, and the Old Man in the Moon should naturally retreat three times.

### After Watching "A Dream in an Ancient Temple"

— Qian Di

The Yiyou Society specially invited Mr. Afu Xiamoluo, a "China Expert," to lead the Chinese Drama and Dance Troupe to perform his carefully crafted work "A Dream in an Ancient Temple" at the Lyceum, with the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra providing accompaniment, in order to raise funds for the Yiyou Hospital. There were over ten male and female actors, and they originally performed Peking Opera at the Tianchan, Huangjin, Carlton, Gongwutai, Datutai, and Jiexi Theaters.

Here, let me write down some of the content of the story, as well as my thoughts after watching it.

If we were to say that we went to see this play entirely to seek fun and excitement, then you would be very disappointed, because the story of "A Dream in an Ancient Temple" is very simple. It has no fun or excitement. Originally, Mr. Afu Xiamoluo's original intention was just to use these themes as a framework for composing music; however, when standing at the pinnacle of drama and appreciating it with an artistic eye, it gives you too many benefits, so that after you've seen it, the contours of the characters in the play still linger in your mind. Their laughter, crying, hatred, and anger are as if you yourself are performing in this way, as if your closest thousands upon thousands of friends are performing in this way.

The first act is a setting of an ancient temple, with an old monk sitting on the side and a Thousand-Hand Guanyin in the middle. The plot is that Miss Huiyun, accompanied by a maid, comes out to worship Guanyin. In the second act, Lian has a nightmare, and then sees two suitors dueling with a demon one after another. As a result, Piyong (a frivolous young man) loses, and Minyong (a loyal young man) wins. The third act takes place in a garden, where many people celebrate Minyong's victory with acting, and the lovers finally get married.

Zhang Meilin, who plays Huilian, is very gentle in terms of body, stage steps, and expressions. Cui Yanfang's leadership of the Thousand-Hand Guanyin, with five people lined up in a row, making various hand gestures, is extremely skilled. Xu Futing's Demon King, with his terrifying makeup, is extremely evil! Black marks are drawn on the hands and feet of the four demons, which symbolizes the horror of the demons and is just right. Piyong's staff twirling is fast and rapid, rapid and fast, it's really a case of "only seeing the staff flowers, not seeing the person." Minyong's knifeplay is powerful, skillful, and quite extraordinary. In addition, Zhang Liankui, who plays the monk Zhihe, and Ma Xiurong and Cao Lixia, who play the little maids, also put in a lot of effort.

What we are worth mentioning is that it is said that when those actors first started training, they didn't understand the director's language and didn't understand the rhythm of Western music. They only relied on shouting "one, two, three, four" and painstakingly studying. Now, after seven months, they are meeting the audience. Every move they make is in rhythm, and they can express the actions of the face, hands, and feet according to the high and low of the music, and express "happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy." When the music is playing, you will hear all kinds of brave, cowardly, desolate, and tragic sounds. These sounds seem to be coming from the actors' toes—light and lively. The high notes of the violin in the second act, along with the soft sobbing of the trumpet, made my emotions uncontrollable. I doubted whether I was in another world at this moment.

Replacing language with musical rhythm and explaining the story with the expression of movements is a highlight of Chinese dance dramas. This play may not be acceptable to the general superficial audience who are looking for fun and excitement. However, I admire Mr. Afu and Moluofu's hard work, and believe that they have made the greatest efforts to promote ancient Chinese art.

### Art Scene Stroll

— Yuan Shen

Wei Ruhui, the author of "Hong Xiannu," recently wrote an ancient costume script for the Shanghai Drama Society, entitled: "The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl." The play is scheduled to be staged during the Qiqiao Festival in the lunar calendar.

In "Qing Palace Grievances," which is about to be staged by the Tianfeng Drama Society, Yin will play Consort Zhen, and Shu Di will play Emperor Guangxu. As for the most important role in the whole play, the Empress Dowager Cixi, it was originally intended to be played by Lan Lan, but it is said that Lan Lan has declined because of poor health. Dafeng intends to hire Bo Li to fill the role.

Yiren Jiangfei has recently been directing "Ren Zhi Chu" for "Zhongzhi Yi" and is quite busy. It is said that the play will be performed at the Russian Art Theater this month.

Chang Shaoyue, the host of the Modern Film and Drama Actors' School, is enthusiastic about promoting woodcuts and has established the ABC Woodcut School Correspondence Class to train woodcut talents. It is said that the registration office is located at No. 14 Yong'an Lane, Xindagu Road, Tongfu Road.

Shi Hui, the protagonist of "Song of Righteousness," and Tai Shen, who plays Tai Shen, almost fainted when the Sunday market was about to end. Later, after a doctor gave him an injection, he reluctantly took the stage for the night market. It is said that although the box office for "Song of Righteousness" is good, the performance period may have to be shortened to the 15th of this month in order to regulate the actors' spirits and wait for the autumn to cool down before performing again.

Chapter 11 A Valiant Appearance in a Fierce Battle

At this time, the atmosphere in Daizhou had changed again. Outside the city, it was cold and desolate, with few pedestrians, and every household was closed. Many of the Bai people who lived near the city had already moved into the city. On the city walls, banners and flags fluttered, spears and halberds stood in rows, and many soldiers patrolled back and forth along the walls. The city gates were also half-open and half-closed, with soldiers guarding them. At this time, a scouting horse galloped like a shooting star. When Xu Jing went forward to inquire, the scout said breathlessly: "The rebels are only thirty miles away from the city." Xu Jing was greatly surprised, feeling that the rebels were using their troops too quickly. He hurriedly followed into the city, went straight to the general's yamen, dismounted in front of the yamen gate, and went to visit Zhou Yuji. At this time, Wang Yongtai and deputy generals Zhang Lie, Fan Cheng, and others were all present. Xu Jing greeted them one by one and sat down on the side. Zhou Yuji first asked: "Why didn't Liu Yinying come?" Xu Jing said: "This humble officer was summoned by the general, and originally, Lord Liu intended to come. But he had to discuss it with his aunt before he could start out, and he also had some private matters to deal with, so he let this humble officer come to receive orders first. He asked me to convey to the general that he will definitely be able to come to the camp to serve within a few days." Zhou Yuji nodded and said: "Very well, we must work together to repel the rebels and protect this place, so as to avoid the devastation of the people." He then told them about the rampant nature of the rebels. Xu Jing then learned that Li Zicheng and other large groups of bandits had captured Taiyuan, the provincial capital, Jin Wang Qiugui was captured, and the provincial governor Cha Maode and others had also died in battle. The rebels had successively captured Licheng, Linjin, Lu'an, and other places, and were heading straight for Daizhou with great momentum, and had become a prairie fire. Now that they are dividing their troops into three routes to attack, they should not be underestimated. Xu Jing then asked: "According to the general's high opinion, which should come first, battle or defense?" Zhou Yuji smiled slightly and said: "We must be able to fight before we can defend. If they surround us on all sides, even if we can defend, but we have no food inside and no reinforcements outside, we will fail sooner or later. Therefore, my plan is to fight first. When their vanguard arrives, we will send out elite soldiers to give them a head-on blow. If we can win, it will also make the rebels suffer a setback and boost our morale. I have already talked with the old hero Wang. He is willing to lead his men out to fight. This general will follow up and respond, to test the strength of the rebels. (91)

### New Language of the Drama Scene

— Yizhi

Huangjin's new actors Zheng Bingru, Ji Yuliang, and a party of more than twenty people arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Yu Zhenfei took a plane and is expected to arrive today. They are scheduled to take the stage on the tenth.

The new actors Xu Dongming, Xu Dongxia, Zhou Jijun, Guan Shengji, etc. from the Carlton also arrived in Shanghai yesterday and are staying at the Wenzhou Hotel.
