### Multiple Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing, Dropping Bombs Over Downtown Areas, British Ambassador's Residence Damaged by Bombs, Bomb Lands in American Church School

Chongqing – At 1:00 PM today, sixty-three Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing, killing over fifty people, injuring two hundred, and slightly damaging the British Ambassador's residence and several American church schools. The sky was clear today, and the Japanese aircraft flew over the city of Chongqing, directly reaching the area near the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, dropping countless large and small bombs in densely populated areas. Most of the casualties occurred in this area because the people living along the river did not have time to escape to the air-raid shelters. The Japanese aircraft then bombed the entire city, especially the suburbs along the Jialing River. When British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and his staff were sheltering in an air-raid shelter, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on the Ambassador's residence, causing minor damage. The doors and windows were blown out, and the plaster on the walls was shaken off. The British Air Attache's car was destroyed. The Jialing Hotel, the only Western-style hotel in Chongqing, was also damaged by a small bomb. There were six fires, but they were extinguished within an hour.

Editorial

### The Purpose of Public Lectures in Shanghai

In Shanghai, a city whose society has become increasingly polluted, whose phenomena are disordered and turbulent in recent years, there are still scholars and gentlemen who gather their comrades to give public lectures; each meeting is filled to capacity, and those who arrive late have almost no room to stand; this is truly commendable and rare, and not merely a matter of superficial embellishment. Shanghai was once prosperous, rapidly ascending to the ranks of the world's leading cities; but when measured against the cultural institutions and spiritual life of a modern city, it lags far behind. In their spare time, the citizens of Shanghai engage in the following activities: the more refined sip tea and read books, or play a game of chess; the next tier watch movies or go to the theater; and the lowest tier play mahjong all night, gamble, and indulge in feasting, drinking, dancing, and brothels. As for those who live in seclusion, their spirits are low, and they consider themselves virtuous for keeping to themselves. The more lacking the spiritual cultivation of the general population, the more unstable the foundation of society will become; when material desires become extremely strong, aspirations and conduct become base, and contention becomes frequent and intense: public lectures are one of the best ways to engage in social and collective spiritual cultivation.

The practice of lecturing flourished in the Han Dynasty; the so-called learning at that time was the study of the "Classics of Poetry," "Book of Documents," "Book of Rites," and "Book of Changes," as well as the commentaries on them; each followed the teachings of their teachers, elaborating on the subtle meanings and profound principles; those that were sufficient to serve as models for the world were universally followed, becoming masters of their generation; this is the origin of the schools of thought of various individuals. The practice of lecturing became even more prevalent in the Eastern Han Dynasty, promoting integrity and emphasizing moral character, so that even Cao Cao, a hero of his time, whose power rivaled that of the emperor, still did not dare to openly usurp the throne of the Han Dynasty, precisely because the remaining influence of this practice had not disappeared, and there was a force that prevented him from doing so. In the late Ming Dynasty, Wang Shouren gathered students in the military, and Xu Jie lectured on statecraft, which opened the way for Gu Xiancheng and others to lecture at the Donglin Academy; their noble conduct became the standard for scholars. Although some argued that the downfall of the Ming Dynasty was caused by the disputes between gentlemen and petty men and the retaliatory actions that followed, the Qing army did not unify China until eighteen years after the Shunzhi reign, which shows that the morale and customs of the people who had cultivation could not be easily disregarded.

What is the purpose of lecturing? It is to share the knowledge and experience of predecessors, as well as one's own experiences in self-cultivation, with the public; there are things that cannot be fully expressed in writing, and there are profound principles that cannot be fully understood without questioning and debate, and must be explained through lecturing. Moreover, it is not only the words and principles that are thought-provoking and enlightening, but also the lecturer's personality and demeanor, which, intentionally or unintentionally, imperceptibly influence the audience, inspiring them to feel respect and love. Thus, the lecturer's words can serve as a model, and their actions can be taken as a standard, and the effectiveness is so great that it cannot be measured. There are two main aspects to lecturing: one is the moral aspect, the cultivation and refinement of the spirit; and the other is the academic aspect, the imparting and supplementing of knowledge. However, the arguments should not be too lofty, as this will cause the listeners to become tired and unable to relate. Nor should they be too old, as this will not be in line with the times and will not be accepted by the general public. Nor should they be biased towards religious doctrines, as non-religious people will not enter the door. Nor should they be based on the views of one sect or one school of thought, as this will inevitably lead to factional disputes. It is also known that it is impossible to reconcile different views, but to pick up one or two points and forcibly claim that they can be reconciled is not only troublesome, but also commits the error of clinging to assumptions. Each religion has its own standpoint, and to cut off the long and take the short, taking a mere fragment and claiming it to be the same, is not only heretical, but will also be seen as an outsider by those who believe in religion. What China lacks is science; but specialized science is not something that everyone can understand, so it must be presented in a way that is both profound and accessible, so that people can understand the true spirit of science and its importance in governing oneself and regulating things. What afflicts the Chinese people is that there is too much theory and too little practice, so that they can talk but not act; this is still a habit accumulated by literati over thousands of years. Now, we should abandon empty rhetoric and speak of practicalities, so that each point has its own spirit and its own achievements, which is to say that we should value action over words.

Therefore, what we hope for from the lecturers is that, at this time, they will keep the world and people's hearts in mind, and resolutely engage in academic lectures, which is a pillar of support in the midst of rampant material desires. But be careful not to quibble over differences and gains and losses, for even if they are the same or different, they are merely fodder for idle talk, and what benefit is there to the body and mind? It is appropriate to give systematic lectures, whether they are on religion, philosophy, or science, and they must be primarily aimed at making a tangible contribution to society. In particular, the Chinese people should not be ignorant of Chinese affairs, and the youth of today are ignorant of the meaning of China's inherent moral culture, and they often criticize it. In fact, what do they know? To dare to criticize without research is certainly absurd, but this is not the fault of the youth. The current school education has its own weaknesses, often forcing them to do what they cannot do and teaching them what they do not learn, which is still a small matter. Moreover, they are instilled with seemingly true but actually false words, and what do the youth know? Preconceived notions take precedence, and it is impossible for them not to be led astray; therefore, we hope that the school authorities will correct their mistakes, and we also hope that the lectures can make up for the shortcomings of school education, correct the thinking of the youth, and teach them the ways to automatically study academics. This is what is urgently needed in today's lectures, which should focus on the general level of society and its needs, and promote the inherent culture and morality, instill the ever-new spirit of science, and use the lecturer's morality and knowledge to exert a personal influence, combining the three in a way that is interesting and becomes a trend, so that people will not be tempted by base and licentious entertainment, and the path of academic public research and the great wish to improve society can also be achieved.

### U.S. Treasury Secretary Says Stabilization Fund Benefits the Stability of the Legal Tender; Source of Funds Proposed by the United States; U.S. to Continue Supply Until Next Year

Washington – Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. told the House Coinage Committee yesterday that the $50 million lent to China by the United States on April 25, and the £5 million lent to China by Britain, "are extremely important to China's legal tender issue and its monetary war against Ning and North China. In fact, this measure will help the position of Chinese currency to some extent." The Secretary testified in support of a bill to continue supplying the Stabilization Fund until June 30, 1943. He looked back at the agreement with China, which was intended to stabilize the exchange rate between the Chinese and American currencies. He explained that this agreement also included the establishment by China of a "Chinese Yuan and U.S. Dollar" Stabilization Fund. Morgenthau Jr. also said, "The source of this Stabilization Fund will be funds provided by the United States and funds donated by the Chinese government banks." The Chinese government has selected five people to form a committee to handle this fund. The committee will also handle the "Chinese Yuan and Pound" fund. Morgenthau Jr. also asked Congress to continue to authorize President Roosevelt to reduce the gold content of the U.S. dollar. (9th United Press Dispatch)

Chongqing – The Ta Kung Pao newspaper advocated today for close military cooperation between China and the United States.

At the same time, we must also cooperate and take concerted action in air warfare. We should follow the proposal of US Senator Pepper and use fifty Flying Fortresses to solve the threat from Japan. Ten years ago, US Secretary of State Stimson advocated maintaining justice and resolving the Manchurian crisis, but the United States at that time considered this view to be empty talk. Now this view has become action. The people of China have recently heard the speeches of Stimson, Pepper, and Secretary of the Navy Knox, and feel very excited." (9th United Press Dispatch)

### Military Supplies Ship Bound for England Suffers Heavy Losses

London – U.S. Senator Vandenberg previously stated that in the first three months of this year, only eight out of 205 ships carrying supplies from the U.S. to England were sunk. However, according to key London sources, the figures on British ship sinkings released by Vandenberg are not entirely accurate. Even if they are correct, they would completely misrepresent the seriousness of the situation. Ships carrying complete war equipment are naturally given the greatest possible protection. Therefore, the percentage of sinkings of such ships is lower than that of other ships carrying equally important but less valuable supplies such as steel and food. This proves that providing adequate protection to shipping can minimize losses. However, the shipping situation must be considered comprehensively. The importance of airplanes and tanks is certainly greater than that of any other items, but without food supplies, airplanes and tanks are also useless. If ship tonnage decreases, ships that originally carried ammunition will inevitably be used to transport food. Figures to be released soon by the British Admiralty will show that although the situation in the Atlantic has improved in recent months, losses in the Mediterranean mean that the total tonnage of Allied ships lost is almost as significant as in any previous month.

### Axis Powers Actively Deploying Military Forces, Major War Brewing in the Near East, Anti-Government Demonstrations Erupt in Baghdad, Prime Minister Gailani's Flight Unconfirmed

London – London newspapers today expressed congratulations on the reported flight of Iraqi Prime Minister Ali Gailani from Baghdad, calling it a sign of the collapse of Iraqi resistance. However, the Cairo newspaper "Al-Ahram" warned that the war in the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East could suddenly escalate dramatically. "The Daily Telegraph" stated, "Confirmation of Ali Gailani's flight would mean the collapse of the rebellion and the re-establishment of a government eager to cooperate with Britain against the Axis." "The Daily Mail" commented, "This means that Iraq, in just one week, has overthrown those who tore up the Anglo-Iraqi treaty."

Marshal Pétain, who is currently resting in southern France, regards this agreement as extremely serious and has set off to return to Vichy. (Reuters, 9th)

Vichy – A Vichy news agency message, criticizing Darlan's agreement with the Nazis, anticipates that France will continue to enter into other agreements with Germany. It claims that we do not exaggerate the hopes that may arise, but we may as well anticipate that this agreement can safely navigate the first obstacle on the road opened by Darlan. (Reuters, 9th)

Vichy – Deputy Prime Minister Admiral Darlan once again went to Paris at 11:00 AM this morning to continue negotiations with German Ambassador Abetz. Marshal Pétain, after listening to Darlan's report via telephone, is still vacationing on the French Riviera and will return to the capital next Monday morning. (Havas News Agency, 9th)

London – The Free French news agency does not believe that the recent meeting between Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan and Nazi official Abetz in Paris has anything to do with Syria. The agency says that the concessions made by the Vichy government to the Germans are mainly in the industrial field. France has agreed to assist in the repair of German tanks and submarines, according to an agreement signed a few days ago between French and German automobile industries. (Reuters, 9th)

### French Amnesty Grants Freedom to Thousands of Criminals

Vichy – Following Marshal Pétain's proclamation of an amnesty on "May Day," 1,090 criminals have been ordered to be released. Among them, 500 were convicted of administrative offenses and are granted freedom. In addition, the punishments of 179 people previously sentenced by civil courts and 380 people sentenced by military courts have been revoked. The remaining 30 people are granted conditional freedom.

### American Government and Public Advancing Towards Participation in the War, House Naval Affairs Committee Proposes Adding 58 Auxiliary Ships

Washington – American officials are very pleased that British Prime Minister Churchill has secured a large majority in the House of Commons. They are now discussing what actions the United States should take in the near future. They feel that the period of debate and discussion is gradually coming to an end, and action must be taken in the future. Either eliminate the possibility of the United States entering the war, or take concrete steps towards participation. Officials and others now feel that President Roosevelt, relying on enlightened public opinion, will be backed by the majority of public opinion if he leads towards participation in the war. Those close to the authorities believe that the President understands how important this decision is and will not announce it until he is prepared. However, this decision will not be delayed for several weeks. The isolationist newspaper "The Evening Star" recently published an editorial criticizing Secretary of War Stimson for commenting on naval policy. This is the first isolationist criticism Washington has seen in weeks. However, the paper also anticipates that the United States will soon enter the war and recognizes that Stimson's remarks are part of America's preparation for active participation in the war. (Reuters, 9th)

Washington – Several congressional leaders predicted yesterday that President Roosevelt would announce within fourteen days that American convoys would escort supply ships to England. The same sources publicly stated that "demands for armed escorts have gradually increased, and the President will respond." A few advisors have forcefully argued against this, stating that the President said, "Convoying is war," and that the President has guaranteed not to involve the United States in the war. For two weeks, congressmen have been anxious about the terrible war, but now they know that disaster is visible and inevitable. They anticipate that as soon as the President believes the country is "ready," he will order convoys. The issue of convoys still occupies an important place in congressional debate. According to Secretary of the Navy Knox, Britain has repeatedly requested reinforcements of 115 smaller ships. At the same time, the public is favorably impressed by Secretary of War Stimson's speech, but non-interventionists are particularly angry. This speech must have been approved by the President. Senator Nye, a Republican from North Dakota, said, "This speech is just part of a blitzkrieg to drag people into convoys and then drag them into war." (International News Agency, 9th)

Senate to Debate Naval Convoy Proposal

Washington – The Senate Commerce Committee met today, with the chairman of the Maritime Commission, Land, reporting on the number of British merchant ships sunk in the Atlantic. The Commerce Committee has decided to hold a closed-door meeting next Monday (the 12th) to continue discussing the proposal to authorize the President to requisition foreign ships stranded in American ports. In the Senate, a plenary session will be held next week to debate the proposal. It is heard that several senators who oppose the convoy plan are preparing to introduce amendments at that time, stipulating that the US Navy is prohibited from escorting war supplies abroad. However, some senators, influenced by yesterday's speeches by Secretary of the Navy Knox and Republican leader Willkie, as well as today's report by Land, have firmly advocated using the US Navy to aid Britain. (Havas News Agency, 8th)

25 American Ships Leased to Canada

Washington – The American Alcoa Steamship Company has leased 25 cargo ships to a Canadian company to operate, and they have been re-registered in Canada. The British newspapers have been approved by the Maritime Commission. According to these ships, they are only allowed to sail in Western Hemisphere waters, traveling between American, Canadian, and Latin American ports, mainly transporting sugar, oil, iron, bauxite, and other goods. (International Telegraph, 9th)

North and South American Navies to Unite

Washington – Yesterday, it was believed here that the mutual assistance activities of the Latin American and American navies could be discussed during the visit of naval representatives from eleven Latin American countries. Secretary of State Hull said at the State Department's welcome reception for the representatives, "The Americas have recognized that the threat of crisis is approaching. We feel it is extremely important to connect and cooperate in all practical ways to enhance the effectiveness of our common defense." It is generally believed that the words of the US Secretary of State imply naval cooperation between North and South America. It is noted that the Latin American representatives were invited last month by Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations. Observers recall that such invitations were very unusual at the time, as the move was directly presided over by the Chief of Naval Operations, rather than through the State Department. (Associated Press, 9th)

Stark's Speech Calls for South American Cooperation

Washington – US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark yesterday spoke to naval representatives from eleven Latin American countries, saying that the Americas are determined to take whatever steps are necessary to keep the Western Hemisphere out of war. Stark's speech was delivered at a banquet in honor of the eleven representatives. Stark also said that the gathering of naval leaders from the American countries was a first in history. Prior to Stark's speech, the American naval leaders and high-ranking naval officers held a long meeting to discuss the issues in the Western Hemisphere caused by the European war. It is rumored that the issue of cooperation between the Latin American and American navies was also discussed. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Nazi Aircraft Raid Britain, First Use of Oil Bombs, German Aircraft Destroyed 63 in Two Days, British Air Force Fiercely Attacks Hamburg and Berlin

London – Although many German aircraft were shot down by Royal Air Force night fighters, setting an unprecedented record, they still swarmed over the British Isles and Northern Ireland last night and this morning, intensifying their attacks. At least 39 German aircraft were shot down after dusk on Wednesday, and another 24 were shot down in a night raid last night. It is understood that German aircraft have attacked almost all areas of Britain, including London. The London air raid siren stopped at 4:30 AM. The main target of the German aircraft seemed to be a town on the northeast coast and a town in the eastern part of the Midlands. Hundreds of German aircraft, lined up one after another, flew from the sea to northeastern Britain, not only dropping explosive and incendiary bombs, but also dropping huge oil bombs. Oil bombs were used for the first time in months, and their purpose was to spread the fire. A town in the Midlands was ravaged by oil bombs for several hours. The British admit that there were significant losses and casualties in both places. (International Telegraph, 9th)

London – The number of British aircraft bombing Germany last night was unprecedented since the start of the war. Hamburg, Bremen, Emden, and Berlin were the main targets of their air raids. The German official news agency admitted that Hamburg, Bremen, and other parts of northwestern Germany were heavily bombed. (Reuters, 9th)

### German Forces Besiege Tobruk, Use Flamethrowers, Finally Repelled by British Defenders

Tobruk under Siege – British Imperial overseas troops today repelled German infantry wearing hoods, all armed with flamethrowers, and dragged flamethrowers by tanks, trying to burn out the Australian defenders in the underground tunnels. However, the British artillery positions were well-placed, and the artillery fire was accurate, destroying the German flamethrowing equipment. The British are very confident that the German soldiers lack water, because the prisoners drank heavily when they arrived at the camp. The Australian soldiers praised the British artillery, saying that their artillery never misses, blasting the German trucks that came to attack into the sky. (Associated Press, 3rd) (Delayed)

### Soviet Red Army Transfer to Western Border Denied, Soviet Union Solemnly Denies, Black Sea and Caspian Sea Fleets Not Moved, Japanese Fabrication Ridiculous

Moscow – TASS has released the following statement: "Japanese newspapers quoted a New York report from the Domei News Agency, claiming that, according to a Vichy correspondent for the Associated Press, the Soviet Union is now concentrating a large number of troops on its western border. The agency also stated that the Moscow diplomatic community also pointed out that the scale of the Soviet military concentration on the western border was particularly large. Due to the continuous transportation of Soviet troops from the Far East to the West, traffic on the Siberian Railway has been suspended. It is said that a large number of troops were transported from Central Asia to the area. Two major groups of air force reserves have been placed under the direct command of the Supreme Command, one of which has been authorized by the authorities to be freely dispatched and used by the Kiev Military District. The force includes 1,800 bombers and 900 fighters. The Black Sea and Caspian Sea fleets have also been strengthened by the addition of Baltic Sea warships. It is said that 28 submarines, 45 destroyers, and 18 gunboats have been moved. A military delegation led by Kuznetsov has left Moscow for Dessau, Germany. The delegation's appointment is related to the issue of the Soviet Union freely using airfields in central and western Iran." TASS has been officially authorized to declare that this doubtful and sensational report by Domei is copied from an unnamed Associated Press correspondent. The content is entirely a masterpiece of fantasy written by someone delirious. Comrade Kuznetsov has not gone to Dessau, Germany, and remains in Moscow. The Baltic Fleet's submarines and destroyers have not been transferred to the Caspian and Black Seas, neither recently nor before. The Soviet Union has not "concentrated a large number of troops on its western border," nor does it intend to do so. Only one infantry unit is now being transferred from Irkutsk to Novosibirsk, because the military facilities in the Novosibirsk area are better. The Domei News Agency's report on this matter has also been a crude distortion. In addition, the other points mentioned by Domei are purely a delusion." (TASS, 9th)

Different Observations on Stalin's New Position

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that world opinion on Stalin's appointment as Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissars is very inconsistent. Berlin and Rome are unwilling to express any opinion on this change, but this is not the case in East Asia. Newspapers and spokesmen generally argue that the new appointment of Stalin is important, believing that this will definitely have a more beneficial impact on the stable Japan-Soviet relations under the recent neutrality treaty. American public opinion is more objective. Some American newspapers believe that Stalin's assumption of the chairmanship of the People's Commissars is a sign that the Soviet Union has encountered a serious crisis and has had to adjust its institutions in order to quickly implement important decisions. Moscow only broadcast this appointment and did not comment. However, it is worth reiterating that in his message to the Red Army on the May Day holiday, the Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army, Timoshenko, stated, "The Red Army is prepared to annihilate any aggression launched by imperialists against the interests of the Soviet state and the Soviet people." The emphasis on the interests of the Soviet state and people is very meaningful. (Reuters, 9th)

### Soviet Union Does Not Recognize Norway and Belgium as Independent States

Moscow – The Soviet Union has notified the Norwegian and Belgian embassies that, given that the two countries are no longer independent states, they will no longer be recognized diplomatically. (Reuters, 9th)

### Japanese Times Writes Editorial Stating That China Cannot Be Conquered, Still Hoping for a Non-Peaceful End to the War, Making China a Partner in the Co-Prosperity Sphere

Tokyo – The semi-official "Japan Times and Mail" and "Hochi Shimbun" today published editorials stating that Japan cannot conquer China by force. The newspaper advocates adopting a policy that reduces the scale of the war and promotes peace. The "Japan Times and Mail" and "Hochi Shimbun" are widely regarded as organs of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In discussing Japan's policy towards China, the newspaper abandons hope of conquering China by force. The newspaper believes that the war should be reduced in scale in order to promote a peaceful situation and promote trade. It also states that Japan's policy is twofold: one is to restore peace within China, and the other is to develop China and make it a partner in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. The newspaper went on to say that in order to establish peace in China, the war must first be ended. It also said that there are two ways to end the war: one is to eliminate the causes of friction, and the other is to establish an environment sufficient to guarantee an orderly life. The newspaper claims that the view that Japanese withdrawal will allow Chongqing's troops to advance is an open question. Therefore, shortening the front line is a reasonable move to reduce the chance of war. The editorial also says that even from an industrial point of view, Japan should maintain peace and order in a wide area in order to increase trade opportunities. The newspaper goes on to say that China will never cooperate with Japan unless there is a good reason, and that coercion is useless. The newspaper concludes by saying that the rule of the Nanjing government should prove to be a beneficial measure, and the Japanese army should also prove that their position does not affect China's political and territorial integrity.

### Dutch Determination to Resist Aggression: Farewell Speech of Dutch Cabinet Minister

Batavia - The Dutch Colonial Minister, Welter, and the Dutch Foreign Minister, Kleffens, gave their farewell broadcast yesterday before leaving Surabaya, stating briefly that the Dutch East Indies is currently serving the Netherlands to the greatest extent possible. It is well-equipped to cope with any war forced upon it and is therefore an important factor in terms of economics, finance, and military. After the war, the Dutch political mechanism will surely express its recognition of the changed status of the Dutch East Indies during the war. It is expected that the Dutch government will make a more important announcement on this matter at a suitable time and place than this radio address (likely to be announced during the next session of the National Assembly). Welter concluded by saying, "We do not want to be slaves; we are free men and women. The Dutch East Indies Army is ready to be tested. Undoubtedly, if the enemy invades the Dutch East Indies, they will encounter a strong defense of resolute battle." (Reuters, 9th)

Batavia - The Dutch Colonial Minister and Foreign Minister inspected the Surabaya air and naval bases this morning and then took a torpedo boat to visit nearby Madura Island, followed by lunch at the Surabaya Naval Club. (Reuters, 9th)

### Vietnamese-Thai Peace Treaty Signed in Tokyo Yesterday, Containing Twelve Articles

Tokyo - The Information Bureau announced that the French-Thai Peace Treaty was signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 this morning. The terms are almost the same as the mediation agreement signed on March 11th, with twelve articles in addition to the preamble. The first article declares that France and Thailand have restored friendly relations and will soon begin direct diplomatic negotiations to resolve various outstanding issues between the two countries. The second article stipulates the adjustment of borders, ceding the two districts of Battambang and Bassac and most of eastern Cambodia to Thailand. The third article provides for the establishment of a boundary delineation commission. The fifth article stipulates that Thailand is willing to grant absolute equality to legal entities and Thais within the ceded territories of Vietnam and to respect the mausoleum of Luang Prabang. The sixth article stipulates that Thailand will only establish police forces in the ceded territories of Vietnam, without building defensive works or military airfields. The eighth article stipulates the principles for residents in the ceded territories of Vietnam to change their nationality and transfer property. The ninth article stipulates the method for settling financial claims between the two countries arising from the cession of territory, with Thailand paying France six hundred thousand piastres over six years. The tenth article stipulates that if disputes arise in the future interpretation of the agreement, they should be submitted to Japan for mediation. The ratification of the agreement will take place in Tokyo within two months of the signing. The Vietnamese-Thai border, according to the second article, is as follows: Starting from a point where Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar meet in the north, it runs along the Mekong River to a point crossing the 15th parallel of latitude. The Mekong River remains French territory, but Koh Kong Island in the river is ceded to Thailand. The line then proceeds west along the 15th parallel of latitude, then south along a meridian, passing through a point on the current border between Siem Reap and Battambang provinces, Laos. Attached to the agreement are three protocols: (1) withdrawal and handover of the ceded areas; (2) organization and work of the boundary commission; (3) implementation of the conditions of the demilitarized zone. The Japanese government only signed two protocols after the signing and did not sign the agreement itself. The Information Bureau has published French-Japanese and French-Thai protocols on guarantees and political understanding. (Reuters, 9th)

### Matsuoka's Statement

Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka stated that the conclusion of the French-Thai treaty has marked a new era in French-Thai relations. He also said that at a time when the whole world is suffering from the terror of war, the conclusion of this treaty is extremely important. He further stated that the relations between Japan, France, and Thailand will become stronger as a result and will never be weakened or overturned by external forces. (United Press, 9th)

### British Government Conscripts All Seafarers Nationwide: Those with Nautical Experience to Enlist Quickly for National Service

London - British Minister of Shipping Leathers and Minister of Labour Bevin announced yesterday the establishment of a Shipping Reserve Group. All people aged 18 to 60 who served on ships from 1936 onwards and have since changed occupations must join this group. Leathers stated that ships are often delayed because sailors are not immediately available, so this plan is necessary. Sailors will no longer have the freedom to choose their ships. This measure was agreed upon after friendly discussions between representatives of labor and management in the shipping industry, guaranteeing sailors will not lose their jobs, will receive paid vacations, and will not have their wages deducted for waiting for ships. Minister of Labour Bevin stated that this measure applies to pilots and crew members who have left the shipping industry for other jobs, as well as seafarers. He hopes that these people will come back to fight together in the Atlantic war. (Reuters, 9th)

### Random Notes on the European War (5)(2): Miscellaneous News on Strengthening Singapore's Defenses

This is a dispatch from the London Times correspondent in Singapore, translated as follows:

A strong Australian military force has arrived in Singapore to strengthen the defenses of Malaya. On the air force side, a large number of new bombers, variable-pitch engines, and single-engine fighters have recently arrived, indicating that British strength in the Far East is gradually increasing. Although the types of aircraft are not known in detail, it is believed that they are sufficient to give the configuration of the British Air Force in the Far East a new look.

After the announcement of the arrival of the Australian army in Malaya, British Fleet Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, Vice Admiral Layton, issued a statement saying: "The safe arrival of this elite force is very gratifying. This is further proof of Britain's grasp of maritime control. Now, no matter where in the Empire, there will be no weaknesses in defense."

According to official sources, the number of troops transported to Malaya at one time is the largest of any Australian army unit. Although the main force only recently arrived in Singapore, large detachments of Australian troops had landed at various ports earlier, carrying vehicles. The Singapore shipyards were also busy for a long time unloading hundreds of motorcycles.

These troops include infantry, artillery, signal corps, and transport teams. The artillery is equipped with the latest howitzers and field guns, all made in Australia. The tank defense team is equipped with flat-shooting guns manufactured in Australia. They also have ambulance teams, even dental teams, and mobile bacteriological laboratories, postal teams, pay offices, and ordnance depots. The officers and soldiers were transferred from various states in Australia.

When the main force arrived at the entrance of the Singapore naval base, Strait Commander of the Malayan Garrison, Lieutenant General Ponting, and the commander of the Australian army, Major General Bennett, who had led the advance troops, boarded the ship to welcome them. When the ship docked, a group of officials was waiting, including the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, Sir Layton. The Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Thomas, and his wife, and Vice Admiral Trout, later boarded the ship to inspect and delivered a welcome speech on behalf of all the citizens.

As the troop ship approached the pier, the military band played music to welcome them, and the Australian army sang loudly, immediately drowning out the music. Malayan naval soldiers helped tie up the mooring lines, and as they dispersed, the Australian troops crowded on the deck and looked out from the hatchway, cheering for them and the Indian dockworkers, and then throwing Australian coins of one penny, half a penny, three pennies, and six pennies at them. When they saw the welcoming officials, the coins were thrown at them again. The governor and naval and air force officers all picked them up and kept them as souvenirs.

The Australian officers and soldiers and equipment landed and immediately boarded vehicles to go to their defensive positions, proceeding quickly and orderly, impressing all who watched.

Before the Australian army began to land, two trains were waiting to transport them to their defensive positions. The landing soldiers carried their own backpacks, and porters carried light luggage. Shipyard Supervisor General Trout said that such a large number of troops, landing and transporting so quickly, is probably not seen elsewhere, and can reflect the efficiency of the navy and shipyard personnel, and the strict discipline of the landing troops.

The Asians and Europeans in Singapore, who are usually calm, were surprised to see so many unfamiliar soldiers, but there was no unpleasant feeling. The Chinese, Indians, and Malays were amazed to see countless slouch hats for the first time. The Malays' enthusiasm spread to all the villages and towns, and every train station along the army's route felt vibrant. Although the arrival of the Australian army made the local people aware of the dangerous situation in the Far East, general opinion believes that this move may be a turning point, or at least guarantee the safety of Malaya. British, Chinese, Malay, and Indian newspapers all published this matter in the most prominent positions, showing a glimpse of public opinion.

First, the British government appointed Air Marshal Brooke-Popham as Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, with Singapore as his headquarters, and the situation has changed. The unified command of the British army and air force in Malaya, Burma, and Hong Kong is the first time ever. Brooke-Popham works closely with British Fleet Commander-in-Chief in China, Layton, who is now in Singapore a lot. Therefore, Singapore has assumed the responsibility of a large naval base to accommodate the world's largest battleships.

Of course, it is not possible to write in detail about Singapore's defense plans. But I heard that some important decisions have been made. The strength of the troops defending Singapore is still gradually increasing. Anyone who tours the Malayan peninsula can encounter troops everywhere. The strength of the Indian army is especially formidable. Although most of the Indian officers and soldiers are reserves or new recruits, they have all achieved special results in various previous engagements. They are all prepared to make the grade, just needing water to quench their thirst before they go out, and a piece of land to camp on. A regiment that was stationed on the Northwest Frontier of India, mostly Pashtuns from the border area. After they arrived in Singapore, they asked acquaintances, "Where are the enemies?" When they learned that their current task was only passive defense, they were greatly disappointed. When the Pashtuns were free to relax, they surrounded a large pile of fireworks and performed the Khatak dance, bringing the atmosphere of rural life in northern India to tropical Malaya.

These Indian soldiers all carry transport vehicles, and they are completely mechanized. There are no mules or horses in any unit. As for the air force reinforcements, most of them are from Australia and New Zealand. In short, the arrival of the Dominion troops to garrison in Singapore is the first time in history.

### The U.S. Takes China as a Fortress and Launches Large-Scale Aid: Madame Chiang Kai-shek Issues Signed Certificates of Support for China, Receiving $150,000 in Donations in One Month

The China Committee of the United China Relief, with Soong Tzu-wen as its chairman, is making progress. Ambassador Hu Shih has accepted the invitation of the General Association and formally assumed the post of Honorary Chairman of the China Committee. Several members have been appointed by the Committee. The work of the General Association is proceeding smoothly, and the initial preparation and organization work has reached the stage of completion. A large-scale fundraising campaign has already begun. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Bruner, encouraged further efforts with an optimistic spirit to realize the slogan "China Must Get American Aid."

Madame Chiang Kai-shek Donates Certificates of Support for China

The China War Relief Association of Writers, organized by the Writers' Department of the United China Relief, has a considerable number of members since Mrs. Pearl S. Buck worked to promote it. According to news from the General Association, whether Chinese or Westerners, all those who donate more than 100 U.S. dollars to the General Association and obtain the qualifications of members of the Charitable Association of Writers will be given a "Certificate of Support for China" personally signed by Madame Chiang Kai-shek. Now, on the Western side, because of this honorary award, the number of donors has immediately doubled, and they continue to donate enthusiastically, and the future is extremely optimistic. If patriotic overseas Chinese want to show Westerners the sincerity of their donations, they can contact the Writers' Department of the General Association at 1790 Broadway.

Substantial Assistance, Generous Donations

Mr. Bruner, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the General Association, declared to the American people in order to launch a fundraising of 5 million U.S. dollars to aid China, "Now is the time for the whole country, and the United States must immediately realize the importance of China in the Pacific and give it substantial assistance." At the same time, at a meeting of organizers of the General Association's nationwide branches, Mr. Bruner stated that the security of the United States in both the East and West oceans depends on China in the Pacific, just as it depends on Britain in the Atlantic. China is now enduring and fighting to preserve democratic forces, and we should recognize China as a fortress protecting the American way of life in the West. The friendship and cooperation of 450 million Chinese people depends entirely on the aid to China today. Now that the U.S. government has decided on a substantial aid to China policy, how can the American people be unconcerned about the Chinese? We must be generous in our donations so that the Chinese know that we Americans are standing on the same front with them during their stage of enduring warfare."

Donation Achievements Are Already Considerable

From March 1 to April 3, donations from various places reached more than 148,000 U.S. dollars, of which more than 115,000 U.S. dollars were the result of joint efforts by seven groups, including the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China (this number includes the 50,000 U.S. dollars donated to Yale-in-China University by the Lochridge-Lash Fund). The remaining 33,000 U.S. dollars were directly donated to the General Association by enthusiastic people who aided China. All funds raised by the General Association are allocated by the donors in net amounts to purchase medicines, supplies, ambulances, maintain food and clothing for refugees, relieve refugee children, promote industrial cooperation, and maintain the universities run by Americans in China.

### Tomorrow is Parents' Day, Warm Celebrations

Tomorrow (11th) is the first Chinese Parents' Day. The Shanghai New Radio Station will hold an air celebration party. It is scheduled to invite Chen Zhengfan to deliver the opening speech, and Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Zongyu, and others will give speeches on the meaning of Parents' Day. After several primary school students broadcast and sing world-famous filial songs, they will broadcast the entire famous play "Silang Visits His Mother" to promote the Chinese virtue of filial piety. The Hualian Club on Nanjing Road is scheduled to hold a parents' joint party at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow, inviting Dr. Hu Zuyin to give a speech on "Thoughts on Parents' Day" and perform a divorce drama to alert parents. Shanghai Moore Church, Qingtian Church, United Christian Middle School, YMCA, YWCA, and others have already been preparing separately and plan to hold various celebrations tomorrow. Also, according to the regulations of the Christian Association, people from all walks of life (whether children or adults) should wear flowers on Parents' Day to show their remembrance and love for their parents. Those with both parents should wear red flowers, those with deceased parents should wear white flowers, and those with a deceased father or mother should wear blue flowers (light blue). The YWCA at 999 Avenue Road has already made various colors of Parents' Day flowers and sells them for one dime each. The proceeds will be used to subsidize Shanghai nurseries.

### Dr. Ferguson's Speech at the Rotary Club: Shanghai Has Unlimited Prospects, Depending on the Sincere Cooperation of Chinese and Foreign People; the Exercise of Power by the Great Powers Must Have Limits

Dr. John Calvin Ferguson, who served as an advisor to the Chinese government and won honors from China, Japan, France, the United States, and other countries, made a comprehensive exploration of his experience over several decades at a weekly Rotary Club banquet the other day, and delivered a speech, acknowledging that the prosperity of Greater Shanghai is the wish of all citizens, but the path depends on the sincere cooperation of the relevant powers and the Chinese people.

Today's Achievements Only After Great Hardship

It is said that when Dr. Ferguson first arrived in Shanghai in 1887, Shanghai was still a desolate place. Afterwards, due to the development of the powers, it has achieved today's achievements only after great hardship, so the future prosperity is indeed unlimited. Because it will surely become a center of politics, economy, and any other aspect, and promote the interests of China and foreign countries. Unfortunately, in the past half-century, selfish psychology has been found everywhere in Shanghai, which is a major obstacle to future prosperity. Dr. Ferguson also said that the greatness of Shanghai lies in its dependence on internationalism, that is, the power enjoyed by any country involved must have a certain limit. Any overreach of power is enough to promote the imbalance of power among the powers, which seems unlikely to be agreed to by all parties. Today's Shanghai, like its future and past, is sometimes bright and sometimes dark, so the status quo will eventually be clarified.

Chinese and Foreign Cooperation, Moving Forward Together

Dr. Ferguson acknowledged that the sovereignty of Shanghai belongs to the Chinese people, and that Shanghai has been able to have today because of the efforts of the Chinese commercial power. Therefore, foreigners must cooperate with the Chinese to enhance friendship, without which it is not enough to talk about the coexistence and co-prosperity of China and foreign countries. At the same time, he also hoped that the Chinese could cooperate with foreigners to maintain their common interests, because Shanghai is the most modern international city, and Chinese and foreign cooperation is necessary. Chinese and foreign citizens must take the most sincere attitude in social, commercial, and political affairs, so that the prosperity of Shanghai's future can be unlimited.

### Coal Briquette Prices Fall, Dropping More Than Twenty Yuan in Two Days: Market Prices Have Returned to Original Levels

Because of the special environment of this city, some unscrupulous people repeatedly fabricate facts, hold goods for profit, and raise prices. The smoke and white coal needed by various industries and factories in this city every day has mostly been purchased from India, Indochina, and other places since the incident, so the source is not without some difficulty. These people actually used the pretext that the source was not easy, and fiercely raised market prices, making illegal profits. The market prices of various types of smoke and white coal in this city have once been raised to unprecedented highs. It is learned that coal merchants in this city reached separate agreements at the beginning of last month to trade large amounts of smoke and white coal, totaling about 212,000 tons. Now, the coal has been loaded onto ships in the production area and is on its way to Shanghai, so most hoarders have heard the news and feel uneasy, and are urgently seeking to sell large amounts of stockpiles, so that the number of spot chips in the coal market has become more abundant than before, but the buyers are instead shrinking back, and all the spot goods are quite oversupplied, and the market price has begun to fall back. In the past two days, the price of smoke and white coal per ton has fallen by an average of about twenty yuan compared to before, and illegal transactions in the market have gradually disappeared. According to news from various coal industry associations yesterday, the future of the coal market in this city may gradually improve, and the coal briquette market has also returned to the original level of 296 yuan per ton that was previously agreed upon.

Mail to Guangping's Four Villages Suspended

Due to the special local situation, all parcels and large and small packages mailed to the four villages of Guangping in the Beiping area should be temporarily suspended from acceptance, but those mailed to Guangping Chengguan can still be accepted.

### Expected Arrival of Hong Kong Rice; Strict Prohibition of Re-export; Rice Prices Continue to Fall, but Black Market Has Driven Them Up; Government Rice Price May Be Cheaper Than Hong Kong Rice

The Public Concession's Municipal Council's direct purchase of low-priced Rangoon special small-grain rice from the Hong Kong government has been completely processed since the procedures began. The forms filled out by various rice merchants have been submitted to the Jardine Matheson & Co. for verification. Yesterday, it was widely rumored in the city that the first batch of 5,000 tons (50,000 bags) of low-priced foreign rice may arrive as early as today or tomorrow, and will definitely arrive on schedule before the 12th. At that time, the rice merchants who have been approved for sale can present their bills to pick up the goods and resell them to the public. However, any mixing, hiding, or deduction of quantity will be severely punished to meet the original intention of regulating the people's food supply. As for where the rice transport ship is currently docked, there is no definite report.

Yesterday's Rice Price Continued to Plunge

Since the concession authorities directly purchased low-priced foreign rice and the Rice Market Management Committee sought to rectify the rice market's business regulations, the general trading situation in the market has improved day by day. The rice speculators were quite alarmed and successively reduced prices to sell off their long-held stockpiles. The abundance of spot goods in the rice market and the weakening of public confidence are unprecedented recently. After the opening of the rice market yesterday, the general public sentiment was weak and unable to recover. Stockpilers were still eager to unload large quantities of spot goods, believing that once the low-priced rice arrives, the market for non-low-priced rice will inevitably become sluggish, and the market price will inevitably continue to fall. Therefore, yesterday's market price continued to decline by seven or eight yuan per picul compared with the previous market. However, in the afternoon, it was unexpectedly pushed up by the black market by three or four yuan per picul. Small-grain rice fell to 115 yuan, only five yuan away from the Hong Kong rice price.

Government Rice for Sale May Be Even Cheaper

According to Mr. Nipo, manager of Jardine Matheson & Co., which is responsible for selling Hong Kong rice, this morning, the sale of the first batch of Hong Kong rice is very satisfactory. Subsequent batches of Hong Kong rice will continue to be shipped by British ships, and it is expected that 25,000 tons of Hong Kong rice can be shipped to Shanghai every month. It is also reported that the preparations for the French Concession authorities to purchase Saigon rice have been completed. The quantity of Saigon rice transported is equal to that of the Hong Kong rice transported by the Municipal Council. It is said that the authorities of the two concessions will cooperate closely to carry out this matter, and the first batch of Saigon rice purchased by the French authorities will arrive within a week and be sold at a price slightly over 100 yuan and within 110 yuan. The selling price of the first batch of Hong Kong rice is 110 yuan.

Yesterday Afternoon, Black Market Drove Up Prices

Regarding the afternoon grain trade at the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Exchange at 15 Avenue Edward VII, the concession authorities have repeatedly ordered the various rice trade associations to find ways to strictly prohibit it. The Bean and Rice Miscellaneous Grain Trade Associations have also separately announced to the market that it is strictly prohibited. However, because these people's nature is difficult to change, they intend to continue to privately trade grain in that market every afternoon, secretly driving up prices for profit, which has a significant impact on the entire rice market. Although the French Concession authorities have also ordered personnel to be stationed in the market to monitor illegal activities, these people continue to use old tricks. Yesterday afternoon, they unexpectedly raised prices by three or four yuan, which is extremely illegal. The Rice Trade Association cannot shirk its responsibility. It is hoped that the authorities will severely crack down on it.

Uniform Style for Rice Shop Labels

The Rice Shop Trade Association issued a public notice to the rice market yesterday, stating: "This is a notice. Regarding the matter of rice shops in the two concessions hanging rice price signs and rice box labels, this association has agreed with the French Concession authorities on the style of the rice price signs for the convenience of the trade. The association has handed them over to the signboard shop for production. The Chinese and French names are listed in parallel on the signs. Once they are made, they will be distributed to the rice shops of all members for application. The required sign funds will be paid by the association in advance. The sign price is seven yuan in national currency per piece, and the association will send personnel to collect the money from each shop. Please pay accordingly. If you wait and see and do not pay, the association will not do it for you anymore. If you are punished in the future for not having signs to hang, you will be responsible for your own mistakes, and the association cannot help you."

Strictly Prohibit Re-export and Smuggling

According to general opinion, since the Municipal Council is determined to help the people's food supply, before it can handle the distribution of grain by household, it is best to set a limit on the purchase of rice. Because after the first batch of low-priced rice arrives in Shanghai, if the rich rush to buy it all, so that the poor people still suffer, it is not a way to universally benefit the common people. The public should also know that this low-priced rice is coming in steadily and is more than enough to meet the needs of the people in this port, so there is no need to pre-purchase and store it. However, the evil hands of unscrupulous merchants must also be guarded against, and the most important issue lies in the police authorities applying extremely strict measures to investigate and prohibit re-export sales. Otherwise, all efforts will be wasted and used by rice speculators.

Rice Cart Workers Request Work

The rice cart workers in this city, dissatisfied that the rice and grain of various rice shops is transported by trucks, which has put the livelihoods of thousands of workers in a desperate situation, have repeatedly sent letters to the Rice Shop Association, ordering all members to restore the pre-war state. All matters relating to the loading and unloading of rice and grain should be assigned to cart transport to maintain livelihoods and avoid causing other changes. However, the Rice Shop Association has not expressed any opinion on this request. Therefore, the workers specially sent representatives Wang Fuyuan, Liu Zongming, Su Chunxi, Su Mingyuan, Li Fengshan, Jiang Qiwen, Bao Huisheng, and Xin Faming and more than ten other people to the Municipal Council yesterday to petition. They were received by Mr. Gao, a detective from the Political Department. The workers immediately stated the purpose of the petition, requesting an order that the rice trade at least hand over 40% of the rice and grain to workers for transport, so as to maintain their livelihoods. Detective Gao promised to mediate immediately to prevent the situation from escalating and advised the workers to wait patiently for the authorities to deal with it legally and not to act without authorization.

### New U.S. Ambassador to China, Gauss, Arrives in Shanghai Next Week; U.S. Groups Scheduled to Hold Reception; Colonel Baker Gave Farewell Banquets by Various Parties

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, Gauss, will arrive in Shanghai early next week after departing from the United States on the President Garfield. The American Bridge Federation and the American Chamber of Commerce in this port will hold a joint reception to welcome the new ambassador. According to the notices recently issued by the two American groups, the reception will be held on Wednesday or Thursday evening. The exact date will depend on the date of the President Garfield's arrival in Shanghai. The reception will be held at the Columbia Country Club from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Attendance is limited to Americans. It was also announced that the American Bridge Federation and the American Chamber of Commerce will jointly host a farewell banquet for Colonel Baker, commander of the 4th Marine Regiment of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai, starting at 8:00 PM on the 10th of this month at the American Club. Attendance is also limited to Americans.

### Laundry and Dyeing Industry Resumes Work First; Business Associates Transferred; Negotiations Unfinished, Implementation Postponed

More than 3,000 laundry and ironing workers in the Western-style laundry and dyeing industry went on strike. They made a verbal request to the capital side on the 18th of last month to increase wages and scheduled negotiations for the 6th of this month. Unexpectedly, the labor side suddenly implemented a strike on the 4th of this month. Two days later (i.e., the 6th), they submitted a written request of 13 articles to the capital side. The capital side only agreed to increase wages by 30%. As a result, the rice was not resolved. Recently, the labor side felt all the pain during the strike, so it accepted the advice of the capital side the night before last and resumed work in all of the city's more than 1,000 laundry and dyeing shops yesterday morning. The labor and capital sides have scheduled their first round of negotiations for 2:00 PM today.

Business Negotiations Three Times

The labor-capital dispute at the Commercial Press has lasted for more than ten days. Previously, Assistant Manager Li Bojia made a special trip to Shanghai to mediate the dispute. Although he had talked twice, no results were achieved because the opinions were not close. It is said that the capital side convened a board meeting again yesterday. As of press time, it was not yet finished. The third conversation may take place within a day or two. The factory's delegation of associates is preparing everything and is determined to seek a reasonable solution based on consistent principles. It is hoped that all associates will wait patiently for news and not disturb themselves. It is reported that the company is notifying people to take a detour through Hong Kong to the mainland. The delegation is writing to notify all transferred associates to postpone their departure until the negotiations in Shanghai are resolved.

Two Cotton Mills Resume Work

The employees of the Jinglun Weaving Factory and the Gonghe Cotton Mill demanded wage increases and rice allowances from the capital side due to the rising price of rice. Due to disagreement on the conditions, a labor strike was triggered. The Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Union Federation, together with the Political Department of the Municipal Council, have persuaded both labor and capital to establish a reconciliation contract. All workers have resumed work yesterday morning.

Color Printing Industry Went on Strike Yesterday

The color printing industry in this city unfortunately went on strike yesterday. The labor side has now decided to abide by the resolutions of the industry union, strictly maintain order, and wait quietly for a resolution. The capital side has not yet made any statement. The labor side's request for improved treatment is still under review.

### Post Office Recruits Messengers; Physical Examinations Completed

The physical examinations for the messengers publicly recruited by the Shanghai Postal Administration have been completed on the 4th of this month. It is learned that the results of this examination show that more than half of the applicants were eliminated. (According to the bureau, a total of more than 4,300 application letters were received.) Only more than 1,800 applicants were passed. A written test is scheduled for the 15th of this month, and then a bicycle test and oral test will be held on a regular basis. It is reported that the number of people admitted this time is only between 150 and 200.

### Passengers with Passports Can Enter Hong Kong Without a Visa

After the Hong Kong Government Immigration Department began implementing the import restriction regulations on January 14 this year, Chinese citizens traveling to Hong Kong must first obtain an entry or transit permit issued by the department. Holders of Chinese government passports must also apply for a visa from the British consulates in various places before they are allowed to land. Now, after repeated negotiations between the diplomatic authorities and the British side, visas can be waived. The Shanghai China Release Company has received a telegram from the Hong Kong Government Immigration Department. From now on, Chinese citizens traveling to Hong Kong with Chinese government passports can be exempted from applying for visas from British consulates in various places. However, passengers who do not have a government passport and wish to go to Hong Kong must still follow the regulations of the Immigration Department.

European Jewish Refugees Fleeing to Shanghai Eagerly Hope to Go to the United States to Make a Living; All Greatly Alarmed Because the United States Is About to Enter the War; U.S. Consulate States that There Are No Restrictions

The Continental Daily reported that about 12,000 Jewish refugees who fled from all parts of Europe to Shanghai, hoping to go to the United States to make a living, were greatly alarmed after hearing the fierce speech made by U.S. Secretary of the Army Stimson a few days ago. They feared that the United States would soon enter the war, so that they could not go to the United States. According to news from the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai, about 5,000 Jewish refugees have applied for permission to enter the United States and are waiting for a reply. Many of them have been rejected and have reapplied. Thousands of others are currently raising the necessary cash and documents to formally apply. Now, because the situation in the United States is becoming increasingly tense, they have raised the question: "If the United States enters the war, can we apply to enter the United States?" Regarding this point, U.S. Consul Baker explained that the United States has no law prohibiting immigrants from entering the country during wartime. In addition, it must be decided by the instructions of the U.S. government. The U.S. Consulate is still accepting such applications, but whether applicants can buy a boat to reach the United States will depend on the state of shipping in the Pacific. On the other hand, the United States may tighten the necessary conditions for immigrants to enter the country in order to restrict them.

### Spring Grand Champagne First Prize Won by HSBC Employee; Portuguese Machado Becomes a Millionaire; Winning Horse Owned by HSBC Manager

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that Hindhead, the winning horse in the Spring Grand Champagne Race held at the Racecourse on the 7th of this month, was owned by Mr. Henchman, the manager of HSBC Bank, and the winner of the first prize in the champagne ticket was also a Portuguese employee of the bank, Machado (age 34). It can be said that HSBC Bank has

Double Happiness at the Door

The reporter tried to interview Mr. Machado this morning (9th), but an HSBC employee replied that "Mr. Machado has already left the bank." Other employees also tried their best to prevent reporters from meeting Mr. Machado. The reporter even called to talk to Mr. Machado, but to no avail. However, this morning someone witnessed Mr. Machado in the middle of the bank, working at his desk,

Very Happy

It is not yet certain whether Mr. Machado will continue to work at the bank after winning a huge prize of 196,000 yuan. Employees said that Mr. Machado had not yet announced his plans. It is said that Mr. Machado was extremely excited when he learned that he had won the prize yesterday (8th). The manager allowed him to take a leave of absence to return home, but Mr. Machado was willing to stay at the bank to continue working, which was heard by other employees,

Congratulations

A Chinese employee of Feng Bank also held one of the winning champagne tickets of Mr. Machado, and could share about 17,000 yuan. It is said that when the Chinese employee and Mr. Machado bought the tickets, the ticket seller only had two whole sheets left. Both of them wanted to buy them all. Then they negotiated a

Compromise

Each bought a whole sheet, and exchanged one of the strips with each other. Therefore, when Mr. Machado won the prize, the Chinese employee also shared one-eleventh of the prize money. It is said that Mr. Machado has worked at HSBC Bank for 15 years.

### Fire Continues at Ronghua Lane, Malong Road; Bodies Separately Coffined; Heavy Losses to Various Factories

The Xiesheng Silk Weaving Factory at No. 13 Ronghua Lane, No. 635 Malong Road (near the intersection of Xujiahui Road) in the French Concession, at 5:45 AM on the 7th, when the day and night shift workers were changing shifts, was caused by the day shift workers being careless when cooking snacks, leaving a fire to burn the wooden boards, which quickly became uncontrollable. In an instant, it broke through the roof, causing seven buildings from No. 11 to No. 17 to be completely destroyed. Ge Shiqi, the owner of the Qicheng Silk Weaving Factory at No. 11, his wife Zhou, his concubine Zhao, his son Mingzhong, the female worker Hu Fengying, and Li Lu, the wife of the owner of the Xiesheng Factory, the male worker Zhang Xianglin, and the female worker Zhang Guiying, and other men, women, and children, a total of eight people, failed to escape and were buried in the fire. The firefighters dug out the bodies, all of which were charred like charcoal, with broken limbs and arms, a miserable sight. The various news reports have already reported them. Yesterday, each family member carefully identified them based on the characteristics of the deceased before their death, such as teeth, head, and figure. Except for the bodies of the male and female workers Zhang Xianglin and Lu Guiying, which were coffined at the coroner's office and temporarily placed in the Shantang Cemetery, the other six bodies of men, women, and children were sent by their families to the Huxi Gongping Funeral Home for coffining. It is said that the losses of the various factories that were destroyed were quite heavy. Although they all had fire insurance, the issues of the amount insured and compensation are still being investigated and negotiated in detail.

### Robbery on Tongzhou Road, Hongkou

Yesterday, a chartered car No. 白 會一七六九 (White Society 1769) was driving past the end of Tongzhou Road, Hongkou at 0:30 PM when suddenly seven bandits jumped out of the roadside, blocked the road with guns, and threatened the driver to get out of the car. Then the seven bandits swarmed up and one of the bandits drove away, fleeing towards the Chinese territory without a trace. Afterwards, the driver reported the incident to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, requesting an investigation into the lost car. However, after the car was robbed, there were no reports of any incidents in the concession. It is difficult to guess what the bandits' purpose in robbing the car was.

### Embezzled Over 10,000 Yuan of Funds, Squandered All in Gambling Dens; Ge Songmao Detained for Investigation

Ge Songmao, a native of Ningbo, 34 years old, lived at No. 16 Wenyuanfang, Mintini Yin Road. He was an employee of Xinda Miscellaneous Grain Store at No. 122 Guangdong Road. Recently, Ge was ordered to go to Hangzhou to collect accounts. In Hangzhou, on March 11, Ge collected 10,007 yuan, 1 jiao and 4 fen from Xintai and Yongtai. At that time, after using 100 to 200 yuan, Ge returned to Shanghai on April 26. Because he had already spent a small amount, he could not pay it all. He had the whimsical idea of taking the collected money and gambling at the Six Nations Hotel, hoping to make up for the shortfall in one bet. Unexpectedly, not only did he fail to make up for it, but he squandered all the money in the account. Ge then wrote to Manager Yang Cunxiong, explaining the matter and requesting permission to repay it in installments. Yang reported it to the General Patrol Room, which, after investigation by Hua Ze Mao Yunlong, arrested Ge. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi explained the case and requested permission for a rescheduled hearing. Under questioning by Judge Feng, Ge admitted to embezzling and gambling, and he was ordered to be detained for another hearing.

### Hongkou Huisi Police Station Busts Gambling Den

Huisi Police Station Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, Deputy Detective Huang Fusen, and Chinese Detective Li Fengyong learned yesterday that someone at the Huning Hotel at No. 329 Kenenhai Road was asking for a room to open a gambling den, with a large scale of winning and losing. At 3:30 PM yesterday, they rushed to the address and surrounded the hotel. They then seized the gambling den in Room 37, seized Pai Gow tiles and gambling equipment of various sizes, and arrested the local gangster from Anhui, Bi Cai (33 years old), who harbored the gambling den, as well as the boss Ye Zhenhai (23 years old) from Anhui, and 13 gamblers on the spot, and brought them back to the police station for questioning.

### Poor and Pain-Stricken, Committed Suicide by Falling Downstairs

Wang Songdao, a native of Ningbo, 41 years old, who lived at No. 105 Yongping Lane, No. 90 Maignan Road in the Public Concession, used to work at the Postal Administration on North Sichuan Road. Two months ago, Wang fell ill and was receiving medical treatment at home. He has not yet recovered, which has led to medical expenses and a high debt. Everything was pawned, and he was extremely embarrassed. He complained about his fate and suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. Suddenly, at 10:45 AM yesterday, he jumped out of the bedroom window and fell to the ground, his brains bursting and died on the spot. His roommate discovered and reported it to the police to summon an ambulance, which was first sent to Baolong Hospital and then to the coroner's office to be examined.

### Large Batch of Cigarettes From Yizhong Tobacco Company Was Cheated; Tiger Cart Unknown Whereabouts

On the 24th of last month, the Yizhong Tobacco Company in this port hired a tiger cart from Lu Haihong (24 years old) of Nantong because it needed to transport a large batch of cigarettes. He drove the cart to the company's warehouse on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession and loaded three boxes of Front Door brand, ten boxes of Three Fortresses brand, and six boxes of Ambassador brand, instructing him to send them to Yongtaihe Tobacco Company on Jiujiang Road. Unexpectedly, Lu acted with malicious intent, took the truck away, and disappeared without a trace. After the company searched everywhere, but could not find him, it reported it to the police stations of the two concessions, requesting his arrest.

### Letter

To the Editor: I recently read the news "Old Clerk of the Zhanbao Customs Firm Secretly Steals Warehouse Receipts" in the Eighth Edition of the Second Sheet of the Shenbao on the 8th of this month, which stated, "Entrusted to the Tongfa Gong Customs Firm at No. 78 Tianzhutang Street, French Concession, to be stored at the Seventh Warehouse of British Merchant Ping Zhiming on Ningbo Road," etc. This is not true. The Qianxiangyi Cloth Store in Shenzhuang initially planned to deposit 50 pieces of cloth in our warehouse. Because there was no spare space, we refused to store them. Later, the cloth store privately entrusted Hu Guibao, an old clerk in our firm, to deposit them in the Ping Zhiming warehouse. It was a private transaction and has nothing to do with our firm. Fearing that the outside world would misunderstand, we hereby request you to correct it in order to clarify the facts and avoid misunderstanding. We are extremely grateful. Sincerely, Yu Ji of Tongfa Gong, May 8, 30th year, to the Shenbao Newspaper Office Local News Editorial Department. The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: "The weather around Shandong is clear, with a shift to gentle northerly winds. Here, the sky is overcast, with showers or fog, but the day will gradually clear up, with gentle northerly to easterly winds. There are northeasterly to southeasterly winds along the coast south of Ma'an Island." Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 68.5 and the lowest was 64.3. On the same day last year, the highest was 70.5 and the lowest was 60.6.

Commercial News

### Grain: Adjusting the People's Food Supply Relies on Real Strength. Rice Prices Gradually Approach Fixed Prices. The Municipal Council's Fixed-Price Rice Arrives Imminently, Reassuring the People. Rice Weevils Attempt a Final Struggle, Ultimately Failing. Extreme Price Fluctuations, Never Before Seen.

Regulating the people's food supply requires real strength and cannot be achieved with empty words. Therefore, the Municipal Council repeatedly set price limits, which not only failed to restrain rice prices but also encouraged unscrupulous merchants to hoard and increase prices. This is because the rice weevils dared to disregard the Municipal Council, knowing that the Council could do nothing to them. However, now it is different. The authorities of both concessions are well aware that condoning hoarding is harmful to themselves and nurturing laziness is a source of future trouble. Therefore, they resolutely and decisively made thorough arrangements without making a sound. When the announcement was made, rice merchants openly resisted in front, and hoarders secretly sabotaged behind, still thinking of making a final struggle. The authorities of both concessions remained unmoved and kept the food of millions of people in mind, which is greatly appreciated by the world. However, the rice weevils, unwilling to give up, took the opportunity to resist, hoping to undermine the Municipal Council's good policies. They are likely to move restlessly. Fortunately, in addition to unblocking sources, the Municipal Council is also paying attention to how to preserve surplus grain, how to control the sale of stored grain within the concession, and how to prevent rice merchants from taking advantage of the situation and carrying out their cunning schemes. This is what the general public hopes the concession authorities can do to take further action to prevent any eventuality.

The price of foreign rice fell sharply on the market yesterday. Both spot and futures prices saw a significant drop of about ten to thirteen yuan. The public was as panicked as during the recent surge. The surge and fall in the market were driven entirely by speculators betting long or short, the so-called "hat grabbers" and "ball kickers." As soon as prices fell, these speculators rushed to get out even faster than others. Some who had rushed to buy at low prices in the previous two days now could not make margin calls as prices fell again, so they had to cut their losses. As for the large, powerful players, their purchase prices were lower than those of the average speculator. Although prices had fallen by more than thirty yuan, they still had profits in hand and were still hoping for a miracle. A few outside players were also wavering and dared not store for long. The market continued to fall sharply, almost out of control. Small Line opened at 121 yuan, then 120 yuan, 119 yuan, 118 yuan, down to 115 yuan, and once as low as 112.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon fell to 125 yuan, No. 2 to 116 yuan, and broken rice to 90 yuan, all down by eight, nine, or ten yuan from the previous day. The original Yingshi bag (one picul and two pecks) of No. 1 April/May fell from 145 yuan and 146 yuan to 110 yuan, and broken rice to 111 yuan and 109 yuan. No. 1 Saigon fell by 13.5 yuan from the previous day, and broken rice also fell by about ten yuan. However, the price drop attracted real sales from the mainland, and local merchants also dragged in some goods, so the market recovered by one or two yuan at noon, and another one or two yuan in the afternoon. At closing, No. 1 Saigon was quoted at 126 yuan, No. 2 at 116-117 yuan, No. 1 at 126 yuan, Huojiao at 116-117 yuan, Dang at 117 yuan, Haiphong at 117 yuan, Xiaojiao at 115 yuan, Tokyo Jian at 109 yuan, Special at 113 yuan, and broken Jian at 92 yuan.

The demand for japonica and glutinous rice was not strong. Faced with the sharp fall in foreign rice, business effectively stopped. As a result, except for two or three truckloads of early and late rice from Nangang, which opened at 130 yuan, down another five or six yuan from before, there were no transactions for other types of rice such as thick japonica and glutinous rice tea.

More foreign rice arrived at the port. The Taikoo Company's Shandong ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 15,001 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It berthed at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that the first batch of about 22,500 bags of Yangon Xiaojiao rice purchased by the Municipal Council and shipped from Hong Kong will arrive tomorrow. Ordinary people will be able to buy cheap rice next Monday. (Zu)

### Another 80,000 to 90,000 Bags of Kan Flour Arrive. The Flour Market Heads Straight Downstream.

Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market situation took a sharp turn for the worse. This was mainly due to the impact of the sharp fall in rice prices in recent days and the new arrival of 80,000 to 90,000 bags of Kan flour. People's morale was exhausted, and local customers and real sellers were all watching. Many speculative hoarders were unable to hold on and were seeking to sell. Therefore, the market headed straight downstream. Tongjin sold five or six thousand bags of Blooming Bird brand Australian flour and Golden Dragon brand Kan flour. Golden Dragon flour was 21.2 to 31 yuan, and Blooming Bird flour was 31.5 yuan, continuing to fall by more than one yuan. However, the market seemed to stabilize due to rumors of a blockade in Hong Kong. The future of the market is still in turmoil.

Wheat: Yesterday, the market situation was as quiet as before. With the old wheat being phased out, all flour mills have stopped buying raw materials and are waiting for the new wheat to come on the market before resuming purchases. Currently, Gao Du wheat is still priced at 47 or 48 yuan, but there are no formal transactions.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Oilcake and Miscellaneous Grains Rebound Sharply in the Afternoon.

Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and sesame oilcake was weak and unable to recover, as people's morale was affected by the continued weakness of the rice market. As a result, soybean oil had fallen by five yuan, corn by two yuan, and soybean cake by seven or eight jiao at the close of the morning session. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still bleak and lifeless. However, later, driven by rumors in the rice market, it rose rapidly, and the market for miscellaneous grains and oilcake also rose accordingly. As a result, soybean oil recovered by one yuan, corn by 1.3 or 1.4 jiao, and soybean cake exceeded the previous day's price. A total of more than 30,000 pieces of Shengji futures oilcake were traded. 400 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 100 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil, 2,000 bags of spot corn, and 100 tons of futures were traded.

### Finance: U.S. Dollar Dumping Intensifies.

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: the HSBC exchange rates remained flat, while the informal market for British and American exchange rates eased further. Negative rumors abounded, saying that gold prices would fall even more sharply. Chinese speculators took out U.S. dollars for May and shorted June futures. British and American banks had little appetite, causing the U.S. dollar to rise from 5.28125 yuan in the morning to 5.375 yuan. The British pound also fell to 3 shillings and 2.8125 pence. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants continued to short sell, and the Bank of Japan also dumped U.S. dollars. Gold prices fell to around 6,400 yuan. Chinese banks even sold hard at 5.40625 yuan for spot U.S. dollars, and 5.375 yuan for forward settlement. Finally, as the amount of gold bars shorted was exhausted, the trend reversed and softened, closing at 5.34375 yuan, up 0.06825 yuan. The British pound closed at 3 shillings and 2.65625 pence, up 0.015625 pence. The day's trading was extremely active.

Most Futures Contracts Cashed out for May and June.

Since the foreign exchange and silver markets in the morning, Britain, America, and India have not changed. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against Shanghai alone rose by five points, while the rest remained unchanged. The bank's selling price opened early in the domestic market: spot British exchange rate was 3 shillings and 2.5 pence, and the U.S. dollar was 5.28125 yuan. After the opening, in the speculative selling trend, the U.S. dollar for next month's futures was difficult to sell at 5.3125 yuan, with a slight easing. British and American banks had a slight interest. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. After the silver balance tax was still levied at 24.50%, the U.S. dollar for this month softened to 5.28125 yuan, which was difficult to settle and sell. However, soon the speculative selling trend started again, and it was sold hard in June. Furthermore, because the price of gold was falling, it was pressed down too much, and the May contracts were cashed out. The U.S. dollar rose from 5.28125 yuan to 5.34375 yuan, which was absorbed by foreign banks, HSBC, and a certain American bank. In the afternoon, it rose again to 5.34375 yuan, which could be settled. The British pound eased to 3 shillings and 2.8125 pence.

Foreign Merchants Buy Low and Hold Steady.

In the afternoon, the Japanese Bank also came to dump, and speculators cashed out, with the U.S. dollar price for the June contract at 5.375 yuan. At that time, the Chinese bank sold the spot U.S. dollar to HSBC at 5.40625 yuan, which was the loosest. However, soon the foreign banks saw that the cheap absorption was even better, and it was heard that the gold price was reversing upward, and the selling trend stopped immediately, and the U.S. dollar softened back to 5.3125 yuan. The British pound also tightened slightly. The market closed at 4 o'clock, with spot and June futures both at British exchange rate of 3 shillings and 2.65625 pence, both fixed at 0.015625 pence, U.S. dollar at 5.34375 yuan, long 0.0625 yuan, and also close to 5.3125 yuan this month.

Hong Kong U.S. Dollar Eases, Shanghai Dollar also Drops.

Hong Kong, 9th (Friday) Telegram: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The British, American, and Japanese exchange rates remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot fell by 7.5 cents, to 460 yuan and 1.5 cents (the closing price yesterday was 461 yuan). It was steady at 9:40. The U.S. dollar for spot eased 0.0625, to 24.375 yuan. The Chinese exchange rate for spot rose by 7.5 cents, to 461 yuan. The market was steady at 10:30.

### Rapid Retreat and Sharp Advance: The Gold Tide is Frightening.

There was a range of 193 yuan in one day. Spot Gold soared and had to be marked up by more than ten yuan. Yesterday's gold market was chaotic in the unofficial market, and the storm was increasingly dangerous. It first fell and then rose sharply, and the changes were very unexpected. After the 6,400 yuan mark was broken, it was seen to come back, and all parties were unanimously downward. In fact, all kinds of rumors were far from the facts. Foreign exchange was sharply loose under speculative selling, so the gold price began to drop to 6,573 yuan through the exchange dealers, and soon in the negative rumor, the securities companies turned to buy and dump it, and in the tragic selling of Xinyuan and Yuhao Qianzhuang silver houses, the midday was retreated to the 6,400 yuan mark. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange was looser, and the number of sellers in the market increased. The scattered short sellers pressed down sharply, and then the low price of 6,380 yuan was seen, and the decline was too sharp. Foreign exchange could not keep up with the loosening, and the settlement price was pressed down by 100 yuan. The exchange dealers were more eager to buy in, so after 2:30, the chips suddenly felt short, and the cash rose, and the foreign exchange was absorbed by foreign banks to stop the loosening and suddenly returned. The securities help and silver houses and scattered households tended to make up for the gain, and then rose by 128 yuan to reach 6,508 yuan, and finally failed to support the fall. The closing continued to squeeze a small 67 yuan, and then fell to 6,470 yuan after the close. The market was chaotic and never stopped all day. The total transaction volume was about 890,000 taels. Cash first fell and then rose. Yongfengyu issued 50 taels, and the price was 170 yuan higher than the futures. Chengfei issued 50 taels, 125 yuan higher, and all were bought by silver buildings. In the afternoon, it suddenly rose sharply, and the silver building gang absorbed it, and then entered Shunyuan 50 taels, and Chengji 20 taels, which was 250 yuan higher than the futures, and had to be squeezed up by more than ten yuan from the previous day. The price of jewelry gold was also lowered to 680 yuan, and then it was lowered to 695 yuan, and Guanjin and others were flat.

Chaotic to the Extreme

Since the morning (10 taels per bar), the market opened at 9:15 at 6,550 yuan, 2 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. After the opening, people's hearts were very empty. It was heard that the US dollar had hardened again to 5.3125 yuan, so under the selling pressure of Yiyuan and scattered households, it retreated sharply to 6,530 yuan. Before long, the foreign exchange softened, and it was difficult to settle at 5.28125 yuan. Xinfengyong, Tongkangyong, Dafeng, Yida, and Hengji made strong gains, and the scattered shorts made up the gains sharply, and the price rose by more than 40 yuan to 6,573 yuan, and was sold hard by Xinyuan and Shunyuan, pressing down to around 6,520 yuan. At 11:25, the loosening trend of foreign exchange suddenly became sharp, and Tongkangyong, Yida, and Dafeng also came to reissue. When He and Hengji also sold, the falling wind was suddenly strong, breaking into 6,500 yuan, and the cut was even more tragic, and it fell by another 100 yuan, losing to the 6,400 yuan mark, and was bought by Chengji, Tianyuan, and Xin. Yong bought in, and rebounded by 30 yuan. The noon closed at 6,430 yuan, and after the closing, it was 6,435 yuan. The market opened at 6,440 yuan at 2:00 pm, with a premium of 10 yuan, and Dafeng and Xinfengyong came to cash in, soaring to 6,470 yuan. Suddenly it was heard that it was also difficult to sell and settle at 5.375 yuan for the US dollar. Chida, Hengji Yutaifeng, Shihe scattered households and others dumped and pressed down hard, and the price fell again by 90 yuan, and the parties were inclined to cut, breaking into 6,400 yuan, and the low price of 6,380 yuan was seen. Not long after, a rebound rebounded, both because of the huge amount of exchange dealer cash in, the lack of chips, and the foreign exchange stopped loosening and suddenly returned. Those who profited made up for the gains, creating a squeeze. Hengji, Yida, Tianyuan, Yili, Dafeng, and Xinfengyong made strong gains, so they soared by more than 120 yuan again, and leaped out of the 6,400 and 500 yuan marks one after another, rising to 6,508 yuan, and was then suppressed by the sellers and retreated again. The market closed at 6,485 yuan at 4:00, 67 yuan smaller than the previous day. It was found that it had fallen for two days, and the total was 165 yuan smaller. According to the settlement price of the May US dollar at 5.34375 yuan, it was 6,517 yuan, with a pressure of 32 yuan. After the market closed, it fell to 6,470 yuan under the selling pressure. There was a range of 193 yuan in the whole day, and the selling price of the original brand gold of the cash store was 260 yuan higher than the hot red futures price, and the purchase price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There is no price and no market for the current bid gold.

Jewelry Gold Changed Six Times.

The price of silver jewelry per tael, Datongxing and Xinxingxing both dropped by 5 yuan at 10:00 am, to 690 yuan, and then dropped by another 5 yuan at 12:00, and then dropped by 5 yuan again at 2:30 pm, to 680 yuan. At 3:00, it rebounded by 5 yuan, and at 3:30, it was increased by 5 yuan, and at 4:00, it rose by another 5 yuan, still at 695 yuan, flattened, and the purchase was reduced by 40 yuan, etc.

### Securities: Category D Prices Fall the Most, Other Stocks See Little Excitement.

The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday saw almost no one interested. Since the United States planned to implement escorting, gold and cotton yarn have undergone huge changes. Speculators abandoned public bonds and flocked to the hot red and cotton yarn markets. The public bond market was extremely deserted. Occasional transactions often could not find a counterparty. In terms of its trend, it should slightly decline during this kind of dangerous and unsettling time, but it has not caused widespread panic. Since the longs are unwilling to sell cheaply and the shorts have no way to make up for the losses, Category A has not been traded all day due to excessive restraint. The market is also only about one jiao lower due to too few transactions. Category D is holding its 11th lottery today, and the market yesterday afternoon was reduced by the integrated calculation, and the price alone was 7.5 jiao lower. There is nothing much to describe between the buying and selling parties. The number of transactions was only about 600,000 yuan on paper all day. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 50 shares of Zhonghua Book Company were traded at a price of 48 yuan.

In addition, the stock market of the Public Association opened the same as the previous close. After a while, the selling wind started again, and prices fell tragically again. The closing trend was quite unstable. There was a lack of rubber stock traders, and the price softness was even greater than that of industrial stocks.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Bulls' Lines Shake, Selling Wind Suddenly Rises, Double Horse Advances by 500 Yuan.

The yarn market continued to decline, and the falling wind was violent. This was because foreign exchange was lengthening and the bid gold was falling. Therefore, the bull lines shook, and at the same time, the actual sales turned dull, which made people uneasy. The shorts rose sharply, and the 20-count double horse broke through the 500 yuan mark. The highest price was 1,541 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,467 yuan. At the beginning of the afternoon, the floating longs uniformly closed due to panic, and the price fell another 10 yuan to 1,466 yuan. However, some shorts made up for the losses, and rebounded to 1,484 yuan. Later, the gold price fell back, and a certain firm threw out 1,000 bales at the market price, plunging to 1,455 yuan. The shorts came to pick up again, and saw 1,496 yuan again. The final price was 1,484.5 yuan. It can be imagined how crazy the general speculators were.

The double horse's morning opening momentum was still flat. The first opening price was 1,536 yuan, slightly down to 534 yuan. At this time, the desk was still stable, and it rose to 1,541 yuan, with the bid gold rebounding slightly. After a long time, it was heard that the gold price was falling, and there were many rumors, and the selling wind suddenly rose in the market, and the market gradually declined, to the 1,500 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, near 12 o'clock, it was said that foreign exchange was soaring, and the market fell sharply, and the straight line fell to 1,466 yuan, and people were extremely panicked. The grazing market slightly recovered to 1,476 yuan. Statistics show that 9,730 bales were traded in half a day. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.

Hong Kong 130 Fellow Traders 960

Statistics: 9,730

### Spot Cotton Transactions Stop.

The spot cotton situation fell along with the yarn market. At the same time, the factory's acceptance of goods was blocked, foreign exchange was lengthened, and the bid gold fell, causing people to be weak. Raw cotton was also fatigued a lot, and transactions had invisibly stopped. Another message, the foreign cotton transaction of foreign firms in Shanghai, was relatively flat. This was because the yarn market fell sharply, foreign exchange was lengthened, and at the same time, the people were not without panic because the European war was about to expand. Therefore, yesterday, except for a few small batches of Brazilian cotton traded by the same industry, the rest was not heard.

The New York cotton market first fell due to the selling by the Southern Gang, and then rebounded due to the purchase by the textile industry and the good cotton cloth trade. As a result, the closing price rose by about six or seven pounds from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was weak and the transaction was narrow. It fell at the beginning of the morning due to the closing of the long position, and then rose slightly due to the short position making up for the loss. As a result, the closing price fell by three or four rupees.

It is also predicted that the asking price market today will be higher by 0.25 rupees.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Prices Become One-Sided.

Yesterday, due to the sharp easing of foreign exchange, cotton yarn and cloth fell sharply, and scattered longs scrambled to sell out. Buyers watched with their hands tied, so cloth prices became one-sided. All cloth prices fell step by step. However, the market rebounded slightly later because the price fell too much, causing the same industry to absorb it cheaply. As a result, fine cloth and fine twill fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece, coarse cloth fell by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao, and the opening price of bleached and dyed cloth was chaotic. Generally, it also fell (per piece) 5 jiao. There were few transactions on this street, about 200 pieces. The buying of customers was temporarily suspended. The Cantonese and Hong Kong assistants bought 70 to 80 pieces of twill blue cloth, and the rest of the assistants also had scattered transactions.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Prices in Japan and the United States Rise Together.

The Yokohama silk market has been looking up since the beginning of the week, and has gradually risen by about 50 yuan so far. Yesterday's spot price was 1,550 yuan, and the forward price was 1,539 yuan. The New York silk market also rose. Export firms in the area had slightly sold yesterday, including Baichang Jing Erling-- Er Er Dian Qi Ba average at 6,125 yuan, Yihuo Dachang, etc., totaled more than 50 bales.

### Sugar Market: Early Coarse White Weak, Later Strong.

Yesterday, the sugar market had no market for the tenth-day coarse delivery in the morning, and only did the fifth-month twentieth-day coarse in the afternoon. The market price was weak at first and then rose later. As a result, there was not much up and down. The association's market, the fifth-month twentieth-day futures opened at a discount of 7 yuan, and then loosened to 6 and a half yuan, 6 yuan, 5 and 8 cents, and then turned strong, and then rose to 6 and a half yuan, 7 yuan, 7 and a half yuan, 8 yuan, and 8 and 2 cents, and there was a lack of market.

### Seafood: Tapioca Flour Stable.

The tapioca flour is still maintaining a stable situation in the midst of the loose and falling voices of miscellaneous grains. It is related to the real use, which is different from food. For example, the dyeing and weaving factory uses it as a slurry cloth, which is widely used, so it has little impact. The market price yesterday was 122 yuan for the first-class flour flying unicorn mark, 115 yuan for the KG mark, 103 yuan for the second-class flour double TA mark, 97 yuan for the TT mark, and 77 yuan for the third-class flour C mark.

The Chinese Christian Association for the Promotion of Filial Piety, Advocating Parent Education, and Increasing the Welfare of Parents, has initiated the designation of the second Sunday of May each year as Parents' Day, which has been unanimously supported by all walks of life, and is actively preparing. The educational relationship in the city also takes tomorrow as the day of the establishment of Parents' Day, which is a good opportunity for schools to train students to cultivate the virtue of filial piety. A "Celebration Method for the Establishment of Parents' Day in Schools at All Levels in Shanghai" has been formulated and circulated to all schools for compliance. This case will not be issued in another document. I would like to explore the original text as follows:

(1) Each school should have each teacher explain the meaning of the establishment of Parents' Day, and elaborate on the importance of the virtue of filial piety, and the historical facts of filial piety in China and foreign countries.

(2) Each primary school should hold a filial piety story speech meeting, and each middle school should hold a filial piety speech competition.

(3) Each school should require students to write a "Filial Piety Diary" on this day.

(4) Each school should instruct students to get up at 6:00 in the morning on this day and pay tribute to their parents.

(5) Each school should instruct students to save their pocket money on this day and buy gifts for their parents.

(6) Each school should instruct students to comfort the poor parents of relatives, friends and neighbors.

(7) Each school should, as far as possible, insert relevant filial piety teaching materials in each subject of teaching, and implement a central training week.

(8) Other measures shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Parents' Day Preparatory Committee.

### Special Education Committee of the Public Works Bureau - Publication of Report (3)

Basic Principles

Regarding the suggestions made by the Special Education Committee in 1937 concerning Western schools, including the following item: "The policy of the Public Works Bureau should tend towards the expansion of the subsidy method, the establishment of schools for foreign nationals of various countries, and the strict restriction of direct education facilities." This suggestion is in line with the resolution mentioned in the previous section and should be adopted. However, it is believed that it does not imply that education funds are ultimately or permanently limited to the currently approved amount.

System Changes

The various suggestions mentioned above do not advocate for the immediate implementation of any drastic changes to the current system. Regarding this level, the committee has decided as follows:

A. The principle adopted by the Public Works Bureau in 1934 that education funds should not exceed the income equivalent to 2% of taxes is no longer applicable. In fact, this limit has been exceeded and a new principle should be established to re-limit it.

B. The allocation of education funds from municipal revenue is quite unfair in terms of the benefits received by students of various nationalities.

Regarding the first issue, this committee advocates that the above-mentioned restriction method should be explicitly abolished, and sufficient funds should be temporarily allocated to maintain the education funds in the return trip. As for the subsidy method, it is proposed that the Standing Education Committee should decide on the increase in the amount of subsidies at any time. However, any increase method should be applied fairly to Chinese, Japanese, and Western schools. Regarding the second issue, this committee recommends that the fair use of all education funds should be recognized in principle, so that the benefits received by various foreign national groups are in line with the taxes they pay.

Before the economic situation allows the funds to exceed the minimum amount, it seems impossible to immediately correct the current inequality in a concrete way. However, as soon as the situation improves, funds should be added to gradually correct the current inequality in distribution, and the following principles should be adopted based on the actual number of maintenance costs of the Bureau-run schools:

A. Within the total education funds, the various expenses of the Department of Education, such as administrative fees, pensions, and other subsidies, should be deducted first.

B. The remaining amount after the deduction should be divided into three parts to match the ratio of taxes paid by Chinese, Japanese, and other foreign nationals.

C. In the first part, the expenses of the Bureau-run Chinese children's schools should be deducted, and the remaining amount should be allocated as subsidies for Chinese schools. The second part should be allocated as subsidies for Japanese schools. In the third part, the expenses of the Western children's schools should be deducted, and the remaining amount should be allocated to Western schools.

### Children are Innocent

— Pan Li

According to the results of research by British Dr. Manshin, the biggest cause of child crime is. But according to his observation, even if the phenomenon of poverty disappears, cases of child crime will continue to exist. This is not to say that we do not need to eliminate the phenomenon of poverty, nor is it to say that the elimination of the phenomenon of poverty is of no benefit in solving the problem of child crime, but that there are other factors besides poverty that promote child crime.

What is referred to here is the emotional problem. If children do not get their social and emotional needs met, the natural tendency will lead them down the path of crime. The act of crime has a compensating effect on their soul, and the act of crime invisibly gives them spiritual satisfaction.

So even if a child commits a crime, the child is often innocent.

Education

### I Don't Look Like a College Student

— Ying

I don't look like a college student at all, even though I'm going to graduate from college in a year.

Speaking of college students, everyone has such an impression: the man should be dressed in a suit and leather shoes, with a Western-style book under his arm, covered with Vaseline on his head, and walking with a creaking sound. What about the woman? She should have permed hair, long nails painted with nail polish, and "modern" clothes, as well as those very energetic high-heeled shoes. These are the "symbols" of college students. If you want to be a decent college student, you have to work hard in this direction first. Isn't it? Many of the classmates I know used to be completely "rustic", but since entering the gate of the university, their appearance has quickly changed. I often admire their "courage". After all, they are "advanced" women of the "new era".

Compared with them, I really tarnish the term "college student". Sometimes I take a careful look at myself, and I can't help but feel a little "ashamed". My hair is still the same short haircut as a primary school student; from spring to winter, the color of my clothes has never changed - it is always a blue cloth robe; speaking of shoes, it is even more shabby, not only no high-heeled leather shoes, but no flat-heeled leather shoes, all year round a pair of black cloth shoes. In fact, do I have anything worthy of being called a "college student"?

Because of my ugly appearance, I am often despised and ridiculed. When I carry a thick Western-style book to school, it seems that many people are laughing at me: "Does this kind of person look like a college student?" Sometimes I go to the bookstore to buy books, and I am often treated coldly by the shop assistants. When I say the name of the book I want to buy, they often look at me in surprise, as if I am not worthy of reading this kind of book. Not to mention that I often suffer embarrassing contempt outside, even in school, I am excluded from the group of classmates. Those beautiful female classmates seem to disdain being with me. Sometimes they are talking and laughing happily together. When I approach them, the talking and laughing will stop immediately, and they will give me a contemptuous look. They often laugh at me in secret, saying that I am an old antique left over from the eighteenth century.

I am becoming more and more lonely day by day. Except for books, it seems that no one sympathizes with me anymore. Many classmates who used to be as "honest" as me have been gradually influenced by this big city and become more and more beautiful. They said: "Those who know the times are heroes." People like me can only be outdated old antiques.

But sometimes I feel that I am not lonely. Aren't the "books" and "knowledge" that often teach and sympathize with me my most loyal friends? Every time I think of this, I often feel proud and happy. In terms of reading, I am obviously much stronger than them. Maybe it's because I love reading too much that I never thought that I should spend precious time on dressing up. If I have to spend two hours sitting in the barber shop getting electrocuted, why don't I sit in the library and read an interesting article? If I have to spend forty or fifty yuan to buy a pair of leather shoes, why don't I buy a favorite book with it? Many classmates' homes are full of novel clothes, but my property is a cabinet of old books. Sometimes I also ask myself such questions: "Should I replace these heavy books with beautiful clothes?" But so far I still have some heavy books and no beautiful clothes. Is it true that a beautiful soul is not as good as a beautiful appearance? I often think like this.

(7) Draw a cross on the face

"Third Uncle," he said to Yuan Baofan with an extremely sad and angry expression, word by word: "One has already been ruined by you. If you want to do something cruel to Third Aunt again, I would rather beg for food than recognize you as my uncle!"

"She...?" Yuan Baofan immediately smiled bitterly. "Where can I" do to her anymore! Just now you saw that I didn't scold her or beat her, I just brought that dead thing to confront her, and it has already made her want to die and not give up. Now we'll just pretend that nothing happened,..."

Before Lao Yuan could finish speaking, Governor Hu, as a peacemaker, patted Shaowen lightly on the shoulder and interjected, "Okay! Be generous, everyone don't mention the past!"

Shaowen gradually lowered his head and looked at his good friend who had sacrificed everything for love. He couldn't help but burst into tears like a tide.

"But I want to explain," this is what Lao Yuan said to his brother: "I must take her back to Beijing in the future. I can't stand this kind of thing anymore!"

As he spoke, he shrugged his shoulders and shrank his head and hands at the same time, making a completely turtle-like posture, which made Governor Hu laugh (102) (End of Section 7)

Invention

### Flying Car

— Li Yi

Mr. Taiton, an inventor from Ohio, USA, recently suggested mass-producing "flying cars." This kind of flying car is completely streamlined, resembling a mine, with three wheels underneath and wings on top that can be installed or removed freely. On land, it is a car. If the wings are installed, it becomes an airplane. There is a propeller behind the plane to promote its progress. This kind of flying car has been tested satisfactorily in the laboratory and is waiting for a formal test flight.

Science

### Fragrant World

— Xiu

Many useful things, such as raincoats, rubber, glue, and paint, have unpleasant odors. Now this shortcoming has been remedied. American perfumery chemists have in their treasure trove more than a thousand fragrant raw materials that can be used industrially. A company produced a scented powder called "Apple Vegetable Zao," and their advertisements were printed with ink containing this scented powder. As a result, their products were in short supply. The Chicago Tribune once issued a special page to celebrate the opening of the National Flower Show, which was printed with a bunch of roses and smelled like roses, just like real flowers. A fire insurance company printed a blotter as a promotional item, with the smell of a burned house on the paper, and its business doubled.

The smell of raincoats has been eliminated. A newly invented rainproof cloth emits a lovely fragrance when it is wet. Scented carbon paper, typewriter ribbons, and pencils invigorate office workers. A bus company and a railway company have switched to fragrant fuels instead of gasoline, etc., and passengers flock to them. The paint used to paint houses no longer has an unpleasant odor, so newly painted houses can be inhabited immediately without loss.

Last year, two Swiss chemists invited reporters to watch a groundbreaking scented film. A little girl was shown on the screen holding a bunch of violets, and the audience smelled the fragrance of violets. The two chemists said that this kind of film is not surprising. Modern air conditioning methods can produce or eliminate more than a thousand kinds of odors.

After further achievements are made in these inventions, it will not be difficult for this world to become a fragrant world.

### The Function of Laughter

— Vicissitudes

Dr. G.G. Walsh of Fordham Social College in New York, USA, once published a prescription saying: "Laughter can often cure many physical ailments."

Dr. Hua said in his lecture on the psychology of laughter: "In scientific terms, laughter is a kind of diaphragmatic movement of the human body, which has a massage effect on the five internal organs of the chest and abdomen." He believes that laughter is a natural tonic and is important for the human body, just as exercise is indispensable. He also said: "People are not only rational animals, but also animals that can laugh. This ability and qualification to laugh really make people suitable for survival."

### Parents' Day and Three Mothers Teach Son

— Junmei

The second Sunday in May (11th) is American Mother's Day. In order to expand the meaning of Mother's Day, the National Christian Church has designated this day as Parents' Day. Its purpose is: "to promote the virtue of filial piety", "to improve the welfare of parents", and "to promote parental education". This is the first year it will be held, and all sectors of the city have set celebration methods, which are carried out in three aspects: individuals, schools, and social organizations. Here, I feel that the Peking Opera Theater can also take advantage of this festival to do a little bit of the scene. In Peking Opera, there are many scripts about parents and children, such as "Mother Xu Scolds Cao" and "Mother Yue Tattoos Words on Back", which show the teaching and training of distinguishing between loyalty and treachery; "Farewell Mother, Random Arrows" and "Hua Mulan", which show devotion and filial piety and dedication to the country; "Four Lang Visits Mother", which shows the love between mother and son in times of chaos; "Visiting the Cold Kiln", which shows breaking the gap between the rich and the poor! As for "Mulian Saves Mother", "Tiying Saves Father", "Qingfeng Pavilion", "Searching for Orphans and Saving Orphans", "Baolian Lantern", etc., all contain the meaning of love between parents and children, and the play "Three Mothers Teach Son" is undoubtedly enough to criticize reality and become a good play for the festival.

Three Mothers Teach Son is a Qingyi Zheng Gong Opera. In recent years, only the stage where the actors teach their sons on the loom has been performed, resulting in a monotonous scene and a general decline into a cold play. Two years ago, Shang Xiaoyun and Wang Yurong in the former capital successively rehearsed the entire play, from Xue Guang's departure from home to the end of the Twin Official Decree, from beginning to end, in one go. The old play was newly turned over and was praised by the audience. According to Three Mothers Teach Son, it tells "the story of scholar Xue Guang, who traded in Zhenjiang, was said to have died. His wife Zhang and concubine Liu could not bear to keep the festival and remarried one after another. Only the third concubine Wang Chun'e swore to keep herself and worked hard with the old servant Xue Bao to support the family and raise Liu's abandoned son Yige as her own. When Yige went to school, he was ridiculed by his classmates as an "orphan", and he was angry and often read. The third mother saw him returning early and taught him herself. She broke the machine and reprimanded him, and Xue Bao also persuaded him from the side. Yige was enlightened and eventually became a great talent. Later, Xue Guang abandoned business and became an official outside. He asked for leave to return home. Yige passed the imperial examination and returned home in glory. The court praised him". Although the matter is full of feudal atmosphere, especially in this time of declining customs and indifference, it is especially enough to save the decadence and encourage the last customs to embellish Parents' Day.

### A Record of Zhang Yiyun's Art Affairs

— Sick Dove

Zhang Yiyun is a new character in Carlton. People only know that she is the younger sister of the famous Kunling Zhang Eyung, but outsiders do not know much about her art affairs. I have known the Zhang sisters for a long time. I have visited their residence and listened to her singing. In a certain hall, I was able to see her performance, and her drama skills have been glimpsed. Now I will tell the audience what I know.

Yiyun lived with her sister since she was a child. She was deeply influenced by what she saw and heard. She could sing at the age of ten. She was self-taught without a teacher and was more intelligent than ordinary children. Five years ago, Eyung began to formally teach her to sing, and Hu Tiefen explained the play for her. In less than a year, her art progressed rapidly, and with her sister's instructions, the progress was even faster. Last year, she also served as a teacher in Tongshan, adjusting the old and saying the new. She can now perform no less than forty plays. Cheng School plays such as "Golden Lock Record", "Scolding the Palace", "Yutang Spring", and "Qijie" are all excellent in singing and doing, and are not inferior to her sister Eyung. She is tall and slender, and when she puts on powder and appears on the stage, her posture is light and graceful, and her eyes are as if a beauty in the flowers. Moreover, her manners are graceful, and she is able to express all the truth, lewdness, solemnity, and evil to the fullest extent. Her hands, eyes, and steps are all in place, which is due to her sister's day and night influence. Yiyun has been a guest in the north for a long time. The Beijing white is soft, light, and round, and every word is like a pearl, so the play "Getaway" is undoubtedly a masterpiece of massage.

### Combination of Drama and Film: Shen Min and Han Fei Appear on the Silver Screen

— Bai Ding

"Flowers Splashed with Tears" and "Silent Night" to be Performed Separately

Drama and film are essentially sister arts, both shouldering the mission of promoting culture, education, and society. Therefore, stage workers and film practitioners help each other and even walk two roads with the same step. In the past, Jin Shan, Wang Ying, Zhao Dan, Yuan Muzhi, and others all walked this artistic path together.

After the war, this trend became even more pronounced. People like Gu Yelu, He Bin, Huang He, Tu Guangqi, Ding Zhisun, Jing Lu, and Chen Qi all leaped from the stage to the silver screen, bringing vigor to the lonely film industry.

Recently, two more stage workers are about to appear on the silver screen. One is Han Fei, who is a fundamental actor of the Shanghai Drama Society! He has played many roles, and his Juehui in "Home" is even more praised by the audience. His debut film is "Silent Night," in which he and Zhou Xuan play the male and female leads, showing the importance attached to him by the Guohua authorities, because Guohua originally had two male leads, Bai Yun and Lü Yukun.

The other is Shen Min, who is a hot girl with the style of Li Lili. However, she is good at performing tragedies. Her performances in "Night Shanghai" and "Sea Love" have been unanimously praised as outstanding artists who have emerged in the drama world. Now, she has been invited by the Golden Star authorities and signed a three-year long-term contract. She will first play Gu Xiaomei in "Flowers Splashed with Tears," which is also a tragic female lead. Her performance will definitely not be bad!

In the artistic intersection of drama and film, Shen Min and Han Fei moving from the stage to the silver screen is a piece of good news!

### Brief Biographies of Peking Opera Figures

— Nan Mu Bei Diao Ren Nan Qiang Bei Diao Ren, I Write Biographies and Make Illustrations

(Three) Zhou Xinfang

Qilin Tong, an actor, is the host of the Yifeng Society Troupe at the Carlton Grand Theater. His original surname was Zhou, named Xinfang, styled Shichu. In his early years, he joined the Xiliancheng class in the old capital (but was not a disciple of that class, only an attached member). Because of a hoarse voice, he switched to specializing in *zuogong* roles, enjoying great reputation in the north and south of the Yangtze River for more than thirty years without declining. Those who study *zuogong laosheng* (old male roles characterized by dignified acting) today all take the "Qilin School" as their benchmark. In recent years, his voice has greatly improved, and he occasionally performs excerpts from plays such as "Fourth Son Visits His Mother" and "Pearl Curtain Village," and there is even talk of performing "Empty City Stratagem." He is usually enthusiastic about public welfare. Zhou always stands up for matters that benefit fellow performers in the Peking Opera world. Take the matter of redeeming the houses in Liyuan Lane as an example. He repeatedly performed charity shows and was invaded by illness as a result but did not care. The property was finally redeemed, so the northern and southern performing arts circles praised his virtue. He is forty-nine years old, and none of his children have entered the Peking Opera world. His eldest son, Pi Cheng, studies aviation and is currently flying in the provisional capital. His ancestral home is Ningbo, Zhejiang. Zhou Xinfang and Han Jinkui are the only Ningbo actors who enjoy great reputation in the south. (Cheng Yanqiu will be published next Wednesday)

Chapter Eight: Fallen Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water

He Ji was originally a flirtatious girl, but after marrying Wang Yongtai, she often complained that Yongtai was old and did not know how to cherish her, so she felt very dissatisfied. After her cousin Sang Yiqing came, she often secretly pursued pleasure with Sang Yiqing behind Yongtai's back. Originally, she had an affair with her cousin Sang Yiqing before she married Wang Yongtai. It was only because Sang Yiqing already had a wife that he did not dare to be open about it. Now that Sang Yiqing's wife has died of illness outside, and he has taken up residence at Wang's house, the old embers have naturally rekindled, and the old love has been rekindled. Wang Yongtai, however, seemed to be kept in the dark, and did not notice it, but Xu Jing saw it. And He Ji not only did not guard against Xu Jing, but fell in love with Xu Jing, because she compared Xu Jing's handsome appearance with Sang Yiqing, and felt that there was a world of difference. So she deliberately flattered Xu Jing, wanting to have a physical relationship with Xu Jing. Tonight, she specially imitated Zhuo Wenjun eloping with Sima Xiangru, and came to Xu Jing's room to express her admiration, thinking that if Xu Jing was not a dull man, he would definitely not escape the net of love. Who knew that Xu Jing was as unyielding as a mountain, and did not take her bait? She had to force a smile, leave on her own, and say, "Good, you are indeed a good man!" Xu Jing was stunned when he heard this, standing still and waiting for her to speak. He Ji then said, "Because the old man often praises you, young master, as a young hero in front of me, I didn't quite believe it, so I pretended to come and test you. You are indeed as unyielding as iron and stone, which I admire very much. You don't need to tell the old man anything, lest he become suspicious. I'm leaving now, I wish you well, young master." After He Ji said these words, she smiled and nodded at Xu Jing, and gracefully left the room. Xu Jing was dubious after hearing these words, sitting quietly and thinking. Did He Ji really deliberately test his feelings? But looking at her seductive posture, it was clear that she wanted to seduce me. Now she says these words, it is just to cover up her ugly behavior. How can I fall for her trick? But I don't want to reveal this matter in front of Wang Yongtai, and see how things develop later. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel sorry for Wang Yongtai. The old hero is warm-hearted and loyal, but he has married such a licentious and lowly woman, isn't it tarnishing the old hero's reputation for life? That night, the more he thought about it, the more resentful he became, and he couldn't sleep well. The next day was the sixteenth, and the moonlight was very good in the evening. Xu Jing was afraid that He Ji might come again, so he closed his door early and went to sleep. In the middle of the night, he suddenly felt an urgent need to relieve himself. Unable to hold back, he put on his clothes and got up, opened the door, walked from the courtyard to the toilet, and emptied the contents of his stomach, feeling very refreshed. (59)

### An Outline of the Philosophy of Diligent Practice

— Zong Yu

The power of matter should be acknowledged, and further, matter should be made my oxen and horses. The power of matter should be utilized as much as possible to achieve a better life, as well as a part of the ideal life, and to fulfill the mission of a person of my time.
