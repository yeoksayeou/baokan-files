### Great Victory in Counteroffensive by Jin-Nan Chinese Army: Japanese Troops in Henglingguan Area Suffer Losses and Retreat; Japanese Attempt to Invade Western Mountains of Nanchang in Multiple Routes Fails

Luoyang: Since launching a counteroffensive, the Jin-Nan Chinese army has achieved great victories for days on end. The Japanese army has suffered heavy losses, and the Chinese lines have made progress. (Telegraph dated 4th)

Tokyo: According to news received here, Chinese troops are now launching a counteroffensive against Japanese positions in southeastern Shanxi. (Haitong News Agency dispatch dated 4th)

Luoyang: Japanese troops are frequently increasing in the Yicheng and Qingshui areas. The Japanese troops in the Henglingguan area, after being continuously attacked by the Chinese, are extremely panicked and retreating steadily. The highway in the Jiwangshan area, which the Japanese attempted to rush repairs on, has been repeatedly attacked and damaged by the Chinese, and work has now ceased. (Telegraph dated 4th)

Chongqing: Military news: Japanese troops in the Dianjunpo area on the opposite bank of Yichang shelled Mujiaodian and other places on the morning of the 3rd, with many shells being poison gas shells. Also, on the 31st, a unit of Japanese troops northeast of Yichang was severely attacked by the Chinese army, with over a hundred Japanese killed. (Telegraph dated 4th)

Ji'an: On the morning of the 30th, over a thousand Japanese troops from Nanchang advanced towards the Chinese Western Mountains in two routes. They were bravely met and attacked by a certain Chinese unit. By evening, the Japanese had suffered hundreds of casualties, and their offensive was thwarted. (Telegraph dated 3rd)

Xiushui: On the 30th of last month, the Chinese army attacked and assaulted Beizhangshupu, north of Zhangshu, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese for two hours. The Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. The Chinese forces surged into the Japanese strongholds, completely destroying their fortifications. It is estimated that in this battle, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and many spoils of war were seized. (Telegraph dated 3rd)

Chongqing: There are rumors that Japan is about to launch a major offensive in the Far East, either attacking Singapore or Hong Kong. Well-informed foreigners here are quite skeptical of this claim. Although it is widely rumored that a large number of Japanese warships, transport ships, and troops are currently gathered on Hainan Island, according to reliable foreign sources, there is no heavy troop concentration on Hainan Island. As for the claim that Japanese troops are heavily concentrated in Guangzhou, according to reliable foreign sources, the number of Japanese troops currently stationed there is no more than one division. Moreover, since the Pearl River has been opened for trade by third countries, the Japanese army is unlikely to invade Hong Kong at present. If the Japanese army does launch any major offensive in the Pacific, it will inevitably lead to war with Britain and the United States. Therefore, if the Japanese take any action, it must be something more important than Hong Kong. So, do the Japanese intend to take action in the Guangzhou area? According to foreign sources, the Japanese army may attack the Dongjiang area in an attempt to prevent goods from entering the mainland via the Dongjiang River. Small-scale battles have already begun in the area in the past week, but it is not believed that these small battles will develop into large-scale warfare. (Reuters dispatch dated 3rd)

### Zhang Qun Arrives in Chongqing to Report on His Work

Chongqing: Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government and Chairman of the Sichuan-Kang Development Company, flew to Chongqing from Chengdu yesterday afternoon and immediately called on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on his work. It is reported that the capital of the Development Company has been determined to be 70 million yuan, with the central government contributing 30 million, Sichuan Province 7 million, Xikang 3 million, and another 30 million to be raised from private investors. The company's business will focus on developing mineral resources and establishing factories, while also taking into account agricultural benefits. Its mission is not only to strengthen combat capabilities but also to lay the foundation for heavy industry in the interior. This is because the Chinese government, in light of the lessons learned by coastal industries in this decisive battle, does not want all industries to be concentrated in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan and other places again in the future.

### Japanese Casualties Since the Outbreak of War Exceed 1.6 Million; War Expenses Consume Over 164 Billion Yuan; Cash Reserves Exhausted and Food Panic Occurs

Chongqing: Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin recently issued a New Year's message, reviewing the military situation since the start of the war. He divided it into two periods, before and after the fall of the Yuehan Railway, for comparison. The first stage of the first period was the Battle of Shanghai and Nanjing. The Japanese army used 25 divisions, fought 83 battles, and occupied an area of over 620,000 square kilometers. The second stage was the Battle of Xuzhou, using 29 divisions, fighting 91 battles, and occupying 320,000 square kilometers. The so-called occupied areas that could be actually controlled were less than one-tenth. After the fall of the Yuehan Railway, the second period of the war began. China no longer adhered to the principle of exchanging space for time but launched counteroffensives at any time. In this period, up to February of the 29th year, was the first stage. The Japanese army increased to 37 divisions, fought 163 battles, and occupied 77,000 square kilometers. From February to the present is the second stage, with 68 battles and a front line of about 10,000 kilometers. As for the nature of the battles, those initiated by the Chinese side initially accounted for 7%, but have now increased to 45%. This proves that the Japanese side has become increasingly weak. In this war, the Japanese side has suffered a total of 1.6 million casualties, conscripted troops 37 times, accounting for 83% of the country's able-bodied men, and consumed over 164 billion yuan in war expenses. Cash reserves have been exhausted, and a food panic has occurred. Therefore, in the near future, its military strength can be completely eliminated. (Havas News Agency dispatch dated 1st)

### Various Circles in the Provisional Capital Enthusiastically Celebrate New Year's Day; Remote Homage to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum; Chairman Lin Broadcasts to the Nation

Chongqing: Today is New Year's Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China. The international situation is extremely favorable, and the weather is also clear and warm. Chongqing is celebrating enthusiastically, and the scale is unprecedented in previous years. This is due to the response of the people's minds, and the government authorities also have the intention of encouraging it. Various agencies, schools, and organizations are decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers, and stores are hanging national flags. Patriotic slogans can be seen everywhere. The streets are filled with pedestrians. The program this morning began with monthly meetings. The monthly meeting of the Central Party Headquarters also included a section on remotely paying homage to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, which added a solemn element to the joy. At 8 a.m., the Chongqing District Boy Scouts held a grand review, with more than 40 units participating. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a new speech and inspected them. After the review, a parade began, followed by a sports parade team. The team included soldiers, sailors, airmen, police, athletes from various universities, and folk martial arts troupes. The parade lasted for more than three hours. The large number of participants can be seen from this. There are also various other programs that cannot be listed in detail, such as banquets and broadcasts. During the banquet for central dignitaries, the sounds of toasting and guessing games were broadcast overseas by international radio stations to invite overseas Chinese to raise a glass of victory together, so the scope of the celebration extends overseas. Another important program for celebrating the New Year is to comfort honorary veterans and the families of soldiers fighting in the war. After inspecting the Boy Scouts, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek comforted the wounded soldiers and the families of soldiers fighting in the war. In an extremely joyful attitude, he told them, "You know that we have already won now." Those who heard this were extremely moved and wanted to weep. In addition, the 1.7 million yuan in comfort funds allocated by the Women's Comfort Association was distributed simultaneously across the country this morning, along with a comfort letter and supplies from Madame Chiang Kai-shek. (Havas News Agency dispatch dated 1st)

Chongqing: Chairman Lin Sen delivered a broadcast speech to compatriots at home and abroad on New Year's Day at the Central Broadcasting Station. The general meaning is roughly divided into several major points: (1) Enhance national spirit, adhere to fighting to the end to achieve the goal of national liberation; (2) Promote local autonomy and intensify political construction to complete constitutional government; (3) Practice economic construction and solve the problem of survival to achieve a well-off life for the people. Finally, he encouraged compatriots across the country to work together to complete the great mission. (Telegraph dated 1st)

New Year's Message from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek

Chongqing: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek warned the people of China last night that 1941 will be a year of life and death for China, urging the people to work hard to increase the spirit of sacrifice in order to finally defeat Japan. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's address was broadcast by radio, expressing his appreciation for President Roosevelt's promise in his recent speech to provide as much assistance as possible to China. However, he encouraged the people to make the greatest efforts this year to seek victory so as not to disappoint the great assistance of "friendly countries such as the United States" and the great achievements of the martyrs who died for the country. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also vigorously declared the importance of construction projects, which must be carried out even during the war, because the strength of the country to seek victory and peace must rely on the achievements of wartime construction. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also praised the construction projects of the Soviet Union, calling them the reason for the Soviet Union's strong national power today, which is entirely due to domestic construction. Before Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered his speech, many people had gathered in front of the broadcasting machines in the streets of Chongqing. When the speech began, they set off firecrackers to express their enthusiasm. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's voice was heavy and fluent. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek quoted President Roosevelt's words in his speech, saying that "China is fighting a great war to defend freedom against Japan. Danger cannot be avoided by fear. To deal with the uncompromising nature of Japanese violence is like reasoning with burning bombs for us." He then quoted President Roosevelt's warning to the American people, saying, "In today's world, in order to survive, we should place our economic institutions under wartime organization and create a permanent military." Chairman Chiang Kai-shek called these words an "incisive inscription," pointing out the importance of China's war to the overall world situation and also pointing out the great way to establish a country today. We should listen to such solemn, grand, ideal, and insightful warnings and be vigilant and invigorated to thank our friendly countries. Therefore, China's war must be fought to the end without懈怠, and we must not rest until we achieve China's freedom and security. At the same time, construction projects must be completed to achieve a state of permanent military preparedness. This is just as Dr. Sun Yat-sen instructed, requiring long-term survival in the world, and this is indispensable. I am specifically raising the importance of national construction work today in order to make the people understand that construction projects must be carried out simultaneously in the midst of bloody battles, and these projects must be completed in order to increase national strength and achieve victory in the war. Moreover, we must achieve various goals in order to be worthy of the martyrs who died for the country and the sympathy and assistance of friendly countries. (United Press dispatch dated 1st)

### Editorial

— International Dynamics in the New Year

Time flies, and the three-day holiday has passed in an instant. Although there have been no dramatic changes in the international situation in the past few days, all the dynamics are sufficient to reflect the tense atmosphere of the current situation. The alarm bell that strikes the heart is ringing everywhere; everyone says that this year is the "year of settlement" for the world situation, and the giant wheel of the times seems to be waiting for everyone to safely pass the New Year before accelerating forward.

After President Roosevelt delivered a "fireside chat" on New Year's Eve, severely criticizing Japan, Germany, and Italy and supporting China, Britain, and all anti-aggression countries, he immediately began drafting a large-scale "lend-lease" plan, advocating to lease a large amount of military equipment to China, Britain, and even Greece. When the US Congress meets tomorrow, Roosevelt will personally propose this plan. Regarding the part for Britain, it is rumored that the United States intends to provide Britain with a second batch of 50 destroyers. As for the large-scale supply of American aircraft to China and Britain, it seems to be largely certain. This is one aspect. It is reported that the US fleet has decided to remain in Hawaiian waters this year and will no longer engage in routine exercises. In other words, the US Navy will concentrate on the Pacific Ocean to monitor the development of the Far East situation. This is a perfect "counter-demonstration" in the face of German "pirate ships" flying the Japanese flag and lurking in the South Pacific, and Japan's intensified preparations for advancing south. This is the second aspect. After inspecting Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, and other places, Maurice, a special correspondent of the United Press, cited the talks of Rear Admiral Layton, commander of the British fleet in China, Sir Pufang, Governor of the Straits Settlements and Commander of the Far East Military Region, and Wu Tiecheng, Minister of Overseas Affairs of China, and issued a telegram, forcefully saying that "the Chinese, British, and American front line in Asia has entered the New Year with the greatest confidence, determined to defend the rights of the three countries in the East, and will not hesitate to use force when necessary." This is another proof of close cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States. This is related to the overall situation in the Far East.

As for the dynamics in Europe, there are also several important reports: First, since the reorganization of the French cabinet and the dismissal of the pro-German Laval, France and Germany have been conducting negotiations in Paris. Although the content has never been officially announced, it is conceivable that Hitler is dissatisfied with the "strong attitude" of the Vichy government. According to recent rumors, Petain has refused Germany's request to hand over the fleet and French ports on both sides of the Mediterranean. Therefore, the negotiations between the two sides have broken down. It is rumored that Germany will threaten to abolish the armistice agreement and occupy the French free zone. If this rumor is true, it is tantamount to forcing the defeated France to fight Germany and Italy again. Although the entire French mainland may fall, the entire colonial empire will inevitably rise up in resistance. And the French fleet, which Hitler covets most, seems to become a weapon for Britain's counteroffensive in a turnaround, which is certainly detrimental to the Axis powers' current military situation in the Mediterranean. If Germany occupies the entire territory of France, although it can gain a few more bases on the southern Mediterranean coast, it is feared that before it has gained a firm foothold, the British fleet, air force, and the Free French army will use French Africa and Malta as bases and launch a dense attack on the French mainland, and even attempt to "land." This is the possible consequence, which will make Hitler face a "southern front" in addition to dealing with the western front (against Britain) and the eastern front (assisting Italy). At this moment, US Ambassador to France Admiral Leahy has already taken office, implying that Washington is prepared to support Vichy. Given that Italy has repeatedly suffered defeats and the prestige of the Axis powers is gradually declining, there seems to be no reason to believe that this "old hero of Verdun" will bend his knees again.

Second, regarding the situation in the Balkans: Greek troops are advancing north along the Adriatic coast and are said to have approached Vlora, one of Albania's two major ports. In this final moment of the Blackshirts' deteriorating situation, Germany finally sent a part of its air force to Italy to help. This is more a necessary arrangement based on Germany's "need for self-defense" than to help Italy. Similarly, the entry of 300,000 German troops into Romania can be explained in a positive sense as a military measure by Germany to prepare to disregard everything and pass through Bulgaria or Yugoslavia. But in a negative sense, who can guarantee that it is not a precautionary measure by Hitler, worried about the "collapse" of the eastern front. Looking back at the recent past six months, that is, from the fall of France last June until now, the Axis powers have not only wasted time but have also suffered losses, watching Britain's position become more consolidated day by day and US aid become more active day by day. Therefore, in Hitler's military plan, he must consider a new target. Specifically, Hitler must take into account the increasing strength of the British air force. Therefore, before the balance of power between the British and German air forces reverses, that is, before Britain gains "air supremacy," Hitler must quickly complete his war plan so as not to "lose everything." It is expected that as a result of Britain's reliance on US assistance, the strength of the British air force will surpass Germany this autumn. Therefore, Germany's war plan, whether it is to attack Britain or break through the Mediterranean blockade, must be completed before autumn; otherwise, Germany's military advantage up to now will inevitably waver, and ultimately affect the trend of the entire war and make the final settlement unfavorable to Germany. Therefore, Hitler must take various actions and arrangements at this moment, and his last resort must be a "desperate gamble," which is almost "destined."

In short, the two sets of wars in Europe and Asia have entered a similar stage this year: The side that has always been on the defensive has gradually gained the initiative and begun to tend towards a counteroffensive due to the adjustment and training of internal forces and the strengthening of external assistance; as for the side that has always been on the offensive, due to long-term consumption in the past and continuous failures, it is eager to take a risk before the other side is strong enough to counterattack, in order to remedy the weaknesses that have already been exposed and seize this more favorable "settlement." But how the settlement will turn out can also be said to be predetermined.

### 法泰官員 在維希進行談判 泰外長否認談判業已開始 日艦刻正不斷運軍火至泰

Hanoi: Official sources announced yesterday that Thai and French officials are currently engaged in negotiations in Vichy to resolve the intermittent "ping-pong" warfare along the Mekong River. It is reported that the negotiator is the Thai envoy to Vichy and the French authorities. French officials have not indicated whether the chances of resolving the dispute are good or bad. Unofficial reports indicate that Japanese warships are constantly transporting military supplies to Thailand. Thai forces resumed firing on French positions in the Houei Sai area on Wednesday. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Vichy: A French news agency dispatch from Hanoi states that new incidents have occurred at various points along the Vietnam-Thailand border, but the situation is not serious. (Reuters, 4th)

Vichy: Regarding the border dispute between Thailand and Vietnam, the government has received a report from Lieutenant General Decoux, Governor-General of Vietnam, stating that in recent days, Thai and Vietnamese patrol teams have repeatedly clashed in northern Laos and along the Mekong River in Cambodia. For example, on December 30th of last year, the two sides exchanged fire near the town of Pakse on the Mekong River, resulting in minor injuries to a French officer. French forces fired on a Thai speedboat ten miles east of Vieng Chan, forcing Thai soldiers to abandon the boat and flee. On the first of this month, the two sides clashed again twenty miles northeast of Pailin, Cambodia, at Phum Kok and Phum Thmei. One Vietnamese indigenous soldier was wounded. On the same day, Thai forces again opened fire on indigenous troop positions at Vieng Xai, 130 miles west of Luang Prabang, Laos. Several Thai aircraft also flew over Vieng Chan, distributing anti-French leaflets. As of yesterday, Thai forces also shelled Phum Pak Song, sixteen miles southeast of Savannakhet. (Havas, 3rd)

Hanoi: Well-informed circles believed yesterday that the United States has recently intervened repeatedly in the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute in an attempt to clarify the situation. Another unofficial source believes that Britain and the United States will also work together to persuade Thailand to move closer to a resolution. (Associated Press, 4th)

Hanoi: Authoritative sources stated yesterday that the United States recently protested to Vichy and Tokyo regarding the detention by the Japanese in French Indochina of American goods valued at $3,000,000. American sources claim that they believe that as long as Japanese soldiers continue to control all actions in Vietnam, their protests to Vichy and Tokyo will have no effect. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Bangkok: Reporters learned today that the Thai government has recognized the French envoy to Bangkok, and negotiations to resolve the Thai-Vietnamese dispute are about to begin. Thai Acting Foreign Minister Yayahananma told an Associated Press reporter that French Foreign Minister Flandin telegraphed yesterday, appointing the Counsellor of the French Legation here, Mr. Garreau, as Chargé d'Affaires. The Thai government immediately recognized Mr. Garreau, and negotiations between the Thai government and Mr. Garreau are expected to begin soon. However, negotiations must still be based on the return of the two territories demanded by Thailand. Mr. Yayahananma denied that the Thai government expanded its demands to include all of Cambodia and Laos, stating that Thailand still maintains its original demands, namely the return of the areas within Cambodia and Laos that previously belonged to Thailand. It would be best if France could concede to Thailand's demands at this time. If a large-scale war breaks out, then Thailand will have to make further demands in the future. Mr. Yayahananma also denied reports that Thai-French negotiations were taking place in Vichy, stating that the Thai envoy to France is currently in Lisbon and no negotiations are being held at this time. The new French Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Garreau, told reporters that his mission is to prepare a basis for negotiations for the French representative to be sent to Thailand in the future. Mr. Garreau also said that if the people can accept goodwill, the problem can often be solved. Mr. Garreau declined to discuss France's proposals, but reliable sources said that Mr. Garreau may ask Thailand to suspend negotiations on the return of territory and discuss it after the end of the European war.

### 孔祥熙報告 施政狀況（續）

Chongqing: On the financial front, since the start of the war, with hundreds of thousands of troops fighting for more than three years, the supply of military needs has been enormous, and the increase in national expenditure is unavoidable. The Japanese have repeatedly engaged in sabotage against our financial system. Prevention and control must be taken very seriously. However, some who do not understand the truth, harbor personal opinions, pick up rumors, and engage in unsubstantiated propaganda, directly confusing public opinion, shaking people's hearts, and indirectly supporting the Japanese, weakening the war effort, which is truly regrettable. Fortunately, thanks to the leader's guidance and the people's enthusiastic support, we have been able to cope adequately for three years of war. Since this year, all financial adjustments in the rear have been able to meet the needs of the military and lay the foundation for national construction. The points that can be mentioned are as follows:

First, in response to the Japanese economic blockade, we strive for economic and financial self-sufficiency. In order to increase domestic agricultural, industrial, and mining production to achieve economic self-sufficiency, the government has directed the Ministry of Finance to urge various banks to expand agricultural loans and industrial production investment, strengthen the management of foreign trade, and order the Central Trust Bureau to handle wartime land insurance. In terms of agricultural loans, the total amount loaned in the 28th year of the Republic (1939) reached over 110 million yuan. In the 29th year of the Republic (1940), there was even more investment in industrial production: 165.4 million yuan in state-owned industries and about 38 million yuan in assisting private industries, for a total of over 200 million yuan. The purpose of this large-scale production investment is to encourage production, develop the rear economy, and expand tax revenues. As for the management of foreign trade, it is a necessary measure to balance international payments and facilitate the acquisition of foreign materials. To strengthen this work, the internal structure of the Trade Commission was slightly adjusted at the beginning of this year, so that administration and business are separated. The administrative aspects are unified under the management of the Commission, while the production, transportation, and sales of export materials are handled by three companies, including Fuxing Tea. The authority is unified, the responsibilities are clear, and the efficiency has improved significantly. In terms of finance, increasing tax revenue and promoting public bonds are important methods for raising wartime finance. The Ministry of Finance continues to make efforts in this regard. The original taxes have been adjusted separately, and special attention is paid to the promotion of direct taxes. In addition to the income tax, which had already begun to be levied before the war, wartime excess profits tax and inheritance tax have been successively levied. The collection of excess profits tax has been particularly successful. The promotion of public bonds has been improved by the formulation and implementation of methods for encouraging subscription and promotion. A wartime public bond promotion committee has been organized, bringing together people of high reputation in the country to jointly assume the responsibility of promotion. With the concerted efforts of the government and the people, we will surely achieve good results.

Second, in response to the Japanese economic aggression, we strive to seize economic resources in the war zones. Recognizing that the invasion of China has been ineffective and that prolonged war will deepen the economic crisis of other countries, the Japanese have proposed the slogan of "using war to sustain war." Since the winter of last year, they have intensified economic aggression in the occupied areas, extracting materials from our occupied areas on the one hand and dumping Japanese goods into our rear on the other. To prevent smuggling, the Ministry of Finance has specially established cargo inspection offices in various war zones to handle the inspection of Japanese goods. Recently, a general anti-smuggling office has been established to uniformly direct anti-smuggling work nationwide. This can currently strengthen economic warfare capabilities. On the active side, war zone economic commissions have been organized to engage in the work of seizing economic resources in the war zones, according to the needs of each place and adapting to the times. They have now been established one after another and are performing their duties.

Third, strengthening financial institutions and consolidating the foundation of the legal tender. Since the establishment of the Joint Treasury, the President has personally served as chairman, and the cooperation of various banks has become more effective. The various banks have now established branches and sub-branches in the Northwest and Southwest provinces to complete the national financial network. Financial institutions have been greatly strengthened. The cash reserve of the legal tender is not very sufficient. Recently, the establishment of foreign exchange reserves through British and American loans has become more robust, exceeding 50%. In order to consolidate the foundation of the legal tender, the government has paid special attention to absorbing remittances from overseas Chinese and redeeming raw gold and silver, with marked results. In addition, the implementation of the Public Treasury Law, the increase in food supervision and regulation, and the control of import and export goods are all important financial measures to meet the needs of the war. In the past year, with countless initiatives and complex strategies, it is fortunate that there have been no major mistakes.

The work in the coming year is expected to be even more difficult. In order to plan in detail, the Ministry of Finance has formulated a work plan for the 30th year of the Republic (1941). In addition to reviewing the gains and losses of the matters listed above and continuing to promote them, special attention will be paid to implementing the following matters: (1) Strengthening the anti-smuggling organization and controlling the import of non-essential goods; (2) Adjusting import and export tax rates to protect domestic production; (3) Expanding the types of consolidated tax collection to increase tax revenue; (4) Implementing the new income tax law and effectively promoting excess profits tax; (5) Continuing to set aside customs and salt taxes to guarantee debt repayment and maintain credit; (6) Reorganizing local finance to adapt to the needs of the new county system; (7) Establishing county banks and strengthening the financial network in the Southwest and Northwest, enriching currency reserves to consolidate the foundation of the legal tender; (8) Promoting thrift and savings, and encouraging national donations.

All the financial measures in recent years have regrettably failed to fully meet the wishes of the people. However, there are two things that I can report to the people: (1) The establishment of a financial system; (2) The outstanding credit of the government. Systems such as the budget system, accounting, and auditing have long been in place. The construction of the financial system and the implementation of the legal tender policy have made great contributions to the war effort. The implementation of the public treasury system is the beginning of building a clean government. Although it has not yet been widely implemented due to various difficulties, the amount of wasteful expenditure saved by the treasury in the past year has been substantial.

Since the start of the war, it has been very difficult to raise funds. The Ministry of Finance has never delayed the repayment of domestic and foreign debts, except for special reasons. As a result, the government's credit at home and abroad has always been outstanding. This is of great benefit to raising war funds and to post-war construction. Even the establishment of British and American loans has various reasons, but our government's consistent adherence to deadlines and maintenance of credit also plays a significant role. Therefore, Mr. Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, has repeatedly made statements praising our trustworthiness and prompt repayment of debts, which shows how much international friends value our respect for integrity. Financial management does not require the art of turning stone into gold, and in fact, there is no such art. Systems and credit are our greatest achievements. With sound systems and good credit, all difficulties can be overcome.

### 德派遣空軍義 參加地中海戰爭 一部分已在阿境活動 助德攻英之義機撤回

Rome: According to an official announcement yesterday, several German air squadrons will soon fly to Italy to assist in the Mediterranean theater. At the same time, Italian aircraft assisting Germany in attacking Britain in the English Channel will be withdrawn. It is believed that the German air force to be sent there will include all equipment. It is claimed that this German air force will be under the control of the Italian high command. The number of aircraft moving to the Mediterranean is estimated to be in the hundreds. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Rome: General Pricolo, Chief of Staff of the Italian Air Force, issued a message to the air force officers and soldiers, stating, "The German air force, which has repeatedly achieved brilliant feats in Northern Europe, will come to Italy and be stationed at the naval and air force bases in the Mediterranean to assist Italy in combat. This is welcomed by the entire nation. The combat spirit of Germany and Italy will be even closer from now on. I wish the German air force officers and soldiers participating in the Italian war an early completion of the common victory of Germany and Italy." (Haitong, 3rd)

London: The news of the German air force arriving in Italy is interpreted as Mussolini transferring some of his air force command to Germany. The extent of the transfer will depend on the scope of assistance provided by Germany. Mussolini was originally unwilling to receive this assistance, but now he has to accept it. The Italian side may think that Italy sent aircraft to Belgium to help Germany attack Britain, so Germany is sending its air force to Italy to assist in combat as a reward. However, the Italian aircraft assisting Germany in attacking Britain have now been withdrawn to Italy. Italian sources say that a portion of the German air force has arrived in Italy, and others say that a large number of German aircraft have arrived in Italy. Regardless of how many German aircraft have arrived in Italy, they will certainly not be under Italian control. (Reuters, 3rd)

Istanbul: British sources recently claimed that a large number of German aircraft have been cooperating with the Italian air force, fighting British and Greek forces in Albania. Fifty German Junker transport planes have been active between Brindisi, Agioi Saranda, Durrës, and Elbasan, major ports in southeastern Italy and Albania. In addition, dozens of German Stuka dive bombers and light bombers, manned by 400 airmen, have been cooperating with the Italian air force in Albania for several weeks. (Associated Press, 4th)

Berlin: The "German Diplomatic Political Correspondence" recently published an article commenting on Germany's dispatch of air force to Italy, stating that the Axis is not only a tool for the common policy of Germany and Italy but also a tool for joint operations. Britain thought that the Axis countries would not fight shoulder to shoulder, and now it will prove that this is a vain hope. Britain is the common enemy of the Axis countries, so Germany and Italy will inevitably unite to deal with it. (Haitong, 4th)

### 澳軍大顯身手 突破巴迪亞外圍防線 英軍深入里比亞境七十哩 被俘義兵增至四萬三千人

London: A Reuters correspondent at British Army Headquarters in Egypt reports that the Australian troops, eager to show their skills for months, crept forward on Wednesday night under a dim crescent moon and began their first major battle at dawn on Thursday. This defensive line was about five miles long. The Australian troops charged in from the southwest corner, quickly capturing more than 40 fortified positions surrounded by barbed wire. Some of the defenders were killed, and many were captured. The concentration of the Australian troops' attack on one corner of the defensive line weakened the effectiveness of many of the Italian positions, as this position was arranged in a semi-circle, with most of the artillery facing outwards to defend against enemy troops attacking from within the circle. At present, as the British forces continue to advance, captured Italian military equipment can be found everywhere in the Western Desert. The correspondent claims to have recently driven a car through rows of Italian artillery, said to be part of the 329 cannons captured. Italian soldiers do not seem to cherish their weapons very much. Many of the guns captured by the British were clogged with sand, but once cleaned, most of them were in good working order. In addition, piles of Italian rifles, officer uniforms, tents, blankets, and bullets were also stacked into hills. Most of the captured Italian cars that were still usable have been incorporated into the British army. (Reuters, 4th)

London: A Reuters correspondent at British Army Headquarters in Egypt reports that the British commanders made systematic preparations before breaking through the defenses of Bardia. Small groups of Australian patrols had charged into the outer defenses of the area at night no less than dozens of times, reporting in detail on the Italian army's preparations and constantly bringing back captured Italian soldiers, from whom valuable intelligence was obtained. British reconnaissance planes flew over the defenses every day, taking pictures of the Italian army's deployment, which was extremely helpful for the British artillery's bombardment. (Reuters, 4th)

British Forces at the Libyan Front: British forces today penetrated 70 miles into Libya and attacked Italian forces just a few miles from the Italian coastal stronghold of Tobruk. Armored cars attacked the defenders of Tobruk all day, and reconnaissance planes discovered an important Italian airfield south of Tobruk, but no aircraft were seen. (Associated Press, 1st)

London: According to a communique released in Cairo today, including the 5,000 Italian soldiers captured in Bardia, a total of more than 43,000 Italian soldiers have been captured in the Western Desert. (Reuters, 4th)

Cairo: A British Air Force Headquarters communique states that the besieged city of Bardia was subjected to the most violent air raids rarely seen in the Middle East, carried out by British aircraft on Tuesday night and throughout Thursday. After British aircraft carried out a night attack on the city and inflicted heavy damage, they continued to attack fiercely from dawn to dusk. Buildings caught fire and were severely damaged, as confirmed by photographs taken. The motor transport concentration area and barracks west of the city were also severely damaged. The communique also states that on Wednesday night, British air force twice attacked ships in the port of Tripoli. During the initial attack, bombs were dropped on five cruisers moored in front of the southeastern embankment, hitting the customs wharf and a ship. Several fires broke out near the seaplane hangar, and explosions occurred frequently. The seaplane hangar also caught fire. During the second attack, the customs wharf was hit again, with five fires breaking out and three explosions occurring, possibly originating from ships moored in front of the wharf. Two giant motor ships were also hit, with thick smoke billowing like clouds. Flames could be seen flying sixty miles away. British aircraft also repeatedly flew reconnaissance missions over Italian East Africa, but there were no special matters to report. All aircraft returned safely. (Reuters, 4th)

### 北路希軍進攻 迫近愛爾巴桑 南路軍渡朋斯河 向伐洛那港推進

Athens: Officials announced yesterday that, with the help of the British air force, Greek forces are advancing towards Elbasan. According to news from Struga, Greek and Italian artillery are heavily shelling each other six miles from Elbasan. Several German mechanized units have already arrived there. According to news, Greek forces in the Tomorrica River area have occupied the village of Romais and are advancing north towards the foot of Mount Tomorr. Greek forces occupying Veligradë have advanced six kilometers northeast towards the Osum River. Greek forces advancing along the Lengarica Mountains encountered Italian resistance, but after fierce hand-to-hand combat, the Greek forces were able to continue advancing and occupy the village of Zome. In this battle, the Greek forces captured an Italian colonel and five other officers, 562 soldiers, two field guns, seven machine guns, and several mortars. This unit of Greek forces is now only 25 kilometers from Vlorë. Another unit of Greek forces has advanced towards the Sostica River valley and encountered strong resistance from Italian forces at a stronghold twelve kilometers southeast of Vlorë. (Associated Press, 4th)

London: London has received information that Greek forces are continuing to advance gradually in the Elbasan region of Albania. Military officials here say that Greek forces in the south have crossed the Ponces River, captured twelve cannons, twenty machine guns, and 500 Italian soldiers, demonstrating that the Greek forces continue to achieve good results. If the Greek forces continue to advance satisfactorily, they will likely threaten to cut off the Tepeelenë-Vlorë highway. The Ponces River flows southwest from Tepeelenë. Greek forces in the center have occupied Tovarištvo, which is about eighteen miles southeast of Berat. (Reuters, 4th)

### 德希邦交 並無變更

Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry today replied to reporters that the German-Greek border officials stationed in Italy were asked whether they would fight the Greeks, replying that the Foreign Ministry could not answer questions about military affairs. (Haitong, 4th)

### 羅境德大軍雲集 蘇聯嚴事戒備 在第尼斯特北岸一帶 紅軍集中防可能攻擊

Sofia: Officials acknowledged yesterday that if Germany were to ask Bulgaria for permission for German troops to pass freely through the country, Bulgaria would be forced to accept the request. Bulgarian observers estimate that there are already more than 250,000 German troops in Romania, while another 250,000 German troops are in Hungary. However, reliable sources close to the Axis countries say that the actual strength of German troops in Romania is close to 500,000. According to various sources, German troops have been moving rapidly towards Romania in the past few days. One observer says that an average of 70 trainloads of German soldiers are moving from Hungary to Romania every day. Berlin has not made a formal statement on this and initially denied the news when it was first heard. The Balkan countries are paying close attention to the movement of large numbers of German troops and supplies. Most observers believe that they are moving south to aid Italian forces in Greece. Another group of observers predicts that these German troops will be used to attack the Soviet Union to seize the rich Ukrainian region of the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 3rd)

New York: The "New York Times" reported that according to news from the Swiss capital, the Soviet Union has concentrated forces along the north bank of the Dniester River from Lemberg to Odessa. This situation suggests that the Soviet Union is now anticipating a German attack and plans to abandon the Stanislaviv area in Soviet-occupied Poland on the south bank of the Dniester River.

(Note: The Shanghai International News Agency published a Moscow dispatch yesterday stating that Stalin had sent a letter to Pravda, stating that the Soviet Union is currently facing threats.)

### Protecting the Premier: In Vienna, the Relationship between Bulgaria and the Axis Powers Will Be Clear Within Days

Vienna – Bulgarian Premier Filov yesterday engaged internist Dr. Eppinger here to treat his illness. During Filov's absence from the country, his duties will be handled by Foreign Minister Popov. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)

Sofia – A reporter from the newspaper "Vlima," who has exceptionally close contact with the Nazi side in Berlin, recently telegraphed stating that it is widely believed Premier Filov's trip to Vienna holds significant importance for the Balkan Peninsula. It is said that figures from the German political sphere are currently in Vienna, so Bulgaria's relationship with the Axis powers is expected to become clear by the end of this week. (Reuters Dispatch, 4th)

### German Air Force Launches Incendiary Blitz on England: Bristol and Wales Suffer Devastating Bombings; British Planes Strike Bremen Twice

London – Last night and early this morning, German air squadrons again launched a fierce "incendiary blitz" on the important port city of Bristol in western England. Countless incendiary and high-explosive bombs rained down, causing widespread fires that illuminated the city as if it were daylight. According to a special correspondent from the Associated Press, the fires and explosions in Bristol have formed one of the longest and most devastating bombing raids the city has endured since the beginning of the war. The intensity of this incendiary air raid is comparable to those recently experienced by London and Cardiff. At least three churches, two hospitals, several schools, one almshouse, and many private residences were destroyed. Firefighters and rescue teams bravely worked through the night amidst the frequent falling bombs. On one street, six houses were destroyed by high-explosive bombs, causing some rescuers to be buried in the rubble while trying to save civilians trapped within. Multiple fires broke out in residential areas, but most were quickly extinguished. Wave after wave of German aircraft bombed Bristol almost continuously from dusk throughout the night. The Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security both stated that the damage caused by the high-explosive bombs and fires in Bristol was immense. The two ministries' press releases also stated that there were many civilian casualties, but the overall number of deaths and injuries is not expected to be very high. (Associated Press Dispatch, 4th)

London – In retaliation for the British Air Force's attack on Bremen on Wednesday night, Hitler's air squadrons heavily bombed Cardiff in Wales last night, dropping thousands of incendiary bombs on the bustling commercial center, followed by multiple high-explosive bombs. However, the effects were minimal, thanks to the city's firefighting efforts. This was because Cardiff had already implemented a general mobilization for firefighting due to the fires in London on Sunday. Men, women, and even children rushed into the streets to assist the rescue teams in clearing away dangerous materials. According to press releases from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security, the main German attack last night was on a town in South Wales, where houses, shops, and other buildings suffered significant damage, and multiple fires broke out. However, most of the fires were quickly extinguished, and the remaining small fires were brought under control early this morning. Many people were killed and injured in the bombing of the town last night. Bombs also fell in other parts of England, but reports indicate minimal damage and casualties. (Associated Press Dispatch, 3rd)

London – On Wednesday night, the British Air Force attacked Bremen, Germany, dropping large quantities of high-explosive bombs and many incendiary bombs, causing widespread fires in the target area. British bombers also flew and bombed various locations in Germany, but Bremen suffered the heaviest damage. In the first hour alone, 20,000 incendiary bombs and several bombs were dropped. After the first bombing run, British pilots flying 120 miles away from the target looked back and could still see Bremen ablaze, with smoke and clouds reaching high into the sky. The weather that night was quite cold, but the moon was bright, so the British planes had a clear view of their targets when dropping bombs. The British planes primarily targeted the large shipyards. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

London – An Air Ministry press release stated that on Thursday, the British Air Force heavily bombed major shipyards and factories in Bremen throughout the night, first dropping incendiary bombs to start fires, followed by massive bombing with large bombs. Although this attack was not as large in scale as the one the night before, it lasted longer. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

### Southern Ireland Bombed Three Times in One Day; Southern Ireland Government Lodges Strong Protest with Germany

Dublin – Early this morning, an aircraft of unknown nationality dropped bombs in Dublin. This was the third bombing of Southern Irish territory within 24 hours. Houses were destroyed and people were injured in a densely populated area of the city. Yesterday, three bombs fell on a town in County Wexford. According to a statement from the Southern Irish Government Information Bureau, magnetic mines were discovered near the Irish coast, dropped by parachute near Greenore yesterday morning. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

Dublin – The Southern Irish Foreign Ministry announced that high-explosive and incendiary bombs had fallen in four locations in Southern Ireland. Examination of the bomb fragments revealed they were manufactured by Germany. The Southern Irish Chargé d'Affaires in Berlin has received instructions to lodge a strong protest with the German government against the German aircraft's violation of Irish territory and the bombing that caused injuries and damage. The protest demands full compensation and effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. The origin of the bombs that fell elsewhere is currently under investigation.

### Baudouin Suddenly Resigns; French Cabinet to Be Reorganized Again; Rome Insists on Territorial Demands from France; Berlin Denies Rupture in Franco-German Relations

Vichy – The French government issued a press release in the afternoon, stating that State Secretary Baudouin has resigned, but did not announce the reasons for the resignation. Well-informed sources believe that Baudouin's resignation is due to the actions of Foreign Minister Flandin. It is generally believed that Flandin will recommend Professor Portmann, former member of the Armistice Commission, to succeed Baudouin. Vignan-Carter, who was appointed by Baudouin to oversee information and propaganda affairs, will also be transferred to another position. (Haitong Telegram, 3rd)

Vichy – According to well-informed sources here, the resignation of Propaganda Minister Baudouin may be followed by a cabinet reshuffle. Marshal Pétain believes that this matter should not be handled hastily. Foreign Minister Flandin has expressed his agreement. It is said that a small committee composed of Foreign Minister Flandin, Naval Minister Darlan, and Army Minister Huntziger will consider this matter. These three are considered Marshal Pétain's main advisors. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 4th)

London – A French semi-official news agency stated that reports about a French cabinet reshuffle are premature. Some cabinet members may undergo changes soon, but nothing has been decided yet. (Reuters Dispatch, 4th)

London – Although the French semi-official press release stated that there would soon be some changes in the cabinet after the resignation of French cabinet member Baudouin, the situation in Vichy is reportedly very complex, and Italy's attitude makes this situation even more confused. It is reported that Italy is strongly advocating for (1) the abolition of the armistice agreement, (2) the occupation of the free zone of France, and (3) the cession of Nice, Corsica, and Tunis to Italy. It is expected that Hitler will meet with Mussolini this month to discuss solutions to the outstanding issues. (Reuters Dispatch, 4th)

Berlin – Well-informed sources here believe that rumors circulating outside about a rupture in Franco-German diplomatic relations are absurd. It is said that the ambassadors of both countries, Abetz and de Brinon, are continuing their activities. (Haitong Telegram, 3rd)

Vichy – Last night, the French government recognized to the United States the news of the Franco-German diplomatic relations rupture, as reported by the German official news agency. French authorities pointed out that the news was meaningless and said that Franco-German diplomatic relations had already been broken at the time of the declaration of war in September 1939, and that this broken diplomatic relationship has not been restored to this day. The current Franco-German relationship is the relationship between conqueror and conquered. Under this relationship, the conqueror enjoys all the spoils of war permitted by military practice and international law. Although the two countries have diplomatic negotiations, the scope of negotiations is limited to the armistice treaty. (Associated Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Vichy – After resigning today, Baudouin has requested permission from the German military authorities to go to the occupied zone to manage financial affairs in Paris. (Haitong Telegram, 3rd)

### Several French Warships Sent to North African Ports; Pétain Does Not Wish to Surrender to Germany; Armistice Agreement Should Be Respected

London – According to news obtained in London today, several French warships have sailed from French ports to French North African ports. General Pétain's strong action of sending the French fleet to North Africa surprised Hitler, who demanded an explanation from Pétain for this move. Pétain replied that it was to protect the French colonies and prevent an attack by England. According to the opinion of an independent French news agency, the sailing of French warships to North Africa shows General Pétain's determination to make Germany respect the spirit of the armistice agreement. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

London – Although several French warships are still docked in Toulon, it is reported that most of the destroyers and submarines have already sailed elsewhere, and many well-known French pilots who had been demobilized after the armistice have also gone to North Africa. (Reuters

New York – Today's "New York Times" Madrid dispatch said that according to news obtained there, German troops are now gathering along the line between the occupied and unoccupied zones of France. The only reason they have not occupied all of France is because of Pétain's threat to take the French fleet to Africa. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

### Statistics on Ships Sunk and Lost by Various Countries Since the Outbreak of the European War: Total Exceeds Three Million Tons; Comparison of Naval Losses Between Britain, Germany, and Italy

Washington – The U.S. Maritime Commission released statistics that since the beginning of the European War last September, the number of ships sunk worldwide has exceeded three million tons, and those heavily damaged have exceeded 300,000 tons. This number only covers up to October 5th. If we include the current month of January, the number would be far greater, because since October, German and Italian sea and air raids, submarine warfare, and maritime piracy have greatly intensified. The blockade suffered by Britain has reached its highest limit, and its shipping losses are the largest, with 349 merchant ships sunk, totaling 1,356,223 tons, not including those damaged or missing. The next largest losses were suffered by Germany, with 69 ships sunk, totaling 382,493 tons. Italy lost 16 ships, totaling 88,646 tons. France lost 29 ships, totaling 146,552 tons. In total, Britain and its allies, including the Netherlands, Norway, and Greece, lost 2,014,000 tons of ships. Britain is doing everything possible to replenish its shipping fleet, showing a great eagerness to get what it can, even if it is not the best. There is a plan to use "mass production" in the United States to build new ships, making full use of the capacity of American shipyards to build 300 ships simultaneously. Some people have proposed trying to create cement ships, because they are easy to build, have low costs, and can be completed quickly, but there have been no reports of actual construction yet. (Associated Press Dispatch, 4th)

London – In 1940, the British Navy lost a total of one aircraft carrier, three cruisers, ten armed merchant cruisers, thirty-three destroyers, and twenty-one submarines. German naval losses were two cruisers, twelve destroyers, one torpedo speedboat, one torpedo boat, one patrol boat, one anti-aircraft gun-equipped protection ship, and several submarines. Those injured are not included. Italian naval losses were one cruiser, eleven destroyers, and at least twenty-five submarines. In addition, three battleships, two cruisers, and two auxiliary ships were damaged in Taranto. (Reuters Dispatch, 4th)

### French Submarine Sunk by Mine En Route to Dakar

Vichy – The Navy Department recently announced that the French submarine "Sphinx" (1,500 tons) and the French oil tanker "Rhone" sailed from Casablanca, French Morocco, to Dakar, West Africa, on December 19th of last year. At 4:40 PM on that day, when they reached a certain sea area, the "Sphinx" suddenly experienced two violent explosions and immediately sank. Forty-five minutes later, the "Rhone" was also shaken by a violent explosion, apparently hit by a torpedo fired by a submarine of unknown nationality. It immediately caught fire and quickly sank. Sixty-four officers and men of the "Sphinx" and ten crew members of the "Rhone" were killed. (Havas Dispatch, 3rd)

London – According to the British Navy Department, there were no British submarines operating within 500 miles of the sinking location on the day the French submarine "Sphinx" and the oil tanker "Rhone" sank. (Reuters Dispatch, 4th)

### British Navy Uses Small Fast Ships: A Powerful Weapon Against Submarines

London – Reuters has learned that the British Navy is currently using a new weapon to counter submarines: small, fast ships derived from whaling ships. After the outbreak of the war, converted fishing boats were initially used to protect merchant shipping. However, to meet the need for protecting small, fast ships, these fast ships were built. Many are now in service, equipped with depth charges and anti-aircraft weapons. They sail in the Atlantic, assisting destroyers in escorting ships, providing day and night service and have already achieved combat successes. (Reuters Dispatch, 4th)

### Estimated Losses of British and German Air Forces: Ratio of One to Three

London – The British Air Ministry announced that in 1940, British fighters shot down 3,090 German aircraft in Britain alone. The activities of British anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons increased German aircraft losses to over 3,050. The total loss of British aircraft on all fronts, including all types, was 1,050. However, 400 of the airmen in these aircraft were rescued. (Associated Press Dispatch, 1st)

### Britain and Australia Jointly Respond to German Naval Activity in the South Pacific; Raider Captain Said to Be "Sea Devil"

British Ambassador Investigates Japanese Support for German Ships; It is Impossible for Japan to Strengthen Relations with Australia

Singapore – According to the Australian Navy Department today, enemy raiders have sunk ten ships in the Pacific in recent months. Of the 500 rescued passengers and crew members, who are of British, French, and Norwegian nationality, have now been transported from Emirau Island in the Bismarck Archipelago to a port in Australia by a ship that sailed from Australia. Admiral Layton, Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, recently stated in Singapore that both the British and Australian navies are aware of the raiders' activities and have taken appropriate measures. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

Hong Kong – A Norwegian sailor, who passed through Hong Kong two weeks ago, described the circumstances of the capture of a Norwegian ship in the South Pacific. His account is only now being disclosed. According to reports, when the Norwegian ship he served on was captured by a German South Pacific raider, the raider flew a blue flag. After the Norwegian crew members were taken aboard the raider, they witnessed another Norwegian oil tanker being captured and a British ship being sunk for resisting. The raider captain, Count von Luckner (who commanded German ships in the South Pacific during World War I and was known as the "Sea Devil"), addressed the captured British and Norwegian sailors, expressing regret for the loss of life, saying that this was "the fate of war." The raider was well-armed and treated prisoners well, providing them with the same food as the German crew. The Norwegian crew members were eventually transferred to an auxiliary ship and landed at a port in Japan, while the British crew members remained detained on the raider. Count von Luckner is familiar with the geography of the South Pacific, so the raider's hiding place is not easily discovered. (Reuters Dispatch, 4th)

Hong Kong – It is reported that one of the German raiders in the Pacific is the former Glen Line mail ship "Glenbeg." When German forces entered Denmark, the ship was docked in Danzig. It was later modified by the Germans and sailed to the Pacific by a circuitous route. It is said that it was flying the British flag at the time, and later changed to the Japanese flag. The ship also carried an aircraft for reconnaissance purposes. The ship weighed 9,460 tons and was built in Glasgow, England in 1922. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

London – London Chronicle news writer Butler recently stated that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has received instructions from the government to inquire with the Japanese government about reports that German raiders have been supplied in Japanese seaports. (Associated Press Dispatch, 2nd)

Canberra – Australian Navy Minister Hughes claimed that, according to reports received by the naval authorities, the raider that shelled the Australian-administered Nauru Island in the Pacific did indeed fly the Japanese flag during the attack, and the name of the Japanese ship it was using was clearly visible. All of this is undeniable. This action has undermined Japan's attempts to strengthen its relationship with Australia. He thinks the Germans will make some sort of explanation to Japan. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

### British Shipping Lanes in the Pacific to Be Replaced by American Merchant Ships

London – Yesterday, reliable sources said that the British and American governments are considering a plan in which British shipping lanes in the Pacific will be replaced by American merchant ships. This plan will allow British ships to be withdrawn for wartime emergency services in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. If this plan can be successfully implemented, British ships may replace American ships in British Pacific shipping lanes after the war. It is known that Mr. Kramer, a representative of the U.S. Customs, has already flown to New York by clipper in connection with this matter. It is said that Kramer will proceed directly to Washington to discuss this Pacific shipping plan with government officials and will return to London in six weeks to finalize all procedures. The British side proposed this plan a year ago, but it has not yet received support. (Associated Press Dispatch, 2nd)

### Molotov Receives Tatekawa

Temporary Fisheries Agreement Extended by Soviet Union

Moscow – Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Tatekawa today to discuss the extension of the term of the temporary Japan-Soviet fisheries agreement. (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)

It is said that the Japanese side had consulted with the Soviet authorities several times on this issue, intending to renegotiate a new agreement. The length of the Soviet Union's extension of the agreement this time is not yet known. (Associated Press Dispatch, 1st)

### Roosevelt Announces the Dispatch of Hopkins as Representative to Britain; Selection of U.S. Ambassador to Britain to Be Submitted to the Senate Next Week

Washington – President Roosevelt disclosed yesterday that he will soon send former Commerce Secretary Hopkins to Britain as his personal representative until a new ambassador to Britain is appointed. Hopkins has no official status in Britain and no position outside of Britain. Hopkins's role in Britain is simply to maintain contact between him and the British government. The President also stated that he intends to submit the name of the new ambassador to Britain to the Senate next week. The President's sudden announcement of Hopkins as his personal representative to Britain was unexpected by people in Washington and has aroused various speculations. No one is closer to President Roosevelt than Mr. Hopkins. Therefore, Hopkins can accurately convey the President's position to British Prime Minister Churchill. With 3,000 miles of ocean separating the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister, there is probably no one other than Hopkins who can bring the two sides closer together. The President's statement that he intends to submit the name of the new ambassador to Britain to the Senate next week has also aroused speculation, but nothing is known about who the new ambassador will be. (Reuters Dispatch, 4th)

London – News that former U.S. Commerce Secretary Hopkins has been appointed as Roosevelt's personal envoy to Britain was received with great joy. An official commented yesterday that the significance of this move "is only less than that of President Roosevelt arriving in London himself." (Associated Press Dispatch, 4th)

### Grew to Return Home Soon to Report on U.S.-Japan Relations

Washington – According to news yesterday, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew will return to the U.S. soon to report to President Roosevelt on the current state of U.S.-Japan relations. (Associated Press Dispatch, 3rd)

U.S. Newspaper Criticizes Matsuoka's Speech

Washington – Yesterday, all newspapers here carried the New Year's speeches of various countries' leaders. The one that provoked the most unsatisfactory criticism was the remarks of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka. A prominent commentator, referring to Matsuoka's pessimism about 1941, said that Matsuoka's reasons for this pessimism are certainly valid, because according to news from Berlin, the role of Japan in the world war is to guard against the United States. Matsuoka said that 1941 is the first year of the decline of the new personality. This statement is wrong, because this decline began in 1931, when Japan forcibly seized China's Northeast. As for peace, what Matsuoka knows is only the peace brought about by conquest and tyranny. Matsuoka also mentioned countries with small populations and countries with large populations. According to Matsuoka's view, 70 million Japanese are a majority people above 130 million Americans and 400 million Chinese. If Japan's new order is to allow the people and nations of each country to develop their future, why does Japan alone not allow China to develop its future independently? It can now be asserted that Matsuoka's repeated speeches have never done anything to improve U.S.-Japan relations, but have only made U.S.-Japan relations worse.

Chongqing Broadcast Delights the U.S. Side

The U.S. heard the Chongqing New Year broadcast with great delight. All newspapers carried it in prominent positions, and commented on China's need for war materials with sympathetic tones. The New York Times said that it is unfortunate that there are not enough aircraft being transported to China at this time. China had long requested these kinds of war materials to cope with the Japanese bombers that rain down bombs, bombarding undefended Chinese cities, and terrorizing civilians. Some types of aircraft suitable for this purpose should soon be available to meet China's needs. Japan's fighting power has been greatly weakened by China's staunch resistance. If China obtains a little assistance, Japan's threat to Vietnam, Singapore, Burma, and Soviet India will ultimately become a mirage. (Reuters News Agency, 3rd)

### The Success and Failure of Banquets

In social circles, holding banquets is a very common occurrence, whether at home or in restaurants. Indeed, the socializing at banquets can allow us to make many friends and engage in social life.

Before holding a banquet, there are many things to do. First, we must choose the location. If our home is reasonably clean and tidy, then it can be held at home, which is not only cheaper but also makes the guests feel more comfortable.

Second, we must determine the list of invitees several days in advance. Send out the invitations, and at the same time, we must decide whether it will be a tea party, a luncheon, or a dinner party.

On the day of the banquet, it is best to notify each invited person to ensure that they can attend. Then, preparations should be made for various arrangements, such as [blanks in original], decorations, and entertainment for the guests.

If we are hosting a banquet, we must ensure that every guest leaves feeling satisfied. This requires ample and active spirits. During the meal, fluent and lively conversation can often greatly enhance the banquet. We must speak clearly and listen carefully; these two points require a lot of energy.

After the meal, each guest must have adequate entertainment, such as a mahjong table, a game of chess, or the provision of interesting books, turning on the radio, or playing other musical instruments.

In short, the success or failure of a banquet depends on the host's attentive hospitality and the guests' pleasant attitude.

If we are suffering from a headache, toothache, rheumatism, or menstrual pain, we cannot make the banquet a success.

If we take some bad painkillers for emergency relief and later experience a reaction, what will happen?

This problem is easily solved. The simplest and safest pain relief method is to take Saridon. Swallow one or two tablets, and the pain will stop within ten minutes. No matter how severe the pain, it can be stopped, and because it is mild and peaceful, there are no aftereffects.

Saridon is manufactured by Roche Ltd. in Switzerland. The products manufactured by this company are very reliable, so when you experience pain, you can use Saridon to solve the problem.

### New Year's Charity Football: China United Loses to Western United: 2-5, First Half 1-4, Over 10,000 Fans Greatly Disappointed

In the McClay Engineer Cup Charity Football Tournament, China United played against Western United at Yiyuan at 2:30 pm on the 2nd. The audience reached more than 16,000 people. The lineup of the China United team remained unchanged, while Western United's goalkeeper Willie Water and left winger Jem Water were absent. Therefore, M. Su Ruo filled in as a fighter, Simmons was transferred to the left wing, and Xisuo's vacancy was filled by Xue Gelun. In the first half, Western United took the lead with a goal by Xue Gelun.

Li pulled up and kicked the ball, which flew into the net, clear and beautiful, and cheers rang out, leveling the score. Unexpectedly, within a minute, Western United's center Gains got a pass from Simmons and shot hard, scoring. Western United took the lead again.

### Paramount: Loses to McClay Officers, Shangxing Loses to Little Bears by One Point

In the Qing Basketball game the night before last (3rd), the game between Shangxing and Little Bears was extremely tense. In the first half, the Little Bears led by 10-12. After the break, Shangxing's offense and defense were excellent, and the score soared. In the end, due to more points lost in the first half, they lost to the Little Bears by a score of 26-27, a difference of one point. In another game, McClay Officers vs. Paramount, the game was one-sided. McClay Officers won by 57-41. The game between Huaxing and McClay White, which was originally scheduled for the night before last, was postponed to the 17th due to Huaxing's request for a change of date. It is said that Huaxing has many famous players from North China who will come to Shanghai to help out soon, and their strength will be further strengthened.

### Food: Rice Prices Continue to Rise Relentlessly, Chinese Goods Have Reached Peak Prices, Inferior Goods Follow Closely Behind, Japonica Rice Has Reached a New High of 104 Yuan

During the New Year holiday, a large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. It is estimated that on the 1st, the Yihua Shipping Company's Fusheng wheel transported 1,989 bags from Hong Kong. On the 2nd, the Yihua Shipping Company's Mingsheng wheel loaded 1,335 bags from Hong Kong. On the same day, the Taikoo Company's Hunan wheel loaded 8,342 bags from Hong Kong. On the 3rd, the Yihua Shipping Company's Risheng wheel transported 1,148 bags from Hong Kong, and the Taikoo Company's Suzhou wheel loaded 1,936 bags from Hong Kong. The five wheels loaded a total of 14,750 bags. The Yihua Shipping Company's wheels stopped at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload, and the Taikoo Company's wheels stopped at the Bund Wharf outside the French Concession to unload. (Zu)

After the foreign rice market opened on the 3rd, the spot price had already risen by one yuan. On the 4th, it rose by another yuan. In two days, it was already two or three yuan higher than at the end of the year. The rumors in the market stimulated buyers, and the hoarders secretly raised prices, which made the sellers hoard and manipulate prices, resulting in rice prices rising steadily. Chinese goods have reached their peak, and lower grades are also rising. Special and high-priced goods in the market are being sold secretly at discounted prices. After many days of price suppression at the end of the year, prices have risen again in these two days, and large merchants are unwilling to sell easily due to high costs. It is really unknown how high the prices will rise. However, the futures market was also fiercely shouting high at first, and then the Da Fu foreign firm offered to sell February small-grain rice at the original price of 84.8 yuan, without quantity limits. The people's hearts calmed down, and the price was similar to the previous opening price. The estimated prices are 86 yuan for January small-grain, 84.78 yuan to 85 yuan for February, and 94.5 yuan for December 9th, which is more popular than similar spot prices. On the 3rd and 4th, the daily turnover of spot goods was 7,000 to 8,000 bags, and the futures turnover was less than 1,000 tons for two days.

The market opened yesterday morning, continuing the previous day's aftershocks, and continued to rise, and the situation was more solid than the first session. Transactions were extremely active, and high-priced goods were mostly unwilling to sell easily, and rarely displayed samples. Most of those that were opened were middlemen goods. For example, secondary fire-grain opened at 85.5 yuan, 85 yuan, small-grain at 79 yuan, Mi Lu at 78 yuan, 77 yuan, broken-tip at 76 yuan, secondary to Lei Xi at 71 yuan, and Tokyo grind-tip at 79 yuan. The surface of the price competition seemed to have little ups and downs, but in terms of product differences, it actually rose by more than a yuan secretly. High-priced goods were not restricted. No. 1 Siam opened at 89 yuan, and Annam special japonica at 94.5 yuan. As for No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon, although they seemed to open at the limited prices of 87 yuan for No. 1 and 81.5 yuan for No. 2, most of them were sold together with unrestricted secondary goods, and there were rumors of secret transactions in violation of regulations, with No. 1 sold at 91-92 yuan and No. 2 red-grain pagoda discounted at 500 yuan per hundred bags. Therefore, individuals who knew the stakes strictly kept secrets, and documentary evidence such as transaction orders avoided writing, for fear of leaving traces. Therefore, they avoided signing contracts and only saw whispering and muttered transactions, hastily concluded, and secretly refused to announce, so it was impossible to inquire and difficult to obtain evidence.

Although the source of thick and thin japonica and other national rice has long been rumored to be normally dredged from January onwards, it has not yet been implemented, so there are still very few arrivals. At present, in terms of sales, because the general bourgeoisie prepares New Year rice every year, they often accumulate a lot. Therefore, stores are very popular to meet door sales, and there is a general situation of supply exceeding demand for a while. As things are rare, prices continued to rise by more than two yuan. Qingjiao Dou saw 97.5 yuan for thin rice, and Kunshan Dou saw 104 yuan to 102 yuan for white japonica, and the original package reached 110 yuan.

Whether it is domestic or foreign goods, glutinous rice sales are inferior and difficult to compete with other goods. Moreover, those who hoard goods think there is no hope and feel that sales are stagnant, and they are willing to devalue and sell quickly, so the selling price is actually shorter than last year by a yuan or so. Yiao yuan only opened at 92-93 yuan, 90 yuan, Hong Kong white yuan at 83 yuan, secondary to 79 yuan.

### Starch Flour Supply Stopped, Foreign Flour Takes the Opportunity to Control the Market, Market Price Increases Are Particularly Strong

Yesterday was the opening day after the New Year holiday for various industries and markets. There were no significant changes, but the price increase of flour was particularly strong. This is because the Chinese factories have stopped supplying flat-selling flour due to a shortage of raw materials. Although it is in a discussion period, there is no new method to implement. The street's daily consumption is at least 7,000 to 8,000 bags, so people are panicked, and flour shops are rushing to purchase. In general, those who hold goods take this opportunity to hoard and manipulate prices, and foreign flour is not like domestic flour. It is all in the hands of retail investors, and once controlled, there is no goods to buy. Therefore, the market price increase is particularly strong. Clock Tower Flower and Black O'Fen is the most popular in the sales market. The opening price rose to 24 yuan and then rose to 24.45 yuan. Wild Boar brand was 24.7 yuan to 7.5 yuan. More than 20,000 bags were transacted, all of which were handled by retail customers.

The wheat market situation is unusually tight. Because the source has been scarce for a long time, and in the midst of the skyrocketing prices of foreign flour, sellers are becoming more and more quiet, so the market price is surprisingly high, and the factory wants to buy but has no goods. The result is still in a state of firm rejection.

### Economic Essays

— Feng Liutang

Diamond

Diamonds have become the most noble and most showy ornaments for ladies. They are most often used in rings, and it is not surprising that the wealthy use them for various decorations.

The reason why diamonds are valuable is that they are hard, so the Chinese call them "Jin Gang," which is the most appropriate. They are not called stones, but "diamonds," which is a metaphor for their ability to overcome hardness. Secondly, they have strong reflection. Diamonds are originally octahedral, hexahedral, or rhombic dodecahedral crystals, which are rich in reflection. Once polished, they exhibit total reflection. Therefore, diamonds are often seen shining with light and are extraordinarily luxurious. In the late Guangxu years, I was studying at Zhejiang High School in Hangzhou. At that time, there was a lack of materials for natural history (zoology and botany) teachers, so we had to borrow materials from other places. At that time, the teacher who taught us was Mr. Suzuki Kameju, a Japanese. When he taught geology and mineralogy, he also taught us a table of mineral hardness, divided into ten grades, with diamonds being the hardest. He also made two mnemonic phrases so that we could practice reciting them. I have been able to remember them to this day and can still quote them. The phrases are:

Talc Fang Xi Fluorine Phosphorus Long,

Water Yellow Steel Xi Jin Yu Huang;

"Hua" refers to talc, which is the mineral with the lowest hardness. "Shi" is quartz, "Fang" is calcite, "Ying" is fluorite, "Lin" is apatite, "Chang" is feldspar, "Shui" is crystal, "Huang" is topaz, "Tong" is copper jade, and "Jin" is diamond. These are the standard products for ten kinds of hardness. It is said that the weakest minerals can be scratched with fingernails, and the hardest, such as diamonds, can only be polished with fine fragments of diamonds. Approximately, feldspar and other minerals with hardness below can be used with steel, and those above, such as crystals, must be drilled. The hardness of glass is the same as that of crystal, so it must be divided with a diamond.

The term "diamond" appears in Chinese books, as far as I know, in the Ming Dynasty. At that time, various countries in the Western Regions, such as Hami Uyghur, Turpan, Lumei, and Tianfang, all had diamonds in their tributes. In the early Qing Dynasty, the tributes from Turpan even included 2,000 catties of jade and two taels of diamonds. From this, it can be seen that China's diamonds all came from the Western Regions. In fact, they were not produced in the Western Regions, but at that time, China's trade with various Western countries all used Central Asian countries as their transit hubs. Therefore, in old Chinese books, the transactions of rare and exotic objects and the identification of treasures often referred to merchants from the Western Regions, and even called them "treasure-recognizing princes," for this reason.

The places of origin of diamonds are South Africa and the Belgian Congo, all of which are products of the pyroclastic breccia in the Kimberley volcano. In the eleventh year of Tongzhi, the Shenbao had a diamond examination, which was seen in the "New Copy of Old Newspapers in Sixty-Seven Years" in the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China. The method of distinguishing the true from the false mentioned is not scientific, but it is worth treasuring because it was said before sixty-seven years:

"Western countries value diamonds the most. The large ones are used by monarchs as ornaments, worth hundreds of millions, and the small ones are used to decorate finger rings: but there are true and false ones. The false ones are called water iron, and are counterfeited with crystal. There are two ways to distinguish between true and false: one is to try it with glass. The true one will scratch the glass, leaving a trace, and the false one will not. The same is true when testing on porcelain. The other is to put it in charcoal fire and burn it red, and then immerse it in sour vinegar. The true one will remain hard, and the false one will be brittle."

There is also a saying for calling it "diamond":

"Because it can drill holes in porcelain, it is called a diamond. Today, it is used by those who nail broken bowls, and those who engrave jade seals and crystal seals. It is unbreakable, and if it hits iron, the iron will be damaged. In the past, there were those who held false relics that could not be broken by gold or iron, but they were broken immediately by a diamond. The false relics were made of antelope horn, and only a diamond can break antelope horn. To engrave jade seals and gold seals with a diamond, an iron tube must be used, like a pen tube. The head is branched, and the diamond is clamped and engraved. However, attacking hard with hard cannot immediately penetrate deep. At first, there are only fine traces, and then gradually deeper, which takes a lot of wrist strength. And if it is used for a long time, the edge will be slightly blunt, and its hardness cannot be ground on a stone. There is only one wonderful method to sharpen the edge by burning it in the lamp fire. However, if it is burned repeatedly, it will gradually become smaller, the clamp will loosen and it will easily fall to the ground, and the object is small and difficult to find. The method of finding it is to sweep the ash and soil on the ground into the milk and pound it. If there is a sound, you will find it."

However, the source of the diamond is said to be

"It comes out of the stone or out of the eagle's dung. I have extensively examined the records, and I think the saying of the eagle's dung is correct."

This seems bizarre when compared with modern sayings. In fact, it is not surprising, because at that time, Chinese people were quite isolated from overseas affairs, and being able to say that it came out of "eagle's dung" is not consistent, but the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa is a gathering place for migratory birds. Every winter, groups of birds use this as a place to shelter from the cold, so bird droppings are also a specialty of the area. It happens that diamonds are also produced, so it is mistakenly thought to be produced in eagle dung. However, saying "the saying of eagle dung is correct" is inevitably close to conjecture.

The scientific method used to identify diamonds is in the sixth volume, seventh issue of Scientific Pictorial, which can be used for explanation:

"The methods used to identify diamonds are to test their insolubility in hydrofluoric acetic acid, their hardness, density, refractive index, and combustibility in oxygen. Hydrofluoric acid can dissolve most substances, but it cannot dissolve diamonds. The hardness of diamonds is the highest of all substances, so you can rub them against silicon carbide crystals (Carborundum) to test their hardness. The density of diamonds (3.15) is equal to that of methylene iodide, so you can put diamonds in methylene iodide to test their density, because true diamonds can be suspended in methylene iodide. At 800 degrees Celsius, diamonds can burn in oxygen."

But ordinary general discrimination can only be (1) left to the experience of each individual. The tools they use are a pair of stamps and a small microscope. (2) The color, with pink and white being the most expensive, and brown-gray and yellow being cheaper. (3) Look at whether the "flip head" is sufficient. The so-called "flip head" is the refractive index; and the degree of transparency.

As for the price, in addition to color, the size of the particles (that is, the weight) is also a major condition. The weight of diamonds is calculated in carats (Carat, also written as Karat). The increase in price is proportional to the square of the increase in size. For example, if the price of one carat is 300 yuan, the price of two carats should be 1,200 yuan.

The carat is a unit of weight for diamonds, equal to 205 milligrams (Milligrame, formerly written as 兞), approximately equal to 5.5 haos of the old Kuping tael, and 6.4 haos of the market tael. But it is internationally used, and some are made as 200 milligrams.

The black diamonds produced in Brazil are usually in the form of round grains and can only be used for polishing and diamond drills. In addition, artificial diamonds are being tested, but there is no great achievement yet. It is said that they are made of pure iron filings and sugar carbon, with high heat and high pressure. Although the yield is still small, the test results are indeed pure and transparent high-quality diamonds. (See the article on artificial diamonds in the sixth volume, seventh issue of Science Magazine.

It was rare in the past to see Shanghai ladies wearing diamond rings, but it was common for wealthy families and entertainers to show off. Before the war, small diamond rings were quite popular, but after the Shanghai war broke out, prices of everything soared, people's livelihood became difficult, and it was not easy to purchase them. Even if they had them, they did not dare to wear them easily.

Finally, I would like to introduce a piece of the largest diamond in the modern world to the readers. This is reprinted from the eighth issue of the seventh volume of Scientific Pictorial:

"President Vargas" gemstone, said to be the largest uncut diamond in the modern world, weighing 726.60 carats, has been sent from Amsterdam to the United States and is owned by the United States. If the gemstone were placed on an ordinary jeweler's scale, it would weigh about 5 and a quarter ounces. The diamond is two and a half inches long, two inches wide, and one inch thick, with a light blue color. When the stone is polished, its value is $750,000 (equivalent to 12,750,000 yuan at the current black market exchange rate). According to the largest diamond in the world, weighing 3,000 carats, called Cullinan, it has been cut into nine large diamonds. The largest one is called "Star of South Africa," weighing 530 carats, all owned by the British royal family."

### Finance Foreign Exchange: Many Sell Short Positions

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: the HSBC listed prices remained unchanged. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, yesterday was the first trading day of the year for banks, and it also happened to be a Saturday. There was no market in the afternoon, and it passed quietly. Speculators tended to sell, and exporters also sold, indicating a potentially firm trend. However, Sassoon & Co. came to buy, and the Chinese banks resumed taking deposits, which adequately offset the sales. Therefore, there were very few changes at noon. As a result, the spot price of British gold was 3 shillings and 3.5 pence, and the US dollar was 5.53125 yuan, slightly looser than before the holiday by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively. Futures were still slightly higher.

Exporters Followed Suit in Selling

In the early morning, the London cable rate for both near and far terms increased by 125. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price was stable. The exchange rate between British and American currencies and Shanghai currencies remained unchanged. The exchange rate between American and British currencies increased by 25, but there was no change against Shanghai currency. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with a spot selling price in the morning of 3 shillings and 3.5 pence for British gold and 5.5 yuan for British exchange, which was 0.015625 yuan higher for the US dollar and firmer for the British pound compared to the final closing price before the holiday year-end. Shortly after opening, Chinese banks all wanted to sell short positions, but with a lack of buyers, the price relaxed considerably. One American bank absorbed spot US dollars from Chinese banks at a rate of 5.5625 yuan. Exporters also followed suit in selling, initially offering three shillings and 515625 pence for this month. The HSBC listed prices were announced, with no changes in any exchange rates. The silver balancing tax increased by 1.00%. After that, Chinese speculators sold to Sassoon & Co., Chinese mainland banks, etc., this month's US dollar at 5.53125 yuan. Extending to noon, the supply and demand were still balanced, and the market closed quietly at noon. As a result, the spot and this month's British gold were at 3 shillings and 3.5 pence, and the US dollar was at 5.53125 yuan. Next month's British gold was at 3 shillings and 484375 pence, and the US dollar was at 5.5 yuan. Compared to the closing price before the holiday (Tuesday), the central gold price increased by 0.015625 yuan, and the US dollar loosened by 0.03125 yuan.

### In a Scattered Buying Spree, the Gold Market Remains High

Yesterday's Shanghai unofficial gold market, the Lunar New Year holiday has passed, and the market opened as usual. It happened to be a Saturday, and furthermore, Chinese banks and money exchanges in the city have changed their business hours from this year onwards, only operating for half a day on Saturday mornings and closing in the afternoon. Therefore, for the convenience of clearing notes, gold businesses temporarily agreed to close at 11:00 AM, one hour earlier. Thus, yesterday only had one hour and forty-five minutes of business. The situation was stable and firm, and the price had risen above the 6,500 yuan mark. The red opening indicates that most people are optimistic, leading to a scattered buying spree. In a moment after the morning opening, the price rose to a high of 6,550 yuan. Midway, due to the strength of the foreign exchange rate, cash houses and securities firms competed to sell, briefly pulling the price back to 6,480 yuan. However, it soon rose again under the enthusiastic buying pressure, finally settling up 32 yuan to 6,512 yuan. Based on the closing price of the one-month US dollar at 5.5 yuan, it was 6,352 yuan, a difference of 160 yuan. A total of about 4,000 taels were traded in half a day. There were rumors of cash rice trading, with the price about only 30 yuan different from the futures price, and the gap continued to narrow. The price of ornamental gold remained unchanged.

Shanghai Gold Higher by More Than Thirty Yuan

Since the market opened at 9:15 AM, with each bar (ten taels), the price had risen to the 6,500 yuan mark under buying pressure, 20 yuan higher than the noon closing price before the holiday (31st). At that time, people were unanimously optimistic, and money exchanges and banks competed to buy, and it continued to fly up by 50 yuan, rising to 6,550 yuan in a moment. However, the foreign exchange rate strengthened, and US dollars could only be sold at 5.5625 yuan. Cash houses, securities firms, bank draft merchants competed to sell, and scattered sales led to tilting, and the price gradually fell, retracting 70 yuan, fluctuating slightly around 6,500 yuan. The lowest was 6,480 yuan. Gold houses, banks, and certain banks came to buy again one after another. Floating accounts were mostly long positions, and they lifted the price strongly twice, rising to 6,535 yuan again. Finally, due to the relaxation of the foreign exchange rate, the price could not be sustained for long and retreated again to 6,505 yuan. The closing price at 11:00 AM was 6,512 yuan, up 32 yuan from the noon closing before the holiday (31st). After the closing, it was 6,518 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 70 yuan in half a day. The capital gold of cash houses, the selling price in the fighting market, was 10 yuan lower than the futures price, and the purchase price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for spot gold.

Ornamental Gold Still Unchanged

The selling price of gold for jewelry per tael in silver shops, both Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang remained unchanged, still listed at 660 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan, it is said.

### US Dollar Initially High, Then Fell

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the Shanghai market price, although slightly increased on the surface, was still slightly lower than the off-market transaction price in the afternoon on Tuesday. Therefore, British and American gold pounds, the final prices remained the same, and British gold notes remained stable as before, and the market price remained flat. The US dollar notes initially rose to 18.33 yuan, then gradually retreated to 0.15 yuan, and finally ended at 18.2 yuan, falling 0.1 yuan from the previous holiday. Hong Kong notes were still in demand, and the market price rose slightly. The demand for Japanese gold notes was strong, and the evening market price was high at 1.625 yuan. Korean notes, however, continued to soften in the market price due to a constant supply, and the evening market retreated to 1.25 yuan.

### Three Bank Offices Opened Yesterday

Yesterday, three bank offices opened in the city, two on Jing'an Temple Road: one was the Shanghai branch office of the Central Bank, and the other was the Juxingcheng Bank. In addition, there was one on Foch Road, namely the Xinhua Bank office.

### New Fractional Currency Notes Issued by Zhejiang Local Bank

Recently, the Zhejiang Local Bank specially issued three types of fractional currency notes: 1-fen, 2-fen, and 5-fen, to regulate the shortage of subsidiary currency in the province. They are uniformly used within the province. These fractional notes are small and exquisite, with the words "Zhejiang Local Bank" and "1 fen, 2 fen, 5 fen" on the front, and the number on the back. The 1-fen note is green, the 2-fen note is blue, and the 5-fen note is red. We have specially made a plate for them below. However, they are about the same size as public debt interest coupons. Once used, they will definitely shrink further due to kneading. The smaller the note, the easier it is to lose, which is also worth noting.

### Securities: Four Types of Public Bonds All Reached New High Prices

The unofficial market for public bonds opened as usual yesterday. As it was a Saturday, it only did half a day of business. Trading was still quite lively, and the market was extremely firm. All four types, A, B, C, and D, reached new high prices, the highest record not seen since August 13th. Although Type E did not reach a new high price, it was only 0.1 yuan away from the highest record because it was right after the lottery draw. The situation is extremely favorable. In the current extremely favorable environment, the upward trend may still be in full swing. Yesterday's trend was that the market price gradually rose with Lianyi, Tongshen, Yongkang, Xinfu, and other firms gradually buying. Although Runli had a large number of sales, the market price was still extremely firm. After entering, Zhongyi, Dingkang, Juxin slightly sold, and Shuntai and Lianhe bought at the low price, and the market price slightly returned by about 0.1 yuan, but it was still a new high closing price. As a result, all rose by 0.25 to 0.65 yuan, with a turnover of about one million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

For stock trading, 500 shares of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 9.6 yuan, which was 0.35 yuan higher than before.

London, 3rd (Friday) telegram: Today's listed market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks, British stocks saw a slight pullback. The HSBC Bank British-registered stock fell by £2 to £75. Hong Kong-registered stock remained at the original price. Gula Ke Lin Rubber stock fell by 7.5 pence to 15 shillings and 7.5 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn & Cotton: After the Weekend, Silver and Money Exchanges Close, Yarn Market is First Affected, Transactions are Clear and Delivery is Done on Alternate Days, Demand for Single Yarn Improves, Market Price Increases

Yesterday, the yarn market after the holiday started as usual with a red opening, but the market situation remained stable. As for actual transactions, although there was no large-scale development, the demand for 32-count single yarn continued to improve, so the selling price alone increased and people's hearts were still calm. However, the market turnover was very small. This is because, from this year onwards, silver and money exchanges stop operating in the afternoon on weekends. If both the buying and selling parties trade, both parties cannot clear payments in time. Therefore, most of the business done is at the price for delivery on Monday. Today, 465 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuang Ma opened in the morning because the atmosphere was enthusiastic after New Year's Eve last year, and the asking price was already high. Before the market opened, most people were bullish. Unexpectedly, the financial industry was closed in the afternoon on weekends, and the silver and money could not be paid and received in time. Everyone held each other for a long time. At 9:30 AM, the foreign exchange market opened without changes, and the price of gold was also flat before the opening price was made. Most of the deliveries were scheduled for Monday. The opening price was 1,384 yuan for same-day delivery, and then 1,388-9 yuan for delivery on Monday. In a moment, the foreign exchange rate increased by 0.03125, and the market suddenly loosened, falling by 10 yuan to 1,377 yuan. However, small silver houses bought slightly, returning to 1,383-4 yuan. This market hovered for a long time, and the closing price was 1,382 yuan. According to the statistics of transactions during the day, 4,730 bales were traded, and the market rose by 7 yuan. The amounts bought by each gang are listed below:

Same Industry: 4,350 Hong Kong: 380 Statistics: 4,730

### The Cotton Market is Very Lackluster

The current cotton situation is bleak and dark. This is because overseas routes are operating as usual, and the price of Indian cotton is 20-30 yuan cheaper than the price in Shanghai. Therefore, people's hearts cannot be raised high. However, the people who purchase and order it bear a lot of risks, so the cotton price is not as brisk as the yarn market, which is the biggest factor.

Another report: The market price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market fell yesterday due to mass selling, and then the closing price rose one or two pounds due to the high price of Wall Street stocks and purchases by some industry peers. The Indian market situation was flat.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. All parties have no intention to buy or sell, because the yarn sales are sluggish. However, according to the current situation, the future of the cotton market is brighter than that of the yarn market.

Soybeans were weak due to the continued source, but were able to stand under the support of hoarders. Three thousand five hundred to six hundred packages of various beans were traded.

### Rice Market Raised Prices Again Yesterday, Thorough Investigation and Handling Initiated, Rice Merchants Trading Beyond Limits Were Arrested, Cheap Rice Sale Will Be Held the Day After Tomorrow at Two Sheng Per Yuan, Public Warehouse Food Storage Will Raise Enough Funds for 20 Million Yuan

Regarding the problem of the people's food in this city, in the past, due to rice profiteers making trouble in the middle and hoarding goods to raise prices, the market was chaotic, and the situation became serious. Since the authorities strictly formulated methods and resolutely implemented them, recently 200,000 bags of tribute rice arrived in Shanghai to provide relief, so there is no need to worry about shortages. By the first month of the lunar calendar, Yangon rice will arrive in Shanghai. In February, the public warehouse food storage method will be implemented, and the city will have 200,000 bags of foreign rice stored permanently, which will be sold at low prices at any time and ordered from foreign countries at any time to make up for this number. The serious problem of the people's food in this city can be said to have passed. As for public warehouse food storage, it is said that the banking community has also supported and participated, and its strength has become more solid. It will raise enough funds for 20 million yuan to handle this matter. As for the rice market, after opening yesterday morning, it became tight again, and rice profiteers continued to make trouble and harm society. A thorough investigation is underway, and when necessary, the original price of rice stored in the city will be thoroughly investigated to be used as a basis for verification and handling.

Increase Arrests, Monitor Markets

The Public Concession authorities, the original intention of initially allowing rice merchants to set up rice markets at Qinglian Pavilion on Fuzhou Road, was to facilitate the buying and selling of the traveling merchant shops. Unexpectedly, rumors have spread to this day, giving the place to profiteers to use as a speculation market. Now, in order to thoroughly monitor business operations, the detectives stationed in the rice market have been increased from 22 to 6 people to secretly investigate market business. Those who conduct illegal transactions beyond the limited price will be arrested and dealt with according to the law.

Bribing Beyond Limits, Arrested and Tried

Although the transportation of rice in this city has been slightly difficult after the war, the source is still constantly flowing. However, the general heartless profiteers, regardless of the people's livelihood, only know how to enrich themselves and hoard and hoard, causing rice prices to skyrocket, and white glutinous rice has once surpassed the 100 yuan mark. Small people in the lower classes are the first to suffer, so they are forced to take risks and become thieves. The insecurity of the public order is indirectly caused by such rice profiteers. The Public Concession Board and rice industry groups have repeatedly stipulated the current price and strictly implemented it, but they are regarded as a dead letter and are obeyed in appearance but violated in reality, so although there is a limited price, it is still difficult to stop the rise in rice prices. At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, Hua detective Mao Guobao and detective Li Bijun, stationed by the Political Department of the Public Concession Patrol Force in the rice market of Qinglian Pavilion on Fuzhou Road, discovered that Zhang Shengtao, an employee of the Wanshengtai rice shop at No. 52 Mao Yili, Shanhai Pass Road, sold 40 bags of rice (calculated as 50 stone) at 79.7 yuan to Tan Mingde, a representative of the Songshunxieji rice shop at No. 94 Henan Road. The detectives and others believed that the limited price of the small glutinous rice was 79 yuan per stone. Since it has now exceeded the limited price, in order to enforce the law, they arrested the two people and took them to the Laozha Patrol Station. On the way, Zhang and Tan dared to bribe the detectives with 300 yuan, hoping to be released, but the two detectives were deeply righteous and refused to accept the bribe. Yesterday morning, Zhang and Tan were sent to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Special Court to be sued for the high price exceeding the limit. Under the questioning of Judge Shen, he ordered them to be detained for another hearing at a later date. As for the bribing part, the original case will be sued separately after the over-limit part is convicted. At the same time, evidence will also be collected against those who hoard and hoard, and they will be sued according to the law, and the treacherous and evil will know to be vigilant and stabilize the price of the rice market.

Outline of Small Amount Collective Purchase Method

The Shanghai Food Grain Cooperation Association is actively soliciting basic ordinary members, and has designated Xinhua Bank and Tongrun Money Exchange as the association's collection offices. The meeting held a meeting of supervisors and directors on January 2 to exchange opinions. The method for collective purchasing rice is: (1) For those who commission from one to five bags of foreign rice, 20 yuan is collected in advance for each bag; for those who commission from six to twenty bags, 30 yuan is collected in advance for each bag; for those who commission more than 20 bags, 45 yuan is collected in advance for each bag. (2) Members who order food grains are required to pay a fund of 100 yuan for each bag of rice purchased by basic members, and ordinary members are exempt from paying for each bag of rice purchased. (3) If it is impossible to purchase food grains, the deposit will be refunded in full. (4) The deposit of foreign rice includes water, fire, and military insurance to prevent accidents. (5) The required expenses shall be borne equally by the purchasers. (6) After the symbol food grain arrives, the rice purchaser shall pay the balance of the price of the goods. (7) If it is not paid in full within the specified period, various additional expenses shall be borne.

Cheap Grain Sale Will Start the Day After Tomorrow

The cheap foreign rice sale organized by the Shanghai Cheap Grain Sale Committee, after the seventh phase ended on November 19th last year, the eighth phase has been decided to start on the 7th. The time is from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. Two sheng of rice will be sold per yuan, and each person is limited to one yuan. There are six cheap sale locations in the city (36 in the Public Concession and 24 in the French Concession). Half of them collect money and sell tickets, and half of them distribute rice with tickets. Each rice distribution location sells 50 bags of rice per day as a limit. It is learned that this cheap sale period is the last phase. It has not yet been decided whether to continue to run it in the future. The Rice Shop Association was entrusted by the Cheap Grain Sale Committee, and after a meeting, it was decided to recommend 60 members to be responsible for the cheap sales in the eighth phase, which is recorded as follows:

### Lunar New Year is Approaching Soon, Financial Situation is Becoming More Stable

Commercial Banks All Achieve Surplus in Closing Accounts, Annual General Closing on January 26

After the silver and money industry and various industries have handled the general closing of accounts for the Gregorian year of the Republic of China in 1929, they have all opened for business yesterday. At the same time, the New Year's holiday for various agencies and organizations has ended, and work has resumed. The markets for various firms and foreign exchange, gold, securities, and the silver and money industry are all closed for the afternoon due to the fact that it is a Saturday. The time for clearing bills in the silver and money industry has been advanced to 12:45 PM, and the time for collecting bills has also been advanced.

Bank Closing of Accounts

The closing of accounts for each bank has always been at the end of the Gregorian year. The business for the Republic of China in 1929 has been completed separately. According to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency who inquired in the banking industry, commercial banks that have their head offices in Shanghai have all achieved considerable surpluses in their business last year, ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to millions of yuan. However, each bank keeps it secret to the outside world. The method of reporting the amount of surplus to the Banking Association has been abolished this year. It is said that Shanghai, Zhejiang Xing, Zhejiang Shi, and the Four Bank Savings Associations have the most. As for the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture, because the head office has moved to Chongqing, Shanghai is only a branch, so the branch has telegraphed the business situation of last year to the head office.

Annual General Closing

The general closing for all industries for the Republic of China in 1929 has been decided to be January 26, and January 27 to 30 has been set as the general closing period, and the public is closed. Trading will be listed from January 31. Now that the general closing period is approaching in an instant, all factories, companies, and firms have already started preparing. The method for the silver and money industry to handle business around New Year's Eve and the general closing period has been determined by the Executive Committee on the 10th. The Shanghai financial market remains as stable as ever, the silver root is relaxed, and there is no tension. The foreign exchange black market has been maintained and is very stable. This year's finance is more stable than last year, so all industries can pass peacefully.

### New Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura Kichisaburō, Arrives in Shanghai

Japan Strictly Guarded and Blockaded All Bridges, Nomura Will Also Host Reporters in Shanghai

The new Japanese ambassador to the United States, Nomura, recently came to China. He was originally scheduled to fly from Ningbo to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 3rd (the day before yesterday). Presumably due to bad weather, he changed to arrive here by train at 12:30 PM yesterday (the 4th). Previously, the Japanese authorities closed all bridges on the Suzhou River leading to the northern district of the Public Concession, and only opened them after several hours. The Japanese authorities announced yesterday that, for the sake of continuing to take precautions during Nomura's stay in Shanghai, the Waibaidu Bridge, Zha Pu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge will be closed at the specified times in the next few days. According to what was learned yesterday morning, Nomura will only stay in Shanghai for two days, and will return to Japan on Monday. He is scheduled to depart from Japan on January 23 to take up his new post in Washington. It is expected that Nomura will visit foreign and Japanese officials before leaving Shanghai and will host foreign journalists. Yesterday afternoon, Nomura will meet with Japanese journalists on the Japanese warship Izumo, and the commander of the Third Japanese Fleet, Shimada, will also be present.

### Hong Kong Entry Regulations Will Be Implemented on a Fixed Date, Liners to Hong Kong Set Sail in Advance

The British authorities in Hong Kong previously issued regulations restricting the entry of the population, which were originally scheduled to be implemented last December, but were postponed to the 14th of this month. However, Hong Kong and Shanghai shipping companies requested to release the entry and exit passes during the period of the Lunar New Year, which is more frequent than usual, so they again submitted a request to the Hong Kong authorities to postpone the period. According to what a reporter from Pingming News Agency learned from the authoritative sources in the shipping industry, the Hong Kong authorities, after considering the request of the shipping companies, found it difficult to approve it and decided to implement it on the 14th of this month. The shipping companies in this city have now decided to advance the sailing schedules of each ship sailing to Hong Kong as much as time allows, so that they can arrive in Hong Kong before the 14th of this month.

### French Sailors Head to Hong Kong on New Year's Day to Join the Free French Forces; French Consul General Majella Denies It; Some French Residents in Shanghai Also Head to Hong Kong to Enlist

The "Continental News" reports that the French Lines passenger ship "D'Artagnan," originally scheduled to leave Shanghai last week, was delayed until Thursday because 26 crew members abandoned the ship on New Year's Day to travel to Hong Kong on the "Taiyuan" steamer to participate in General Catroux's movement and fight for Free France. The "D'Artagnan" did not call at Hong Kong on its way to Shanghai from Saigon,

For fear of being detained

and handed over to Free France. The Shanghai "Times" reports that the French Consul General in Shanghai, Majella, (on the 3rd yesterday) officially denied the claim that 26 crew members of the "D'Artagnan" had left the ship and gone to Hong Kong to join the French forces under Catroux. It is true that the "D'Artagnan" did not dock in Hong Kong on its way to Shanghai, but this can be considered a standard practice because the French Lines ships that sail between Vietnam and Shanghai

Only stop

at Manila. Although the French consul denied it, informed sources in the French community in Shanghai believe that it is true that some French sailors have left the ship, but the number is small. They were seeking higher-paying jobs and therefore abandoned their old ones. It is also heard that some French residents in Shanghai left Shanghai on New Year's Day to go to Hong Kong to enlist in the Free French forces and serve their country.

### Under Ivanoff's Dictatorship: The Fate of White Russians

Forcible Collection of Income Tax and Control of Various Organizations Since Ivanoff was appointed chairman of the local White Russian Immigrant Committee after the assassination of Mezhlauk in Meizi Le, he has held special power and is the dictator of the 30,000 White Russians in Shanghai. First, under the guise of running welfare projects, he forcibly collected White Russian income tax starting in November last year, with a monthly income of about 8,000 yuan, and plans to control all White Russian organizations in Shanghai starting this year. The first to be affected are the two hospitals established by the Russian Orthodox Church, one on Zhao Zhujiao Road and one on Shanzhong Road, which have been taken over by Ivanoff a few days ago. The French Concession Health Department has also reached an agreement with Ivanoff to subsidize the hospital at the end of each year.

### All Staff of the Tushanwan Orphanage Go on Strike, Making Ten Demands for Improved Treatment; Negotiations Failed to Resolve the Issue Yesterday Morning

Over 1,000 workers (including over 600 apprentices in the orphanage) at the Tushanwan Orphanage established by the Jesuit Catholic Church in Xujiahui, requested improved treatment from Director Lu around the 20th of last month. The workers' wages before the war were 70 cents per person per day (without board and lodging), and are now 1.30 yuan. In addition, the orphanage subsidizes 4.50 yuan for rice, which is not enough to maintain a living. At that time, the workers made ten demands: (1) Each adult to receive 2 dou of rice and each child 1 dou. (2) Each person to receive 1 dan of coal briquettes. (3) Workers on sick leave to receive full wages and medical expenses. (4) Wages to be paid during holidays. (5) Marriage and funeral leave: two weeks in Shanghai, four weeks outside Shanghai, with wages paid. (6) Double pay at the end of the year as usual. (7) Workers not to be dismissed without cause. (8) Wages to be paid during strikes. (9) Workers dismissed before one year to receive six months' wages; after one year, one month more to be added for each additional year; rice subsidies to continue for six months. (10) Food prices for hospitalized workers to remain at pre-war levels. The orphanage received the above demands but did not respond. Therefore, at 8:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, about 20 workers from the distribution department, 90 from the printing department, and over 70 from the copper workshop, a total of about 200 people, first went on a slowdown. By 7:00 AM yesterday morning, 80 workers from the carpentry workshop and 40 from the painting workshop also joined the slowdown, causing the labor unrest to suddenly escalate. Father Yao Zantang of the Xujiahui Catholic Church heard the news and offered to mediate, and agreed that both sides would negotiate at 10:30 AM yesterday morning. The workers elected Shi Jiaping as the general representative. Father Yao was absent due to other matters. Director Lu of the orphanage attended on behalf of the orphanage and sternly rejected the workers' demands, only agreeing to increase the rice subsidy by 5 yuan per month per person. As a result, mediation failed. After hearing the news, all the workers went on strike at 1:00 PM yesterday and issued a declaration, asking for urgent assistance, and set up a temporary meeting place at No. 68 Shenjiazhai, Pudong Road, Xujiahui.

### A Traveler Returning to Shanghai from Hanyuan Talks About the High Morale of the Chinese Army; The Japanese Army in Hubei Province Has No Fighting Spirit; Any Slight Move is Repelled by the Chinese Army

The "Continental News" reports that a traveler who recently returned to Shanghai after traveling 300 miles along the Hanyuan River said that the Japanese army in Hubei Province has no fighting spirit, while the 600,000 Chinese troops are full of fighting spirit and exceptionally well-equipped, possessing countless machine guns and rifles. Two months ago, when the Japanese army made a move, the Chinese elite troops immediately responded. After a short engagement, the Japanese army was in trouble and was repelled.

Chinese Army Digs Trenches

Connect With Each Other

When he traveled to northern Hubei, the front line was in fierce fighting. All the few major roads in the war zone had been cut off by the Chinese army, so there were no major roads. This is one of the main reasons why the Japanese army is in trouble. The Japanese army was forced to wait for the weather to dry out in order to attempt an attack, but it was made even more difficult because there were endless large trenches everywhere. These trenches are all 15 feet deep and are obstacles to prevent tanks and armored vehicles. The Chinese dug a system of trenches, that is, each area dug trenches around its own area, and after they were dug, they were connected with the trenches in other areas, surrounding the entire area.

The People are Determined

Never to Yield

The Chinese have also demolished the city walls of various cities to prevent the Japanese army from using the city walls for cover when they invade. Therefore, the Japanese cannot hold any city or town that they occupy. The attitude of the people is that they are determined not to yield, which is gratifying. The troops are disciplined and there is absolutely no extortion or forced acquisition. Purchases are paid for. In addition to the private smuggling of goods, there is also a large amount of trade between the occupied and non-occupied areas.

Japanese Soldiers and Employees

Collude With Each Other

The Japanese soldiers and employees in Bengbu, Anhui Province, constantly extorted money, and got a lot of money. When the Japanese authorities found out, they withdrew all the Japanese troops from the area, and all the employees were shot. There are no Chinese troops in any city area now, because the Chinese troops are stationed in the countryside to prevent air raids, so the Japanese devastation is ineffective. The number of deaths from air raids has been reduced to one-fifth of what it was before. The bombs used by the Japanese are also far inferior to what they were in the past. The Chinese have also improved the alarm system, which has reduced the number of casualties to a very low level.

### Goods from Vietnam Returned to Hong Kong and Shanghai; Continued Efforts to Fight For Their Return

Regarding the goods of Chinese merchants stranded in Vietnam and shipped by the Shanghai-Sichuan-Guizhou Joint Transportation Company, the Vietnamese governor has agreed not to auction them off after the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the Consul General in Saigon to negotiate with the Vietnamese governor, and after the efforts of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and others. The issue of returning them to Hong Kong and Shanghai is being considered. A reporter from the "New Voice" learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the cargo owners have once again telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate for their release as soon as possible, and at the same time asked the Saigon Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to continue to negotiate with the Vietnamese governor to avoid losses due to long delays.

### Guangci Hospital Labor Unrest Expands; All Isolation Hospital Workers Also Strike

After the director of Guangci Hospital, Father Midy, refused the workers' request for improved treatment, more than 150 male workers went on strike. More than 400 patients in the hospital were left unattended, forming a serious situation. The labor unrest has been deadlocked for six days. All the dozens of staff members remaining in the hospital tried to arrange for all the female hospital workers in the isolation hospital of the Public Works Department established by the Public Concession and three in the internal medicine department of the female ward and one in the children's department to be discharged from the hospital yesterday and join in the united action. The workers have borrowed No. 68 Shenjiazhai, Pudong Road, Xujiahui, as a temporary meeting place for the purpose of maintaining the current food and lodging problems. In addition to organizing the Guangci Hospital slowdown committee and appealing to all walks of life, Zhang Zhikang, Qin Fuxiang, Fei Guisheng, Wang Afu, Xu Changxie, Yuan Jinqi, and others have been appointed as fundraisers to prepare to ask sympathetic people in the society to provide material assistance in order to avoid freezing and to uphold justice. It was heard that as of 6:00 PM yesterday, 69 yuan had been received from private individuals, and 41.5 yuan had been donated by the staff of a certain hospital.

### French Police Promote Meritorious Police Officers; Xue Gengshen Promoted to Chief Inspector

The French Police Department promotes meritorious personnel every year at the end of the year as a matter of custom. Xue Gengshen, a first-class inspector of the Political Department, Secretary Zou Chengding, and Zhu Genfu, a first-class detective, have been diligent and hardworking, and have been deeply valued by their superiors. Therefore, the authorities announced the promotion of Xue Gengshen to Chief Inspector and Zou Chengding to Second-Class Inspector. In addition, Li Xianyang, the Chief Inspector of the Criminal Division, was promoted to Chief Inspector, and translators Wang Wenhua, Yang Jinwen, and Zai Jun, were promoted to patrol inspector. Detectives Yang Zhenwu and Gao Qidao were promoted to deputy detectives.

### French Ambassador Cosme Temporarily Postpones Return to Shanghai; French Consulate in Chengdu Closes

It has been rumored recently that French Ambassador to China Cosme will soon return to Shanghai to discuss matters with the French authorities in Shanghai. However, according to the "New Voice" reporter's investigation at the French Embassy, Cosme is currently stationed in Hong Kong and has temporarily postponed his trip to Shanghai. Cosme traveled from Shanghai to Chongqing via Vietnam in October last year, representing the Petain government, to request the Chinese government's understanding of a certain issue in Vietnam. The Chinese authorities refused to accept it because Cosme's proposal was biased. He then hovered in the Chinese mainland, maintaining regular diplomatic contact with the Chinese government on behalf of Petain. He flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong on the 28th of last month. It is also reported that the French Consulate in Chengdu has been closed at the end of last year due to the Vichy government's efforts to cut spending. The French ambassador participated in the procedures for its dismantling. The British and American ambassadors are still stationed in Chongqing.

### Catholic Priest Simon Murdered

The "Continental News" reports that according to information received by the local Christian community in Shanghai, Father Simon, an American Catholic priest familiar in the Shanghai area, was shot and killed by bandits in Shuyang, a small area near the Longhai Railway in Jiangsu Province. This information was sent out by someone from the Donghai Church, where Father Simon's service headquarters is located. The local church community is saddened to receive this information, but the details have not yet arrived in Shanghai, so the exact date of this tragedy is unknown. It is only known that there are many bandits in the area where Father Simon was killed. Father Simon was from San Jose, California, USA, and was in his forties. He was ordained at the Xujiahui Catholic Church in 1933 and had been working in the Yangqu area for five years. He was the only priest in that area and came to Shanghai for vacation every year.

### How China Can Wage a Long-Term War (II)

— Hu Shih

Third, the historical significance of national unity needs some explanation. It is not accurate to say that China's unity was created by the Japanese invasion and three years of war, because you also know that such a miracle could never happen in such a short period of three years. The unity of the Chinese nation is the product of twenty-one centuries. China was united into an empire about two hundred years before the birth of Jesus. Since then, although there have been short periods of division and foreign invasions and rule, in general, China has lived for almost 2,100 years under one empire, one government, one law, one literature, one education system, and one historical culture. This continuous national life under a unified empire cannot be found in the development history of any other race or continent. When you imagine that the Roman Empire could continue to exist to this day, you will fully understand the national life of China. One foreign observer, seeing only a few years of civil strife in the early Republic of China, wrote articles about China's disunity. In fact, he did not understand the basic consciousness of national unity, because although China has political disputes and foreign invasions, the consciousness of national unity has always existed.

In addition to these three things, there are other reasons that can explain why China can fight for so long. One reason is that the economic life of the Chinese rear is basically agricultural, with very little industry. In this scattered and decentralized countryside, the ravages of the army and the bombing of aircraft often have little effect.

Another reason is the ability of our Chinese people to work hard and endure hardships. The Chinese people love life and know how to enjoy it, but they can also work very hard when necessary. The Chinese government has transported more than 250,000 tons of machinery to the interior in the past three years, so new factories can be opened in the interior to manufacture munitions and other necessities. These huge quantities of machinery are sometimes transported by rickshaws, sometimes by small boats, and sometimes even carried on their backs. When the Chinese people built the inland highways, they did not have modern engineering equipment, but they were able to build roads like the Burma Road and the road to the Soviet Union. The reason why our government can continue to maintain the war against aggression is because of the hard-working spirit of our people.

Another reason is that the economic construction in the Chinese interior has shown good results. We now produce more food, more coal, more tungsten, more antimony, more tin, more gold, and more tung oil than before. We also try to transport our products abroad in exchange for foreign exchange. All this, of course, boosted our morale and our combat power.

Finally, another reason why we can continue to fight is because we can get assistance from friendly countries overseas. For three years, China has been directly receiving various kinds of assistance from Britain, France, Soviet Russia, and the United States. This assistance comes in different ways, some in the form of credit loans, some in the form of military supplies, and some in maintaining the openness of our air routes and trade routes, so that we can communicate with the outside world and transport various goods. When France collapsed, when Britain was forced, and when the eastern and western borders of the Soviet Union were threatened, our trade routes and foreign relief were in danger of being blockaded. But the reopening of the Burma Road and the determination of the American people to help China have enabled our country to continue fighting for freedom and independence, and made us hope to continue to receive assistance from friendly countries. I would like to add here that without the assistance of our friendly countries, China might not be able to fight so well and for so long.

I would also like to talk about the reasons why China can continue to fight.

I have said before that this is an extremely difficult war. It is a terrible struggle to fight with human flesh and blood and human courage against superior machinery and subordinate equipment. Precisely because this is an extremely difficult and unequal struggle, well-meaning friends often ask us: Why does the war not end? Why continue to fight? Why do Britain and the United States not come out to help end the war in the Far East and focus the attention and efforts of the Anglo-Saxons on the situation in Europe?

### Wang Weiwan, Owner of Derong Tobacco Company, Kidnapped; Husband and Wife Kidnapped After Gambling; His Wife Released by Bandits on the Way

At about 5:00 AM on the 29th of last month, in front of a certain club on Jing'an Temple Road, a middle-aged couple had just left the gambling house in a white-plated car number 18177. Five bandits suddenly jumped out of the darkness on the side of the road, holding pistols, and shouted for the car to stop. They dragged the driver out of the car, and the bandits jumped into the car,

Driving off on their own

speeding west. Afterwards, the driver reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and ordered detectives to chase after them, but they were unsuccessful. Later, the original car was found abandoned at the end of Daxi Road, and a coat was left in the car. The driver identified it as belonging to the kidnapped person. The reporter from Huaguang News Agency has now obtained accurate information that the couple who were kidnapped at that time were Wang Weiwan, the owner of Derong Tobacco Company at the corner of Henan Road and Laobazi Road, and his wife. However, Derong Tobacco Company

Strictly Guards the Secret

and after several inquiries, they firmly refused to disclose any information. The reporter learned from a certain source that Wang Weiwan was indeed kidnapped by bandits, and his wife was released halfway. When the bandits changed cars for Wang and his wife, Wang questioned the bandits about the reason and requested preferential treatment. The bandits searched Wang and his wife and found 3,000 yuan in cash in Wang's wife's pocket. They confiscated the money and

Agreed to Release His Wife

to go home in order to negotiate the ransom. Wang's wife asked the bandits to release Wang and let her be the hostage. After discussing, the bandits finally pushed Wang's wife out of the bandit car and drove away. Wang's wife calmed down a little and hired a rickshaw to return home, not caring about the coat left in the original car. After returning home, she followed her husband's and the bandits' instructions and dared not disclose what had happened, in order to prevent her husband from being harmed.

### Steamed Buns to be Distributed in Mabul Road Square Tomorrow

The Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charity Organizations in Shanghai and the Chinese Jisheng Society, in view of the recent soaring rice prices and the fact that the poor cannot afford to eat their fill despite working hard all day long, have decided to start distributing steamed buns at the Guangchang of the Tongyi Yarn Factory next to the Central Funeral Home on Mabul Road starting on the 6th. The time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. In addition to the fact that the association has assigned officials Lu De and Wang Limin to supervise the distribution at the scene, the Putuo Road Police Station has also agreed to send police to maintain order during the distribution. However, this year's flour prices are expensive, and various expenses have also increased accordingly. All of the Charity Association's winter relief funds depend on external assistance. Therefore, it is hoped that enthusiastic people will donate generously and jointly participate in the good deed.

### Paradise Casino Gamblers: Enjoying the "Iron Window" Experience, Detained for Three Days and Nights from Arrest to Trial, Anxious Families Flock to Court

According to Pingming News Agency, the First Special District Court heard the Paradise Association gambling case at No. 6 Difeng Road (Yuyuan Road intersection) yesterday morning. The courtroom was packed with men, women, and children, totaling around two hundred people, mostly family members of the ninety-four gamblers arrested. All harbored anxious emotions, attending the court to hear the trial's outcome.

A Glimpse of Detectives, Hired Guards Flee

The Paradise Hotel gambling den had just opened in the early morning when it was raided that evening by officers from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, arresting ninety-four gamblers. Yesterday morning, they were brought to court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin stood up and stated the case, saying that fifty police detectives went to the gambling den on January 1st at 9 PM to search and arrest. The gambling den originally had many hired guards who served as lookouts, standing outside the door. Upon seeing a large group of detectives suddenly arriving, they fled in panic. The detectives then rushed in through the main entrance.

Bad Luck, Gamblers Arrested

Thirty-four of the defendants were employees of the gambling den. When the detectives made their surprise raid, these people had been working for less than ten hours. Although the gambling den opened that morning, it only officially started gambling at 3 PM that afternoon. In addition, there were sixty male and female suspects, all gamblers who had come to the newly opened gambling den.

Waitress Cannot Escape

Among the thirty-four arrested employees of the gambling den, eleven were female waitresses who served tea and lit incense for customers. The gambling den also provided opium for free, for gamblers to indulge in. They hired experienced opium-rolling girls to prepare pipes for the guests. The first defendant, named Li Ren, was said to be the bookkeeper of the gambling den, but when questioned by the judge, he denied any connection with the gambling den.

Gamblers Fined, Employees Remanded

The second defendant was the head of the waiters and waitresses in the gambling den, but he told the court that he was assigned to the night shift and had only been at the gambling den for half an hour before being arrested. After questioning, the judge first made a judgment on the sixty gamblers who were arrested. Fifteen were fined 250 yuan each, and the rest were fined 80 yuan each. As for the thirty-four employees of the gambling den, they were remanded for further investigation and interrogation.

Gambling Paraphernalia Seized, 3,000 Yuan in Cash

When the gambling den was raided, in addition to the ninety-four gamblers who were arrested, a large number of gambling tools and money were seized. It is said that 3,000 yuan in cash was found. The raid on Paradise Association was the second gambling den raid conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department in the Concession in a week. The first was on December 26th of last year, when a huge roulette gambling den was raided on Jing'an Temple Road.

### Murder of Housewife Case, Culprit Apprehended

On December 4th of last year, Huang Shen, a woman from Zhenhai, aged 41, residing at No. 6 Dumei New Village, Route Doumer, French Concession, had hired a maid, Cui A'du, from Yangzhou. Cui, seeing an opportunity for wealth, stabbed the housewife to death with a knife. After wrapping her body, she placed it under the bed, seized all the furs, bank passbooks, etc., and fled without a trace. A month has passed, and the case has not yet been solved. It is now reported that at around 9 AM yesterday morning, the French police, based on reports from informants, learned that the main culprit, Cui A'gui, and others involved were hiding in Hongkou. Inspector Li Xianyang and Lu Rongji, together with the Hongkou police, rushed to a bungalow on Shigaota Road and apprehended Cui A'gui and four accomplices. They were taken back to the French police station for investigation.

### Rice Store Uses Insufficient Weights, Defrauding Customers, Manager Sentenced to Imprisonment

Wanxin Dong Rice Store at No. 4, Lane 280, Sima Road, owned by Gu Hanting, and its branch, Wanyu Xin Rice Store on Haig Road, have been in business for many years and have a thriving trade. On December 31st of last year, Ma Guichao, a resident of Anlefang No. 98, Jing'an Temple Road, went to Wanxin Dong Rice Store to buy five dou of white rice, with a price of 46 yuan agreed upon. However, when the rice was delivered, Ma weighed it and found it was only 76 jin, short by four jin. Ma argued that rice is currently as precious as pearls and firewood, and the livelihoods of ordinary people are difficult. White rice costs about six jiao per jin on the market. He had previously bought white rice from Wanxin Dong and found it was short in weight. Now it was short by another four jin, which he believed was a deliberate act of fraud. He complained to them, but they were unreasonable, so he reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese detective Tian Zhengsheng was dispatched to Wanxin Dong Rice Store to investigate. He found that the copper screw on the weighing scale had been removed, reducing the weight. Every five dou of white rice was short by four jin. The scale had been used for a long time, deceiving customers by no small amount. The store manager, Huang Tongbo, the associate, Zhao Wangbao, and the apprentice, Shou Rubai, were taken to the police station along with the scale. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin filed charges of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code, stating that the defendants' actions were despicable in deceiving the public and should be severely punished as a warning to others. When questioned, the defendants' statements were inconsistent. They claimed that the copper screw had been stolen and they were unaware of it. They also hired two lawyers to defend them. Judge Meng sentenced Huang Tongbo and Zhao Wangbao to five months imprisonment each, and Shou Rubai to two months imprisonment as a warning.

### Ticket Seller Neglect of Duty, Passenger Dies Tragically

The French-owned No. 18 trolley bus, numbered 166, was traveling from Xieqiao to the North Railway Station yesterday at around 2 PM. Due to overcrowding, it did not stop at the Nanyang Bridge Station at the intersection of Route Belles and Route Aukin, but stopped in front of No. 74 Route Aukin to let passengers get on and off. A hawker from Ningbo, Qian Amao (30 years old), who lived at No. 102 Route Lafayette, was the last to board. Before he had stood steadily, Zhu Wenyuan, the ticket seller in the third-class carriage, No. 4700, opened the door, rang the bell, and started the bus without waiting for Qian to settle down. This caused Qian to fall off the footboard, and his head was run over by the rear wheel of the bus, crushing his skull and splattering his brains. He died instantly. The police arrived, recorded the number, and reported to the police station. The body was taken to the morgue for examination.

### Two Restaurants Suffer Major Robberies, Shuyu Loses Over 11,000 Yuan, Taifeng Lou Loses Over 5,000 Yuan

Four robbers, armed with guns, first locked up the staff and employees in the lower dining room. Two robbers held them at gunpoint, forbidding them from making any noise. The remaining robbers broke into the accounting room and forced the accountant to hand over the safe key.

Children's Weekly

### Standards for Choosing Toys

— Yingdai

The New Year is a joyful season for children. Every parent, to the best of their ability, should buy some gifts for their children, especially toys, which can be said to have surprisingly strong sales. However, we must know that parents cannot be too casual when buying toys for their children, and must consider them. Here are some experts' theories on choosing toys:

Using Psychology as the Standard: According to psychology experts, toys play an extremely important role in children's early childhood education. If the toy you choose is too profound and exceeds their age, the result will be confusing to them. If the toy chosen is too childish, then they will not be interested. Recently, three groups of toys have been invented in the West; the first group is for young children, made of hard rubber, decorated with bright colors, and specifically teaches children to brush their teeth. For children learning to walk, dolls wearing pants are the best gift because they have no companions to play with. Children from six to eight or nine years old prefer toys like carriages and cars, preferably automatic ones.

Using Age as the Standard: If you use children's age as the standard for choosing toys, then children within two years of age are most suitable for toys with clear colors, light weight, and easy to wash. It is also necessary to have no sharp corners and not be swallowed into the mouth. Boys and girls who are about to learn to walk like furry animals. As for boys learning to walk, balls and pushing toys are also suitable. From two to four years old, they completely like pushing toys, and they will also play with building blocks. The most appropriate toys for children from four to six years old are simple toys that can help them develop intellectually or muscularly. In short, although toys are a small matter, they are also an important educational tool that no one will deny.

Using Gender as the Standard: From the age of one to six, the most suitable toys for both boys and girls are roughly the same, without distinction. However, after the age of six, boys and girls begin to have different preferences due to gender. Therefore, a toy suitable for boys is not suitable for girls, and similarly, a toy suitable for girls is not necessarily suitable for boys. Therefore, when choosing toys for children over six years old, in addition to psychology and age, we must also pay attention to gender. Girls from six to eight years old want as many dolls as possible, or doll houses. Boys, however, do not like these, but love building blocks, model airplanes, scientific toys, or game toys. At the same time, they prefer books with pictures or words. Boys over the age of eight like carpentry tools, drawing instruments, and steamships or airplanes. Girls like complex handicraft toys or drawing tools. As for those over ten years old, the choice is even more difficult, because they already have an autonomous mind, so parents can pay attention to what they love at any time, and whether what they love is beneficial to their physical and mental health.

### New Year's Words

— Lin Ren

The calendar of the 29th year of the Republic of China has been torn off page by page. After sleeping for one night, a brand new calendar was placed on the wall, which marked the beginning of the 30th year of the Republic of China. What is the difference between this New Year's Eve and an ordinary night? Isn't it the same sleep? However, this night seems to be highly valued and cherished by people, wanting to hold on to it tightly, not letting it slip away, and even more unwilling to waste the time of this night, but who can stop it? Time still slips away minute by minute, never lingering for a moment because of people's reluctance.

Ah Liang's family spent another year on the isolated island. Counting from when they fled to Shanghai, it has been three whole years. Relying on the money his father worked so hard to earn, he can still afford to study in the fourth grade in a small school, which is really fortunate. Although he is not a very clever child, he is very serious when preparing for his studies, but he is not bad when it comes to playing. He can be considered a naughty child in an alley. Although his grades at school cannot be ranked first, he is not the last one, but only a student of above average level.

On New Year's Day evening, his father said to him: "Another year has passed, and you are one year older. In the past year, prices have risen I don't know how much, and rice costs more than 100 yuan per shi. But what did you get in school in the past year? Can you recognize more characters? Can you do math well? Is your study method correct? Do you thoroughly understand your lessons? These many questions should be asked of yourself one by one at the beginning of the new year. The three-day holiday will pass in a blink of an eye, and the big exam is coming soon, how are you going to deal with it? Therefore, from today onwards, you should prepare and review your lessons well, otherwise, the exam results will definitely be poor, not only wasting a semester, but also losing a lot of valuable money, how can you justify it? You should know that being able to read more books in this extraordinary period is really not easy."

### Getting Up Early

— Musheng

The weather is gradually turning cold. Lazy children who don't know how to love themselves often want to hide in warm quilts until "the sun is high" before they are willing to get up reluctantly. Children, this is a bad habit! We must try our best to defeat it and unanimously implement the life of "getting up early."

I think your teachers may have already told you about the benefits of "getting up early." Indeed, the air is freshest in the morning, which is beneficial to our bodies; therefore, people who get up early are very healthy. In the morning, our minds are clearest, and it is easy to receive results when doing things, so people who get up early have excellent grades... These are things that only people who get up early can enjoy!

Getting up early has always been valued. You can see it by reading the following maxims: (1) Get up at dawn (Zhu Zi Family Instructions) (2) Whether it is hot or cold, children and grandchildren must get up early every day (Hu Family Instructions) (3) For diligent study, the most important thing is to get up early (Zeng Guofan) (4) The plan for the day lies in the hour of Yin (Song Fangyue) (5) Getting up early for three days is equal to one day of work (Old Saying).

Children! Did you get up early every day before? If your answer is "no," then I hope that you will start today to change this bad habit and practice "getting up early"!

### The Queen and Snow White

— Yamin

In ancient times, there was a small country in the tropics. It does not often rain in this place, and there are no days with heavy snow or ice.

The king had a very beautiful wife, and the king loved her very much. But this queen had a strange quirk, which was that she often liked to ask the king to do things that were not easy to do.

Once—one day in winter—a strange sight occurred, that is, it snowed heavily in the capital where the king and queen lived, and the small hills and streets in front of the palace were covered with thick snow, as if sprinkled with white sugar.

The queen leaned against the window in the palace, staring blankly, as if thinking about something. After a while, she suddenly began to cry. No attendant could comfort her. Later, the king came, but could not stop her from crying, and even did not know what she was crying for, so he begged her to tell the reason for her crying.

She cried and said, "This snow scene is so interesting! But the hill is not always covered with snow! If you really love me, you must find a way to keep the hill covered with snow, at least once a year."

"How to make snow?" the king said anxiously.

"I don't know!" the queen said angrily.

The king could not think of a way, and finally agreed. He thought about it and finally came up with a way. He immediately ordered followers to collect a large number of poplar trees everywhere and plant them everywhere on the mountain. The poplar trees were blooming with white flowers.

The following spring, the flowers of the poplar trees on the mountain bloomed, looking as if they were covered with snow.

At this time, the queen could see the snow scene of last winter again, and she was very happy; and she was also deeply grateful to the king for not being afraid of the trouble of doing this.

### New Year's Jokes

— Qian Qishen

In the evening, my mother said to me and my younger brother: "Tomorrow is the first day of the Lunar New Year, you are not allowed to wear a vest. If you wear it, you will be covered up by others for a year!" My younger brother listened and opened his eyes wide. I said: "Why are you opening your eyes so wide?" "I am afraid of being blind for a year!"

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, my mother gave my younger brother lucky money, but my younger brother did not dare to take it, saying: "I don't want it. If I take it, I will be pressed down and will not grow up and cannot become an adult!"

My younger brother cried when he got up in the morning. My mother said: "Why are you crying?" My younger brother said: "I could have lived to be a hundred years old, but I was eight years old last year, so I can only live to be ninety-two years old. Now that another year has passed, I can only live to be ninety-one years old!"

### Primary Third Place in the Elementary School Summer Homework Competition: My Teacher

— Cui Guang Elementary School, Zuo Tianlin

My teacher's surname is Gu, and she is our fourth-grade teacher. Looking at her attitude, she is very dignified, but her temperament is very warm. For a semester, I have been taught by her patiently and painstakingly, and I know how to study hard. All kinds of homework have gradually improved, and I fully attribute it to my teacher; especially when the summer vacation is coming soon, she is not afraid of hard work, and on the one hand, she is preparing for the achievement exhibition, and on the other hand, she is preparing for the semester exam, and she often hopes that all the students in our grade will have a uniform level and will be able to move up a grade.

I knew that we did not meet her expectations and disappointed her; that is, when we took the math exam, Teacher Gu originally expected that a few of our better students would get 100 points.

These exam questions are very easy to answer, and all the students in the grade can pass, but I knew that ideals cannot become reality, and suffered an unexpected blow, which pierced her heartstrings; our best score was only about 60 points, and the rest were not up to par; at this time, I felt very sad, recalling my half-heartedness, and got such a result; how can I be worthy of the teacher! At this moment, my teacher, seeing me silent, used a gentle voice to persuade and encourage me; my respectable teacher, I will definitely work hard next semester and will never disappoint my teacher's expectations!

### In Memory of Mr. Xiao Youmei

— Bu Guang

A Great Loss to the Chinese Music World

In the spring of 1938, Huang Zi, a famous Chinese writer, passed away due to typhoid fever. All music lovers deeply mourned his loss. However, on New Year's Eve last year, another unfortunate news arrived, that the principal of the Music Academy, Xiao Youmei, had passed away.

Mr. Xiao's body was placed in a coffin at the China Funeral Home at 2:00 PM on January 2nd. In addition to Mr. Xiao's orphans and all the teachers and students of the Music Academy, representatives from various national colleges also participated, totaling 500 people. Because Mr. Xiao was a Christian, a religious ceremony was held. In a solemn and tragic atmosphere, everyone present was immersed in extreme sorrow. When the pastor prayed, every word was sent clearly into everyone's ears, hoping that he could peacefully enter the kingdom of heaven. And when the elegiac poems were sung, they were so mournful that some people almost sobbed. Now his coffin is temporarily placed in the funeral home, and there are plans to bury him in the Hongqiao Cemetery in the future.

Speaking of Mr. Xiao's life, his works are limited to works of harmony, general music theory, and solo vocal songs, without special achievements. However, he was a great contributor to promoting music education. In the fifty-six years of his life, he devoted almost the last thirty years of his energy entirely to the development of music education. He worked hard, without fear of difficulties. In the budding new Chinese music movement, he held a torch and led countless young people forward in the wilderness. His passionate and pure heart inspired countless young people. He managed school administration using scientific methods, and his teaching adopted a global perspective and standard. His contribution to Chinese music education is rarely matched by others.

When he was in his twenties, he studied at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan. What he studied was not music, but probably science and engineering. At that time, it was the end of the Qing Dynasty, when revolutionary seeds were sown all over China. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was in exile in Japan. Out of admiration, he repeatedly visited him. After joining the Tongmenghui (United League), Mr. Sun Yat-sen saw that he was young, handsome and promising, and asked him to be his private secretary. After graduating from Imperial University, in order to further his studies, he went to Leipzig University in Germany, specializing in music, and obtained a doctorate degree. When he returned to China from Germany, it was the time when the New Culture Movement was launched. Cai Yuanpei was the president of Peking University at that time, recruiting talents from all fields. Mr. Xiao was also one of the figures he had his eye on, so he was invited to serve as a music professor. This was the time for Mr. Xiao to initially display his ambitions. We know that China, apart from ancient music, old dramas, and Kunqu opera, has always felt unfamiliar with Western music. In a very unfavorable environment, he resolutely erected the banner of promoting the new music movement, and many young people were swept away by him. More progressive schools also adopted his songs as teaching materials. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he left the old capital and went to Shanghai to teach at the National Conservatory of Music as the director of academic affairs, and Cai Yuanpei was the president. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Conservatory of Music was reorganized into a music academy, and he was promoted to principal, until his death. In these ten years or so, although he rarely published works, he devoted himself to music education. He did indeed put a lot of effort into promoting the affairs of the Music Academy. For example, in terms of professors, most of the well-known people in the music world were recruited by the school. There are also many graduates who have achieved success. What Mr. Xiao can be most gratified about is that his students are all over the country. Among Chinese music schools, none can compare to the Music Academy. Before the August 13th Incident, Mr. Xiao had planned to move the school to the city center and expand it on a large scale. However, the flames of war destroyed his wish.

Xiao Youmei was from Zhongshan, Guangdong. He left behind a wife, a son, and a daughter. His wife, named Qi Cuizhen, teaches at a girls' school. The oldest of the two children (the boy) is only five years old. He left behind a desolate scene, which is extremely pitiful. Mr. Xiao was straightforward, not good at socializing, and very honest in dealing with people. He was a salaried class. After the war, like everyone else, his salary was discounted, and because prices soared, his monthly income was always insufficient, so his lung disease could not be properly treated, and it became increasingly serious. This person who devoted his life to promoting music education, his situation after death is so tragic. In order to comfort his orphans, whether it is the education authorities or people from all walks of life, they should do their part and not stand idly by.

A Scene from "Spring Arrives in the World"

### Random Talks in a Humble Room

— Ni Qiuping

Nowadays, old male actors often raise their horse whips beside their heads when they appear on stage, with a stiff attitude. If the horse whip is taken away, it's like "reciting a confession". In fact, because no one lifted the curtain in the past, Tan Xinpei used this horse whip to develop this clever posture, which is very beautiful. Experts call it the "side style". After appearing on stage, he would step aside. But over time, people forgot the reason, and it became a fixed format, with no so-called side style anymore. Instead, it's very stiff. People even say that the Tan school should hold the horse whip like this.

The slow rhythm of the "Inn" scene from the play "Catching and Releasing Cao" is already quite fast at the tempo of "I regret my wandering heart", but the following phrase "and rein in the wild horse" slows down again. Xu Lanyuan once said to me: "In the beginning, when we were playing for Mr. Tan, we would often slow down the interlude in advance, but Mr. Tan would sing faster instead. Later, when we followed the speed of the above passage, he would slow down again. At that time, I asked Mr. Tan what the reason was, and he said that the 'huqin' (Chinese violin) should not take the lead in slowing down in the middle, but should be left to the singer to indicate, and then it would feel different." I tried it now, and it is indeed true, but there are too few people who can sing like this.

Liu Rushi also said with a stern expression, "I believe you have all read Mencius's chapter on fish and bear's paw. There is never perfection in the world. One cannot have both fish and bear's paw, and it is difficult to have both life and righteousness. If you cannot give up life for righteousness, you will naturally have to surrender and submit. But is life so important after all? The words of the sages cannot deceive me, can they? What is the point of living as a slave, bearing your face, when you can die to show your heart and leave righteousness to the world? The so-called wealth and honor obtained unjustly are like floating clouds to me, let alone the added words of disloyalty. This ill-gotten wealth will not last. What Zhao Meng valued, Zhao Meng could also despise. Although you want to be loyal to them and be their lackeys, they will still doubt you. They will only use you temporarily. When the birds are gone and the rabbit is dead, those who should be deposed will be deposed, and those who should be killed will be killed. What good will come of it? You will only end up being scolded and regret it too late. Moreover, the magistrate is the parent of the people and should set an example, persevere to the end, be responsible for defending the territory, and not retreat. As the saying goes, if successful, it is due to the spirit of the ruler; if unsuccessful, then succeed it with death. There is no room for hesitation in between. The minister receives the ruler's salary, and should be loyal to the ruler. If the enemy arrives, the only thing to do is to die for the country. Don't use unjust words to chatter in the minister's ear. Those who are disloyal and unjust are thrown to the wolves, but the wolves won't eat them. You have studied poetry and books in vain. Is your understanding not as good as that of a weak woman?" Liu Rushi's voice and expression were stern, and her manner was like ice. The magistrate and gentlemen of Changshu County were ashamed after being reprimanded by Rushi, and they could not answer. They bid farewell and left one by one. Liu Rushi also advised Mu Zhai not to easily believe unjust words. Although she was dissatisfied with what Mu Zhai had done, she still wanted to use righteous words to awaken him and prevent Mu Zhai from falling into injustice. This was her earnest and heartfelt hope for Mu Zhai, unwilling for Mu Zhai to be surrounded by petty people and lose himself to the false dynasty. Mu Zhai should not die lightly, but should wait for the future. But what about the future? It would only be in vain to betray a beautiful woman's heart. (28)

### Words on Cultivation

(2)

Humans are rational animals. Reason is common to all people, but once emotions are impulsive and the mind becomes confused, the light of reason is temporarily obscured. People only seek temporary pleasure, no longer considering everything. When things have passed and the environment has changed, and the mind returns to its normal state, one cannot help but feel that many of the previous actions were excessive. Therefore, respecting reason and controlling emotions is the biggest issue in cultivation.
