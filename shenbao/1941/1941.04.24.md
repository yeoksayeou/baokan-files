Chongqing News: Intelligence sources announced today that one week after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese pact, Japanese forces had launched an offensive in Zhejiang and Fujian with the purpose of signaling to the world and reassuring the Japanese populace that the treaty had enabled Japan to intensify its efforts to end the war with China. However, it is not believed that Japan can end the war with such landing operations, as the number of participating Japanese troops is not large and they were certainly dispatched to the area before the treaty was signed. The Japanese troops participating in this offensive are a special landing force previously deployed in Vietnam and Guangdong. Therefore, it is believed that the Japanese aim is to induce foreign parties concerned in China to believe that Japan's next major offensive will be directed against China rather than Southeast Asia. However, it is pointed out that Japanese movements are highly fluid. After establishing a small garrison, troops can be withdrawn to Southeast Asia at any time. The intelligence sources declared that the Japanese action is intended to solidify their base for southward advance. They pointed out that Japanese occupation of such port cities would prevent any third country at war with Japan later on from utilizing these ports. They also pointed out that Japanese forces have occupied numerous Chinese airfields in the area. These airfields, if not occupied, could be used to disrupt Japan's lines of communication to Southeast Asia. Japan can also utilize these ports as a stepping stone for southward advance. Chinese sources with intelligence indicate that the Japanese forces participating in this coastal offensive consist of approximately four divisions. The troops advancing south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway are regular forces, but other units stationed at Zhenhai, Ningbo, Shipu, Taizhou, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou are specially trained landing forces. This force was used in the landing operation in Vietnam last year and more recently along the coast of Guangdong. Since these coastal ports currently have no regular forces, Chinese sources with intelligence suspect that these other Japanese units intend to penetrate inland from the coast. They pointed out that these landing forces typically withdraw shortly after a new style landing. However, permanent garrisons may be established in the important seaports of Zhejiang and Fujian. After the landing forces occupied the seaports, regular troops, numbering slightly over one division, advanced southward from Hangzhou, Fuyang, Xiaoshan, and Shaoxing on the Qiantang River. It is believed that these Japanese troops are advancing towards Yiwu, an important transportation hub. The railway, which has been destroyed, is located 65 miles south of Hangzhou and 20 miles east of Jinhua, the temporary provincial capital of Zhejiang. The railway is still operational west of Jinhua. It is believed that the purpose of occupying Yiwu is to cut off transportation from the seaports north of Zhejiang and to prevent the Chinese from assembling a large force to drive the Japanese out of these ports.

Editorial

### The Focus of the European War is in the Atlantic

Reviewing the recent war situation on both sides of the Mediterranean, the Allies' situation is indeed not optimistic. The progress made by the British forces in North Africa during the past two months of winter has been completely lost in no time, and they have returned to the battle to defend Egypt. The Balkan war has been increasingly approaching Athens, and the so-called miracle of a victory in Thermopylae and Marathon is probably just a futile dream. The retreat of the British forces will be a matter of time. As the editorial of this newspaper pointed out yesterday, the Allies have never had the initiative in these two weeks of battles. Recently, there have been various disputes and justifications in the British government and public regarding the landing of German mechanized units in Libya and the deployment and withdrawal of British forces in Greece, indicating that the British military deployment in that area was indeed not entirely satisfactory. However, this does not necessarily mean that it was a flaw in the British deployment or a failure in strategy. In his speech to the Parliament on the 9th of this month, Churchill stated that "military strategy should not be complicated by considerations of face and public opinion." Judging from Churchill's view, the battles in Libya and the Balkans should be classified as a type where considerations of face and public opinion outweigh military value.

It would certainly not be true to say that the British do not attach importance to the battles on both sides of the Mediterranean, but they certainly do not consider it to be the focus of the war. According to the British authorities, the Atlantic is the real focus. In the same speech mentioned above, Churchill said: "We only need to win in the Atlantic war and ensure the continuous input of supplies from the United States, and no matter how Hitler progresses, we will eventually be able to control his fate." This passage expresses the British's main belief and direction, and it also explains the British's view of various competitions outside the Atlantic. The progress of the Nazis in the European continent and the control of the Balkans is certainly not entirely preventable by the British, and the British authorities are unwilling to pay too much for this, so as not to hinder the preparation and implementation of the main battle. When the Balkan War was just expanding, some people suspected that the Germans might take advantage of the world's attention to the southern situation to suddenly launch a large-scale attack on Britain, because Hitler's main military force has always remained on the Western Front, and only a smaller part was used for the eastward advance. This groundless worry was fortunately not realized. At the same time, this is probably the reason why the British are unwilling to overemphasize the battles on both sides of the Eastern Mediterranean.

Now that the Balkan War is nearing its end, the next issue that the world is focusing on is of course the further movements of the Germans. Taking advantage of the victory in the Balkans, the Germans will move their troops eastward, attempting to encircle the oil fields in the Near East and the Suez Canal with a pincer offensive, which seems to be the natural trend of the German eastward route. However, it should not be forgotten that the Nazi's large-scale operations in the Balkans were originally a forced passive nature. According to their own intentions, they would rather hope to plunder peacefully and only block the path for the British forces to take advantage of the situation to penetrate. The German forces on both sides of the Mediterranean cannot be immediately imitated as the two wings of a pincer offensive. Although they are slightly similar in form, in substance, the Balkans is the main battle, while Libya is only a restraining effect. However, it was fortunate that the British's defense force was weakened, so they were able to advance quickly. Therefore, whether they will take advantage of the situation at this time to concentrate on the eastward advance is indeed a question. In terms of the strength of the British forces, it is not enough to stop the German's thunderous offensive in the Balkans. In terms of defending the oil fields in the Near East and the Suez Canal, the exertion of their joint sea and land combat strength seems to be more than enough. And the two wings of the German pincer each have their own military and political difficulties and shortcomings. The natural barrier of the Mediterranean and the Dardanelles, and the delicate position of the Soviet Union and Turkey, are all factors that are beneficial to the British and unfavorable to the Germans. Moreover, the German's lightning warfare expertise can only be fully exerted in the context of being close to the rear and with all kinds of convenient conditions. The deeper they advance, the less effective they become. The German mechanized units in North Africa were initially able to capture fortresses in succession within ten days, but they were eventually blocked at the Egyptian border, which precisely illustrates that the application of lightning warfare strategies has its own limitations.

If the above speculation is correct, then the future competition between the two sides will inevitably unfold in the Atlantic. Recently, the season has gradually warmed up, and even the storms in the English Channel are quieter than in winter, which is conducive to the conduct of this offensive war. In fact, even during the Balkan war, the Germans never neglected air and sea strikes in the Atlantic. According to a Reuters report from the British fleet on the 19th, "The Germans have shown signs of using their navy more extensively in the past few weeks than at any time since the start of the war." It is expected that this will only increase in the future. In any case, "Starving Britain" and "Preventing the arrival of British war equipment supplied by the United States under the Lend-Lease Act" should be the most pressing issues for Hitler. In recent days, the Germans have repeatedly pressured the Vichy French government and Spain. The Spanish government's recent increase in budget and repeated emergency cabinet meetings have attracted attention. The Vichy naval chief, Darlan, has also been shuttling between Vichy and Paris, seemingly replacing the previous role of Laval. Although this attempt by the Germans has been repeatedly frustrated in the past, the German victory in the Balkans has undoubtedly increased the weight of coercion on France and Spain. On the other hand, the economic pressure of Britain and the United States on Spain, and Petain's expression of benevolent neutrality, remain questionable as to how much they can resist the German pressure. This step by the Germans is naturally a prelude to the Atlantic War. If the war in Greece unfortunately comes to an end in the near future, then the focus of the war will immediately shift from the eastern Mediterranean to the western end. The British have long been waiting for this prospect with great vigilance and preparation.

Hitler can only have the hope of defeating Britain after winning in the Atlantic, and Britain can only consider a counter-attack against Germany after overcoming and suppressing the German offensive in the Atlantic. If the Balkan War ends only with the war in Greece, then it can largely maintain the nature of a local war without immediately affecting other corners of the world. It is expected that the future problem of the Atlantic will be difficult to be so simple. It is not only related to the victory or defeat of Britain and Germany, but also the key to the rise and fall of justice and violence in the entire world.

### Even If Japan Blocks All Seaports, It Cannot Sever China's Economic Lifeline; Various Inland Industries Have Already Established a Solid Foundation; Daily Necessities Have Almost Reached a State of Self-Sufficiency

Chongqing: According to official sources, the Japanese troops landing on the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts are attempting to blockade all of China's seaports and sever China's economic lifeline, but this only shows their fruitless efforts. Because China's international routes, in addition to the two major highways in the southwest and northwest, which the Japanese can only see from afar, the inland industry has already established an unshakable foundation, producing a large amount of military supplies and daily necessities. The increase in production can be seen from the statistics published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the years 1937 and 1940. For example, the output of coal has increased from 3.6 million tons to 5.7 million tons, steel from 31,000 tons to 100,000 tons, brass from 400 tons to 1,000 tons, kerosene from 34,000 gallons to 440,000 gallons, alcohol from 1.8 million gallons to 4.5 million gallons, cotton yarn from 30,240 bales to 54,000 bales, flour from 1.71 million bags to 3.4 million bags, soap from 99,000 boxes to 309,000 boxes, matches from 7,000 boxes to 11,700 boxes, and paper from 600 tons to 1,800 tons. Among them, the two items of cotton yarn and paper only refer to the output of factories, and handmade products are not included. In summary, it can be seen that in the three and a half years of the war, the output of military supplies and daily necessities in the rear has increased by at least 60% and at most three times. The increase in the output of electrical appliances, machinery, and chemicals is also the same. Not only that, the National Resources Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is also actively developing heavy industry. There are currently 71 units of heavy industry that have been established or are under construction, including factories, mines, and power plants. At the same time, the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee of the Ministry has also lent out large sums of money to subsidize private factories. Therefore, the daily necessities required by Free China have almost reached a state of self-sufficiency. (23rd Havas Dispatch)

### China is Making Every Effort to Support Democratic Countries

Chongqing: The Chinese people from all walks of life here are currently discussing China's future policies due to the rapid development of the Balkan war situation. It is deeply believed here that no matter what changes occur, China will make every effort to support democratic countries. It is believed here that not only is the fate of China closely linked to the fate of democratic countries, but in principle, China must also stand on the side of democratic countries. This morning's editorial in Ta Kung Pao said, "We do not want to just talk empty words. What the Jin people want is to seek truth from facts. China's future foreign policy is obviously an important event, but we should not discuss it from the observation point of past foreign relations, because until now, the foreign relations of all countries have been based on self-interest. The harm that Britain has suffered today is mostly due to this. In view of the rapid development of the current international situation, China's future foreign policy must go a step further or be more active in nature. We must shoulder the responsibility, and we must not only seek help from others, but also assist others. Today, there are only a few independent countries left besides the countries in South America, namely the United States, the Soviet Union, Germany, Japan, Italy, and China. China's independence is closely related to the future happiness of all mankind. The task of the United States is particularly important, because its resources are much richer than those of Germany, Italy, and Japan. No matter what defeats Britain suffers, its navy and its territories spread around the world are still important factors. Moreover, the United States will always cooperate closely with Britain. Britain and the United States must take the protection of small and weak nations as their purpose, because all the nations that the Axis powers want to conquer are those that Britain and the United States are trying to maintain. This war cannot be called an imperialist war. The Soviet Union's so-called policy of peace aims not to participate in the current war, but under the current situation, no one can guarantee that the Soviet Union will not be attacked, but we should know that if the Soviet Union is attacked, it will definitely not come from Britain or the United States."

### The Yunnan-Burma Railway Can Be Completed Within Two Years; The Entire Route is 650 Miles Long; The Cost Will Exceed 100 Million Yuan

Chongqing: Since the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway began in December 1938, there has been a shortage of rails and construction materials, and the progress of the project has been quite slow. At the same time, it is also difficult to recruit road workers, and the prevalence of miasma has caused many deaths among the workers, which has repeatedly delayed the project. Now, the Chinese government has issued railway bonds worth 10 million US dollars to be sold to Overseas Chinese in the United States in order to purchase a large number of materials in the United States and expedite the completion of this road. The work of selling bonds and purchasing materials has already begun. If the supply of materials is continuous, then the road is expected to be completed within two years. The total length of the road is 650 miles, of which 120 miles are in Burma and 530 miles are in China. Several sections have already been completed. The original construction cost was set at 100 million legal tender, but it is expected that it will definitely exceed this number in the future. (12th Havas Dispatch)

### Propaganda Issued by the Chinese Communists; Content Divided into Five Points

Chongqing – The Chinese Communists have issued propaganda from Yan'an, explaining their views on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. This paper believes that the Chinese Communists are not loyal to the National Government and are acting as apologists for Moscow. There is no doubt that this can be clearly seen from this propaganda. The content of the propaganda is divided into five points: (1) The Soviet-Japanese Pact is another great victory for Soviet foreign policy. Its significance lies first in consolidating peace on the Soviet Union's eastern front and ensuring the safe development of socialist construction. This production of peace and development is in the interest of the working people and oppressed nations of the world. (2) The Soviet-Japanese Pact has greatly enhanced the Soviet Union's international status. Whether in the East or in the West, it has increased its power. Although this is unfavorable to all reactionaries, it is beneficial to all peace-loving people and oppressed nations. (3) The Soviet-Japanese Pact does not restrict the Soviet Union from assisting China in its independent and righteous war of resistance against Japan. As long as the Chinese government uses Soviet aid to oppose Japanese aggression, we are convinced that the Soviet Union will continue to aid China. Japan's intention to restrict Soviet aid to China has not been achieved. (4) The so-called Manchuria has long been used by Japan as a tool to disrupt the Soviet Union and the Mongolian border. The Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan incidents are proof of this. Now that the Soviet Union has signed a treaty of peace and neutrality with Japan, it cannot but resolve this issue in a timely manner. Based on its policy of peace and neutrality, the Soviet Union, regardless of the treaty, is not prepared to invade the four northeastern provinces, while Japan has repeatedly attempted to invade Outer Mongolia. However, Outer Mongolia has signed a treaty of mutual assistance with the Soviet Union. Now Japan has declared that it will protect Outer Mongolia from aggression, which is not only beneficial to Outer Mongolia but also beneficial to China's struggle for liberation. As for the recovery of the four northeastern provinces, it is originally our own business. We must not think that the Soviet Union is wrong just because it has declared that it will not attack Manchuria. In fact, we must drive the Japanese troops out of China. This is a sacred cause of the entire Chinese nation, and the Soviet Union will certainly support it. (5) After the Soviet-Japanese Pact, China must persevere in the war of resistance, unite and progress. Any wavering in the war of resistance is not permitted. Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must continue. It is hoped that the National Revolutionary authorities will practice introspection and properly handle the current situation (Havas Telegraph from the 21st).

### Expressing Determination to Resist to the End; Greece Moves Capital to Crete; King Urges People to Fight for Final Victory; Declares Not Bound by Unilateral Agreements

London – According to news received here, King George II of Greece has announced that Greece has abandoned Athens as its capital and the government has been established on the island of Crete (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

London – After the news of the surrender of Greek troops in Epirus and Macedonia reached the Greek capital, King George and the Greek government departed from Athens for Crete today. Before leaving, the King issued a proclamation to the people, refuting rumors of an armistice agreed upon by the Epirus Greek army, and stating that this matter would not bind the nation's determination to continue the struggle. According to current news from London, the new positions of the remaining Greek troops in other parts of Greece have not been breached, and the two armies are currently fighting hard.

The content of the King's proclamation to the people is as follows: The war has forced us and the legitimate government of Greece to leave Athens and move the capital to Crete. The determination of the entire Greek nation to continue the war of resistance has been repeatedly expressed. British troops have now come to our aid, have fought bravely, and are still fighting in Greek territory. We and the government have not heard of the armistice agreed upon when the Epirus troops surrendered, and we do not know under what circumstances this agreement was signed, but this action cannot bind the nation's people and government's determination to continue the war of resistance. The King finally appealed to the people not to feel discouraged but to trust in the justice of the principles they uphold and in the protection of Heaven. Although they must go through trials, suffering, and danger, they will ultimately achieve final victory (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Twenty Thousand Greek Troops Surrender Unconditionally

Rome – The Italian Supreme Command issued a war report stating, "The Greek troops in the Epirus and Macedonia regions dispatched a delegation to the command of the Italian Eleventh Army on the front line at 9:15 last night to surrender unconditionally.

Further news: The Greek delegation included a colonel staff officer and two other officers, who, led by a white flag, personally went to the Italian army command to meet the Italian commander. They were escorted by several Italian officers to meet the commander of the Eleventh Army and present their surrender (Havas Telegraph from the 23rd).

Berlin – Military experts here estimate that the Greek troops in Epirus and Macedonia who surrendered totaled between sixteen and eighteen divisions, no less than 250,000 men (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

Berlin – It is difficult to calculate the exact number of Greek troops who surrendered in Epirus. It is believed to be several divisions. Epirus has an area of 9,552 square kilometers and a population of 350,000. According to the latest reports, the Greek troops in the area were surrounded by German troops before they surrendered. German mechanized units crossed the Pindus Mountains and occupied Ioannina, gaining not only the upper hand but also an absolute advantage, making it difficult for the enemy troops to resist (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Nazi Army Concentrated in Greece; Famous Mountain Passes Will Become Battlefields

London – The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a message this morning stating that Germany has concentrated thirty divisions, one thousand bombers and fighter planes, and is preparing to launch a final offensive against the Allied forces in Greece (Havas Telegraph from the 23rd).

London – Military circles in Cairo stated last night that fierce fighting continued on land and in the air along the entire Greek front, but the German army did not exert any special pressure on any point of the British front. It is reported that fierce fighting is taking place south of Lamia, where British troops are holding the area leading into the Thessalian plain. Southeast of Lamia is the famous Thermopylae Pass, where the Spartans bravely resisted the Persians in 480 BC. After the Allied forces retreated to carefully selected positions, their positions have been greatly shortened. The location of the new front line has not been disclosed. The British army is fighting and retreating, maintaining close contact with the Greek army. Relations between the British and Greek armies are exceptionally good (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

New York – Yesterday, British and Greek Allied forces resisted the German advance at the Thermopylae Pass. The resistance by the Allied forces there and south of Mount Nassos may determine whether the Allied forces can conduct an unavoidable retreat smoothly. The front line is now less than ninety miles from Athens. Nazi bombers are continuously bombing the area, attempting to disrupt the orderly retreat of the Allied forces. According to reports from London, the front line from Thermopylae to the Gulf of Corinth is only forty miles long and can traverse the peninsula to establish a rearguard defense line. The effectiveness of the defense will depend on the weather. If Greece and its allies can hold off the German forces there, the historically famous Battle of Thermopylae will be repeated (Associated Press Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Heavy Price Paid by Germany for Invading Greece; Trains Full of Wounded Soldiers Pass Through Bulgaria

London – According to a report from the Free French News Agency in Istanbul, visitors from Bulgaria have stated that trains full of German wounded soldiers are constantly passing through Sofia and Plovdiv. Bulgaria is continuing to requisition various materials for use by the German army (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

Berlin – The German Supreme Headquarters stated that German troops have occupied Volos, the most important port on the eastern coast of Greece. For weeks, British supplies have been mostly routed through this port, and German planes have been bombing it continuously. The fall of this port was inevitable after the fall of Larissa. The spearhead of the German army is pushing due west, crossing the Pindus Mountains and occupying the Metzovo Pass, and has recently reached Ioannina, the most important city in the Epirus province, which is a road hub. It is rumored that the entire Greek army in Epirus has surrendered due to this blow, but there is no official confirmation. The German side also stated that because the German army advanced so quickly, the retreat of the Allied forces was extremely chaotic and on the verge of collapse. All passable roads were filled with troops and vehicles, and German planes were constantly bombing overhead. The British army fought hard in the rear while boarding ships, which the German side called the "Dunkirk of the Balkans." As for the German Supreme Headquarters' claim that six transport ships full of British soldiers were sunk by planes, if this is true, it is doubtful how many British soldiers could be rescued. The German side firmly denied claims of heavy losses, saying that this battle has resulted in fewer casualties than any previous battle. Yesterday afternoon, German newspapers published detailed reports of German mechanized troops advancing through the Olympus Pass (Associated Press Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Germany Claims to Have Occupied All of Thessaly; Retreating British Troops Repeatedly Attacked from the Air

Berlin – It was revealed here last night that since German troops occupied Lamia on the 21st, they have continued to advance and are now only 210 kilometers from Athens. German troops are about to launch an offensive against the British-Greek Allied defense line after Lamia, on the opposite bank of the Spercheios River, where roads and railways lead to the Thermopylae Mountains. It is believed that the final British-Greek position is located there. All of Thessaly has now been occupied by German troops. The province has an area of 13,485 square kilometers and a population of 500,000. Before occupying Thessaly, German troops had already occupied Thrace and Macedonia. The former has an area of 8,585 square kilometers and a population of 300,000, while the latter has an area of 34,600 square kilometers and a population of 500,000. At the same time, Italian troops entered the Epirus province, forcing the Greek troops to retreat south. In total, half of the Greek territory and one-third of the population have already been conquered (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

Berlin – German long-range reconnaissance planes reported yesterday that the docks and streets of various ports on the eastern coast of Greece are filled with large numbers of British troops preparing to board ships. There are many medium and small ships, all with their fires lit, ready to depart. German bombers are intensifying their attacks on various ports (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

Berlin – Four British transport ships totaling 23,000 tons were sunk by German planes off the coast of Crete on Monday night. This shows that these transport ships had already left the port of Piraeus on the 19th (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

### British Prime Minister Reports on Military and Diplomatic Affairs in the House of Commons; Unwilling to Comment Much on the War Situation; Expresses Willingness to Maintain Relations with Spain

London – The British House of Commons reopened yesterday after Easter. Prime Minister Churchill was asked to report on the war situation, but Churchill was unwilling to comment much at this time, saying that things are in progress and we must consider others besides ourselves. It would be inappropriate to hold a discussion at this time. It is hoped that the House of Commons will show more tolerance to those responsible for commanding the war and show the world its inherent calmness in difficult times. The war news he can now report is the British naval attack on the Italian colony of Tripoli in Africa on Sunday. The operation lasted for forty-two minutes, and the port and ships in the port were severely damaged. On the way back, British naval aircraft intercepted five German troop transport planes and shot down four of them. The fate of our aircraft is still unknown. The British warships suffered no losses. Former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha rose to say that the House of Commons was extremely unwilling to interfere with the conduct of the war, but felt that an early debate was necessary. Australia has expressed anxiety due to a lack of accurate information. It seems appropriate to ask Foreign Secretary Eden to publish his report on his visit to the Middle East. Is it true that German troops have occupied Samothrace? Churchill replied that this may be the case, but he has not received direct confirmation. Regarding holding a debate, he will report to the House of Commons in detail when the situation becomes important. However, what he must now tell you is that we find it extremely difficult to obtain detailed reports on the arduous actions of the British troops in Greece. The deployment of British troops is extremely subtle and its nature is extremely complex. The government has not received daily intelligence from the commander. He has instructed the British commander to provide more detailed reports within the possible scope that does not hinder local military affairs. Churchill did not approve of the suggestion to ask Eden to speak at this time, as the information that could be presented was not yet complete. He also said that it would be detrimental to the House of Commons and the public to announce Eden's visit to the Middle East at this time. Conservative MP Southby asked the government to report on the military situation in Libya. Churchill replied that we know the military situation in Libya quite well, which is different from Greece. When the Prime Minister made this statement, someone interjected that Greece was more important. Churchill said that he did not think it appropriate to make comparative comments on the various dangerous duties undertaken by the British army, but he was not yet prepared to publish a report on the military situation in Libya. Labour MP Shinwell suggested a closed-door report to dispel existing anxieties. Churchill replied that the public is still calmly coping with everything and there is no sign of anxiety (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Loan to Spain Raises Questions

At a meeting of the House of Commons yesterday afternoon in London, Labour MP Wedgewood criticized the recent British government loan to Spain. He said that the funds could go directly into Germany's pockets and asked if there was an opportunity to reverse this. Was the suggestion of Ambassador Hoare to Spain too expensive? Prime Minister Churchill replied that last year, many people thought that Spain would join the war against Britain. Later, thanks to the efforts of the British ambassador, British-Spanish relations were improved and have not deteriorated in this critical moment. Labour MP Bevan then said that the entire country was deeply disturbed by the delivery of the loan to Spain. Today, no Spanish newspaper has expressed a word of gratitude, nor have we heard any other words of thanks. The Prime Minister said that this policy had been given extremely careful consideration. We certainly do not want any action that could provide an excuse for the rupture of British-Spanish relations. We did indeed consider the starvation of the Spanish people and thought that Britain and the United States should cooperate to help them. Our action was in no way intended to ensure Spain's future gratitude to us. Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton replied to another question, saying that as far as he knew, there were no large shipments of iron ore being exported at this time. If the questioner had any information on this issue, he would be most welcome to share it (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Vienna Conference Ends; Italian Foreign Minister Returns to Rome; Germany Agrees to Release Bulgarian Prisoners

Vienna – After repeatedly consulting with Führer Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the issue of the distribution of Yugoslav territory, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano left here yesterday afternoon to return to Rome (International News Agency Telegraph from the 23rd).

Sofia – After Bulgarian troops entered Thrace and Macedonia, it is expected that they will complete the occupation tomorrow. The administration of the two regions is currently being temporarily managed by the military authorities. All roads and bridges that were destroyed during the war have been repaired. In addition, the German Supreme Headquarters has decided to transfer Yugoslav prisoners of war who were originally Bulgarian to Bulgaria for release and return to their hometowns (Havas Telegraph from the 22nd).

### Over One Hundred Yugoslav Planes Land in Soviet Territory

New York – The New York Post, citing Vichy dispatches, claims that 187 Yugoslav planes have landed in Soviet territory and are now flying to Greece (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

### General Blamey Appointed Deputy Commander of British Forces in the Middle East; Iraq Declares Sovereignty Not to Be Violated; Allowing British Troops to Pass Through Is Stipulated by Treaty

London – Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey, who commands the Australian troops in the Middle East, has been appointed Deputy Commander of all forces in the Middle East, serving as deputy to the Commander-in-Chief of the British Imperial forces in the Middle East. Blamey is 57 years old and commanded the Second Battalion of the Australian Expeditionary Force in France during the last Great War, earning great merit. Australian Prime Minister Menzies, who is currently here, announced the matter, saying that Blamey's handling of the troops fighting in Greece has been highly praised by General Wavell (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

Vichy – The French official news agency in Beirut reported that the Iraqi government issued a communique stating that allowing British troops to pass through Iraq is in accordance with the provisions of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The Iraqi government is now paying attention to its national rights and sovereignty and will not allow any infringement (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Soviet Union Seals Border with Germany; Vigilance Unremitting; Evacuates Border Residents

Ankara – According to reliable sources received here, the Soviet authorities have begun to evacuate residents from an area 30 miles along the Soviet-German border. Large quantities of barbed wire and lumber have been transported to the area (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Iran Vigorously Denies False Reports in Japanese Newspapers

Vichy – Japanese newspapers have reported that relations between Iran and the Soviet Union are now very tense, and that Iran has deployed a large number of troops to the border between Iran and the Soviet Union for defense. The air route from the Iranian capital to Baku in the Soviet Union has been interrupted since April 15, and all Iranian roads leading directly to the Soviet border have been closed. This claim has been denied by the Iranian embassy in France, which said that the claim is completely unfounded. We have no military activity on the Soviet border, and the Soviet Union has no troops stationed in the border area (Havas Telegraph from the 22nd).

### Yemen Army Holds Exercises

Beirut – According to newspaper reports, the Yemeni army held exercises in the northern suburbs of the capital. An Iraqi military delegation also attended the exercises. Crown Prince Hassan of Yemen personally observed the exercises. The organization of the Yemeni army is the same as that of Iraq (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

### German Troops Greatly Increased in Northern Norway

Stockholm – News was received here yesterday from reliable sources in northern Norway that a large number of German motorized reinforcements have been entering northern Norway from Narvik in the past three weeks. The soldiers are traveling in trucks and motorcycles, reaching as far as Finnmark, which borders Finland. In addition, countless small islands in northern Norway have recently been fortified. The former Austrian Alpine troops are now in the Narvik area (Associated Press Telegraph from the 23rd).

### American Military Observer Dies in the Middle East

Washington – U.S. Army and Air Force observer Colonel Paul Rowley died on Sunday in Wobeid, 250 miles southwest of Khartoum, while accompanying the British Royal Air Force in Egypt. Rowley is the first American observer to die in a war zone. According to the U.S. Army Department, the cause of his death was a plane crash (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).

### German Troops Occupy Greek Islands; Turkey Pays Attention; Izmir Evacuates Residents

Ankara – Turkish radio reported last night that several Greek islands not far from Turkish territorial waters have been occupied by German troops. This unexpected news has attracted general attention (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Turkish Capital; Authorities have allocated a train to run daily between Istanbul and Ankara to facilitate the evacuation of residents from Istanbul (Havas Telegraph from the 22nd).

### German-Turkish Trade Agreement Signed

Ankara – It is announced here that a German-Turkish trade agreement has been signed. The agreement is based on the German-Turkish Agreement of June 1940, stipulating that Germany will purchase wool from Turkey (Haitong News Agency Telegraph from the 23rd).

### French Wartime Cabinet Members in Detention; Gamelin Devoutly Religious; Daladier Spiritless

Paris – According to the "Matin" newspaper's recent report on the Poitiers Fortress near Lyon, General Gamelin, Daladier, Blum, and Reynaud are all detained there, awaiting trial by the High Court. The guards are very strict, but the treatment is very good. Gamelin has recently been using religion for recreation in prison. Daladier is spiritless, Reynaud is still scolding Laino, and Blum is amusing himself by reading (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

### Franco-Thai Treaty May Be Signed in Late April

Hanoi – Reliable sources here yesterday said that the Franco-Thai treaty mediated by Japan is expected to be signed in late April (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

Tokyo – A Japanese spokesman said that the postponement of the signing of the Thai-Vietnam treaty was due to technical issues of minor importance (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).

### The Axis Powers Launch a New Diplomatic Offensive on Two Fronts: From Moscow in the East to Madrid in the West, Seeking to Eliminate British Influence in the Mediterranean

A diplomatic correspondent for Reuters in London states that Germany has clearly launched another diplomatic offensive in the past few days, indicating that after succeeding in the Balkans and Libya, it now intends to quickly reap the benefits. This is merely part of Germany's specialized psychological warfare. Germany's diplomatic activities extend from Moscow in the east to Madrid in the west, employing largely similar tactics. However, Germany's plan seems to involve taking more concrete steps in the west, with Vichy and Madrid bearing the brunt of German propaganda. In the east, the German ambassadors stationed in Moscow and Ankara have been recalled to Berlin. Germany may not exert significant pressure in the east until these ambassadors return to their posts. However, according to Vichy officials, there is now reason to believe that Hitler believes the time to implement his plan has arrived. Reports from various sources regarding the concessions offered by Germany to France are generally consistent, such as reducing France's payments to only cover the upkeep of occupying German troops, releasing one-quarter of all French prisoners of war, and correcting the border between occupied and unoccupied France. The demands Germany is making in exchange for these concessions are not yet clear, with only rumors suggesting it seeks permission to send troops through Spain. However, what Germany is most concerned with is clearly the French fleet and French naval bases in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the activities of Ribbentrop's representative in Paris, Abetz, and the Vichy Foreign Minister Darlan, who is reportedly on his way back to Paris, must be related to the issue of the French fleet and its Mediterranean bases. Madrid is now being forced to join the Axis and allow German troops to transit in order to attack Gibraltar. Germany is clearly making a massive effort to cut off this route into the Mediterranean and establish air and submarine bases on the route of British ships traveling to Cape Town and South Africa. (Reuters, 23rd)

Vichy: Diplomatic observers here recently commented that Germany is attempting to sever the two choke points of the Suez Canal and British Gibraltar in order to strike at British power in the Mediterranean. German-Italian forces have already invaded Egypt from Italian Libya, with their ultimate goal being to seize the Suez Canal. As for Gibraltar, they seek to threaten it from the mainland, and Spain and Portugal hold important positions in this endeavor. As for the rumor that German Ambassador to France Abetz returned to Paris from Germany carrying a plan for German troops to pass through the French free zone to enter Spain, this is entirely untrue. This rumor had been circulating even before Ambassador Abetz returned to Paris. However, as of now, Abetz has not met with Deputy Prime Minister Darlan or Brinon, the French government's representative in the occupied zone. Moreover, as the German-occupied area already borders Spain, Germany reportedly does not need to consult with the French government regarding any military actions against Spain. (Havas, 23rd)

If Spain Allows German Transit, Britain Will Consider it an Act of War

London: There is still no confirmed news here regarding the German claim that British Imperial troops have begun to withdraw from Greece. Regarding the eventual outbreak of conflict in the western Mediterranean, well-informed sources here state that if Spain allows German troops to transit through its territory, the British government will consider it an act of war. (Reuters, 23rd)

London: According to news from France yesterday, large units of German paratroopers and large numbers of barges have been concentrated in Algeciras, preparing to attack Gibraltar. It is said that Germany has suggested to Spain that if Spain cooperates, it will grant Spain most-favored-nation treatment regarding transit through Gibraltar. Germany has also proposed to France that if it allows German troops to pass through unoccupied France, it will minimize the loss of French territory. (International, 23rd)

Vichy: According to unofficial sources, General Franco of Spain continues to refuse German troops passage through Spanish territory to attack Gibraltar. After a recent decisive cabinet meeting, Franco maintained this position, stating that Spain's current severe food situation does not allow it to abandon its neutrality. (United Press, 23rd)

Germany Tempts France and Spain to Join the Axis Front, Britain and the United States Monitor Developments

Washington: According to diplomatic sources arriving here, Germany has launched a new offensive, attempting to persuade France and Spain to join the "New Order." It is understood that the U.S. ambassadors to France and Spain are currently working to resist Germany's new offensive, emphasizing that America's boundless resources are now backing Britain, and that France and Spain should not go astray. The U.S. government is quite concerned about the outcome of this diplomatic battle, particularly regarding France. If France hands over its fleet to Germany and allows the Nazis to use its bases, Britain's war situation will become even worse. People here are quite concerned about Hitler's demand for Laval's reinstatement. Informed individuals firmly believe that if Laval obtains a key position, the French navy will soon rise up and fight against Britain. Diplomatic sources here say that pro-German elements in the Vichy government are gradually gaining prominence. (International News Service, 23rd)

Germany Plans to Utilize French North Africa

London: Nothing is currently known regarding any German proposals for German troops to transit through unoccupied French territory and Spain. However, it is widely believed that Germany is eager for Vichy to recall General Weygand, as Germany hopes to use French North African ports as bases for military operations and sees Weygand as an obstacle to this hope. At the same time, Germany has permitted the French to order large quantities of war materiel and other goods, and Franco-German industrial cooperation has intensified. However, regardless of Darlan's inclinations, Pétain has refused to grant Germany any land or naval concessions to avoid compromising his position toward Britain. Pétain has shown no sign of altering this stance. (Reuters, 22nd)

### The French Cabinet Is Rumored to Undergo a Reshuffle; Darlan Travels to Paris Again to Talk with German Authorities

Vichy: Deputy Prime Minister Darlan intends to travel to Paris today to continue important talks with German authorities. However, those close to the Deputy Prime Minister refuse to disclose anything about the content of the talks. Diplomatic observers here say that German Ambassador to France Abetz recently returned to Germany to report on his duties and visited Hitler's headquarters on the Balkan front to seek instructions. Therefore, Deputy Prime Minister Darlan's decision to travel to Paris for talks with German authorities has special significance. Ambassador Abetz has just returned to Paris from Germany, and all matters relating to Franco-German relations should be submitted for discussion. Furthermore, after Darlan arrives in Paris, he will still exchange views with former Deputy Prime Minister Laval. According to unconfirmed reports, Darlan and D'Astier are currently considering how to cooperate, and the cabinet may undergo a partial reshuffle as a result. There are rumors that the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance will be replaced. However, as political figures are keeping silent on this matter, it is difficult to determine whether there is any basis for these rumors. (Havas, 23rd)

### Spain Allocates Huge Sums to Build Vigo Port, Making it One of the Main Ports on the Pacific Coast

La Coruña, Spain: The Council of State has decided to build the Port of La Coruña, making it one of the main ports on the Pacific coast of Spain. The required expenses are quite large, and it has been decided to allocate 55 million pesetas (Spanish currency) as the initial construction costs. (Havas, 22nd)

### German Troops in North Africa Are Hindered in Their Advance Due to Supply Difficulties; Fierce Fighting in Kassala

Cairo: Patrols in the Cyrenaica area are still active around Fort Capuzzo and Sollum on the Egyptian border. In the past 24 hours, the enemy has not attacked Tobruk, but patrols are frequently active. The Nazis are now explaining that the main reason for the hindered advance of German troops in North Africa is natural difficulties rather than British resistance. A Berlin newspaper published an article on supply problems, stating that supplies must first be transported to Libya, and then across the desert to the front. Trucks must be equipped with special wheels, and in addition to transporting ammunition, they must also carry fresh water and fuel for field kitchens, as well as large amounts of gasoline required for the mechanized equipment of aircraft and tanks. (Reuters, 23rd)

London: A Reuters special correspondent with the South African British forces in Abyssinia reports from the Kassala Road that the battle for Kassala continues. Italian forces, resisting fiercely, are now putting up the strongest resistance since the Battle of Keren. The nights here are bitterly cold, and the days are scorching hot. The South African British forces are fighting hard, their clothes torn by thorns, and they have encountered rainstorms, leaving their clothes and shoes soaking wet. However, their fighting spirit is strong, and they are eager to eliminate the remnants of the Italian forces in the north. The Italian forces are entrenched on mountain ridges, firing from fortified positions, while the British forces are also returning fire. As the enemy is hiding in deep trenches and high fortifications, British operations are hampered, so progress may be slightly slower. However, British officers are confident that as they gradually close in, the Italian forces will eventually collapse. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Gibraltar's Defenses Are Strengthened; Canal Is Nearing Completion

London: The defenses of Gibraltar have been greatly strengthened. A canal nine feet wide and twelve feet deep along the north side of the fortress is nearing completion. Heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns have also been increased. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Portugal Increases Defenses on the Azores Islands

Lisbon: Troops from northern Portugal have arrived here and will board ships today to sail to the Portuguese Azores Islands in the mid-Atlantic to strengthen the island's defenses. Today is the third group of troops to sail to the island, so the defensive strength of the island has more than doubled its usual level. This is because American newspapers have suggested that the United States or Britain occupy Portuguese colonies, so the Portuguese government decided to take this step. Officials here hold a very reserved attitude toward American newspaper statements, but they all believe that Portugal will face Anglo-American encroachment on its territories in the Atlantic. The statements currently issued by the Portuguese government all say that Portuguese leaders and diplomatic representatives will do their best to safeguard the country's rights in order to stabilize public sentiment. (Haitong, 23rd)

European War Essays (Four) (Six)

### A Survey of the United States Navy

Naval bases are like stepping stones in the ocean. If a navy wants to seize maritime hegemony, bases are absolutely essential. If a navy only has ships and no bases, the entire fleet's warships will be isolated and without support. There will be no place to refuel, no place to repair damage, and thus no way to make long voyages of thousands of miles in the vast ocean.

A perfect naval base must have the following three elements: 1. Location: It must be a militarily contested point that allows the fleet to control its trade routes. 2. Strength: It must have complete facilities so that the entire fleet can dock comfortably. It is best to have two entry and exit routes. In addition to natural barriers, it must have powerful firepower in the form of forts and anti-aircraft guns. 3. Resources: Natural resources such as water, food, and fuel must be fully available, and good transportation and skilled labor are also essential factors. In practice, a perfect naval base is very difficult to find. Perhaps the Hawaiian Islands base is closer to the ideal. Singapore is good, but it is almost isolated, and supplies are not very easy to obtain. In early September last year, President Roosevelt obtained the right for the United States to build naval bases in British territories from Newfoundland to the island of Guiana. Naval experts say that this move is tantamount to adding five more battleships to the United States. They also say that if the United States wants to defend South America as it defends North America, it should also build naval bases there.

In addition to its home naval bases along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, which are fully equipped to supply its fleet, the United States also has three major overseas bases: Hawaii, Panama, and the Caribbean naval base currently under construction. A fully equipped base in the Canal Zone has already been built, and the St. Thomas base can accommodate all ships except battleships. Guantanamo Bay is most suitable for naval ships to dock, so it is the main bay in the Caribbean region. In the Pacific, the United States owns the huge Pearl Harbor, and the aviation base is located between Hilo and Ewa. There is also an undefended repair dock in Manila Bay. The U.S. fleet needs a base to operate in the Far Pacific, close to Japan or the Dutch East Indies, and one option is to use the British naval port of Singapore. If Hong Kong and Port Darwin could be developed as bases, it would also be very beneficial for the U.S. Navy to repair or replenish fuel.

(Seven) The Ideal Modern Navy

Building a modern navy cannot be accomplished in the short term. Starting from thick steel plates of fifteen or sixteen inches, slowly assembling them is the only way to build the great two-ocean navy that one imagines. Based on the current military budget, the naval power each year thereafter will be as follows: By the end of 1941, there will be 14 battleships, 176 destroyers, and 115 submarines. In 1942, there will be 41 cruisers, 7 aircraft carriers, 189 destroyers, and 128 submarines. (The number of battleships will still be only 14 at this time, the same as Japan in 1942 and 1943.) In the second half of 1943, there will be 20 battleships. By 1946, the number of battleships will increase significantly to 29, with 18 aircraft carriers, 87 cruisers, and 322 destroyers. If there are no major changes in the world in these years, then the U.S. Navy will be able to dominate the seas by then. In addition to such a massive navy, there are also several hundred giant patrol bombers and Marine Corps soldiers who can assist in combat at any time and place.

Sixty years ago, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Mahan, the founder of the Naval War College, had a few insightful words: the land is rugged everywhere, but the sea is very flat. Any country that possesses a fleet that can control the sea and allow merchant ships to sail back and forth will surely have all the wealth of the world flowing to it. He also said that naval power seems silent and invisible, even more so than the army in wartime. As long as you hold a few key naval strongholds, such as Gibraltar, Panama, Singapore, etc., and control the world market, you will essentially rule the world.

The principles that Rear Admiral Mahan spoke of in 1890 have not changed to this day, but many new weapons have emerged, and tactics have also changed accordingly. For example, reconnaissance aircraft can create many unimaginable miracles, and naval aircraft carriers can bring bombers to any area that is advantageous to them, moving faster than the enemy can build airfields on land. Aircraft can also sink destroyers and even cruisers. In this European war, only battleships have not yet been threatened by aircraft.

A country with substantial naval power can avoid being devastated or irreparably damaged when attacked by an enemy. Therefore, local disasters, such as those encountered by Britain in 1667, 1745, 1783, 1797, and 1940, can always be resisted. However, according to Mahan's rule, any country's navy must have more warships than others in order to gain the most advantageous position. Bases must be built strongly and in strategic locations. In peacetime, there must be a sufficient reserve of manpower. In wartime, as soon as the opportunity arises, you must attack the enemy's fleet fiercely and destroy it. The reason why the U.S. Navy concentrates all its power into one fleet is precisely for this reason.

When the fleet is in combat, its actions must be agile and its attacks must be fierce, because all steps of shipbuilding, navigation, training, assembly, and concentration must be prepared properly before the outbreak of war. The only mission of the navy in wartime is to seize the opportunity in one fell swoop and deliver a fatal blow to the enemy. Sweep away and clear the enemy's fleet and merchant ships from the sea. Therefore, the world's two largest commercial nations, the United States of America and Great Britain, possess the strongest navies.

### Sino-American Stabilization Fund Agreement to Be Officially Signed Today; U.S. to Aid China with Aircraft, Heavy Artillery, etc.; Currie to Effectively Manage the Burma Road

Washington: Treasury officials said yesterday that the signing date of the Sino-American Stabilization Fund Agreement may be postponed to Thursday. (United Press, 23rd)

Washington: The agreement for the United States to lend China US$50 million to stabilize Chinese legal tender will be signed by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau on behalf of the United States and T.V. Soong on behalf of China. Negotiations on this matter have been underway for some time and were only completed a few days ago. It is not yet known what action will be taken under the separate US$50 million loan for China to borrow and purchase war materials. However, it is widely believed that these funds may not be used for other purposes because China should be able to obtain all the assistance that can be shipped to China under the Lend-Lease Act. The measures that the United States will take toward China are not known in detail, but there is reason to believe that the authorities here are currently focusing on the following four things: (1) Shipping both fighter and bomber aircraft to China; (2) Supplying China with larger heavy artillery than it currently uses; (3) Supplying raw materials so that Chinese arsenals can continue to manufacture small arms, shells, hand grenades, etc.; (4) Supplying trucks to increase the transport capacity of the Yunnan-Burma Road. According to reliable sources in Washington, warnings from Tokyo newspapers against the U.S. disrupting Japan's blockade of China will not have the slightest impact on U.S. policy, as Americans want to see China receive the aid that the U.S. government has decided China should have. It is learned here that Japanese air raids have not been able to stop traffic on the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is reported that the road's transportation is now managed by a U.S. expert, and other transportation experts will soon assist in management. It is also reported that the Japanese blockade of the Chinese coast is not as effective as the Japanese had hoped, as trucks can be smuggled into the interior from the coast. (Reuters, 23rd)

Hong Kong: Special Envoy Currie's observations and investigations in China may not be announced for some time, but news from Washington received here indicates that Currie suggested to the President that officials manage the Burma Road effectively and consolidate China's currency system. It seems that Chinese sources in Washington knew about this news first, and then it was passed on to well-informed sources here, and then to Chongqing. This seems to confirm the fact that after Currie left China, Chongqing appointed Dr. Baker, the head of the American Red Cross and a transportation expert, as the administrator of the Burma Road. As for stabilizing the currency system, Chongqing has also given it serious consideration. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has emphasized that, in fighting Japan, 30% is military and 70% is economic. In order to obtain U.S. aid, Free China has made every effort to meet U.S. expectations. However, Chinese observers are quite concerned that the European war may divert part of U.S. aid.

### President Roosevelt Reaffirms Resolve to Aid Britain

New York: President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the defense of the existing democratic system must be maintained in order to win, and that Britain is defending the democratic system. The current war situation cannot be determined by a single naval battle or a single retreat in Greece, nor by a single battle in the Mediterranean. He is confident that British defenses will hold, and the United States will not slacken its shipment of war materials to Britain. (Reuters, 23rd)

Washington: President Roosevelt said yesterday that he believes Britain will continue to fight to resist the Nazis and protect democracy, and warned the public not to fall from the tower of hope into the abyss of despair due to daily developments. (International News Service, 23rd)

London: The U.S. Ambassador spoke at the American Chamber of Commerce here, saying that the United States will aid Britain with actions, not just words, to ensure complete victory and defeat the totalitarian aggressors who endanger human freedom. There is a kind of connection between us American expatriates in Britain and the British people who are fighting for freedom, which will continue to exist forever even after the Nazis are destroyed. (United Press, 23rd)

New York: Bishop Walderson, Chairman of the American Committee for Struggle for Freedom, said today that the United States has actually entered the war. For the sake of victory, we should send a motorcade to Europe as soon as possible when necessary to participate in the war. I believe that there is no way to achieve victory without taking the offensive. (Havas, 22nd)

Washington: American doctors have been constantly asking the Red Cross how they can answer the call to serve. Yesterday, the Red Cross here received more than 200 applications, and there are also many doctors in Los Angeles who have volunteered. One doctor telegraphed from Chicago, "My luggage is ready, I am ready to depart, when and where can I report?". Many other telegrams also said, "Ready to volunteer, please telegraph instructions." Another doctor flew here from New York to volunteer in person. The Red Cross has now increased staff to process applications and arrange itineraries, etc. (Reuters, 23rd)

### The Philippines Strengthens Defenses

Washington: Well-informed congressional and diplomatic sources declared today that the strengthening of Philippine defenses appears to be the United States' response to the Soviet-Japanese public declaration. The executive branch proposed allocating US$50 million owed to the Philippine government for the Philippine defense plan under U.S. guidance. This proposal will likely be announced at the most appropriate time in U.S. diplomacy. Although this defense and other defense plans were all agreed upon with Philippine officials long before the outcome of the Soviet-Japanese public declaration was clear, diplomatic observers here believe that the government can take advantage of the Philippine defense situation as a military and diplomatic move in the current Far Eastern and Pacific relations. From a military point of view, the strengthening of the Philippines is clearly a response to Japan's threat of intensifying its actions due to developments in the Soviet Union. The increased defensive or offensive strength of the Philippines also proportionally increases the danger of Japan's plans to expand to the South Seas or the Dutch East Indies. On the diplomatic front, the strengthening of the Philippines may be a sufficient response to the appeasement of the Soviet Union, on the grounds that the military freedom gained by Japan cannot exceed or is even less than the losses caused by the expansion of Philippine defenses. The actual defensive steps that the United States will take are obviously limited to intelligence, but based on the information that has already been published and reasonable military strategy, the United States will focus on strengthening its submarines and air force, or perhaps also strengthening its coastal air defense artillery equipment. In practice, the shipment of equipment will depend on the general development of what the United States has obtained for Britain and China, but it will proceed as soon as possible within the limits of defense production after obtaining the necessary funds. (United Press, 23rd)

Washington: It is learned that 2,000 American troops arrived in the Philippines yesterday, the largest number of troops ever sent by the United States to the Far East. Among them were coastal defense artillery, aviation teams, and infantry. According to news from Singapore, British troops and Indian vehicles, the Royal Air Force, and U.S.-made bombers and fighters continue to arrive, and the defense of Malaya has been greatly strengthened. The British troops arriving in Singapore include artillery, infantry, and mechanized units. (23rd)

The Army has overcome various difficulties and accelerated the development of US military affairs. He expressed great satisfaction with the current organizational system of the army, and praised the morale as being very high. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Washington - The Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives is currently studying a draft law to change the age limit for military service from 18 to 28 years old to 21 to 35 years old.

As a result, BOCSD defeated Juxingcheng 48-21. Subsequently, Shanghai played against Zhongfu Dengchang. The game was one-sided. In the second half, Shanghai did not press too hard and sent backup players onto the court, allowing Zhongfu to catch its breath. In conclusion, Shanghai defeated Zhongfu 44-24. In the final match, Chuanlian played against Citibank, with Chuanlian having veterans such as Xu Zhaoxiong and Tao Zunan. Citibank resisted but was unable to withstand the attack, losing 9-30.

In the Sino-Foreign Cup table tennis match, Mike Pi played against Yisheng at 7:30 PM the night before at the Jewish Club on Moore Ming Road. Yisheng's strength seemed to be higher than Mike Pi's, but because the ball room was small, it was suitable for attack but not defense. Mike Pi's players were all from the Jewish B team, and they took advantage of the location to launch a preemptive attack. Yisheng lost after resisting calmly. As a result, Mike Pi won narrowly 13-10. In another match, Su Ge'er was unable to withstand Youbang's attack and was defeated miserably 1-11. There will be three more matches today.

### Food: Laughingly Asking Where Price Controls Have Gone; Rice Merchants Pointing Vaguely Towards the Clouds; Black Market Prices Surge Beyond Measure; Slight Reversal Yesterday; No Fear of Shortage of Supply, Only Worrying About Lack of Rectification

Yesterday, the upward trend in the rice market reversed slightly. Not only did transactions decrease in all sectors, but spot prices also fell by varying amounts of 300-400 yuan and 500-600 yuan. This was mainly because the continuous rise in prices was excessive, and unscrupulous merchants were operating with a disregard for public reason and morality, and should reflect on their own danger. Therefore, many people in the industry did not sell on the market yesterday, and the market situation was greatly eased. Although there are still some market speculators who are using the excuse that the recent orders have not been completed, and that the certain foreign firm's February rice futures have not been delivered (note that Jianyuan's sale of February Xiaojiao has been delayed until now without being cleared), and that the Japanese army is advancing south, and that coastal areas have fallen, they have ultimately failed to stimulate new hoarding. Moreover, there have been some releases of previously gained profit, so the premium for Xiaojiao per 100 bags was initially 1,200 yuan, then decreased to 1,000 yuan. Spot prices are only 151-152 yuan per original bag, while futures are 154-155 yuan, and there is still a lack of buyers. Saigon No. 1 rice was initially priced at 1,300 bags, then decreased to 1,100-1,200 yuan, and other varieties followed suit. Transactions were only 6,000-7,000 bags.

It is also reported that the Hong Kong authorities have sent people to Shanghai to negotiate with the Concession authorities and rice merchants to supply Shanghai with 200,000 to 250,000 bags per month, but with restrictions on the industry and a profit limit of within 1%. This is one of the reasons for the slight decline in rice prices yesterday.

In addition, people in the rice industry are also aware of their negative image, so they deliberately showed rectification yesterday, making a written statement with great fanfare, actually self-deceiving people with "complying with the rules of trading and no longer overstepping the limits of buying and selling." Brokers, who have been active for many days, also voluntarily suspended business for three days yesterday to avoid the storm. When asked that if they must comply with the rules of trading, where are the Municipal Council's new price limits, rice merchants vaguely pointed to the blank white clouds, talking about other things. From this, it is known that what they are expressing is not from the heart, and it can also be seen that price limits are like floating clouds in the sky, without any trace.

Domestic rice has opened slightly, but the selling price is still high at 3-4 yuan due to shipping difficulties and delayed arrivals. Wuxi Gaojing is sold at 140 yuan, Kunjing at 136 yuan, and Qingjiao Baodao at 109 yuan.

Foreign rice is arriving continuously. The Taikoo Company's Yingzhou wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 8,581 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, of which 5,051 bags were unloaded in Shanghai, and the rest will be shipped to North China tomorrow on the original ship, including 1,100 bags to Qingdao, 1,830 bags to Yantai, and 600 bags to Tianjin. There are also 940 bags of corn, which will also be shipped to Yantai on the original ship. (Zu)

### Flour Market: Tight Then Flat

The flour market yesterday was tight then flat. At the opening in the morning, under the activities of local customers, hoarders continued to engage in mischief. Huawu brand Australian flour was touted to 31.34 yuan, and Jinlong Pi Kan flour to 31 yuan to 30.08 yuan. However, in the afternoon, due to the decline in rice prices, retail investors released some, so the situation turned from rising to flat. Total market transactions were 15,000-16,000 bags, and the market base was still stable. The Hua factory's flat-selling flour was still 25 yuan, supplied by the Fuxin factory with 5,873 bags, and there was no temporary change.

The wheat market was as quiet as usual. It is found that the supply of Dumo from the interior has been lacking for a long time, and Hua factories have no way to collect raw materials. Japanese factories in the market occasionally have scattered receipts, but the number is extremely small. The selling price is still 45-46 yuan. The market is temporarily difficult to rise or fall.

### Grains: Bean Cake Oversteps Boundaries; Has Not Stopped Yet

Since the industry association stipulated some price limits for certain goods, other types of goods have been taken advantage of by speculators due to the lack of restraint. Yesterday's cake market was active for actual sales, and should have had a vigorous trend, but its rushing around was completely out of bounds. It is calculated that 10,000 pieces of Dayou cake were ordered at 21 yuan for delivery in early May. 26,000-27,000 pieces of Shengji cake were priced at 19 yuan to 19.3 yuan for delivery in late April, 19.5-20.05 yuan for delivery in early May, then back to 19.95 yuan, and 20.05 yuan to 20 yuan for delivery in late May, then back to 20.07 yuan. Two cars of Feizi cake were priced at 19.35 yuan for delivery in late April, 5,000 pieces of Luzi cake were priced at 19.35 yuan for delivery in late April, 19.7 yuan to 20 yuan for delivery in late May. More than 20,000 pieces of Changji cake were priced at 18.77 yuan for delivery in late April, 19.6 yuan for delivery in early May, and 19.95 yuan for delivery in late May. 12,000-13,000 pieces of Yuanji cake were priced at 18.77 yuan for the spot, 19 yuan for delivery in late April, and 20.05 yuan for delivery in early May. In addition, a car of Yuanlong overnight cake was priced at 18 yuan.

### Finance, Unofficial Foreign Exchange Market, Now Stabilized

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC quotations remained unchanged for all currencies. The unofficial British-American exchange market returned from loose to stable, mainly because gold prices fluctuated. Consequently, speculation among Chinese merchants and the willingness of Japanese banks to supply funds diminished. Both British banks and HSBC and Mercantile Bank had opportunities to buy. As a result, U.S. dollar contracts for this month, initially firm at $5.1875, became difficult to close and eventually settled at $5.15625. British gold remained stagnant at 3 pence 17/1875, similar to the closing price the previous evening. Trading volume in the morning was not high, with interbank transactions dominating. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

British and American Exchange Rates Unchanged

According to morning dispatches, both British and American bank rates were stable. The Indian market continued to contract. In foreign exchange markets, the U.S. dollar appreciated slightly against the British pound by a fraction of a cent, and depreciated against the Shanghai dollar by six cents, with other rates unchanged. In early domestic trading, bank selling prices were: spot British exchange at 3 pence 17/1875, and U.S. dollars at $5.15625. Speculators initially quoted May U.S. dollars at $5.1875. Russian currency firmed but was difficult to sell, and difficult to close. Zhejiang Industrial Bank sold April-May U.S. dollars at $5.1875, bought by entities from the mainland, as well as Mercantile Bank and HSBC. HSBC quotations remained unchanged for all currencies, with small counter quotations contracting by .0625. Later, news of Chase Bank offering Chinese banks this month's U.S. dollars at $5.1875 caused rates to firm slightly. Near noon, Mercantile Bank suddenly absorbed a large quantity, with some banks also bidding for this month's rate at $5.1875, which then returned to stability. At the noon close, both spot and May British exchange were at 3 pence 17/1875, and U.S. dollars at $5.15625, similar to the previous day's closing prices.

### Gold Prices Rise Slightly

Yesterday's gold market saw speculative trading, falling before rising again. The 6,700 yuan mark was briefly broken twice, but immediately retreated. Sentiment among participants was somewhat unstable. The foreign exchange market saw a stable and slightly firm U.S. dollar. Supply and demand dynamics between securities firms and gold firms shifted. After opening, foreign exchange brokers were eager to sell, briefly reaching 6,685 yuan, immediately supported by buying from silver firms. At noon, rumors circulated about the Shanghai Chinese banks withdrawing, boosting buying interest and pushing prices to 6,742 yuan. After learning that the four banks would jointly reopen at a new location, sentiment stabilized slightly. Small money shops aggressively sold, causing a pullback, but the closing price still rose by 24 yuan. Total trading volume for the morning was 15,600 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The off-exchange price was 6,730 yuan. For date switches (April to May contracts), sellers offered buyers a premium of 35 yuan. For spot transactions, Yongfengyu initially sold 50 taels to Shunyuan, at a price 150 yuan higher than the contract price. Wanfeng sold 10 taels to jewelers, at 140 yuan higher. Yongcheng sold 40 taels, and a gold firm sold 50 taels, all bought by jewelers, at 145 yuan higher, an increase of 30 yuan. Jewelry gold was also quoted higher by 5 yuan, reaching 710 yuan.

Speculative Gold Rises 24 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 6,710 yuan at 9:15 AM, 5 yuan higher than the previous evening's close. The price continued to rise to 6,715 yuan. Upon hearing that this month's U.S. dollar at $5.1875 could be closed, Yiyuan, Yida, Chengtai, and Xinfengyonglai sold, and the price immediately dropped by 30 yuan, entering the 6,700 yuan range, falling to 6,685 yuan. Tongkangyong and Defu, and Dan Jiulai bought, pushing the price up to the 700 yuan level. Chengji, Gongda, and Shihe also bought, reaching 6,722 yuan. Yida sold again around 6,710 yuan, hovering for a long time. At 11:10, the price slightly decreased to 6,690 yuan, then recovered. At 11:40, favorable rumors emerged, and Chengji and Gonghe bought again, with Yida also repurchasing. Many others followed, immediately pushing the price up to 6,742 yuan. Later, Shunyuan aggressively sold a large quantity, immediately pushing the price down to 6,720 yuan. The noon close was 6,729 yuan, 24 yuan higher than the previous day's close. Based on the May U.S. dollar noon closing price of $5.15625, the calculated price was 6,754 yuan, a difference of 25 yuan. After the close, the price retreated to 6,717 yuan, then 20 yuan lower. The intraday fluctuation was 57 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The off-exchange price rose to 6,730 yuan. The spot price of gold from gold firms was 160 yuan higher than the speculative contract price, with the buying price 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.

Jewelry Gold Quoted Higher by Five Yuan

The exchange price for jewelry gold was initially quoted at 705 yuan per tael, rising by 5 yuan at noon, to 710 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 40 yuan, it was said.

U.S. Dollar Shows Sideways Trend

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw speculative gold prices fluctuate slightly upwards. British and American gold pounds remained unchanged. British gold notes remained stable, and the market price stood still. U.S. dollar notes still followed a sideways trend, opening at 18.94 yuan in the morning, retreating to 89 cents and then rising to 9.04 yuan, closing at 18.95 yuan, slightly higher by four cents compared to the previous day. The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes and Japanese gold notes were balanced, and the market price stood still. The latter remained at 2.10 yuan. Korean notes were slightly firmer, closing at 1.84 yuan in the evening.

### Securities, Government Bonds Fluctuate

Yesterday's unofficial government bond market initially continued the upward trend from the previous day's closing rebound. However, there was excessive floating supply in the market, and some people took the opportunity to sell at high prices, causing another small pullback. The multi-party support eventually failed to hold, and the market retreated again. This was due to environmental factors. Coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the reopening of the four banks, people were anxious, making it difficult to reverse the downward trend. The fundamental reason was the impending changes in the financial sector, which were not beneficial for government bonds. Initially, Tongkang bought and Xiekang covered short positions, raising prices by 34 cents. Yitai and Hengfu sold at high prices. Later, Lianyi and Yongchang bought, while Shenchang and Yizhong continued to sell. The noon close was relatively stable. In the afternoon, rumors increased, shaking market sentiment. Although Lianhe, Yichang, and Yitai bought, selling pressure remained strong, with Shengxing, Dingkang, Delong, Xinfeng, and Shuntai all entering the market, causing the market price to fall again. Class A bonds broke through 3 yuan, and Class B bonds broke through 6 yuan. Furthermore, Class D bonds had not opened for trading in recent days, with many sellers but no buyers, so trading remained impossible. The trend and environment remained bearish. The day's result was a slight decline of 1 to 4 cents. The trading volume was 1.89 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 19.50 yuan per share.

Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce was mediocre from opening to noon close, with thin trading volume and a general lack of interest. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

### Malay Rubber Stocks Pay Dividends - Whilden Also Pays Dividends -

Shanghai Malay Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by British firm Huatong Foreign Company, is scheduled to hold its 31st shareholders' annual meeting on May 14th. The company's net profit for 1940 reached over 750,000 yuan in national currency. In addition to the previously distributed fixed dividend for the previous term for preferred shares and the interim dividend of 1 yuan per share in national currency for both preferred and ordinary shares, this dividend will continue to distribute the next term dividend for preferred shares and the final dividend for both preferred and ordinary shares, at 6 yuan per share in national currency. The annual dividend for ordinary shares totals 7 yuan per share in national currency, and for preferred shares, in addition to the fixed annual interest of 1.2%, a dividend of 7 yuan per share in national currency will also be distributed.

American firm Meilingdeng Co., Ltd. is also scheduled to hold its shareholders' annual meeting on May 6th. The net profit for 1940 was over 127,000 yuan. In addition to the interim dividend of 5% annual interest that has already been distributed, a final dividend of 1.5% annual interest will be distributed, totaling 2% annual interest.

### Yarn and Cloth, Transportation Blockages, Yarn Market Depressed

The yarn market is generally weak, with a tendency to soften. This is due to the rapid deterioration of the European situation and the intense fighting in eastern Zhejiang, which has led to blockages in transportation lines. As a result, short sellers are active. Although margin deposits are high, market sentiment has not been stimulated. The current situation is one of sideways trading at lower levels. However, some traders are unwilling to give up their positions due to the high cost of goods. Therefore, the market has entered a state of deadlock. Currently, there appears to be a greater number of sellers in the market. 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced as high as 1,502 yuan and as low as 1,482 yuan. The initial trading price in the afternoon was 1,492 yuan, rising to 1,496 yuan, and the final price was 1,495 yuan, it was said.

Double Horse yarn opened this morning, continuing the sharp decline from the previous afternoon, with market sentiment weak and lackluster. Furthermore, rumors were rampant. The opening price was 1,485 yuan, rising slightly to 94 yuan shortly after. However, short sellers from securities firms remained inactive, instead increasing their positions. At the same time, margin deposits opened flat, with little strength on the surface. The market gradually declined to 1,483 yuan. At this time, those with profits actively covered their positions, creating a strong upward force and pushing the price back up to 1,492 yuan. After a long period of fluctuation, around 11:30, long positions became active, and the crowd shouted to open, pushing the price up to 502 yuan. However, the price was still unstable at high levels, and it immediately fell back to 1,492 yuan at closing. According to the trading volume statistics for the morning, a total of 6,352 bales were traded. The amount of real purchases and sales from each trading group is listed separately as follows:

Hong Kong: 342, Mainland: 10, Fellow Traders: 6,000, Total: 6,352

### Cotton Mill Needs Turnover Stagnant, Trading Among Counterparts Is Also Quiet

The current cotton situation is as sparse as ever. Due to the pervasive war clouds in the world, coupled with the sluggish yarn market, mill owners' thoughts have turned sluggish. As for counterparts, in view of the above situation, their intentions are also not as excited as in the past, so trading has been greatly reduced. Yesterday, only one transaction of spark cotton was completed, with Tongyu buying 300 bales. The price of the machinery delivery was 196 yuan, which was still a grass bag product, and the market price seemed to have fallen by two yuan compared to the previous day.

According to another report, foreign cotton trading by foreign firms in Shanghai was not very active because all parties temporarily adopted a wait-and-see approach, but the market situation remained firm. It did not weaken due to the unstable situation and flat buying sentiment. On the contrary, those who held spot goods were still unwilling to easily sell them. Yesterday, apart from counterparts doing one or two small batches of Indian cotton with each other, everyone else stood by and watched.

The New York cotton market rose initially due to buying by counterparts, but then fell back due to selling by southern gangs and profit-taking by long positions. As a result, closing prices were 7 to 12 points lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market rose initially due to strength in the stock market, but then fell due to cotton merchants selling short. However, it rose again due to buying by counterparts. Closing prices rose by 2-3 rupees each. It is also predicted that the market will open lower by 2.5 rupees today "Each piece of yarn weighs 420 pounds, equivalent to about 4 yuan." Each Dou Xi spinning machine, British (Doberson) style, has 364 spindles, American style is 400 spindles, needs to be equipped with six to eight horsepower to reach one unit, the usual power rotation number, each chain from eight hundred to one thousand revolutions per minute, the power consumption of each machine is 200 characters weak, according to the current motor electricity price, each character needs 1 jiao 9 fen, almost ten times higher than before the war, then there is a spindle cost burden of 10,000 spindles, (100,000 characters), the monthly cost is 19,000 yuan, and the yarn mills with more than 100,000 spindles, the lightning cost burden is even more alarming, the monthly cost is more than 200,000 yuan in national currency, the monthly production of 6,500 bales of yarn is calculated, the electricity cost of each bag of yarn is more than 30 yuan, (the electricity consumption of each bag is 40 yuan for those with low production. It is not surprising either). If after the 24th of this month, more than 70% of the current distribution volume is exceeded. (outside the quota) If the fee is charged six times higher than the quota, wouldn't the electricity cost of each bag of yarn exceed 100 yuan? This is really a serious problem for major yarn mills. If, due to the saving of electricity, the workload is reduced by 50% (estimated by the author), then the workers' work is reduced by half, which means that the wages are reduced by half. Such an impact on the lives of male and female workers is also extremely serious, resulting in labor-related disputes and affecting the entire social security, which is even more shuddering. Therefore, I say: The current isolated island's industrial and commercial society is really in a situation of torture and suffering! Surrounded by enemies on all sides, it is not only the yarn mill that is in trouble. However, the power saving, from a small point of view, the losses of Chinese factories are not small, but from the standpoint of national industry, the advantages still outweigh the disadvantages.

### Piece Goods, Cloth Prices Depressed

The factory cloth market fell yesterday because Zhejiang and Fujian gangs pre-ordered various cloths and urgently sought to sell them in Shanghai, and counterparts and hoarders absorbed them at reduced prices, resulting in a slump in the sales of white goods. Fine cloth twill continued to fall by 3-7.5 cents per piece, coarse cloth fell by 2.5-5 cents, and bleached and dyed cloth and coarse twill prices were more stable. Over 400 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street, over 200 pieces of colored cloths, colored twills, and woolen fabrics were handled by Cantonese and Hong Kong firms, and over 100 pieces of blue cloth, yellow-green khaki, and bleached cloth were handled by Nanyang firms.

Eastern cloth was weak in the morning and rebounded at noon, with market sentiment slightly firm. Longtou fine cloth closed at 51.25 yuan in the morning, and rebounded by 3 cents in the after-market to 51.55 yuan. Four Gentlemen drill cloth closed at 1.5475 yuan per yard in the evening, also up 5 cents.

### Paris Cloth Has Relief

Plain Paris cloth: The market trend was soft yesterday. Yihuo Wufutu brand, dropped and sold at 21 yuan after commission. There was no original box to buy. Because there was a definite message about Lixing and Hongsheng goods. Three hundred boxes can be transported within ten days. In addition, businessmen run by Russian and Jewish merchants, said that the Paris cloth spot, there will soon be 1,000 pieces of relief to Shanghai, causing the market to shake. Those who have a considerable hoarding of goods, want to be the first to come out, but the fact is played out, even if they shout cheap five or six cents a yard, it is still difficult to open for a while.

### Japanese Factories Arrange Outlets, Dyeing and Weaving Factories Are Major Customers

The current standard for speculative cotton cloth is Longtou fine cloth, 12 pounds, produced by Japanese Yufeng Yarn Factory. Spot and warehouse receipt trading is done at the "Cloth Industry Market" (3rd floor, 25 Hankou Road), formerly known as "White Goods Market", specializing in trading Japanese factory woven fine cloth and fine twill, etc., under the jurisdiction of the Cotton Cloth Association. This year, due to the issuance of fake warehouse receipts, it has separated from the Cotton Cloth Association, and a transformed "Cloth Industry Market" has been formed by a certain gang. Futures are traded at the Cotton Industry Exchange Co., Ltd., which is composed of Japanese merchants. Its main purpose is to dye various colored cloths (i.e., Indanthrene, etc.), and the brand of the dyeing factory can be sold to the mainland and various parts of Nanyang under the name of "National Products" without hindrance. However, because it has become the standard for public speculation, the price is higher than other brands, becoming a speculative chip. Dyeing and weaving factories instead use Japanese factory Caiball, Yanghe, and Lanjit brands to make cloth, and the cost per piece is about 30 yuan. The price is pulled up to more than 50 yuan by speculative merchants' excessive and reckless bidding. However, the chips in the market are full, the inventory is abundant, and there are no real sales. Because transportation to the occupied areas is controlled by the Japanese military, and transportation to free China is strictly prohibited by the National Government, and the Japanese price is far more than the cost, the factory continues to open. If the long positions come out, there will be a sharp drop, as in the tragic drop in May last year, I don't know how many cotton cloth shops closed down. This is why, (Ji Hong)

### Sugar Market Coarse White Futures Sugar, Maximum Limit Is 108 Yuan

The previous day's sugar price had excessive fluctuations, and there was fear of other changes, so the sugar industry executive and supervisor conference decided to temporarily restrict new trading of coarse white futures sugar and stipulated that the maximum price should not exceed 108 yuan. As a result, the upward trend turned flat, but the strong and expensive attitude was still not lost. The association divided the market, and the spot 24 coarse white was initially 102 yuan to 1.5 yuan, 1 yuan, and then rebounded to 103 yuan, 4 yuan, 3.1 yuan, and 7 cents. Futures also started flat and then became expensive. The end of April list was 102 yuan, 1.5 yuan, 2.2 yuan, 2 yuan, 3.5 yuan, 5.5 yuan, 5 yuan, 4 yuan, and 4.5 yuan, 4 yuan, down by 34 yuan. The May 10th list was 103 yuan, 2.5 yuan, 2.7 yuan, 2.8 yuan, 3 yuan, 4 yuan, 4.5 yuan, 6 yuan, 6.8 yuan, 6 yuan, 5 yuan, and 5.5 yuan, slightly lower by 3.5 yuan compared to the highest price. Dutch raw sugar 80 yuan, nearly 10 yuan higher than (the 17th), Taikoo car white B brand West Warehouse 111 yuan, East Warehouse 110 yuan, (the 21st) about 5 yuan higher, DY brand East and West warehouses pulled 102 yuan, 7 yuan higher, HX brand West warehouse 102 yuan, the increase is the same. This factory's snow white also took the opportunity to move, rising to a new high price of 102 yuan. This fourth-grade white was 98 yuan, and Jingming ice also saw a new high price of 138 yuan. This ice flower Qing was priced at 85 yuan.

### Oilseed Hemp, Hemp Bags Are Firm

The market price of hemp bags has been fluctuating recently, and now it is gradually becoming firm. The market stock is still thin, and the turnaround in recent days has shifted, such as 2.5-pound new green has reached 5.5 yuan, 2.25 pounds is 5.2 yuan, fork rushed new bag 5 yuan, this street rushed new bag 4.8 yuan, rice white thread 4.6 yuan, rice wheat rushed new 4.2 yuan, dry sugar bag 3 yuan, soy blue thread bag 2.3 yuan, Indian hemp bag thread 2,900 yuan per thousand pounds, fork hemp bag cloth 2,000 yuan, domestic original machine cloth 2,200 yuan per thousand pieces, and flat silk cloth 2,150 yuan. However, Hang green hemp has recently arrived, and the price is more appropriate, each piece is 140 yuan, (Yan)

### Coal, Coal Balls Have No Hope of Rising Again

The market conditions for coal balls have been stable in recent days due to warm weather and sluggish sales. The supply of coal powder is also constant, and the ships for next month have also been booked, so there is no shortage. In addition, a coal ball factory in Nanshi has recently established an industry self-vehicle, at 275 yuan per ton, so various factories in the concession have also started competing, and the dark price has recovered slightly. The goods from large factories are 292 yuan, and the small factories are 78 yuan cheaper. There is no reason to rise again in the near future. The news that a certain newspaper recently spread about the brisk news of coal ball wholesale demolition is also a castle in the air and is not true.

### Miscellaneous, Soap Is More Expensive

Daily necessities, such as soap, have a strong upward trend. Various parties have smooth demand, and sales are few. Those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them easily, and the market is becoming more and more tight, causing prices to soar. Yesterday, the market opened, such as Gu Ben soap was sold to 51.5 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao soap was 47.5 yuan per box, Huang Xiangmao soap was 41 yuan per box, and scissors soap was 40.05 yuan per box. The buying prices were more than last week.

### Hardware, Large Tinplate, One Up and One Flat

The American large tinplate of No. 26 and No. 24, because the factory's procurement is weak and there is not much progress in other sales channels, the market appears very quiet. However, because overseas goods have disappeared, those who hold the goods still have high expectations. Among them, because the market price of No. 24 colors rose too much in the past, the actual sales are even more rare, and the standard is also stagnant. The goods of No. 26 are priced cheaply, so there are many inquiries, and the market is rising step by step. Yesterday, for example, No. 24 was sold for 1,200 yuan per box, (no up or down compared to the previous), and No. 26 was shouted for 150 yuan per box, about 50 yuan higher than the previous market.

### Towels (Continued)

— Guo Xiushi

There are many types of printed towels. One type is printed in the center of the towel - that is, the part with the raised loops - and another type is printed on the plain cloth at both ends of the towel. There are also towels woven with colored yarn in grids, stripes, etc., with printing added. There are also towels with small flowers printed around the perimeter. Most printed towels are printed on one side, while fine products are printed on both sides, which is extremely beautiful.

Three steps are required to prepare printed towels: First, the pattern must be novel; second, the position must be chosen appropriately; third, the colors must be harmoniously matched! Otherwise, it will lose the "beauty" condition. Although the flower-woven towels are woven with colored yarn in grids, stripes, and other patterns, they look very simple, but the colored yarn must be properly matched in order to be called "beautiful" and to be pleasing and pleasing. If the colored yarn is not properly matched, it is "tacky".

There are few jacquard face towels. However, there are many jacquard towel fabrics, bath towels, bed towels, etc., so there are more patterns.

Towel fabrics are mostly used for making bath towels and pajamas. Unfortunately, although this fabric has many patterns and beautiful colors, many of the dyes used are not washable and will fade in the water. Isn't this a fly in the ointment! It also loses credibility. I hope that weaving factories will reform this - end -

### Yarn Factories Are Affected By Electricity, Large-Scale Reduction In Work Is A Must

Since the power company's emergency measures, decided to implement new emergency restrictions from the 24th of this month (from the decision date of the meter reading after the 24th.). All users with electricity consumption exceeding 1,000 degrees will be charged six times the price. The first to bear the brunt of this will undoubtedly be the textile factories in light industry. It should be known that each 10,000 spindles consumes more than 100,000 degrees of electricity per month. Yarn factories with more than 50,000 spindles need 1,000 kilowatts of electricity per hour. Working 24 hours a day and night, the electricity consumption is 24,000 characters. Calculated for 28 days of work a month, (excluding 48 hours on Sunday nights), a total of more than 670,000 characters of electricity are required. Before the war, (before August 13th), the motor electricity price per character was 2 cents in national currency, and yarn factories with more than 5 acres of spindles had to pay a monthly electricity bill of 134,000 yuan, averaging 3 yuan 67 jiao per bag of yarn produced per month, (calculated at 1 pound per 10,000 spindles). If we add a detailed analysis, we said earlier that the work of one day and night consumes 24,000 characters of electricity, estimated at 50,000 spindles, each 10,000 spindles needs 4,800 characters of electricity, the electricity fee is 2 cents per character, (before the war), a total of 96 yuan of electricity fee in national currency is required, (that is, each spindle needs 9.6 cents of electricity, that is, the electricity cost per pound of yarn is borne).

### Hong Kong Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Negotiate, Monthly Supply of Food for Shanghai Residents Determined, Minimum of 200,000 Bags of "Small Grain Rice" Guaranteed, Profit Limits Enforced with Unified Procurement and Sales, Commissioners Hallett and Others to Return to Hong Kong Soon to Report on Negotiations

The authorities of the two foreign concessions have shown deep concern for the overall food supply of Shanghai. Earlier this month, they organized a committee and chartered ships to ensure that 15,000 to 20,000 tons of Rangoon rice could be transported to Shanghai monthly, increasing the food reserves and benefiting the people. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the rice-producing areas under British and French jurisdiction, requesting facilitation for the shipment of rice to Shanghai. The Hong Kong government, recognizing the close relationship between Hong Kong and Shanghai, specially appointed commissioners, including Henry Hallett, to come to Shanghai to negotiate with the authorities of the two concessions. This would ensure a monthly supply of 200,000 to 250,000 bags of special "small grain" rice from Rangoon. Mr. Hallett and his team met with Deputy Director General Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Jiang Hongbin and others previously to discuss the rice supply. To expedite the process, they are scheduled to return to Hong Kong to report on the negotiations. It was decided that unified procurement and sales would be adopted for Hong Kong rice to prevent speculators from manipulating the market. The Standing Committee has already sent a letter to the Grain, Bean, and Rice Associations, urging them to quickly organize a group for centralized procurement to increase reserves and benefit the people's food supply.

Decision to Organize a Procurement Group

After receiving the letter from the Shanghai Bean, Rice, and Grain Associations, they immediately convened a joint meeting of the third session of the executive and supervisory committees at 3 PM yesterday. The proposal was unanimously approved on the spot and will be announced to the grain and rice markets today. Because the Hong Kong government has appointed a representative to Shanghai to discuss the unified procurement and sales of Hong Kong rice with Deputy Director General Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and has instructed the two Shanghai associations to organize a procurement group, a joint meeting of the third session of the executive and supervisory committees and the "Jian Mi" (pointed rice) group was convened. It was decided that the principle of organizing a group to purchase Hong Kong rice was approved. After collecting opinions and confirming the quantities, a special committee will be established to formulate specific measures and implement the matter. It is hereby announced that all businesses should consider the aforementioned decision. Those who agree to participate should submit a written report of the quantity they wish to purchase to the two Shanghai associations by the 25th of this month. As for the specific methods, they will be discussed after the quantities have been collected. This announcement is specifically made. At yesterday's joint meeting, Chairman Jiang Hongbin also reported that he was summoned by Deputy Director General Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council a few days ago and rushed to the meeting. Mr. Ho introduced the four members sent by the Hong Kong government. After discussions, it was agreed that the Hong Kong government would supply a large amount of foreign rice each month. The foreign rice would contain 42% broken rice.

Middle Class Can Benefit

Reporters from the "New Voice" newspaper learned from rice industry sources yesterday that Hong Kong's rice reserves have now exceeded the specified limit. In the future, the excess rice can be shipped to Shanghai, with a maximum of 250,000 bags and a minimum of 200,000 bags per month. It is understood that after the foreign rice arrives in Shanghai, it must be sold to legitimate rice shops approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council for circulation in the market and must not be hidden. The profit margin for rice merchants when selling is limited to 10%. Anyone who violates this rule will not be entitled to these rights in the future. The rice supplied by the Hong Kong government is limited to special small grain rice from Rangoon. The selling price has not yet been formally agreed upon and will be equivalent to the prices of various grades of rice in Shanghai. Therefore, after the rice arrives, middle-class residents may be able to purchase cheaper rice.

Rice Market Announcement: Do Not Exceed Limits Again

The Rice Market Management Committee, due to the continuous surge in rice prices in recent days, which not only hinders the people's livelihood but also affects the safety of its own business, specially issued Notification No. 189 yesterday morning, which stated: "Announcement: The organization of this market was originally intended to regulate the people's food supply and balance market prices. Since its establishment, it has been over three years. However, it has gone through turbulent waves and changing situations, and now it has deviated from its original intention. Even with foreign rice, although transportation is difficult and freight costs have increased dramatically, futures contracts have been signed, and rice is continuously transported to Shanghai, accumulating to over a million bags. The Special District authorities, to consider the difficulties of merchants, have cancelled the price evaluation, benefiting rice merchants in every possible way. However, in less than ten days, prices have soared again. Therefore, the Special District authorities, for the sake of public order and the livelihood of the people, have to reimpose strict restrictions. This market, under orders, has already made announcements known to all. However, before the ink is dry, market prices have become chaotic again. This phenomenon is truly unacceptable. Therefore, we are issuing another announcement: All our merchants must comply with regulations and consider the overall situation, and must not exceed limits when buying and selling. Those who dare to deliberately violate this will be held accountable. Do not deceive yourselves and ruin the market's reputation. This announcement is specially made known to all. We hope that everyone will comply."

Rice Shops Demand Elimination of "Extra Fees"

Since the bulk of rice was manipulated in Shanghai and cut off, panic about the food supply has increased day by day. Although the authorities have evaluated and set standard selling prices, those groups are incorrigible, recklessly ravaging the market and continuing to raise prices for profit, resulting in rampant black market deals and soaring "extra fees." All rice shops in the city procure the spot goods they sell each day from the market, making a profit of 1.5 yuan per "shi" (unit of dry volume). However, since the black market appeared, no one seems to be selling according to the set limits. To cope with market consumption, rice shops are selling at a loss. Yesterday at 1 PM, more than 300 rice shop representatives gathered in front of the Rice Industry Association at the Mouyi Rice Shop on Shanhai Guan Road, requesting that the association find a way to ask the authorities to ban the black market. After the association leaders persuaded them, they returned around 4 PM. However, before leaving, they stated that they would stop entering the market to buy and sell starting today.

Brokers Temporarily Suspend Market Entry Starting Yesterday

Due to the rampant black market and soaring "extra fees" in the rice market, with the highest premium reaching 1,800 yuan, the Rice Broker Association, to avoid criticism from the outside world, separately notified its members in writing the day before yesterday, instructing them to temporarily suspend brokerage activities starting yesterday. All members, after learning of this, stopped entering the market yesterday. It is understood that after the rice market returns to normal, they will resume brokerage activities. Yesterday, the rice market saw a slight decrease in prices by 3-4 yuan per "shi" compared to the previous day, as the authorities were determined to take thorough measures, the Rice Market Management Committee reiterated the ban, and 30,000 bags of rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Speculators, fearing being hit, began to rein themselves in slightly. It is expected that under the Standing Committee's determination to stabilize the food supply for the people of Shanghai, prices can continue to fall.

### Four Banks Maintain Shanghai's Financial Market, Resume Interbank Clearing, Transfer of Funds Restored Yesterday, But Cash Withdrawals from the Four Banks Not Allowed

The Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, after temporarily suspending operations since April 17th, have received orders from their headquarters to resume operations as soon as possible to maintain financial stability. The branches are now preparing to resume operations, and the concession authorities have pledged to provide full protection. It is reported that during the suspension, the banks negotiated to find ways to adjust interbank finances to maintain the overall financial situation. Transfer of funds has been restored since yesterday. Fund transfer orders from banks and financial institutions to the four banks can be cleared through the Banking Clearing House. However, these fund transfer orders cannot be directly taken to the four banks to withdraw cash. With this adjustment, the financial market has become more stable. Rumors of withdrawal have been proven untrue, and speculation has subsided, calming people's minds. It is reported that the four banks have resumed interbank clearing directly to adjust interbank finances and indirectly to maintain Shanghai's industry and commerce.

Rumor: Four Banks to Establish Joint Office

The "Times" newspaper reported that last night (April 23rd), authoritative sources said that the four banks under the Chinese government, the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, plan to close their branches here to protect their employees from attacks and establish a joint office to continue operations. It is said that the equipment in the joint office can defend against terrorist activities, but its address has not been disclosed, but it will supposedly open soon. The joint office of the four banks will have only 100 staff members to provide service and prepare to gradually reduce the scope of business and encourage customers to do business with commercial banks or money houses here. According to reliable sources, before the joint office is established, the banks will first resume business. When reporters investigated Chinese semi-official banking circles and asked where the joint office will be located, it was said that the joint office will be in a new building west of Tongfu Road on Jing'an Temple Road. As for the opening date, it is said to be within this month, as the building is currently being equipped with various protective facilities.

It is assumed that those who went there arrived in black cars. Unable to enter the residences of the three judges, they fired 30 to 100 shots and then fled. The patrolmen protecting the three residences also fired dozens of shots in return. Those who went to Li's residence threw a hand grenade when they fled, damaging an electric car parked at the entrance of Li's lane.

### Japanese Troops Attempt to Advance in Ningbo, Stopped by Chinese Troops, Chinese Troops Arrive and Counterattack the Urban Area, Japanese Planes Bomb Outside Ningbo's West Gate

The war situation in eastern Zhejiang has stabilized after the strong resistance of the Chinese army. Fierce battles continue in the suburbs of the occupied areas. The Datong News Agency reporter now records the situation as follows:

Chinese Troops Arrive

According to the Datong News Agency reporter, who learned from Zhejiang groups in Shanghai: (1) Japanese troops in Ningbo reinforced their attacks on Shiqi, Cixi, and Yuyao starting on April 21st but were met with strong resistance from Chinese troops and failed to succeed. (2) Chinese troops continued to arrive and began to counterattack the urban area. (3) Japanese troops occupying Haimen attacked Huangyan, and fierce battles continued. The situation in Wenzhou was extremely chaotic. (4) The area from Xicheng to Wangchun Bridge outside Ningbo's West Gate was bombed by Japanese planes. (5) Japanese troops landing in Shipu were met with strong resistance and dared not continue to advance.

Countryside Peaceful

Mail and telecommunications between Shanghai and the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have been completely cut off due to the war. Shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang has also been interrupted. However, mail and telecommunications with the inland areas of eastern Zhejiang are still maintained. Zhejiang natives in Shanghai, deeply concerned about their hometowns, have been sending telegrams to inquire about details. Yesterday, a private telegram stated that residents of Ningbo, Zhenhai, Shaoxing, and Shipu mostly evacuated to the remote mountains in the countryside when the Japanese troops landed. Currently, the situation in the remote areas is still peaceful, so there are few casualties among the residents, which is comforting.

It is said that the nine escapees were arrested in Nanshi and the western district two weeks ago.

### Cornaby to Return to England via America Tomorrow Morning, Colleagues Will See Him Off at the Wharf

Cornaby, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, after announcing his retirement at the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 17th, immediately decided to leave Shanghai for England for a short period to meet his wife. Western newspapers reported that Cornaby would leave this Monday, but "New Voice" reporters learned from Cornaby that he would leave Shanghai tomorrow. It is now reported by sources close to Cornaby that the former Chairman has decided to take a sea voyage to relax, taking the route via San Francisco in America and returning to England across the Atlantic Ocean. Cornaby is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow morning on the American De Tong Lun Company's President Coolidge.

Cornaby is currently the General Manager of Jardine Matheson & Co., having been in China for fourteen years.

Following His Grandfather

As General Manager of Jardine Matheson & Co., Cornaby was promoted to Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Committee Member of the British Chamber of Commerce in 1936. He was re-elected in 1938 and served as Deputy Chairman for two terms. Last year, Chairman Fessenden retired, and Cornaby took over. At the foreign taxpayers' meeting held at the Race Club on January 23rd this year, Cornaby eloquently explained why the administrative structure of the Concession could not be changed and the 40% tax increase was justified. He was then wounded in the arm by Lin Xiongji’s gunshot. Later, at a special foreign meeting reopened on January 5th, the tax increase plan was passed. Cornaby went to Hong Kong for treatment before returning to Shanghai to preside over the election of the council directors. According to Cornaby's associates, Cornaby is not expected to return to Shanghai in the short term. People in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, have expressed their regret at Cornaby's departure.

### Commercial Press Did Not Resume Operations Yesterday, All Parties Mediate Together, Distribution Offices and Factories Closed, Mediators Plan to Telegraph Hong Kong for Negotiations

The labor dispute at the Commercial Press, after all employees of the press began a slowdown strike on the afternoon of the 22nd, saw the doors of the press tightly closed yesterday. Many Chinese and Western detectives were stationed around the press. Only a Mr. Jie Qiansheng remained inside, and no one else was seen. Yesterday, a person in charge of the Commercial Press Workers' Association told a "Da Guang" (Great Light) News Agency reporter that this action by the association was a last resort. We cannot bear to see China's largest cultural institution collapse, but the company's management is too unsympathetic to the livelihood of the employees and has rejected our reasonable demands. All employees are willing to make reasonable struggles under the legal leadership of the workers' association. We are currently awaiting a response from the Hong Kong authorities. If they continue to adhere to their views, the future will be unthinkable.

Labor Party Deliberations

The labor party of the press convened a general meeting of all employees in the warehouse on Guangdong Road yesterday morning and resolved: (1) to collect a special donation of two yuan per person to prepare for any subsequent expenses, and (2) to compile a directory of all employees (which was completed yesterday) for communication purposes. The reporter also learned from another source that the management of the press was still very firm yesterday. It is reported that the book industry, to avoid the expansion of the situation, will come forward to mediate and plans to work with Miss Hinden, director of the Industrial Division of the Shanghai Municipal Council, to telegraph Hong Kong to Qian Yunwu, the general manager, to negotiate mediation terms to quickly resolve the situation.

Workers' Attitude

According to representatives of the factory workers of the association, the management closed the distribution offices and all factories the night before, and all employees could not enter the factories to work, gathered in the open air, and no one was responsible, causing outrage. Each factory on Gordon Road, Jiujiang Road, and Jing'an Temple Road has a mutual aid society established, but in this critical moment, the societies are still not actively leading the employees to negotiate with the management. All employees, because of their vital interests, feel that there is no one to lead them and immediately held an automatic meeting, immediately forming a workers' representative group and cooperating with the workers of the distribution offices with the same demands and unified steps, and organizing a joint office. The temporary office is established in the Jing'an Temple Road factory. All employees are calm and in good condition. It is reported that the general manager of the World Book Company, Lu Gaoyi, has been mediating with the Industrial Division of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the labor and management parties for preliminary mediation.

### A Child Reading at a Bookstall Suddenly Reports His Disappearance
### Three or Four Children Vanish Without a Trace; Small Bookstall Owner Also Reported Missing

Shen Yuan Coal Store, located at No. 251 Juli Road in the concession, is opened by Yang Zhaohong from Ningbo. Yang Zhaohong has an elder brother named Zhaobi, who sets up a small bookstall in front of the store to make a living. Last night at 9 p.m., three or four children were at the bookstall browsing small books. The children's families, because the children had been out for a long time, went to the bookstall to check, but could not find any trace of the children. They searched extensively nearby, but found nothing. The children's families suspected that Yang Zhaobi had abducted and hidden them, and immediately reported it to the police. Detectives were dispatched to search inside the Shen Yuan Coal Store to see if any missing children were there. It is heard that Yang Zhaobi is also out and his whereabouts are unknown. The police are still investigating the details.

Judge's Residence on Connaught Road Shot at Last Morning

Yesterday morning at 4:40 a.m., a car suddenly appeared at Lane 732, Connaught Road, carrying several men, intending to drive into the lane. The lane watchman, considering it was late at night and their behavior was suspicious, refused to open the lane gate. The people in the car, seeing no progress, opened fire into the lane, firing more than twenty shots before speeding away in the original car. Afterwards, it was learned that Gui Yu, a judge of the Civil Division of the Special First Court, lived at No. 28 in the lane. It is speculated that someone intended harm to him.

Landlord of Lian Zhu Lane Raises Rent
Tenants Firmly Oppose

Landlord Disregards Good Faith and Changes His Mind Repeatedly
Tenants Unite and Fight, Refusing to Yield

A Cantonese merchant named Chen, the landlord of Lian Zhu Lane on Avenue Edward VII, and the renting agent, Maiton & Co., had negotiated with the tenants about raising the rent, and an agreement was reached, stipulating that the rent would not be increased again within two years. Only the water bill would be borne by the tenants if it increased in the future. Seeing the tenants were accommodating, but also feeling it was inconvenient, they openly broke the agreement and colluded with a foreigner from a certain country to come forward, using the excuse of buying all the buildings on the land in the lane, and uniquely notified Nos. 9, 11, and 12 in the lane to move out within a limited time. The method was already bizarre. On the 5th of this month, they deliberately published an advertisement for sale, but only specified one or two houses, not the entire lane, and the timing was after the purchase requested by the foreign merchant, clearly intending to intimidate. After receiving the news, the tenants were greatly angered, believing that it concerned the public interest and was not just the affair of one or two families. Why single out one or two families for oppression? Therefore, they unanimously entrusted Chinese and foreign lawyers to negotiate separately. The landlord gradually realized they were in the wrong and also entrusted a lawyer to mediate, willing to fulfill the previous agreement and not increase the rent within two years. The water bill, if it increased in the future, would still have to be borne by the tenants. The tenants, having already increased the rent, felt that the water bill was naturally included and should not be borne separately. After negotiations with the opposing lawyer, the tenants, in order to settle the matter, agreed to accept the water bill proposed by the landlord, calculated as an annual average, with the tenants bearing any amount exceeding one thousand yuan per month. Just as both parties were about to sign a settlement agreement, the landlord and Maiton & Co. broke the agreement again, changing the agreement of not increasing the rent for two years to one year. Seeing the landlord repeatedly going back on their word and not honoring their commitments, the tenants again asked a lawyer to deal with them legally. If the landlord and Maiton & Co. continued to use oppressive measures, they were determined to unite and fight to the end, striving to uphold justice and ensure secure housing.

Copper and Iron Factory Fire
Six People Burned

At No. 23, Lane 638, New Zha Road (i.e., Sze Sween Li), the Ren De Copper and Iron Machinery Factory caught fire yesterday at 6:30 p.m. due to the overturning of a barrel of alcohol. Dense smoke filled the air, and the fire was extremely fierce, spreading to the neighboring Ta Teh Pharmaceutical Factory in an instant. The fire was finally extinguished after the Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and made every effort to put it out. As a result, two buildings were completely burned down. During the blaze, six people from the Ta Teh Pharmaceutical Factory escaped from the fire, suffering severe burns. Their names are as follows: Chen Longyao, 18 years old; Xie Huiwang, 24 years old; Lu Qingyun, 18 years old; both suffered injuries all over their bodies and are in critical condition.

Robbers Steal Car
The Car's Whereabouts Are Unknown

Last night at 9:40 p.m., the Yong An Automobile Company at No. 9 Yangshupu Road suddenly received a phone call requesting a car to be dispatched to wait at the intersection of Zhejiang Road on Rue du Consulat. The company immediately dispatched a car (registration number 17631) to the location. A man got into the car and asked to be driven to Connaught Road. The man then forced the driver out of the car and drove off himself at high speed. The reason for the car theft could not be investigated immediately, and the car's whereabouts are unknown.

However, Pan Shishou, the son of Pan Ruixin's concubine, Ms. Han, was not given a share, only Pan Shishou's wife, Ms. Qin, was given 13,000 yuan, reportedly in accordance with his father's will. Recently, Pan Shishou discovered that the will had been forged by Pan Shiqi in collusion with lawyers A and B, intending to seize the inheritance he was entitled to.

Free Talk Social Blood Donation Society Guo Hongdi

What is the most precious thing on a human being? The answer may vary from person to person, but the sentence "Blood is the most precious thing on a human being" is probably something no one would object to.

People have always regarded blood as a symbol of sacrifice, so the blood of martyrs is often remembered and never forgotten, and the precious blood of Jesus Christ has finally made Christianity spread for nearly two thousand years without decline. This shows the importance that humans attach to blood.

Once, in a small village in Connecticut, USA, a woman became seriously ill and was sent to a hospital in the city for treatment. Because a blood transfusion was needed, there was a public call for donors, and as a result, twenty-two people volunteered to respond. These twenty-two people waited all day at the hospital to donate blood, but nineteen of them were rejected because their blood types were incompatible.

One of them, named Nathan, felt that this method was too uneconomical, so he consulted with a pastor and initiated the organization of a blood donation society in Madison City. The call was widely heeded, and people who wanted to donate blood came in a continuous stream, and they only accepted sixty people as members. Chauffeurs, teachers, students, legionnaires, bank accountants, all kinds of people, everything you could want. They drew the blood and stored it in the blood bank in the hospital, which was regarded as the common property of all the people in Madison City. When poor patients needed blood transfusions, the blood donation society donated the blood. The members of the blood donation society used their blood to make all the people in the city blood relatives.

Some patients with better economic conditions paid the price of the blood transfusion as usual, and they saved this deposit as an emergency fund for members who became ill.

There is no shortage of public-spirited people willing to donate blood in other places. This kind of blood donation society can also be organized.

Family's Little Brother Has Half a Dozen Sisters Chen Wenyun

My little brother is only four years old this year. He is very smart and very talkative, so our six sisters all like him very much. Dad and Mom also, after having half a dozen daughters in a row, suddenly got this son who can be relied on in their forties, when they felt they were reaching old age, so naturally, they especially dote on him and like him especially.

Mom said that her little brother is the light before her feet; sometimes she said that her little brother is like a five-hundred-candlepower electric light that illuminates the whole family. In short, she thought that her little brother was the savior of the whole family. Indeed, that is the case. If I didn't have a younger brother now, then Dad would definitely take a concubine, especially since he has the grand reason that "Of the three unfilial things, having no descendants is the greatest." Fortunately, Dad read some ancient books and the like, and he has the skill of patience, and he is not very willing to listen to the advice of old busybodies in the countryside. He eagerly watched Mom's belly grow bigger day by day, and went east to have characters measured, and west to have fortunes told, busy and happy. As a result, his son's dream, which he had been longing for for ten months, completely vanished, and at the same time, third sister, fourth sister, fifth sister, and sixth sister came one after another, which really made him laugh and cry. Fortunately, he very much believed in the words of the blind fortune teller, knowing that he should have two sons in his life, and the later they came, the better, so every time he was disappointed, he would use the blind man's words to comfort himself.

Probably because there are often stories of getting a son by doing good deeds in old operas, Dad imitated the method and went to save the poor, buy rice tickets, and donate winter clothes.... Coincidentally, the birth of his younger brother was right after he had done good deeds, so Dad believed that his younger brother must be a star from heaven, otherwise how could it be so coincidental? So when he met friends who were in the same situation as him, he tried his best to persuade them to do good deeds and be patient, and even feared that people would not believe him, so he personally carried his younger brother to show them; therefore, all of Dad's friends knew that he had a son who he had gotten by doing good deeds. They all praised Dad, especially some female acquaintances, who were even more envious, which caused Mom and Dad to love their younger brother even more.

But what about us? Are we jealous because Mom and Dad are partial to our younger brother? Absolutely not: But I gradually began to hate my younger brother. It's not to say that my younger brother is not good, look, he is so cute, often calling me sister: giving me kisses with his little hands. However, what I hate is the pampered temperament and habits caused by Mom and Dad's doting. Although he is only four years old and still young, it is from this time that memories can engrave traces in his brain; his bright and excellent brain is waiting for a highly skilled craftsman to carve useful traces on it. But what about now? At the beginning, bad traces were left in his brain, how will they be washed away in the future?

I often hear my little brother's small mouth say: "Sister is a woman, I am a man, men are bosses, earn money, ride in cars... You women don't have any." Then he imitated the boss's smug look, which made Mom laugh and pat her younger brother's shoulder and say: "Baby, the money you earn is for Mom to use, not for your wife to use, women are the worst..." One sentence after another, in the young mind of the younger brother, he knows that only by scolding women will Mom always say he is good; later, when he goes to hit sixth sister, Mom says that women should be beaten by men. When eating, Mom says that the son should get an extra share; this makes the younger brother know the bad idea of valuing men over women, and develops a proud attitude. No one in the family dares to offend him.

He uses his little fist to hit Dad, and Dad laughs and says that his fist is big and he can go to beat servants in the future: he uses his little foot to kick Mom, and Mom praises him, saying that this is the demeanor of a boss. He scolds people, saying that he is smart, he hits people, saying that he is capable, so since he was born until now, in these short four years, he has learned to hit people, scold people, be proud, look down on women, servants... all kinds of young master bad tempers.

Although I have advised Mom and Dad not to spoil him too much, they said: "What do you want to manage? Daughters are always outsiders, and if they are kept tightly at home, they will be resigned to their fate and willing to suffer when they go out to be someone else's daughter-in-law in the future. Sons are family, the ancestors have accumulated virtue, the tombs have good feng shui, what is there to manage about him? Are you afraid that he will turn out to be so bad? He has his roots, he was cultivated in his previous life, you take care of yourself! Just don't do anything that will embarrass your brother!" Instead, I got a lecture.

But I still love my younger brother, and for the sake of loving my younger brother, I hate him, and at the same time, I feel sorry for him; but I have no way to save my younger brother. I only hope that Mom and Dad can wake up soon and transform my younger brother into a useful son, a son who is useful to the public.

Begonia Qin Shouou

(7) A Cross Drawn on the Face

When Qiu Haitang found him there that morning, he was lying sprawled on the wooden cot, and in his heavy snoring, bursts of strong alcoholic fumes were constantly being expelled.

"Lao Er, can you wake up?"

Even when he was sound asleep, a clever person was still clever; Qiu Haitang only called him softly, and Yu Kun woke up. But when Qiu Haitang explained his intentions, he was greatly unimpressed.

"What's the big fuss about? I've only slept for four hours, and you've rushed me here to wake me up!" He fastened the open short coat while saying angrily.

Qiu Haitang, with his hands behind his back, paced back and forth in the room, as if he hadn't heard anything, letting Yu Kun complain about him all the way while washing his face and changing his clothes.

"Because this guy has always been obsequious and clinging to me, but today he suddenly became so tough, as if he had grasped something, so I wanted to rush here to discuss it with you!" This room was really clean, without even half a stool. Every time Qiu Haitang came, he either walked around the room or leaned against the door frame like this, barely letting his body touch anything.

"Old brother, what's the hurry?" Yu Kun finally pulled up a pair of cloth-soled shoes with eyes and mouths on the heels, making a look of preparing to go out. "Send a few people to send him a letter today or tomorrow, tell him to be quiet, and then nothing will happen!"

Relying on his talent, his nimble speech, and the fact that he was quite generous when spending money, he couldn't live in Tianjin for three years. Not only did the actors who ate drama for a living praise him behind their backs, but even a few influential ruffians on the street said that Zhao Er, the owner of the Flying Grass, was a true man; therefore, in Yu Kun's eyes, a dog-relying-on-human-power orderly like Ji Zhaoxiong, as well as the unknown small gangsters he associated with, were indeed not worth caring about.

(8-9) Strange News Food Bank Xin Liang

We all know that banks are institutions for storing and withdrawing money. But did you know that in today's America, there is a new type of "food bank" that we can meet. According to statistics, one million families used this strange bank last year. When prices are low, they store beef, pork, beans, vegetables and orange juice, etc., and withdraw them when they want to eat them. This "food bank" has been in existence in the United States for five years, and its total funds have reached 30,000,000 gold dollars: it is also of great benefit to people's lives.

The creation of the "food bank" was born out of the previous type of cold storage, but we must not confuse it with the old method of cold storage. Experts in this field tell us: In the old method of cold storage, food is kept at zero degrees and will slowly freeze, and eventually lose its original flavor. The "food bank" does not adopt this method, but a high-speed freezing method. Because the size of ice crystals is directly proportional to the speed at which they freeze, the faster the freezing, the smaller the ice crystals, and the smaller the ice crystals, the less likely the food cells will rupture, and its color, aroma, and taste can be maintained in their original state, unaffected. The size of the "food bank" varies, with some that can simply be called "giant-sized," and all equipment is streamlined.

In addition to preserving the original quality of food, "food banks" also have the advantage of providing a place to store excess food. Farmers do not have to sell all their harvested food to merchants at low prices, allowing the merchants to hoard it and speculate. They can temporarily move unsold food to the bank, where there are excellent cold storage rooms to store them, and wait for the price to rise before withdrawing them.

In this way, the income of ordinary farmers should be higher than it is now, and they can use these extra profits to buy a few new clothes or buy a few new books and magazines.

This new type of business can also regulate our daily diet. When a certain seasonal item is no longer available in the market, because this type of bank exists, we can store some in advance and take it out when we want to eat it.

When a country goes to war, the contribution of this type of bank is even greater. We can store large quantities of military food in it for use when coastal ports are blockaded. As of the end of 1940, there were no fewer than 4,000 "food banks" in the United States; I believe that the function and effectiveness of "food banks" will be greatly developed in the shortest possible time.

Talks on Art and Entertainment: Chrysanthemum Garden Kuo Kunquan and Yuan Xiaolou Hong Da

A person can be lucky or unlucky, and opera singers are often no exception. For example, Li Wanchun, Yang Shengchun, Li Shaochun, and Gao Shenglin in the North are all short, but each of them has considerable appeal. Among the martial artists in the South, there are Kuo Kunquan and Yuan Xiaolou, who have never become popular in their lives because they are small. When it comes to their artistic skills, how are they any less than the several popular martial artists in the North?

Guo Kunquan is the grandson of Guo Xiuhua and the son of Guo Diexian. He comes from a family of actors. As a child, Kunquan used the stage name Guo Zhangyang. He could perform "Cutting Down Zidu," "Jiepai Pass," "Golden Knife Formation," "Yuehu City," and "Jiujiang Estuary." It can be said that he could perform any of them. Among them, the flying sword returning sword in "Cutting Down Zidu" is a unique skill that is foolproof. (Ru Fulan and Li Shengbin in the North can only fly the sword, but cannot return the sword. The one who can return the sword is the one who can still automatically enter the sword box after the sword is flown out.) Although he has also been on stage, he eventually returned to the entertainment venue, where he made a living by performing and also talked about opera for amateur opera lovers. His current situation is of course not very good.

Yuan Xiaolou is the descendant of Yuan Beifeng and also comes from a family of actors. The Opera Examination published by the China Library has a photo of a seven- or eight-year-old child actor climbing the Chaotian bench. The child actor in this photo is Yuan Xiaolou. Judging from this photo, Yuan Xiaolou's childhood skills are unmatched by any child actor. Yuan Xiaolou's plays are limited by his height, but he is excellent in short-play and arrow-robe plays. I have seen his "Cutting Down Zidu." The tumbling in the golden hall is more explosive than Ying Baolian, who became famous for throwing himself out of the table. Although Li Shengbin in the North is also famous for this play, his skills are far inferior to Yuan Xiaolou. Yuan Xiaolou's agility, flexibility of waist and legs, the appropriateness of his makeup, and the clarity of his singing are all admirable to see. Other plays such as "Zhou Yu Returns to Heaven," "Tang Huai Commits Suicide," "Pan Chang Great Battle," "Killing the Four Gates," and "Changban Slope" are all worth watching. In the Old Shanghai Dance Hall, I also saw him play Yao Gang in "Beating the Golden Bricks" for Xiao Dazi, Yu Shaoshan, and Li Wan. The wonderful somersaults, the complexity of the hammer flowers, and the agility made Li Wanchun, who played Niumao, pale in comparison. Later, I saw him sing Guan Ping in "Walking Maicheng" at the Golden Palace, and there were too many amazing things. I have seen Li Wanchun and Liang Huichao both play Guan Ping in this play for Li Hongchun, but their tumbling and falling are not as explosive as Yuan Xiaolou. The hair, kneeling steps, sitting positions, and round field are not as skillful as Yuan Xiaolou. Now he has also fallen into the entertainment venue, which is a pity!

If Guo Kunquan and Yuan Xiaolou were born in the North, I dare say that they would never be in their current position. Unfortunately, they grew up in Shanghai, where there happened to be many tall martial artists (such as Ying Baolian, Gai Yuting, Gao Xueqiao, Wang Yingwu, and Wang Huchen, none of whom are short). Therefore, Yuan Xiaolou and Guo Kunquan have never become popular.

Second Honeymoon Li Du

Diana Bowping and Feng Paul's wedding had been rumored for a long time. According to Hollywood movie magazines, it was originally scheduled to take place on June 9th of this year. However, for some reason, the two of them could not wait and got married earlier.

Bowping loves music the most, so she got married in a church. According to Bowping, the reason why she wanted to get married in a church was because she loved listening to the solemn wedding march. That day, Mendelssohn and Wenger Nair played the piano, taking turns to play two wedding marches, with extremely quiet and solemn melodies.

Whether it was superstition or personal preference, Bowping also wanted to have two honeymoons after the wedding. The first honeymoon was to stay in Honolulu for six months, which was similar to her situation in It's a Date. After returning from Honolulu, she would travel to New York again, where she planned to enjoy stage operas.

The gift that Feng Paul gave her when he announced his marriage was an exquisite diamond ring and a bracelet. Her engagement ring was also given by Feng Paul, but it was smaller. The first gift that Feng Paul gave her after the wedding was a watch.

An Outline of the Philosophy of Action Li Xing

Movement is the source of life, and life is the result of movement. Whoever leaves movement has no future. Because without movement there is no life, and without life there is destruction. This is an iron law. The so-called non-birth and non-extinction, beyond the scope of movement, seeking its existence, is just a kind of fantasy!

Blood Rain Qiong Pa Gu Mingdao

Chapter 7: Why Are Attacking Cities and Killing Generals So Chaotic?

Yi and Li Xin killed their way out of the Yanshu and set off a signal cannon to gather their men. Just as they were about to rush out of the city, they heard a呜呜 sound of bugles on the street to the west, followed by bright torches and a chaotic mix of people and horses. It turned out that General Feng heard the bad news of the prison break and summoned his troops to encircle and capture them. Li Xin said to Hong Niangzi, "The government troops are coming. Where should we go?" Hong Niangzi said, "Don't panic. I'll resist for a while. My brother's men will be here soon." As the two were speaking, the government troops had already rushed from the opposite alley. The streets of Qixian were very narrow, with no room to maneuver, and both sides were already visible. General Feng was a young and strong general, in full military attire, riding a yellow horse, and holding a large broadsword. Seeing a group of bandits from Qing Shi Mountain on the opposite side, armed and lined up, he shouted loudly, urged his horse, and charged straight at them. Hong Niangzi raised her sword to meet him and shouted娇, "Hong Niangzi is here!" General Feng had heard of Hong Niangzi's name, and knew that she often wore red and was extremely brave. Now, seeing the woman coming to kill him under the firelight, although she was very beautiful, she was wearing black, and he seemed a little suspicious. But hearing her call herself Hong Niangzi, he dared not neglect her, and raised his broadsword, aiming at her head to chop down. Hong Niangzi would not let him, and her sword danced. General Feng fought fiercely back and forth. The government troops under General Feng followed and charged up, and Li Xin and his men went forward to meet them, and the two sides fought in the alley. General Feng's martial arts were very good, but because of the alley war, he had no room to gallop. Hong Niangzi was agile, and her sword was very nimble, suddenly in front, suddenly behind the horse, tiring General Feng with sweat all over his head, and he knew that the name Hong Niangzi was indeed worthy of the name. Li Xin also used his Pu Dao to open up his skills and stabbed down three or four government soldiers. Just as they were in a stalemate, three signal cannons were fired outside the city, and someone came to report to General Feng's army, saying that a large number of men from Qing Shi Mountain had killed their way to outside the city of Qixian, there were few soldiers on the city and few people to guard it, and the city gate was about to be taken. General Feng got this news, and he did not know how many men had come from Qing Shi Mountain, there were both in the city and outside the city, and he was very flustered. He made a false move and ran away with his horse. Hong Niangzi looked back at Li Xin and said with a smile, "My brother is here, let's rush up and take this city of Qixian while we have the chance."

Recent Events in Shadow City Xia Sha

In I Wanted Wings, there are several scenes that are very dangerous. This is a great air combat film. The stars William Holden and Wayne Morris were both covered with fireproof burn oil. The makeup was done by Hollywood's most famous makeup expert, Max Factor.

Bette Davis plays the world's most miserable orphan in her new film The Great Lie. There were several crying scenes that indeed made it impossible for her to work on the set the next day because her eye nerves were too tired. This film will probably earn a small number of viewers' tears again.

### Medical Stories

— Qingping

Taking medicine after becoming ill is not as good as preventing illness early and maintaining health.

Fifty years ago, missionary medical personnel from Western churches in China organized the "Medical Association," led by foreigners, to oversee medical affairs in China. This included promoting medical education, improving medical facilities, and disseminating health knowledge, thus laying the foundation for modern medicine in our country. People of insight then began to study Western medical techniques, and the public gradually learned to seek treatment from Western doctors. Consequently, Western medicine began to sprout in our country. At that time, advanced medical professionals who had studied abroad and returned to China believed that although the efforts and achievements of foreigners who were in charge of China's medical affairs were worthy of admiration, it was not an ideal solution. Chinese people should have their own medical organizations, and China's medical affairs should be managed by Chinese people. Thus, they organized the Chinese Medical Association, which now has nearly thirty years of history. After the establishment of the Chinese Medical Association, the Missionary Medical Association, organized by foreigners, dissolved. Foreign medical experts still strongly supported the development of the Chinese Medical Association. It now has three thousand members, including six hundred foreign members. This is the national academic medical institution, and with the strong support of the government, it has made significant contributions to our country's medical affairs. The association's address is at 41 Zhuhong Road, Shanghai.

The Chinese Medical Association possesses a very rich collection of our country's ancient medical literature, including photos, models, idols, medical instruments, medical books, and more of ancient Chinese medicine. According to Wang Jimin, President of the Chinese Medical History Association, the Chinese Medical Association has the best collection of Chinese medical books. People from the traditional Chinese medicine community often go there to borrow and consult them. These ancient medical documents were collected and gathered by Wang over the years and have been carefully researched.

After Dr. Ouyang Zhong accompanied me on a tour of the two medical museum rooms, an outline of the history of Chinese medicine emerged in my mind.

In a small room upstairs, important figures and patterns from the history of medicine were hung on the surrounding walls. There was a comparison of Chinese and foreign medical history. Since our country's Yellow Emperor wrote the Inner Canon and initiated medicine, and Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs and obtained medical knowledge (2400 BC), up to the medical theories of the Five Elements (1000 BC) and the Eight Trigrams (500 BC), and then Zhang Zhongjing and Hua Tuo of the Han Dynasty (the time of Jesus's birth), Chinese medicine greatly flourished. Zhang Zhongjing of the Han Dynasty was our country's master of internal medicine, and his Treatise on Cold Damage is still regarded as a classic of national medicine. Hua Tuo once scraped bone to treat General Guan Yu of the Three Kingdoms, pioneering anesthesia in our country and becoming a master of surgery in our country. In another frame was a genuine prescription written by the famous physician Ye Tianshi of the Qing Dynasty. He was famous for treating plagues, using pungent and cold substances to open blockages, and fragrant substances to expel impurities. He was the ancestor of plague treatment in our country. There was a portrait of Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty, who spent twenty-seven years completing the unprecedented Chinese medical masterpiece "Compendium of Materia Medica," which is the culmination of Chinese medicine. In addition, there was a drawing of the so-called "pulse diagnosis by thread," depicting a "doctor" and several maids. The maids held a thread in their hands, and the "doctor" pressed on the thread to take the pulse and diagnose the condition. Because ancient China was bound by old ethics, and men and women were not allowed to touch each other, if a young lady in her boudoir unfortunately fell ill, she could not reveal her fair skin to the doctor. Her delicate jade arm could not be given to the doctor to take the pulse. So, a clever method was devised in stubborn minds. A silk thread was used. One maid tightly pressed one end of the thread on the part of the sick lady's jade arm where the pulse was, and another maid held the other end of the thread and led it to the outer room of the bedroom. The doctor pressed the pulse in the middle of the thread. The thread slightly jumped with the pulse's movement, and the doctor diagnosed the condition based on the thread's jumping and prescribed medicine accordingly. The doctor never saw how pale and haggard the sick lady actually was. This kind of "pulse diagnosis by thread" is of the same nature as another method of diagnosis using nude female models. If a lady had a disease in a certain part of her body, the patient's family would point it out to the doctor on this nude model, and then the doctor would prescribe medicine based on the diseased part of the model that was pointed out. In ancient times, when women got sick, they were treated in this unsatisfactory way. (To be continued)

### The Tianjin Road Joint Savings Bank Was Bombed and Shot at Yesterday; Both Sides Exchanged Fire for a Long Time, and the Situation Was Tense; the Watchman and Security Guard Were Both Shot and Injured

Yesterday at 9:30 AM, six men suddenly appeared at the Joint Savings Commercial Bank at 201 Tianjin Road, in the Public Concession. They took out pistols and revolvers and started shooting inside. One of them threw two hand grenades inside, but they did not explode. As soon as the shooting started, the bank's guard, Lang Deming (age 47, from Jiangsu), and security guards also drew their guns and returned fire. A fierce gun battle erupted, with both sides firing a total of more than 40 shots. Neighbors and pedestrians were terrified and fled in all directions. The men, seeing that they had no chance of succeeding, fled, boarded a car that was waiting for them, and sped away. After the incident, the police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, who rushed to the scene and sent Lang Deming, who was wounded in the shooting, and security guard Chen Afang (age 36) to Renji Hospital for treatment. Lang was hit by two bullets in the back and head, while Chen was shot in the left finger and suffered minor injuries. Several panes of the bank's glass windows were shattered. Stray bullets also penetrated the Yuanmao Ginseng Shop at 190 opposite the bank, breaking the glass windows, but fortunately no one was injured. It was also reported that the police had found one revolver, two pistols, and two unexploded hand grenades at the scene of the incident, which were all taken to the police station for storage.

### A Bomb Was Discovered at the Ruiji Flour Shop; the Bomber Was Intercepted

The Ruiji Flour Shop at 127 North Zhejiang Road, named Ruilu, is owned by Pan Ruijie from Baoshan. It has its own car, license plate number 3524. Recently, it has been coveted by bandits. On the 24th of last month, several kidnappers attempted to kidnap Pan at the entrance of the shop. Fortunately, the driver was alert and Pan was saved from being kidnapped, but the kidnappers fired a shot at Pan, hitting his right ankle. The bandits then fled. At around 7:40 this morning, a strong man suddenly placed a paper package behind the Ruiji shop and fled north. As he fled to the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road, he was spotted by Hua San Daotou, number 1087, and Hua Police 3012, who were stationed at the entrance of the First Special Court by the Huizi Police Station to provide protection. Seeing that the man was flustered and did not appear to be a good person, they immediately chased after him and captured him. At this time, the Ruiji shop had also discovered that the paper package contained a bomb and immediately took it to the police station. After interrogation, the man identified himself as Zheng Huili, a local. A warrant was issued to arrest his accomplices for further investigation.

### Bandits Broke into the Guide Agency and Opened Fire; a Noodle Stall Owner Was Shot and Killed; a Partner Was Shot in the Leg

Last night around 10:00 PM, three men, all armed with pistols, broke into the Taotao Guide Agency at No. 10, Guangxi Road (i.e., Jingqinfang). One of them stood guard outside. The guide girls inside the agency saw the two men with pistols and were terrified, shouting for help. The man who was standing guard outside suspected that something had happened and ran away. The three men then fled into the darkness. When the men fired their guns, the bullets flew in all directions. Chen Pinfa, who owned a noodle stall in front of the Taotao Agency, was hit first, with four shots to the chest. Because the bullets hit vital organs, he collapsed in a pool of blood and died on the spot. Two partners of the noodle stall, Shu Pinfang, age 36, from Changzhou, and Han Zhiben, age 19, also from Changzhou, were both shot and wounded in the leg. After the Chinese police reported the incident to the police station, detectives were dispatched to investigate. The body of Chen Pin and the two partners were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because Chen Pinfa could not be saved, his body was sent to the morgue to await examination.

### A Man and Woman Commit Suicide by Poisoning in the Shanghai New Hotel

Room 200 of the Shanghai New Hotel at 579 Jiujiang Road in the Public Concession was occupied by a young man and woman. The male guest was named Chen Yiming, age 20, a local, and the female guest was named Wang Huizhen, age 17, a local. Around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the waiter discovered that both the man and woman had committed suicide by swallowing poison. He immediately called an ambulance and sent the two to Renji Hospital for treatment. Chen Yiming died before reaching the hospital due to severe poisoning. Wang Huizhen's life was in critical condition. The reason for their suicide was said to be unhappiness over an arranged marriage.

### Over a Thousand Food Snatching Cases Occur Daily

Since the price of rice and coal has been illegally manipulated, residents' lives have been greatly threatened. The number of beggars along the streets has also increased significantly. Because it is difficult to beg for alms, the trend of snatching food on the streets and alleys has become rampant. Snatching is considered normal, especially in small vegetable markets. Even in the Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road area, where there are usually many police and detectives and the streets are crowded with pedestrians, a dozen or so cases of snatching food packages and other items occur daily. According to detailed statistics, there are over a thousand food snatching incidents daily. According to an economist, the occurrence of these incidents is purely a result of hoarding and speculation, which greatly disrupts public order.
