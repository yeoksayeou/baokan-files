### The Far East Situation Becomes Increasingly Urgent; US President Decides to Return to Capital Early; Hull and Halifax Hold Another Long Talk; Tojo Makes Speech Reproaching Britain and the US Yesterday

Havas News Agency, Thermopolis, 30th – President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Polio Relief Association here yesterday, expressing the hope that next Thanksgiving, the peoples of all invaded countries could also celebrate the holiday like the Americans. He concluded by saying that the students of the US Army and Navy academies would have the opportunity to rise up and defend their national heritage in the future. After delivering this speech, the President returned to his private residence and had a long-distance telephone conversation with Secretary of State Hull that evening, exchanging views for quite some time. Afterwards, the President announced that he would depart today to return to the capital, in order to arrive back in Washington D.C. before noon on the 1st. It is generally believed that the President's sudden return is related to the tough speech made by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo.

International News Agency, Thermopolis, 30th – President Roosevelt suddenly cut short his vacation and returned to the capital today. The reason seems to be the deteriorating situation in the Pacific. The President's secretary told the press, "Japanese Prime Minister Tojo made a declaration in Tokyo," accusing Britain and the United States of obstructing Japan's establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the development of the Far East. Secretary of State Hull reported this to the President by telephone, and the President immediately changed his plans. Shortly after the President returned to the capital, he declared, "Students in our army and navy schools will fight next year to defend their schools."

Reuters, Washington, 30th – Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that there was nothing to say about the US-Japan situation until the Japanese government expressed its attitude towards the US official document received by the Japanese ambassador. When asked whether Japan's invasion of Thailand would cause a conflict in the Pacific, Hull did not answer this, saying only that it should be asked of the Navy and Army departments. Hull had a discussion with British Ambassador Halifax yesterday about the Far East situation for about an hour.

Reuters, Tokyo, 30th – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo published an article, which included the statement that "The hostile countries including Britain and the United States are now planning to develop East Asia, regardless of the interests of the 1 billion people in East Asia. For the sake of human dignity, we must sweep away this kind of behavior from East Asia."

United Press, Tokyo, 30th – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo yesterday evening condemned third countries for attempting to interfere with Japan's plan to establish a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and said, "Interference with this co-prosperity sphere cannot be tolerated." He said, "Many countries are engaging in hostile actions against this co-prosperity sphere, attempting to obstruct our path, sacrificing the people of Asia, and plundering Asia to satisfy their greed for occupation." Tojo reiterated Japan's determination to consolidate the Asian front, "so that the song of victory can be sung as soon as possible in the camp of justice."

Reuters, London, 30th – An article published today by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, and the arguments of Japanese newspapers criticizing Britain and the United States, have reduced the hope for a peaceful resolution in the Pacific. General opinion is that the urgency of the situation and the United States' approach to war with Japan have never been greater than today. The Sunday Chronicle commented on the Japanese Prime Minister's essay, saying that Hitler is now trying to persuade Japan to pull chestnuts out of the fire for him, so that he can sacrifice other countries to fulfill his ambition to dominate the world. Although news dispatches from Washington and New York are worded in a somber tone, they do not believe that a conflict in the Pacific is likely to occur immediately. The Sunday Times correspondent in New York wired that even if Kurusu decides to return to his country, if no other ominous actions occur at the same time, it may not mean that the talks have completely broken down. Although some quarters expect a crisis to be imminent, many observers still do not advocate rushing to conclusions about the developments in the near future.

### Japanese Newspaper Threatens the United States, Saying Negotiations Will Be Suspended

United Press, Tokyo, 30th – Tokyo Japanese newspapers warned today that if the United States continues its reactionary strategy and intensifies the ABCD countries' encirclement policy against Japan in the Pacific, Japan will soon be forced to withdraw from the Washington negotiations. If any accidents occur at that time, the United States should be responsible, it was said. The Sino-Foreign Business Daily commented and warned that if the conditions proposed by the United States are contrary to Japan's unchanged policy, the Washington negotiations will not be able to end satisfactorily.

United Press, Tokyo, 30th – Authoritative sources said that Japan's reply to the United States' minimum demand for a Pacific reconciliation note expressed dissatisfaction, including some undisclosed basic points. Those who previously expressed optimism about the possibility of establishing an agreement with the United States have now visibly weakened. The basic points of disagreement have not been revealed, but it is recalled that the United States once demanded that Japanese troops withdraw from China and Vietnam, and abandon their ties with the Axis powers, while guaranteeing to maintain the status quo. Previously, it was unofficially said that the United States was not actually coping with the Far East.

Reuters, Hanoi, 30th – News from Washington is eagerly awaited here. It is expected that within 72 hours, there will be concrete news about the outcome of the US-Japan talks. According to general speculation, what can be achieved is a compromise that, although neither side is willing to make concessions, can prevent a major war from breaking out in the Far East. The actions of the Japanese army in Vietnam have not exceeded the permitted scope. However, the Japanese army knows for sure that the military and spiritual strength of the Thai army must make it disloyal before attacking Thailand, so that it will not feel too difficult. However, the season for permissible military activities is only three months from now. After this, the climate will be unfavorable for marching again. Roughly, any ceasefire measure by the United States will delay the danger for a year. The Governor-General of Vietnam will definitely give British and American people all possible protection in the event of war. The Lanfa-Japanese Agreement is only defensive in nature.

### The United States Has a Firm Attitude and Is Prepared to Meet the Challenge

United Press, New York, 30th – Former State Department Advisor Dennett gave a speech to the Foreign Relations Association yesterday, saying that Japan and the United States have always been natural allies, and will continue to be so. However, Japan's "political madness has changed American public opinion. At this moment, we are prepared to meet Japan's challenge, and we will seek a way out through war." He pointed out that the United States' withdrawal from its Far East policy, with allowing the Philippines independence as its most obvious aspect. He said, "The reason why the United States' policy changed midway was due to Japan's mad violence and radical economic policies." He also said that today, the United States will not allow any country to establish a monopoly in the Far East. Therefore, Kurusu's visit to the United States this time is to explore whether the Americans are prepared for war. He can return to his country and tell the government. Let him remember to say goodbye to his friends here as he crosses the Pacific. Mr. Freiles, a famous writer, journalist, and editor of the Japanese-knowing Times, also gave a speech at the same luncheon, saying, "Japan, like Hitler before, is creating an excuse for Danzig to attack Poland, so we will see Japan's second step will lead to a Pacific War. What Japan wants to counterattack is not Thailand or any other particular place, but Japan's extensive policy of aggression." He also said that the United States is closer to war with Japan than at any time in history. I believe that if Japan further invades the South Pacific, we will never hesitate and will stop it by force. He also vehemently criticized the Japanese military, saying, "They control the fate of Japan, but they cannot understand the words of principles, treaties, and doctrines. Mr. Luce, the chief writer and publisher of Time Magazine, Life Magazine, and Fortune Magazine, also criticized Japan's policies and goals, and praised China for fighting for freedom, believing that China truly represents a republic, or even more so than any other country in the world."

United Press, London, 30th – Today, the headlines of major British newspapers are mostly "The US and Japan are on the Verge of War." However, some editorials suggest that the two Pacific countries may still be able to reach an agreement. The Daily Mail said that if Japan withdraws its troops stationed in southern Vietnam, the United States may relax its economic sanctions and agree to Japan stationing a small number of troops in northern Vietnam. The newspaper pointed out that mutual guarantees of non-aggression in the South Pacific and Southeast and Northeast Asia could complete the US plan for a three-month US-Japan agreement. British estimates indicate that there are approximately 85,000 Japanese troops in French Indochina, but some sources say 100,000. The best guess in diplomatic circles is that Japanese special envoy Kurusu will remain in Washington for at least the short term. All newspapers expect that even if talks continue with difficulty, they will fail.

### Alexander Gives a Speech, Saying the Far East Crisis Has Reached the Stage of Explosion

United Press, Blackpool, 30th – British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, in his opening speech at the celebration of Warship Week yesterday, warned the people of the country that Japan was approaching the brink of regrettable action, and said that the Far East crisis was at the stage of explosion. He heard "Japanese leaders say that Japan is at a crossroads, but who led them into the past?" He replied himself, "Their soldiers did." He also said, "I believe that some wise men in Japan already know that one end of the crossroads is the road to destruction. I believe that some Japanese leaders will make wiser advice and not immediately join the war." He also said, "If Japan is willing to cooperate with the side of justice and reason, no one can deny that the country will gain a glorious position in the East." He also said that Japan should not hope to gain any benefits from Hitler. Cooperation between Italy and Germany can serve as a warning.

### It Is Rumored That Germany and Japan Will Cooperate Closely in the Far East; This Move May Be the Result of the Crisis; Democratic Countries Decide to Deal with It Jointly

United Press, Washington, 30th – Well-informed sources predicted today that Germany and Japan will cooperate more closely to drive British and American interests out of the Far East. Observers believe that the United States is now waiting for Japan's reply to the United States' basic Pacific stance in the Far East. This move by Germany and Japan may be the result of the Pacific crisis. It is generally believed that Japan cooperating with the Axis powers in the Pacific is more likely than accepting the conditions of the United States. These observers said that if Japan is disappointed with the US-Japan talks, it may reverse its past passive cooperation attitude and actively cooperate with the Axis powers, providing the Axis countries with sufficient supply stations and fuel depots, so that Nazi raiding fleets can maintain a strong fleet in the Pacific. This raiding fleet will attack British shipping, and Germany will also help Japan cut off US supplies to China. Some quarters say that no matter what Japan does, the US, Britain, and the Netherlands will deal with it in a joint action, which is almost without a doubt. However, what the nature of the action will be is still an absolute official secret. Senator Geeside of the Democratic Party of Illinois said that he learned from reliable unofficial sources that Hitler had assured Japan that he could help Japan with a large military force by February next year, and said that by January, Vichy would be forced to hand over its fleet to Germany for dispatch. He said that he believed that the US and Japan could not achieve anything except a delayed peace. He also said that he knew that Kurusu's visit this time was requested by Hitler, with the aim of delaying the US-Japan talks until Germany was able to help Japan invade Thailand. Senator Connally of the Texas Democratic Party and chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that if Japan attacks Thailand, he advocated "intensifying economic pressure on Japan, and also concentrating some of our country's fleets in the South Pacific to ensure that our country's rights and interests will not be damaged." Senator George of the Georgia Democratic Party said that he believed Japan was trying to "get out of trouble by bragging," but admitted that "the war may expand to both oceans before the start of the war in the East. The day will come when, if Japan does not take action to expand the war to the Pacific, it will make a cooperative adjustment." Fan Zhi said that he believed the United States' Far East position was "mostly economic and commercial in nature," but the cooperation between Britain and the United States to avoid war "may exceed the scope of economics." He also said that the United States was very interested in avoiding the expansion of the war to the Pacific, while Japan was unwilling to let the Soviet Union fail before it could profit from it.

### Duff Cooper Returns to Singapore

Reuters, Singapore, 30th – British Cabinet Minister for the Far East Duff Cooper returned here today and will report the results of his discussions with the governments of Australia and New Zealand to London. British Deputy Commander of the Middle East Command, General Brehmer, also arrived on the same flight and will return to the Middle East after a three- or four-day stay.

### International Briefs

Reuters, Nairobi, 30th – A public announcement said that there are still several military outposts of the army in the Gondar region of Abyssinia that have not surrendered. British planes have been dropping a surrender letter prepared by an Italian general to these outposts.

Reuters, New York, 30th – According to the US Customs statistics for October, the shipping industry in New York Harbor is still very prosperous, with a total of 546 ships sailing out, totaling approximately 2 million tons, of which 38 were foreign flags.

Reuters, Hong Kong, 30th – The Hong Kong branch of the Japanese Allied News Agency will suspend its communication services from tomorrow because Hong Kong has frozen Japanese funds and cannot obtain remittances from Tokyo.

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 30th – According to news from Kubischif, the Soviet TASS News Agency issued a formal declaration this morning denying the claim that Britain and the Soviet Union had held negotiations before the outbreak of war on the Eastern Front.

Reuters, Berlin, 30th – According to news from Helsinki, the Finnish official court issued an order yesterday that before the end of next year, the Bank of Finland shall be exempt from the obligation to exchange banknotes for gold.

### US 16th Naval District Announces Implementation of Blackout; If War Breaks Out, the US Will Send Planes to Bomb Japan; Singapore Cancels Soldiers' Leave and Intensifies Preparations

United Press, Manila, 30th – The US 16th Naval District and its base, Cavite City, announced yesterday "an indefinite blackout." The city government approved the emergency decree proposed by the Navy and the preventive measures taken by the naval authorities. US Marines, sailors, and Philippine guards and soldiers, together with the police, are patrolling the roads to assist in the implementation of the blackout.

United Press, Washington, 30th – Reliable sources say that the Philippine army has now been incorporated into the US Far East Command and will soon be organized into three military districts. This area will not only include Luzon, but will also include the southern islands and Mindanao, where many Japanese people live. The organization of this force will be semi-independent to promote the highest degree of flexibility. The general impression is that the US preparations in the Philippines are progressing greatly and are sufficient to cope with any eventuality.

United Press, Washington, 30th – Mr. Rapp, a well-known commentator for the Howard newspapers, wrote yesterday that US officials are solemnly accusing Japan of encircling the Philippines, and we are therefore building fortifications in our jurisdiction. This statement is because the highest government authorities said last Friday that Japan's invasion of China and Vietnam has established a horseshoe-shaped encirclement of the Philippine Islands. It also said that once the war breaks out, the Japanese fleet will probably concentrate near Japan, while the US fleet will guard Hawaii for protection, because there is no sufficient base between Hawaii and Singapore. Mr. Kerabrappu said that the main action of the United States should be to use submarines and planes based in the Philippines to carry out large-scale activities, or send planes from the Philippines to bomb Japan. The war is bound to proceed slowly and continue for a year or two. Final victory is undoubtedly certain, so it is doubtful whether Japan will allow the war to break out. The greatest danger is that Japan will make a wrong estimate and fall into war.

Reuters, Singapore, 30th – Soldiers' leave was cancelled last night. Those in charge said that in view of the situation in the Pacific, this was a routine precautionary action.

### Japan Denies Attacking Thailand; British Troops Increase Defense of Rangoon

United Press, Tokyo, 30th – An official spokesman for the Ministry of the Army today absolutely denied the news that Japanese troops had already entered Thailand. United Press, Singapore, 30th – An official military spokesman announced today that a large number of British and Indian troops have arrived in Rangoon to increase defense. The newly arrived troops include various soldiers, and many of them have served on other battlefields. Last night, cinemas in Singapore suddenly showed orders on the screen ordering all soldiers to return to their camps immediately. After the troops returned to their camps, they were ordered to prepare, but authoritative sources expect the order to be revoked within 48 hours. The order is only a precautionary measure and does not include the Navy and the Australian Army. Regarding the rumors from London that Japan has already attacked Thailand, authoritative sources believe that this statement is still too early.

Reuters, Bangkok, 30th – The Bangkok official radio station commented last night on the news broadcast by the American radio station that Japanese troops in southern Vietnam are preparing to invade Thai territory immediately when Tokyo orders it, saying that Thailand will not be attacked by Japanese troops, because Japan will guarantee friendship with Thailand.

United Press, New York, 30th – Last night, London rumored that Japanese troops had attacked Thailand. However, the British Foreign Office said that it had not received any information about the rumors. The extreme concern of Britain and the United States about the situation in the Pacific is already very obvious. The cancellation of military leave in Singapore coincides with the belief here that Japan may launch an attack somewhere at the end of this week. Unofficial sources in Washington said that Tokyo is clearly desperate, because Japan believes that the talks in Washington are on the verge of collapse. The sources said that Japan may launch an attack in an attempt to "break through the encirclement." American newspapers all headlined the crisis in the East.

United Press, Bangkok, 30th – Thai newspapers reported that the US embassy in Thailand has advised American expatriates in Thailand to prepare to evacuate in an emergency.

### Soviet Union Announces Victory on the Southern Front; Red Army Recaptures Rostov; Four German Divisions Are Defeated; 5,000 Killed in Action; Threat to Caucasus Oil Fields Greatly Reduced

TASS, Moscow, 30th – The Soviet Information Bureau issued a special communique stating that several days ago, the German army suddenly occupied Zastov. On the 28th, our army, under the leadership of Limosov, crossed the Don River and broke into the southern part of Rostov City to fight the enemy. At the same time, the Red Army of Kalitov broke into the city from the northeast and occupied the city. As a result of the fierce fighting, the German 14th and 16th Tank Divisions, the 60th Motorized Division, and the SS 1st Division, a total of four divisions under the guidance of Christoff, have been completely defeated. The enemy army retreated towards Tannenbörg, and the Red Army is pursuing closely. 5,000 enemy bodies were left on the battlefield. Our army seized many spoils of war.

TASS, Moscow, 30th – After the Red Army recaptured Rostov City on the southern front, it continued to advance. Fascist tanks and artillery units retreated in panic. Christoff, the famous German commander-in-chief on the southern front, also fled from Tagenrog to Marioppo. Our cavalry is particularly diligent in pursuing the defeated enemy army. In addition, the Red Army also achieved victories at other points on the southern front. The Soviet air force is very active. In the past 24 hours, it shot down enemy aircraft and destroyed 200 military vehicles carrying enemy soldiers.

TASS, Moscow, 30th – After the Red Army's great victory on the southern front and the recapture of Rostopff, Stalin has telegraphed congratulations to Marshal Dimoshchenko, the commander-in-chief of the southern front, Major General Chiriweizheng Guo, and the entire Red Army that contributed to the victory. In addition, during the Red Army's counterattack on Rostopff this time, the German army resisted fiercely, and the Red Army encountered many difficulties. The Don River was not completely frozen. The Red Army's tanks and artillery units did not participate. Only the infantry and cavalry attacked. After the Red Army broke into the south, it engaged in street fighting with the enemy for two days.

United Press, London, 30th – Soviet forces yesterday recaptured the city of Rostov on the Don River. In this astonishing counterattack, 5,000 German soldiers were killed in action, thus repelling the German threat to the Caucasus oil fields. Berlin military circles denied that Soviet forces had recaptured the city, but acknowledged that German forces had withdrawn from the important theater. The recapture of Rostov is the Soviet Union's first decisive victory since the German invasion began, and it is in marked contrast to the serious threat the German army has posed to the Don River area and Moscow in recent days. Baku will be a greater prize to Hitler than the Suez Canal, but unless the German army can retake Rostov and hold it securely, this gateway to the Caucasus cannot be occupied.

Haitong News Agency, Headquarters of the German Head of State, 30th – The German Supreme Command announced today that the German forces and air force in Rostov and the Tangnaizi Basin cooperated and launched a major melee yesterday, causing the attacking Soviet forces to flee in disarray, suffering heavy losses. In the east of Taijilowan, the oil depot established by the Soviet army was breached, and German bombers dropped bombs to set it on fire. German infantry and tank columns attacked the Moscow area and seized a lot of food. The Soviet army on the Leningrad front, with the help of tanks, launched a powerful offensive, which was finally repelled by the German army. German bombers continued to carry out destructive work on the northern front. Important railway projects along the Maomansike line were destroyed. The airfields and railways in the southern and central lines were also attacked by German aircraft, causing heavy damage. Leningrad and Moscow were bombed during the daytime.

### Red Army Continues Counterattack and Crosses Volga River

TASS, Karining, 30th – Our army continued to counterattack in the Karining area on the 28th. Fierce fighting raged throughout the night. The German army was driven out of several villages. Our army also crossed the frozen Volga River at several points. The Red Army teams of Stevepanov and Koloson Ge are both gradually advancing. On the 27th, the troops of Koloson Ge recaptured three villages. Although the enemy attempted to counterattack, they were still repelled. Our army captured a large number of German prisoners, who belonged to the 58th Regiment of the 6th Division. Their feet were frozen and they could not walk. In some areas, the enemy has gradually retreated. Our army continued to capture many important points.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th – Authoritative sources announced yesterday afternoon that Volokolamsk, a military stronghold on the Riga-Moscow railway line, had fallen into the hands of the German army. The town is an important intersection of the railway in the Moscow area, so it is extremely important militarily.

TASS, Crimea, 30th – In the Crimea, the enemy army continues to reinforce its offensive, and the threat to Sebasstopol is increasing. The enemy occupies important heights leading into the town. The Red Army, with the assistance of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, is firmly holding its position. Yesterday, the enemy army occupied a certain height and continued to capture an important point. The Black Sea Fleet bombarded the enemy army and also inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy in terms of manpower and materiel.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th – It was announced here last night that the German army, after occupying the port and resort of Bulaklava at the southern end of the Crimean Peninsula, had approached Sebasstopol.

Editorial: Review of Japan's Movements

Since US Secretary of State Hull delivered the American fundamental principles to Kurusu on the 26th of last month, the various rumors and optimistic atmosphere that had prevailed in recent days have turned into tension and preparation for war. General opinion holds that the outbreak of a crisis in the Far East is almost inevitable. However, the parties involved, the US and Japanese authorities, are currently maintaining extreme calm and silence. The rumor that Japanese troops will immediately attack Thailand has yet to be proven. This is naturally the silence before the storm, but it may also be that some still expect a chance for a turnaround, although both sides admit that this hope is extremely weak. Moreover, while many are pleased that the US attitude appears strong, some are also eagerly hoping that a compromise can be reached. Therefore, rather than making premature predictions about future developments at this juncture, it would be better to analyze Japan's situation and its movements and interests, because the course of action taken by the Japanese authorities at this time is undoubtedly the main key to the future situation.

The difficulties Japan faces at this moment are unprecedented since the Meiji Restoration. In the past, Japan did make concessions due to overwhelming international pressure, such as the Triple Intervention's return of Liaodong and the Washington Naval Conference. However, at that time, its national power was growing, and its foundation was not shaken. Making some concessions avoided a major crisis in foreign relations, which may have been fortunate for Japan. Now, four years of prolonged war have exhausted Japan's accumulated resources over decades, and the deteriorating international environment has forced it to lose opportunities to develop foreign trade and obtain foreign resources. This situation was naturally brought about by Japan's expansion into the Asian continent, but the Japanese side puts the cart before the horse, and is even more reluctant to relax its attempts to control the Asian continent, in order to compensate for the economic blows and losses it has suffered in its foreign relations. However, economically, Japan's achievements on the continent should not be overestimated. Politically, its future fate on the continent is still an undecided mystery. Just like the Nazis, whose strength was unprecedentedly strong, immediately lost their effectiveness when they encountered the Soviet Union, which possessed a huge population, abundant resources, and unlimited manpower. The war results they quickly achieved in Poland, France, and Belgium may never be repeated on Soviet territory. Japan, whose strength is far from being comparable to Germany, faces China, which has a population as large as the Soviet Union. Whether Japan will succeed or fail is something that the Japanese military and political authorities cannot grasp. A year ago, Japanese "reformist elements" loudly advocated advancing south, using the rationale that China's resources were insufficient to meet Japan's needs. In reality, they were simply impatient with the failure to resolve the "China Incident" after four years of war. After once extravagantly discussing advancing south, their ambitions were divided, and their vision became chaotic, which was definitely not without impact on the progress of "resolving the China Incident." Since the establishment of the second Konoe cabinet, the Japanese side has been determined to carry out the construction of a "national defense state" and has been working hard, which is undeniable. However, at this time, it is precisely during a period of major consumption due to the war, and the source of materials has been severely blockaded. Even if they deliberately search and exhaust all resources, it is impossible to meet the standards of demand. For example, on the issue of shipbuilding, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese authorities have strictly maintained secrecy and no longer publish information, which has caused significant speculation from the outside world. However, if Japan, like the United States, had completed five 35,000-ton battleships in one year, perhaps it would have openly flaunted them to showcase its national power and use them to threaten Britain and the United States to make concessions during this period of precarious international situation? Japan's current situation is not only insufficient to compete with the well-equipped and well-trained Britain and the United States, but even compared with China, even if the strength of both sides has not yet reached equilibrium, the trends of rise and fall differ, and the situations are vastly different.

Japan's own situation is such that it is naturally insufficient to match the combined strength of the ABCD powers in the Far East. On the other hand, Japan is only facing a difficult situation and may encounter failure, but it has not yet encountered a major failure. Therefore, its saber-rattling momentum remains, and it is only willing to make local concessions at most, and does not allow a fundamental review of its expansionist attempts. The construction process of Japan's "national defense state" is based on this momentum. In reality, once war breaks out, how can Japan expect to be lucky? It has been widely rumored in recent days that the Japanese troops in Vietnam are prepared to take action against Thailand, and the Japanese side is also preparing to adopt coercive rhetoric regarding the safety of the Yunnan-Burma Road. However, how can the ABCD encirclement be broken through by attacking Thailand and Burma? Only great wisdom and courage can prevent a fall off a cliff. Those who are reckless and rely on brute force cannot achieve this. Japan's domestic and foreign policies over the past decade or so have been consistent, and reversing the accumulation of errors is difficult. Even if they suddenly change course, it would only be a matter of raising a hand or lifting a foot. Perhaps no one in the Japanese side dares to resolutely undertake this at this time.

Currently, the crisis in the Far East is as critical as a hairsbreadth, but the form in which the crisis will erupt cannot be predicted too early. In the current situation, Britain and the United States will naturally not immediately launch a military offensive against Japan, and Japan may not rashly attack Singapore or occupy Manila immediately. There is still a considerable distance between these possibilities. If Japan's reply to the US note is indeed firm and shows no signs of retreat, then turmoil in the Indochina peninsula will naturally be unavoidable, and its main target will still focus on "resolving the China Incident," because only after ending the war against China can it concentrate on dealing with Britain and the United States, and attacking China is also a way to attack Britain and the United States.

British Motorized Units Arrive on the Coast of Cyrenaica; Tank War Resumes in the Desert; General Levinstein Captured

Cairo, 30th (Havas): British Middle East Headquarters announced in a communique that British motorized units have reached the coast between Agedabia and Benghazi.

Cairo, 30th (Havas): British Middle East Headquarters announced that German Army General Levinstein has been captured on the Libyan front.

Cairo, 30th (Reuters): Another major tank battle is underway in the Libyan desert, having been in progress since Friday. The engagement is taking place about 20 miles southwest of Gambut. According to a British military spokesman, the battle is as fierce as before. On Friday morning, the German Zouk units, which had been dispersed throughout the desert, assembled, reinforced by an Italian division. When they advanced westward, British aircraft spotted them and immediately launched a fierce attack. Before long, British armored units moved forward to engage them. The battle continued throughout Friday night. The British army is constantly destroying enemy tanks within the Solun, Omar, and El Adem triangle, which it has surrounded. The number of casualties on both sides has not yet been officially reported here. Based on the current situation, neither side seems to be advancing or retreating. Yesterday, the German army seemed to be widening the gap south of Tobruk to allow its main forces to break through and make a general retreat. However, according to today's news, the British army is gradually closing the encirclement, and the battle is expected to develop more fiercely. Over the past 24 hours, the British army's lines of communication with the Tobruk garrison have gradually strengthened, which is a key point in the Libyan campaign. The fact that the British army captured an important stronghold north of Halfaya Pass yesterday shows that the corridor through which the British army will join forces from southeast of Tobruk to El Adem is gradually unfolding. Since the start of the Libyan offensive, Boeing fighter planes have shot down at least 46 enemy aircraft.

Dutch East Indies Celebrates British Prime Minister's Birthday with Tanks

Batavia, 30th (Reuters): Today, the Dutch East Indies celebrated the birthday of British Prime Minister Churchill with two heavy tanks, four light tanks, and two machine gun carriers. In its report to the British Prime Minister on the initial results of the Churchill tank movement, the Dutch East Indies stated that Churchill is a leader in upholding justice and freedom. British expatriates are currently holding meetings to celebrate, and American expatriates are also holding gatherings, using half of the funds they have collected to purchase Churchill tanks.

European War Anecdotes: Germany Two Years After the Start of the War

He also pays great attention to architecture. Every important building constructed in Germany must be approved by him. When the blueprints for the new opera house in Beirut were submitted for review, Hitler moved the refreshment area in the lounge to the basement. He explained, "I want to see well-dressed opera lovers there. It's not a place for sausages and stuffed bread!"

The power structure in Germany, like Hitler himself, has also changed, shifting from the party to the military. Today's Germany is under military dictatorship. Since the start of the war, the power of the party has gradually disappeared and is now almost completely gone.

Party members are gradually withdrawing from key national positions. The capable director of the propaganda department's news division, Karl Bomer, suddenly disappeared. It is said that "his downfall has been confirmed." Smaller leaders also feel the difficulty of their situation. The morning after Hess's defection was announced, the police arrested twenty truckloads of people in northern Berlin alone, including stormtroopers in uniform.

I have repeatedly heard that even during the economic panic and political chaos of 1932 and 1933, Germans were unwilling to accept military dictatorship. Therefore, the military and other reactionary elements had no choice but to support the National Socialist Party. Their approach was indeed correct, because since 1934, the revolutionary elements lurking within the party have been completely purged by Hitler. Today's high-ranking generals are all military men without political backgrounds. Many of them are intelligent, decorated with medals, skilled in etiquette, and only know how to obey Hitler. General Wilhelm Keitel, the director of the Supreme Command, is a typical example of these military men. His title and position are impressive, but in reality, it is Hitler who issues the instructions. General Walther von Branchtisch, the commander of the Army, is Keitel's liaison with the Army. Various military orders are transmitted from Hitler to Keitel, and then in turn to Branchtisch and the generals commanding troops on the front lines. The most outstanding generals on the front lines are probably Siegmund List and Krwin Rommel. List is a Bavarian with extensive knowledge and impeccable combat strategies. Rommel often surprises with unexpected moves during intense battles, causing Keitel and his ilk to pale in comparison. General Franz Halder, the Chief of the Army General Staff, is a first-class strategist whom Hitler relies on heavily when drafting detailed war plans.

Admiral Raeder, the commander-in-chief of the Navy, is like Keitel in the Army, always obedient to Hitler. Sometimes when Hitler orders him to engage with warships, he shows a look of love, because Raeder is a little reluctant to sacrifice a warship.

As for the Air Force, Hitler sets the general strategy, and Air Force Commander-in-Chief Göring decides the details. Göring cleverly gave the command of the Air Force to his extraordinary assistant, General Erhard Milch, who can be called the greatest flying general in the world. It is said that he is even of half-Jewish descent.

The officer class is delighted with the evolution of the situation. They are almost like heaven's chosen ones in Germany, controlling the mechanized construction system, surrounded by superior environments, exquisite ceremonies, and a good life.

Many ambitious young people have embraced the new glory of the German Army. If they come from the middle class, they should thank God. Hitler's Army is at least more democratic than the Army of Kaiser Wilhelm's era. One night in December 1940, my wife and I got lost in the blackout and were guided by a lower-ranking officer. He described himself as a poor young man. He also said that it used to be difficult for people without "family background" to get commissioned, but now during the war, as long as they can demonstrate leadership ability and excellent performance, it is not difficult to get commissioned. He said with great distress, "It is so frustrating to stay in Berlin and be with the air defense forces. It would be great if I could get to the front lines and show my skills." He drank the rest of his beer and said enthusiastically, "Our future is in the Army!"

Judging from various signs, Hess's flight to England was his own idea. Although he received help from others when he defected, it was clearly unknown to Hitler. His purpose in flying to England was to persuade England to make peace and unite with Germany to attack Russia.

Three days before Hess's flight to England, the German government had made a request to Soviet Russia to provide wheat, kerosene, and other materials in greater quantities and more rapidly. Hess, after Rosenberg, can be called one of the most vehemently anti-communist among the German leaders. He had discovered the danger ahead. If the Soviet government refused the German request, he feared that Germany would fall into a quagmire of prolonged war with the Soviet Union, just like Japan's entanglement in China. If the Soviet Union accepted the request, he also feared that the two countries would become increasingly close, and Germany would become tainted with Bolshevism.

Hess had always been pro-British. According to his confidants, he believed that it was unwise to fight against England and often wished for England and Germany to unite to form an anti-communist crusade to attack Russia. When German-Soviet relations were on the verge of collapse, he suddenly thought that if he could meet with British leaders and inform them of Germany's demands on Russia, it might make them understand. His argument was: if Soviet Russia accepted Germany's demands, Germany would launch a greater new offensive against England; if Soviet Russia refused the demands, leading to a long-term war, it might turn the entire Europe into red.

His miscalculation was due to his lack of knowledge about the world outside of Germany. He relied entirely on propaganda-tinted Nazi concepts, which were incompatible with reality. The destination he chose when flying to England is a prime example. He wanted to fly to the Duke of Hamilton's territory because he believed that the Duke must be influential in England. If the Duke and several other nobles could agree with his views, it would be easy to make the British government make peace with Germany. In fact, if Hess knew that the British hated and feared National Socialism even more than they hated and feared communism, he would have been speechless. If he knew that a duke was not necessarily a person in power, he would have been greatly disappointed.

The German newspapers' treatment of the Hess incident, saying that he had been insane for a year, seems to be a very clumsy tactic at first glance. However, after careful examination, it is known that this is a very intentional move. They actually want to use the Hess incident as an excuse to eliminate the power of the majority of radical factions within the party. (To be continued)

Bomb Explodes in German Barracks in Paris; Two German Soldiers Killed

Paris, 30th (Haitong News Agency): A bomb exploded in a German barracks in the 18th arrondissement of Paris yesterday, killing two German soldiers. All subway stations were immediately closed, and all streets were closed to traffic after 6 p.m. It is believed that the bomb was planted by terrorists.

Berlin, 30th (Reuters): German radio announced that the German commander in Paris warned the public that a curfew is in effect every night after 6 p.m., and violators will be shot on sight by patrolling German soldiers. In the area where the bombing occurred, the curfew will be enforced half an hour earlier. All entertainment venues will be closed, and all windows must be closed. Previously issued special curfew passes are temporarily invalid.

British Submarine Sinks Five German Ships in the Arctic Ocean; British Admiralty Announces Victory; German Troops in Murmansk Suffer Blow

London, 30th (Reuters): The British Admiralty announced last night that British submarines attacking the German maritime transport line to Murmansk in the Arctic Ocean have achieved another major victory. According to the communique, German troop transports and supply ships carrying troops and supplies to the German troops on the Murmansk front were severely attacked by British submarines in the Arctic Ocean, suffering heavy losses. The British submarine Tigris torpedoed and sank five enemy ships and damaged one. In one instance, the Tigris attacked three enemy supply ships escorted by multiple enemy warships, sinking two of them. Also, the British submarine Triton successfully attacked seven enemy transports and supply ships, sinking three of them and severely damaging the remaining four, which may also have been destroyed. The submarine also damaged an eighth enemy ship with artillery fire. Among the enemy ships sunk by the Triton, two were fully loaded with troops. Both British submarines had previously achieved numerous victories. The Tigris is a 109-ton patrol submarine, and the Triton was built just two weeks before the start of the war. It sank the first German ship in the Norwegian campaign during its maiden voyage.

Litvinov Arrives in Manila

Manila, 30th (United Press): The newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, arrived here today by plane from Singapore. President Quezon will host a banquet at 8 p.m. to welcome him. Litvinov stated that he did not bring any message to Washington except for himself. He declined to discuss the war situation.

Reports to Government Ministries and Commissions: Points for Attention Raised by the Political Participation Council (Continued from Yesterday)

Water Conservancy

Irrigation and drainage projects for farmland water conservancy are fundamental undertakings for alleviating rural poverty, involving investment cooperation between the financial sector and local governments. The central government should provide guidance on planning, strengthen administrative organizations, and provide ample funding. Water transport should be effectively coordinated with highways and postal transport to achieve effective cooperation between land and water transport. These are fundamental facilities for water conservancy and should be effectively planned and implemented in a comprehensive manner.

Society

The Ministry of Social Affairs has been proceeding with various matters related to the resolutions of the First National Congress of the PPC, and other plans and measures are also targeting actual needs and achieving considerable results. However, there are still several matters that require serious attention:

Regarding social administrative agencies, the government should urge provinces and counties with sufficient financial resources to establish social affairs departments and social affairs sections as early as possible, so that social work can be developed early. The cooperative business administration offices in each province should be placed under the jurisdiction of the social affairs departments to rationalize the system.

Regarding the organization and training of the people, the government should assist in the establishment of people's organizations and professional organizations, strengthen their organization, and also supervise their improvement and strengthen their control, so as to ensure both quality and quantity, and healthy development.

Regarding social welfare, although agricultural and industrial welfare undertakings have already begun, the scope is too narrow, and efforts should be made to expand them further. For relief undertakings managed by charitable organizations or private donations, if their strength is insufficient or their management is poor, the government should plan improvements. In particular, children's welfare undertakings should be provided with ample funding and unified educational standards. Social service centers in various places should be gradually promoted from important cities in the rear to war zones and border areas, and should focus on farmers, workers, and the poor and destitute as important targets for their services.

Regarding cooperative undertakings, the abnormal development of credit cooperatives in the past requires that more emphasis be placed on the promotion of production, marketing, and consumer cooperatives in the future, and they should be closely coordinated with professional organizations such as farmers and workers to achieve the actual effect of increasing production and stabilizing prices. A cooperative warehouse system should be established as soon as possible, so that cooperative organizations can fully exert their functions in wartime economy and local construction.

Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs

The report of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission on promoting the work of resistance and national reconstruction in Mongolia and Tibet is not without merit.

The Central and local authorities have been able to give considerable attention and effort. Other reports are also realistic, but slightly brief, making it difficult to see the actual plans and progress. The following points are specifically drawn to attention:

The case of organizing a Mongolian and Tibetan Comfort and Inspection Group has been resolved by the PPC twice, but has not yet been implemented. It should be given attention in the future.

Regarding the Tibetan work section, opportunities should be used in the future to vigorously promote active construction work.

Border survey work should be conducted with a purpose and plan in accordance with the needs of time and place, and should be geared towards practical measures.

Border culture urgently needs to be developed. Subsidies for students below specialized subjects and border cultural groups should be given serious attention, strengthened, and promoted.

Relief

The work of the Relief Committee has generally been carried out as required in wartime, and it has been able to distinguish between the urgency of wartime needs to accomplish its tasks. A few points are summarized to encourage attention:

The war zones across the country are vast, and the number of people previously sheltered is already insufficient. In the future, as the war continues, the people will be displaced as the war ebbs and flows, and the number of victims will inevitably be less than in the past. It seems that the original number of shelters should still be maintained, and the number should be increased appropriately to meet the needs. As for young and strong refugees, they should be strictly screened and restricted.

Refugee factories are unable to achieve self-sufficiency because of high food prices and increased costs. It is hoped that more funds will be allocated to each factory to enable business to be developed and production increased, and attention should be paid to the accommodation of rough labor and women, so as to promote relief.

Small loan funds are essential in wartime. However, the area is vast, and the planned establishment of 14 loan offices within the year is still insufficient to cover the distribution. More funds should be actively and massively raised, and branches should be set up throughout the area.

The education and care of refugee children should be promoted in a planned and systematic manner. Attention should be paid to clearly defining the scope and nature of subsidies, and to appropriate allocation to prevent abuses.

Health

The health report and all its facilities should be adapted to the needs of wartime. However, the points listed are too brief, making it difficult to make a detailed assessment of the progress of the work. Based on current factual needs, there are still several points that need to be seriously improved:

Promote the public health system, strengthen the organization of basic-level health care below the county level, and promote the establishment of more mobile clinics or health inspection teams to travel to rural towns and benefit the general public.

The number of health workers is insufficient. Active efforts should be made to train public health personnel and cultivate a large number of personnel to meet the current needs. Medical personnel should also be conscripted and properly allocated.

All levels of organization should strive for command and control. Management of personnel in medical institutions at all levels, in particular, should be carefully guided, supervised, and promoted. Highway health stations should be increased in number. Prevention and eradication of infectious diseases should be actively pursued.

The management office for narcotics and the factory for the repair and manufacture of sanitary equipment should be well-equipped. The wartime pharmaceutical supply committee should strive for improvement.

Health funding should be increased so that health work can be smoothly promoted. (29th Dispatch)

Far Eastern Situation Becomes Increasingly Tense; Japanese Ships on the Yangtze River All Cease Operations and Are Requisitioned by the Japanese to Transport Troops to Vietnam; Chinese Crew Members on the Tangshan Maru Dismissed

Four Dutch Ships May Be Requisitioned

As US-Japan negotiations continue intermittently, Japan has suddenly increased its troop presence in Vietnam, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense, leading to a daily increase in the number of Japanese merchant ships requisitioned by the Japanese government for military use. It was learned yesterday that the Xingchang Maru and Xingguo Maru of the "East Asia Shipping Company" in Shanghai have been requisitioned for military use following the Fengyang Maru and others. The two ships were originally Yangtze River liners and were intended to be rerouted to Ningbo. At present, out of the twelve Japanese ships on the Yangtze River route, ten have already been requisitioned for military use. In addition, the Tangshan Maru, with a deadweight of approximately 3,000 tons, was painted gray and sailed to Nagasaki, Japan, where all Chinese crew members were dismissed, and Japanese troops were loaded and transported to Vietnam.

Dutch East Indies Authorities Issue Requisition Order

The Chinese coastal routes have always been the center of foreign shipping power. The British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire hold the largest share of this power, followed by the Dutch Java China Japan Line (JCJL), which also occupies a portion, but in reality, it is still linked to the British and American sides. Since the outbreak of the European war, the British government has continuously requisitioned merchant ships for military use. It has been repeatedly reported that the ships of Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson in the Far East will be requisitioned. Therefore, the future trend of JCJL has attracted much attention, and the allocation of its ships has been of great concern. Currently, with the Pacific situation becoming increasingly tense and the uneasiness in Southeast Asia increasing, it is reported that the Dutch East Indies authorities have ordered the requisition of Dutch ships traveling between the Dutch East Indies and Shanghai. The JCJL freighter Tjilatjap (8,000 tons), scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in early December, has already been requisitioned. In the future, depending on the development of US-Japan relations, four other ships of the company may continue to be requisitioned. This matter has aroused attention from all sides.

Authority of Japanese Deputy Chief Inspector Expanded

According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, after the assassination attempt on Japanese Special Deputy Chief Inspector Akira Akagi of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department, the SMC and the Japanese Consulate General reached an agreement to reorganize the Police Department, abolish the title of Special Deputy Chief Inspector, and establish two Chief Deputy Chief Inspector positions to assist the Chief Inspector in handling all matters. In the past, the Japanese Special Deputy Chief Inspector only handled liaison with the Japanese side. The newly established Japanese Chief Deputy Chief Inspector will have expanded powers to assist the Chief Inspector and hold considerable authority. This position has been filled by Masaru Watari, who was recommended by the Japanese side, and was announced by the SMC yesterday (29th). As for Shigeki Goto, the new Deputy Chief Inspector of the Police Department, a Major in the Gendarmerie, he will hold the same authority as the Department Heads in the capacity of advisor to both the Criminal and Political Departments, assisting the two Department Heads in handling all matters.

Crackdown on Price-Gouging Shops Will Not Be Tolerated

The Mildest Punishment is Imprisonment and Fines; Coal Merchants Allowed to Apply for Foreign Exchange

The SMC will order all police stations within its jurisdiction to investigate shops that exceed price limits within the week. The SMC Price Control Office has printed a large number of red stickers, which will be posted on the doors of the shops that are investigated and suspended, explaining the reason for the order to suspend business and the duration of the suspension. The mildest punishment is a fine of 300 yuan or imprisonment for up to six months. In addition, the public is encouraged to report shops that exceed price limits. If customers discover this, they can submit the invoice to the SMC Price Control Office, but must indicate the name and address of the reporter to ensure credibility. Once the facts are verified, they will be punished according to law. According to a spokesperson for the SMC, "The SMC will never tolerate it. Since we have controlled prices, we must eliminate speculation and profiteering, so that all industries can be brought back on the right track."

Cooperation Begins to Stabilize the Coal Market

Following the suppression of rice prices, the two concession authorities have begun to plan concrete measures to stabilize the coal market and are now fully cooperating with the relevant fuel organizations, such as the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association, and the Coal and Charcoal Industry Joint Association. The above-mentioned organizations held separate meetings a few days ago to discuss ways to assist the authorities in stabilizing the coal market. The members of each organization all advocated ① clearing the sources of smoke-free white coal, ② assessing standard coal prices, and ③ thoroughly investigating inventories on a large scale and releasing them on schedule at limited prices. It is heard that the implementation of this will be suggested to the authorities.

Coal Merchants Can Now Apply for Foreign Exchange

The Price Stabilization Fund Committee is deeply concerned about the foreign exchange needs of legitimate merchants in Shanghai. In response to the request of the SMC delegation to Hong Kong, Li Deming, the Committee approved the monthly supply of US$1 million in foreign exchange to coal merchants for the sole purpose of purchasing coal. According to banking circles, the coal merchants can now apply for the approved foreign exchange. Since coal merchants can obtain legitimate foreign exchange, the cost of purchasing goods will naturally decrease.

Manufacturers Hoarding Goods Restrict Wholesale

Due to the sharp increase in coal prices and the instability of the international situation, many factories in Shanghai have suspended operations or reduced their scale, and the entire industry is in a state of turmoil. Now, the factories are gradually resuming operations, and their output is doubling compared to the past. There are three reasons for this: ① The factories' monthly coal needs have been agreed upon by the authorities and the Japanese side, and a large amount of coal is transported from the guerrilla areas to the two concessions for sale to factories. The selling price of this coal is lower than that purchased in the coal market. ② A steady stream of orders and telegrams from overseas Chinese is pouring in. Because England, the Soviet Union, and other countries are at war, the production of industrial products has decreased. At the same time, when converted to gold prices, the cost is higher. However, purchasing goods from domestic companies is calculated in national currency, and the cost is significantly lower. Once transported to the local area, high profits can be obtained. At the same time, overseas Chinese are patriotic and actively promote the export of domestic goods. ③ As winter approaches, residents need to purchase clothing, and the two authorities control prices and strive to bring the business community back on track. The factories are starting operations and shipping goods to increase the inventory in the market. However, the factories have placed many restrictions on the quantity of goods wholesaled to commercial firms, with the aim of preventing hoarding.

SMC Price Controls Omit Daily Necessities of Chinese People

Citizens Eagerly Hope for Early Resolution

Since the authorities in the two concessions have taken emergency measures to suppress prices in a swift and decisive manner, the general rice shops and coal ball merchants have all sold according to the authorities' price limits. The millions of citizens in Shanghai are praising the authorities. However, there are still a small number of retail stores, such as general merchandise stores and cigarette paper exchange shops, where the prices of daily necessities are uneven because many goods have not been included in the price limits. For example, the price of rough paper commonly used by residents ranges from 1.50 yuan to 1.20 yuan per ream. The market price of popular cigarettes such as Lao Dao Pai, Pin Hai Pai, and Wu Hua Pai is even more uncontrolled. Therefore, the general public is deeply dissatisfied with these retailers, but they cannot do anything about it because the authorities have not set price limits. According to the general public's opinion, they deeply hope that the authorities in the two concessions will quickly continue to announce price limits for daily necessities needed by the common people, such as rough paper, soap, and tea, so that retailers have no room to maneuver.

Industrial Association Distributes Rice for Free

Raised 650,000 Yuan to Relieve Civilians in the Suburbs

The Shanghai Industrial Association has resolved to purchase 5,000 dan of foreign rice at a cost of 650,000 yuan to relieve the poor. It plans to distribute cooked rice free of charge at these two locations in winter. The association has hundreds of member factories, and its office is located in Rooms 656-656A-606, Hamilton House. It is understood that the association has no connection with the Importers Association, but will cooperate with the SMC to promote the revival of Shanghai industry as its highest mission. It will use its power to oppose any bill that harms industry and commerce, and support all measures that benefit industry and commerce. The association is an international organization and has hired many well-known experts to form various advisory committees. The association's important plans will be announced from time to time.

American Red Cross Helps with Relief

200 Bags of Broken Wheat

Recently, the weather has been cold, and the number of poor people freezing to death on the streets is increasing, which is distressing. The Shanghai Three Religions Charity Association has started its winter relief efforts for a month, distributing more than 1,700 sets of clothing and more than 70,000 bowls of rice. The American Red Cross, in sympathy with the association's relief work,

Family and Housekeeping Discussion Meeting Yi

Not long ago, a newspaper reported that a certain prominent person's wife, in order to promote frugality and implement a new lifestyle, joined forces with like-minded women of high aspirations and organized a "Housekeeping Discussion Meeting." Members are required to strictly adhere to the creeds of "no gambling," "no smoking," and "no unnecessary socializing," and to practice frugality diligently.

This is indeed an admirable move. Gambling, smoking, and frequent unnecessary socializing disrupt household affairs, leave children without education, and husbands often run wild outside the home.

We sincerely hope that this "Housekeeping Discussion Meeting" will thoroughly discuss the shortcomings in Chinese families one by one and formulate improvement plans so that ordinary families can implement them accordingly.

Some people think that women discussing housekeeping is not the most important thing. However, if every housewife can manage a family in an orderly manner, not only will it be more stable and prosperous economically, but it can also influence husbands and children. Because when a husband can enjoy a wonderful family life at home, he will no longer want to waste time outside. And after a family's finances are very sufficient, the husband will not have to seek illicit income.

At the same time, children growing up in a perfect environment can develop excellent character and become useful talents.

In reality, whether a family is well-managed depends largely on the housewife's appropriate arrangements in housekeeping.

Seat Cushions and Table Runners Cui Fang

In a brightly lit room, seat cushions and table runners can be pure black. If pure black is too dark, then you might as well use dark blue.

Whether it is soft satin or poplin, both can be used as the material for making seat cushions and table runners. Soft satin is brighter, while poplin is more durable.

The patterns for making them are, first, the coiled dragon; second, maple leaves. The former is rich and magnificent, and the latter is classic and elegant. The former can be laid from autumn until the New Year, while the latter is the most appropriate decoration for the current season.

Embroidery Method: First, enlarge the pattern here and draw it on paper. Then, place a sheet of tracing paper underneath and spread it on the black satin, and trace the pattern onto the black satin. Next, stretch the black satin on a wooden frame used for embroidery. First, use gold thread to outline the contours of the coiled dragon or maple leaf, and then use golden yellow silk thread to fill in the empty spaces. If you don't use velvet thread, you can also use embroidery silk thread or floss.

Method of outlining the pattern with gold thread: Take two strands of surplus thread, place them side by side directly on the outline of the pattern, and use a small needle threaded with light yellow fine silk thread to sew the gold thread firmly onto the black satin at any time.

Method without using gold thread: This method is simpler. After completion, the pattern looks as if it were printed from an inked paper stencil.

### My Family Problem Essay Contest Announcement No. 9 A Gambling Mother Xiao Li

My father passed away nine years ago, and I have no brothers. Both of my older sisters are married. So, there are only my mother and me at home. I work in a private clinic, but the remuneration I receive is only enough for my personal expenses. The source of income is based on the meager property left by my father.

Logically, the two of us, mother and daughter, should be living in mutual dependence. However, unfortunately, the reality is not so. My mother is addicted to gambling, but I hate playing cards. My mother dislikes me reading in my spare time, but I must do it. Therefore, my mother and I are completely incompatible.

Every morning, after finishing the housework, I rush to the clinic. I eat lunch at the clinic, and in the evening, I return home with a tired body. As usual, my mother is at the mahjong table, the rice is in the rice bucket, and the vegetables bought in the morning are still in the basket. I don't need to worry about her lunch, as the restaurant at the entrance of the alley will provide it. Gambling like this, forgetting to eat and sleep, constantly losing. I really don't know how we will maintain our future lives if we run out of these meager assets. Occasionally, I would advise her a few words, but she would glare at me, enumerating how unfilial I am, and how unreasonable I am… constantly nagging.

Living this kind of life, my spirit has nowhere to rest. I hope to get married; I need the nourishment and comfort of love.

Now, there is someone I am interested in. He is a childhood classmate, and I am satisfied with everything about him, but he is a person who has an elderly mother and younger siblings who need to be supported. He does not meet my mother's conditions for a live-in son-in-law. This summer, he graduated from university, and he said that we should have a "concrete commitment." How should I answer this? Although I like him very much, I definitely do not want to alienate the feelings between him, his mother, and his siblings. On the one hand, my mother cannot do without me either. So, regarding this matter, I think I can only sacrifice myself.

I feel that there is no possibility of marriage. Even if I can meet someone suitable again in the future, they may not meet my mother's conditions. Even if it is possible, I am unwilling to let others suffer for me - at least, having such a grumpy, gambling, and pleasure-seeking person living together, the family will definitely not be harmonious and healthy. So, rather than having problems arise in the future, I would rather not take this step now.

However, the life and old age of an old maid are lonely and miserable enough. And what is even more serious is that when youth has passed and economic panic occurs, that is truly unimaginable.

This problem is intricately woven into a net, trapping me deeply inside, full of worries, depression, and unsolvable problems.

Editor's Note: The gambling habit of Chinese housewives can really be said to be a major loss to Chinese families. Like Ms. Xiao Li's mother, she has no affection for her own daughter because of gambling. Based solely on Ms. Xiao Li's description, it is difficult for us to make a definite judgment because family matters are the most complicated. Did this gambling mother like to gamble after marriage? The affection between mother and daughter certainly did not become incompatible in one day. And how do the two married sisters feel about this mother? Is it possible to persuade her to quit gambling?

In the situation that Ms. Xiao Li is in, direct dissuasion will definitely not work. It is necessary to move her with emotion, persuade her with methods, and use other hobbies that she loves to get her away from that gambling den. It really takes great patience, perseverance, and never give up.

As for the marriage problem, you can tell your current lover the real situation. For future lovers, you can continue to seek them. Conversely, enriching your own knowledge to lay the foundation for economic independence is also an urgent matter. Marriage is a major event related to lifelong happiness and is worth serious consideration. A woman who can achieve economic independence is also a commendable thing.

Preparation... Crab, Bird's Nest, Oil, Soy Sauce, Scallions, Ginger, Water Chestnut Flour

Method... Soak the bird's nest in cold water overnight. The next day, pick out the fine hairs, etc. Separately, take two or three crabs (not too big), boil them, and then take out the crab meat. Then, heat the oil in a wok. When the oil is hot, pour the bird's nest and crab roe together and stir-fry. Add some soy sauce, scallion pieces, and ginger pieces as you go. Before removing from the wok, add some water chestnut flour to thicken it. All the methods are the same as stir-frying shrimp crab roe, etc.

(149) Crab with Flour Coating Draft by Feng Dufu

Preparation... Flour, Crab, Scallions, Ginger, Soy Sauce, Oil

Method... After washing the crab, cut it into two halves and press it in dry flour. Then, fry it in oil until cooked. If you like to eat flour cakes, you must first mix the flour with cold water until thin and then thickly coat it around the crab. Then, put it in oil and fry it until it is cooked through. Wait until the flour outside the crab turns golden brown, then clamp it out. Separately, pour some water, add some soy sauce, etc., and briefly braise it. (When frying the oil, first put the scallion pieces into the hot oil and fry until charred. Sprinkle some salt as you go to make the oil emit a scallion flower fragrance. When mixing the flour, you may as well mix some ginger pieces, soy sauce essence, salt, and cooking wine into the flour and mix it together.) Eating crab with flour coating is more troublesome than eating other stir-fried crab roe, etc., because you have to peel the crab shell again.

Gentlemen… If you want to buy "MSG" and "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence," and , , 445941,

### Report on British and American Air Forces Planning Patrols of the Burma Road; American Volunteer Group to Undertake This Task, with Aircraft Support from Malaya and Burma

Chongqing – Military observers today, commenting on the programs reportedly under consideration in Washington, stated that "escorting" trucks on the Burma Road by the United States and Britain would be easy unless the Japanese could cut off the road. Once the Japanese launched an offensive from Vietnam towards the road, it was expected that they would concentrate their air power on the road in an attempt to cut off traffic or destroy war materials. Given Japan's current air superiority, this could be similar to Germany's concentrated submarine warfare against Britain's undefended Atlantic lifeline. Foreign military observers unanimously believe that patrols by British and American fighter planes would be sufficient as an "escort" against such attacks. This is precisely the true duty of Major General Chennault's American Volunteer Group. Its P-40 fighters and volunteer pilots could recently establish this system. If this force is insufficient to shoulder this arduous task, then fighter squadrons from the Philippines or the air forces of Malaya and Burma can be deployed to reinforce it, forming a fully capable "escort" program. Once Britain and the United States go to war with Japan, another important supply line may be opened. This issue has been under unofficial discussion for the past few weeks. This action would allow Chinese troops to, with British and American naval and air assistance, launch an offensive against Guangzhou, defeating the smaller, isolated Japanese garrison in Guangdong Province. Hong Kong, in this offensive, would become an important "cork," forcing the Guangzhou Japanese army into isolation and preventing its reinforcement. It is said that the recent arrival of Canadian troops in Hong Kong may be related to this, or it may be regarded as the ABCD forces' action of entering China to "escort" the Burma Road. Chongqing believes that this action should not be regarded as a genuine military action by the ABCD countries. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

Washington – A Reuters special correspondent reports that China will soon have its own "Flying Tigers" squadron to defend the vital lifeline of Chongqing and the Burma Road against Japanese attacks. While officials are keeping this plan strictly secret, some known facts suggest that this squadron will be entirely composed of volunteer pilots, but with the help of the US government. In recent months, many American aviators have resigned from their army and navy duties and traveled to China by ship. It is estimated that at least two hundred people will arrive in China in the near future. The Chinese side will undoubtedly experience great difficulty in obtaining foreign exchange to carry out this plan. The general public expects that Lend-Lease Act funds will be used. These American aviators will fly American fighters shipped to China under the Lend-Lease Act, mostly Tomahawk models. Their operational area will be approximately along the Burma Road and over Chongqing. Colonel Chennault will command these American aviators, his position will be similar to that of Colonel Sweeney when the British "Flying Tigers" squadron was first established.

### The China Society of Natural Sciences Holds Its 14th Annual Meeting in Chongqing; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues Instructions

Chongqing – The China Society of Natural Sciences held its 14th annual meeting in Chongqing on the 30th. Since its establishment in 1927, the Society has been highly valued by all parties. Its membership has reached over 1,400, making it a large-scale research institution in China. Branches have been established in major cities throughout the country. Since the outbreak of the war, branches in the occupied areas have ceased operations. There are three overseas branches, in England, Europe, and the United States. This year's annual meeting was held at the Chongqing University Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 30th. Chairman Hu Huanyong presided over the meeting, with over one hundred members in attendance. Minister of Education Chen and Acting President Zhu of the Academia Sinica both attended and delivered speeches. Zhu believed that governing natural sciences should focus on on-the-spot investigation and research, while also aiming to promote the development of applied science. Chen first elaborated on the relationship between applied science and pure theoretical science, arguing that the development of applied science can promote the progress of pure theoretical science, and the development of pure theoretical science can also promote the progress of applied science. Chen then broadly discussed the Book of Changes and the teachings of the Six Arts in ancient China, proving that China has been engaged in the research of natural sciences for a very long time. Finally, he encouraged the members of the Society to work hard in the study of natural sciences with perseverance and enthusiasm. Subsequently, the heads of various departments of the Society reported on the Society's affairs. The meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, the general assembly continued to discuss the Society's affairs, read papers, and hold thematic discussions. The theme was "Promoting Scientific Education Programs." (Reported on the 30th)

Chongqing – The China Society of Natural Sciences convened its 14th annual meeting in Chongqing on the 20th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially issued instructions, saying, "To Chairman Hu and all members of the China Society of Natural Sciences: At this important period of resistance and national reconstruction, it is most gratifying that your Society is holding its annual meeting in the wartime capital to serve the country with academic research. Our country, with its backward science and weak national defense, has been fighting a strong neighbor for over four years, sacrificing heroically. We, in recalling Sun Yat-sen's instructions to catch up, further realize the importance of saving the country through science. Overcoming the enemy and achieving victory certainly lies in the development of science, and the great cause of national reconstruction in the future depends even more on the contributions of scientists in many aspects. The so-called national reconstruction must establish a secure national defense, and even more so establish the nation's independent scholarship. In recent years, thanks to the consistent advocacy of the government and society, an increasing number of students have enthusiastically participated in various departments of applied science. This is certainly a good phenomenon, but everything has its foundation, especially in scholarship. If theoretical science does not have a solid foundation, then applied science cannot make real progress. Your Society takes exploring scholarship as its mission, and should pay special attention to promoting this point, so that China's scientific education does not suffer from the drawbacks of achieving quick success due to temporary urgent needs. The construction of western China has always been relatively backward. Since the start of the war of resistance, the southwestern provinces have become the center of the country's politics, economy, and culture. Most of the members of your Society are gathered in the southwest, and you have also organized a Northwest Science Expedition to conduct on-the-spot exploration, in order to enrich the data for scientific research in the west. With the special convenience of working in the west today, I hope you will follow your original intentions and work even harder to promote the construction of the west through in-depth research. In this way, the strengthening of the foundation for resistance and national reconstruction, and the benefit to the great cause of national reconstruction, will be immeasurable. I express my views to encourage you all." Chiang Kai-shek, Seal of Respect and Care. (Reported on the 30th)
