### British Air Force Takes Action: Fierce Bombing of Syrian Airfields; Preemptive Strike to Curb German Troops Pouring into Iraq; Vichy's Permitting of German Passage Worsens Anglo-French Relations

Cairo – Imperial troops of the Middle East Command yesterday reassessed An伦, a key strategic town on the Egyptian-Libyan border, and strengthened their defenses against Axis forces. Simultaneously, the British Air Force fiercely bombed German aircraft based at airfields in Syria. It is reported that the Central Aircraft Command's attack on Syria was ordered by London because French authorities had violated the terms of their armistice agreement with Nazi Germany by allowing German aircraft to be stationed in Syria, enabling them to attack Iraq. (Associated Press, 16th)

London – It was learned last night that British bombers are currently fiercely attacking new German air force bases in Syria. Because the French authorities in Syria have granted the German Air Force every convenience, the area has been declared enemy territory by the British. British warplanes have launched an offensive to prevent the area from becoming a corridor for German forces to attack Iraq and the Suez Canal. It is noted that this is the first time since the start of the war that British planes have appeared in Syrian airspace. According to official sources, at least German troop transport planes have landed at three bases in Syria. It is also claimed that Nazi plainclothes personnel have reportedly been allowed to enter Iraq with the tacit approval of the French. It is known that at least thirty German aircraft, disguised as French planes, have already departed from Syria for combat. It is widely expected that once the British Cabinet authorizes the British Air Force to carry out "acts of war" against Syria, British ground forces will invade Syria. Britain has already revoked its recognition of France's right to govern Syria, as France...

Cairo – Official sources announced that after Ali Gailani issued an urgent appeal, several German aircraft, war propagandists, and other Axis technicians have flown to Iraq. It is reported that these German planes were not carrying troops, but only technicians and civilian personnel to Iraq. Responsible parties estimate that about thirty German aircraft have flown over Syria; the planes bear no German markings, and it is believed that they are painted with French insignia. Private sources here report that several German aircraft have already landed at the 赖迦克 air base in Syria. One report states that military missions from both Axis powers arrived in Baghdad via Syrian airspace a few days ago. The Italian mission included two Italian Air Force generals and several staff officers. The German mission consisted of fifteen people, arriving in two planes. (Reuters, 16th)

London – According to reliable sources in London, Britain has notified the French government that it will attack any German aircraft at airfields in Syria. Furthermore, Baghdad Radio reported that the Soviet government has permitted Soviet pilots to volunteer for service in Iraq to avenge Britain's assistance to Finland. (Associated Press, 16th)

London – Amid an increasingly tense atmosphere, it was reported tonight that British and Imperial reinforcements have arrived in Iraq and 巴力勘坦. London does not consider it unusual that several German bombers have flown from Syria to Iraq. It is reported that British consular personnel will remain stationed in Syria. According to widespread rumors in Ankara, a squadron of German bombers, at least seventeen in number, escorted by fighter planes, flew over Syria and landed in Mosul, Iraq. Another report states that ten German aircraft are currently departing from the莱雅克 airfield in Syria. According to a Cairo dispatch from the Free French News Agency, German tanks and light combat equipment have crossed from Syria into Iraq. The dispatch also stated that Free French pilots dropped leaflets on Thursday evening signed by General贾德鲁, the current Free French representative in the Middle East, who formerly served as the governor of Damascus and is very familiar with the situation in Syria. 贾德鲁 also broadcast to the French in Syria, urging them to break away from the Vichy government controlled by the Germans. According to sources in the Near East, none of the Arab leaders are inclined to assist Rashid Ali and continue to be loyal to the British government beyond any doubt. (Reuters, 16th)

Cairo – According to sources in Syria, German forces have continuously infiltrated Syria. A group of German bombers has also arrived in Syria from Greece and the Italian-held Dodecanese Islands (i.e., the杜得坎尼斯群島). (Associated Press, 16th)

British Forces Recapture Sollum

Cairo – British military headquarters announced that, as a result of operations protected by British forces on Thursday, the British army captured Haifaya,摩賽 and 倫 respectively, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and capturing many German soldiers. Although heavy rain continued to fall in the Abyssinian area, British forces continued to advance towards Amba Alagi. The important stronghold of 史西亞斯希瑪曼那 in the southern region has been occupied by British forces, and further captures continue. (Associated Press, 16th)

German-Turkish Negotiations Underway

London – Major military developments in the Middle East are expected today. It is believed that Hitler will work to obtain Turkey's agreement to allow Germany to transport military supplies without transporting troops through Turkey, similar to the agreement originally made with Yugoslavia before the coup. Foreign diplomats believe that the German ambassador to Turkey, 巴本, is currently conducting negotiations to allow German heavy mechanized equipment to pass through the 士麥拿 to 阿勒, iron road. Military experts estimate that 500 German troop transport aircraft, each making one trip, could transport a division from Greece or the Aegean Sea to Syria. This deployment of troops will include rifles, machine guns, and perhaps small tanks. (Associated Press, 16th)

### U.S. Government Reapproves Transport of Machine Parts to the Soviet Union

Washington – It was announced yesterday that the United States has reapproved the transport of machine parts to the Soviet Union. Secretary of State Hull met with Soviet Ambassador乌曼斯基 on Wednesday, enabling乌氏 to continue discussing US-Soviet commercial issues with Undersecretary of State威爾士. The items approved for shipment to the Soviet Union this time are textile and shoe-making machinery. (Associated Press, 16th)

Washington – A spokesperson denied reports that the U.S. government had already issued export licenses allowing machines worth one million dollars to be shipped to the Soviet Union, emphatically stating that 米 has never issued any export licenses. (Havas, 15th)

### British Foreign Secretary Reports on Near East Situation in House of Commons; France Allows Germany to Use Syria; Mandate Status Recognized as No Longer Existent

London – British Foreign Secretary Eden stated last night in the House of Commons that Britain would take action against German aircraft in Syria. Based on detailed information obtained by the British government, the French authorities are now allowing German aircraft to use Syrian airfields, so the British government has issued orders to deal with German aircraft. The French government cannot evade responsibility for this situation because, under German orders, it has allowed German aircraft to fly into Syrian territory, clearly violating the armistice terms and contradicting the assurances given by the French government. Labor MP威爾問 asked whether Britain could still trust the Vichy government. Eden replied that he had stated that in such special circumstances, appropriate action would be taken. Another Labor MP, 考克期, asked whether it was not a fact that since the Vichy government had withdrawn from the League of Nations, France's mandate over Syria no longer existed. Eden replied that he wanted to consider it further before replying, but that the argument had considerable force. Liberal Party瓊期 asked whether 　國 had warned the Vichy government. Eden replied that the Vichy government was well aware of Britain's attitude in this matter, and that Vichy's own assurances were a full expression of its obligations. Eden also replied to a question from a certain议昌,調 that the US government had been informed of the details of this development. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent 調, after Eden announced that German aircraft had arrived at Syrian airfields and that the British government had allowed General华維爾 the freedom to deal with this situation, that since Vichy had accepted the conditions proposed by the German side for improving the understanding of French preparations, the key point of international politics had suddenly shifted to Syria. This is a serious development in an already complex situation, and its impact on Anglo-French relations cannot be easily predicted. From a purely legal point of view, France's rights in Syria were based on the mandate granted by the League of Nations. Since France had announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations, this right had already terminated, since according to the League of Nations Charter, no non-member state could enjoy a mandate. Therefore, the actions taken by Britain, in theory, were not against a mandatory power. It is currently查 that there are still French garrison troops in Syria, estimated to number between 30,000 and 60,000, mostly colonial troops. As for French soldiers, most of them were transferred back to France when the French government collapsed last June. The troops currently stationed in Syria are not elite French forces and often clash with local residents. Strikes and disturbances have recently occurred frequently in Damascus and Beirut, and the authorities have had to make concessions to avoid inciting major changes. Since the establishment of the 葵士林式 government in Iraq, there have been sympathizers between Damascus and Beirut. However, generally speaking, the general public in Syria has no animosity towards Britain. Although Syria does not have many well-equipped airfields, the plateau where Damascus is located has many places that can serve as landing grounds for aircraft and are also conducive to mechanized warfare.

### German Aircraft Active in the Mediterranean; Crete and Malta Heavily Bombed

### Nazi Diplomatic Activities Wooing Turkey for Cooperation; Willing to Maintain Friendship and Increase Trade; Turkish President Receives Iraqi Minister of the Army and Greek Envoy

Turkish Capital – It is generally believed that when German Ambassador to Turkey巴本 visited the Turkish President yesterday, in addition to presenting Hitler's "friendly letter," he particularly emphasized Germany's goodwill towards Turkey. It is reported that 巴本 made this statement at the Turkish Foreign Ministry on Wednesday. It is rumored that 巴本 made no demands on Turkey, but only emphasized the friendly relations between Germany and Turkey, as Germany and Turkey were allies during the last war. He also told the Turkish people that Germany was willing to engage in larger-scale trade with Turkey. It is widely expected that Turkish President伊斯美, following normal diplomatic procedures, will instruct the Turkish ambassador to express his gratitude for Hitler's letter. However, 巴本 must also understand that the Turkish people are not swayed by sweet words and adhere to false security agreements, as Turkey is currently continuing to take all necessary measures, such as expelling fifth column elements and 発份子, to safeguard its independence. (Reuters, 16th)

London – A correspondent for the Free French News Agency stationed in 期丹埠 claims that Germany has now increased assurances to Turkey, stating that if Turkey can provide Germany with economic facilities, it will definitely not involve it in the vortex of war.

London – Turkish capital Radio stated that Turkish President伊斯美 met with the Iraqi Minister of the Army and the Iraqi Ambassador to Turkey yesterday afternoon and received the Greek envoy at the Presidential Palace. (Reuters, 16th)

### Sino-US Stabilization Agreement Operating Smoothly

### China Will Import Military Supplies via India

Hong Kong – US military supplies and aid to China will in the future pass through India. In ancient times, China's communication with the outside world depended on the comings and goings of merchants, and India was also a must-pass for merchant caravans. Several Chinese experts and technicians are currently going to the Sino-Indian border to survey everything. It is said that during the Han Dynasty in China, Buddhism was introduced through these camel routes. During the Tang Dynasty, three monks were sent to India via the camel route to study Buddhism. According to an order from the Chongqing government, no matter what difficulties are encountered, the ancient camel route must be reopened. (International News Service, 16th)

Editorial

### The Holding of Sino-American Trade Week

The American community in Shanghai will hold Sino-American Trade Week starting tomorrow, with great programs planned, truly a major event. Tracing back the establishment of Sino-American trade and formal diplomatic relations, it dates back to 1844 in the Western calendar, nearly a century ago. The actual trade between the two countries, using Macau as the port of entry and exit, was even earlier, before the Opium War. At that time, the Qing government was weak and the country was declining. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, its weaknesses were fully exposed. European countries often used local cases involving Christian converts as pretexts for coercion, making insatiable demands, seizing key ports, and taking inches to gain feet. It was more than just opening the door; there was almost no door left to speak of. Furthermore, they separately defined so-called spheres of influence to maintain control and monopolize, resorting to the insidious plot of dividing and occupying, and the overall situation was precarious, with the disaster of collapse imminent. Only the United States acted differently, not only not participating in such aggressive groups, but also reversing the tide, issuing a declaration of the Open Door Policy in China, this was in 1899, and the great disaster was thus averted. By 1905, due to the harsh American policy of prohibiting Chinese labor, a boycott movement arose in the southeastern provinces, which eventually subsided because the United States had no ambition for Chinese territory, and relations soon recovered. Since then, for more than thirty years, the Chinese people have only known the United States as a friend of China, with absolutely no dissent. Although the two countries have no specific and special political alliance, private friendships and cultural exchanges have a special character. Even in trade, despite frequent setbacks from war and obstruction by force, it still firmly holds the top spot in China's trade, as it has always been. Truly because the US government and the public can be selfless and not be willing to compromise, and never be swayed by threats and inducements regarding what China is experiencing. Never considering the possibility of compromise, and always showing its just and impartial attitude, maintaining its determination to uphold democracy. Gifting sympathy to China, encouraging it in spirit in many ways, and providing material aid in many ways. In today's world, this is truly unique. All of the above is clear evidence of the seamless friendship and sincere mutual trust between the two countries. Imagining this, the friendship between China and the United States will inevitably advance and not retreat, increase and not decrease, and will always be the two great democratic bastions on both sides of the Pacific.

The key to coexistence between two countries is co-existence. The key to trade between two countries is mutual benefit. Bartering what one has for what one lacks, supplying what is needed, trading and retreating, and each getting what they want; this is the norm, this is the right path. If it is with force as a vanguard, with politics to expand authority, no matter what is touted as economic co-prosperity, the signs are obvious, the intentions are clear, how can this completely conceal the hearts and eyes of the people of the world. Granted that the end result is still economic, but impoverishing its people and seizing its profits, that what they advocate the Open Door and Equal Opportunity, at the time already freed China from the calamity of division, and in the dozens of years thereafter, the objective interests given to China for another question, but measured by the meaning of coexistence and mutual benefit, it is indeed in line with it, and is what the Chinese people will never forget. Furthermore, we have more expectations for the United States. Although the United States continues to send sympathy to China and maintain its independence, the action is slow, and it always feels that the urgency cannot be relied upon. We also know that this is not what the US, as a dominant nation, deliberately wants to do. A country has its own position, and its own public sentiment, and cannot be recklessly disregardful of other countries and rush into action. But since the United States wants to make China a member of the Eastern democratic front. Before it was inconvenient to provide clear and substantial assistance, in the future, the United States should know that the various ways of assisting China before have not been quite right. Those who threaten China often think that what the United States can help China with is like this and nothing more, thus arousing their contempt. China believes that the United States wants to help me, to make me work hard for the democratic front, wanting to make its feet sink deeper and deeper into the mud, not only from the quantitative aspect there should be a large amount of assistance, but also from the temporal aspect, agile actions must be taken, otherwise, the Chinese people often feel that the kindness of the United States is indeed touching, but sometimes it is affectionate but not affectionate!

However, the Chinese people should know that self-help leads to help from others. Do not think that because the Americans can help me, and neglect their own due responsibilities. The one who helps China is the United States, who knows that there are those who help them? Are there not those who hinder in the middle? Then the future difficulties may be even greater than the present. How should the Chinese people invigorate their spirit to resist this adverse environment, struggling from extreme hardship to the path of light, not allowing the dust to disturb their Qi, and their depressed to hinder their ambition. A lotus in the fire, is that what it is? It is said that those who gain the Tao gain much help, and those who lose the Tao gain little help. Now the United States is showing its rich and great human and material resources, continuing the extinct and preserving the surviving, supporting the endangered and helping the distressed. It can be seen that the help is given in a rightful way, and the effect of the help is great. It can be seen that within a short number of years, the sea and the world will be clear, and democracy will triumph. The Sino-US diplomatic relations, a hundred years of eternal friendship. The trade between the two countries, is progressing without end. It is still hoped that this Sino-American Trade Week will further promote it in many ways.

### Japanese Troops in Central Hubei Repeatedly Suffered Heavy Blows; Chinese Army Recovers Original Territory; No Trace of Japanese in the Dahongshan Area; Fujianese Chinese Army Recaptures Lianjiang City Yesterday

Washington – This place does not attach importance to the Tokyo-transmitted saying that the Japanese army has recently won great victories in Jin Province and several other places in China. For the past three years, the Japanese side has repeatedly transmitted news of great victories of the Japanese army in Pu, but it has ultimately turned into a bubble. It is generally believed that the actions of the Japanese army in Jin, Zhejiang, and other places in China are aimed at harassing the Chinese army's self-defense actions, but the Chinese army is still disrupting Japanese transportation routes. (Reuters, 16th)

Chongqing – According to official sources, after the front-line units of the Chinese army broke through the Japanese army's offensive in Yingshan, Sui County, Zhongxiang, Jingshan, Jingmen, and other areas, they controlled the combat areas in various parts of Hubei today. The Japanese army units, which had launched an offensive for ten days without success, suffered more than 10,000 casualties. The remnants of the Japanese army were purged in the 十洪山 area in central Hubei. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army used many columns, and the offensive that began on May 5 in central Hubei has been defeated by the resistance of the Chinese army. At the same time, the Chinese army and the Japanese army in the area west of Yuanqu in southern Jin are still deadlocked, fighting to the death. Chinese newspapers say that there are fierce battles now in the area bordering Jin and Yu on the north bank of the Yellow River. The Japanese army is eager to attack the Chinese army in Zhongtiao Mountain, and at the same time wants to occupy various crossing points in order to cut off the communication between the Chinese army positions on the south bank of the Yellow River and Zhongtiao Mountain. Chinese newspapers say that the war is now taking place on four battlefronts, namely, the Jin-Yu border, northern Hubei, Zhejiang, and Guangdong. The battle on the north bank of the Yellow Sea is the most fierce, but in the east and north of Guangzhou, Japanese troops are also facing fierce resistance. The Japanese army had occupied Boluo and Huizhou in Guangdong Province, and there are still scattered battles south of Zhuji in Zhejiang Province. (Associated Press, 16th)

### Many Japanese Aircraft Attacked Chongqing Yesterday; Chinese Anti-Aircraft Artillery Units Fiercely Counterattacked; Japanese Aircraft Fled After Dropping Bombs

Chongqing – Three batches of 63 Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing in the morning of the 16th, and the Chinese Air Force's "anti-aircraft units" fiercely counterattacked them. The Japanese aircraft fled after dropping more than 200 bombs at high altitude. (16th telegram)

There were several casualties in the western suburbs and along the avenue leading to the Yangtze River. Although several bombs fell in the lower city near the Jialing River, most of the bombs fell in the western suburbs. (Reuters, 16th)

Chongqing – Fifty-four Japanese bombers this morning dropped heavy bombs and incendiary bombs on two vast areas of Chongqing. Qualified observers say this was the most serious air raid this year. A large fire broke out in the city, but by dusk, the fire had been extinguished. The newly built suburbs to the west were also bombed, but the damage seemed minor. An entire street of wooden houses near the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers was burned to ashes in 50 minutes. Of the civilians, 2,000 (mostly boatmen) have been rendered homeless by the fire. Chongqing Ice Company's first factory was also destroyed by fire. According to company owner斯華爾, the estimated loss is 150,000 yuan. Several bombs also landed in the courtyard of the foreign press apartments where most foreign news agencies are located, causing much of the plaster on the houses to be shaken off, and several doors were blown away. The total number of casualties is estimated to be no less than 300. Six bombs directly 　 hit the Chongqing ice plant, causing a fire. Factory全斯華爾 personally extinguished the fire, saying, "The matter has come to this, what's the use of regretting it? I will go to the bank this afternoon to withdraw my deposit, and start rebuilding my ice plant tomorrow." 斯氏 is an American businessman who has lived in Chongqing for 19 years. Last year, his residence was destroyed by Japanese bombs, and his ice plant was also damaged. Although he had filed a request with the government, he had not yet received compensation. (Associated Press, 16th)

### Civilian Calmness in Bombed Luoyang

Luoyang: Due to impending actions by the Japanese army, women, children, and non-essential government officials in Luoyang have begun to evacuate. Although Luoyang has been under air raids all day for the past week, civilians remain very calm. Occasionally, when the air raids pause for a few hours, the rumble of artillery vehicles from the northern front line can be heard clearly. The Japanese army has completely occupied important crossings on the north bank of the Yellow River. The train station is crowded with civilians evacuating on orders from Chongqing. This morning, a special express train bound for Si'an was bombed, damaging one of its carriages, but it is not yet clear if there were any casualties. Train services may be interrupted at any time. The authorities have prepared all available rickshaws, handcarts, and horse-drawn carriages to facilitate the evacuation of civilians. This has caused minor problems, as there is a lack of transportation for food in the countryside. The Italian Catholic Church in Luoyang, despite having clear markings, was also bombed on May 11th. It has been confirmed today that the Japanese army, which recently seized crossings on the Yellow River, has retreated north from the Yellow River. It is unknown whether the Japanese army plans to concentrate its forces at one crossing or is heading to counter the Chinese army attacking its rear from the Zhongtiao Mountains in Shanxi Province. Some Japanese army units are being supplied with food dropped by airplanes. Villages and towns on the south bank of the Yellow River have organized special anti-paratrooper units to prepare for the Japanese army's use of paratroopers in combat. It is reported that the Chinese side has also established a paratrooper alert system that is distinct from the usual air raid alerts. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

### Johnson Hosts Press in Hong Kong; Gauss Arrives Today; Johnson Returns to U.S. After Meeting Gauss; U.S. Air Force Commander in the Philippines Also Arrives

Hong Kong: U.S. Ambassador Johnson arrived here yesterday afternoon. Today, he hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at the U.S. Consulate. Johnson was as approachable and amiable as ever. The ambassador said, "I have been in China for thirty-three years. It is hard to leave. China is my second home. I was married here, my daughters were born here. I have made many friends in China, including many close friends. My heart always feels the abundance of friendship and always cherishes my ideal," etc. In answering inquiries, Johnson said, "China has the wise leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, whom I admire most. Under Chiang's leadership, China will surely prosper and become strong after the war." Johnson continued, "Before going to Australia to take up my post, I will first return to Washington to meet with my family. The new U.S. Ambassador to China, Gauss, will arrive in Hong Kong on the 17th. Johnson will leave Hong Kong on the 21st by flying clipper after meeting with Gauss." Johnson also said that Gauss is the most suitable successor as Ambassador to China, as they have worked together for more than ten years and entered the diplomatic service at the same time, and Gauss is very familiar with the situation in China. Various sectors of the Chinese community in Hong Kong are scheduled to host a banquet for Johnson on the 19th. (Dispatch of the 15th)

### U.S. Fails to Win Over France; Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Countries Nearing Severance; Ambassador to France to be Recalled Soon

Washington: In practical terms, diplomatic relations between the United States and France appear to have been severed. It is expected here that U.S. Ambassador to Vichy, Admiral Leahy, will soon be recalled. The U.S. effort to prevent France from joining the Axis powers has largely failed. Today's main topic of discussion is the fate of the French territories in the South Pacific, which the United States is naturally concerned about. (Reuters, 16th)

Washington: President Roosevelt yesterday strongly condemned French-German cooperation. The President issued an official statement saying, "It is incomprehensible why the French people would accept an agreement to cooperate with Germany, as this agreement will align them with nations that seek to destroy freedom throughout the world." President Roosevelt, after consulting with Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary of State Welles, said that the U.S. policy towards France is based on the previous French-German armistice terms. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

U.S. Attaches Great Importance to French-German Cooperation

Washington: Diplomatic sources here believe that President Roosevelt's strong condemnation of French-German cooperation is an appeal to the French people to resist their leaders' direct cooperation with Nazi Germany. These sources also believe that the President's statement is a warning that the United States recognizes any Axis establishment on the coast of French West Africa as a serious threat to the Western Hemisphere. President Roosevelt said in an official statement that it was unexpected that the French people would agree to France's cooperation with Germany. It should be noted that this cooperation actually unites them with a country that seeks to destroy freedom and democracy everywhere. Recalling that two weeks ago, President Roosevelt said that the U.S. fleet might go to any place the United States deems necessary to protect the Western Hemisphere. In addition, there is a faction in the military here that has long held the view that the United States should occupy the westernmost part of Africa to prevent the Axis powers from seizing it as a base to attack the main routes from the Western Hemisphere to Europe. Unofficial sources said that the most concerning thing here is that French-German cooperation includes French colonial regions. Pro-British people do not believe that this cooperation can reach a decision, but they believe that it complicates Britain's defense problems, especially if the Germans enter French North Africa and Syria. If Germany reaches these places, it will be easy to attack Gibraltar and the Suez Canal. People here originally thought that President Roosevelt's statement was a friendly appeal to the French people, but because of the strong tone used by President Roosevelt, these people believe that if French-German cooperation becomes a reality, the United States may no longer use verbal warnings, but may resort to actual actions. The order from the U.S. Treasury Department for armed guards to board ten French ships and the luxury liner *Normandie* in U.S. ports came just minutes before the White House issued a statement. It is believed that the Treasury Department's action is a warning to show that the United States is determined to morally and materially resist any action that harms U.S. interests. It is said that the Treasury Department took this action after receiving news that French-German cooperation would include military activities. Officials have hinted that the United States may take further action today, and it is believed that U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy may be recalled. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

### Pétain Delivers Speech; Endorses Full French-German Cooperation; Calls on Nation to Obey His Leadership

Vichy: Marshal Pétain recently delivered a radio address here, calling on the people of the whole country to advance under his leadership towards the path of glory and national interest. He said, "As you all know, Vice-Premier Admiral Darlan recently met with Führer Hitler in Germany. As a result of the talks, I have, in principle, expressed my approval and will continue negotiations with the German government. The press has expressed unease due to a lack of information, but at this time there is no time to consider success or failure, weigh the risks, and criticize our actions. All of our countrymen should advance under my leadership towards the path of glory and national interest and must not harbor ulterior motives. If we can use the national spirit of strict discipline to bring the current negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion, then France can reverse its defeat and maintain its position in the world. In short, France is still one of the European powers and possesses colonies. That is all I want to say to you." (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Vichy: What specific steps the government will take based on the results of the recent French-German talks are expected to be officially announced in a short period of time. Vice-Premier Darlan will have to return to Paris in the next few days to continue talks with the German authorities. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Rumor German Reduces Territorial Demands

Vichy: Observers here believe that Hitler must have obtained Mussolini's agreement to reduce Italy's territorial demands on France in exchange for France's cooperation with the Axis. Marshal Pétain's short broadcast last night has indeed turned France eastward. From now on, France's entire political, economic, and colonial policy will be in line with the Axis powers' plan to build a new order in Europe and Africa. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

### The Mystery of Hess's Escape to England; British Minister of Labour Expresses Views; Must Be Wary of Nazi Tricks

London: Prime Minister Churchill did not make a statement in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the outcome of the conversation between Special Envoy Kirkpatrick and Nazi Deputy Führer Hess. A Member of Parliament asked why the British authorities did not release the news of Hess's arrival in England earlier, resulting in the German side broadcasting Hess's mental derangement first. The Prime Minister replied that since Hess's mental derangement had been clarified, the timing of the information release was irrelevant. Liberal Party Granville asked the Prime Minister whether he could declare the correct news to the House of Commons as soon as he had the opportunity. Churchill replied, "Of course, but in choosing this opportunity, public interest must be the premise." Many Members of Parliament asked why the government delayed the release of the news of Hess's arrival in England. Churchill said that the delay was necessary because, first, it must be determined whether the person was indeed Hess. The initial information came suddenly, and its nature was very surprising. The authorities found it very interesting but could not immediately believe its truth. On Sunday, when he heard this news, he could not believe it was true, so he immediately sent someone who knew Hess and could speak fluent German to meet with him. At that time, the German side had already issued a notice that Hess had gone to Scotland. In this situation, the intelligence service had created the impression in Germany that Scotland was preparing to make a separate peace with Germany. (The audience laughed.) Minister of Labour Bevin said in a speech in London yesterday, "In my personal opinion, Hess is a murderer. I have this feeling about Hess because Hess compiled a list of the leaders of German trade unions and social democrats, and when the time was right, those on the list would either be sent to concentration camps or assassinated. I cannot believe that Hitler did not know about Hess's coming to England beforehand. I have dealt with these totalitarians and communists for many years, and I have seen enough of these tricks. I will not be deceived by them. Hess is not someone I want to talk to."

The plane Hess was on will be displayed in Trafalgar Square during London's War Exhibition Week for people to see. (Reuters, 16th)

Details of Talks Reported to London

London: Important documents related to Hess's escape from Germany are said to have been brought to London this morning by Kirkpatrick, Director of the Foreign Office of the British Intelligence Department. Mr. Kirkpatrick arrived on a fighter plane flown by the Duke of Hamilton. The truth about Hess's bizarre departure may be revealed by this development. Mr. Kirkpatrick carried a briefcase containing some documents and arrived at London Airport last night with the Duke of Hamilton. It is reported that Mr. Kirkpatrick and the Duke of Hamilton went to Prime Minister Churchill to consult immediately after arriving here. Afterwards, the Duke of Hamilton met with the Minister of Intelligence. It is said that the Duke will write a commentary for the public. Hess is now being held in a heavily guarded hospital in Scotland. Kirkpatrick has met with him for four days, and the Duke of Hamilton has also often spoken with Hess since Hess landed on the Duke of Hamilton's estate. (International News Agency, 16th)

### U.S. Senate Passes Bill to Requisition Foreign Ships; Isolationists Believe This is No Different From an Act of War

Washington: The Senate yesterday passed a bill authorizing Roosevelt to requisition 84 foreign ships staying in U.S. seaports, with a vote of 59 to 20. These ships include the French ship *Normandie*, 28 Italian ships, and 2 German ships. The ships of Germany and Italy had previously been detained by the U.S. Coast Guard for sabotage activities in the United States. During the final stage of the Senate debate yesterday, Democratic Senator Lee of Oklahoma urged the President to declare a state of war emergency and "use the most effective means to use the air and naval forces to defend the Western Hemisphere." The bill has now been sent to the House of Representatives for review of the Senate amendments. Michigan Republican Senator Vandenberg tried to prevent this from happening, but was defeated. He finally said that if the United States gives Axis ships to Britain, it is "no different from an act of war." Georgia Democratic Senator George, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the United States now needs ships, "no different from the urgency of the United States going to war with the Axis." Vandenberg's and Missouri Democratic Senator Clark's amendments were defeated by a vote of 43 to 38. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

### U.S. Naval Security Force Guards French Ship

Oakland: The Naval Security Force boarded the French cargo ship *Alerte* yesterday and guarded it for 24 hours to prevent sabotage. If the bill to requisition foreign ships becomes law, the ship will also be requisitioned by the U.S. government. (International News Agency, 16th)

### German Ambassador to Japan Meets with Matsuoka Separately; Talks are Routine; British Newspaper Analyzes Japanese-German Relations

Tokyo: Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin met with Foreign Minister Matsuoka at 3:00 p.m. today for a 20-minute discussion. It is reported that various issues between the Soviet Union and Japan were discussed, but the details are unknown. German economic envoy Walter also met with the Foreign Minister and talked for a long time. Prime Minister Konoe met with the Emperor at 3:20 p.m. today and reported on general government affairs. Konoe answered the Emperor's questions and then had a cordial talk with the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal on various state affairs. He left the palace at 5:00 p.m. (Reuters, 16th)

Tokyo: This morning, a government spokesman insisted that the recent visits of the British and American ambassadors to Foreign Minister Matsuoka were merely routine matters. He also said that Matsuoka would also meet with German Ambassador Ott and discuss routine matters. The spokesman said that the British and American ambassadors visited the Foreign Minister within an hour on Wednesday, not by prior arrangement, but merely a coincidence. The spokesman concluded that the Foreign Minister and Japanese Ambassador to Nanjing Honda were in complete agreement on the China issue and were willing to give the Chinese greater economic freedom. As for whether this move would result in freer trade with third countries, it would depend on future developments. (Reuters, 16th)

London: An editorial in the *Manchester Guardian* said that Japan, which is so desperately trying to achieve peace, has a difficult life. Japan claims to be maintaining peace in the Pacific and has concluded the Berlin Tripartite Pact. If the United States joins the war, Japan and the Axis powers will attack it together. Although the alliance did not mention the Soviet Union, the measures against the United States also apply to the Soviet Union. Japan is eyeing the Dutch East Indies covetously and has decided to first secure peace with the Soviet Union. Thus, a new treaty was concluded, in which Japan and the Soviet Union stated that if either party is attacked by a third party, the other party will remain neutral. This seems to be dealing with Germany, but Germany does not care, because at this time Germany's only view is that Japan should clash with Britain and the United States as soon as possible. However, Japan has now received news and knows that Germany and the Soviet Union will soon conclude a larger agreement stipulating that the Soviet Union will supply goods to Germany, and Germany will allow the Soviet Union a free hand in Asia. The ink is not yet dry, how can one find a free hand? Japanese soldiers have never trusted the Soviet Union, so their organ newspaper, *Kokumin Shimbun*, was shocked by this news and said that if the Soviet Union regains its freedom of action in the East, Japan cannot sit idly by. Thus, Japan is now hesitating and wondering whether its new and old allies are dealing with Japan. In short, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan only trust each other superficially. (Reuters, 16th)

### *Ta Kung Pao* Receives Missouri Medal; Congratulations From All Sides; China Press Association Celebrates with Tea Party

Chongqing: British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr sent a letter of congratulations to Chang Chi-luan, editor of the *Ta Kung Pao*, saying, "The award is well deserved. I wish you a bright future and hope that you will work hard to uphold democracy at a time when it is under serious threat throughout the world." (Dispatch of the 11th)

Chongqing: Dong Xian-guang, Wu Dao, Zhao Min-heng, In Ying-bin, Zhong De-chen, Ma Xing-ye, and others, Chinese students who studied at the Missouri School of Journalism, hosted a lunch on the 15th for colleagues of the *Ta Kung Pao* to congratulate them. Xiao Tong-zi, Shi Zhong, and others from the Chinese and American press were also invited to accompany them. (Dispatch of the 15th)

Chongqing: At the joint celebration tea party held by the China Press Association and the Chongqing Press Association to celebrate the *Ta Kung Pao*'s award, two telegrams were unanimously passed and sent as follows:

(1) Congratulatory message to Mr. Martin, Dean of the School of Journalism, University of Missouri, USA: "We are pleased that your university has awarded this year's Medal of Honor to our colleagues at the *Ta Kung Pao*. The China Press Association and colleagues from the Chongqing press are deeply honored. We held a meeting today to celebrate and decided to express our gratitude and congratulations to your university. Your university has made great contributions to building journalism education, cultivating talent, promoting journalistic ethics, and enhancing international goodwill. We have long admired you. The Chinese graduates of your university have made great contributions to our country and society. Their spirit of service is a model for journalists. We hope that the faculty and students of your university will continue to lead journalists around the world to cooperate bravely and uphold the victory of freedom and justice. Chinese journalists are willing to do their part. Xiao Tong-zi, Chairman of the China Press Association; Chen Bo-sheng, Director-General of the Chongqing Press Association, respectfully." (2) Message of condolence to struggling colleagues in Shanghai: "To our colleagues in the Shanghai press, via the Central News Agency: The University of Missouri School of Journalism in the United States has awarded the 1941 Medal of Honor to the *Ta Kung Pao*. The China Press Association and colleagues from the Chongqing press believe that this is a common honor for the Chinese press. We held a tea party in Chongqing today to celebrate. According to Zhang Chi-zhang, editor-in-chief of the *Ta Kung Pao*, who attended the meeting, Chinese journalists love their country, uphold justice, and do their duty with joy, not fearing sacrifice. Since the war began, they have been able to represent the traditional spirit of Chinese journalists and display moral glory to the world. Those in Shanghai are the most outstanding. The *Ta Kung Pao* has not been able to do anything special since it resumed publication in Tianjin and Shanghai after its suspension and in its ordinary service at home and abroad. Although it is now accepting the Missouri Medal, it wishes to declare that this honor should be bestowed on the martyrs who sacrificed for justice in Shanghai and other occupied areas and on the colleagues in Shanghai who are currently continuing to fight for justice. Our meeting participants praised Mr. Zhang's opinion and made a temporary motion to stand in silence to pay tribute to the martyrs who have died in the war in various places. We send our condolences to the families of Mr. Zhu Xing-gong, Mr. Zhang Si-xu, Mr. Cheng Zhen-zhang, Mr. Shao Xu-bai, Mr. Jin Hua-ting, and Mr. Wen Tian-sheng, and to our colleagues in the Shanghai press, expressing our admiration and mutual encouragement. The scale of China's press industry is small, but its ethical standards have never lagged behind. Now that international journalism circles are gradually increasing their understanding of the Chinese press as our national prestige increases, and as national affairs become difficult and world events become dramatic, we hope that all our colleagues will be more loyal, brave, and strive to fulfill their duties, and at the same time work hard to cooperate closely with world journalists who uphold justice in order to realize the success of our national defense and strive for the victory of human freedom. Colleagues in Chongqing are willing to encourage each other with colleagues in Shanghai. The China Press Association and the Chongqing Press Association." (Dispatch of the 15th)

Shanghai Press Circles Express Efforts

Local report: The China Press Association and the Chongqing Press Association held a celebration at the Central Party Headquarters Auditorium in the capital the other day to celebrate the *Ta Kung Pao*'s award of the Medal of the American Missouri School of Journalism. As suggested by the *Ta Kung Pao*, this honor was attributed to the martyrs who sacrificed for justice in Shanghai and other occupied areas and to the colleagues in Shanghai who are currently continuing to fight for justice. The organization sent a telegram of condolence to struggling colleagues in Shanghai. After receiving the telegram, colleagues in the Shanghai press immediately sent a telegram to the China Press Association and the Chongqing Press Association, expressing their gratitude and extending warm respects to the *Ta Kung Pao*. The original telegram is recorded as follows:

"The China Press Association and the Chongqing Press Association respectfully read the telegram. The *Ta Kung Pao*'s award of the Medal of the American Missouri School of Journalism enhances the reputation of the Chinese press. All of us are happy and admire it. Our colleagues are stranded in Shanghai and were unable to attend the celebration, but we are grateful to the *Ta Kung Pao* and your association for your kindness in sharing the beauty with others, attributing the honor to the martyrs who died for our profession and including our colleagues in Shanghai. We believe that the martyrs who died for righteousness deserve to be praised for their uprightness, which is the glory of the press. As for our colleagues, we have been doing our best in our positions for the past four years. Although the environment is becoming increasingly difficult, we ask ourselves what duties we should fulfill as citizens. We are grateful for your praise and are increasingly ashamed. We will continue to pursue our original aspirations in the future, strengthen ourselves even more, cooperate closely with those who uphold justice, maintain this spiritual fortress in southeastern China for our country, and strive for the victory of human freedom. We sincerely wish the *Ta Kung Pao* and our colleagues across the country a new era in their international status, and express our sincere respect for the efforts and struggles of the *Ta Kung Pao* and all our colleagues. At the same time, we express our deep gratitude to the families of Mr. Zhu Xing-gong, Mr. Zhang Si-xu, Mr. Cheng Zhen-zhang, Mr. Shao Xu-bai, Mr. Jin Hua-ting, and Mr. Wen Tian-sheng on behalf of the Shanghai press. The Shanghai press." (16th)

### Electricity Supply Restriction Issue: Temporary Measures Maintained; Committee Recommends Temporary Suspension, To Be Implemented Only During Extreme Fuel Shortages; Original Plan Involved Dividing Users into Eight Categories Based on Percentage of Reduction

The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) has released the report of the Special Committee on "Electricity Supply Restrictions" and, based on the recommendations in the report, has decided to temporarily suspend implementation. The SMC previously invited Dr. Li Zhennan, Mr. Mays, and Mr. Toyokawa Ryonosuke to form a special committee to study the issue of equitable distribution. The committee has now completed its study and prepared a report. The report has been reviewed by the SMC's Public Utilities Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.

Suspension of Recommendations

To avoid disrupting industry due to changes in electricity distribution and to await clarification of the current uncertain fuel supply situation, the SMC has also approved another recommendation from the Shanghai Power Company to temporarily suspend the implementation of the committee's recommendations until the fuel supply is severely impacted as currently anticipated, or when fuel reserves drop to 100,000 tons. The company currently has 120,000 tons of coal in stock.

Users Can Appeal

The current temporary electricity conservation measures will remain in effect. The SMC has invited the above three committee members to review appeals regarding the report's recommendations. These appeals should be submitted to the Shanghai Power Company, which will forward them to the committee for review. The committee's decisions will be sent directly to the appellants. It is hoped that the committee's decisions will be acceptable to appellants as final rulings in the vast majority of cases. However, given that taxpayers have the right to appeal to the SMC on important matters, any taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the committee's decision may file a further appeal to the SMC. These further appeals should be sent to Mr. J. W. Allan, Deputy Secretary-General of the SMC. The SMC will issue a separate public notice on the 17th of this month, specifically detailing the previous report.

Method for Determining Percentage Reductions

The SMC's Electricity Supply Restriction Committee report is quite lengthy. The most important part is Section 7, "User Classification." The report explains the reasons for the electricity reduction. Section 7 states that the percentage reductions applied to the maximum electricity consumption of each user category have been determined to ensure that total electricity consumption is around 31,450,000 kilowatt-hours per month, or 25,000 tons of fuel. The details are as follows:

Category 1

Maintaining public order and essential services. This category includes hospitals, street lights, defense forces, communications, police, and fire departments, drainage, and waterworks. These services are essential to society, so no specific restrictions are proposed. However, they should be asked to find ways to reduce consumption voluntarily. Last year, the maximum monthly electricity consumption for these users was 2,499,428 kilowatt-hours, while the average monthly consumption was 1,906,064 kilowatt-hours. This shows a reduction of 24%.

Category 2

Hygiene and food. This category includes the manufacture and storage of food, as well as the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. It also includes the manufacture of gas and coal briquettes. Coal briquettes are now widely used by the public as a substitute for firewood for cooking, so they can be classified as food. It is proposed to reduce electricity consumption for this category by 40%. Electricity consumption for this category has already been reduced by 45%. Therefore, the actual reduction is already higher than the proposed reduction.

Category 3

Public transportation and utilities. It is proposed to reduce electricity consumption for this category by 30%, which should not cause significant difficulties.

Category 4

Buildings. This category is very broad, including large residences, offices, apartments, and hotels. The committee believes that a 50% reduction in maximum electricity consumption would be fair. In addition, some schools and university buildings will also be included in this category. Reducing their maximum electricity consumption in the summer should not be a problem. However, priority should be given to buildings using electricity to pump water from artesian wells.

Category 5

Industry. This category is the largest, including cotton mills, various metal factories, paper mills, chemical and rubber factories, and those using electricity to manufacture products. Electricity consumption accounts for 73% of total electricity. The committee originally intended to divide this category into two or three subcategories based on the number of employees and the sales of products in and out of the city, to differentiate them. However, in order to reduce fuel consumption to 25,000 tons, there is no other way than to recommend a drastic reduction for all users in this category. All attempts to classify various industries have failed. Reluctantly, the maximum electricity consumption will be reduced by 70%.

Category 6

Luxury goods. This category includes brewing, tobacco, confectionery, cosmetics, wireless equipment, photography, and barbershops and beauty salons. It is proposed to reduce their electricity consumption by 75%.

Category 7

Billboards and bright lights. Neon lights consume very little electricity, and other advertising lights account for only a small portion of the total. However, completely eliminating this type of electricity consumption can have a psychological effect. This is especially true when other industries feel the loss due to electricity conservation. As the committee has already clarified above, no user should deprive the safety department of electricity supply. Therefore, according to this principle, appropriate allocation should be considered, but it is proposed to reduce their electricity consumption by 75%.

Category 8

Entertainment venues. This category includes cinemas, theaters, and dance halls. Similar to Category 7, their electricity consumption will be reduced by 75%.

British Residents Donate Old Newspapers

Exceeding 20,000 Yuan

Entirely Donated to the British War Fund

The "Old Newspaper Collection" organized by the British Residents Association of this city has been very effective. From last October to the end of April this year, old newspapers were sold for a total of 22,473.36 yuan. All of the proceeds were donated to the British War Fund Committee. According to a responsible person from the British Residents Association, the amount of old newspapers collected is increasing every month. It is estimated that sales will reach 50,000 yuan by the end of June this year to support the war fund. There are branch offices in various districts of the city, such as the Central District of the Settlement, the French Concession, West Shanghai, and Hongkou. Mr. Evans, a member of the association, made a broadcast on XCDN radio last night to promote the old newspaper collection movement.

### Port Rice Continuously Unloaded, Retail Sales Start This Morning; American, Soviet, and Thai Ships Compete to Transport Rice from the Far East, Shanghai-Rangoon Freight Rates Plunge by Sixty Shillings

According to official announcements yesterday, port rice will be sold starting this morning by more than 300 rice shops in the two settlements. Starting Monday (July 9th), the number of rice shops selling rice will increase to more than 800. It is also said that all rice shops in the city have requested to sell the rice, but due to time constraints, not all of the rice can be delivered to the market. The public believes that as the plum rain season approaches, speculators will be forced to release their stockpiles of rice, so rice prices must fall sharply.

Expediting Pickup on Weekends

Yesterday, more than 400 rice merchants in the two settlement areas paid and received delivery orders at Jardine Matheson & Co. In addition, there are more than 400 others who will complete the procedures within the next two days. In the afternoon, some rice shops were seen hanging white signs with black characters in front of their stores after taking delivery from the Roosevelt Warehouse and the Taikoo Warehouse. The signs read: "This store sells SMC foreign rice, today's market price is 110 yuan per picul." Rice merchants have only three days to pay for the rice. Today is the last day. However, because there are too many merchants placing orders, it may not be possible to complete the process within the three-day limit. It may be possible to extend the deadline. Yesterday, Mr. Meyler of Jardine Matheson & Co. announced to the public that the office will be open as usual on Saturday afternoon and Sunday without holidays. All rice merchants who have not paid for the rice can go there within the next two days.

Second Batch of Port Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai

The Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship, carrying SMC port rice, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Because the ship had sailed from Shanghai to Hong Kong earlier and someone had died on board after the ship had cast off from the Bund wharf, the Jianghai Customs Bureau, upon receiving the report, instructed the ship to temporarily stop at the Pujiang buoy when it arrived in Shanghai this time. Doctors and customs officials were dispatched to board the ship for inspection yesterday morning. Only after receiving a doctor's certificate was it allowed to proceed to the Bund wharf in the French Concession. It carried 10,042 bags of foreign rice, which will be unloaded and stored in warehouses starting today. In addition to the Guangdong ship, the Ewo Company's Fushun and Yushun ships, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai tonight and today respectively, are also carrying SMC rice.

Shipping Costs Plummet, Reducing Costs

Yesterday, rice prices in the city continued to fall by 4-5 yuan. Saigon No. 1 rice fell from 123 yuan to 119 yuan per picul. Compared with the market price on the 20th of last month, it has fallen by 46 yuan. The main reason is that the SMC is selling low-priced foreign rice. Another reason is that after the United States, the Soviet Union, and Thailand increased the number of ships sailing from the Far East, shipping companies have now reduced the freight rate for the Shanghai-Rangoon line from 220 shillings per ton to 160 shillings per ton. As a result, the freight cost of Rangoon rice per ton has plummeted from 90 yuan to 50 yuan. The cost of rice has been greatly reduced, and rice prices have fallen sharply.

First Batch of Government Rice Arrives in Shanghai Today

The French Concession Municipal Council ordered 200,000 bags of low-priced Saigon No. 2 rice. The first batch of 31,500 bags will arrive today on the Norwegian ship Vareune, managed by the Andersen Meyer & Co. As for the second batch of 20,000 bags, it will arrive on the Sarraut ship managed by the Chinese-French Company on the 20th of this month. In the future, it will be decided to ship more rice to Shanghai. According to a responsible person from the French Concession Municipal Council yesterday, the council will formally negotiate and decide on the selling price of the rice immediately. The selling price will be lower than the selling price of Rangoon Special Xiao Grain sold by the Public Concession, and it will be sold widely.

### Shanghai-Nanjing Train Detonated by Mine

According to someone from Suzhou yesterday, the Shanghai-Nanjing railway train, which departed from Shanghai North Station at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, was suddenly detonated by a landmine near Wangting. There was a loud explosion that reverberated far and wide. At the time, the train was bombed and severely damaged. A large number of passengers were killed and injured. After the incident, the Japanese learned of it and immediately sent a team of Japanese soldiers to conduct a thorough search near the scene. Finding no clues, they tried to tow the damaged vehicles for repairs. The Japanese also took care of the injured and dead passengers.

### Yiji Charity Association Sells Plain Rice at Low Prices, Raising One Million Yuan

The Yiji Charity Association held a board meeting yesterday, attended by Huang Jinrong, Fan Huichun, Fan Tai, Wen Lanting, etc., chaired by Huang Yanfang. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that the existing rice reserves of 10,000 bags would be used to sell plain rice at six locations at low prices. Since more than 3,000 bags are needed each month, the remaining rice can only last for three months. It was decided to continue selling plain rice at low prices for another six months and to raise one million yuan from all sectors of society to purchase rice.

### Shanghai Volunteer Corps Adds Second Company, Czech Nationals Enthusiastically Participate

Recently, young Czech nationals in this city have enthusiastically joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps as volunteer members. It is understood that the "A" Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has seen a decline in the number of members due to the return of British nationals to their home country to enlist. The company is responsible for the defense of the central district of the Public Concession, a heavy responsibility. Therefore, the Volunteer Corps Headquarters has decided to establish two Czech companies within the "A" Company. A total of 31 newly joined Czech nationals in the "A" Company and 30 newly joined Czech nationals in the "B" Company have undergone strict military training. They have officially been incorporated into the "A" Company yesterday.

### Shanghai Animal Protection Society Relocates

The Shanghai Animal Protection Society has been doing outstanding work in animal protection over the years, earning the sympathy and support of enthusiastic individuals from China and abroad. The society has now relocated to 285 Zhao Bishop Road due to the development of its services and the inadequacy of the original location. If you have any inquiries, please contact the new address directly or call 79482.

### Public Buses and Trams to Increase Fares Again Next Month; Water and Gas Rumored to Also Increase Fees

According to reliable sources, trams and public buses in the Public Concession will increase fares starting on June 1st, by approximately 15%. The Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council approved the fare increase requests from the two companies at a meeting on the 15th and submitted them to the Council. The Council will study this at its next regular meeting and then formally approve it. It may also approve fare increases from the water and gas companies. However, a spokesman for the Municipal Council refused to make any formal statements about the Public Utilities Committee meeting yesterday. He neither confirmed nor denied that the Committee had approved the fare increases.

### Crackdown on Car Horns, Reduce Horn Volume; Week Starting the Day After Tomorrow is Crackdown Campaign Week

The Public Concession Police Department has stipulated that from the 19th to the 26th of this month will be Car Horn Crackdown Campaign Week. Mr. Fick, Head of the Transportation Department, wrote to car owners yesterday, "Dear Sir/Madam, regarding the Car Horn Crackdown Campaign Week, I sincerely hope that you will give the Police Department your enthusiastic assistance. If car owners can instruct their drivers to only use the horn when absolutely necessary and to minimize its use, and if owners/drivers can use caution, then the

nuisance of

horn sounds can be greatly reduced. As for the drivers of other vehicles, other methods should be used to remind them of the importance of horn sound nuisance. Therefore, if owners and owner-drivers can provide adequate assistance, the annoying horn sound will be minimized. In order to assist in the success of this campaign week, the police authorities' request for your enthusiastic cooperation will surely be strongly supported." The following three points should be noted by drivers: (1) Never use the horn unnecessarily. (2) A short, concise sound is sufficient. (3) If your horn is too loud, please go to any of the following car dealers to reduce the volume at no cost: Auto Palace, Reiff Maling, Dah Hwa, China Motors, Yunfei, Fulin, Fadah, Xiang Sheng, Jiangnan Industrial Company, Datong, Marty, Long Island Trading, Xintong, Lishi, Tanle, Ford, Hezhong, Yangzi, various car dealers.

### Wu Zhongyi Issues Statement: I Deny Participating in Party and Government Work

On the 15th of this month, the Japanese newspaper Shanghai Mainichi Shinbun carried a news item about the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League, which involved Mr. Wu Zhongyi, former editor-in-chief of the Great American Newspaper. The gist was that the Shanghai branch of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League had recently resumed activities, with a committee organized by school principals and teachers as the central organization for assassinations and propaganda. Wu Zhongyi, through the China-America Daily, acted as a mouthpiece, and so on. Someone visited Mr. Wu to ask if he had seen this news. Mr. Wu replied that he had not. Then, he was shown the newspaper. After reading it, Mr. Wu smiled and said, "This is truly absurd. I have no relationship with the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League, let alone acting as a mouthpiece for the League through the China-America Daily. As you know, I have lived in Shanghai for many years and am purely a freelancer. I have never held any party or government position. All the statements in the newspaper are completely fictitious."

### New Commander of US Naval Task Force Inspects Subordinates This Morning; Ceremony to be Held at the Racecourse at 9:00 AM

Another 1,000 tons of foreign rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council, totaling 10,042 bags, arrived yesterday morning on the Swire Company's Guangdong ship, which docked at the company's wharf on The Bund in the French Concession to unload. (Zu)

Yesterday, foreign rice suffered a severe drop in the market, with both futures and spot prices seeing reductions of 4-5-6 yuan, and the situation was weak, with the downward trend seemingly not yet over. Compared to the high prices of the previous month, the low prices of yesterday had fallen by as much as 40 to 45 yuan. Assuming the city has 2 million bags of rice in storage, the wealth loss must be above 90 million yuan. Some households that hoarded rice have not yet lost money, while those low-ability new hoarders who were overjoyed at the sight of profit have mostly suffered the consequences. A fleeting cloud, one cannot help but sigh. It is said that if it falls another 10 to 20 yuan, it will force one industry (related to rice, not just rice merchants) to cry while the whole city laughs. However, we do not want them to cry, but we hope that they take this as a warning, awaken as soon as possible, and no longer hoard for speculation to harm people, then the future is long, and there may be opportunities to benefit society. After the foreign rice market opened in the morning, the market sentiment was already uneasy due to the previous day's weakness, and it was heard that water transport fees had been reduced by a quarter, or 30%.

The total day's trading volume was 6,000 bags of spot rice and 6-700 tons of original bags, so it is estimated that it is about 40 yuan lower than the highest price.

Domestic rice such as Hougeng was still sluggish in the local shops, and arrivals were not strong. Prices were similar to before, with Hougeng only opening at 134-5 yuan for Keng from Kunshan in the big market, and early and late rice from Nangang still opening high at 134 yuan, followed by 132 yuan, and original bags at 137-8 yuan.

The wheat market is even quieter, because Dumo's supply and demand has long been silent, and various mills have also stopped buying long ago, it is heard that the current high Dumo selling price is at 45-6 yuan, which is also quietly loosening by 1-2 yuan compared to before.

### Preparations

— Xiao Yun

It is said that before the German army set out for North Africa, they actively carried out a series of preparations. Accustomed to fighting in the tropics, they built greenhouses, where the temperature was constantly maintained above 100 degrees, for the purpose of training soldiers. All the troops who were to be sent to North Africa had to be trained in the greenhouse.

London firefighters also underwent a similar "ordeal" during training. They had to wear gas masks and practice firefighting in rooms filled with poisonous gas.

This European war is related to the life and death of both Britain and Germany, so everyone is taking out real skills, and no one dares to slack off. Their preparations are both serious and thorough.

Life is like war, why don't we need to prepare? Students prepare for exams, and everyone has to do their best to enrich themselves and prepare to meet future difficulties.

As for unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate, although what they do is also preparation, it is not worth learning from.

### The Runaway Concubine

— Sun Jieren

In a chance encounter, I met my third aunt, my uncle's third concubine, whom I hadn't seen for two years (she ran away two years ago). We looked at each other in surprise. At first, she seemed to want to avoid me, but then she came up to me and greeted me:

"Long time no see, Jieren! How are you?"

"Fine, thank you for your concern, Third Aunt!" Seeing her so frank and generous, I couldn't help but step forward and chat with her.

"Aunt? Please don't call me that anymore! Two years ago, I was indeed a concubine of your uncle, but now I am my own person. I can no longer accept that title!" She said sternly, making me immediately change my words and say:

"Then Ms. Liu!" I remembered that her surname was Liu, so I called her that.

"Hmm! That's good," she nodded and said. "You're probably hoping to know everything about me over the years and the reason why I left, right?

"That's exactly what I wanted to know, I would be very grateful."

"Alright! I'll tell you some of it since I have nothing to do. Let you also know what kind of person your uncle is and what my struggle has been like." She adjusted her hair, sighed deeply, and began to tell her story:

"It was four years ago. At that time, I was still a naive girl who had just graduated from elementary school in the countryside and was planning to continue my studies. Suddenly, something unfortunate happened! My father died of a sudden illness, and then my mother fell ill due to excessive grief. My family was not rich to begin with, and my father's death and my mother's illness made the family impoverished, so much so that we could hardly maintain our daily lives! Being in such a situation, as a weak and incompetent woman, what else could I do besides crying bitterly? Alas! Thinking back to that desperate situation, it still makes me infinitely sad!" Saying this, she paused, her eyes flashing with memories and sadness. I held my breath and listened in silence. After a while, she continued:

"Coincidentally, your uncle sent a matchmaker to propose marriage, so I married your uncle as a concubine. At first, my mother and I were reluctant, but the matchmaker's words were so sweet and so pleasing to the ear. He said that your uncle's family had no one except a crazy wife, and that your uncle was well-behaved, honest, only in his thirties, rich, and had a good position... Although I felt that most of the matchmaker's words were unreliable, for the sake of my mother's life and medical expenses, I finally resolutely stepped into your uncle's house, selling my own happiness to fulfill my filial piety. Can't this be said to be a great sacrifice!" Saying this, she paused again, and I still listened in silence.

"After entering the house, everything was indeed different from what the matchmaker said. In addition to your aunt, there was also your second aunt, that woman who was bought from the brothel. Your aunt wasn't crazy either. As for your uncle, not only was he in his forties, but he was also cunning and obscene. The business he did was all unjust, and the money he earned was all ill-gotten, scraped from the common people. At that time, I was so disappointed and regretted that I wanted to commit suicide, but I finally woke up and turned passivity into activity. I made up my mind, and that intention was the motivation for my departure two years later! At that time, I saved money while looking for a girls' school to continue my studies. In those two years, I suffered all kinds of hardships and endured ridicule and scorn, but I finally managed to learn many skills and knowledge in a very difficult environment. When I realized that I had the ability to be self-reliant, I felt that I had truly stood up. I had finally stood up! Just imagine how happy I was at that time!" Saying this, she became spirited and a victorious smile appeared on her face.

"I immediately got a job, so I rescued myself from the pit of fire! Although I lost my virginity, I finally won future happiness! Your uncle could not do anything to me for my departure, because since my knowledge had increased, I had learned many secrets about his business. He was afraid that I would expose his secrets, so he could only let me go like this. He had even admitted defeat at my hands! In short, now I am my own person! I am very happy, and I am very proud of my own struggle! One's own affairs must be fought for oneself. I believe that this sentence is no less than the secret to my success!" Saying this, she burst out laughing, and I couldn't help but laugh with admiration and congratulations.

In the continuous laughter, she waved goodbye and left. Before leaving, she also triumphantly told me to secretly tell my uncle about today's events.

Was she a runaway concubine? No! She was a brave and strong woman! A heroine among women! She is worthy of admiration and worthy of emulation! On the way home, I thought like this.

### Pyramid-Shaped Bomb Shelters

— Li Yi

Under the severe German bombing, simple and sturdy small bomb shelters have appeared in England. Their shape is like a tent or a pyramid, made of quarter-inch thick steel plates, with cement as the base. This type of bomb shelter cannot prevent direct hits from bombs, but it can protect up to fifty people from shrapnel. American businessmen, for the purpose of speculation and profit, and for the sake of preventing future troubles, are now manufacturing this type of bomb shelter in large quantities to meet the needs. The price is set at US$110 per unit. A factory in Quincey, Massachusetts, claims that once the war breaks out, the factory can manufacture 1,000 of these bomb shelters per week.

(8) Perceivable Friendship

"This person was a little strange when he came in." Dr. Yan, who was in charge of surgery, said: "He kept shouting 'Meibao, 'Meibao,' as if he was still thinking about someone!"

"That's right, he looks like he has a lot on his mind! He sleeps at most four or five hours a day, even when he is sound asleep." The nurse frowned and said.

"How is his heart?" Another bald doctor asked.

"Because of lack of sleep and decreased appetite, he looked very weak yesterday." The internist said.

"Should we send a telegram to notify his brother at the address he left?" Dr. Yan asked.

"You can discuss this with Dean Chen. I almost forgot that someone came this morning too!" The bald doctor interjected, taking out a piece of paper from the pocket of his white coat. "Someone came this morning and said he wanted to see a patient with a knife wound on his face. According to the age and figure he described, he looked like that guy named Zhou in room number seven, but the name he said was wrong, and his clothes were very worn out. He didn't look like an upper-class person, so I didn't take him upstairs. However, he left this name before leaving, repeatedly asking me to ask the person named Zhou if he wanted to see him. The address is also written here, and it is not difficult to find him. When Miss Li goes up, she might as well ask him first."

Dr. Yan adjusted the glasses on his nose and nodded to the nurse, indicating his agreement. The nurse took the piece of paper from the bald doctor's hand and left first.

"The day before yesterday, two people from the newspaper office also came to inquire about this matter," the internist said, leaning back in a wicker chair: "They both suspected that there must be very strange circumstances in this matter, and they wanted me to allow them to go up and visit. I myself didn't have any preconceived notions. Later, when Dean Chen found out, he said that the patient was too weak to see guests and drove them away for a while. I think—"

"Of course! Who doesn't think that way? How can ordinary fights cause such serious knife wounds on the face?" The bald doctor looked at the clock on the wall and hurriedly took off the white coat he was wearing. (108)

### Actors and Private Tutors

— Xi Sen

Actors employing private tutors are often criticized by modern people, who attribute it to the destruction of old rules and the decline of artistic skills. In fact, the relationship between an actor and a tutor is as close as that between the lead role and supporting characters, with a mutual dependence akin to branches and leaves supporting each other. Before the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, Peking Opera organizations were rudimentary. Actors relied solely on loud singing to win audiences, so they did not need to hire their own tutors; being able to sing was considered fulfilling their duty. Later, as theatrical arts evolved, actors continuously innovated their singing styles. As a result, tutors had to keep pace and strive for mutual improvement. The relationship between famous actors and famous tutors became inseparable, like a hand and an arm.

When the elder Tan performed, he didn't emphasize supporting roles. For robust performances, he used Jia Honglin or Liu Chunxi; for female roles, he used De Lin, Yao Qing, Yi Yun, or Gui Feng; for painted-face roles, he used Liu Hongsheng, Jin Xiushan, Huang Runfu, or Mei Rongzhai; for comic roles, he used Wang Changlin or Luo Baisui, never being too particular. However, he was extremely selective when it came to the orchestra. Drummers like Li Wu, cymbal players like Chen Jiu, and small gong players like Pan Tu'er were indispensable for any performance. Mei Yutian was almost always his chosen tutor because Tan's singing would not have been able to showcase its brilliance without Yutian's accompaniment. Chen Delin, with his naturally gifted voice, was known as the "iron throat," but his singing and modulation required Tian Baolin's musical guidance to be sonorous, gentle, and freely executed. Once, during a performance of "June Snow" with Mei Lanfang, the segment of "Surveillance" with a fast tempo was accompanied by a tutor hired by Gong. Lanfang's singing was stiff and lifeless. However, when they reached the "Execution Ground" scene, they switched to Lin Yuan, and the singing style was immediately refreshed, no longer restrained and laborious. This demonstrates that even accomplished actors like Tan, Chen, and Mei regarded employing private tutors as standard practice. Furthermore, the assistance of Chen Yanheng for the shēng actor wanting to emulate Xiaotiangua and the support of Mu Tiefen for Yanqiu in creating new melodies further proves that private tutors have contributed to the evolution of theatrical arts and should not be dismissed outright.

### Discussing Chinese Subtitles in Movie Theaters

— Xi Du

In Shanghai, first-run Western film theaters, such as the Grand Theater and the Nanjing Theater, are equipped with "translation winds," which cater to general audiences who do not understand English or have a limited proficiency, allowing them to fully understand the dialogue and plot of the films, thus providing considerable convenience. However, second-run Western film theaters have not yet initiated such an innovation. Therefore, most are equipped with Chinese subtitles, some located on the left and right sides of the screen, and others above and below the screen. Important plot points and dialogues are displayed in detailed Chinese, enabling viewers to deeply understand the film's plot.

Among the second-run theaters in Shanghai, the Chinese subtitles at the Jinmen Theater are considered the best. The wording is clear, smooth, and accurate, and important dialogues are translated in great detail, which has a similar effect to audio translation for audiences who do not understand English. The subtitles at the Lido Theater are also very detailed. However, the Lido's subtitles are located at the bottom of the screen in a horizontal format, and the handwriting is slightly cursive and displayed too quickly, making it inconvenient to read. The Chinese subtitles at the Paris Theater only display the plot of the film, without translating the dialogue. The Guanglu and Ping'an theaters do not have such facilities. The Dumei Theater often screens Soviet films, so Chinese subtitles are essential. Due to the limited space, the subtitles are located in the upper right corner of the screen, measuring over one meter high and one meter wide, making them the largest Chinese subtitles in Shanghai. Since Dumei also has a large number of Russian-speaking audience members, the subtitles are displayed with Chinese on the top half and Russian on the bottom half (or English when showing Soviet films). However, the text is simple, and the wording often does not match the on-screen content, which is its drawback.

Other theaters, such as Mingxing, are also quite detailed.

Chapter 9: Why Did You Come to the Ends of the Earth?

Xu Jing said, "Brother Liu, please go first." So, the handsome young Liu Yinying led Xu Jing towards the Phoenix Ridge opposite them. The mountains in the north are mostly rocky with few trees, possessing grandeur but lacking elegance. However, the wind on Mount Weifeng is famous in Daizhou, and Phoenix Ridge is particularly known for its secluded beauty. As Xu Jing walked, he enjoyed the scenery. Before long, they reached the ridge. In the distance, he saw a cluster of trees in the west, with a whitewashed wall and bamboo fence, and a clear spring gurgling at their feet. Approaching it, they came to a small stone bridge, with the clear spring flowing beneath. After crossing the bridge, there was a narrow path lined with pine trees, and the house became closer and closer. Within the bamboo fence were many beautiful trees and exotic flowers, red, purple, and yellow, blooming brightly. The double doors were half-open, and a weeping willow stood outside the door, its silky branches like a light mist, reflecting the green of the house. A gentle breeze blew, clearing his mind. Xu Jing secretly praised it as a hermitage! This Liu Yinying, living here, must have an extraordinary mind. Liu Yinying walked to the front of the door and pushed it open. The double doors opened. He gestured for Xu Jing to enter. Xu Jing followed him into the courtyard, which was filled with flowers. In the center was a row of three-roomed houses, with paper windows and reed curtains, simple but not plain, clean but not vulgar. An old woman in her fifties walked out of the middle room to the steps. Seeing Xu Jing, she asked Liu Yinying, "Ying'er, where did this guest come from? How did you meet him?" Liu Yinying stopped and replied, "I was walking outside when I happened to meet this Mr. Xu at the foot of Hou猊 Ridge. I helped him with a dart and killed a wolf. After asking, I learned that this Mr. Xu had come here from Henan to visit relatives but didn't find them and had nowhere to stay. I thought that people in foreign lands have no relatives to rely on, how pitiful. Helping others is helping yourself, so I invited him to stay here for a few days, until he finds out what happened. Does my aunt think I'm meddling?" Xu Jing also bowed to the old woman and said, "A traveler in a foreign land has no branch to cling to. It is rare for Brother Liu not to abandon me, and Xu is allowed to stay here. Your kindness is deeply appreciated. I beg the old lady to grant permission, and I would be most fortunate." The old woman listened to Xu Jing's gentle words and peaceful demeanor, and knew that he was a fine gentleman, so she nodded and said, "Seeing that this Mr. Xu is an honest gentleman, if he doesn't mind this humble place, then it's good for him to stay in our house for a few days. My nephew is naturally hospitable and likes lively things. He's been feeling lonely in this mountain, and Mr. Xu's arrival is just right." As she spoke, she kept looking Xu Jing up and down. Xu Jing said, "Then thank you very much for your kindness." One (165)
