### U.S. Decides to Provide Economic Aid to Strengthen China's Fighting Power; British and American Consultations on Far East Defense Cooperation; British Commander-in-Chief Pownall Arrives in Hong Kong from the Philippines

Washington – A senior government official stated yesterday that the United States intends to intensify its economic power to simultaneously weaken the Axis powers and strengthen the position of the United States and other countries opposed to the Axis. The spokesperson indicated that most of the government's measures are consistent with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's recent observation, namely, that the military phase of the Sino-Japanese War has become a thing of the past, favoring China. Hereafter the main point of the war lies in the economic aspect. Various signs here yesterday all indicated that the government is planning to implement the following seven economic activities more directly: (1) The United States has provided great assistance to China, Britain, and Greece, and has approved assistance worth $8,300,000,000 to these three countries. (2) The United States, through embargoes and export license systems, controls countless major raw materials to ensure that they do not benefit the enemy. The spokesperson stated that such items will be subject to even stricter controls when necessary. (3) The United States, by controlling shipping and shipbuilding power, is able to maintain transportation lines to friendly countries while also seizing enemy cargo ships. (4) The United States, through the purchase of military raw materials such as steel, coal, and tin, has shown friendship to certain countries while also enhancing its own war preparedness. (5) The vast reserves of food stored by the United States are an economic weapon, which will be used hereafter with a prudent attitude to assist friendly and neutral countries. (6) The United States is capable of using a $200 billion stabilization fund to assist friendly countries' currencies. (7) The United States, by freezing the assets of certain countries, can prevent such funds from being transferred to unfriendly countries to the detriment of America's friends. (United Press, 4th)

Tokyo – According to the "Asahi Shimbun" yesterday, citing news from New York, the U.S. government is currently considering banning gasoline shipments to Japan, reportedly to prevent American goods from being transshipped to Germany. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Manila – Admiral Sir Tom Phillips, Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Station, departed from here today for Hong Kong. During his two-day stay here, Phillips met with Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and Major General Grunert, commander of the Philippines Department. According to the Manila "Tribune", Phillips will return here within a week for a few days. (Reuters, 4th)

Washington – It is confirmed that British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Admiral Phillips, yesterday, while consulting with U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hart and Philippine military advisor General Grunert in Manila, comprehensively discussed the strategic position of the Philippines in the defense of British and American territories in the South Pacific. This is reportedly the first time that British and American military representatives in the Far East have made contact in this way. Washington has not yet received the details of yesterday's talks, but well-informed sources say that the outcome of the talks will certainly enable British and American defense plans in the South Pacific to achieve closer links. Here, all circles are paying great attention to Phillips's visit to the Philippines and Hong Kong. Observers say that since the Italian Navy's defeat in the Adriatic Sea, there is hope for a relaxation of the situation in the Pacific. The naval power of Britain and the United States has also greatly increased compared to before October. (News Agency Report, 4th)

Washington – Paul Vories McNutt, administrator of the Federal Security Agency, and generally regarded as a spokesman for Roosevelt, recently delivered a speech at a Far East issues forum, strongly urging the United States to provide all possible assistance to China in its war against Japan. McNutt, a former High Commissioner to the Philippines, said that although Japan could threaten the United States, he did not believe that the United States needed to wage war against Japan. However, the United States cannot abandon its position in Asia and seek compromise with any foreign country. McNutt opposed Congress's resolution to grant complete independence to the Philippines, saying that if the United States withdraws from the Pacific, it will seriously damage the prestige of the United States as a world-class nation and cause irreparable economic losses. McNutt also said that the Sino-Japanese War already has the character of preliminary actions on the outer defensive line of the Philippines and is intertwined with our hopes for peace. Therefore, he told people that all economic assistance given to China is also strengthening our own outer defensive line. (Aviation News, March 15)

New York – The "New York Times" stated today that the British-American naval and military consultations held in Manila are not intended to react to the close contact of the Axis powers, but are the natural and reasonable result of the gradual clarification of the situation in East Asia. The interests of Britain and the United States in Asia are parallel, tending towards a common goal, namely, that Eastern countries can freely solve their own problems. (United Press, 4th)

### Burma Plans to Build Railroad to Facilitate Transportation to China

Rangoon – The Burmese House of Representatives, in a motion to adjourn, discussed the Yunnan-Burma Railway due to the growing danger of Burma being drawn into the vortex of the Far East war. Several members argued that Burma should build the railway with funds provided by the British government so that Burma would have full management rights over the road. Defense Councilor Crawchet said that China has requested transit of goods through Burma, and Burma has no reason to refuse, as China is Burma's great neighbor. Is it wise for a small country not to be friendly to a large neighbor? Prime Minister Saw denied that the construction of the new railway was in danger of being strategically outflanked.

### Contents of Talks Between Generalissimo Chiang and Communist Party Representatives in Summer of the 28th Year of the Republic; First Announcement by Chinese Magazine

Chongqing – The bi-weekly magazine "The Chinese" today announced for the first time the contents of talks between Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Communist Party delegation members Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying on June 10, 1939. Generalissimo Chiang specially invited Zhou and Ye for these talks because of the many frictions between the Communist Party and the Central Government.

In his remarks, Generalissimo Chiang explained that the focus of the current Communist Party issue is not the land in a few counties in northern Shaanxi, but whether the Communist Party will sincerely obey the orders of the Central Government and implement national laws, setting an example for the Chinese revolutionary movement and not placing itself outside the national system, creating a special status, and setting a bad precedent for other reactionary elements seeking to establish independent authority. As the leader of the national revolutionary movement, in handling state affairs, he takes the upright position of the state in everything, does not listen to the private words of individuals or groups, or take a biased attitude. All resolutions are based on the state and the nation, for the sake of the doctrine of the revolutionary movement, and never seeks compromise or favoritism. The Communist Party often creates special situations in order to solve certain problems, intending to exert pressure. As the leader of the national revolutionary movement, he must fairly resolve various problems in the spirit of revolution, so he cannot tolerate this attitude. He then urged the Communist Party to sincerely obey the orders of the Central Government and restore normalcy. If they do so, then he will never discriminate against the Communist Party. He said that he always emphasizes benevolence in this matter, and this is also true of the Communist Party. All orders or reprimands are actually for the sake of protecting the Communist Party, hoping that the party can set a good example in the national revolutionary movement. Everything he does has national unification and independence as its sole purpose. If there is no unification, then there can be no independence, so the effort to achieve unification is entirely for the benefit of the state and the nation, which should also be the goal of the Chinese Communist Party. According to the magazine, a new publication in Chongqing, its articles almost all discuss Communist Party affairs. The latest issue exposes Ye Ting, commander of the New Fourth Army, and blames Xiang Ying, deputy commander of the army, saying that Xiang disobeyed the orders of the commander-in-chief and only obeyed the directives of the Yan'an Communist Party authorities.

Editorial

### The Shanghai People's Food Supply in the Third Stage

The price of rice in Shanghai is rising daily, and the rice market is deteriorating daily. Looking back, it can be said that it has now entered the third stage. Since rice and grain in the occupied areas were looted, the price of rice in Shanghai began to rise, leading to the method of setting a price limit for national rice. And when the price limit was relaxed but still could not be maintained, it was finally forced to be abandoned, this was the first stage. This stage lasted from after the Chinese army withdrew westward to the end of the 28th year of the Republic of China. The price rose directly from about 20 yuan per picul to more than 40 yuan. Then, from the abandonment of the national rice price limit, to the exclusive evaluation of the price of foreign rice, and the rise of foreign rice to the main position in the diet of residents, it lasted for a year until the rice and grain evaluation committee virtually disappeared at the end of March of this year. It repeatedly broke through the price limit, resulting in secret price subsidies, and the price of rice gradually became ten times higher than before the war, such as the foreign rice price of more than 110 yuan in March of this year, this was the second stage. During this period, the rice price surge was the most violent. Now, the third stage is just beginning, the future is long, and there are many changes. When will it come to an end? Probably after the quelling of the rebellion?

Looking at the overall trend and weighing the situation, the people's food supply in the third stage is self-evidently the most serious period, but it is also not necessarily a time of change. Looking at it from the perspective of change: (1) the seasonal changes of rice and grain become more intense as summer approaches. The period of shortage between crops is approaching, and it is already rising in normal times, and it is even worse now. (2) Fertilizers such as bean cake are all extremely expensive; in addition, if food is expensive, then labor is also expensive. Since the production cost of rice is high, the price of new rice is also difficult to level. (3) If the parasitic groups are not removed for a single day, then even if the output in the occupied areas is abundant, it will still not alleviate the urgency of the people's food supply. Moreover, they are still competing with us for overseas grain. The reason why Saigon rice is not coming is that there are 700,000 tons being transported. (4) Not only is there no rice being transported from the occupied areas to Shanghai, but Shanghai is relied upon for relief. As a result, Shanghai rice merchants are even more hoarding goods, the rise in rice prices is well-justified, and the hoarding wind is irresistible. (5) With the outbreak of the European war, many ships were requisitioned. With the shortage of ships, the water freight rate is rising steadily. If, as rumored in the market, it costs 140 shillings to transport a ton of rice from Rangoon to Shanghai, which is almost equal to the price of a ton of rice, then half of the cost of a picul of rice in Shanghai is transportation costs. If the war is prolonged and the freight rate rises again, will it not cause the price of rice to rise accordingly? (6) It is difficult to ask for a reasonable solution to the Shanghai grain market. Although the theory is good, it does not match the facts; although the intention is good, it cannot be communicated with human feelings. It is neither possible to act rashly, nor can it be perfunctorily. Nor can it be biased towards the interests of one part, and think that this is all there is to food administration. All these biased views will not only fail to benefit the people's food supply, but will also make it more chaotic like untangling silk.

Based on the above, it seems that there is no solution to the Shanghai people's food supply, but this is not the case. What is most difficult today is the inability to use Chinese grain to relieve China's urgent needs, so we have to seek it from foreign lands. If we seek it from foreign lands, then the market price will be at the mercy of others, and the various additional losses such as exchange rates, transportation, and insurance cannot be avoided, and the price of rice is not easy to stabilize. Since this is already a fact, then we can only endure the pain of temporarily high-priced rice and grain, and wait for the future. Although the rice of Thailand and Vietnam is monopolized by Japanese merchants, what Japanese merchants trade with is not cash, but Japanese goods, which are not willingly accepted by the people of Thailand and Vietnam. Moreover, there are things that cannot be exchanged for Japanese goods, and there is still rice from Burma. Burmese rice is not easy to buy without cash. If you want to compete with China for purchase, the method of competition is the same as China's, which is foreign exchange. This is something that the Japanese do not do, and they have no power to do so. Burma is a British colony, and China and Britain are planning to cooperate, so using Burmese grain to relieve China's food supply, using British merchants' ships to transport British colonial grain, even in the autumn of frequent military transport, it is not difficult to allocate some to meet the needs of the Chinese people's food supply. This should be a matter that is permitted by reason and sentiment. Moreover, the Shanghai Municipal Council already has a ship chartering committee, so there is no need to worry that transportation will not be sufficient; the water freight problem will also be resolved relatively well with the solution of the ship chartering problem. In order to protect the security of the concession, the French Concession Bureau will inevitably take the same steps, transporting Vietnamese rice to Shanghai, thinking that it will not disappear because it is transported by Japanese merchants. In this way, rice and grain in Shanghai may be expensive, but it will not be out of stock. If we are concerned about Japan's southward advance, which will prevent Burmese rice from coming as well, although this is not an over-concern, the changes in the world are difficult to predict. What the Japanese value most is to subdue people without fighting. Now the war in East Africa is expected to end, the changes in the Balkans are unpredictable, and the United States' assistance to constitutional countries is proceeding step by step. The British and American military commanders in the Far East are also in close talks. As a result, Matsuoka was about to travel to Europe, but suddenly there was news that he had been summoned back home. Then, the issue of realizing the southward advance becomes even more confusing. How do you know that you don't worry about the disaster of paper-made wooden houses, abandon Zhang and vote for Wei, and appease them? Even if it is not the case, now the ships of the Municipal Council are transferring food needed by local people. In any case, they should not willingly destroy and hinder the transportation of grain in a corner of Shanghai. This can also be proved by the fact that the transportation of food to the French free zone is not subject to blockade restrictions. Shanghai is not France, which can further believe that it will not be interfered with. In this way, even if there is a war in Southeast Asia, in Shanghai's position, it is not difficult to obtain possible relief from Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma. What is difficult is the distribution problem of Shanghai rice and grain. This problem is extremely complicated. Distributing grain according to households and purchasing rice in groups are theoretically good, but how much does group purchase of rice benefit the Shanghai people's food supply? Or it has never been the case. Distributing grain according to population is even more difficult and cannot be done in a hurry. Even managing the distribution of cheap grain is still easy to do, but people still say that there is collusion and embezzlement from it; they also say that they rely on power to buy strongly, and no one dares to say anything; or they buy and sell together, and sell to other places to make profits. The truly poor people have to run around for days without being able to buy rice; then if you want to distribute grain according to population, if there is no detailed population survey first, followed by household registration changes, if you still entrust it to rice shops and rice numbers to resell to food households, then the leakage will be huge and the abuses will be endless. Then how can we distinguish whether they are poor people or non-poor people buying? As for the grain transported by the Ship Chartering Committee of the Municipal Council, whether it will be grain for commercial use or for public use, there has been no definite decision. If it is grain for public use, and there is a meaning of helping the poor, then the issue of how to distribute and resell the grain, check and prevent abuses is also difficult. Moreover, commercial rice will also be transported to supply the needs of the city's food supply, then the quality of the rice does not have to be limited to any number, and the government should still have considerable control in all aspects of procurement and sales. It is important to know that dealing with the entire food problem is not a passive relief effort, but an active construction. Now that we are困于环境, unable to adjust from production, and only remedy the transportation and sales, it is appropriate to take advantage of the fact that the price limit is being invisibly removed, which is the most appropriate time to correct the management of Shanghai's food supply. First, the price of rice is already so high, second, the existing stock is so abundant, third, the orders are so abundant, and transportation and water freight have a considerable solution, then what is lacking is only an imperfect distribution method. To remove the excess, supplement the deficiency, and put it into the궤物, it is not difficult to find someone who can take on this difficult task in Shanghai.

### Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee - Summary of Resolutions: Centralized Management of Land Taxes in All Provinces; Establishment of a Ministry of Trade and a Ministry of Food within the Executive Yuan; Mobilizing All Resources to Establish a Wartime Economic System

Chongqing (Continued from Yesterday) Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee:

(3) In order to meet wartime needs, it is proposed to transfer the management of land taxes in all provinces to the central government for unified planning and reorganization (submitted by the Director-General). Approved by resolution.

Main points of the proposal and reasons: Land tax in our country has always been a national tax. Since the promulgation of the standards for the division of national and local revenue and expenditure in the seventeenth year of the Republic [1928], land tax has been classified as local revenue. Provinces have regarded it as a major source of income, and most have increased land taxes to meet their needs, resulting in inconsistent tax rates and various surcharges. The burden is uneven, and the people are troubled by it. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance, for the purpose of reorganization, requested the approval of the land reporting method and supervised the provinces to complete it within a time limit. After several years of implementation, some progress has been made, but since the outbreak of the war, most of it has been suspended. However, simultaneous progress in resistance and construction is the established national policy of the central government, and the aforementioned reporting method should be actively continued. Recently, food prices have soared, and land profits have increased, affecting military and civilian food supplies. It is impossible to enrich the country and benefit the people without reorganizing land taxes. Wartime finance relies on unified planning, and the central and local governments are a unified whole. Division leads to small scale and difficulty in advancement, while unity leads to strength and rapid results. Therefore, in order to adjust local revenue and expenditure and balance the land burden, it is urgent to transfer the collection of land taxes in all provinces to the central government for reorganization in order to meet the needs of the war. The reasons are as follows: (1) The tax rates for land tax in various localities are inconsistent and uneven, and limited by their location, it is impossible to carry out large-scale reforms. After central management, it is possible to actively complete land reporting and handle land value tax, so that tax rates are fair and excessive charges are abolished. (2) After the central government reorganizes land taxes and taxes land value appropriately, the revenue can be increased by more than four times compared to the current amount. In addition to offsetting the originally set amount of land tax, financial assistance can be appropriately provided based on the financial situation of various localities, so that local education, culture, healthcare, and sanitation can be effectively promoted, and national economic construction can be evenly developed through financial regulation. (3) According to the National Construction Outline, the burden of each county on the central government should be a percentage of the annual income of each county for central government expenses. Therefore, land tax revenue cannot be exclusively for local use. If it is managed by the central government, the central government's unified revenue and expenditure can lead to a reasonable allocation. (4) In order to regulate military and civilian food supplies in various regions, the central government can make overall plans and adjust the situation of supply and demand in various regions, changing to levy in kind, storing, transporting, and providing relief, so that production and sales can be balanced and food prices can be stabilized. (5) When land tax is unified by the central government for unified revenue and expenditure, the connection between central and local finances will be closer, and the local tax system can be effectively adjusted under the guidance of the central government. All conflicting taxes can be abolished. (6) Centralized collection of land tax by the central government will make affairs and expenses more rational and economical.

Methods (Omitted)

(4) Proposal to establish a Ministry of Trade and a Ministry of Food within the Executive Yuan (submitted by the Director-General). Approved by resolution.

The original proposal involves the management of import and export trade and foreign barter, as well as the management of national food. In this wartime, its mission is particularly important. It is proposed to establish a Ministry of Trade and a Ministry of Food within the Executive Yuan to strengthen its powers and increase its business efficiency. The original Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance and the National Food Administration should be abolished. A special request is made to the Congress for a decision.

(5) Proposal to actively mobilize human, material, and financial resources to establish a wartime economic system (submitted by the Presidium). Approved by resolution and referred to the Standing Committee for attention.

Original text of the proposal and reasons: In wartime, the sustainability of a nation's economic strength is the key to final victory, and the ability of economic strength to cooperate with military development depends on the soundness of its organization and flexible application. Since our country has been at war for three and a half years, measures in various economic sectors have established a solid foundation. At present, the Japanese military has been trapped in a difficult situation for a long time, and is only focusing on economic blockade against us, gradually pressing closer. However, the prices in our rear still have a tendency to gradually rise. Therefore, future countermeasures should actively mobilize national human, material, and financial resources to strengthen the wartime economic system, so as to increase production, ensure fair distribution, and strictly implement frugal consumption, so that all economic forces can be used in a planned and controlled manner. The needs of the military will be guaranteed, and the certainty of victory in the war lies in this. Therefore, the current priority is to establish a wartime economic system and implement wartime economic laws and regulations, so that personnel serving in economic affairs are aware of the special importance of their responsibilities, and the general public should also attach importance to the status and contribution of economic personnel, so as to actively improve the spirit of self-reliance and self-respect of economic personnel, and to achieve the goal of economic combat victory. It is urgent to first decide the basic policy by the Congress and hand it over to the competent government authorities to earnestly formulate specific implementation methods and organizations. Now, we respectfully propose ten outlines for establishing a wartime economic system for discussion at the meeting. Please make a public decision.

Basic Outlines for Establishing a Wartime Economic System: (1) Confirm that the economic struggle in the current situation is the main key to victory, abandon all outdated and untimely economic concepts, and replace them with the basic beliefs of military first and economic national defense, and establish the direction of efforts for the wartime economic system. (2) All Party comrades should deeply understand the importance of the new era of national defense economic policies, lead the national people, and promote it with all their strength, regardless of any difficulties and costs, to achieve the ultimate goal of victory in the war. (3) Decide on unified steps, and set a minimum period to enrich and adjust economic institutions at all levels, paying special attention to basic organizations such as financial and tax authorities, cooperative organizations, transportation agencies, anti-smuggling agencies, and salt and grain management agencies, and establish sound economic institutions as a stronghold for the implementation of comprehensive economic control. (4) Mobilize national professionals and allocate them to economic institutions at all levels, so that they can take on management and technical work, determine their powers and responsibilities, and protect their status, so that they can become cadres for economic operations. (5) Mobilize outstanding young people across the country, conduct short-term training, and fill the ranks of economic combatants. Their importance should be recognized as equal to that of soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front line, and the state should give them the same preferential treatment and awards as front-line soldiers. (6) Mobilize workers, farmers, and women across the country to organize and train them in stages and actively engage in production. (7) Economic institutions should be unified under military management and scientific management, with clear division of responsibilities, simplified procedures, to achieve military-style speed and reality, and determine efficiency standards, and conduct regular assessments. The treatment of personnel at all levels should be adjusted to make it rational, and paid in kind when necessary. (8) For people's economic activities, from the production process to final consumption, a systematic plan should be made for control, and gradually strengthened, so that it can be fully controlled to match military operations. (9) For key businesses such as finance, trade, transportation, and production, the expansion of state-owned enterprises, the combination of private enterprises, and the strengthening of ties should be used to make them an entire collective of economic operations, and public operation methods and financial means should be used to strive for fair distribution. For the minimum needs of people's lives, the government should make overall plans, stabilize prices, and distribute them through public and cooperative means. At the same time, mobilize the people to strictly implement frugality and gradually develop the habit of collective life. (3rd Dispatch)(End)

### Guo Taiqi's Conversation with British Reporters: Highly Praising the Indomitable Spirit of the British; British Government and Public Expressed Regret at Guo's Return to China

London - Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, who has been newly appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs and is about to return to China to take office, told reporters from the Daily Telegraph today that he felt a mixture of regret and hope at his decision to leave the United Kingdom. He said that he was deeply reluctant to part with the friends he had made in the United Kingdom over the past eight or nine years, and that he admired the indomitable spirit of the British people in recent months. He added that the Chinese people had had the same experience, and that he knew that the spirit of the British people had never flagged even in the darkest times.

The spirit of the Chinese people is also the same, because bombing can often strengthen the determination of free people. The diplomatic correspondent of the Times claimed that British diplomatic circles and many non-official figures would express infinite regret at the departure of Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. During his tenure as ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo handled his country's affairs with a calm and persistent attitude. There would have been many disappointments, but he never showed any pain. His departure now comes at a time when the cause of freedom-loving people around the world has been united. President Roosevelt has placed China alongside Britain and Greece, and Britain, which has aided China in many ways, has also firmly refused to sacrifice China in the Far East to seek a compromise. Guo has earned the respect of all for his difficult work, and his new position will be even more difficult at a time when the Japanese Foreign Minister is seeking to sever Soviet aid to China. As Guo departs from the United Kingdom to return to China, he is asked to bring back the blessings and respect of one country resisting aggression to another country with the same fate, and to convey them to the Chairman of China.

### Academia Sinica Establishes Ant Guangyan Scholarship

Chongqing - The late Ant Guangyan, an overseas Chinese in Thailand, spared no effort in promoting and supporting overseas Chinese education in Thailand and schools in the motherland. After Ant's martyrdom, overseas Chinese in Thailand held a public memorial service and collected 25,000 yuan in paper money. Ant's family upheld his last wishes, and in addition to all the paper money, they raised a huge sum of money to raise a total of 50,000 national currency, which was handed over to the Thai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to request the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to transfer it to Academia Sinica to set up (Ant Guangyan Academic Scholarship) to promote culture and commemorate it. Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, has sent this scholarship to Academia Sinica, and it is said that the Academy has agreed to set up (Ant Guangyan Academic Scholarship) and is currently drafting implementation methods, which will be announced soon. In addition, Academia Sinica has set up two kinds of scholarships in memory of the late cadres Yang Quan and Ding Wenjiang, namely the Yang Quan Scholarship and the Ding Wenjiang Scholarship.

Then, representatives from the provinces and cities of Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, and Chongqing successively reported. In the afternoon, the Second Special Committee began to review proposals on cooperative finance. The central issue was the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Social Affairs to establish central and provincial/county/city cooperative treasuries to establish a cooperative financial system. The discussion was very heated. (4th Dispatch)

Chairman Chiang's Address

Chongqing - Chairman Chiang's address on the opening day of the National Cooperation Conference is as follows: "The Ministry of Social Affairs is convening the National Cooperation Conference, which I believe is of great significance, and I hope it will achieve very good results. Our war and national construction must be firmly based on the Three People's Principles as the highest criterion, and then the war can be won and the national construction can be successful. Therefore, our social and economic construction must also have the characteristics of the Three People's Principles cooperative enterprise. In the spirit of equality, mutual assistance, and cooperation, and with the means of peaceful struggle, self-reliance, and regeneration, we can unite our forces, transform society, and establish a new social and economic system that is fully consistent with the ideals of the Three People's Principles national, democratic, and livelihood construction. Therefore, your joint efforts in promoting cooperative enterprises are worthy of being the backbone of the Three People's Principles construction. In recent years, our country's cooperative enterprises have shown a sudden leap forward, which is very gratifying. In the future, the universal implementation of the new county system and the cooperative enterprises will proceed in coordination, and its development should be even more rapid. However, to date, cooperative administration in various provinces, cities, and counties is not fully sound, cooperative enterprises have not been able to enrich cooperative education, and cooperative finance needs to be flexible and smooth. In the future, we must earnestly reorganize and strive for improvement, so that the Three People's Principles social and economic construction can truly establish a foundation in cooperative enterprises. There are high expectations. (3rd Dispatch)

### German Troops Assist in North Africa; British Troops Abandon Benghazi and Retreat to Positions North of Agedabia; British Troops in East Africa Force Massawa to Surrender

Berlin - According to the German military headquarters, after a German-Italian coalition force engaged British troops in North Africa, the British troops lost the bases of El Agheila and Biri Sulah and retreated from Agedabia. At the same time, they were repeatedly bombed by German and Italian air forces. (Haitong, 4th)

Cairo - It was officially announced that after the advance British troops in Libya retreated to positions north of Agedabia (about 100 miles south of Benghazi), the British troops in the Cyrenaica area had also withdrawn from the key port of Benghazi. Benghazi was occupied by the British troops who advanced rapidly along the coast from Derna on February 6. (Reuters, 4th)

Berlin - In North Africa, German and Italian troops occupied Himennes south of Benghazi yesterday. (Haitong, 4th)

London - A special correspondent for Reuters with the army reported that the British army has now demanded the surrender of the port of Massawa. A total of 3,000 Italian soldiers captured by the British army in Asmara. Cairo has issued a special bulletin explaining the reasons for the withdrawal from Benghazi, stating that in view of the strong German and Italian troops advancing resolutely with many tanks and in order to choose our own battlefield, all the light cover units have been withdrawn to choose a concentrated area. Benghazi is militarily indefensible and the British army did not use it as a port. This time, all the captured military supplies and equipment were destroyed before the withdrawal. The British army inflicted heavy losses on enemy vehicles, soldiers, and tanks. (Reuters, 4th)

Cairo - A British military spokesman here said last night that before the British army entered Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, the Italian colonial army rioted and looted the city. The Italian bishop and police chief of the city, in order to protect the safety of the Italian families in the city, appealed to the British army to occupy the city and restore order. From this, it can be seen that the remaining Italian army in East Africa is suffering from the threat of serious internal unrest. The latest British communiqué stated that the British army captured many enemies in Eritrea and obtained many cannons and a large number of war materials. They are currently advancing south from Asmara. After the enemy's mechanized army in Libya moved, the British advance troops moved to positions north of Agedabia. The spokesman said that the war in Libya was a small contact and had no special importance. In addition, the British Air Force Command in the Middle East issued a communiqué stating that the British Air Force continued to attack the Italian military transport vehicles retreating south of Asmara in Eritrea yesterday. The Free French bombed the enemy camp on the Avenue of Adduwa. Motor transport vehicles on the Taixi to Asassa Avenue were also strafed and bombed, and many vehicles were damaged. On Wednesday, four enemy bombers attempted to attack Volos (Greece) and were intercepted by central fighter planes. Three were shot down and another was severely damaged. On the 1st of this month, the British Air Force launched a night attack on the port of Tripoli, hitting the breakwater. Enemy transport vehicles were also heavily attacked and destroyed. No British aircraft were lost. The communiqué also announced that the British army had occupied Messu, about 180 miles from Addis Ababa, stating that the British aircraft and army cooperated and repeatedly bombed the enemy's formations and its traffic, which was quite effective. A British military spokesman said that after the South African army estimated Messu, it is now putting pressure on the enemy. Cairo expects Addis Ababa to be declared a demilitarized city, because there are many Italian women and children there. (Reuters, 4th)

### British Aircraft Night Attack on German Naval Base; Two 20,000-Ton German Ships Sunk

London - This afternoon, the Ministry of Aviation announced that during the British aircraft's air raid on Brest last night, it was witnessed that the German 26,000-ton battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had sunk. The Scharnhorst was the first battlecruiser built by Germany after the Great War. The Gneisenau was its sister ship. It was launched in 1934 and completed on May 21, 1938. The Gneisenau was completed in September of the same year. The ship's military equipment includes nine 11-inch heavy guns, twelve 5.9-inch guns, fourteen 4.1-inch anti-aircraft guns, sixteen 37-caliber anti-aircraft guns, and four aircraft. The total number of crew members is 1,461. The Scharnhorst officially joined the fleet for service in Wilhelmshaven on January 7, 1939. (Reuters, 4th)

### The Southern Government Has Already Announced: The Capital Is a Demilitarized City; The Southern Prime Minister Is Determined to Uphold Independence; Machek Accepts the Position of Deputy Prime Minister

London – Southern National Capital Radio claimed last night that the Southern Capital had been declared a "demilitarized city," and the authorities warned the people to implement a blackout at any time. At the same time, Southern Capital officially announced that Croat leader Machek had accepted the position of Deputy Prime Minister in the new Southern National Government. According to news from Southern Capital, Machek is now departing from Zagreb to head to Southern Capital with the belief of doing his utmost to maintain peace and join the Simović cabinet. Machek said to guests, "I believe that I should do my best to maintain peace, which is the highest blessing for mankind. I deeply believe that the Serbian leaders and people also sincerely desire peace." (Reuters, 4th)

Southern National Mobilization: Already Completed

Rome – According to Southern German refugees entering the country, passenger trains in Southern National are now completely suspended, and only military vehicles can pass. Although the general mobilization has not been announced by the authorities, it has already been completed. Reservists of the Serbian ethnic group born in 1893 have also been mobilized, and the descendants of Germans have been mobilized up to the 1900 age group, mostly for labor services. A large number of people are now fleeing military service into the country of Romania, and the Romanian border guards are assisting the entry of German refugees. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Belgrade – Dr. Jian Ge, the leader of the German ethnic group in Yugoslavia, was recently invited to a meeting by General Simović, the Prime Minister of Southern National. It is said that Jian Ge is now on his way to Belgrade. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Germany Claims Tolerance Has Its Limits

A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson claimed yesterday that the shocking events regarding the latest developments in Southern National's situation are the anti-German activities of Southern National's foreign envoys, supported by the Southern National government, hoping to gain foreign intervention in Southeast Europe. Not only do the powerful countries of Europe want to interfere in Southeast Europe, but even countries across the ocean have expressed this attitude. Whether Southern National's agreement to foreign intervention is in accordance with the basic principles of the Three-Power Pact is not up for discussion at this time. The anti-German sentiment in Southern National can be seen in the anti-German demonstrations and riots. The Southern National government has not stopped these terrorist actions at all, and its diplomats have fueled the flames, making the current diplomatic and political problems even more difficult. The people of Southern National have no understanding of the serious situation caused by the government reorganization and the riots and acts of terror, and they are not aware of the scope of the crisis. The spokesperson confirmed that the German envoy to Southern National, He Lun, is still in Berlin, but did not say when he would return to his post. Regarding the rumors that Southern National's envoy, An Teli Zhi, brought a special official document from the Southern National government to Germany, he said he had not heard of it. The decision on German-Southern National relations depends on the attitude of the Belgrade government, not Berlin. Germany is observing the developments in Southern National's affairs with the greatest tolerance and patience, but it is difficult to say how long Germany's tolerance can last.

Rumor: Southern Prime Minister Will Go to Rome

Vichy – It is rumored that General Simović, the Prime Minister of the Southern National Cabinet, intends to dispatch a special envoy to Rome, or go in person, to request the Italian government to mediate the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. Regarding this matter, diplomatic figures here recently said that although Italy does not want the situation in the Balkans to become unmanageable, it also does not want the relationship between Germany and Yugoslavia to break down. As for the choice of a special envoy, Southern National's Foreign Minister, Ning Xie Zhi, signed an agreement with Italy in 1934, so if there is a trip to Rome, he would be the most suitable person. Italy is unwilling to volunteer to mediate and must wait for Southern National to request it before it is willing to do so. As far as Southern National's attitude is concerned, it seems that the country wants to avoid the deterioration of the situation. After several cabinet meetings, a policy has been decided, and it is said that the content focuses on internal stability and external resistance. The Croat problem will be solved first. The Croat leader, Machek, has already accepted the position of cabinet assistant, and the agreement established in 1939 (stipulating that the Croatian region be divided into a province and granted autonomy) has also been reaffirmed by the government. In terms of diplomacy, although the new cabinet has stated that it will not neglect the obligations undertaken by the previous government in joining the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is not yet known whether the German government is willing to accept this opinion and whether Southern National will provide other guarantees such as the demobilization of the Southern National Army.

During the meeting, Ambassador Gabrielović solemnly stated his views on maintaining Southern National's neutrality and independence. (Reuters, 4th)

### After Teleki's Suicide, Bardossy Appointed Prime Minister; Hungary's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; The Late Prime Minister's State Funeral Set for the 7th

Budapest – It was announced here last night that Hungarian Foreign Minister Bardossy had been appointed Prime Minister to succeed the late Teleki. Mr. Bardossy will also serve concurrently as Foreign Minister, as a way to ensure that Hungary's foreign policy does not change. Other cabinet members have not been changed. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki was the first victim of Hungary's joining the Tripartite Pact, and committed suicide because he "could not carry out his difficult and unpleasant task." The reason why Teleki could not bear this burden was that Germany put pressure on Hungary, forcing it to break with Southern National. One of Teleki's proudest achievements during his tenure was the establishment of an agreement with Southern National, removing the cause of political friction between the two countries and establishing a foundation of harmony, cooperation, mutual trust, and economic understanding. It seems that the German side cannot tolerate its vassal state Hungary living in friendship with the independent-minded Southern National, causing Teleki to feel unable to cope with the struggle between his principles and German pressure, so he resorted to suicide. In the Hungarian capital, there is no shortage of politicians who can be used by the German side as tools and used at will, but Hungarian Regent Horthy has always been independent, so his choice of Teleki's successor, even if it does not hinder the German plan, will prevent the German plan from being realized early. Bulgaria also has a treaty of friendship with Southern National, and this treaty is welcomed by the Bulgarian people. Now the Bulgarian people are also under the same pressure and have risen in opposition. The closeness between the Bulgarian people and the Serbian people of Southern National has made a great contribution to the peace of the Balkan Peninsula. Even if the German side drives the Bulgarian people to make open expressions of hatred toward Southern National, it will be difficult to destroy the relationship between the Bulgarian and Southern National peoples. According to dispatches from the Hungarian capital, Teleki committed suicide by shooting himself in the right temple with a pistol. The official news agencies of Germany and Italy in the Hungarian capital reported that Hungarian Regent Horthy has invited Bardossy to serve as Prime Minister, and Bardossy has accepted. It is noted that Bardossy has a good reputation in London diplomatic circles, having served as a counselor and chargé d'affaires at the Hungarian Embassy in the UK for many years. He left London in 1934 to serve as the Hungarian ambassador to Romania, and became Foreign Minister in 1938. According to news from the Hungarian capital, Mr. Bardossy will continue to serve concurrently as Foreign Minister, and there will be no changes in other ministries. (Reuters, 4th)

The Hungarian capital – According to news that has not yet been confirmed by the government here, it was reported yesterday that Chancellor Hitler demanded that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki have Hungary join the war and fight against [Missing country name]. After this request was made, Teleki committed suicide. Teleki was pessimistic about Hungary's future, so after a night-long cabinet meeting, he committed suicide in his bedroom yesterday morning. According to Teleki's friends, the Hungarian Prime Minister had always opposed joining the Axis powers, and recently became pessimistic about Hungary's future, predicting that Hungary might become a battlefield between the Axis powers and the Allied forces. (International News Agency, 4th)

The Hungarian capital – The body of Cabinet Prime Minister Teleki was recently examined by forensic doctors, proving that he died by suicide at one or two o'clock this morning by shooting himself in the right forehead with a Browning pistol. According to Teleki's former attendants, when they entered the Prime Minister's bedroom at 6:45 this morning, they found his body lying on the floor, already cold. The Prime Minister ordered me last night to call him to get up as usual and prepare the Boy Scout uniform so that he could participate in the Boy Scout service this morning. His attitude was no different from usual. In addition, it is also learned that the Prime Minister left behind two letters, one to his beloved wife, and the contents of the other letter and to whom it was addressed are still unknown. As for the rumors that the Prime Minister's wife has also committed suicide, this is incorrect. However, the wife has been feeling unwell for a long time and is now recuperating in a private hospital. The government authorities have also announced that a state funeral will be held for the late Prime Minister at 10:00 a.m. on the 7th of this month. (Havas News Agency, 4th)

### Student Demonstration in Front of the American Embassy in Rome

Rome – Hundreds of Italian students gathered around the American Embassy, shouting "Down with the Democratic Countries," "Long Live Japan," causing a conflict with the police. After being dispersed by the military police, they reorganized and headed to the Yugoslav Embassy, shouting "Reclaim Dalmatia" (the coast of Yugoslavia), but they were again dispersed by the military police. Finally, hundreds of students gathered in front of Venice Square and performed the Fascist salute. (Associated Press, 4th)

### Romania Announces Suspension of Foreign Debt Payments

Bucharest – The Romanian Ministry of Finance announced yesterday that due to the dramatic changes in the international economic situation, as well as the shrinking of domestic territory and the depletion of economic strength, Romania has no choice but to suspend payments on various foreign debts, even though agreements have been made in the past. The responsibility for resolving the various issues related to this matter cannot be borne by Romania alone, but the Romanian government is prepared to negotiate the future issues of debt with the governments of the countries concerned.

### Matsuoka Returns to Berlin from Rome; Meets with German Dignitaries Again

Milan – At 11:30 last night, the special train carrying Matsuoka and his entourage arrived at the Brenner Pass. When the train arrived at the border between Germany and Italy, Matsuoka first bid farewell to the Italian officials who were escorting him, and then met with officials sent by the German Foreign Minister to greet him, and took the same train to Berlin. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Berlin – According to news here, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is expected to arrive here from Rome at 2:25 p.m. today. He will stay here until tomorrow night and meet with German dignitaries again. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

London – Diplomatic figures here recently said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has tried to avoid taking responsibility for attacking the British colonial empire. This avoidance is obviously because Matsuoka is deeply afraid of triggering a Japanese-American war as a result. Japanese figures here said that Tokyo has ordered Matsuoka to return quickly and stop his trip to Vichy. It is speculated that this is the reason why the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Shigemitsu Aoi, changed his plan to fly to mainland Europe to meet Matsuoka. In addition, well-informed people are quite skeptical about whether Matsuoka's visit to Moscow again will produce a non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union. According to reliable sources, Matsuoka's one-hour talk with Stalin last week only discussed general issues, and most of the time was spent on translation. (Associated Press, 4th)

Berlin – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka may arrive here from Rome today. Many Japanese ambassadors in Europe are waiting here for the arrival of the Japanese Foreign Minister. Matsuoka has summoned most of the Japanese ambassadors, ministers, and chargés d'affaires to hold a meeting. Except for the ambassadors to Rome, London, and Moscow, the rest have arrived here today. Matsuoka left the St. Paul's Station in Rome at 8 o'clock last night, and was seen off by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and senior government officials. News from London said that Shigemitsu Aoi, the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, has cancelled his plan to meet with Matsuoka in Vichy. (Associated Press, 4th)

### Japanese Side Feels Resentful About Fletcher's Remarks; Britain Has Apologized to Shigemitsu

Tokyo – According to news reported from London, Fletcher, the Private Secretary of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, Alexander, said in a certain radio speech on March 29 that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's trip to Berlin seemed to cause many British people to think about the position of the Japanese Ambassador in London. Ambassadors and their entourages often have many opportunities to report events that are beneficial to the enemy. They often observe us when we are fighting the enemy with bare hands and broomsticks. There is no reason to tolerate seemingly hostile observers in our midst while wearing kid gloves to deal with this matter. When the Information Bureau spokesman Ishii received foreign news reporters today, he mentioned this matter, saying that the Japanese ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi had asked the British Foreign Office to pay attention to Mr. Fletcher's remarks. British Under-Secretary Butler has acknowledged that his remarks are not "appropriate" and has apologized to Shigemitsu Aoi. (Reuters, 4th)

European War Talks (43)

### The Inside Story of Germany During Wartime

What is more serious than the damage to factories is the working time wasted by workers during air raids and the sharp decline in work efficiency caused by insomnia. The skilled workers in German munitions factories have worked incredibly long hours in the past and present. At the beginning of the war, some factory workers worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Under such circumstances, the workers' health, discipline, and efficiency were greatly hampered, so the working hours were slightly reduced later. But recently, workers in German factories still have to work an average of 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.

The industrialists who run factories everywhere have to go to Berlin every other week on weekends for a good sleep, which shows that the sleep problem has already affected the management of the factories. By Saturday afternoon, the doorways of the city's hotels are hung with "Do Not Disturb" signs. Inside the double-door bedrooms, one can only hear the exhausted industrial giants snoring loudly. German workers, however, cannot enjoy such a blessing of rest.

Until I left Berlin last December, the Basdan and Anhalter stations in the city center of Berlin had never been hit by British Air Force bombs. But later, on one occasion, the sky above Berlin did not detect British aircraft, but a mysterious explosion occurred at Anhalter station, and the building caught fire, burning down part of the station. Some of the damage in Berlin, of course, also escaped the eyes of American journalists. When Berlin was first bombed, the authorities often took us to inspect the places that were reported to have been most heavily bombed. Later, the attacks by British aircraft became commonplace, and this kind of inspection was abolished. Except for the announcements issued by the highest military command and the propaganda department, not a word of news about each bombing of Berlin was allowed to be leaked. I personally heard British bombers flying overhead several times and witnessed anti-aircraft guns in the city firing one after another, but the next day's announcement still said that British aircraft had not invaded the airspace of Berlin.

Why isn't the damage caused by the British Air Force bombing of Berlin very serious? This is because when the British Air Force invaded Berlin, the number of aircraft was too small and the bombs they carried were not heavy enough to cause serious damage to London like the German Air Force did. The aviation consultants of neutral countries had different estimates of the number of British aircraft attacking Berlin, but according to the closest estimates, at most 30 British aircraft bombed Berlin each night, and the average was 15. Taking the entire German territory as a whole, the number of British aircraft flying into German territory on a good night ranged from 60 to 80. The British military uses Wellington and Blenheim aircraft, which are long-range aircraft, to attack Germany. But one night, the German side shot down a modified Lockheed British aircraft in the city. The news that the German side shot down the first American aircraft in Berlin was kept strictly secret in Germany, and American journalists were not allowed to spread this news.

The German aircraft used heavy bombs to attack London, while the British aircraft only dropped light bombs on Berlin. The reason is very simple, it is just a mathematical relationship. The bombers used by the German Air Force to attack England only travel 200 miles round trip. There is no need to carry too much gasoline on such a short flight, and the bombs carried are 500 pounds, 1,000 pounds, and even 2,000 pounds. The British Air Force must fly 1,100 miles round trip for each attack on Berlin. They mostly carry 100-pound bombs, but later we also felt that there were also bombs weighing up to 250 pounds being dropped. In addition to bombs, the British aircraft are mostly loaded with gasoline. The American-made Flying Fortress can carry huge bombs to Berlin, carry out destruction, and then safely fly back to England. But until now, this kind of giant aircraft has not been found in the skies over Berlin. For the above reasons, the British aviation personnel are undoubtedly the bravest air force soldiers in the world. Each air raid spends a very short time searching for targets in the skies over Berlin, only a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, and they must quickly return home. They must use a stopwatch to calculate the time in seconds, because if they stay too long, there is a danger of running out of gasoline and not being able to return home. Berlin knows the details of several British aircraft being forced to land a few miles off the coast of their home country due to lack of gasoline, and this statement has been confirmed by the British side after I left Germany.

### Countering Axis Conspiracy: US Adopts Strong Measures, Demands Italy Recall Naval Attaché, Seized Ships Fully Requisitioned

Washington - The United States yesterday demanded the departure of the Italian Naval Attaché from Washington because he was involved in the sabotage of Italian ships in American seaports. Secretary of State Hull sent a note to the Italian Ambassador to Washington, Goro, demanding the departure of Naval Attaché General Lais, because General Lais was not recognized by the US government as a diplomat. Hull stated that President Roosevelt had discovered that General Lais was not recognizable by the US government and had notified the State Department of this matter. Hull indicated in answering questions that the same consideration might be given to German diplomats. Hull's note to Ambassador Goro stated, "The US government has taken note of and is concerned about various facts and circumstances concerning General Lais, whose actions violate US law." Hull told reporters that the note was related to the damage suffered by Italian ships in US seaports. He indicated that Italy had not yet responded to the State Department's request of March 5 regarding the closure of the Italian consulates in Teterboro and Newark, which is also noteworthy. (United Press, 4th)

Washington - According to responsible sources here, the United States has directly rejected Germany and Italy's protests against the seizure of ships and has refused to release the ships and crews. It is reported that US Secretary of State Hull sent notes to the Axis powers last night, strongly asserting the United States' right to detain these ships. It is also reported that thirty crew members of the German ships "Memphis" and "Hammonses," which secretly left the port of Callao on Monday night, have been captured by a Peruvian cruiser and transported to Casma, 100 miles north of Callao, where they have been immediately detained. (Reuters, 4th)

Washington - The United States has requisitioned a total of 28 Italian ships, 2 German ships, and 39 Danish ships, totaling 300,000 tons. A well-known public law scholar explained the confiscation, saying that according to international law, any country enjoying belligerent rights can requisition foreign ships in its territorial waters and pay fair compensation. Although this right is often exercised by belligerent countries, it is sometimes exercised by non-belligerent countries. During the last World War, many non-belligerent countries requisitioned German ships. In 1916, Italy, although not yet at war with Germany, had already requisitioned 37 German ships. In 1916, Portugal took over 72 German ships. In 1917, Brazil confiscated 42 ships. In 1919, Peru and Spain also took the same steps, with Spain confiscating over 90 ships. Although Germany protested this action, it did not declare war on Spain and Peru. When the United States declared war in 1917, it confiscated many German ships in domestic ports, but found that the engines of many ships had been severely damaged and further ruined, some ships were sunk in the harbor, and others were set on fire and destroyed. The United States, to prevent future sabotage, passed the Espionage Act in June 1917, stipulating that whenever the President declares a national emergency, the Under Secretary of the Treasury, if he deems it in the national interest, has the right to take over foreign ships in US territorial waters. It is said that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's reception last Sunday of Axis and Danish ships anchored in US ports was based on this law. (Reuters, 4th)

Boston - Ten German crew members were charged in court yesterday with sabotage on an oil tanker seized by the United States. The defendants refused to plead. (Reuters, 4th)

Nazi Organizations - Secret Activities

Washington - Hull told reporters that he could not currently answer the question of whether the same measures would be applied to any other German officials in the United States. Sources with close contact with the development of Central and South America now have evidence that German diplomats were involved in the self-sinking of German ships in South America, proving that President J's order to take over Axis ships was indeed appropriate. A German official named Hans, under the guise of Commercial Counselor of Guatemala in Central America, is actually the propaganda chief and leader of the Fifth Column. He recently traveled to Costa Rica, and shortly thereafter, two German ships were sunk in Costa Rican ports. Local officials generally suspect Hans of being responsible for this. It was also found that Hans used checks for $20 each in San Jose, Guatemala. It was discovered that these checks were issued by Nazi organizations from the United States for anti-American activities by secret Nazi propaganda organizations in Central America and Mexico. Therefore, Hans's participation in secret work is becoming increasingly evident. (Reuters, 4th)

Colon Italian Consul Arrested and Imprisoned

London - According to news received here today, the Italian Consul in Colon, Panama Canal Zone, has been arrested and imprisoned, and his residence has also been searched. In addition, three employees of an Italian shipping company and three crew members of the seized Italian ship "Conte Picamarno" have also been arrested. The "Conte Picamarno" was one of the four major Italian ships that sailed between Shanghai and Genoa before Italy's participation in the war, with a displacement of 23,255 tons. (Reuters, 4th)

Germany Arrests American Citizens in Retaliation

Berlin - At least seven or more Americans were arrested on Wednesday and yesterday. According to Nazi sources, their crime was in retaliation for the detention of German ships in American seaports. Police indicated that they had been completely released after being detained at the Alexanderplatz Secret Police Headquarters. United Press reporter Hodelier is still being held there. The first person arrested was Dickson of New York, a representative of the Mutual Broadcasting System and part-time employee of the Chicago bureau here. All those arrested had lived in Berlin for a long time, and some were students who did not engage in any occupation. Hermann, the pastor of the American Church in Berlin, was also among those arrested but was immediately released. (Associated Press, 4th)

Germany and Italy Protest to Mexico

Mexico City - After the Mexican authorities placed the German and Italian ships anchored in Mexican ports under surveillance, the Italian envoy to Mexico recently sent a note to the Mexican Foreign Ministry protesting the matter. German envoy Boetticher also sent a note to the Mexican Foreign Ministry requesting that the sailors watching the German ships be immediately withdrawn. (Havas, 4th)

Mexico City - Those responsible for the sinking of the Italian ship "Atlantis" (2,005 tons) have been investigated according to law and may be sentenced to four years in prison and a fine of 5,000 pesos. (Reuters, 4th)

Rio de Janeiro - Police have detained the Italian cargo ship "Theresa" (6,131 tons) docked in the port, the first time Brazil has detained an Axis ship. (Reuters, 4th)

This is the second Italian ship to arrive here since the outbreak of war. The German cargo ship "Babittonga" (4,422 tons) cleared customs at the port of Santos on Wednesday and will soon set sail after loading fuel. It is reported that seven Italian ships are docked in another Brazilian port and are also actively preparing to sail. (Reuters, 4th)

Montevideo - The Uruguayan government is currently considering the issue of confiscating German and Italian ships. According to well-informed sources, the Uruguayan government will issue a statement on this matter today or tomorrow. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### US Decides to Adopt Severe Measures to Eliminate Labor Strife, National Defense Mediation Board Summoning Labor and Management to Resolve Disputes

Washington - US Secretary of War Stimson stated yesterday that the current strikes are "having a very serious impact" on national defense production. The US Army is prepared to take over the Allis-Chalmers factory in Milwaukee if necessary. Stimson said, "The government's repeated tolerance of national defense industry strikes is not a sign of weakness. In 1894, President Cleveland sent troops to Chicago to resolve the Pullman strike, which is a precedent." The National Defense Mediation Board organized a five-member mediation committee and ordered the factory authorities and union representatives to appear before the committee in Washington on Saturday to await mediation. (International News Service, 4th)

Washington - US Secretary of War Stimson indicated yesterday that the US Army might take over the Allis-Chalmers factory and have it managed by soldiers. (International News Service, 4th)

Washington - Democratic leader Congressman McCormack told the House of Representatives yesterday that President Roosevelt is expected to suppress labor strife that attempts to undermine the national defense program. McCormack stated that the President will address all the people and workers to try to prevent further obstruction of national defense work. McCormack made the above remarks because there were accusations in the House of Representatives that the President and Congress were ignoring the strike issue. (International News Service, 4th)

### Grain: Over 40,000 Bags of Rice Arrived in One Day, Another 4,200 Tons Arriving in the Evening

Foreign rice is coming in one after another. The Yongzhen Wheel, managed by the British merchant Xia Laochen Foreign Bank, directly transported rice from Rangoon to Shanghai. The news clippings have been recorded. The wheel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, carrying 17,100 bags of foreign rice, and was berthed at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. In addition, the Java Company's new postal ship Zhizha Yun plus, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also loaded over 24,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and was berthed at the Lanyan Chuan Wharf in Pudong for unloading. The Finnish wheel Tilda, managed by the Kaiping Company, directly transported 4,200 tons of foreign rice and corn from Saigon, arriving in Shanghai at 6:00 p.m. yesterday evening, and was berthed at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. (Zu)

Yesterday, the foreign rice market initially sold through stores and other shops. Seeing the continuous arrival of large quantities of sources, the future of the rice market seemed difficult to turn around for a while, so everyone watched and waited without actively buying. Floating hoarders first shed their goods at this time, and large-scale customer hoarders also found it difficult to persist, and continued to sell at lower prices. Each price then continued to drop by more than two yuan. At this time, a market announcement was made that it would be closed for one day for the Tomb Sweeping Festival today. Stores and customers were preparing to stock up, and coincidentally, they took advantage of the low price to rush out. In an instant, the sales turned over. The market tightened, and the market gradually rebounded. As a result, it only depreciated by one yuan compared to the previous market. Saigon No. 1 was 1089 yuan, No. 2 was 1056 yuan, Siam No. 1 was 1078 yuan, Huojiao was 107 yuan, Xiaojiao was 105 yuan and a half, 105 yuan, Zhongguan was 104 yuan and a half, 104 yuan, Tokyo sharpened tip was 978 yuan, special broken tip was 86 yuan, second was 812 yuan, British Hua Si Xiaojiao returned to the original package of road goods and also opened 126 yuan to 126 yuan and a half, the futures were 124 yuan and a half, half a yuan higher than the previous day. Stone trading in Saigon and other markets was even more active, and selling prices all saw gradual increases, more than half a yuan to one yuan higher than the previous market. Digestion was still active in the afternoon, and the situation continued to be strong and brisk. The total daily transaction also increased to 278,000 bags, and the original package was about 3400 tons.

Local stores' willingness to take in thick and thin japonica and other national rice was even weaker. The seller's insistence was ineffective, and the price finally fell by one or two yuan. Changbang special japonica saw 1178 yuan, high japonica 116 yuan, Kunshan japonica saw high japonica 1145 yuan, big market 1112 yuan, mid-second 1089 yuan, Qingjiao saw thin rice 109 yuan, 108 yuan, original package 112 yuan and 7 corners.

The outlet for glutinous rice was also only sporadic, but the sellers had no intention of being burdened and selling, so as a result, under their persistence, the market presented a reluctantly stable situation. Hong Kong special yuan opened at 1045 yuan, Zhongguan opened at 100 yuan, glutinous green special opening at 967 yuan, second to broken opening at 90 yuan.

### One Million Bags of Stored Flour

Yesterday, the spot market for foreign flour trended downward. This was because large quantities of Canadian flour arrived in Shanghai, and re-exported flour from Hong Kong kept pouring in, with total stocks reaching about one million bags. Buyers were also hesitant to purchase foreign flour, and sales were sluggish. Furthermore, local shops were offering flour at discounted prices, further reducing demand. Consequently, sellers were eager to sell, and the market showed increasing weakness. Today, "Flower Bird" brand Australian flour opened at $28.67, dropping to $28.45. "Golden Dragon" brand Canadian flour fell to the $28 mark, down another 5 or 6 cents from the previous day. Flour from Chinese factories was sold at a discounted price of $25, with Fuxin distributing over 5,000 bags, the remainder being sold with foreign flour as a bundle.

The wheat market was exceptionally calm yesterday. This was because the amount of domestically produced wheat in storage was very low, and the market had long been lacking supply. Therefore, factories were no longer actively searching the market for raw materials, with only Japanese stores occasionally making purchases. The market was also easing due to the decline in flour prices.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Corn Ultimately Fails to Rise

Yesterday, transactions in grains, oils, soybean cakes all decreased in volume, with prices mostly hovering around a small range. The reason was that sales at shops remained weak, and people's minds were uneasy. Furthermore, the market was closed today as usual (Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar) and Monday was Sunday, resulting in two consecutive days without trading. Therefore, the underlying trend was listless, and corn in particular was affected by the seasonal factors, with sellers eager to sell. The market price declined. How it previously rose is how it is now falling; this had long been anticipated. In short, "live in soy sauce, die in soy sauce" has proven to be true. Yesterday, the lowest price for Westside corn stored in warehouses opened at $30.06, while corn stored outside the warehouse was $30. April deliveries were at $63.50, and late March to early April deliveries were at $3.50. Dutch white corn was $32, yellow corn was $33, and spot goods from Inghua Company were $33.20. April deliveries were $62, and late March to early April deliveries were $62.50. A total of ten carloads of spot goods and twelve or thirteen carloads of futures were traded. Today, 2,240 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Returns to Stability

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates remain unchanged. The unofficial markets for British and American exchange were very quiet, with almost no fluctuations. Speculators continued to short sell May US dollar futures by four or five hundred thousand, but HSBC and other foreign banks had the capacity to absorb these sales, so the closing rate for spot British pounds was slightly higher than the previous day at 3/234375, while the US dollar remained unchanged at $5.3125. The trend in futures was similar.

Speculation Still Present

In the early morning, with London bars flat and New York silver prices and London gold prices stable, exchange rates for British and American currency showed no movement. Central Bank listed rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices at 3/234375 for British pounds and $5.3125 for US dollars, with the British pound slightly higher than the previous day by .015625, while the US dollar remained flat. After the opening, HSBC bought slightly, purchasing May US dollars at $5.3125 from other banks. If one were to settle contracts for the current month and May US dollars at that time, it would cost $5.28125. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also flat. Afterwards, speculators came to short sell 400,000 US dollar of May futures, priced at $5.3125, which were absorbed by some American banks. It was heard that Chinese banks were also conducting counter trades, but the market lacked volatility. At noon, May US dollars could be settled at $5.3125. At the close, both spot and current month British pounds were quoted at 3/234375, spot and current month US dollars were $5.3125, and May US dollars were $5.28125.

Slightly Higher British Pound, Flat US Dollar

Later in the market, speculators made a few settlements. A small volume of April US dollar contracts were traded at $5.3125. Afterwards, there was little trading activity. At the close, British pounds remained at 3/234375, US dollars at $5.3125, May British pounds at 3/21875, and May US dollars at $5.28125. As a result, the spot British pound was slightly higher than the previous day by 0.015625, while the US dollar showed no change.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Steady

Hong Kong, April 4 (Friday) Telegram: This morning, the exchange market opened steady. The spot Shanghai Exchange (申滙) alone rose by 5 jiao to $463 (previous close was $462.50), while the others showed no change. At 11:30 AM, the spot Shanghai Exchange dropped back by 5 jiao to $462.50, while the others remained unchanged.

Tianjin: British and American Currencies Both Declined

Tianjin, April 4 (Friday) Telegram: The exchange market opened soft this morning. London telegraphic transfers decreased by .03125 to 3 pence 3125. New York telegraphic transfers decreased by .0625 to $5.4375. Shanghai Exchange rose by 5 jiao to $96.25. The "Joint Notes" (聯鈔) in the unofficial market rose by 3.8 cents to $63.37.

### Gold Market Lacks Momentum, Selling Occurs at Highs

Yesterday, the unofficial market for refined gold saw mixed price movements, with only slight fluctuations. Initially, the British exchange rate was slightly higher, and market sentiment was good. The price briefly rose to $6,555, but then fell to $6,522 due to profit-taking. Afterwards, the market became even calmer. Although Xinfeng, Yongtong, Kangyong, and others continued to settle contracts, Hesheng and Hengji were also keen to cover short positions. Furthermore, Li Tai acted as an agent for a certain client to increase long positions. As a result, the closing price was still at $6,538, up $6 from the previous settlement. Approximately 17,000 to 18,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The spot market was initially firm but later weakened. Initially, Xintianbao absorbed 90 taels from Tianyuan, and Chengji 10 taels, at a premium of $200. At the same time, Chengji sold 10 taels to Fengxiang Heji, at a premium of $200. In the afternoon, due to a lack of demand for physical goods, the price was $30 lower than the previous high. It was heard that a certain silver shop sold 50 taels to Defu, at a premium of $170.

Slight Increase of Six Dollars for the Day

In the early morning, the market opened at $6,500 per bar (ten taels), and market sentiment was good. There were purchases at the listed price (opening price), pushing the price up by $18 to $6,550. Soon, Yidachengji sold off, bringing the price down to $6,538. However, Dada, Xianghe, Xinfeng, Yongtian, and others were continuously absorbing supply, pushing the price back up to $6,555. Afterwards, Xinfeng Yong stopped buying and started selling. Dafeng, Yifeng, Defu, Tongkangyong, Decheng, and others followed suit, and the exchange rate futures market hardened slightly, causing buyers to hesitate. The price gradually fell to $6,522. At noon, Chengji, Hengji, and retail investors covered short positions, slightly shifting market sentiment, and the price recovered to $6,532. The afternoon session opened at $6,536. Yida sold off in small quantities, but soon Hesheng strongly absorbed supply to cover short positions (acting as agent for Xinfeng Foreign Company). In addition, Dada and retail investors also bought, pushing the price up to $6,545. At that time, Xianghe took profits, and Xinfeng Yong also liquidated their long positions. Although Li Tai acted as an agent for a certain client to aggressively increase long positions, totaling 1,200 to 1,300 taels, demand could not keep up with supply, and the price was pushed down to $6,525. Later, Xinyuan bought aggressively, pushing the price back up to $6,540. The closing price was $6,538, resulting in an increase of $6 from the previous settlement. There was no activity in the spot market for cash shops' own-brand gold and spot standard gold.

Price of Gold Ornaments Unchanged

The selling price of gold ornaments in silver shops remained unchanged throughout the day. Datonghang and Xintonghang continued to quote $690 per tael, while the purchase price was reduced by about $40.

### Gold Coins Rise One Yuan Each

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw stable to firm prices for spot gold. The spot market was quite brisk, so both British and American gold coins rose by one point each. The price of British gold notes remained unchanged, with the market price holding steady. American gold notes initially traded at $18.55, then rose to $18.59, but subsequently fell back to $18.51.

Both Japanese and Korean gold notes trended lower, with the former falling to $1.97 and the latter falling to $1.61.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Prospects Clear

The unofficial securities market showed a rebound yesterday. It was firm in the morning, and in the afternoon news suddenly spread that a new US loan of $250 million had been successfully obtained. This was the first signal that the economic aid to China after Corley's return was about to happen. Although it had not yet materialized, it was possible. As a result, the pessimistic sentiment in the market was suddenly lifted, and the trend and prospects became clearer and more promising. Yesterday morning, Lianhe, Xie Da, Datong, Kangxin, Fuxin, and Shunchang all made purchases. However, Yuxing sold a large number of E-type bonds, while Hengkang, Renchang, Renfeng, Yongfu, and others liquidated their long positions. Therefore, the closing prices at noon were mixed. The afternoon session opened quietly, but then became bullish, with Lianyi showing extremely strong buying interest, purchasing about 300,000 to 400,000 units of A-type bonds. Xiexing Yuan purchased about 300,000 units of B and C-type bonds. Dechang, Gongmao, Xinfu, Hefeng, and Tongji also made purchases. Renfeng and Renchang sold about 400,000 units. Yongchang, Hongda, and Run yesterday all sold. United was very active in both buying and selling. The market price gradually rose in the midst of large purchases and sales. As a result, the price continued to rise by 0.2 to 0.65 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 2.8 to 2.9 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Type | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---|

For stock trading, 50 shares of the Bank of China were traded at a price of 94 yuan each. London, April 3 (Thursday) Telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were flat and sluggish, with no fluctuations in prices.

### Cotton Yarn: Bearing Three Days of Risk, Yarn Market Quiet

The yarn market remained unchanged, increasingly sluggish. This was because the actual situation showed little progress. Buyers from Hong Kong were limited, and other buyers were affected by the blockade, and their business was declining daily. Therefore, buyers' interest was weak, but raw cotton prices remained high, making it unsuitable to sell off. Therefore, everyone maintained a wait-and-see approach. Once a signal appeared, they would then take action, either buying or selling, and determining their strategy. However, some were selling "Double Horse" brand and switching to "Angel" and "Earth" brands. This was the reason for the recent firm prices of miscellaneous yarn brands. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" was $1,394, and the low price was $1,388. In the afternoon, due to the Qingming Festival tomorrow and the market being closed, there was three days of risk, and most were unwilling to take action. There were no transactions, and the asking price was around $1,393 or $1,394. Today, 1,850 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

"Double Horse" brand opened very peacefully, with the opening price at $1,392 or $1,393. Trading on the floor was not brisk. Shortly after, it rose slightly to $1,394, but buyers were scattered and lacked energy. The price hovered around this level for a long time. It was also heard that the exchange rate was quiet. Speculators said, "There's nothing to do," and their spirits were low. The market was easing, falling to $1,288. By the time the market closed, someone bought a few bales of 20-count "Angel" and "Earth" brands at higher prices, recovering slightly to close at $1,391. A statistical summary of half-day trading shows the following volumes purchased by each group:

Hong Kong/Ningbo: 40; Mainland: 120
Ningbo: 10; Traders: 4,330
Total: 4,500

### Inability to Sell Cotton Yarn at a Good Price Leads to a Surge in Cotton Purchases; Indian Cotton Market Falls as East African Cotton Wins; Shanghai Market Sees Stronger Demand for Long-Staple Wool-Like US Cotton

The spot cotton situation has become more active, with Shenxin and Yuxin factories increasing their purchases. However, the purchase intentions of the Yongan factory are not strong. As US cotton prices rise steadily, market sentiment is good, and "skin ball" transactions among traders are extremely active. Interest in cotton among the general public is increasing daily. The general opinion is that cotton inventories are low and the outlook for foreign cotton is bullish, while cotton yarn is overstocked and has limited outlets, so shifting capital from yarn to cotton to make profits is the way to go. Unfortunately, factories' enthusiasm for absorption is declining due to the inability to sell yarn at a good price and weak profits. As a result, the upward pressure is slow.

The New York cotton market was strong and advanced in the early morning due to purchases by traders and Washington, but subsequently fell slightly due to profit-taking. As a result, closing prices rose by 10 to 16 points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell because cotton merchants were short selling imported Sudanese and Egyptian cotton, then recovered due to buyer support. But most importantly, the market fell again due to the British victory in the African war, which would lead to a large amount of African cotton such as Egyptian and Sudanese cotton being imported. Yesterday's closing prices fell by 1 to 3 rupees. Forecasts predict that today's opening will rise slightly by 1.5 rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has seen factory and trader competition due to over 4,000 bales of Brazilian cotton arriving at the end of last month, and the market has been surging. The demand for long-staple wool-like US cotton of fine-count raw material is particularly strong. It is expected that as the situation in all regions is favorable, there will be a more active cotton market.

### Piece Goods: Large Quantities of Cloth Shipped to Hong Kong

The factory cloth market continued to be firm yesterday. Transactions among traders and actual demand in the local market remained active. However, only the Cantonese and Hong Kong buyers can get through, and their purchases were the most enthusiastic. Today, 2,160 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong. White goods from the sales disk, such as Dapeng fine cloth, continued to be sought after by Jinghua, Huafeng and other factories, rising by 5 jiao alone. Other grades of fine cloth and twill were inferior, with flat opening prices. Yihe's grades of coarse cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, but were still cheaper than the market price. Dark-colored fine yarn fabrics, melton, and serge rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in the local market. Cantonese and Hong Kong buyers purchased more than 300 pieces of goods such as Sanyang serge, Huafeng blue cloth, and Daxin-colored twill.

The Dongbu (Eastern Cloth) market was stable. White goods rose slightly due to weak actual sales, but the increases quickly failed, with little change. The highest selling price for Longtou fine cloth was $49.75, the lowest was $49.50, and the closing transaction price was $49.60. The price of Sijunzi serge continued to rise by 5 li, to $1.45.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Ease

Yesterday, the sugar market, after several days of large price increases, had gradually built up inventories, and many were inclined to sell, so prices continued to ease. The association's quoted prices for spot goods were: $87.95 to $87.50 for 24-grade coarse white sugar stored outside the warehouse, down 8 jiao. Futures for April 10 delivery were initially firm, at $89 to $88.50, but then eased to $88.20, $87.80, and $87.60, down about one yuan. Futures for April 20 delivery opened at $90, then went to $89.50, $89, and $88.60, down 9 jiao. Dutch red sugar was $68.50, small triangle. Taikoo granulated sugar B mark was $89.60 and $89.50, unchanged. DY mark was $84, small four corners. HX mark was $83.20, small two corners. Yesterday, 24,000 bags of sugar arrived from the Netherlands.

### Northern and Southern Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branch Market Sees Rise

Due to gradually decreasing stocks of orchid bamboo branches, the market trend has slightly shifted lower. Listed prices have risen by $5, and market prices have also increased accordingly. However, the sales of black leaf branches remain weak. Although the stock is scarce, it remains sluggish.

### Seafood: Shrimp Roe Sees Both Scarcity of Arrivals and Sales

The arrival of shrimp roe has been scarce recently, but sales from all regions are also sluggish, so the market trend is very calm. The price of "Chaobian" tail is relatively high, currently selling for $650, "Tianbian" tail is $430, and "Yuan Dong" tail is $450.

### Coal: Tongdeli White Coal Increases Rapidly

The market for Tongdeli white coal is booming, and the price of the goods continues to rise. Because customer demand continues to be strong, and traders' stocks are gradually depleted, market participants are holding back from selling, and the unofficial price is increasing rapidly. Yesterday, Tongdeli No. 1 and No. 2 lump coal was quoted at $380, for old orders, warehouse rent is excluded. The prices of the shops in this street also rose in unison with the tide.

### Metals: Huisi Iron Sales in This Street are Very Active

Two hundred-pound Huisi iron from the new and old steel mills, because there is not much circulating goods in the market, and the overseas sources of supply is cut off, so this street's can factories, toy factories, printing factories, biscuit factories, and traders unloading are all very active. The number of transactions every day is often over a hundred boxes. The market participants holding goods are energetic, and the market is rising with prices tightening. The price is about 30-40 points higher than before, and now selling about $400 per box. The price increase of small strip iron, blue lead double-connected boards, and blue lead Huisi iron, are also alarming. Previously, the market price of plain white iron sheets once dropped to $15-16 per sheet due to hoarders selling off, but yesterday, because of slight movements in customer demand and factory sales, the price rose again, with a asking price of $21-22 per sheet.

### Changes to the Number of Directors Must Go Through Legal Procedures; The Consular Body Will Be Notified After the General Meeting, and Then Reported to the Governments of Various Countries for Approval

Yesterday morning (the 4th), an official told a Western newspaper reporter that there might be some difficulties in seeking approval from the countries that signed treaties with China and the Chinese government for the proposed change in the number of directors of the Municipal Council, but this would ultimately have no impact on the Municipal Council. It is reported that the change in the number of directors will seek the approval of the entire consular body, not the approval of individual consuls. All twelve consuls of the consular body, except for Japan, recognize the Chongqing government as the legitimate government of China.

Too Early to Make a Final Decision

The official also confirmed that the Consuls General of Britain, the United States, and Japan are currently drafting a proposal to change the number of directors, which will be presented as a resolution at the special taxpayers' meeting on April 17. It is said that if the taxpayers of the Public Concession approve this change, the leader of the consular body will be notified, and then a report will be submitted to the senior representatives of the countries that signed treaties with China and the Chongqing government. When asked if the change in the number of directors could be approved, the official replied that it was too early to tell and that there might be unexpected developments, so it was impossible to say for sure.

The Question of Additional Directors

At the same time, all sectors of the city are still discussing the results of this year's Municipal Council election. In addition to the Chinese, British, American, and Japanese directors, there is a possibility of adding directors of other nationalities. The expatriate groups with fewer residents in Shanghai have already selected their ideal candidates for additional directors. However, except for the American expatriates who recommended two candidates in February, other expatriates have not yet definitively determined candidates.

The Russian Expatriate Association Engages in the Election

The Russian Expatriate Association of this city held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss a proposal to be submitted to the consular body, requesting the addition of a Russian director to the Municipal Council. Yesterday morning, various Russian-language newspapers reported on this proposal with great fanfare, advocating for the achievement of their goal. The reason they gave was that there are a large number of Russian expatriates in Shanghai, and the property and interests they own are also increasing daily, so they demand that they should have one or two director seats in the Municipal Council. The Russian expatriates admit that the White Russians in Shanghai do not have a consul, so there will be difficulties in the election. However, we believe that most of the Russian expatriates reside in the French Concession and claim that the interests of the Russian expatriates in the Public Concession are greater than those of other expatriates who currently do not have a director seat in the Municipal Council. According to Ivanov, the chairman of the Russian Expatriate Association, the Russian expatriates in this city are currently electing a candidate to participate in the election of "other nationality" directors of the Municipal Council.

### Citywide Rice Stockpile of 1.6 Million Bags

The Rice Industry Association's 105th survey of rice stocks in Chinese and foreign warehouses (from last Thursday to this Thursday) has been completed. The citywide (including Pudong, Hongkou, and the central district) total reached 849,197 bags in more than 60 rice warehouses, an increase of 7,922 bags from the previous period. Roosevelt had the most, with 73,741 bags. The number of rice door-to-door sales and residents hoarding is estimated to reach more than 600,000 bags. Therefore, the total amount of rice stored in the city is still more than 1.6 million bags. Assuming a daily consumption of 10,000 bags, the rice stock is sufficient for the city's 4 million Chinese and foreign residents for six months.

Impersonating Detectives Extort Rice Shops

On the afternoon of the first of this month at 3 PM, Yin Yuzhang, who impersonated a detective from the Political Department of the Public Concession, suddenly arrived at the Yucheng Rice Shop at 299 Guangxi Road, claiming that the Saigon rice sold by the shop exceeded the price limit, and then extorted 100 yuan of national currency. Afterwards, Mao Guodou, a detective from the Political Department, learned of the incident and went to the shop to investigate with detectives Li Haifeng and Li Bijun. The facts were verified, and they immediately found out Yin Yuzhang's formal address. On the morning of the 3rd, they lured him to the corner of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road and arrested him. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, he was sent to the court by the Central Police Station for prosecution.

### Pihan Shelter Closing at the End of the Month

The Yan Family Residence Pihan Shelter of the Cilian Association, which houses more than 1,000 impoverished people, is scheduled to close at the end of this month. The impoverished people in the shelter have made hundreds of mops and hundreds of straw sandals, which are urgently waiting to be sold. If anyone needs them, they can contact the association's office at 35 Yunnan Road, Renji Shantang.

### French Concession Authorities Eager for Residents to Reduce Electricity Consumption; Special Electricity Restriction Committee Has Been Formed; Diesel Shortage at Power Company, Difficulties

Regarding the three fundamental principles of reducing electricity consumption in the French Concession, which were mentioned in yesterday's newspaper, it is learned that the French Concession authorities have formed a special Electricity Restriction Committee, whose members are as follows:

(Chairman) French Consul Dufour

(Committee Members) Bai Yi, Director of the Municipal Council; Pu Gong, Chief Engineer of the Municipal Council; Sa Li, Deputy Director of the Police Department; Favreli, Manager of the French Water and Electricity Company; Xu Le, Zhao Zhiyou, Laban'er, Sang Qie.

The committee recently held a meeting at the Municipal Council. At the meeting, Favreli, the manager of the water and electricity company, reported on the difficulties the company was facing, saying that the company needed 2,100 tons of diesel per month, but the oil company only agreed to supply 1,500 tons per month in March and April, and the quantity to be supplied in the future could not be guaranteed. The water and electricity company currently has 5,200 tons of oil in stock, which is only enough for March. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a practical electricity reduction plan, which will be implemented according to the urgency. The biggest electricity consumers in the concession are the factories, but industry has a great impact on social problems, so the amount used will be protected as much as possible within the possible range. Electricity consumption for electric heating, road signs, neon lights, etc. must be saved. Residents should also understand the company's situation and voluntarily reduce their electricity consumption to overcome the difficulties. It is heard that the Electricity Restriction Committee is scheduled to hold another meeting next Thursday.

The current monthly electricity consumption in the French Concession is as follows:

Residents 2,656,000 KWH
Factories 3,088,600 KWH
Electric Heating 385,000 KWH

National Tomb Sweeping Day

### Solemn Silent Tribute: Remembering the Heroic Souls Who Defended the Nation

Today is National Tomb Sweeping Day (also known as the abolished lunar Qingming Festival). The government previously issued an explicit order to commemorate ancestors and martyrs on this date. People from all walks of life in this city, with resolute and solemn spirits, are preparing to go to various public cemeteries in the concessions to pay respects to deceased family members. They will also uniformly insert willow branches and hang peach charms to summon the heroic souls who were loyal and defended the nation. Originally, it was planned to go to the Tomb of the Unknown Heroes in Miaohang and the Tomb of Martyrs Mengzhou in Jiangwan for commemoration, but due to the special circumstances, it was decided to suspend the activity as usual. Instead, a solemn silent tribute will be held for the fallen soldiers who fought to resist the Japanese and defend the nation. We vow to inherit the unfinished legacy of the martyrs, to move forward in unity in our respective national duties, and strive for the final victory of the nation.

Slaughterhouse Pig Butchers Strike: A Sudden Labor Dispute; Union Collects Pig Bristles; Union Directors Oppose and Get Beaten

There are over sixty slaughterhouses in the French Concession of this city, divided into Jiangyin, Suzhou, and local groups, employing over two hundred pig butchers. Recently, Chen Jinhai, a director of the industry association, opposed the union's collection of pig bristles for three days as union funds (previously, the pig bristles belonged to both labor and management). This caused dissatisfaction among the workers. On the afternoon of the 3rd, at 8:45 PM, as Chen was going from his home to the company office, he was ambushed by over twenty workers at the entrance of the company on Min Ti Ni Yin Road and severely beaten. Police officers arrived and arrested two workers involved in the incident and detained them at the police station. An ambulance was called to take Chen to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The police also filed charges yesterday. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon (the 4th), the workers suddenly went on strike, causing the slaughterhouse operations to come to a complete halt. The workers suddenly announced the strike without stating any reasons before or after the event. It is only known that the purpose of this strike is to demand that the police release the two arrested workers.

Tailor Strike: Resolution Reached

Hundreds of garment workers in Western-style clothing stores on Xiafei Road, Hubei Road, Sichuan Road, and other areas, noting that the price of rice in the city has exceeded one hundred yuan (according to the labor-management agreement signed on October 28th of last year, if the price of Xian rice (No. 2) exceeds one hundred yuan, wages would be adjusted), demanded that management improve their compensation. Due to significant differences in opinion between the two sides, a strike was implemented starting on the 28th. It is now known that the strike was resolved the night before last through mediation by the Public Concession 工部局 Political Department. Except for Xiafei Road, where the management representative was absent, labor and management in Hubei Road, Sichuan Road, and other areas have agreed to sign an agreement with the following measures: (1) Wage increases will be as follows: (A) Those with current wages of four yuan or less will receive a 40% increase. (B) Those with current wages of eight yuan or less will receive a 34% increase. (C) Those with current wages above eight yuan will uniformly receive a 30% increase. (D) Long-term tailors will receive a 32% increase based on their current wages. (2) The above rates are for long robes. Other wages for summer clothing, overcoats, vests, and outwork foremen will be increased according to the same percentage as the long robes. For example, if the wage for long robes is increased by 30%, all other wages will also be increased by 30%. (3) This agreement will be adjusted again when the price of rice (No. 2 Xian rice) rises to 150 yuan, with a further 20% increase based on the new wage. Subsequently, for every 50 yuan increase in the price of rice, there will be another 20% increase based on the new wage. For example, if the current wage is six yuan, an additional 2.04 yuan will be added. If the price of rice exceeds 150 yuan, an additional 1.608 yuan will be added, for a total of 9.648 yuan. This will continue proportionally.

Postal Workers' Demands: Two Proposed Solutions

Due to rising prices, postal workers in this city have twice requested a raise from the Bureau chief. The bureau has now telegraphed the headquarters to request a response within three days. It is reported that the postal workers have proposed two solutions for the pay increase: First, the Postal Workers' Union is requesting a raise of 100 yuan per person. Second, the Postal Employees' Union is requesting a 250% increase for those with monthly salaries below 100 yuan, a 200% increase for those with monthly salaries between 100 and 200 yuan, and a 150% increase for those with salaries above 200 yuan.

Some Scale Shops Have Resumed Work

There are over forty weighing instrument businesses (i.e., scale shops). The employees, feeling that their salaries were too low, requested a 60% increase in wages from the shop owners, which was not accepted, and they went on strike. It is learned that over thirty businesses have accepted the employees' requests and have moderately increased their wages. However, over ten businesses have not accepted the requests and are currently closed.

Shoe Workers Strike and Cause Disturbances

Since the 1st of this month, due to soaring costs and increased prices, the shoe industry's labor force, feeling that the 20% allowance and 20% rice subsidy increased in January of this year were insufficient to maintain their livelihood, requested management on the 1st of this month to further increase the allowance. This request was not met, and some shoe store workers began a strike on the 2nd. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, thirty striking workers went to shoe stores in the Xin Zha District that were still open and demanded that the workers join the strike. After hearing this, the police, fearing it would disrupt public order, arrested thirteen of the striking workers.

### Authorities Propose Remedies for Unequal Taxation: Subcommittee Prepares Report to be Submitted to the Annual Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting for Discussion

The 工部局 previously established a subcommittee to study the inequalities of the tax system and to propose remedial measures. The initial members of the committee were F. Cranston, J. Johns, Sun Ruihuang, Mei Han, and Okamoto. Later, E. Ising, a representative of the Property Owners' Association, was added as a member. The discussions have now been completed, and two reports have been submitted. One report was agreed upon by five members, and the other was submitted independently by Mr. Ising. Both reports were submitted for discussion at a special meeting of the 工部局 Board of Directors yesterday (the 4th). As a result, it was decided to submit the former report to this year's Annual Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting for discussion. The contents are as follows:

Inequalities in House Tax: It has been found that the house tax paid by lessees of properties in the Public Concession and the so-called "outside road area" has been based primarily on the actual rent paid in the past and present. On the other hand, the house tax paid by owner-occupiers of properties is based on the 工部局's valuation. This valuation is theoretically determined by referring to the rent paid by tenants for similar properties. When there is a change in rental value, the assessed value of owner-occupied properties must be adjusted sooner or later to match the change in rental value.

The 工部局's current tax system has been considered fair to all taxpayers. If the situation in this city were the same as in the past, there would be no shortcomings in this tax system. However, since the Battle of Shanghai, the situation has been abnormal, causing the previously satisfactory tax system to become unequal, and remedies should be found immediately. This inequality can be roughly divided into (1) inequality among property lessees, (2) inequality between property lessees and owner-occupiers, and (3) inequality arising from the mixed calculation of taxes.

Protected and Unprotected: Regarding the first point, in order to thoroughly study the inequality among property lessees, tenants should first be divided into two categories: protected tenants and unprotected tenants. A "protected tenant" is one who is protected by Chinese civil law and cannot be evicted or have their rent increased without a court ruling. In addition, tenants who have long-term lease agreements are similarly protected. According to the provisions of Chinese civil law, as interpreted by Chinese courts, for leases calculated on a monthly basis or without a lease agreement, the landlord may not order them to move unless they intend to take back the property for their own use or demolish and rebuild it. Furthermore, they may not increase the rent without a court ruling. Therefore, since 1937, it has been very difficult for landlords to obtain permission to increase rents, and even those who have been approved have been limited to an increase of 20% or less. According to accurate estimates, protected tenants account for approximately 80% of all tenants in Shanghai. As for the general unprotected tenants, they are not subject to Chinese law and did not have long-term lease agreements before the war.

Because tenants enjoy the benefits of protection, their rent either remains the same as before the war or has increased by only 20%. On the other hand, general unprotected tenants have no choice but to obey the landlord's wishes, and as a result, their house tax is based on frequently increasing rents. However, the house tax paid by protected tenants is still based on pre-war rent or limited increases.

Different Market Conditions Before and After the War: Although Chinese civil law is not newly promulgated, the tax system was already feeling somewhat unequal during the period before the war in 1937. The reason for this is that there was an open market for leased properties before the war, and rents had a normal and natural level. For example, in the spring of 1937, if a landlord intended to increase the rent and the tenant considered the increase unreasonable, the tenant could move to another property. At that time, the situation for protected tenants was not as good as it is today. From 1934 to 1935, rents tended to fall, and by the spring of 1937, they had not fully recovered to the levels of 1933. After the Battle of Shanghai, Shanghai and its suburbs suffered widespread devastation, resulting in overcrowding in the concessions and their jurisdictional areas. Thus, the situation changed, and it became difficult for unprotected tenants to find better accommodation due to rent increases. The open market for properties disappeared, and the disparity in the amount of rent paid by the two types of tenants became increasingly severe, resulting in unequal tax payments.

Reassessment Not Yet Completed: Under the 工部局's current tax system, the house tax paid by the two types of tenants will inevitably be unequal due to rising or falling rents. Recognizing this, the 工部局 established a reassessment committee at the beginning of last year to revalue owner-occupied properties. For owner-occupied commercial and industrial buildings, the valuation as of June 30, 1937, was used to determine the current value, and then an additional 20% was added for tax purposes. The additional 10% was considered to be the average increase in rent since 1937. At the same time, the Tax Bureau also revalued the value of owner-occupied residential buildings based on the above standards.

Although the committee worked hard to speed up the work, it was unable to complete the reassessment of all owner-occupied houses by the end of last year. Since January of this year, house tax has been levied on those houses that have been reassessed based on their newly estimated value. All houses that have not been reassessed will wait for reassessment. This measure will reduce the inequality between rented houses and owner-occupied houses that have already been reassessed. However, on the other hand, it will create inequality between owner-occupied houses that have been reassessed and those that have not been reassessed. The committee's valuation work is expected to be completed this autumn, and the latter inequality mentioned above may not be completely eliminated before this autumn. (To be continued)

### Happy Children's Day

Yesterday was Children's Day, and children all over the city were excited and celebrated the holiday. School teachers and parents led the children to parks for outings. The Sino-German Hospital also held a children's health competition, which was unprecedented. (Top picture) Children at the Sino-German Hospital perform a human pyramid.

### Children's Day Outing

— Wei

Children's Day is a day of liberation for children, and they should be allowed to play and have fun. The older children went to the Dumi Theater in groups with their schools in the morning to watch a movie. In the afternoon, I decided to take them to the park for an outing. I think it's so silly for children to be led by their teachers to play in the park! It's really too much trouble for teachers to take care of children, and children can't play as they please because they are restricted by the group. When I saw several children who had lost their groups crying in confusion because they couldn't find their companions and teachers, I thought about how distressed their teachers would be to lose a child!

Because the French Park is very close to home, the children usually go there to play by themselves, so I decided to go to a park that was farther away so they could feel like they were on a trip.

We set off at 1:30 PM after lunch. After waiting for four buses, we finally squeezed onto the fifth bus. We got off at the outer end of Avenue Edward VII. The older child asked me what the bronze statue standing at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII was. I told him that it was the Peace Memorial Tower of the First World War. The winged female figure is called the Goddess of Peace, but the Goddess of Peace did not deter those crazy invaders, and now the whole world is at war again!

Walking along the Huangpu River, we unknowingly reached the Bund Park. The younger child was very interested in the big and small boats in the Huangpu River. He loved the white speedboat that was speeding through the waves. Maybe he thought it was the toy speedboat he played with in a basin full of water.

When we entered the Bund Park, there were not many visitors. The grass all showed a haggard and withered color. A large area of grass along the mouth of the Suzhou River was prohibited from being trampled on. Except for some green trees and flowers along the road, half of the park was desolate and lifeless. We sat on a bench along the river for a while. The old clock at the Customs House was striking two, and the new clock should be three o'clock, so we decided to leave and go to Zhaofeng Garden.

In front of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road, we boarded the front row of the upper level of Bus Route 1, and Jidong sent us to the far west of Zhaofeng Garden. In front of the park gate, there were slogans "Benefit the Country and Benefit the People," and tourists and vendors were playing a noisy metropolitan melody.

As soon as we walked in, the park was full of groups of people. The children were like small birds out of their cages, rushing to the grass. We sat on the grass and ate the snacks we brought, and then strolled around as we pleased.

Groups of children were led by their teachers and played various games on the grass, or chased each other under the bushes. Rubber balls fell and rose in the air like shooting stars, small sails floated in the river, and small fish and tadpoles were caught by the pond. The whole park was a world of children.

We walked towards the east, crossed the small bridge over the pond, and walked among the trees on the earthen mound. Sometimes we ran, sometimes we walked slowly, crossed the vast and flat green grass, and went deep into the woods in the northwest corner, turning and winding until we reached a place where various flowers and plants were planted. There were flowers of various colors, light brown maple leaves, and pear blossoms like a sea of snow, and our eyes were full of bright colors. It was as if we had become the four characters in "The Wizard of Oz." Let nine-year-old Ming'er play Dorothy, six-year-old Lin'er, who is brave but not able to think, can be called the Scarecrow, fourteen-year-old Zhong'er, who has a relatively mild temperament but doesn't seem to have a good memory, can temporarily play the Tin Man, and then I should play this docile Lion. We don't need to find the old doctor in the Emerald City.

We were quite tired from walking, so we rested in the shade of the trees, and then passed the tall earthen mound planted with flowers on the west side and arrived at the ancestral temple with the yellow walls. We saw two enchanting women taking pictures of a man by the wall with the dragon painted on the back door, making strange movements. I couldn't bear to look at it again, so I walked straight to the front door, took a deep breath on the thick and soft grass under the tree, and walked out of the park gate.

### Preventing Car Horn Noise: Promotion Week to be Held Next Month; Late-Night Disturbances Extremely Annoying; Police Department Decides to Adopt Adjustment Methods

There are many cars in this city, and the sound of their horns is endless on the streets. It is not very annoying during the day, but at night, the sound is deafening, disturbing people's sleep. Especially in summer, when citizens often sleep with their windows open, they are startled awake by the sudden sound of horns, which is very distressing.

Anti-Horn Noise Disturbance Campaign: Recognizing this, the 工部局 Police Department will cooperate with the French Concession Police Department in May to launch a campaign to prevent horn noise disturbance, following the "Safety First" campaign, which has been quite successful. It will last for one week. If the desired results are achieved, then people will be able to sleep at night without being disturbed by the sound of horns.

Cooperation and Extensive Promotion: In order to extensively launch this campaign, the Public Concession police authorities will cooperate with other relevant authorities in the city. During the promotion week, extensive publicity will be used to urge car owners, drivers, and visiting car drivers to help eliminate the horn noise that disturbs good dreams. In this new campaign, the methods of promoting the "Safety First" campaign will be followed, using radio, leaflets, banners, and speeches for publicity.

Practical Demonstration of Mechanical Devices: In previous years, the police authorities have warned against honking car horns unnecessarily, but it has had little effect. Therefore, it is hoped that mechanical devices will be demonstrated in this campaign to reduce the sound of horns to a minimum. It is heard that the Police Department will adjust the sound waves of horns for private cars and taxis free of charge in order to promote the use of sound-reducing devices. A certain police officer from the Police Department Traffic Department yesterday demonstrated to reporters the method of using this device to reduce the sound of horns.

Liu Yinshi (45 years old), a woman from Jiangbei, recently lost her husband and was left with two children. Unable to make a living, at about 1:00 AM on the 4th, she took advantage of the night and the absence of pedestrians to sneak into the wasteland at Tokyo Road and Binlang Road, where she opened two newly buried coffins and stripped seven pieces of clothing worth over 20 yuan. She wrapped them in a bundle and planned to pawn them at a pawnshop, but she was discovered by Chinese police officer No. 1032, Sandaotou, and Chinese detective Xia Shutang of the Gordon Road Police Station on the way.

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern: I have just returned from another city. A friend told me that your newspaper published a news item on the first of this month about counterfeit Black Man Toothpaste, which stated that Shen Shanchang of Shanghai Chemical Company, in collusion with the owner of Shanghai Tube Factory, manufactured inferior toothpaste. The part about me is obviously inconsistent with the facts. Fortunately, the original document is still there and can be reviewed. Moreover, my factory has been implicated for no reason and has filed an appeal against the fine. Right and wrong are subject to public judgment. It is difficult to accept misinformation that damages years of reputation. I hereby request that you correct the matter. Please investigate and handle it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Shen Zhaoji. April 4, Year 30.

### Beware of the Fifth Column

— Wu Su

Recently, there has been a popular new term called "Fifth Column". Since Germany's great victory in Europe, the "Fifth Column" has become even more famous. Especially in the United States, the newspapers and magazines are always full of stories about the Fifth Column. The Fifth Column has almost made everyone panic.

In fact, the Fifth Column does not only exist internationally, nor only in military and political affairs; it can exist in you, in me, and in him, anytime and anywhere.

What is your Fifth Column? Your bad habits are your First Column. Being lazy today, doing a few minutes less work; being presumptuous today, losing your temper a few more times, thinking a few more bad thoughts, lingering in bad environments for a while, doing one more thing that makes your conscience uneasy, it may seem to have nothing to do with it at first, but you have invisibly arranged the Fifth Column in your own character.

If you continue to perfunctorily like this, without paying attention to and correcting it, one day, your Fifth Column will intensify its destructive work on you. At that time, you will lose your job, you will get sick, you will fall into a state of being unable to save yourself; by then, it will be too late to regret.

So, you must beware of the Fifth Column!

### My Wild Children

— A Friend of Wild Children

Wild children, somewhat annoying! Broken clothes, dirty hands and faces, rough movements, vulgar language; scabies, mange, worms covering the whole body. Children from noble families, stay away, it's terrible to get close. Not only will they adopt rough habits, but they will also spread malignant diseases. So parents warn their children not to approach the little rascals and not to play with wild children. This is correct. But can simply locking up your own children and not letting them come into contact with wild children guarantee that the wildness of wild children will not affect the children at home? Please look further: the villains today are mostly the wild children of the past, and the parents who can protect their children today are the children from home in the past; if there are more villains, will life be good? Will the country be decent? From this point of view, it is not enough to simply isolate your own children from wild children, unless all wild children are transformed into home children can you rest assured. Can wild children also be transformed into home children? It depends on the determination of the general public.

I have been friends with some wild children for two years, and I feel that their nature is not very annoying. The environment forces them to do all kinds of bad behaviors. After a long time, bad habits are hard to change, and it seems that their nature is inferior. I compare them to a piece of white cloth splashed with dirt. If you wait until it dries for a long time before washing it, it won't be clean for a while. People mistakenly think that it cannot be washed clean, so they just give up. However, if it can be washed with bleach after coating, you can bleach it as white as snow, no matter what color it is. If wild children are willing to undergo appropriate education, no matter how annoying they are, they can become lovable. Although I can't guarantee it as definitely as one plus one equals two, at least the experience of the past few years tells me so.

I remember a few years ago I saw an anecdote about a general in a certain newspaper. The general once gave a speech to people, and the first sentence was: "China has me, and it will never perish." The audience was very surprised, how could he be so exaggerated, could he save China alone? Then the general said: "Everyone has a 'me', and 400 million people in China have 400 million 'me's. Is it not useful to gather 400 million 'me's?" Applause like thunder roared from the audience.

I dare not imitate the general's tone, and it is inevitable to be ridiculed for inappropriate analogy when applied to the issue of wild children. But if every adult can recognize the unattended wild children as "my children", treat wild children with the attitude of "my children", save wild children, and transform wild children, not only will wild children be able to escape the water and fire and ascend to the hall, but home children will also be able to avoid the crisis of being invaded in the future. Wise parents who love their children, please think twice.

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association is carrying out the work of rescuing wild children. The homeless children who have been educated in the orphanage have changed their appearance and jumped out of hell and into the human world. They love to read, are unwilling to work, are polite, and have spirit. All the ladies who have visited them nod and praise them, thinking that they are not waste, but children with a future, but the manpower and financial resources of the association are weak and cannot universally save them, so they have launched a campaign to solicit "Friends of Suffering Children". It is hoped that happy compatriots will actively participate and use the love of the public as their merciful boat. (The office of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association is located at Room 419, 4th Floor, No. 169 Yuanmingyuan Road.)

### Father is Our Friend

— Mo Zi

My father, in his fifties, has graying temples, but he has a young heart.

Like many people who cannot get rid of the constraints given to them by the environment, my father was born in a stubborn feudal family, and from then on developed a cautious and humble character. For more than fifty years, he has seen many changes in the world and experienced many vicissitudes, but he still has a conscience that has not gone along with the world, and exchanges his labor for living materials. Although my father sometimes does not agree with the world, he does not express an attitude of disgust towards them. He is still satisfied with his own land and lives his life optimistically.

People generally use strict to represent the attitude of fathers towards their children, but these two words are not suitable for us. Especially in recent years, my brother and I have gradually grown up and know more and more. We often talk and laugh arbitrarily, discuss world affairs, and criticize people. When he is happy, my father often says:

"We don't seem like father and son anymore, we are friends, haha we are friends."

My father has read many ancient books and classics, but he is also willing to accept new knowledge. Recently, he has read many books that are believed by young people of the era and are often criticized by the older generation or people with stubborn ideas. He read them and praised them. He would ask us about many new terms that he discovered. We would explain them in detail if we knew them. He was very happy to hear them and often said:

"Now you know more than me. In the past, young people followed the elderly, but now the elderly have to follow the young people."

Often many children grow up and become more and more estranged from their parents. But we are able to get extraordinarily close. While not forgetting the struggle for the future, we still maintain the warmth of the family. I often celebrate this happiness.

My father spent his entire middle age immersed in the muddy political tides of the past two decades. He neither got promoted nor got rich, but this did not make them regret it in the slightest. What he often regretted was not taking the opportunity to read more books when he was free, and the 5,000 books lost after the war. In the past two years, he has changed his career to teaching. The interest brought by the new profession did not make him think that teaching was a very hard job. Students like to attend his classes, saying that he often smiles and makes them happy. Once I asked one of her classmates, saying:

"You are happier in his class than other teachers, are you afraid of him?" Her answer was very thoughtful:

"Although there is no fear, there is always respect." I feel that the reason why we can have no gap with our father and will not be presumptuous, these two sentences are equally pertinent.

Speaking of our future, he hopes that we can be self-reliant, but does not blame us for rich support. He plans to return to his hometown in the future and live a simple and quiet life. I sometimes say to him:

"Father, you have been a good person for decades, and you still have a young heart. You can still do a vigorous job like young people, maybe you will achieve even greater things..." He often replaces his answer with a smile. , I don’t know if he agrees? Or show us to work hard.

Now, my father is sleeping peacefully after a day's work. Under the light, I looked at his kind face and white hair, and my heart was filled with gratitude. I can only repay him by working hard for my own future and wishing him eternal health and youth.

(6) Love's Offspring

But at the time, Qiu Haitang did not think of this matter at all, so he did not deeply imprint Xiangqi's words in his mind.

A week later, he could no longer sit still in Beijing. After the three-day play agreed upon at Hualeyuan was over, he told Yuan Shaowen, Zhao Si, and others that Liu Yuhua had recently returned from the south and was sick at her home in Xianghe. He had received a telegram asking him to go there once, so he had to go out for three or four days. Others believed this lie, but he couldn't fool Rongkui; he thought that he and the Third Boss were almost always together. In these few days, he had never seen a telegram for him.

"There must be something going on here!" When he sent Qiu Haitang out the door, he couldn't help but think to himself.

Qiu Haitang never expected that this kid would be so suspicious. When he got on the train, he couldn't wait to get to Tianjin immediately. However, the train was not made by him after all, nor was it opened for him alone. Before the scheduled time, he could only sit in the carriage and feel bored.

"I forgot to ask Yuan Shaowen when he also plans to go to Tianjin." While sitting bored, he realized that he had not taken this into account before he set off. But when he thought about it again, he felt relieved. First, he thought that no matter what day Lao Yuan set off from Beijing, Xiangqi should have some news there. Second, he thought that he would only be walking around in the Grain and Rice Street and would not go to Yuan's house, so they would never bump into each other.

But when he saw Xiangqi, he realized that some of his expectations were wrong.

"His temper is too strange. He never notifies me before coming." Xiangqi was still living at her home in Grain and Rice Street, just like seven or eight days ago. Therefore, Qiu Haitang did not need to go through the formalities of writing a letter to make an appointment and saw her immediately. After Qiu Haitang asked about Yuan Baofan's news, she frowned and said: "That's why I advised you in the second letter to come to Tianjin less often. Anyway, our hearts are forever tied together, what does it matter if our bodies are a little distant...!"

Xiangqi was still wearing a very simple cloth dress today, but her hair was adorned with a dark red chrysanthemum that was not yet fully bloomed, which seemed to add another touch of charm. (73)

### "Opopanax"

— Mo Ye

This is a play adapted from the famous Russian work "Di Si Niang". In the tide of fashion films, it is significantly superior to those "Crying and Laughing Fate" type of films; although the development and formation of the theme is still inseparable from personal affairs of children, breaking free from the category of love.

The adaptation of "Opopanax" into Chinese, the spirit and mood of the whole play can maintain the original style; the division of scenes is also very concise, and even the transitional scenes do not feel how trivial, this is the brilliant stroke of the adapter. It can also grab the audience with danger and tension everywhere, which is where it succeeds.

Naturally, there are still many places worth discussing, such as the fact that it is not suitable for realistic China, the story renders such a strong coincidence, and the disconnection between the characters' personalities and real life. These can be said to have room for improvement.

The theme must be prominent in the subject matter, which is no different from the importance of studying hard. The theme of "Opopanax" is quite commendable, anti-warlord and evil forces grow, the whole play also exposes the darkness of warlord politics in many scenes, the innocent people are brutally killed, and the cruelty of the shameless is revealed to the audience at the beginning of the film. Then, Jin Dashuai's fierceness and the ugly faces of the adjutants are like a mirror, thoroughly shaping the image in front of the audience.

The director seems to be better than his previous work - "Xue Yan Niang". There is atmosphere, every scene is very tense, and it does not fall into slackness, this is his only successful place.

There is such a bad tendency in domestic films, the splicing of film is too sloppy, and even many directors cannot understand why it should be spliced. In fact, the stagnation of the lens is half due to the excessive length of the film, which distracts the audience's attention. "Opopanax" seems to have tried to correct this shortcoming, and the pace is very reasonable. Indeed, the scene of Luo Jing's private visit to Bai Lizhu, if played with a quiet melody, can increase the beauty of the mood, and it will also be of great help to the air.

Huang He's appearance in a formal young male role is still the first time on the screen. Undoubtedly, he still cannot wash away the excessive movements on the stage. Whether it is facial expression or inner expression, you can see that he is full of anger.

Ying Yin's most successful and most commendable place is the presentation of the characters' inner emotions. Yao Yu Chan is a person who has experienced a lot of hardships. She loves her cousin Luo Jing with all her heart, and wants to get some fun in life from this. When she knows that her sweetheart is in love with another person, and that person is her benefactor; for the sake of her lover and for the sake of repaying her kindness, the inner contradictions are intertwined, and she leans against the wall and tells her worries. This is a very valuable performance. The rest of the roles are mediocre, and Tu Guangqi has not made any progress.

For the sake of struggle, you must sacrifice money, sacrifice happiness, sacrifice reputation, sacrifice energy, and even sacrifice your life. Whatever you have to sacrifice, sacrifice it. Ordinary people are willing to sacrifice money, happiness, reputation, and energy. When it comes to sacrificing their lives, they are reluctant. So many struggles fail.

Chapter 5: The Red Skirt Makes the Pomegranate Jealous

At this time, Li Zicheng and others had disturbed Henan, and disaster victims and green forests in various parts of Henan took the opportunity to respond, and it became a complete collapse, which could not be contained. Naturally, Qixian could not avoid being involved in the vortex. There were rumors everywhere, and there were several shocks in one night. Everyone said that the bandits on a certain mountain had joined forces with Li Zicheng, and would attack the county seat soon; some said that the bandits in a certain place would come to burn and loot the county seat, and had secretly sent many accomplices, disguised as hungry people, mixed into the city, and prepared to cooperate from within and without. Seeing that the situation was so serious, the magistrate of Qixian had to seek to stabilize people's hearts. First, he ordered more than 100 local garrison troops, led by Commander Ma, to be stationed on the slope outside the city, because that place was an important area that could resist the insurgents. He also felt that the city defense was insufficient, so he recruited strong men to help defend the city. Because he knew that Li Xin had a good reputation in the local area, had many followers, and the local people had great faith in him, he specially sent someone to invite Li Xin into the city to discuss important matters together. Li Xin believed that it was his duty to protect his hometown, so he agreed to the magistrate of Qixian to jointly defend the city. He immediately returned to his own manor, packed up, and sent his family members to live in the city; as for the manor, he had already instructed the servants to guard it, and gathered a dozen followers, preparing to go to the city immediately. He suddenly thought of Xu Jing, so he asked the servants to invite Xu Jing over for a talk. Since sending off Zhang Cangqiu, Chen Fei, and others, Xu Jing's heart was filled with the ambition to abandon his pen and join the army, and he had no more心思 to sit at his desk and read books. And his old mother had been feeling unwell for the past few days, sleeping half the day and getting up half the day, eating less and feeling tired. Although Xu Jing had invited a doctor to come and treat her, the medicine did not work. He was naturally a little upset in his heart, and when he heard the news of the unstable situation outside and the rumors of bandits attacking the city, he was even more uneasy, sitting in the study and murmuring to himself, helpless. Suddenly he saw someone from Li Jiazhuang come to invite him, so he followed the man to Li Jiazhuang and met Li Xin. Li Xin told him about this matter and asked Xu Jing to help him cooperate. Xu Jing naturally agreed. So he went back and asked Liu San to hire a small sedan chair to carry his mother to the city first, and live with Li Xin's people. Because when the bandits arrive, the outside of the city will inevitably be robbed first, while the city can still be defended. But he said this very vaguely in front of his mother, fearing that if he said it directly, his elderly mother would not be able to withstand the shock when she was sick. He also instructed Liu San to go with him to take good care of the old lady, and take several boxes and cages with him. (30)

### Drama News

The Shanghai Lingjie United Association is a very authoritative group of Pingju actors. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it has only set up a temporary office in the concession, specializing in charity work and serving its members. Recently, it has spawned two branches, the Small Group Association and the Wusheng Association.

The Small Group Association is an organization formed by general small characters in various opera troupes. The purpose is to seek business protection and progress, which is enough to enhance the power of the Linglian Association: The Wusheng Association was initiated by Liu Hanchen, Zhao Songqiao, Li Zhonglin, and Wang Xiaofang. A number of decisions were convened at Guanle Club. Their purpose is, of course, more narrowly defined, to seek happiness for the future of their industry. Unfortunately, this group does not have a sound organization, and the members who participate are also like scattered sand without unity. In the end, this Wusheng Congress quietly disappeared without a sound.
