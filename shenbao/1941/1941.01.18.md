### The US Gradually Realizes a Horseshoe-Shaped Encirclement Plan Against Japan; Japan Expresses Strong Displeasure with Hull's Remarks; Further Cooperation Between Britain and the US to Combat Aggressive Attempts

Tokyo: Japan is greatly disturbed by the US plan to build a strategic corridor on the west coast of Canada. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received intelligence regarding this plan. Japan believes this is a horseshoe-shaped plan by the US to encircle Japan. In this case, the US military bases in the Pacific will stretch from Singapore through Australia, the Philippines, the US, Canada, to Alaska. (Hai Tong News Agency, 16th)

Washington: Most commentators seem to believe that Secretary of State Hull's remarks on Wednesday, which strongly condemned aggressive countries and specifically targeted Japan, are a sign that the US is ending its neutrality. It is believed that although the US is not a belligerent, it has adopted a position that does not allow neutrality or the provisions of international law to hinder actions necessary for its self-defense. (Reuters, 17th)

London: Two influential British newspapers have recently published articles criticizing the Far East issue. One is The Times, which spoke of the pro-Dutch sentiment in the Dutch East Indies, stating that after the Netherlands was ravaged by German forces, Japan claimed it was ready to protect the Dutch colonies. Its specially dispatched mission saw that the Dutch East Indies was only willing to negotiate on an economic basis and returned to Tokyo to criticize the Dutch East Indies for not joining the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Southeast Asian Nations Liberation Society, organized by the Japanese, recently issued a declaration stating that the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, Burma, the Philippines, and India should all be liberated. However, this kind of liberation declaration is not taken seriously, as such lip service can already be seen in the Chinese areas occupied by the Japanese army. The Dutch East Indies authorities do not slacken their defenses because Japan is at war with China, and are spending huge sums on defense. British and Dutch cooperation in the East is like their cooperation in the West. The other is the Yorkshire Post, with a headline "Japan Should Reconsider," stating that the impact of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance has only led to closer cooperation between Britain and the US, and a resolute resistance to Japan's aggressive attempts. Secretary of State Hull's remarks on Wednesday indicated that the most beneficial thing for Japan is its friendly relations with the US. Even the most radical elements in Japan should know this. The same is true of Japan's relations with Britain. Japan relies on the US for machinery and essential raw materials, and 70% of Japan's foreign trade depends on Britain. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo: Tokyo newspapers today reprinted editorials criticizing Secretary of State Hull's remarks made on the 14th of this month before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, calling him a liar, slanderer, warmonger, and buying news. The editorial, titled "Hull's Distorted Testimony," stated that if one takes the example of Britain's exploitation of the interests of India, Burma, Malaya, and even China for its own benefit, and the US's imperialist practices in the Far East using the Philippines as a base, then Hull naturally believes that the result of the New Order in East Asia will be monopolization after conquest. This is because the spirit of our "benevolent rule" is fundamentally different from their doctrines. Japan, while waging the greatest war in its history, does not demand land or a small amount of reparations from China. Who can say that Japan has the ambition to conquer China? What we seek now is the universal freedom of all East Asian nations. The article also mentioned Hull's statement that the US has never threatened Japan in any way, saying that Hull's remarks are the most shameless oath ever made by any politician in any part of the world to attract our attention. (Reuters, 17th)

Chongqing: Chinese officials recently welcomed Secretary of State Hull's speech before the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying that this speech demonstrates that the US has declared the only perspective a democratic country can take on Japanese aggression, which is the position the US has adopted. Any doubts that Tokyo and other places may have had about the US's attitude towards Japan's actions in China should now be dispelled. The principles of the position adopted by Hull are the same as the principles of the position China has been forced to adopt due to Japanese aggression. Another official said that Hull has already condemned Japan's attempts to conquer China and control the entire Western Pacific. The Chinese people have always considered the Japanese aggressors to be the primary enemy of all countries that abide by order and justice. As Hull said, this matter is very important and concerns every other country. (United Press, 17th)

Swords Drawn in the House of Representatives; Debate on the Aid to Democratic Countries Act

Washington: The House of Representatives will continue the debate on Colonel Stimson's remarks today. Secretary of the Navy Knox and Chairman of the Defense Committee Nadson will also be present to testify. Colonel Stimson told the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that the crisis the US is facing now is even greater than in 1917. He urged the passage of the bill as soon as possible because it is the best and simplest form of defense. He said, "This bill greatly helps us to obtain what we need, and at the same time provides assistance to countries that are closely related to us." Feish asked Colonel Shi if he would object to the suggestion of revising the "Aid to Democratic Countries Act" to stipulate that the West Indies and other British territories be used as guarantees to the US. The colonel replied that any such revision would greatly delay the implementation of the bill. Speed is most needed in "wartime," so he expressed strong opposition to "this number of restrictions." He admitted that the production of defense materials has been delayed and said that the wartime economic transformation "cannot be accomplished overnight or within a year." Secretary of the Army was furious at Feishu's argument that the fall of Holland and Belgium was due to their geographical proximity to Germany and could not be compared with the US. The Secretary of the Army said that the size of the US Army is still not close to the Dutch and Belgian armies of last May, "nor is it close to the ideal of pure training." Feishu asked, "Whose fault is this?" The Secretary of the Army said, "It is our fault, the fault of the United States of America." Colonel Stimson continued, "In my opinion, the main point of the question is not to make the US avoid war, but to prevent war from coming to the US." Fei asked, "If Britain is our first line of defense, then you also advocate entering the war." Colonel Shi said, "I advocate helping Britain to preserve its naval strength." Eden, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from New Jersey, questioned the Secretary of the Army, "If this is not our war, what are we doing today? What are the munitions and aircraft for which everyone is clamoring? Can we also say that we are fighting a war that is not ours?" The Secretary of the Army replied, "This is our war." Colonel Shi continued, "The bill authorizes the President to hand over a portion of the US Navy to friendly countries when he believes it is beneficial to our national defense." Fei continued to question the Secretary of the Army, who finally said, "A president should have the right to send the navy to participate in the war today." Fei said, "However, he cannot do whatever he wants without being impeached." Colonel Stimson proved that "if the British Navy is destroyed or surrenders, the US will be in danger of being air-raided." (United Press, 17th)

Whether the President Should Have Full Authority is the Focus of the Dispute Over the Bill

Washington: Secretary of the Army Stimson stated yesterday to the House Foreign Affairs Committee reviewing the Lend-Lease Act that if a clause is inserted into the Lend-Lease Act preventing the transfer of any part of the US Navy to other countries, he would oppose it. He anticipated that the formal reports of Ambassador to Britain Puleit and Ambassador to France will both oppose it. Webster made the request after visiting Ganadi, who had met with Undersecretary of State Orls in the morning. It is believed that when Ganadi delivers his speech on US foreign policy on wireless tomorrow, he will announce his non-interventionist views. Weiler said that publishing Ganadi's and Puleit's reports will show that Britain may not be able to obtain profits. Webster also accused, "Today, senior officials working in the Army Department all believe that we may join the war on April 1. People in Washington who are well-informed of the news should know about this." It is generally believed that Stimson's appointment as Secretary of the Army was due to his pro-war attitude. (United Press, 17th)

Small Warship Funding Approved; President Separately Indicates Shipbuilding Fund

Washington: The House Naval Affairs Committee unanimously approved the Navy Department's request to allocate US$90,900,000 for the construction of 400 new small warships. It is reported that these small warships are mostly submarine chasers, minesweepers, and torpedo boats. (Reuters, 17th)

Washington: President Roosevelt formally requested Congress to approve the construction of 200 merchant ships under emergency measures, and requested US$213 million for this purpose. The President submitted a message to Congress, stating that "he is convinced that it is necessary for the national interest to immediately take measures to prevent the United States from being affected by the shortage of world freighters." He also said that the construction of these ships should not hinder the shipbuilding program already underway by the US Shipping Board, nor should it hinder the construction of the US Navy. There are different opinions on whether the new ships planned by the President will be lent to Britain or used to supplement the existing ships that will be transferred to Britain. (Reuters, 17th)

Washington: According to a report on the 17th, Assistant Secretary of War Patterson said yesterday that the US Army will implement the original plan regardless of various obstacles. In June, warships will be available on very favorable terms. The main purpose of President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease plan is to make the US government in effect the sole buyer and distributor of American-produced war equipment. All kinds of war equipment will enter and exit through this agency. In this way, the US can be in a position to distribute this war equipment to the US and other democratic countries whose defense is of great importance to the US. Judging from the opinions of Hull and Stimson, etc., obtained by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, it can be seen that government spokespersons have now presented very powerful evidence for the Lend-Lease Act. No one disputes the purpose of this case, and the only dispute lies in placing great power in the hands of the President alone in this case. Any actions taken under this case must obviously be made public, but there is a growing feeling that the steps taken by the President under this case should only be known in advance by the President and a small committee composed of one or two members of Congress and one or two members of the Cabinet. In addition, there are more and more people who advocate that this case should specifically designate Britain as the beneficiary of this case. Former Republican presidential candidate Wilkie's position of supporting President Roosevelt, sacrificing his entire political future, is still being praised. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters that he supports this case. As far as he knows, the British government has no assets that can be used to purchase war equipment in the US, other than the US$177,500,000 he reported to Congress on Wednesday. The funds held by Canada and other British territories in the US cannot be used by London because each British territory, like a family, has its own difficulties. The assets owned by several members of a family do not necessarily belong to other members of the family. As for the value of British territories' assets in the US, Morgenthau declined to estimate it. (Reuters, 17th)

Washington: Senator Zhang Le, a Democrat from Montana, yesterday asked President Roosevelt to release the reports of former Ambassador to Britain Ganadi and former Ambassador to France. It is estimated that 1,418,000 people will be trained. It is said that the House Naval Affairs Committee also approved the $9,000,000 naval shipbuilding program at the same time. Secretary Ba also said that the Army engineers, regardless of the bad weather and delays, are now extending their working hours to complete the training equipment. (United Press, 17th)

Robot-Piloted Aircraft; Thirteen Arrive in Hawaii

Honolulu: The US Army announced last night that a full squadron of radio-controlled, robot-piloted aircraft, 13 in number, have arrived here for use by the Hawaiian Air Force. Major General Martin, the commander of the Air Force here, said that these robot aircraft are the most humane development of modern warfare and science. These unmanned aircraft are intended for attack and destruction, and are no different from manned bombers. The first squadron of robot aircraft will appear before the summer, at which time they will be managed by specially trained personnel. Major General Martin said that this red robot aircraft is specially used for training ground troops to use anti-aircraft guns. It is said that the distance, altitude, and range of the machine will be determined after the Hawaiian Air Force, anti-aircraft artillery, and coastal artillery regiments conduct tests. Major General Martin also said that the machine was developed based on tests conducted in Europe of similar strategies. (United Press, 17th)

Tokyo: The newly appointed Ambassador to the US, General Nomura, has purchased a ticket for a certain Japanese ship leaving Yokohama for San Francisco on the 23rd of this month, but the official departure date has not yet been announced. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo: Last night, 200 well-known figures hosted a banquet for the newly appointed Ambassador to Germany, Lieutenant General Oshima. According to a certain newspaper, the entire country has high hopes for Oshima. Oshima was originally scheduled to depart for Berlin tomorrow, but now it will be postponed to the end of this month.

Editorial

### The Changing Industrial and Commercial Circles in a Changing Situation

Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles have mostly obtained abundant surpluses this year due to the rising prices. They have deepened their desire to hoard, thinking that they have a winning strategy and that there is a shortcut to getting rich. They do not realize that what they have obtained today is actually a gift from the troubled times. If there were no powerful people plundering and manipulating in various ways, then the supply and demand adjustment of all products would not only not suffer from scarcity, but also not suffer from unevenness. Speculators would have no opportunity, and hoarders would not dare to hoard. Prices would be stable, and people's livelihoods would be secure. How could there be such an insecure situation that can be exploited? It is precisely because the water is deeper and the fire is hotter that some people get rich in joy, while others commit suicide because they cannot make a living. In previous years, prices sometimes fluctuated, and although they gradually became more expensive, they did not become extraordinarily expensive. For example, rice, flour, and oil, which are indispensable for general living, each had a considerable regularity and limit in their rise and fall. However, the price of rice at the beginning and end of this year is more than twice as high, which is really caused by evil forces.

Looking to the future, it is difficult to say anything definitively. If the situation remains the same, then the operation of various industries will inevitably be like a blind man riding a blind horse, ending in confusion. In normal times, the prosperity or decline of a business is represented by the amount of currency earned in surplus. However, in a year of drastic price changes, everything loses its normal state, and a comparative view must be made from both quantitative and value perspectives. In this case, gains and losses are difficult to say. Even in this year, although prices are high and surpluses are abundant, if you ask how much the increase in sales is, and how much the amount of goods that can be purchased with the surplus is, then it can be guaranteed that the absolute majority of them are inferior to previous years. The increase in profit with the reduction in trade is an abnormal state of business and is not worth learning from. Although the current price may have reached a saturation point, it is still not certain. However, the vast majority of general living is supported by salaries. General salaries have gradually increased due to the environment, but they are far from matching the rapid rise in prices. Therefore, the general standard of living has actually declined, and the general purchasing power has actually weakened. Now, incidents of demanding increased salaries and wages are occurring repeatedly in an attempt to offset the pressure on life caused by the soaring prices. However, on the other hand, the expenditure of operating expenses is expanding, indirectly raising the rising prices. Thus, the cycle continues endlessly. Without effective handling of price stabilization, even if salaries and wages increase, the baseness of life may be far worse than today. Although prices are high, the profits generated will also not be as good as in previous years. This is a natural consequence.

What is the future trend of prices, will it be hovering? That is, there will be no significant rise or fall within a considerable period of time, but it will not be stable, and its nature is a sign of brewing momentum. Will it continue to rise? Based on the trend of the past two years, what can be expected is that the products in the occupied areas will suffer more severe and profound exploitation. The products of China are no longer at the disposal of the Chinese people. Even if some are carried, they must be confiscated and punished, whipped and humiliated. As for the export and import of ordinary commercial methods, the Chinese have absolutely no guarantee, they can be taken as they please, and they only eat leftovers and look for gaps. For example, how are rice and wheat, which are products of the Yangtze River basin, now? Not only has the sales area such as Shanghai risen due to the inability to transport domestic products, but the production area is also unusually expensive. Is this because production is insufficient? It is because they are all loaded and carried into the Eastern Ocean. The same is true for oil beans and peanuts, and the same is true for silk, fur, pigs, sheep, and six livestock. Why is it so? The Chinese are ignorant, but they have a simple and clear policy, which is "to use war to support war." If they are allowed to carry out their policies, then the continued rise in prices is to be expected. Which citizen does not hate to hear about the continued rise in prices? Speculators, manipulators, and even general industrial and commercial operators, may be deeply pleased to hear the observation of continued rises. Hating to hear or being happy to hear is emotion, whether it rises or not is the situation. The reporter certainly does not want to push the waves with the market and the industrial and commercial circles, nor can he avoid mentioning it because the citizens hate to hear it. However, what I urgently want to tell the citizens and warn the market and the industrial and commercial circles is: the observation of continued price rises is actually based on the premise that the situation remains the same. The extraordinary expensiveness of prices must end with the deterioration of the situation. If the shackles of external violence cannot be shaken off for a day, then the shackles of difficult life cannot be lifted for a day. Therefore, deeply hating the extraordinary expensiveness of prices is better than cursing the deterioration of the situation. Or what is called the situation has undergone a major change this year, and there may be even greater changes in the future. What kind of change? In previous years, the situation in the Far East formed a self-contained circle, that is, whether the situation was good or bad, the problem depended on how it evolved in this circle. This year, the situation in the Far East has only become a corner, that is, whether the situation is good or bad depends on how the entire world evolves. This year is different from previous years. This is the so-called major change. Only this year has the change reached this stage, so if the whole world does not improve, then the occupied areas of China will be directly targeted by violence to support the war, and indirectly become a food platform for violence to participate in the world war, and thus suffer more harsh exploitation. What should be clearly recognized about this is that there has been a major change this year, and even a thousand changes and ten thousand changes are possible. What is absolutely unchanged is that regardless of the scope of the so-called situation, whether it is the Far East or the world, in short, China takes getting rid of the shackles of violence as the only prerequisite for price stabilization and the recovery of life, and also as the only prerequisite for improving everything. If the premise is not established, even if you deeply hate and hate the expensive price, it will be useless, and it will be useless to avoid mentioning its trend. What is a bigger change? That is, the situation may have to go through a more terrible period, but the violence will fail, and the period is not far away. The world situation, including the Far East situation, will eventually improve. The situation has the possibility of suddenly becoming clear, and those who blindly seek profits will see themselves falling into the abyss. It is hoped that the enlightened industrial and commercial circles will operate fairly and not seek huge profits. It is hoped that the market will turn back.

### Military Commission Announces the Dissolution of the New Fourth Army: The Army's Total Dissolution and Reorganization Completed; Army Commander Ye Ting Captured and Subject to Military Law; Deputy Army Commander Xiang Ying is Being Pursued

Chongqing – The New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army disobeyed orders, mutinied, and attacked friendly forces. Commander-in-Chief Gu has taken emergency measures to enforce military law, disband the entire army, and complete its reorganization. Army Commander Ye Ting has been captured and handed over to military law for trial. Deputy Army Commander Xiang Ying is on the run and is being pursued. The Military Commission's circular and the Military Commission spokesperson's statement are recorded as follows:

(Circular) According to a telegram from Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Area, the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army disobeyed orders and refused to comply with deployments. Since last month, it has concentrated its entire army in the Jiangnan area, deliberately stirring up the war situation, destroying the front lines, and plotting against the government for more than just one day. At the beginning of this month, it secretly moved south from Jing County and dared to openly attack the positions of our forward troops on the fourth, endangering the nation, acting as a henchman for the Japanese, and losing all sense of morality. Our forward troops who were attacked had no choice but to retaliate in self-defense against this unexpected mutiny; otherwise, the soldiers of the front lines could not defend themselves, and the entire national policy would inevitably be completely destroyed. Looking to the future, we are filled with pain and anger. In order to cope with the emergency and uphold discipline, I had no choice but to take emergency measures. Regarding the army's entire mutiny plot, the confession of the army's Chief of Staff, who was captured yesterday, has been telegraphed to you for review. The entire New Fourth Army has now been disbanded and its reorganization completed. Army Commander Ye Ting was captured on the spot that day. Deputy Army Commander Xiang Ying has escaped and has not been captured. Orders have been issued to strictly apprehend him and bring him to justice. All the details of the handling of the New Fourth Army's mutiny have been reported in advance, awaiting your approval. According to the report, the New Fourth Army disobeyed orders and mutinied, and its rebellious actions are obvious. If it is not severely punished, how can the mission of the National Revolutionary Army be completed? The designation of the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army is hereby revoked immediately. Army Commander Ye Ting is hereby dismissed from his post and handed over to military law for trial and punished according to law. Deputy Army Commander Xiang Ying is hereby ordered to be strictly apprehended by all armies and brought to justice for interrogation, in order to uphold military discipline and benefit the war of resistance. This circular is hereby issued. (Statement) A reporter inquired with the Military Commission about the truth of the Jiangnan New Fourth Army's disobedience, mutiny, and attack on friendly forces, which led to its being sanctioned by military discipline. The spokesperson of the commission made the following statement: This decision is entirely a matter of rectifying military discipline. The New Fourth Army suffered punishment because it violated military discipline, disobeyed deployments, attacked forward troops, and carried out a mutiny. In order to adjust the defense of the army corps, the Central Government issued an order on December 9th of the 29th year of the Republic, limiting the New Fourth Army to move to the area north of the Yangtze River before December 31st of last year, and to the area north of the Yellow River before January 31st of the 30th year of the Republic, and designated the area of Fanchang and Tongling as its northward route. However, the army did not follow the order and instead made excuses to delay its movement. Commander Gu, for the sake of military orders and dignity, ordered the army to cross the river northward from its original location. The army brazenly disregarded this and continued to act without authorization, not only not crossing the river northward, but also fleeing south from Jing County to the Taiping area, attempting to attack the headquarters of Commander-in-Chief Shangguan. Coincidentally, the Fortieth Division was being transferred from southern Jiangsu to the rear for reorganization and training. The New Fourth Army had long been aware of its marching route and knew that the division would arrive at Sanxi on the first of this month. On the evening of the fourth, the entire army secretly moved to Maolin (eighty li south of Jing County), dividing its forces into three routes, left, center, and right, to attack the division. The division was caught off guard and had no choice but to resist in self-defense. Commander-in-Chief Gu of the Third War Area, in order to rectify discipline, ordered sanctions. By the twelfth, the army had been completely disbanded. Army Commander Ye Ting and others who were captured have now been handed over to military law for trial. The army's designation has been revoked by explicit order. This is the process by which the army violated orders and ultimately suffered sanctions. This New Fourth Army's disobedience and mutiny was in fact a consistent conspiracy by the army. According to Commander Gu's telegram, the confession of Zhao Xibo, Chief of Staff of the New Fourth Army, who was captured, can clearly reveal the truth. The confession is as follows: (1) Ye Ting and others, since receiving the order to move, had already decided not to obey the order to move north, and had long planned to move to southern Jiangsu, first occupying Jintan, Danyang, Jurong, Langxi, Liyang and other counties, expanding the Southeast Political Bureau, strengthening its structure, and aiming to control the Jinghu-Hangzhou triangular area and establish a base area in the short term. (2) First, political workers, cadres, officers, and armed soldiers were successively sent to southern Jiangsu to expand their influence in the five counties of Jintan, Danyang, Jurong, Langxi, and Liyang, to await the arrival of the entire force before launching a resistance, and also annexing the National Army in the Second Guerrilla Area, repeating the situation of Huangqiao in northern Jiangsu, in order to expand to Taihu Lake and western Zhejiang. (3) In order to extort 500,000 in travel expenses and ammunition, all troops were concentrated in the Jing County and Fanchang area. (4) Later, upon receiving the order to cross the river from its original location in southern Anhui, they were quite disappointed, but still hoped to receive ammunition and then use the excuse of Japanese blockade to decide not to cross the river from southern Anhui, in order to realize their goal of occupying southern Jiangsu. (5) The Fortieth Division was transferred from southern Jiangsu to the rear for training. The New Fourth Army knew its marching route in detail and knew that the division arrived near Sanxi on the afternoon of the first. The New Fourth Army considered attacking the Fortieth Division to be the only opportunity, so they made a plan on the third and secretly moved the entire army to Maolin on the night of the fourth, dividing their forces into three routes, left, center, and right, to take the initiative in order to break through each one. Their plan was to eliminate the Fortieth Division and then have its left detachment produce the 108th Division in the Yiyaodian area, and the three center and right detachments rush to the east bank of Hule to seize warehouses, clothing, grain, ammunition, and directly attack Commander-in-Chief Shangguan's headquarters in a certain place, and then have the left detachment go to Langxi and Liyang to meet with the troops in southern Jiangsu and attack the National Army in the Langxi area in order to force the central government to accommodate their demands. (6) Ye Ting, Xiang Ying, and others sent out various telegrams at Chenshi on the fifth, making gentle statements, which were deliberately intended to delay and pretend that they had no intention of starting a war, so as to shift the blame to the National Army. The army's mutiny plot is clearly revealed. The Fortieth Division fought back in a hurry, out of self-defense. Commander Gu took appropriate measures to deal with the army and completed its reorganization, which was a necessary measure to maintain military discipline. At a time when the whole country is united, it is extremely painful that such a mutiny occurred. The central government believes that military orders must be implemented and discipline must be maintained in order to win the final victory in the war of resistance, so it resolutely revoked the army's designation and handed over the mutiny officers to military law for trial and strictly punished them. Fortunately, the soldiers of the front lines worked hard and the local people clearly distinguished between loyalty and treachery and assisted in quelling the rebellion, and most of the officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army deeply understood the great righteousness, refused to join the rebellion, and surrendered one after another, so that the rebellion could be quelled in a few days. This was due to Commander Gu's resolute response. (Seventeenth telegram)

One thing that is worth noting is that the informal cotton market in the British Concession quickly closed after hearing the news of Zhong's kidnapping. Also, Yu Shaopu (transliteration), the director of cotton goods at Dounai Company, disappeared last night. According to his assistant, he was invited by a friend to a banquet in the Chinese Concession and did not return.

### Thousand Thai Troops Attack Southern Laos; French Troops Forced to Retreat to East Bank of Mekong; French New Commander Inspects Cambodia

Saigon - Fifteen hundred Thai troops, using a combination of tanks, artillery, cavalry, and infantry, launched a small-scale "lightning attack" on southern Laos yesterday, forcing French troops to retreat to a location twelve miles outside of Pakse on the east bank of the Mekong River. The French side claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on the Thai troops. This decisive battle has placed three small areas between the Mekong River in southern Laos and the Thai border in Thai hands. It is heard that people in the front town of Pakse are currently busy building defenses, and they believe that the Siamese army will not be able to cross the one-mile-wide Mekong River to launch an attack. It is reported that General Mauldent, the new commander-in-chief of the French army, went to Cambodia on Wednesday evening to inspect the French army and its defenses there. He will return to Saigon soon. (Seventeenth United Press telegram)

Vietnam - Official sources recently announced that our forces have repeatedly engaged Thai troops in the Basak Heights area (within Laos), with the battle on the twelfth of this month being the most important. On that day, a company of our infantry fought against a battalion of Thai troops. As a result, we gained the upper hand, with only one officer and one adjutant, along with several soldiers, being injured. On the fifteenth, Thai soldiers and artillery, under the cover of several tanks, attacked our forces west of Pakse City in Laos, but were repelled. On the same day, our patrol was active west of Paklai City in Laos (west of Viet Hoi City), and as a result, there were no traces of Thai soldiers from that location to the border. Only one of our men was slightly injured. In addition, there were no incidents in the entire territory of Cambodia on the fourteenth and fifteenth. (Sixteenth Havas telegram)

Hanoi - Official sources recently announced that several Thai planes repeatedly bombed Pakse Town today, injuring four Laotians, one of whom was seriously injured and died. In addition, a plane of unknown nationality flew to the southern part of Nam Ky and the Saigon port area this morning, flying quite high, and then flew west. In addition, one thousand Thai troops, including infantry, artillery, cavalry, and tank teams, attacked our army on the right bank of the Mekong River in Pakse Town yesterday. Because our army was outnumbered, it retreated to Pakse City after inflicting heavy damage on the Thai army. Our casualties were only fifteen. (Sixteenth Havas telegram)

Saigon - Reliable sources recently claimed that a French ship carrying 200 French airmen from Dhaka to Madagascar may arrive here in the next day or two. The French here are not only in urgent need of aircraft, but also of skilled airmen. Neutral observers say that the French army on the Thai-Vietnamese border is very pessimistic because Vietnam lacks air defenses. (Seventeenth United Press telegram)

Hanoi - Viet Governor Decoux recently issued a statement saying that on Wednesday, the Thai army attempted to capture the French outpost west of Pakse, but was repelled. The French side only suffered one minor injury. It is heard that this Thai army of over a thousand men was carrying heavy artillery and tanks. The French side resisted with a small batch of troops. On the same day, they also bravely prevented the advance of the Thai army west of Paklai. Later, the French reconnaissance team cleared the enemy from the territory to the border. Only one person was slightly injured. (Seventeenth Reuters telegram)

### US Bans Aircraft Shipments to Thailand; Thailand to Rely on Japan for Supplies

Bangkok - The Thai Acting Foreign Minister Tirek told a United Press reporter that he had met with the French Chargé d'Affaires Garreau and frankly exchanged views on the Thai-Vietnamese conflict. He stated that Thailand hoped to resolve the border dispute peacefully, but the talks were inconclusive. The Foreign Minister was unwilling to predict whether the dispute could be resolved without military means. It is claimed that the scope of the war is continuing to expand, but he said that if Vietnam sends a capable envoy to Bangkok, Thailand would be very willing to negotiate with it. He also said that although the United States had cancelled the shipment of aircraft to Thailand, Thai-US relations were still very friendly. Ten of the aircraft had already arrived, but a portion was intercepted in Manila. The Thais inevitably misunderstood and became dissatisfied with this. He stated that Thailand would rely on Japan for aircraft and other supplies, but Thailand had no special political relationship with Japan. Its non-aggression treaty with Japan was no different from the one it concluded with Britain. All that Thailand needed from the United States was a friendly commercial and navigational treaty. The reporter's opinion is that the impact of the US ban on aircraft shipments to Thailand is not as great as the US pressure on Thailand to prevent it from raising the border issue at this time. US Secretary of State Hull's policy of maintaining the status quo in the Far East is extremely opposed to Thailand's position. Thailand claims that it can no longer tolerate France's procrastination. In any case, Thai-US relations will be greatly affected in the future by Washington's implementation of the method of requiring a license for Thailand to purchase goods. Unofficial US sources here claim that at this time, Thailand's exclusion from the US market not only loses a good customer, but will also cause Thailand to fall into the arms of Japan.

### Japan Inducing Thailand to Attack Vietnam to Facilitate Japanese Advance to the South

Saigon - The people of Saigon, an important trading city in southern Vietnam, seem to be quite optimistic about the current situation. This is very different from Hanoi, which must listen to Vichy's instructions and is influenced by Japanese power. Even if various rumors such as Japanese troops landing in southern Vietnam, Thai planes bombing, and Thai troops invading are constantly spreading, the people of Saigon are still generally optimistic. The optimism of the people of Saigon is clearly due to its proximity to Manila and Singapore, and due to the general belief that Anglo-American cooperation will prevent Japan from further advancing south. There are also various reports, such as that Britain and the United States are advising Thailand diplomatically to prevent Thailand from launching a large-scale attack on Vietnam, which also gives the people of Saigon a hopeful outlook on the future. In Hanoi, only well-informed officials know that Japan is behind the scenes instigating Thailand to attack Vietnam, but in Saigon, such news is widely spread. According to news here yesterday, Thailand had obtained as many as forty bombers from Japan in the previous month alone. News from Tokyo that Britain is manipulating Thailand's anti-Vietnamese actions behind the scenes is not considered ridiculous by well-informed sources here. The news they spread is the opposite of Tokyo's, saying that the British authorities are currently doing everything possible to get Thailand to refuse to accept Japanese military assistance and military supplies. It is heard that the British believe that such military supplies to Thailand may be used to attack Singapore and the Malay Federation once the Japanese launch their southward advance. In addition, Saigon and Hanoi under Japanese control have a different situation, that is, the spirit they show in resisting Japanese aggression. In Hanoi and Haiphong, the people are terrified because Japanese army and navy sentries are increasing from time to time. However, Saigon merchants, who rely on trade with British territories for their livelihood, show pro-British sentiments and resolutely advocate resisting further Japanese oppression. Also, Saigon residents' hopes for large-scale trade with Britain and the United States, and their unwillingness to trade with Japan, are very welcome to the news of future Anglo-Vietnamese rapprochement. Well-informed sources here believe that the closeness between Britain and Vietnam can also make the United States show a more friendly attitude towards Vietnam, which would allow Vietnam to obtain many necessary aircraft from the United States. Observers here believe that the current relatively quiet actions of Japan in Vietnam are the calm before the storm. They also claim that Japan will launch its southward attack before the US defenses in Manila become strong. If the US, Britain, and Vietnam reach an understanding, it can strengthen Vietnam's attitude towards Japan. According to people who spoke with reporters, Japan is trying to lure Thailand into attacking Vietnam in order to drive away the French forces along the coast, so that Vietnam will be more easily subdued and comply with Japan's demands. Those people also believe that more prudent Thai diplomats, under the advice of Britain and the United States, may be able to quell the power of the Japanese in the Thai military. Observers also claim that another strange situation may also occur, that is, the Japanese will help the French resist Thailand, so as to obtain the right to land in southern Vietnam. Well-informed sources here also believe that Britain and the United States will reconsider the matter before allowing the Japanese to occupy Cochinchina, which produces a lot of rubber, because this move by the Japanese is also to give the Japanese a ladder to advance to the East Indies and Singapore. Officials here all hope that the United States can immediately recognize the importance of selling fighter jets to Vietnam, because if the United States can sell aircraft to Vietnam, it can resolve Thailand's enthusiasm and reduce the Japanese further advance into Vietnam.

### Japanese Naval and Military Leaders Continue Consultations; Diet to Reconvene Next Tuesday; Prime Minister to Report on Diplomacy

### Soviet-Japanese Compromise Remains Distant and Uncertain

Moscow - The general impression here is that the Soviet-Japanese agreement remains unresolved and that a compromise seems distant and uncertain. The new Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Takekawa, arrived here in October last year. At that time, it was generally believed that a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact could be signed in a very short period of time, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka both said that there was no reason why the relations between the two countries should not be placed on a normal footing. Therefore, it was generally expected that the Japanese ambassador would bring a plan to achieve a compromise between the two sides. However, although the Japanese ambassador has met with Molotov several times, this compromise remains as distant as ever. Many believe that Japan is prepared to make far-reaching concessions to the Soviet Union in order to seek Soviet recognition of "Manchukuo" and to stop aiding China. Rumor has it that Japan will recognize Inner Mongolia as a Soviet sphere of influence and grant the Soviet Union special railway and export facilities, and even compromise with the Soviet side on the South Sakhalin issue. However, Japan has always been unwilling to compromise on the fishing issue, which is of utmost importance to itself, and the Soviet Union has not been willing to acknowledge the loss of fishing rights after the Russo-Japanese War.

### Foreign Observers Discuss Japan's Future

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Moreover, Hideyoshi Toyotomi's plan also included conquering India, Persia, and the islands near the continent, including Taiwan, the Philippines, and the islands of the South China Sea. Later, Japan isolated itself from foreign countries. For two hundred years, the country was closed off, using the sea as a defense. Later, Perry's arrival awakened Japan. A group of anti-foreign figures under Yoshida Shoin felt that they could no longer ignore Western science, so they decided to learn and master it in order to deal with external forces. However, what they learned was only material culture, not spiritual civilization. They were completely satisfied with their own ethics, so they only learned a little material culture. They had neither the ability nor the creative genius, so Japan's industry was still far behind other countries. After Japan came into contact with foreign countries, everything showed great progress, but when the issue of security was considered, she returned to her past policy of isolation. Since Manchuria was occupied by Japan, Japan's policy of isolation has been extended overseas. In the occupied areas, foreign interests are not allowed to intrude, lacking any mutually beneficial relationships. For three years, Japan's censorship system has been implemented, and even thought has been controlled. All production has been reduced to the lowest limit, foreign trade is gradually declining, and gold reserves are almost exhausted. The United States, which once supplied Japan, has also imposed an embargo in retaliation for the infringement of its interests. Japan frequently sends overtures to its neighbor, Soviet Russia, but it does not know that disaster is imminent. It will never give up the idea of ​​recovering lost territory. The depletion of the enemy's strength is its best opportunity. Before the Sino-Japanese Incident in 1937, the Japanese warlords did not pose much of a threat in North China. However, the situation is different today. Although the central officials have withdrawn, guerrilla teams have been formed in villages everywhere, fiercely resisting. They are determined to prevent the use of their resources. Japan's attempt to organize or train Chinese troops in the occupied areas to maintain order has obviously failed. As for Japan's southward advance, Japan may take southward steps to the extent that it does not cause hostile actions from Britain and the United States. However, the first reaction of Britain and the United States to this is an embargo on all trade. Japan's war of aggression against China, regardless of raw materials, transportation, bombs, and aircraft, still relies on foreign imports. Then, once the army is abroad, but is attacked from behind, you can imagine how much danger Japan should take. The Soviet army, after suffering setbacks in the Finnish War, is working hard to reorganize and is now standing by. Once Japan's strength is exhausted, it will take the opportunity to launch an attack. It has refused to accept the mutual non-aggression treaty and the prohibition of aid to China because it has sufficient "credibility." If the Soviet Union decides to attack Manchuria, see how Japan will resist. According to the observation of a famous German general, Japan's army is considered no match for any European country. Japan's air force is outdated and lacks personnel. Don't even think about attacking a powerful land country. As for Germany, it wants to use Japan to divert the attention of Britain and the United States from the European war, but it will not sacrifice all of its operations in China as a price for assistance. For the sake of the personal glory of a few Japanese warlords, a meaningless war of aggression against China was launched, resulting in the exhaustion of financial resources and unspeakable suffering. However, in order to maintain prestige, it has to move forward reluctantly. In fact, if it does not know how to retreat in the face of difficulties, then it will inevitably sink deeper and deeper, and the difficulties will inevitably become greater and greater. It seems that it has returned to the end of Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and because of overly ambitious policies, it will be reduced to a small country again. (End) (Sixteenth Telegram)

### British Government Will Continue to Have Changes

London Reuters correspondent in the House of Commons lounge claimed that further changes in the British government may be possible. Since Halifax was appointed as the ambassador to the United States, it was expected that Deputy Foreign Minister Butler would be promoted. Now it is learned that Butler may soon be transferred to the Minister of Education. If this is true, then the current Director of Finance of the Department of Land, Mr. Rong, may succeed Butler as the Foreign Minister under the new Foreign Minister Eden. It is not surprising that Eden and Law jointly engaged in the so-called "Young Conservative Movement" before joining the Department of Land to promote a more active war policy. Law was the son of Prime Minister Bonar Law in 1922. (Reuters, 17th)

### British Naval and Air Forces Jointly Search for German Aircraft Nests in the Mediterranean Catania Suffers Another Fierce Bombardment Malta Attacked Six Times in One Day

London Since the British fleet suffered an attack on January 10 and the aircraft carrier "Illustrious" was hit and damaged, it is expected that the British Navy Royal Air Force will immediately pay attention to the German air force bases widely deployed in the Mediterranean. (International News Agency, 17th)

London Reuters Air Force correspondent said that in terms of air power, Germany is fighting on two fronts. The German air force team in the Mediterranean is based on Sicily and has only attacked the British fleet once, achieving a slight victory. The price it paid was the disclosure of the German aircraft nest in Catania. The British Air Force immediately went to bomb it. The German Air Force in the Mediterranean may have other bases, such as Sardinia, in order to control the narrowest part of the so-called "Italian Lake." It places great hope on the sky: (1) To force the British fleet in the Mediterranean to separate east and west and cannot unite; (2) To relieve the Libyan Italian army's storage and enable the Italian army to continue its war against the British army in North Africa; (3) At least to prevent Britain from continuing to provide military assistance to Greece before spring, so that the Italian army in Albania has the opportunity to counterattack and recover lost territory. However, Germany's ambitious plan must continuously replenish its losses in air force manpower and material resources in order to maintain it. As the harassment of the German forces in the Mediterranean intensifies, the British can also send troops to land in Sicily to eliminate the German aircraft nests. This move is not difficult to implement, because Malta is very close. (Reuters, 17th)

Cairo The British Air Force here issued a bulletin yesterday, stating that the British Air Force had decided to attack the Catania airport in Italian-owned Sicily on Sunday night. Thirty to forty enemy planes at the port were bombed and caught fire or were severely damaged. The port of Benghazi in Italian-owned Libya was also fiercely attacked on the nights of Monday and Tuesday. Many bombs hit the main dike, and the roof of the customs office caught fire. A violent explosion occurred at the base of the dike. Other British planes bombed the port roofs, administrative offices, and ships. On the way back, the British planes also strafed the Bonina airfield, setting two enemy planes on fire and damaging several others. In addition, British fighter planes continuously patrolled the area between Doberuk and Duna, where the vanguard of the British army in Libya is located, but did not encounter any enemy planes in combat. According to photos taken by British planes surveying Catania in Sicily, the night attack on the port on Sunday was more effective than initially imagined. Thirty to forty enemy planes were bombed and caught fire or were severely damaged. One hangar was completely destroyed, another hangar was severely damaged, and a third hangar was also hit. The administrative office was severely damaged, and there were also bomb craters on the airfield. In addition, on the nights of Monday and Tuesday, British planes bombed the storage depots in Asmara and Asab in Italian East Africa. Except for one fighter plane that was shot down in Libya, all the other British planes that participated in the above battles returned safely. (Reuters, 17th)

Malta Enemy planes attacked Malta on Wednesday. One air raid at noon, two in the afternoon, and three at night. The night raids caused slight damage to civilian houses, but there were no casualties. The first air raid in the afternoon was quite fierce. Enemy dive bombers also participated in the attack. The British Air Force's planes and equipment were not damaged, and there were no deaths or injuries among the crew. A cluster of bungalows in the Vanlai district was hit by bombs, killing and injuring several people. It is believed that the enemy planes have lost many planes in the operation. (Reuters, 17th)

### German Troops in Romania Continue to Increase The Situation in the Balkans Remains Serious There Are Preparations to Assist Italy in Attacking Greece in the Spring Turkey Closely Monitors Developments

London The Independent French News Agency's Steinhoff dispatch stated that the number of German troops arriving in Romania continues to increase. It is estimated that the total number now reaches twelve divisions. There is a great sense of unease in Romania, and it is expected that the number of German troops will soon reach eighteen divisions. Romanian military personnel believe that Germany's actions are aimed at (1) occupying Romania in the event of an incident endangering Germany's food supply; (2) threatening the countries of Southeast Europe, especially Turkey, and preparing to launch an offensive against Greece in the spring. Most of the German troops came directly from France to Romania. An officer said that they left Paris and arrived in Romania a week later. Several French Renault trucks accompanied the army. The German troops in Romania are divided into four major teams. The first team is stationed in Moldavia, facing the Soviet border. The second team is stationed in the Bucharest area and Ploiesti to protect the oil fields.

After being fiercely bombed, thousands of square yards were ablaze, with flames soaring and explosions continuing. Most of Wilhelmshaven's military targets were in the fire pit. At 5:00 am yesterday morning, a large team of British planes attacked the area again. Flying to the Dutch coast, they saw the sky all red, so they flew straight to the place with the fire. When they arrived at Wilhelmshaven, they dropped heavy bombs on the burning fire pit and other places, making the fire even fiercer and causing fires in other places.

### The Relationship of Pain to Us

When we feel a headache or toothache, people generally say that it is just a minor illness, nothing serious, and there is no need to pay much attention to it. However, although pain is not a serious disease, it often causes us a lot of trouble, making us feel inconvenienced, for example:

When we have a slight headache, we cannot sit quietly, we cannot continue our work, nor can we go to the movies. Even going for a walk outdoors becomes impossible.

When we have a slight toothache, then the delicious fruits and sweets have to be sacrificed, and harder foods don't even need to be mentioned. How pitiful!

When we suffer from _____________, we cannot move around at will, and naturally we cannot exercise. In fact, we can say that we cannot move an inch.

When we suffer from menstrual pain, then this kind of pain comes as scheduled, making it even more painful!

Any kind of pain can make us feel discouraged. In the business world, we cannot decide how to deal with something in a timely manner. In the social world, we cannot keep our appointments, and our family's ______________ also has to be sacrificed. Therefore, even a little bit of pain can cause great damage to our physical health and enjoyment of life. If we do not stop it in time, it will cause even more harm.

However, generally speaking, we are very lucky to be born in ___________ the world, because the progress of science allows us to easily solve various problems. When the pain starts, if you have two pills of _____________ pain, you can completely stop it in ten minutes. Sanlitong is the most effective pain reliever among modern medicines, no matter where the pain occurs.

Sanlitong is absolutely safe and harmless because it is produced by Switzerland's Semi-Meng Co., Ltd., and can be absolutely trusted.

### Finance The Tension in the Foreign Exchange Market Dissipates The Prices of British and American Currencies Rise Consistently

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed price fluctuated by five points, and the informal market for British and American currencies rebounded and strengthened, and people's minds were slightly stabilized. However, it was still soft in the early morning. The January U.S. exchange rate was initially 5.25 yuan. Then, due to Guangbang's telegram from Hong Kong, speculators took profits and exited the market, both selling about one million U.S. dollars. In the middle, it was heard that HSBC also had supplies, so it gradually eased. The January U.S. exchange rate rose from 5.25 yuan to 5.34375 yuan, and closed steadily at noon. In the afternoon, speculators continued to sell the current month's U.S. exchange rate, trading at 5.375 yuan, but it softened again at the close. As a result, the British gold spot was 39.0625, and the U.S. exchange rate was 5.34375, an increase of 0.046875 and 0.0625 respectively compared to the previous day.

Hong Kong Releases U.S. Exchange Rate

In the early morning, the London exchange rate was generally flat for the near term and down 0.0625 for the far term. The New York silver price remained flat, the London raw gold was fixed, and the exchange rates for British versus U.S. dollars, Shanghai, etc. were flat. The U.S. dollar was unchanged against the British pound, slightly up by two dimes and one cent against Shanghai, and there was no market for the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot sales prices, with British gold at 3.243715 and the U.S. exchange rate at 5.28125, the same as the previous day's informal market price. It was later learned that an external company had made a deal for the current month's U.S. exchange rate at 5.28125, but when they went to settle it, they were only willing to pay 5.25 yuan. HSBC's listed price was announced to be unchanged, the silver tax was flat, and a telegram from Hong Kong came saying that the current month's U.S. exchange rate was received, totaling 5.28125 from Huahang American Bank, reaching 3125, and HSBC also sold the next month's U.S. exchange rate to a certain American bank, easing to 5.3125, so speculators followed suit, and the current month's U.S. exchange rate strengthened to 5.34375. There were no transactions for shillings. By the noon close, the market was still stable. As a result, the spot shilling was quoted at 3.40625, and the U.S. exchange rate was 5.34375, an increase of 0.0625 compared to the morning opening price.

The Market Continued to Ease in the Afternoon

In the afternoon, speculators sold a lot of U.S. exchange rate, causing the market to be softer than the hard closing at noon. It is estimated that a certain American bank and Youli, etc. bought the current month's U.S. exchange rate from speculators at 5.375 yuan. Later, China Banking Corporation also bought the current U.S. exchange rate from speculators at 5.375 yuan, but soon the speculators' sales were exhausted, and the situation turned slightly softer again.

### Gold Market Wild Surge and Plummet: Highest at 6950 Yuan, Bulls Exit and Market Declines Rapidly

Yesterday, the gold market, originally intensely hot, suddenly changed. It first surged and then suddenly reversed into a decline. After leaping over the 6,900 yuan mark, it retreated to around 6,800 yuan. It is said that this was due to the exchange rate softening under the pressure of speculators selling millions of US dollars. In the early morning, continuing the previous day's upward momentum, buyers ignored the high prices and rushed in, pushing the price of cash forward transactions to a high of 6,950 yuan. This was only 300 yuan short of the unprecedented high of 7,250 yuan on May 6th of last year. However, as news of the exchange rate softening spread, the trend of bulls exiting the market began. Securities firms like Defu alone sold more than 3,000 taels, and Tongkang, Dafeng, Xinfeng, Chengda, Hengji, Rencheng, and Yongxinyuan also fiercely sold. Furthermore, it was heard that China Bank was selling foreign exchange for arbitrage, causing the price to plummet to within 6,800 yuan. In the afternoon, it saw a low of 6,775 yuan before finally rebounding slightly to 6,802 yuan, a small decrease of 43 yuan. According to the settlement price of US dollars for the coming month, it was 6,615 yuan, an increase of 187 yuan. Transactions amounted to 12,300 taels. For deferred transactions, buyers for February were offering a premium of 120 to 220 yuan, but there were no takers. The cash price in the morning was 80 yuan lower than the forward price, quoted by silver shops such as Yelesheng Gold Shop. In the afternoon, it was 100 yuan lower, and there were buyers. Prices for gold ornaments and customs gold remained stable.

Fluctuation of 175 Yuan

In the early morning, due to the softening of foreign exchange, the price per bar (ten taels) had already risen to 6,880 yuan by 9:15 am, 35 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. It then slightly retreated to 6,860 yuan. As the US exchange rate softened to 9.25, confidence was boosted, and amidst a unified and chaotic buying frenzy, the price rose to 6,950 yuan. Seeing this high, securities firms like Defu and Tongkang began selling, and news that China Bank was selling foreign exchange for arbitrage made the market even more volatile. Dafeng, Xinfeng, and Gongda also sold, causing the price to decline by 140 yuan to 6,810 yuan. Hengji, Tianyuan, and Tongkang absorbed the selling, causing a rebound back to 6,890 yuan. As the foreign exchange rate was reported to be softening, the selling pressure intensified. Rencheng, Chengda, Tongkang, and exchange brokers repeatedly sold, causing the price to fall another 110 yuan, entering the 6,800 yuan range. At noon, it was even weaker, closing at 6,780 yuan. The afternoon session opened 10 yuan higher at 6,790 yuan. Gold shops and silver shops came in to buy, pushing the price up to 6,830 yuan. Suddenly, news broke that US dollars for the current month could be settled at 5.375, and Chengda, Defu, Xinyuan, and Deda started selling heavily, causing the price to drop sharply by 55 yuan, retreating to 6,775 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange rate stopped softening, the price also rebounded to around 6,800 yuan due to buying by Gonghe and others covering their short positions, even reaching 6,820 yuan. However, under the selling pressure from exchange brokers, it retreated to 6,785 yuan before rebounding again. The market closed at 6,802 yuan at 4:00 pm, a small decrease of 43 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous evening. The daily fluctuation was 175 yuan. The selling price of spot gold by cash shops was about 50 yuan lower than the forward price, and they had to deduct 100 yuan when buying. There was no change in the spot gold margin price.

Silver Shops Maintain Original Prices for Gold Ornaments

The selling price of silver shop gold jewelry remained at 690 yuan per tael at Datonghang and Xintonghang, with no change. The purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan, it was said.

### Foreign Currencies First Rise, Then Fall Back

Yesterday's foreign currency market initially saw prices rise rapidly, then turn down. British and American gold pounds also rose first and then fell back, ultimately each declining by one yuan compared to the previous day. British gold notes remained stable as before, with the market price leveling out. American gold notes initially rose to 18 yuan 9 jiao 3 fen, but then fell back, ending at 18 yuan 6 jiao, a final decrease of 1 jiao 5 fen compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise. Supply and demand for Japanese gold notes and Korean currency remained balanced, with the market price leveling out. The former remained at 1 yuan 5 jiao 8 fen 5 li, and the latter remained at 1 yuan 2 jiao 2 fen.

### Food: Both Arrivals and Orders of Foreign Rice Are Strong, Speculation Creates Rumors but Recedes Yesterday

After the previous sharp rise in the foreign rice market, at the opening of the market yesterday morning, buyers were still hoarding and insisting on higher prices. As soon as there was an inquiry, prices soared. Many buyers also held the same mentality, so the market once stirred, and prices rose steadily. Small Jiao even opened at 77 yuan, but eventually the bubble burst, causing buyers to feel overwhelmed. Moreover, foreign firms were throwing out large quantities of forward contracts, and new arrivals poured in continuously. It is said that no less than 600,000 to 700,000 bags would arrive in January and February, causing some concern. In an instant, the situation eased, and the market became stagnant. Seeing the opportunity, sellers knew that high supplies meant danger and that holding on was useless, so they successively lowered their prices. However, the market was not only sluggish, but people were also losing confidence. No matter how loudly they shouted, it was like wind in their ears. Therefore, in an instant, the price fell back to its original level. Small Jiao was sold at 75 yuan, and the overall market gradually stabilized. The closing price for Saigon No. 1 was 85.6 yuan, No. 2 was 81.5 yuan, Ba Shang Yuan was 80.5 yuan, Siam No. 1 was 84.5 yuan, No. 2 was 78.3 yuan, and 77.8 yuan, Huojiao was 85 yuan to 83.7 yuan, Small Jiao was 75 yuan, Broken Pointed Rice was high from 67 yuan to 60.5 yuan, and Rice Tea Special was 70.5 yuan to 70 yuan. However, the repurchase market was very active. Saigon No. 1 for January opened at 95.5 yuan, February at 93 yuan, Small Jiao January 16 opened at 85.5 yuan, January 2 at 87 yuan. Later, January 16 fell to 84 yuan. In new transactions, foreign firms were offering March contracts that had not yet been finalized. Nearly 1,000 tons of repurchase goods were traded, and nearly 10,000 bags of spot rice. Today, 1,500 bags of corn were shipped to Yantai.

Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica, followed the trend of foreign rice, first tightening and then weakening. As a result, due to the limited arrivals, the opening prices were half a yuan to nearly a yuan higher than the previous market. Chang Bang Special Japonica was seen at 107-108 yuan per dan, Kunshan Japonica was seen at 105 yuan to 102-103 yuan, and Qingjiao was seen at Thin Rice 98.8 yuan, 98 yuan per dan.

After a period of activity, glutinous rice sales were dull yesterday. However, sellers were unwilling to let go easily, so the market remained flat. Li Yuan opened at 90 yuan, and Hong Kong at 178 yuan to 175 yuan.

### Flat Sale of Flour to Cease - New Measures to Be Determined Next Spring -

The flour market was initially firm yesterday, then flat. The market opened in the morning, continuing the previous day's momentum, and the situation was quite lively. Everyone was optimistic, influenced by rumors about gold, foreign exchange, and Ningbo bonds. The selling price of Hua Wu and Zhonglou brand Australian flour had reached a peak of 24.7 yuan, and sellers were unwilling to let go easily. However, later, due to the softening of the gold and foreign exchange markets and the leveling of rice prices, speculative buyers slightly decreased. Beautiful Brand opened at 24.75 yuan to 7 yuan, then softened by 1 to 2 jiao. The Hua Flour Factory price remained at 21.5 yuan, with 4,000 bags sold by the two factories. The flat sale of flour will generally continue until the end of the lunar year, and new measures will be determined next year.

The wheat market was firm as usual. After brokers from other provinces sold small amounts of high-quality wheat at 36.3-4 jiao, confidence was further boosted. With both arrivals and inventory scarce, holders raised prices at every turn, while Chinese and Japanese factories were not eager to buy, so the market entered a firm and quiet state again.

### Securities: B, C, and E Government Bonds Surge

The over-the-counter market for government bonds, after days of consolidation, was expected to have a strong upward potential and would have to go through a considerable period of detours before reaching a high of 70 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, it suddenly experienced a fierce surge. Class C bonds reached a new high of 69.4 yuan, and all other types also hit new records. However, Class E and Class A bonds were cheaper than other types because Class A included interest and lottery winnings, and Class E was more than 1.1 yuan cheaper than Class C. Currently, the prices of all types of bonds have seen a very strong rise, and the prospects are still bullish. The stocks of various companies and firms have mostly risen above face value, while government bonds are still below 70% of face value. Due to the difference in market prices, all brokers rushed to buy them, especially those in the financial sector. In the morning, the trading of various brokers was relatively stable. In the afternoon, the trading atmosphere suddenly became strong. Hongda and Tongkang No. 16 were the most active, and Datong, Xie Kang, Runde, Jiucheng, and Le Mao started to cover short positions and follow the trend. Class C bonds were seen approaching the highest record of 70 yuan to 69.4 yuan, and all other types also saw new highs, soaring without end. Although Yongchang, Yizhong, Shenchang, Jiufeng, Renchang, and Yitai either saw bulls exiting the market or bears adding to their positions, the supply still could not meet the demand. As a result, all prices rose by 5 jiao to 1.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 3.56 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 50 shares of Zhongyi Trust Company stock were traded at a price of 17 yuan each.

The stock market for public utilities saw more profit-taking, but the trend was extremely stable, and price fluctuations were minimal. There was a large volume of trading in industrial stocks and rubber stocks.

London, 16th (Thursday): Today's market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks saw bank stocks continue to rise. The stock of Mercantile Bank rose 2 shillings 6 pence to 8 and a half pounds. The stock of HSBC London Registered shares continued to rise 1 pound to 82 pounds, and the stock of Hong Kong Registered shares continued to rise 2 pounds to 85 pounds. There was a market without transactions, and all other prices remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Initially Rises, Then Weakens

The yarn market initially rose, then weakened, but the trend was slightly挫折 [frustrated]. This was because the rise had been large in recent days, causing those with profits to exit the market. Secondly, the rise had been too sharp due to rumors, and the courage of new buyers had slightly weakened. However, the general psychology was still bullish, so the market remained firm. In short, the base has already been high, and a reaction must be guarded against. The peak price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,459 yuan, and the low price was 1,433 yuan. In the afternoon, it first traded at 1,439 yuan, then at 1,433 yuan. Shenxin Factory opened 900 bags of 20-count Double Horse at a price of 1,450 yuan.

Due to the strong performance of foreign exchange and gold in the afternoon of the previous day, the Double Horse market opened in the morning with confidence boosted, and speculators rushed out, shouting higher prices. The opening price was 1,450 yuan. However, some, due to the high prices, sold, causing a slight drop to 1,445 yuan. Subsequently, the margin price opened and the foreign exchange rate still shrunk, and the buying momentum was even stronger, rising again to 1,450 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain amount of large sums of money took advantage of the chaos in the market and exited the market one after another, so it slightly loosened. However, general bulls still held on tightly, revolving between 1,440 yuan. By the close, due to the decline in the margin price, the market followed and fell to 1,434 yuan. Statistics show that 6,460 bags were traded in half a day. The amount of bags purchased by each broker is listed below.

Colleagues 5,620 Hong Kong 780

Wenzhou 60 Statistics 6,460

### Spot Cotton Situation is Clear and Firm

The spot cotton situation is more firm and expensive, but the factory's acquisition appetite is not very strong. However, colleagues see the foreign exchange rate shrinking and think sharply. Thus they have already purchased spot cotton. Therefore transactions are more lively. However, the Indian cotton supply continues to come and the amount arriving in Shanghai is huge.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to sales in New Orleans and then due to weak stocks on Wall Street. In total the price was lower by about 5-6 pounds compared to the previous day's closing price. Indian cotton was slightly weaker. Yesterday's transportation forecast was less by 1 and a half robbies.

Yesterday, the foreign cotton trading market in Shanghai rose again due to the continued decline in the wine exchange rate. All parties' intentions turned higher. All those who held spot goods were unwilling to sell them because they were deeply afraid that it would be difficult to hedge after selling. The factory's desire to purchase remains strong but it is not easy to find sellers.

### Piece Goods: Fine Cloth Is Uniquely Expensive

Yesterday, the trend of factory cloth was slightly soft. The morning opening inherited the previous day's momentum. Spot goods were tight and sellers were unwilling to sell. There were a few brokers who were actually selling, raising the price by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece, such as Dapeng fine cloth at 42 yuan and Fugui fine cloth at 41.75 yuan. In the afternoon, the market slightly loosened and there were a lot of turnovers. The sales disk returned to a 2.5 jiao decrease. As a result, coarse cloth was stable, twill rose 2.5 jiao, and fine cloth was the most firm and expensive. The prices of bleached and dyed cloth and grey cloth were stable. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Zhejiang Dong Wenyong brokers bought more than 100 pieces of line呢 [line ne],府綢 [fu chou], color cloth, and bleached cloth. Fujian and Guangdong brokers bought more than 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse cloth, and twill. More than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, color cloth, etc. were bought by Yantai brokers from the North Road. Also, today 720 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin and 85 pieces were shipped to Yantai.

Dongbu first rose and then fell. Longtou fine cloth opened in the morning at 46.3 yuan. Later the spot market retreated and retail investors sold. Prices gradually trended downstream. Later, due to the good outlook of colleagues, the sales disk was tight again. The closing price was 45.3-4 jiao, a drop of 5-6 jiao per piece. Due to seasonal reasons, the transaction of four gentlemen's serge was very clear. The afternoon opening price was 1.25.5 yuan.

### Oil Cake: A Large Quantity Arrives From a Certain Party, Bean Cake Suddenly Plummets in the Afternoon

Since oil cakes have been used as a football by speculators for many days, the price has become higher and higher. The initial opening price yesterday was 1-2 jiao higher again. A certain party secretly transported a large quantity of soybean cakes exceeding 100,000 pieces. This news was only revealed in the afternoon, which greatly disappointed the people in the market. As a result the price suddenly became weaker. The result was a drop of 2-3 jiao compared to the previous day.

### All Industries and Labor and Management Interact Sincerely: Labor Disputes Have Gradually Been Resolved, Most Barbershops Reopened Yesterday, Garbage Collectors Request Wage Increase

Telegraph Bureau Messengers' Conditions of Negotiation Have Shown Promise

The city's barbershops caused a strike due to the issue of profit sharing between craftsmen and shop owners. A small number of striking craftsmen coerced workers from shops in the British and French concessions who had not participated in the strike to join the strike, resulting in beatings and destruction of objects in the shops. The police arrested them and sent them to court for prosecution. The details of each situation have been recorded in various newspapers in recent days. Since this incident occurred, personnel from the political departments of the police stations in the two concessions have been dispatched to mediate and persuade the workers to resume work first, and then discuss and negotiate the conditions. The workers in the French Concession shops have followed the advice and most of the shops have opened and resumed business yesterday morning, waiting for the authorities to discuss and resolve the matter with labor and management. It is reported that the capital has agreed to a 4-6 profit-sharing system in this labor dispute.

New Clothing Stores Closed Yesterday

More than 150 new clothing stores in the two concessions, with a total of more than 500 employees, proposed the following conditions to the shop owners under their joint names on the 13th of this month due to the impact of expensive rice and salaries and difficult livelihoods: (1) Increase wages by 50%, (2) Increase the morning snack fee from 1.5 yuan to 6 yuan, (3) Extract 3% of Yang Li per yuan, (4) No dismissal of workers without reason, etc. Because they did not receive a satisfactory reply from the shop owners, it caused dissatisfaction among all the workers. As a result all of the workers declared a strike together yesterday morning. All of the new clothing stores in the city were unable to continue operating and temporarily closed.

Tobacco Exchange Industry Employees Make Demands

The city's Tobacco Exchange Industry Association has more than 3,000 members, with a total of 25,000 employees. However, the monthly salary is extremely low, with the highest being no more than 100 yuan and the lowest being only 2-3 yuan. At a time when rice is expensive and prices are skyrocketing, it is difficult to maintain even personal livelihoods. In order to request a raise, it is heard that the majority of workers in the industry have decided to submit proposals to the capital at the same time and are also planning to organize a Tobacco Exchange Industry Employees Association.

Commercial Labor Disputes Are Still in Contact

After the Commercial Press Association sent a telegram with five suggestions to Hong Kong, it received a telegram from Hong Kong on the 15th. The original text said, "I understand the telegram. The company's approach this time is for the livelihood of most colleagues. There is only this one way out. Rice subsidies have been maximized and cannot be changed. I hope you will reply after consideration, Yunwu." The Association immediately replied, hoping that each of the five suggestions would be answered and sincerely considered. But there has been no reply to date.

Garbage Collectors Reduce Work

The English Da Mei Evening News said that today (17th), messengers from three major foreign telegraph companies are also going on a go-slow, and sanitation workers in the French Concession may also go on a go-slow. It is heard that a small number of cobblers are currently on strike in the city. As for the strike being brewed by the sanitation workers in the French Concession, it is being negotiated this morning. These workers have reduced their work and have requested wage increases and special rewards.

Mail Carrier Bonus Department Telephones Immediately

Also, messengers and tea attendants from Da Bei, Da Dong, and Pacific Three Telegraph Companies have been on strike since 4 pm yesterday (16th). It is said that consultations will be held this afternoon and the labor dispute may be resolved tomorrow (18th). The request made by the Bureau of Posts employees in this city has been replied to today by the Ministry of Communications of the Central Government in Chongqing, promising to issue bonuses at the end of the old lunar year. The Postal Service is not at risk of a strike. There has been no change in the Da Mei Evening News labor dispute today. The striking workers have not yet returned to work, but it is hoped that a resolution will be reached in the short term. Also, the messengers and tea attendants of HSBC Bank are still on strike today, but it is believed that their request will be approved.

### The Eighth Period of Cheap Rice Sales Ends Early, the Ninth Period of Cheap Rice Sales Will Continue

The eighth phase of cheap tribute rice sales organized by the Shanghai Rice Price Stabilization Committee has been proceeding well since it began on the 7th of this month at 60 locations in the two concessions. Each location sells 50 bags of rice per day, for a total of 1,500 bags of rice per day. According to the association's report yesterday, only 20,000 bags of rice were shipped in advance for this period, and the missing 2,500 bags could not be shipped in time. The rice prices have been stabilized for this period and are scheduled to end early on the 19th of this month. As for the ninth phase of cheap rice sales, the association plans to start in the spring of the lunar calendar, but it requires a lot of money and awaits the continuous transmission from all industries to work together for a good cause.

### Travelers to Hong Kong From Next Month Must Have Visas, the Current Flexible Measures Will End at the End of This Month

The Hong Kong British authorities previously promulgated population entry restrictions in order to prevent unscrupulous people from entering the territory. It has been implemented since the 14th of this month. Passengers traveling to Hong Kong must have a certificate issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Bureau before being allowed to land. However, most passengers traveling to Hong Kong recently were unable to rush to obtain passports, so a temporary flexible measure was taken to pay security deposits of HK$100, $50, and $25 depending on the cabin class. According to a reporter from Ping Ming News Agency, who inquired with the aviation industry, this flexible measure of the Hong Kong Immigration Bureau will be abolished at the end of this month. After that, passengers traveling to Hong Kong will be prohibited from landing without a visa. Also, anyone holding a passport issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and approved by the British Embassy or Consulate can freely enter Hong Kong without the need for a certificate from the Immigration Bureau.

### Banks and Money Shops Conclude Total Settlement and Agreed on Measures

### The Military Affairs Commission Thoroughly Investigates the Shanghai Comfort Money Association, Which is Clearly Setting Up False Names for Fraud and Deception

Chongqing, 17th: The Military Affairs Commission has received reports that the so-called Anti-Japanese and Guarding Headquarters and Comfort Money Recruitment Committee in Shanghai claim to have been filed with the National Government and the Military Affairs Commission, and have been ordered by the Comfort Association to raise Comfort funds in Shanghai. After investigation, it is completely inaccurate. It is clear that unscrupulous people are setting up false names, deceiving, and profiting from it. It has been telegraphed to Shanghai for a thorough investigation.

### Thirty-One Organizations Hosted a Banquet for Dr. Baker, Each Organization Praised Dr. Baker's Work, All US Aid to China Funds Will Be Replaced With Goods

Thirty-one charitable organizations and public bodies in this city hosted a public banquet at the Hongmian Restaurant on Edward Road at 7 pm last night to welcome Dr. Baker of the United States, who has been in Shanghai for more than ten days, to express their respect and friendship. More than 120 representatives from all parties, both Chinese and Western men and women, attended. Dr. Baker was full of energy, wearing glasses, and his hair was greyish white. At first glance, he was a person full of enthusiasm and courage. He was very happy to be among the crowd, talking and laughing frequently. Photographers asked Dr. Baker to sit on the sofa with Wen Lanting to take a group photo. Mr. Wen had a beautiful beard and an elegant demeanor, while the doctor had a benevolent and chivalrous air reflected in his eyebrows. In this hall, where everyone gathered together, it was like two stars shining in the sky. As the host was all there, they took their seats.

Dedicated to Disaster Relief

Halfway through the dinner, Yang Yongqing, the president of Soochow University, gave a speech welcoming Dr. Baker to the meeting. Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludun then gave short speeches, one in Chinese and one in English, representing the various charities present and toasting Dr. Baker. After the cheers subsided, the chairman invited Mr. Bosad, the president of the Chinese Department of the American Red Cross, to speak. His words were humorous and pleasant, because Mr. Bo and Dr. Baker had worked together for many years and knew him very well. In addition to praising his old friend's work as rare, he ended with a joke. The audience laughed. Mr. Bo said: "A black child used a phone in a pharmacy one day to call a famous doctor in the city, saying that he was willing to work for him, washing cars and wiping boots. The doctor replied that the old servant was still there and there was no need for it at the moment. He said, 'Maybe another day.' The phone was hung up. The shop owner told the black child that he might be able to help him if he wanted to specialize in work. The child laughed and said that it was not necessary. I am the doctor's servant. This move is just to test whether my master is satisfied with my work." Bosad looked at everyone at the seat and said, "Dr. Baker is here in Shanghai at this moment, and I think he is also testing whether his charitable work is satisfactory to all parties. I can guarantee that Dr. Baker will not be able to find a new position." The audience laughed.

Mr. Baker's Reply is Modest

Finally, Dr. Baker stood up and gave a speech, first saying that he did not dare to accept all the praise from all parties. "Many hands make light work. All the achievements are not the result of one person's efforts." At this point, Dr. Baker used a football game as a metaphor. His words were concise and to the point, and the audience was moved. He said that the number of the relief funds allocated by the American Association for the relief of various invaded countries and数 [shù] which China could obtain could not yet be said. However, this time the relief funds will be completely replaced by goods. All goods that are not prohibited for the US defense plan and are surplus in the country can be purchased to replace relief funds. Once approved by the Ministry of Finance and Agriculture, there is no problem. For example, quinine is also needed in the United States now. The fifteen tons shipped to China this time were purchased by the American Red Cross. As for the distribution of future relief funds, the American Red Cross is divided into two parts in China, East China and West China. After accepting requests from all parties and considering them, it can also cooperate with all parties to obtain the most practical use.

Sympathy for General Zhu Ziqiao

In his report, Dr. Baker also mentioned General Zhu Ziqiao, who recently passed away in Xi'an, saying that in 1930, in Shanxi, after the ravages of bandits, the people were living in misery, and General Zhu did his best to transport money into the disaster area and complete the expected work. His perseverance and enthusiasm cannot be matched by a second person. I think that today, all of you who know General Zhu will say that I am telling the truth. At this point, it was already 10 o'clock. After the host and guests drank the last cup, they dispersed. It is heard that the only doctor will go to Hong Kong within the day and is expected to arrive in Chongqing, the capital, before the end of the month.

### Flat Flour Supply to Continue

Flour mills cooperate with the Bureau to maintain food supplies for the people. It is recently reported that over 200,000 bags of Australian flour, in a single shipment, were blocked en route and cannot arrive in Shanghai within the expected time this month, causing the market price to rise again. The city's steamed bun, pancake stalls, bread, and sliced noodle businesses are being supplied with this flour at a flat price. Since Deputy General Manager Ho of the Public Works Department negotiated with the Fu Feng and Fu Xin flour mills to continue the supply until the end of the Lunar New Year, the period is less than a month away. Now, the price of foreign flour

rises again.

The ban on the export of domestic wheat remains in place, and the Fu Feng and other mills face a shortage of raw materials, and are about to take early vacations and stop work. The flat flour supply after the Lunar New Year may be interrupted, so there are many requests for the Public Works Department to relieve livelihoods and maintain the original plan for flat sales. However, according to sources close to the Bureau, the flat flour supply is being negotiated with the two mills by Deputy General Manager Ho, and progress is going smoothly. According to the flour mills, they are very willing to continue to cooperate with the Bureau and promise to disclose the pricing of foreign wheat, liquor tax, and machine labor, only seeking to maintain costs, and still

continue flat sales.

Therefore, Mr. Ho is commended for the assistance of the two mills to the Public Works Department in maintaining food supplies for the people, and a special letter of gratitude has been sent to the managers of the two mills. Last year, all industries had huge profits, but the flour mills' due profits were all sacrificed in the flat sales (the difference between the flat sale price and the market price is three yuan). This act of public service and righteousness is admirable. It is hoped that the giants of all industries in this city will act bravely when they see righteousness, and not let that industry alone get the honor.

### Detained Goods in Vietnam to be Returned, Registration Begins

Since the news of the return of the detained goods of various industrial and commercial firms in this port in Vietnam was published, all parties concerned are greatly gratified that the Vietnamese government can consider the friendly relations between the two countries in this extraordinary period. It is found that the goods have been detained for more than two months, and the losses of all parties are already considerable. Now that they can be returned, personnel must be sent to Vietnam as soon as possible to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities on transportation procedures and goods matters. However, because there are too many detained goods, and some have been confiscated by the Vietnamese customs, it is not easy to handle without first registering the goods themselves. Moreover, sending personnel to Vietnam is quite costly, and this work cannot be completed without collective efforts. Therefore, 301 on the third floor of the Edward Road Gauze Exchange has been selected as the registration office. Yesterday, a public notice was published in the newspaper for all relevant industries to go to register as soon as possible. The fee is ten yuan per ton, with a limit of three thousand to five thousand tons. The registration date is until the end of this month.

### Mr. Zhang Yunhe's Memorial Stele Unveiled Yesterday, Ceremony Simple and Solemn, Meaning Profound

Yesterday was the first anniversary of the death of Mr. Zhang Yunhe, former chief editor of this newspaper. His colleagues in this office, in view of the fact that Mr. Zhang served in this newspaper for thirty-six years, and devoted his life to it, erected a statue and planted a stele as a permanent memorial, and held an unveiling ceremony in the editorial department on the third floor at 3:00 pm yesterday.

Unveiling Ceremony

At 3:00 pm, all the colleagues of this newspaper gathered in front of the memorial stele on the third floor, offering fresh flowers, incense, fruits, and a copy of the newspaper of that day. The ceremony was simple and solemn. The program was: (1) Ringing the bell to start the meeting; (2) All stand at attention; (3) Hold the unveiling ceremony; (4) Bow three times; (5) Chairman's speech; (6) Family representative's thank you; (7) Ceremony completed; (8) Adjournment. The unveiling was done by Chairman Wang Yaoqin. All the colleagues respectfully admired Mr. Zhang's posthumous portrait, and were all respectful, and remembered the past sages.

Memorial Stele Inscription

The memorial stele inscription was written by Feng Duliang, editor of this newspaper, and written by Chen Taoyi. The inscription is as follows: When the Shen Bao was founded for more than twenty-nine years, Mr. Zhang Mogong of Songjiang actually praised the pen administration, and devoted himself to his work, tirelessly day and night. After years of traveling, he became a model. Mr. Zhang's name was Baoyuan, his alias was Yunhe. He was born with a natural intelligence, and was gentle and kind. He had a clear character, and his learning was well-cultivated. His integrity was enough to save the times, and his generosity was enough to bring peace to things. His arguments were fair and upright, neither radical nor humble. He adhered to the principles of ethics, and never made any mistakes. He dispelled the darkness and enlightened the people, and the people's voices were never betrayed. His achievements were dedicated to this, and he was already diligent. His nature was humble and retiring, and he rarely set up cliffs. He treated others with sincerity, and was only considerate. Therefore, the people were touched, and the top and bottom were in harmony. For six years, there was no change. His health was always poor, and his eyes were always tired. He accumulated love and hard work, and it was impossible to support him. He had vertigo and was unconscious. He resigned and returned home to protect himself, and he was always anxious. Every time he met Qingming, he also ordered Xingli to stop, and summoned his former companions to express his affection. Although he opened his divine seal, his words and colors were pleasant. If he was not devoted and determined, and his morality was unwavering, he could not have been able to perform his duties so thoroughly and completely. The heavens did not bless him, and he lost my good man. On January 17th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, he bid farewell to his Shanghai residence, at the age of sixty-seven. The spiritual light suddenly disappeared, and there was no standard to look up to. The snow was sad and tears were hidden, and all the officials grieved together. They all said that with Mr. Zhang's virtuous voice, how could he be allowed to be silent? If there is no record, how can we express our intentions? I have made a golden image and engraved it on the wall of the museum, and made a praise to decorate the bottom. I hope that the glorious deeds will be greatly promoted, and will be comparable to the past sages, and the beautiful style will be preserved, and will be a model for future generations. The words are: Tight heavens, only my public, sorrow for the wise, open the abyss, Shen Dayuan, Xi Shi Yong, pen like a rhino, gas like a rainbow, exhausted Ersi, Zha Juegong, exhaust heart, to Xiuyong, meaning Kai Che, degrees include Hong, Dunhua Yu, Wen Yigong, broadcast for teaching, covered by the wind, consult many scholars, Mo Wu Cong, virtue is rich, life is not integrated, not in Shou, Ju Gaozhong, Shao first order, step on the ruins, bandits after people, who will succeed, think about the slightest, tears Meng, Cai Yingju, Chou and Tong, Fan Yixiang, Juan Zhugong, Zhi Yonghuai, Nian Wuqiong, the Chinese Republic of China in September of the 29th year, the entire group of Zhongbao respectfully offered.

### Tightening of Foreign Exchange Listing Succeeds in Combating Arbitrage. Market Situation Stabilized Yesterday Afternoon. Legal Tender Stable, Domestic Debt Not Affected

The black market finance in this port fluctuated violently the day before yesterday and yesterday morning. For a time, the black market exchange rate tightened and gold rose. However, by yesterday afternoon, the market had stabilized, gold had fallen back, and the black market exchange rates of the United Kingdom and the United States had also risen in unison. A Ping Ming News Agency reporter inquired about this matter to authoritative sources in this port. It is learned that the reason for the fluctuations in the black market finance in this port the day before yesterday and yesterday morning was that the Japanese side again competed to climb the foreign exchange rate with legal tender, especially the Japanese textile industry, which was a large amount. As a result, the black market行情趨緊. However, the reduction in the supply of foreign exchange listing by HSBC Bank the day before yesterday gave the Japanese side a major blow to arbitrage, and had no impact on the legal tender itself. The foundation of China's finance is stronger than it was two years ago, and the fact that domestic debt has not been affected is the most powerful proof.

Gold Rises Sharply, Exceeds Normal

The black market exchange rate did not tighten sharply the day before yesterday and yesterday morning, but the highest peak of gold once reached 6,940 yuan, which is actually beyond the norm. The gold price converted from the black market exchange rate should not be so high. It actually exceeds its converted market price by about 270 to 80 yuan. This is due to the control and manipulation of the gold market black market. However, after yesterday afternoon, the black market exchange rate has risen back and gold has also begun to fall. This kind of change will definitely gradually stabilize. As for the miscellaneous notes that have not been approved, their issuance volume is limited by the facts, only a few million yuan, which is not enough to affect the financial market.

Overseas Remittances Increase Significantly, Economy Abundant

There are millions of Chinese compatriots overseas, and the amount of money remitted back to the motherland from overseas every year is quite amazing. The Japanese attempted to weaken China's economic power and spared no effort to destroy the foreign exchange of overseas compatriots. Fortunately, the National Government had already paid close attention and effectively prevented it, and persuaded overseas compatriots to hand over remittances to state-run banks or their entrusted banks for underwriting. Therefore, remittances from overseas Chinese have not decreased after the war, but have increased. The amount of money remitted back to the motherland by overseas Chinese in the United States in the 29th year has reached more than 35 million yuan. Calculated at the current foreign exchange market price, the total amount has exceeded 700 million yuan, which has exceeded the total amount of 60 million yuan in overseas remittances in the 28th year. It is heard that remittances from overseas Chinese are mostly used to develop industrial construction factories in the rear.

### Japanese Nishikawa Meets President Dai in Airplane, Nishikawa Feels Very Uncomfortable, Dai Remains Calm as Usual

The Mainland News reports that the Japanese "Mainland News" in this city reported that on November 1st of last year, Nishikawa, a councillor of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was arranged by "fate" to take a British regular passenger plane from Yangon to Calcutta, and saw that the person sitting opposite him was Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan of the Chinese government, and his entourage, who also took the same plane. According to Nishikawa, President Dai was a gentleman, dignified and about five feet tall. After recognizing Nishikawa as a Japanese official, he remained calm and composed. Nishikawa himself spent five hours in an extremely embarrassing atmosphere due to the unexpected incident. After President Dai and his entourage arrived in Calcutta, they were warmly welcomed by the local newspapers and received by the authorities with the courtesy of a state guest.

### Public Works Bureau's Finance Committee Recommends Increasing License Fees (Continued from Yesterday). License Fees Account for One-Eighth of Regular Income. New Fees Include Last Year's Surcharges

Bread

and confectionery shops, some bakeries, are quite developed. The current fee is nine yuan for half a year, which seems inappropriate. In the future, it is proposed to collect 24 yuan every half a year for every 500 square feet of their workshops. This new method only applies to places where bread is baked, to show that it is different from other small shops that bake pastries and candies for on-site consumption.

Food Category

(A) Cold drink food stores and rice stores (see categories 1, 2, and 3 of the Public Works Bureau's "Other Foods" license). This type of license is related to the retail of main items, so the fee is not intended to be changed, but the fee for manufacturing ice cream should be revised. The method is detailed in the appendix. (B) Manufacturing of various prepared foods and soda water (see categories 4, 5, and 6 of the Public Works Bureau's "Other Foods" license). The fee is intended to be revised, as detailed in the appendix. (C) Ice factories. At present, the fee for ice factories and cold storage is from 6 yuan to 60 yuan every half a year. In the future, it is proposed to collect 45 yuan every half a year for every 500 square feet of their workshops.

Private Vegetable Market

There are currently only five such vegetable markets. The current fee schedule is still appropriate and will not be modified. Private slaughterhouses, the fee remains the same. Laundry shops, the fee remains the same. Clothing stores, the fee remains the same. Food hawkers, the fee remains the same.

Vehicles

A. Private and rental cars. It is found that the above fee currently only accounts for a very small part of the vehicle maintenance fee. In the past three years, the amount used for vehicle maintenance has increased threefold, so it is appropriate to increase the fee. In the future, various motorcycles will be charged double according to the current fee schedule (including surcharges). As for motorcycle trailers, car dealers, vehicle registration, and driver's licenses, the same should be done. B. Trolleys. The issue of increasing the trolley license fee is very complicated. On the one hand, it is necessary to consider the damage to the road surface and the obstruction of car driving. On the other hand, it is necessary to take care of the livelihood of the car drivers. After detailed discussion, it is believed that the trolley fee is currently relatively low and should be increased by 60%, and a new fee schedule for rickshaws should be formulated based on this standard. C. Small carts. There is no need to encourage the driving of this type of vehicle, so the fee should be doubled. D. Charter cars and car driver's licenses. This type of fee is borne by the car owner. In the future, there is nothing wrong with doubling the fee. E. Public rickshaws and car driver's licenses. The Public Works Bureau has restricted rickshaw rentals, so the current rickshaw and car driver's license fees are not intended to be changed. F. Horse-drawn carriages (public and private horse-drawn carriages and stables). The driving of horse-drawn carriages is no longer in line with the times, and there is no need to encourage them, so the fee should be doubled. G. Bicycles. It is found that this type of vehicle aggravates traffic congestion and the police's performance of their duties, so the fee should also be doubled. H. Delivery tricycles, etc. This type of vehicle should also be charged double like other vehicles.

Ships, the current fee is not intended to be changed.

Dog raising, the dog raising license fee is currently 7 yuan and 50 cents per year. In the future, it is proposed to increase it to 12 yuan.

Exchange

shops. It is found that this type of fee can originally be collected from 1 yuan to 140 yuan according to the approved fee schedule, but it has not been used. At present, the fee is from 1 yuan to 21 yuan per quarter, plus a surcharge. The Committee believes that in the future, there should be a distinction between shops that specialize in Chinese currency transactions and those that operate foreign currencies. The business of the former has been inferior to the past, while the latter has a wider scope and better business. However, how to estimate the new fee is quite difficult. It is not possible to determine the fee standard according to its business income or its capital. As a result, it was decided to take the storefront opening as the standard, that is, for stores that operate foreign exchange, a fee of 120 yuan per quarter will be charged for every 12 feet of their storefront, while other exchange stores will be charged a small fee of 3 yuan or 6 yuan per quarter depending on their location.

Gold and silver jewelry stores. This type of business is currently inferior, so the fee is not intended to be changed.

Pawnshops. The current fee is collected according to their business income, which is quite appropriate and should not be changed.

Tobacco Shop

It is found that tobacco is a luxury item, and the fees are quite heavy in other places, so the fee for tobacco shops should be appropriately increased. At present, there are 2,300 tobacco shops in the Public Concession. The scope of their business varies in size. According to the investigation, the profit of each shop is 15% to 20%. The selling price of each tobacco is limited to the regulations of the industry association, and there is no major difference in most cases. After careful consideration, it was decided to determine the fee standard according to its location. The methods are as follows: 1. Those facing the road, 30 yuan per quarter; 2. Those not facing the road, 18 yuan per quarter.

Firearms, etc.

A. Carrying and storing firearms. The fee for carrying firearms licenses is intended to be doubled. As for storing firearms, in order to encourage registration, the fee is not intended to be changed. B. Insurance vests. The current fee for the transportation and manufacture of insurance vests is 700 yuan per year, and the fee for selling them is 250 yuan per year, both excluding surcharges. It is intended to remain the same. As for those who hold or wear this kind of vest, in order to encourage registration, the fee is also not intended to be changed.

Other

Other industries such as factories, pharmacies, brothels, and lotteries, etc., have not been considered due to the Public Works Bureau's consistent or recently announced policies. The license method for using celluloid has been recently implemented in order to manage this dangerous business. The current fee is still appropriate and should not be changed. In addition, the fee for storing dangerous goods will still be collected as before.

According to the above report, it is the first section of the report of the subcommittee. The content is to discuss and revise the current methods for various license fees. The various suggestions mentioned in the report, except for a small part, have all been adopted by the Public Works Bureau and announced on the 6th of this month. The work of the subcommittee has not yet been fully completed, and the second and third sections of the report will be submitted successively before the annual meeting of taxpayers. (End)

### Swedish Consul General Changes

The English Great American Evening News reports that Mr. Preber, First Secretary of the Swedish Legation in this city, has succeeded Cronvall as chargé d'affaires and acting Consul General, responsible for the affairs of the Swiss Legation and the Consulate General.

### Spaniard Big, Specializes in Gambling in Shanghai, Police Department Strictly Arrests

The Mainland News reports that the Public Concession Public Works Bureau ordered the Police Department to clean up the gambling dens in the concession in recent months. The Police Department sent detectives to investigate everywhere. It was learned that a foreigner was running a gambling den in Room A, No. 85, Deyi Building, Jing'an Temple Road.

Sudden Search Was Conducted

However, the gambling den had received the news and moved the gambling equipment in advance, so the police only captured the Portuguese Kexavier and others who were in charge of the gambling den, and handed them over to the Portuguese Consulate and other authorities for punishment. According to informed sources, the purpose of the police's continued investigation is to arrest the

Spanish

named Big who opened a gambling den on Difeng Road, opposite the Fire Brigade in the Public Concession, and his two assistants, who are all Spaniards. Big studied at the Public Works Bureau's Western Boys' School in his childhood, and went into business after graduation. He would report unemployment and live by borrowing. During the Shanghai War in 1937, he engaged in political activities and profited a lot. Now he is privately running a gambling den in the Public Concession, and is known as the "Gambling King of the Public Concession". He is rich and, on the surface, a legitimate businessman.

Quite Powerful

and Status, the gambling den set up in Deyi Building made a profit of more than 40,000 yuan a week, so he is unwilling to give up this lucrative business. However, in order to eradicate gambling crimes, the Police Department of the Public Works Bureau decided to collect evidence and arrest Big and bring him to justice, and would never be lenient because of his status and power.

### Zhifu Road Blood Case, Egg Shop Owner Killed, Three Murderers Broke into Egg Shop, Two Shots in Vital Parts

(Ping Ming News Agency) Zhao Jifang, the owner of Renji Egg Shop, No. 205 Lane (i.e. Jifeng Lane), Guizhou Road, Zhifu Road, Public Concession, also known as Afang, a native of Shaoxing, 44 years old, lives at No. 77, East Siwen Lane, Xinzha Road. Unexpectedly, at about 2:30 pm yesterday, Zhao was sitting on the account table in the egg shop, when three uninvited guests suddenly broke into the shop, took out a pistol, and fired two shots, both hitting the vital parts of the head, killing him on the spot. The murderers saw that their purpose had been achieved, and fled in unison. Later, someone called the gang catcher and quickly reported to the Lao Zha Patrol Station, which drove a police car to the scene, but the shooter had disappeared. He quickly summoned an ambulance to carry the body to Renji Hospital, and then to the autopsy office, waiting for the court to send personnel to investigate. The deceased was wearing a Huadani jacket, a black camel robe, and black leather shoes. It is learned that two people went to the shop the day before yesterday afternoon, but Zhao was not there. The tragic case happened yesterday. Based on this speculation, the murderer has been plotting to kill Zhao for a long time. According to Zhao's family members, Jifang was kind and friendly to people and had no feuds. However, he had a Cantonese mistress who rented a house on the upper floor of a hotel on Kad Road. It is feared that the occurrence of this case is related to a love affair.

### Kidnappers Did Not Know How to Drive, Factory Owner Fortunately Escaped Danger, Three Batches of Detectives Rushed to Rescue After Hearing the Alarm, Three Kidnappers Abandoned Hostage and Fled

Shen Haitao, a resident of No. F1, No. 1955 Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, has been running the An Tai Iron Factory at No. 48, Yaoshui Lane, Little Shadu Road for many years, and his business is very good, which has been coveted by bandits. Shen has a black-licensed private car, number 5097, and hired a driver named Shen A'gen, 30 years old, a native of Ningbo. At about 9:20 am yesterday, Shen planned to go to the factory. Just as he was stepping into the car, two kidnappers surrounded the car, both holding pistols. Fortunately, the driver Shen A'gen was alert and immediately managed to brake the new-style brake of the car, and shouted that the car was damaged, and then jumped out of the car. However, one of the kidnappers was good at driving and hurriedly got into the car to drive, but failed. At that time, after Shen got out of the car, he ran into a neighbor's house. The house was equipped with a police bell, and he quickly reported to the Jing'an Temple Patrol Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to drive to the scene. The kidnappers abandoned the hostage and fled in unison because the car could not drive forward. Both the people and the car were safe, but Shen Haitao had suffered a false alarm.

### An Overview of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Important Administrative Work Over the Past Year (1)

Last year, no war occurred in this port. Although the resumption of normalcy continued to be hampered due to the Sino-Japanese war, the ability to restrain latent political difficulties was ultimately rediscovered. Crimes and terrorist incidents were numerous, and how to curb them was a major issue. At the beginning of the year, the Chairman of the Council and the Director-General were attacked by thugs on a road outside the Settlement. Fortunately, they escaped unscathed, but the perpetrators have not yet been apprehended. Subsequently, political assassinations occurred frequently. On July 20, the Chairman of the Council sent a letter to the Consular Body, requesting assistance in suppressing the rampant spread of such crimes. In response, the Consular Body urged the Council to comprehensively consider the situation in this port and make every effort to crack down on terrorist acts in order to maintain security within the Settlement. According to the Consular Body, the most appropriate method to crack down on terrorist acts was close cooperation between the various police agencies in this port. The Chairman of the Council then sent letters to the French and Japanese Consuls-General and the late Mayor Chuan Xiao'an, inviting them to a meeting at the Council to discuss this matter specifically. The French Consul-General was unable to attend due to business, but sent a senior police officer to attend and listen. As a result of the meeting, it was unanimously agreed to convene regular meetings of the heads of the affiliated police agencies, hoping to discuss cooperative methods to prevent terrorist incidents at these meetings. Subsequently, the heads of the various police agencies have held meetings on schedule, and are still continuing.

Police Agreement

On February 16, the Council and the Municipal Government signed a temporary agreement on police authority in West Shanghai, stipulating the establishment of a special police force in the area outside the Settlement in West Shanghai. Some important officials would be recommended by the Council and appointed by the Municipal Government. Cases involving foreigners would be handled by foreign police officers recommended by the Council and appointed by the Municipal Government. As for the implementation of the above agreement, negotiations are still ongoing. Currently, the situation in which police officers from both sides perform their duties in the area remains unchanged. Last year, the Japanese army continued to occupy the area north of the Suzhou Creek, but cooperation with the Council's administrative aspects has improved. At the same time, the procedures for entering the northern area have also been relaxed. As a result of long-term negotiations between the Council and the Japanese authorities, an agreement was signed in March of last year, stipulating that police authority in the area north of the Suzhou Creek would be returned to the Council, and a new police district would be established in the area, with a Japanese officer appointed as the district chief. The above agreement has not yet been implemented.

Allocation of Defense Zones

In August, due to the withdrawal of British troops, the issue of reallocating defense zones arose. On the 15th of that month, the Shanghai Defense Commander held a meeting and decided by a majority vote that the defense of Zone B, which had been garrisoned by British troops, would be taken over by the American army. Part of Zone D, which had been garrisoned by British troops, would be taken over by the Japanese army. The Japanese representatives opposed the above arrangement and reserved the right to propose another plan. The Council, in addition to expressing its approval of the above arrangement, also reserved the right to consider other plans. It was finally decided that the American army would postpone taking over the defense of Zone B, pending the outcome of negotiations between the United States and Japan. All defense of the area would temporarily be taken over by the Volunteer Corps. (To be continued)

### Xiqing Basketball Holds Great Promise: Huaxing Defeats Mailinbai; One Point Decides the Victory at 33 to 32; Military Officers Decisively Defeat Little Bears Last Night

Huaxing achieved another great victory in the Xiqing Basketball League last night, defeating strong rival Mailinbai by a score of 33 to 32, creating an undefeated record of five wins in five games. The one-point difference that decided the victory, the excitement during the game, and the tension of the situation can be imagined. The scores of the two teams rose and fell like rabbits and falcons, and the victory was not decided until the last minute. In the first half, Huaxing trailed by five points at 17 to 12. In the second half, they gradually caught up, and when they exceeded the score by three points at 24 to 21, Li Zhenzhong was fouled out again. However, Huaxing ultimately relied on the collective efforts of the team to achieve the final victory. In the game between Military Officers and Little Bears, Military Officers decisively won by a score of 45 to 24. In the first half, Little Bears trailed by a huge margin of 20 to 10. Currently, the only teams that remain undefeated are Huaxing and Military Officers.

Scores Rise and Fall, Difficult to Separate

The Xiqing ball court was packed with spectators, and cheers thundered. Under the whistle of the referee Bora Tuo Quhonglu, the game between Huaxing and Mailinbai began. Li Zhenzhong received the ball and shot from a distance, hitting the bullseye. Qin Jinssi shot under the basket, tying the game. After that, both sides made no achievements, and Bao Songyuan missed many shots, and the score remained tied for four minutes. Ren Xiangcheng unfortunately fouled, and Henggeer made one free throw, thus exceeding the score. Bao Songyuan also got a free throw opportunity and scored, tying the game at 3 points each. Xue Chong made a free throw, and Songyuan shot a reverse layup, exceeding the score again at 6 to 3. Qin Jinssi slapped the ball in, and Li Zhenzhong made one free throw, and Ding Huaer made a basket for the first time, tying the game again at 7 points each. After that, Mailinbai's momentum greatly increased, and with free throws and shots, they took a remote lead with 15 to 7. At the end of the first half, Huaxing worked hard to catch up to 12 to 17, still trailing by five points.

Surprising and Thrilling Final Victory

After the break, Xue Chong made two free throws, and Li Zhenzhong scored under the basket, making the score 16 to 17. Xiangcheng made a reverse layup, taking the lead at 18 to 17. The audience cheered loudly. At this time, Mailinbai Meihan shot, and Hongbin scored, with the difference only one point. The scores rose and fell at times, which was one of the tense scenes of the night. After Hongbin and Xiangcheng each scored two points, they stabilized the chaotic situation at 24 to 21. However, the good times did not last long. Zhenzhong was judged to have committed four fouls and was sent off the field. At this time, there were six minutes left in the game, and the score was 31 to 24. Everyone was worried about Huaxing. As expected, Li Zude replaced Li Zhenzhong, and the formation was loosened, and Mailinbai scored four goals in a row, immediately making the score 32 to 31. Mailinbai led by one point. Seeing that the situation was not good, Huaxing used all their strength. Wang Hongbin shot from a distance and hit the bullseye, making the score 33 to 32. The statutory time ended, and Huaxing thus used this precious one point to defeat Mailinbai and maintain their undefeated record.

### The Price of Ridicule

— Ou Li

A most famous mother in America is named Canton. Due to her virtuous upbringing, her three sons and one daughter have all achieved outstanding success. The eldest son, Carl, is the president of the Maryland Institute of Technology; the daughter, Mary, is the principal of a school in India and the wife of a university president; the second son, Wilson, is a renowned economist; and the youngest son, Yade, is an immortal figure in the scientific community, the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics.

Once, this wise mother said, "Parents often ridicule their children's thoughts, thinking they are foolish, forgetting that in the children's eyes, those ideas are not foolish. When Yade was ten years old, he wrote an article arguing with other experts about why some elephants have three toes and some have five toes. He brought the article to me, and I almost couldn't help but laugh. But I knew he was serious, so I sat down and helped him write the article."

Speaking of this, Yade interrupted, "Mom, if you had laughed at me that day, I think you would have laughed away all my interest in studying science." Yes, such a light laugh might have caused the world to lose one of its most outstanding scientific talents.

Later, Yade's parents bought him a small telescope, and he was so happy that he forgot to sleep, using the telescope to observe the stars in the sky all night. That night, if his parents had ridiculed him like the neighbors and hadn't let him look at the stars all night, perhaps the world wouldn't have had such a contributing scientist.

The price of ridicule is sometimes very high.

### I Protest

— Song Xuezhen

I am quite fond of silence, and I can endure the greatest insults from others; but now I want to protest. I don't want others to always hide and make beautiful dreams, I want others to open their eyes and take a look at the dark side of this society.

I am a young woman who graduated from middle school. After stepping out of the school gate, my family could no longer afford my educational expenses; but I am not afraid, I have courage, and I decided to use my own strength to make myself a valuable person who can earn my own living.

Yes, I understand, I understand that female employees will be despised by others, but should a person with a correct consciousness waver in their beliefs because of others' base distortions of the facts? I believe that accepting money earned through one's own efforts is not shameful. I don't care if others use terms like "vase" to insult me, I only ask that my soul can have a peaceful and pleasant feeling; so I became a female employee.

Now please listen to the little stories that I have personally experienced or seen after becoming a female employee.

Of course, I understand that we employees should use a smile to accept the gazes of any customer in terms of courtesy, but is this possible? No. This not only causes misunderstandings among customers, thinking that we are "affectionate girls," but also male colleagues will seriously say that we are using "smiles" to attract customers, trying to win the boss's favor. So we put on a serious face, and we answer one question when others ask one; this is certainly unpleasant, but it is not comfortable for us to make ourselves so stiff!

That was when I was just a female employee serving in the cosmetics department. Once, a young man in a suit who looked like a college student came to buy cosmetics, pestering me for a long time asking for this and that, and finally bought a bottle of perfume. But he had no intention of leaving, and he kept staring at me; I turned my head away; he suddenly patted my shoulder and said, "Give you this bottle of perfume..." I couldn't bear it anymore, I said, "What do you want?" He said with a hippie smile, "Why are you getting angry?" I stepped inside, farther away from the counter, and ignored him. Sir, do you know what he said in the end? He said, "What's so great about it? You can't even afford to buy rouge with just these few wages! Who are you fooling? Huh, if you don't work as a dancer selling your body at night, how can you survive?" He left, but I felt sad for days because of my first insult. I knew that female employees would be looked down upon, but I didn't expect that the status of female employees was so low in the eyes of others.

Sometimes the manager graces you with a conversation. When your colleagues see you, they act as if they've seen a ghost. As soon as you enter the manager's office, they all run away, which they consider "knowing what's good for them," giving you space. Afterwards, they are respectful to your face - as respectful as they would be to the manager's wife, but behind your back, they are jealous of you, hate you, and resent you; this is a conversation I heard with my own ears: "Her, she's hooked up with the boss..." "Naturally, without some special relationship, how could her salary be increased so quickly?"

In fact, the manager's attitude is also a bit unbearable; of course, that is considered "lifting you up" in his mind. I am not saying that the manager should not maintain a kind of politeness with the female employees, but he seems so serious and proper in public, and when he is alone with you, his face is full of smiles, showing a "lustful" face, what is this for! He never asks you a word about business, he starts by asking if you are married, then talks about your hair... until your shoes. How I dare not hope that the manager will favor me! I dare not say that all the managers who hire female employees are asking to find "comfort" in the female employees, nor do I want to say that they are all using our "business eye" by exploiting the weaknesses of customers' psychology, but I cannot prohibit thinking that way. If those big bosses who hire female employees are really holding the purely noble goal of promoting the social status of women, I think even they themselves would blush.

To be honest, others consider places where there are female employees to be "marriage agencies" or "comfort stations." But this strange phenomenon of discrimination against female employees, I say is only caused by the pathological psychology that believes that women cannot do things, and that selling their "bodies" is the only reliable profession for women.

Yes, I have now told you about many of my embarrassing experiences, but don't think that I have lost courage and started to back down. No, I won't, I just hope that you don't always hide and make beautiful dreams, but open your eyes to see more. I will fight on, for myself, for the future of the entire women's world; I want to let others know that women are also people - people with souls who can do things.

I Want to Be Speechless

The other day, US Secretary of State Hull delivered a righteous and stern speech against militarist countries. When the local German radio station reported the news, it said, "Leaving people speechless."

Rice Weevil

According to Western newspapers, rice weevils have been found in the rice stockpiled in local warehouses. The Municipal Council is paying close attention to this matter and is sending people to investigate the truth in order to formulate countermeasures. Incidentally, there is also a kind of "rice weevil" in the market. The Municipal Council may as well send someone to investigate as well.

(2) Good Friends and Prostitutes

The clock struck nine. It was the time when wealthy people were in those Western restaurants filled with the smell of foreign yams, as well as all kinds of Chinese restaurants, having drunk enough wine and eaten their fill of meat, slowly picking at their teeth with a toothpick, discussing how to grind away a good night. That evening, although flurries of light snow had fallen from the sky, and the northwest wind was blowing very hard, the Zhengyanglou, where the fire stove had been lit and the warm curtains hung, with a temperature at least twenty to twenty-five degrees higher than outside, was still packed with people eating mutton hot pot, both upstairs and downstairs. Only three guests remained at table number four - two had just left - and everyone was smoking cigarettes, sitting contentedly next to the table piled high with empty dishes.

"Your uncle is in high spirits! As soon as he finished eating, he eagerly sent Boss Qiu to the restaurant again." A thin, tall man sitting facing east raised his eyebrows and cornered eyes, his face full of unnatural smiles, and said to a young man sitting to his right.

"He's just naturally like that," the young man replied, exhaling a puff of smoke.

"When Yuan Zhenshou was in Beijing, probably..." The butt of the cigarette, less than half an inch long, was about to burn the thin, tall man's two opium-stained yellow fingers, but he still didn't seem to mind. However, what he was about to say was suddenly interrupted by another young man sitting across from him.

This was a fashionable figure dressed in a light gray striped suit, everything buttoned up very neatly, his hair combed very smoothly, and a burst of perfume constantly exuding from his body, clearly telling people that this was an inexperienced young master.

"Brother Shaowen, I was just about to ask you: why did Xiao Wu suddenly change her stage name to Qiu Haitang [Begonia], a strange name?"

"There's probably some meaning to it," the thin, tall man seemed to blame him for interrupting his speech, and immediately showed a contemptuous look, saying loudly in a rebutting tone: "What else would a Huashan opera singer use besides this kind of flowery name?" (12)

### Aphorisms on Cultivation (15)

Justice resides in the hearts of the people, and this is absolutely true. However, in the world, justice is often overwhelmed by distorted arguments, and justice is never seen to be promoted. This is not because justice cannot overcome distorted arguments, but because those who know justice do not have the courage to uphold it, and justice succumbs in a short time.

### After Seeing "Xi Shi"

— Zhou Lengjia

Fragrant carriages and Bactrian camels on verdant grass,
Dreaming of Guan Wa Hall with special intimacy.
If fair hands could influence grand strategies,
Then green hills would certainly belong to beautiful women.
In Wu Palace, they just spoke of eliminating Yuanba,
While in Yue State, they already heard of killing important ministers.
This idea is the same throughout history,
Five Lakes shimmer with no master day after day.

The above poem was written by the master of Posuo Residence upon hearing that Xi Shi was to appear on the silver screen. Time flies, and now this large-scale film, which took nearly three years and cost 500,000, has finally met us at the Grand Light and Nanjing Grand Theaters. Here, I would like to write down some of my personal opinions after watching this film.

Director Bu Wancang's artistic skill is what I admire the most. I think he, along with Ying Yunwei and Fei Mu, can be said to be rare and outstanding directors in modern China. In the past, with story themes that were difficult to develop, such as "Humanity," which used drought as a background, he was able to handle them without making the audience feel dull and boring. In a good subject matter like this Xi Shi, he should be able to better demonstrate his artistic talents.

However, what I regret very much is that the director failed to fully grasp the theme in this film and failed to develop the theme's activeness. In terms of the theme of this film, it should undoubtedly be to awaken the public, so that they understand that the interests of the country and nation are higher than personal interests, and that complacency is enough to mislead the country, pleasure is enough to destroy the body, and that regeneration and education can eventually inspire heroism. Although the director paid a considerable amount of attention to the activeness of this theme, he ultimately seemed to overemphasize the romance between Fan Li and Xi Shi. Of course, this is excusable in considering the audience's preferences, but one should not only cater to the audience.

In grasping the theme's activeness, I feel that the point of regeneration and education is very important. It should strive to fit the current environment, inserting a few scenes of burying oneself in hard work and striving for construction, such as every family studying and every household engaged in farming and weaving. This is in line with the way of ten years of regeneration and ten years of education. To avoid taking up too many shots, the method of continuous "sweeping through" can also be used.

### Marlene Dietrich the Second

— Si Hua

Marlene Dietrich, the famous German star who played aristocratic girls in "The Devil is a Woman" and jewelry thieves in "Desire," is one of the actors who has consistently maintained her fame and high status in Hollywood for many years. Now she plans to become a teacher, naturally not a teacher in a school, but preparing to teach her fifteen-year-old daughter to appear on the silver screen, earning a bright future and becoming Marlene Dietrich the Second. The little girl's name is Maria Riva, and her father's name is Sieber. She once showed her face in "The Scarlet Empress," playing the childhood of Empress Catherine. At the beginning of the film, she had very few scenes and acted very unnaturally. The one playing Empress Catherine was her mother.

She is a girl with a square face, light yellow hair, and an expression that is usually unemotional. According to news from Hollywood, she has inherited at least some of her mother's characteristics and expressions. At the same time, she is still extremely shy about filming. For many years, Marlene Dietrich has not allowed her daughter to have the opportunity to approach Hollywood. Whenever she has free time, she takes her on vacation trips to Europe. This may be the main reason for the child's timidity on the silver screen. But now she has overturned the ancient history recorded about how a beautiful mother is jealous of her growing daughter, and is happy to do her best to make her a star. With Marlene Dietrich's superb acting skills and rich experience, it is not difficult to influence her daughter to succeed and become famous on the silver screen. In a few years, we will see Marlene Dietrich the Second from that acting family on Hollywood's new star throne.

In terms of actors, Wang Yuanlong's Wu Zixu is the best, making people able to imagine his heroic demeanor even after a thousand years. Mei Xi's Fan Li is also not weak. Yuan Meiyun's portrayal of Xi Shi seems a bit inappropriate, but her acting skills are still good. The one who played Goujian did not seem to fully portray the personality of this sinister and decisive hero.

Finally, I would also like to talk about Xi Shi's guilt. Some people think that although Xi Shi is a Yue person, since she has already married into the Wu country, according to the principle of following her father at home and following her husband after marriage, she should be loyal to the Wu country. Now, she helps Yue overthrow Wu, which is somewhat disloyal to her husband's family. In fact, this kind of statement is also overemphasizing ethical concepts over national concepts. "The country comes first." This is the same in ancient and modern times. Xi Shi's assistance to Yue in overthrowing Wu is precisely her loyalty to the monarch and love for the country, and there is absolutely nothing to criticize. Only Goujian, who "seeks the country in women and treats meritorious officials like straw dogs," is the object of criticism.

### "Spring River" Will Perform "Sunrise"

### Red Flower Congress: Prelude to "Red Flower Serenade"

Since the Fuqi Company's colorful musical blockbuster "Red Flower Serenade" has achieved unprecedented success, the Asian Cinema Company and Fox Company decided to hold the "Red Flower Serenade" dance party jointly at the Ankai Dance Hall on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of this month before the screening of "Red Flower Serenade." Produced and directed by dance expert Niya Shifu, it is gorgeous and magnificent, and completely imitates the "Red Flower Serenade" film, so it is also known as "Hollywood in Shanghai." In addition to performances, there will also be dance competitions, beauty photography contests, and various precious prizes will be prepared and given to guests. Female guests who participate in the beauty photography contest will not be charged for photography, and the photos of the winners will be sent to the Hollywood Fox Company. Tickets are five yuan per person, and a special large dish is fourteen yuan per person, including the ticket. It is heard that on the first night of the dance party, a lottery will also be held to help enhance the elegant atmosphere. The winner will enjoy a special screening of "Red Flower Serenade," allowing the winner and 30 of his or her relatives and friends to appreciate it together, but the ticket stub must be kept.

### Zhang Tai Willow

— Gu Mingdao

Shi Dakai met with Huang Yuqi and shook hands with sighs. Gathering the defeated and remnant soldiers, they retreated towards the riverbank. Who would have expected that the Qing soldiers in Zhenjiang and Jiangyin had received the alert and came to support them, just encountering Huang Yuqi's righteous army, and surrounding the righteous soldiers again, engaging in a fierce battle. Shi Dakai protected Huang Yuqi, desperately breaking through the encirclement. Although his leg had been wounded by a knife, wherever he went, the Qing army gave way, and he forcibly beheaded hundreds of people. Escaping to the riverbank, he only had dozens of cavalry by his side, and the rest had scattered. He hired three fishing boats to cross the river to the north. Just as they reached mid-stream, the Qing army had already detected them and dispatched a large fleet of warships to intercept them. Shi Dakai bravely resisted, and Huang Yuqi took the opportunity to escape to the north of the river. After Shi Dakai and Yuqi were separated, he had to escape overseas to Xiamen to join Zheng Chenggong. Huang Yuqi's uprising suffered another defeat. Several of his sons, named Dazhan, Dachun, and Dahong, all died in this battle, fighting to the death without fear. Dazhan's wife, Huang Zhou, heard the news in western Zhejiang and was determined to die as well. She was arrested by the officials and committed suicide by slitting her throat during the trial, and everyone praised her as a martyr. Huang Yuqi was alone and lonely, a survivor of the war. Although he was lucky enough to escape, thinking that Shi Dakai had been separated from him, such a hero, Liu Rushi was able to recognize him in the brothel, which can be said to be unique. However, Zuo Liangyu did not use him well. He himself also mismanaged the dispatch, and ultimately failed, burying his talent as a general. Comparing him to Zhang Huanhou and Xu Chu, the Tiger Fool, in the Three Kingdoms, he is also not much inferior. Unfortunately, I am mediocre and have failed to restore the country, greatly failing him. Fortunately, he rescued me from danger, but he could no longer be with me from then on. I hope he can break out of the encirclement, choose a tree to perch on, change his allegiance, and have the opportunity to rise again in the future. Thinking of the destruction of his family, he could not help but shed a few tears of a hero. But he was not discouraged at all, and fled to the north of the river, changing his name to Wang Mengbai, or calling himself Taibai Xingzhe, even wearing torn clothes and broken shoes, begging in the market, still looking for opportunities. Finally, he was reported by a traitor, revealing his whereabouts, and he was captured by the Qing soldiers, dying righteously without surrendering. He even wrote several poems in prison to express his aspirations. (38)

### A Striving View of Life (XI)

Striving and cutting off the retreat, always thinking of sounding the gongs to withdraw troops, preserving strength, and never willing to fight a decisive battle, how can one exert inner divine power and gain a great victory? Moreover, the strength of striving is based on self-confidence as the backbone. If one does not trust oneself, what strength is there to preserve?
