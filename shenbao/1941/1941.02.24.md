### Australia Already Feels Real Threat, Intensifies Preparations to Counter Aggression, Will Soon Dispatch Special Envoy to Singapore, If Japan Advances South Again, It Will Face Anglo-American Retaliation

Canberra - Acting Prime Minister Fadden stated in a speech at Manlan Baona yesterday, "Australia now has a real possibility of being attacked," and also said, "Local defense against aggression will be carried out with a necessary attitude, the real issue has arrived, and all reasonable steps must be taken to deal with it." He also stated that Australia is willing to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries. It was announced that over the past thirteen months, the number of Australians who have joined the Royal Australian Air Force has reached 60,000. Furthermore, Australia's defense has been extended to Malaya, and elite Australian troops have landed there this week. Therefore, a special envoy will soon be dispatched to Singapore.

The Australian troop commander stated that the style of combat training received in Malaya is different from that received in Australia, and he is confident that they will be able to undertake any defense work within a week. (Reuters, 23rd)

Singapore - The head of the intelligence bureau, Pan, gave a broadcast speech last night, stating that if Malaya or its allies are attacked, Malaya will fight back. It is said, "We are not as hesitant or divided as Japan. We only know that if we or our allies are attacked, we will fight. Japan's so-called encirclement is a fallacy. Germany is well aware of Japan's predicament and is urging Japan to attack Britain and the Netherlands in the Far East, because what Germany wants is to divert the strength of these two countries." He also discussed civilian defense measures and said that small leaflets on air raid precautions have been printed in English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil, describing how to deal with incendiary bombs. He advised the public to immediately prepare the necessary preventive equipment. He said, "We have been warned that when the crisis comes, we must keep our heads cool." Singapore is an extremely strong fortress, protected by artillery, troops, aircraft, and mines. Malaya also has countless British, Indian, and Australian troops defending it, so even if the greatest misfortune occurs, what worries do we have? In my view, the situation is very satisfactory.

Moscow - The Red Star newspaper wrote an article reviewing international current events, stating that British and American military preparations in the Pacific are very busy, and Japan is also actively taking military measures in Southeast Asia. Currently, the power struggle between the British-American group and Japan is unfolding in the Dutch East Indies. Japanese military authorities are eager to seize the oil, rubber, and tin resources of the Dutch East Indies. An American observer said that the measures taken by Britain and the United States in the Pacific not only help to defend the Dutch East Indies but also increase pressure on Japan, making it clear that if it advances south again, it will encounter a counterattack. The chairman of the Japan Metal Industry Association, Hirao, told reporters that if Britain and the United States impose economic sanctions on Japan, Japanese industry will suffer greatly. Currently, Japan's raw materials are largely dependent on overseas. Hirao strongly stated that Japan must improve this situation as soon as possible. Hirao's remarks fully illustrate that Japan's diplomatic actions are part of the ongoing "nerve war" between Japan and the United States. (22nd dispatch)

US Fleet to Remain Stationed in Honolulu

Washington - It was learned here last night that the current strategy of the US Navy is to keep the US fleet stationed around Honolulu instead of concentrating it in the Philippines. Senior naval circles revealed that the US Navy outpost may operate as far as Honolulu in the Far East, but the majority of the Navy will remain stationed around Honolulu. US naval experts believe that it is unwise to send the US fleet to the Philippines or Singapore to prevent Japanese action. It is generally felt that keeping the US fleet stationed in Honolulu to restrain Japan's deliberate actions against Singapore or the Dutch East Indies is a better situation than sending the US fleet to the South Pacific. According to experts, a Japanese naval attack on Singapore would make Japan and its fleet extremely vulnerable to enemy navies in the central Pacific. (International News Service, 23rd)

San Francisco - Thirty-six American fighter planes have been transported by the aircraft carrier "Enterprise" to Honolulu Harbor in Hawaii. (Havas, 23rd)

Regarding whether the US should seek British consent to use naval bases in Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand, 55 percent approve, 29 percent disapprove, and 16 percent have no opinion. The final question was "Do you think that if Japan seizes the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, US interests will be threatened?" 60 percent answered yes, and 20 percent each answered no or had no opinion.

Editorial

### How to Take the Initiative in the International Crisis

In the current complicated and dangerous international situation, the most difficult thing is the inability to grasp the focus of the development of the situation, which increases the infinite confusion and anxiety about the future. Regarding the current situation, the most concerning situation for the world recently is in the Pacific, which is also where various democratic countries have been focusing their vigilance recently. However, the Pacific issue is obviously not an independent category, and at least half of the key to its evolution lies in the trends of the European situation. To further discuss the European situation, in the past three months, the war has only developed on both sides of the Mediterranean Sea. Recent events such as the turmoil in the Balkans and Eden and Dill's visit to Egypt indicate that that corner is attracting the great attention of both warring parties. However, if the Axis powers are indeed preparing to launch an offensive against Britain in the near future, they may not choose the Balkans, which is a complex situation and lacks a decisive effect on the overall situation, as the most advantageous target. As for the Axis' future strategy against Britain, it is still a question of how to choose and use the paths of strict submarine blockade, large-scale sea landings, and expanded air strikes. Moreover, among all the possible strategies, it is difficult to make a hasty judgment as to whether the Axis will concentrate its efforts on one and only one single offensive, or will it operate both concurrently and take care of multiple aspects. What's more, nerve warfare and smoke screen tactics are tricks commonly used by today's aggressors, which inevitably add to the uncertainty.

Compared with the preparedness of democratic countries at this time a year ago, everything is obviously progressing rapidly. Although the arrangements in all aspects may not be as ideal as seamless perfection, the opportunities available for aggressors to exploit have indeed been gradually shrinking. Even in the past, except for China's brave resistance, the Far East, which was completely unprepared, has also been greatly enhanced due to the unprecedented active vigilance and increased defense of Britain and the United States, gradually reaching a state of not fearing aggression and provocation. This is certainly the result of past painful lessons, and it is something that people around the world who sympathize with democratic countries are gratified about. However, aggressors who are good at exploiting general human psychology will probably not rashly launch an attack when the other party is on high alert without absolute certainty. On the contrary, they will create various doubts and disguises to confuse people, and then take advantage of the other party's slackening of vigilance and exhaustion to launch a surprise attack. Looking at the past, the Nazi leader was the most skilled person in this type of strategy, and the Japanese are also imitating him step by step. The extreme chaos of the current European situation and the superficial relaxation of the Pacific situation are both due to the application of this strategy by the aggressor front. They still maintain the initiative and the situation, which can be proved by the existence of the term "Spring Offensive," and it is also the main reason why the world is difficult to grasp the future of the situation. In the democratic countries, although their current defense lines have expanded to almost half of the world, and although the British army's offensive in North Africa, the Middle East, and other places has achieved significant success, from an overall perspective, it has only exerted the qualities of a defensive posture.

In terms of military principles, offense is the main action of war, and offensive is the main form of war. In other words, giving play to the meaning of war and completing the mission of war must at least be tied to an offensive in the final stage of the war. As for defense, it is either a strategy in the middle of the war process or a step before reaching the final stage. To further analyze, in addition to using the offensive in the final stage to determine victory, it is often necessary to adopt an offensive as much as possible in other stages in order to easily maintain the strategic initiative or strive for the initiative, which is to grasp the advantage. Although the advantage depends on strength, it also depends on the offensive and defensive strategies. The initiative is the ability to freely exert intelligence and freely control power to choose the most favorable timing, goals, and actions for oneself. Based on the above-mentioned reasons, we can understand from its opposite side how unfavorable it is to be stuck in a defensive posture in war. If the other party is quiet, they will be worried and on guard in many ways. If the other party moves, they will be eager to respond and exhausted in running around. In short, they will be in trouble. The disastrous defeat of the Anglo-French allied forces last spring, in addition to the reasons for the strength of the troops and the war equipment, the strategy of Gamelin's stubborn defense of the Maginot Line should bear a major responsibility. Furthermore, in the Sino-Japanese War, China had to use the strategy of exchanging space for time because of the disparity in strength, but it never stuck to it. In the past three and a half years, none of the battles with significant achievements was due to the strategy of mobile warfare, which is also a flexible combination of offense and defense. As for the current international war situation, the trend of the rise and fall of the strength of both sides is certainly the strengthening of the democratic countries and the weakening of the aggressors. However, until now, the initiative of the Axis front cannot be broken simply by applying pressure and trapping them, and its confusing and uncertain future offensive is still a pressure that the democratic countries and people with a sense of justice around the world feel both spiritually and practically. Because of this, it must be admitted that more and better weapons of nerve warfare fall into their hands. Not only can the world's vision be disturbed to dazzle, but even the great powers may be troubled by them at times. If they are not careful, they can easily be deceived by the tricks of attacking in the east and striking in the west. Therefore, those who are currently tasked with stopping aggression, in addition to striving to increase their strength and intensify their vigilance, should also quickly and actively plan to obtain the initiative. Time belongs to the democratic countries, and victory belongs to the democratic countries, but if they do not take the initiative early, the space gained by the aggressors through continuous expansion will be enough to reduce or even offset the value of time for the democratic countries. Victory is an absolute belief, but procrastination is the insidious enemy of the victors!

The democratic countries have already accepted the challenge of the aggressors and entered a state of total war. The aggressors' actions are no longer tentative peeks, nor are they local and accidental launches. Therefore, it is not enough to simply repel the invasions they have already launched; it is not enough to simply prevent and contain the offensives they are planning. How can surgery only apply antiseptic agents and allow the existence of ulcers? How can one be satisfied with temporarily slowing down the progress of the ulcers? We must fundamentally eliminate all the harmful status quo and sources in order to ensure world order, ensure human peace, and promote civilization and increase well-being.

### Japanese Solution to Thai-Vietnamese Dispute Rejected by Vichy Government: Vietnam's Strategic Military Location Could Influence the Entire Situation; Ceding 40,000 Square Miles of Land Is Too Great a Loss; De Gaulle Opposes Being Forced to Abandon Any Territory

Vichy: Authoritative authorities here today stated that the French government rejected the Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border war, which was sent from Vichy yesterday afternoon. It is claimed that the Tokyo mediator's plan sacrifices a quarter of French Cambodia. The cabinet met on Friday to study it, deeply feeling that France could not accept it, and decided to reject it. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)

Vichy: The cabinet held a state affairs meeting yesterday, spending most of the time reviewing the situation in the Far East, especially the situation in Vietnam. The reason is that Vietnam's geographical location is at the intersection of the defense lines of various countries. Therefore, if a conflict occurs in the Far East in the future, Vietnam will undoubtedly be the center of the conflict. The British Far East defense line starts from the upper reaches of the Mekong River, that is, the border between Myanmar, Yunnan, Vietnam's Tonkin, and Thailand, and extends to the American Samoa Islands. The Commonwealth of Australia and India are the population centers of this defense line, and Hong Kong is the outpost of the defense line. This line is partly on land and partly at sea, stretching for thousands of miles like a rainbow. One of the most important sections is northeast of Singapore. The analysis is as follows: (1) The north side of the port is the Burmese border, where 40,000 troops have been concentrated to protect the road to India, which is the famous Burma Road. As for the military status of Singapore itself, the port is already very strategically important in terms of terrain, and it has been further strengthened by the British construction of strong defensive works. The troop strength stationed there in peacetime is only 50,000, but now some Australian troops have been dispatched to reinforce the defense, and the air force strength of the port also has 1,200 aircraft. (2) Southeast of Singapore is the Dutch East Indies. The Netherlands was an ally of the United Kingdom in the current European war and had fought against Germany side by side. In the Far East, it can also provide significant assistance to the United Kingdom. Although the number of troops stationed in the Dutch East Indies is small, they are well-trained and have strong combat effectiveness. Its naval strength should not be underestimated. Surabaya in Java is an ideal naval base, especially for submarines. Under these circumstances, in order to counter the United Kingdom's intensification of its strength in the Far East, Japan had to dispatch a large number of army and navy troops to Southeast Asia. According to British sources, Japan currently has four divisions stationed in Taiwan, because Taiwan is the bridge between Japan's mainland and Hainan Island and Tokyo, which is easy to praise and run. At times, the military is cruising in the sea. In the United States, the strength of the garrison on the Philippine Islands has been greatly enhanced, and the number of military successors belonging to the Asian team has also increased. The above is a glimpse of the military deployment of the major powers in the Far East today. Vietnam is among them, and its position is very subtle. This is why the French Council of State must conduct a thorough review. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

Vichy: Representatives from France, Japan, and Thailand have been negotiating in Tokyo for many days. The Thai representative recently revealed the content of the country's demands on Vietnam, which is that Thailand demands to obtain the territory on the left bank of the Mekong River, which is unacceptable to the French side. The Japanese representative then proposed a compromise plan, advocating that Thailand obtains the following areas: (1) The bag-shaped area formed by northern Thailand and the right bank of the Mekong River; (2) The Pakse area on the right bank of the Mekong River; (3) Parts of Laos and Cambodia, that is, areas under the jurisdiction of Vietnam since 1907, with a total area of 40,000 square miles. After carefully studying this compromise plan, the French government believes that further negotiations are still needed. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

Vichy: After Lieutenant General Decoux, Governor-General of French Vietnam, convened the highest military conference in Saigon, there was much speculation about Vietnam's future attitude and position in the Far East crisis. Well-informed sources here recently stated that France has the responsibility to protect the integrity of its administration and sovereignty over its Far East colonies and its colonies elsewhere in the empire. In other words, if the French colonies are subject to foreign aggression, France should defend them. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

London: General de Gaulle, leader of Free France and head of the French Territory National Defense Council, recently published an article saying that the temporary disaster encountered by France should not be a reason for other countries to undermine France's territorial integrity or France's rights around the world. Any abandonment of French territory forced by the Vichy government or its representatives will be regarded as invalid by the National Defense Council. The above statement was issued in response to the Vietnam incident, and it stated that the French Territory National Defense Council does not despise agreements that reconcile the interests of Vietnam and other countries, but any transfer of rights obtained by force or threat undermines the land or political position of Vietnam when the armistice agreement of June 23, 1940, was implemented. Free France can never be regarded as reasonable. The National Defense Council now declares that it approves of Vietnam's attitude against this kind of invasion. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)

Chongqing: Reliable sources today said that the French cruiser "Barima Ki" and two submarines recently arrived in French Vietnam from North Africa. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)

Tokyo: Hanoi. Semi-official sources said that the French side in Vietnam is now preparing for war. Vietnamese Governor Decoux has issued orders to local officials in Tokyo, stating that in view of the impending danger, they must prepare to deal with all possible incidents. All strong men are ordered to prepare for possible mobilization of civilian defense, and report the existing storage of food and agricultural products. It has been reported that all are being sent to a certain base near Saigon. It is also reported that French military supplies are being rushed from Haiphong to Hanoi every day.

Since the 10th, the Japanese troops in Guangdong Province, with a force of more than 5,000, attached to 12 mountain cannons and 2 heavy cannons, under the cover of 6 aircraft, invaded along the 43rd Highway and the Luxi Highway. One route detoured from Xinjie obliquely out of Chini and Baini towards Guotaiwei, entering Datang, seemingly to seize the materials of Lubao. The Chinese army intercepted them separately from Daqutoutou south of Yangmei, and lured them into Lubao and the suburbs, taking advantage of the favorable terrain to counterattack. On the night of the 11th, the Chinese army killed more than 1,000 Japanese troops. Those who entered the city were completely annihilated by the Chinese army.

### Balkan Situation Chaotic; Rumors of Soviet Warning to Germany: If Bulgaria Is Invaded, the Economic Treaty Will Be Abandoned; Soviet Union Denies Facilitating Turkish-Bulgarian Agreement

Capital of Bulgaria: Reliable neutral sources state that if Greece refuses to make peace with Italy, a general offensive in the Balkans from the air, land, and sea is only a matter of time. Semi-official newspapers are now urging the people of Bulgaria to remain calm. Reliably informed sources close to the government claim that the Soviet ambassador to Germany has notified the German government that if German troops cross into Bulgaria, the Soviet Union will not fulfill the German-Soviet economic agreement signed on January 10. Also, according to unconfirmed Turkish sources, the Turkish government will go to war against Germany if German troops invade the Balkans, but only a defensive war, so that the British fleet can pass through the Dardanelles and cut off the Soviet oil supply line to Germany.

Istanbul: Foreign diplomatic circles with access to information said this morning that the Soviet Union is trying to persuade Germany to delay Bulgaria, so the tense situation in the Balkans has greatly eased. Diplomatic circles believe that Bulgaria will resist any German attempt to invade. (International News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

Moscow: The Swiss newspaper "Basler Nachrichten" published an article stating that "the Turkish-Bulgarian agreement was facilitated by the assistance of the Soviet Union." TASS recently declared with official authorization that this report is completely inconsistent with the facts. (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)

Capital of Turkey: The British newspapers expressed disappointment with the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression treaty, and responsible people here were very surprised by this, saying that this agreement cannot be regarded as a German victory, nor can it be called a British failure. Its sole purpose is to enable Turkey and Bulgaria to stay out of the war when their own major interests are not infringed. That's all. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

Panic Among Bulgarians; British to Evacuate Women and Children from Bulgaria

Capital of Bulgaria: Bulgaria is now awaiting developments. Although it appears calm on the surface, anti-aircraft guns have now been installed on the roof of the National Bank, which also shows the panic of the people. According to British observers here, Bulgaria will soon be occupied by Germany. Germany has now openly expressed anxiety about Italy's fate in Albania and believes that Bulgarian land can open a convenient door. Germany is handling the Greek issue. The rumor that pro-British suspects were arrested in Bulgaria yesterday has not been confirmed, but it is true that about 30 people have been detained by the police for unknown reasons. Bulgarian officials still deny that Germany will occupy Bulgaria, and rumors such as bridging the Danube have also been rejected. However, the people are worried about the future. According to recent news from the outside, German-erected signposts have been found on the road, but responsible parties here have not been able to confirm the news of riots in various provinces. Bulgarian newspapers widely published German reports that Greece's position is in danger and said that Germany no longer considers the Albanian war as a separate conflict between Italy and Greece. According to observers, Germany will use the landing of British troops in Thessaloniki as a reason for German troops to enter Bulgaria. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)

London: The Daily Mail reported that General List, commander of the German forward headquarters, and his staff have arrived in the village of Camkolia, 50 miles from Bulgaria. German troops have completely taken over the village. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)

Capital of Bulgaria: It has been officially announced that British women and children residing in Bulgaria will leave next Monday, and various cultural institutions run by the British here have already automatically closed. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

Rumor that Germany Made Three Demands; South Country's Troops Moved to the Border

Zurich: Authoritative sources say that German leader Hitler has demanded that the South Country remain strictly neutral in the event of any events in Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. It is claimed that Germany has asked the South Country to agree to a partial demobilization of the South Country's troops and to allow the following concessions: (1) Allow Germany to transport troops and military supplies through the country; (2) Allow Germany to build an air force base in South Chirbia near Albania; (3) Join the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance or recognize the European "New Order." According to interpretations here, the presentation of this condition is Germany's final preparation to gain a base and launch the Balkan offensive that is expected to take place. Therefore, it is the consensus that Germany will never begin attacking Greece unless the South Country meets the conditions and fully joins Germany. (International News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

London: It is widely believed here that Germany is still preparing to advance into Bulgaria in two ways. There is still troop movement in both the Romanian and Bulgarian borders, with troops in Romania moving towards the border. Based on current observations, there will be developments soon. Germany seems to be preparing a major propaganda campaign in addition to military action in order to cause concern among the Balkan countries. At the same time, German newspapers are exaggerating the opportunity to invade Britain, saying that submarine warfare will definitely defeat Britain, and aerial attacks can also achieve a lot. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)

Eastern City of Yugoslavia: Political circles here predict that the people of the South Country will react seriously to the news that Germany is building a bridge over the Danube, because the people of the South Country are quite enthusiastic in their opposition to the Nazis. The government of the South Country will definitely issue a statement of explanation to appease the situation. According to political observers, the announcement of the German bridge-building across the river is definitely related to the reaction to the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration. Both here and in Bulgaria, the general opinion is that the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration is a result of Soviet influence, and its purpose is to prevent Germany from invading the Balkans. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)

Diplomatic War Between Britain and Germany Intensifies; Eden to Go to Greece and Turkey from Egypt

Capital of Hungary: The joint visit of British Foreign Secretary Eden and Army Chief of Staff General Dill to the Middle East and Near East has already aroused significant attention here. According to various sources, Eden's future itinerary is planned to be from Egypt to Greece, and then to Turkey. Diplomatic circles here said that after Bulgaria and Turkey established a non-aggression treaty, the British side may believe that only unlimited aid to Greece can maintain its strong position in the Balkan Peninsula. In other words, the purpose of British diplomacy is to urge Turkey to remain faithful to its obligations in the Balkan Peninsula, so that it can have a countervailing effect on the Turkish-Bulgarian mutual non-aggression treaty. On the other hand, German diplomacy seems to have obtained the tacit consent of the Soviet Union in promoting the reconciliation between Turkey and Bulgaria this time. Therefore, it has created an atmosphere conducive to the peaceful resolution of various issues in the Balkan Peninsula. It is expected that Germany will speak to the Turkish government, explaining that it is beneficial for Turkey not to interfere in the Italian-Greek war. If this is not the case, the result will inevitably cause a major reaction throughout the Balkan Peninsula. Furthermore, Germany may point out to Turkey that, legally speaking, Article 4 of the British-Turkish mutual assistance treaty stipulates that when there is a need to resolve various issues related to maintaining the status quo in the Eastern Mediterranean, Turkey has the need to cooperate with the Soviet Union. Therefore, Turkey can cite this provision to refuse to interfere in the Italian-Greek war. The diplomatic war between Britain and Germany has now become more and more intense. Although Germany has won an initial victory, there will be major developments in the next few days. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

Vichy: Political commentators here said that although the Soviet Union and the Turkish authorities have made statements regarding the friendly declaration issued by Turkey and Bulgaria, the political situation in the Balkans is still very chaotic. The only certainty is that the Soviet Union has greatly benefited from this, because the Soviet Union has had very close relations with Turkey and Bulgaria for many years, and has long wanted to win over these countries. Although the Soviet authorities deny participating in the negotiations of these countries this time, the friendly declarations issued by these countries are in line with the political goals of the Soviet Union. In this way, the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans has become more substantial, and anyone who is in an antagonistic position with it will not be able to extend into the Black Sea. As for the statement issued by the Turkish authorities, although it said that the country's treaty obligations have not changed, the country's authorities seem to have the intention of reserving freedom of action. The country's chances of participating in this war will naturally be less than a few weeks ago. Although there are many alarming news on the border between Bulgaria and Romania, major military actions will not occur in the short term because the snow on the Balkan mountains has not melted. If other countries in the Balkan Peninsula are involved in the whirlpool of war in the future, the question of Turkey's participation in the war will naturally be expedited.

Italian forces made a slight counterattack, but were repelled. On Thursday, Greek forces seized a ridge at an elevation of 5,100 feet, which was equipped with defensive fortifications, and scattered the enemy forces. The Italian forces, retreating at night, were subjected to heavy Greek artillery fire, suffering many casualties and becoming even more disorganized. Greek warplanes cooperated with British aircraft in operations on Thursday night, achieving considerable success. Although the Greek air force is not large, it has achieved good results. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)

### Anniversary of the Red Army's Founding; Soviet Union Holds Award Ceremony; Strictly Adheres to Neutral Policy; Continues to Strengthen Naval Power

Moscow - Today marks the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Red Army and Navy. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded various medals to 1,883 Red Army officers and soldiers to recognize their achievements in implementing orders and training. At the same time, the People's Committee also conferred honorary titles on meritorious Red Army generals. Army Commander of the 2nd Rank, Chaiberu Chaizhi, was awarded the honorary title of Army Commander of the 1st Rank, and Aiboshengge and Pavlov were awarded the honorary title of Lieutenant General, while Jipangzhi Gusnazuo and Chiliweizhengguo were awarded the honorary title of Major General, and Yekefu Lengfu was awarded the honorary title of Artillery Major General. Furthermore, Marshal Timoshenko, the Soviet Defense Commissar, recently awarded the "Excellent Service" medal to 3,549 Red Army officers and soldiers to commend their achievements in military and political training. (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)

Moscow - Marshal Timoshenko, the People's Commissar for Defense Personnel, issued the following statement: "This anniversary of the Red Army's founding comes at a time of the most complex international situation. Countries are gradually being engulfed in flames. The Soviet Union, relying on its own economic and defense strength and the political unity of its people, strictly adheres to Stalin's wise neutral foreign policy. This policy has given us new victories in the past year. The Soviet nation has been strengthened, and the borders have been consolidated (especially the northwestern border around Leningrad. Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina have become Soviet territories, and Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have joined the Soviet nation). The Red Army possesses new weapons and capable officers. Thanks to the concern of Stalin, the Party, the government, and the entire people, the Soviet Red Army has become a great force. However, we must never be complacent and must continue to strive for new achievements. In modern warfare, all officers and soldiers should possess the spirit of enduring hardship and sacrifice. Discipline, decisiveness, and perseverance are essential for our Red Army to continue to strengthen itself and safeguard the peaceful labor of the Soviet people." (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)

Moscow - Admiral Gusnazuo, the People's Commissar for the Soviet Navy, issued a statement saying, "In the past twenty-three years, the Red Army and Navy have been closely monitoring the borders. The past year has been a year of victory for us, and the naval power has also greatly increased. Modern warships continue to increase, and the Soviet maritime warship manufacturing program has been successfully implemented. The security of the maritime borders of the socialist country is guaranteed. The Soviet fleet has also made many achievements in war training. However, we must not feel complacent about our current achievements. The Soviet naval power must continue to strengthen itself. In the current complex international situation, our navy should be well prepared so that the enemy's unexpected incidents and conspiracies cannot succeed. Naval training should closely resemble wartime operations. Soviet industry will surely achieve new achievements in the implementation of the resolutions of the 18th Communist Party Congress. In other words, in the near future, we will surely obtain sharper weapons. On the occasion of the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Red Army and Navy, I would like to extend my congratulations to everyone." (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)

### British Aircraft Soar Over French Territory Bombing Coastal Cities; German Aircraft Attack British Maritime Merchant Ships; Raider Appears in the Indian Ocean

Vichy - British and German aircraft formations were very active yesterday and today, bombing each other's territory. British aircraft soared over various ports along the French to Norwegian coasts throughout the day, successively dropping bombs on Brest, Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe, Saint-Léger, and Helder in the Netherlands. German oil depots outside Bergen, Norway, were also hit by British bombs. At the same time, the British Air Force also assisted in the fighting on the Albanian and Libyan fronts, bombing Berat and Tepelene in Albania, and German air force bases on the Italian island of Sicily in the Mediterranean. As for the German aircraft formations, they continued to attack the British mainland, especially targeting coastal merchant ships. The British ship "Sea Goose" has been attacked three times, with one ship sunk and two heavily damaged. In addition, both sides' navies are also very active. In addition to the British fleet laying mines in the Mediterranean, that is, the sea around Italy, German fleets have appeared in the Indian Ocean, sinking the British merchant ship "Canadian Cruiser." This shows that German ships are very active in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and even the South Atlantic. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

London - A British Air Ministry bulletin stated that yesterday British and German aircraft patrolled the skies near the southeast coast, with considerable activity. One enemy fighter plane was shot down, and bombs fell in areas such as East Kent, causing very minor damage. It is now known that on Friday night, British anti-aircraft artillery destroyed an enemy bomber, and another enemy bomber was destroyed near the Bristol Channel yesterday afternoon. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)

Algeciras - According to information received here, two aircraft of unknown nationality appeared over Gibraltar yesterday between noon and 1:00 PM. British anti-aircraft batteries fired at them, but without success. One of the aircraft had three engines. Both aircraft flew towards Morocco. Yesterday morning, five cargo ships, fully loaded with war materiel, were escorted to Gibraltar by several warships. Another submarine left after repairs, and a destroyer, heavily damaged, has entered the port for repairs. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

Berlin - According to news from here, in the past 24 hours, German aircraft continued to conduct maritime bombing raids, sinking three merchant ships totaling 18,000 tons, and heavily damaging two armored ships totaling 8,000 tons, and sinking one merchant ship of 4,350 tons. However, the location of the bombed ships was not specified. German long-range bombers sank a 7,000-ton merchant ship off the northwest coast of Scotland yesterday morning, and heavily damaged two 5,000-ton ships. Another group of German aircraft heavily bombed Swansea and Wales, dropping 51 tons of bombs and 578 incendiary bombs. Only two German aircraft were lost in the aftermath. According to news released by the German News Agency, British aircraft attempted to raid German territory but were forced away by German aircraft without engaging in aerial combat, so there were no losses. The German High Command stated that British aircraft carried out "disruptive" air raids on the German coast on Friday night. Except for one bomb that hit a building and started a fire, the rest fell into the sea. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)

London - Since the fierce aerial combat between Britain and Germany in August and September of last year, the British and German air forces engaged in intense combat again over the Dover Strait yesterday. Fourteen German fighter planes flew across the Kent Strait in the morning, and twenty German aircraft followed at 3:00 PM. British Spitfire planes and anti-aircraft artillery immediately responded to the attack. At the same time, a large number of British fighter planes and bombers flew like a tide over the strait, concentrating on the northeast and southeast of the Dover Strait, and launching fierce surprise attacks on Calais, Dunkirk, and Ostend. They engaged in fierce aerial combat with German aircraft over the strait. Another group of British aircraft flew into German territory and bombed the Ruhr industrial area.

### Germany Sinks British Ship Flying the American Flag; The United States Will Thoroughly Investigate; If Germany Attacks American Merchant Ships in the Future, the U.S. Will Instruct Captains to Resist

Washington - Just as news was spreading that Germans had sunk a ship flying the American flag, senior officials declared last night that the U.S. government would disregard rumors of German enemies misusing the American flag, and would hold Germany responsible for the sinking of the American ship. Senior government officials stated that if Germany "mistakenly attacked American ships, the U.S. government would arm its merchant fleet as it did during the last war and instruct the captains to resist." It was alleged that newspapers under Nazi control recently suggested that if the British frequently flew the American flag on their ships, Germany would not be responsible for the mistaken attacks on American ships. At the same time, Germany declared that the "Canadian Cruiser," a passenger ship painted with the American Stars and Stripes, had been sunk, prompting the U.S. government to conduct a thorough investigation. According to the initial reports of this incident, the U.S. government is currently investigating to fully understand the situation and then decide on a course of action. (International News Service dispatch on the 23rd)

Berlin - The German government announced last night that the "Canadian Cruiser," flying the American flag, had been sunk in the Indian Ocean. Germany seems poised to pressure Washington to thoroughly investigate the matter. The German High Command testified that the surviving sailors of the ship were all British. The German side said that it might demand that the United States actively guarantee that "such misuse of the American flag cannot be tolerated." The High Command further stated that "the sailors of the Canadian Cruiser" confirmed that the ship was British. In some aspects, the meaning of this statement is interpreted as that although not all of the ship's sailors were rescued, this portion was all saved. (International News Service dispatch on the 23rd)

New York - Neither the State Department in Washington nor the Navy Department in Ottawa have received any information about the German claim that a ship named the Canadian Cruiser, flying the American flag and bearing American markings, has been sunk. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)

Berlin - The mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, "German Foreign Policy News," commented on the sinking of the Canadian ship "Canadian Cruiser," flying the American flag, in the Indian Ocean, believing that British merchant ships dare not fly their own national flag and instead fly foreign flags. The British maritime hegemony has disappeared. Canadian shipowners must be well aware that the United States opposes foreign ships flying the American flag, but they still fly the American flag. The British intention to shirk responsibility has been proven again. Britain cannot get European countries to participate in the war and is focusing its activities in the United States. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

Bayonne Port - The French cargo ship "Guilvinec," weighing 5,000 tons, which sailed from Nantes to Oran in North Africa yesterday, was suddenly sunk by a foreign submarine with electric torpedoes 200 miles off the Spanish coast. The report points out the attacker was a British submarine. The ship's stern was damaged and it sank immediately, killing seventeen crew members. The remaining crew members were rescued by a Spanish fishing boat and landed in the Spanish port of Pasajes. Twenty-two of them arrived here today. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

Cape Town - The South African Federal Ministry of Defense has announced that the survey ship "Southern Floe" has been sunk by the enemy. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

### Britain Works Hard to Expand Shipbuilding Program

London - The British shipbuilding program is now greater than at any time during the last war, and the merchant ship construction program is also exciting. Although the German submarine war may soon intensify, British sailors will certainly maintain their efforts. The losses of British ships are limited, which shows the efforts of British sailors. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)

Uruguay - The British South Atlantic Fleet flagship "New Castle" cruiser arrived here yesterday for a forty-eight-hour visit. Fleet Commander Admiral Begram made a ceremonial visit to the Uruguayan authorities. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 23rd)

### International Anecdotes (7) Record of the Mayor of London's Inauguration During German Bombing Raids

Sir Clarkson, the Lord Mayor of London, had reached the end of his term, and according to their privilege, the citizens elected a new mayor. Thus, the energetic Sir George Wilkinson, only fifty-five years old, was elected with the support of the majority of citizens.

The inauguration ceremony of the Lord Mayor of London is one of the greatest ceremonies in Britain. Traditionally, the mayor must lead the judges, ride in horse-drawn carriages through the city, showing his power that can rival the emperor. The new mayor must also hold a grand banquet in the City Hall to entertain guests. This year, due to the war, the parade was canceled, and the banquet was scaled down to a luncheon to comply with wartime food control regulations. There was no pheasant and dove soup and gold plates, and no white wine expressing affection after the meal. The jewels on the ladies' evening gowns also had no room to be displayed. The mayor's wife should have had a boy to hold her train and six bridesmaids to attend her, like a queen's coronation, but this was also canceled.

On the day the new mayor took office, London issued an emergency air raid warning, indicating the arrival of German planes. However, Sir Wilkinson still arrived at the City Hall on time to hold the inauguration ceremony. Although complicated formalities were omitted, the solemnity and grandeur were not diminished. Prime Minister Churchill also attended in person as usual.

The citizens of London have long enjoyed the privilege of electing the mayor. More than seven hundred years ago, King John was tyrannical and oppressive, and the citizens of London rose up in resistance, drawing up three chapters of law with him, and obtaining the right to self-government and to elect a mayor. This right has not been shaken to this day.

The Lord Mayor of London has supreme power within one square mile of the city. Even if the king enters the city, he must be granted the key and sword by the mayor on behalf of the citizens before being allowed to enter. Even royalty and nobles must give him some respect. No army in the country may march through the city in formation without the mayor's special permission. Only a small number of troops reorganized from the former London local army may pass through with bayonets fixed and flags flying, but the mayor must also be notified in advance.

The London police are an independent force, totaling more than one thousand in peacetime. The mayor has a bench of judges under him. He also serves as the chairman of the City Council and various municipal committees. In short, this square mile is all his domain.

Because the Lord Mayor of London has such great power, the citizens must make a great display when the new and old mayors change, to show solemnity. This time, some trivial rituals have been cut down because of the national crisis, which is already very unavoidable.

When the inauguration ceremony of the new mayor began, the outgoing mayor Clarkson sat in the middle, and the new mayor Wilkinson and his wife sat on his left and right. Next were Prime Minister Churchill and the Archbishop of Canterbury, sitting on their left and right. The city councilors, each wearing lavender robes, sat around the council seats. The mace-bearer first walked up to the table, bowed three times, and placed the mace on the floor, indicating that the term of the previous mayor had expired. Then, the new mayor Wilkinson took the oath of office, and exchanged seats with the previous mayor, completing the handover ceremony.

When the new mayor was seated, the master of ceremonies handed the crystal mace, the gold tablet, and the seal of office to the former mayor, who passed them on to the new mayor. At this time, the city officials one by one paid their respects to their new superior. The sword-bearer handed over the ceremonial sword, and then took it away again. The mace-bearer picked up the mace, the secretary presented the seal, and the auditor presented the employment document and the sealed register. Finally, the former mayor handed over the keys to the city seal vault, the hospital, the budget bureau, and the weights and measures. Each official had to bow three times when coming forward and when retiring, as if they were seeing the emperor. The prominence of the Lord Mayor of London is truly something to be proud of.

### British and American Efforts to Prevent Japan's Southern Advance Will Militarily Aid China; Far Eastern Crisis Hinges on Japan's Actions; Foreign Observers Analyze the General Situation

Whether the Pacific war can spare us and what impact it will have on China's future are matters of concern to all parties. According to a foreign observer yesterday, whether the Pacific storm can dissipate depends on whether Japan is keen on invading the South. Japan itself is mired in the quagmire of invading China and lacks the strength to extricate itself. However, as one of the Axis powers, it looks to its leader Hitler in all matters. Hitler, unable to conquer Britain, is driving Japan to coordinate in the Far East to divide Britain's power and facilitate its war efforts. Japan believes that unless Germany can defeat Britain or at least get a share of the spoils, it has no other good options. Therefore, although its posturing for a southern invasion seems imminent, Britain has obtained active assistance from the United States, and the United States, recognizing that the loss of the lips leads to the teeth being cold, and for the sake of consolidating its own interests in the Far East, is taking the same steps as Britain, strengthening its air and sea bases in the Far East to deal with those who harm its interests in the Pacific. It will not tolerate or concede, and will never allow those who advocate "East Asian Co-prosperity" to reap the benefits. Since these "East Asian Co-prosperity" advocates cannot bluff and intimidate the democratic countries, if Japan weighs its own strength and considers Germany, the war may not break out immediately. If Japan insists on going its own way, or estimates that Britain cannot attend to the East and the United States will not participate in the war, and is willing to be the culprit, then British and American aid to China will not only be limited to economic assistance as it is today, but will inevitably go further to military aid, increasing China's military advantages to achieve a pincer effect. What China lacks in its war effort is only military equipment, and then it can launch a full-scale counterattack, like sweeping away dead leaves, and stand on its own to win.

So-called Peace is Not Credible

The famous commentator Mr. Woodhead published an article in the English-language "Great American Weekly" yesterday, discussing the crisis in the Far East, stating that the reason why the peace talks of Japanese diplomats are not accepted by Britain and the United States is that Japan is a member of the "Unholy Tripartite Pact". Britain and the United States are deeply concerned that Japan's current peace gesture is the same as the behavior of Germany and Italy before engaging in aggression. Before Germany invaded the "Low Countries," it also issued its intention for peace, but within a few days, it was known for invading the "Low Countries". Before Italy invaded Greece, it also provided guarantees, but a few days later, it invaded Greece without prior warning. This is the specialty of the Axis countries. Therefore, Britain and the United States have sufficient reason to suspect Japan.

Nazi Personnel Active in Japan

Japan recently passed a "National Defense Secret Law," prohibiting participation in any activity aimed at benefiting foreign countries and prohibiting propaganda activities for foreign countries. However, Nazi secret agents are active in Japan, doing their best to win over Japan to participate in the Axis countries to fight against Britain. This is an open secret. Germany's purpose is to restrain Britain in the Pacific and divert the attention of the United States. When Hitler made this plan, he only considered the interests of his own country and did not care about Japan's interests. Germany may be generous with other people's property and give the land of the Far East to Japan, but it is unwilling to see an empire in the Far East that is hostile to it. This is something that does not require a wise man to know.

The United States Watches Japan's Actions

The situation in the Far East is still tense and there is no sign of relaxation in the short term. US Secretary of State Hull said that Americans judge Japan not by observing Japan's words, but by observing Japan's actions. But judging by Japan's actions, the crisis of war in the Far East has not disappeared. The United States has never agreed to Japan's "East Asian New Order" plan, and they are even more opposed to Japan expanding the "East Asian New Order" into the "Greater East Asia New Order". If such a plan is realized, the interests of the United States in East Asia will be swept away.

The Situation Has Become Intolerable

When the US House of Representatives was in session, it discussed the bill to defend US Pacific islands, which proves that the United States is dissatisfied with Japan's past actions and plans to take action here in the future. Last year, the United States intended to build defenses in Guam, but it was worried about Japan's opposition. Now, the United States has ignored Japan's reaction. Studying the debates in the US Congress, it can be seen that the United States can no longer tolerate Japan's actions and refuses to use appeasement to improve relations between the two countries. Under this situation, although Japan does not admit that it has aggressive intentions, the situation has reached this point and cannot be improved by Japan's words. Although every action of Britain and the United States is purely defensive in nature, it is enough to show their distrust of Japan.

### The Japanese Forcefully Conscript Laborers and Concentrate Them in the Wing On Cotton Mill; Many Are From the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Area; No One Is Seen on the Streets of Yangshupu at Night

The "North China Daily News" reported that yesterday (the 22nd), it was learned from reliable sources that the Japanese labor conscription teams continued to operate in the area north of Suzhou Creek controlled by the Japanese and used the Wing On Cotton Mill on Xihu Road, which was confiscated by the Japanese during the war in Shanghai, as a gathering place. It is said that the Japanese always set off to conscript laborers at night or early in the morning, taking advantage of the darkness. Sometimes the conscription lasted until 7:30 in the morning. It is also said that the conscription did not start on Saturday and Sunday of last week as previously reported, but that the conscription teams were already active on February 14.

Escaped Coolies Dare Not Speak Out

Information about this activity is still being collected, but most of the coolies who were conscripted and escaped are afraid of retaliation, so they are unwilling to describe their experiences in the hands of the Japanese army. Moreover, many of the men who were conscripted have families, young and old, who depend on them for a living. Nowadays, the cost of living is increasing day by day, and this person who feeds the whole family has been conscripted, or the family has no food left. It is not difficult to imagine the tragic situation.

The Japanese Army Even Subsidizes Households

Although the Japanese side has already admitted that it is forcibly conscripting Chinese people in its controlled areas, the officers have investigated the saying that Chinese male adults who have to support their whole family are also being forcibly conscripted. Now, they are going to the homes of these male adults and promising that if this is the case, the Japanese army will subsidize their households. It is said that there are more than 500 Chinese people detained in the Wing On Cotton Mill on Xihu Road, many of whom were conscripted in Pinghu, Jiading, and Minhang and transported by trucks. The rest were escorted from Haiyan, Xiashi, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou. There are quite a few people who have escaped from the Japanese detention, but they are afraid that if they are forcibly conscripted again, they will be severely punished, so they remain silent about their detention experiences.

Workers in Hamakita Dare Not Go Home at Night

However, it is a fact that there is no one on the streets of Yangshupu at night, and those who live in Hamakita and work in Hamaminami during the day stay in Hamaminami at night and are unwilling to return north. In March last year, the Japanese also forcibly conscripted laborers in Hamakita. The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy denied this, saying that the conscription was due to the arrest of criminals in Hamakita.

Passengers Decrease Sharply, Xiashi Stops Trading

Since the Japanese army along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway forcibly conscripted civilian laborers in this controlled area, this trend has not stopped. According to a visitor who just arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the Japanese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway began to forcibly conscript civilian laborers on the 16th, and more than 1,000 young Chinese people were forced to be conscripted. Xiashi was the most affected, with a total of more than 600 people. All the shops in the town were closed, and residents stayed indoors. It gradually recovered after five days. The residents of Chang'an, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Jiashan, and other places who were arrested were forced to board trains heading north, and there has been no news of them since. Now they all stay indoors and shops have closed down. The situation has suddenly become desolate, and the number of passengers taking trains has also decreased sharply in recent days.

### Americans' Feelings Towards Japan: Conclusions From Conversations in Hotels, Trains, and Barber Shops Coincide

A special correspondent for the English-language "Great American Weekly" in Chicago reported that people in Shanghai thought that the US authorities' notification to the Far Eastern American expatriates to withdraw meant that the United States was fully focused on the Far Eastern situation. In fact, the United States only recognizes that the Far Eastern Bureau is a secondary event. This is their mistake. It does not mean that the United States believes that the Far Eastern situation is already calm. The actual situation is completely the opposite. As far as the American people are concerned, they have been very concerned about the Far Eastern situation for the past two or three years and have analyzed it. What they expect is only the final solution.

No More Propaganda, Just Waiting for a Solution

American anti-Japanese propaganda is not as strong as it used to be because the American people's hatred of Japan does not need to be publicized again. Americans are also convinced that there will be a final solution to the Far Eastern problem. The Open Door Policy cannot be ignored. American interests cannot be violated. The American people, regardless of old or young, north or south, 95% of them firmly oppose Japan. All of Japan's troublemaking actions have strengthened the American people's anti-Japanese sentiment.

The Same Views in All Social Classes

When we first arrived in San Francisco, we chatted with the customs guards. Because we came from the Far East, the focus of the conversation was undoubtedly on the Far Eastern problem. The guard concluded, "We hate Japanese soldiers. Any American is willing to fight Japan for their country." We also discussed this issue with travelers in hotels, passengers on trains, employees in barber shops, and people in the press. Their emotions were the same as the customs guard.

The Government Is Determined and the People Support It

In a nutshell, the United States does not want to start a war, but they are more willing to fight the Japanese than the Germans, even though their interests in Europe are greater than in the Far East. The reason why the Far Eastern problem has changed from a primary to a secondary position is based on this. Today, newspapers no longer need to publicize to the American people the suffering of their compatriots in the Far East, nor do they need to awaken the American people to recognize that their government's policy is accurate. With the enthusiastic support of the people, the American government is almost determined.

### Rice Weevils Endanger the People's Food Supply; A Deadline Is Set for Secret Investigation and Detention; The Vietnamese Authorities Allow a Large Amount of New Rice to Be Shipped to Shanghai; The People Need Not Panic and Disturb the Order

The authorities, recognizing that Shanghai's food supply is extremely abundant and the source is continuously on its way, with a daily arrival of about 20,000 to 30,000 bags, and that the reason why rice prices are rising is that some unscrupulous rice merchants are being used to deliberately grab rice supplies in the market, attempting to confuse the people. Now, in order to relieve the people's distress and stabilize the entire food supply, they have ordered the city's agency responsible for stabilizing rice prices to conduct a secret investigation of these unscrupulous rice weevils as soon as possible, set a deadline for reporting the list, so that they can be severely punished according to the crime of endangering the people's food supply, or their business qualifications can be revoked. Now the city's agency responsible for stabilizing rice prices is said to be starting a secret investigation soon, and it is expected that these people will be severely punished.

Stopping the Price Surge

The authorities of the two concessions are deeply concerned about the city's entire food supply. In view of the past crisis and to prevent future shortages, it is said that they telegraphed the Rice Industry Association Committee yesterday to ask about the root cause of the recent rice market price surge and immediately ordered them to find ways to stop the rice price surge and various illegal transactions and strictly implement the price limit set on the 3rd of this month. If anyone dares to disobey, they can report to the authorities, who will provide strong assistance. The Rice Industry Committee has followed suit. It is also learned that the authorities have also ordered the stationed police detectives to strictly check the certificates of people entering and leaving the rice market and the actions of rice weevils buying and selling in the market. If any misconduct is found, they will be arrested and punished.

Evaluation Committee Consultation

The root cause of the recent rice price increase is the manipulation and monopoly of speculative rice weevils. If this continues, the future of the people's food supply will become increasingly worse. It is now learned that the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, in view of its responsibilities and in order to follow the instructions of the authorities, has decided to convene a special committee meeting in the coming days to discuss long-term, specific measures to stabilize the rice market and stop illegal transactions in the market. The price limit for 15 kinds of foreign rice will also be submitted for review. If it has exceeded the legal profit of 5%, the committee will continue to lower the price to lighten the burden on the people. However, for the sake of caution, the committee will invite representatives from the authorities of the two concessions to attend the meeting and give instructions so that they can be followed.

Saigon Shipping

The source of foreign rice from abroad has never been interrupted, and it has become more abundant recently. According to a rice industry tycoon yesterday, more than 650,000 bags of foreign rice have been shipped from overseas since this month, which can meet the city's food needs for one month. Furthermore, the quantity shipped to Shanghai recently has not diminished. A certain rice shop received a telegram from its counterpart in Saigon yesterday, "The ordered rice will be shipped today, and the Vietnamese authorities have approved the export of a large amount of new goods." It can be seen that the rumor that the Vietnamese authorities have banned the export of rice is obviously incorrect. Moreover, the Vietnamese authorities have also approved the export of new goods, so the rice weevils' rumors should not be believed by legitimate rice merchants. Merchants and people should also wait and see how the authorities will deal with the rice market in the shortest possible time. There is no need to panic and scramble to buy rice, which would be taken advantage of by the rice weevils, and do not cause disturbance to maintain public order.

### O.K. Yui Returns to Shanghai Tomorrow From the Philippines

O.K. Yui, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was injured by Lin Xiongji at the special meeting of Western taxpayers on the 23rd of last month. For the sake of recuperation, he applied for leave on the 7th of this month and took the President Doumer to Hong Kong. After resting in Hong Kong, he left Hong Kong on the 15th on the American mail ship President Coolidge to Manila. He did not stay in the Philippines for a long time and returned on the original ship President Coolidge the day before yesterday. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 1:30 tomorrow afternoon and land at the New Customs Wharf on the passenger ferry Mary Moller at 2:30. He will officially return to the bureau to cancel his leave and assume his duties the day after tomorrow. He will discuss and decide on the next board election and financial matters.

### Holding Fast to the Outer Bastion of the Pacific, China Must Fight a Long-Term War (I)

— T.V. Soong

Mr. T.V. Soong delivered a speech at the reception of the China-America Council in New York on the evening of January 23 this year, reviewing the Sino-Japanese problem and strongly criticizing Japan's reckless actions. All its ambitions will eventually become bubbles, and China, relying on its vast territory and infinite potential manpower, as well as the enthusiastic assistance of friendly countries, will certainly continue to fight for permanent peace to prevent Japan's southward advance. After the speech was published, it received much sympathy from Chinese and foreign people. The official translation of the full text has just been sent from Hong Kong to Shanghai yesterday, and it is specially recorded and published below.

Seven years ago, I went to London to attend the World Economic Conference and passed through New York. I spoke to you about the Japanese seizure of China's three northeastern provinces, saying that this problem, in the feelings of the general American, may be a distant and irrelevant event, but this is actually the beginning of international predatory behavior. If it is not stopped in time, it will progress step by step and inevitably become a terrible and effective precedent, evolving into other illegal actions that will drag the whole world into the vortex. A few days later, when I arrived in London, I gave a similar speech to the China Committee of the British House of Commons, chaired by the then Foreign Minister Sir John Simon, and quoted the words of Macaulay's historical thesis to confirm my words. Macaulay discussed that after a long period of peace in Europe, the Prussian King Frederick the Great's seizure of Silesia led to the "Seven Years' War," which eventually disturbed the world, so that "black people fought on the shores of Calamanda, and red people fought by the lakes of North America."

At this time when the flames of war cover the world, I am unfortunately correct in my words. It is meaningless to mention it today, but the second point I discussed at that time is fortunately correct; that is, the Japanese aggression will forge the hammer to unify China. China, in the midst of disaster, with the sacrifice of hot blood and the loss of finance, is invaluable, but the country will find its soul to step into the right track. Since I arrived in the United States this time, people have asked me, that is, Japan has the world's first-class army and navy, and a large number of new-style air forces. China, which loves peace, has neither a navy nor an air force, and the army is not fully equipped. How can it resist and defend itself? Tonight I will try to answer, but no matter what explanation we make, if we examine the infinite difficulties that our country has overcome, we will know that the real answer can be found in Cromwell's mysterious words. Cromwell said in a painful environment, "Relying on the righteousness of heaven and earth, we, though weak, will surely defeat the tyrants."

Fortunately, at this time of crisis of survival in China, we have found the person needed by the times, General Chiang Kai-shek; and the democratic countries, in the face of the alliance of Hitler, Mussolini, and Konoe, have outstanding leaders such as Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek, and the great President Roosevelt as their support, doing their best to help. This is the greatest good fortune. People usually think that Chiang is just a famous general. In fact, Chiang is also a great modern statesman who has a clear understanding of the meaning of this struggle and the application of politics and strength. Therefore, Chiang's value as a politician should be emphasized more than his value as a soldier, because Chiang regards war as a tool to achieve his goals, which is completely different from the viewpoint of the Japanese warlords.

Now, let me give an example to illustrate this: At the beginning of the war, Chinese warships defended Shanghai for three months under the fierce attack of the Japanese army's mechanized land forces and navy. At the end of the second month, the situation was obviously that it would be difficult to hold the line without great sacrifice. At that time, German military advisors and those who sympathized with China advised the Chinese army to withdraw in time, but Chiang, because the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty were meeting in Beijing to try to stop the Sino-Japanese conflict, ignored this opinion and resolutely ordered the troops to defend for another four weeks. At that time, I was in Shanghai and witnessed the suffering of our soldiers. Our front line had a weak point, and the Japanese army concentrated artillery and bombs to attack with all its strength. Our reinforcements, division after division, defended the front line. Every division of troops suffered half the casualties the next day, and another division had to replace it the next day, resisting artillery shells with flesh and blood. The cruelty of the massacre was unimaginable. Here you can see an example, that is, even if the front line should be withdrawn from a military standpoint, it must continue to resist because of a greater purpose. Some say that the Beijing meeting completely failed, and the Chinese sacrifice in Shanghai in the last month was useless, but the real statesman is willing to suffer setbacks in local battles to save the victory of the entire war.

When Japan started the war in 1937, it was high-spirited. Konoe declared to foreign reporters and the Japanese people that within three months, it would defeat China and make it surrender. He thought that the victory of this war would be like today's so-called blitzkrieg, making a fierce attack at the highest speed, causing China to collapse overnight. Today, the Japanese estimate of the war situation is obviously wrong. We know that the prolongation of the war is beneficial to us. Under the state of war, the Japanese army, in addition to its millions of troops and thousands of aircraft, must maintain the world's number one navy. The prolongation of time will eventually exhaust it. To make the Chinese nation develop its great and solid strength, there must be sufficient time; to make the democratic countries understand that China is fighting for itself and other democratic countries, it also takes a considerable amount of time. When the democratic countries have this awareness, they will give China unlimited assistance.

China, as the first victim of aggression, has long recognized that if acts of aggression are tolerated and rewarded, they will lead to countless new acts of aggression, eventually endangering the democratic life of the whole world. After the outbreak of the European war, other countries gradually realized that the wars in Europe and Asia are different aspects of the struggle between democratic and totalitarian countries. Since Japan officially joined the German-Italian alliance on September 27, 1940, everyone has known that China's victory is the victory of the democratic countries, and China's failure is the failure of the democratic countries. China has achieved the purpose of prolonging the war. Not only has the war to quickly conquer China in three months failed to materialize, but now the war has been prolonged for three and a half years, and Japan is deeply mired in a bitter struggle and unable to extricate itself.

### The Zhang Erniang Case of Murdering Her Husband; The Adulterer Pang Kaibao Has Been Sentenced to Death; The Detective Lawyer Asks That the Adulterous Woman Be Heavily Punished

Zhang Erniang (24 years old), a Jiangbei woman residing in a humble house in Rongshuilong, Hangzhou Road, Yangshupu, colluded with her lover and fellow villager from Funing, Pang Kaibao, on the midnight of February 21 of the year before last, using a sharp axe to strike her husband, Bao Youqing, on the head several times while he was sleeping soundly, fracturing his skull. After he died, they carried the body to a nearby pool and tied a rope around his waist with a lead bucket full of stones to sink it into the pool.

Pang Kaibao Sentenced to Death; After the incident, Pang was arrested by the Western and Chinese detectives of the Yangshupu Station and sent to the First Special District Court. Pang Kaibao was sentenced to death and awaited execution in the Huade Road Prison. Zhang Erniang took the opportunity to escape back to her hometown of Caijiaqiao and later married a Mr. Gao as his wife. She could not be arrested, and the court issued a warrant for her arrest. In January of this year, Zhang Erniang suddenly came to Shanghai with Mr. Gao and hid in a house at 1351 Roberts Road. She was discovered by Chinese Detective Chief Tao Genrong and Detective Xie Zhiguang of the Gordon Road Station. At 7 a.m. on the 15th of this month,

The Adulterous Woman Was Arrested; They rushed to the address to arrest Zhang Erniang and sent her to the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened a court to hear the case. Detective Lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution based on Article 271, Section 1 of the Criminal Law for the crime of murdering her husband and asked that the defendant Zhang Erniang be given the highest degree of punishment to warn others from following her example. When questioned, the defendant claimed that she and her lover Pang Kaibao went to a theater that night and when they returned home, her husband Bao Youqing was not there. He had been arrested by the Japanese Command for theft.

The Confession Was Cunning; She completely denied that she murdered him and dumped the body in a nearby pool. When Pang Kaibao, who had been sentenced to death, was questioned, he refused to repeat his previous confession in court that Zhang Erniang had borrowed a sharp axe from an old woman named Li Jiang next door, falsely claiming that she was chopping wood, and then handed it to him to kill her husband while he was sleeping soundly. Zhang Erniang held the head of the body, and he held the feet and threw the body into the pool. He insisted, "I have been sentenced to death and am a fugitive. The prison wardens do not feed me enough every day, nor do they feed my fellow prisoners. I suffer from hunger. I ask the court to notify the prison wardens to feed me enough in the future, and then I will confess all the circumstances of killing Bao Youqing." Judge Jiang, based on his previous confession in court, which was indeed undeniable, and the process being as clear as a picture, announced that the case would begin to be debated, and Zhang Erniang was sent back to custody. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 28th.

### Issue 359 Wartime Finance in Germany By Zhou Shuhua

It seems that Germany under Hitler's rule does not feel much difficulty regarding wartime finance. We have not heard of them raising taxes, forcing savings, or issuing large amounts of wartime public debt. Recently, they even abolished an important tax. The tax revenue of Germany up to March 31, 1940, has achieved unprecedented results in this fiscal year; although millions of people cannot produce or pay taxes due to joining the military service, the tax revenue in the recent four months is sufficient to prove that there must be good results in this fiscal year.

The savings of the people in the banks have a higher record every month. The interest rate of German public debt has been reduced from 4.5% to 4%, and at the same time, the term of newly issued public debt has been increased from ten years to twenty years. In fact, German public debt is quickly absorbed by the public and does not require major promotion. Because Germany has too much money, these facts are undeniable and are often greatly publicized by the Nazis.

Since 1933, they have been preparing for total war, and they have also paid attention to the financial aspect. Germany's advantage over Britain lies in the fact that Germany's debts from World War I were almost completely resolved due to the hyperinflation of 1923, while Britain still has to pay the principal and interest on its public debt. Therefore, Britain's tax revenue that can be used for war is somewhat inferior to that of Germany. However, this initial advantage is gradually disappearing because Germany has issued a large amount of new public debt to reorganize its military. In 1914, Germany's national debt was over 50 billion marks (approximately 2.5 billion pounds). In 1918, it had increased to 157 billion marks (approximately 7.85 billion pounds). At that time, this was a staggering number.

Germany's failure in World War I was not due to the collapse of its finances. When the armistice was signed, the German National Bank still had more than 20 billion gold marks, and Germany's overseas investments were estimated to be at least 20 billion marks. The reason Germany had to sue for peace was due to military exhaustion, mostly due to long-term strict blockades.

However, the heavy burden of territorial cession and reparations after the military failure, with debts extended for at least fifty or sixty years, made Germany's post-war desire for cancellation an urgent matter. Germany could only overcome this difficulty under one condition—that is, having an unlimited market that could accommodate and absorb its countless industrial exports. Undoubtedly, one of the basic reasons for this war lies in the fact that Germany has been trying its best since 1918 to open up a vast foreign market to solve its financial difficulties, while other countries are also forced to compete on the same path due to their own war debts.

Before Hitler came to power, he knew that although reparations had stopped, to solve Germany's economic problems, he believed that the most important thing was to solve the unemployment problem, which required an unlimited market to accommodate German industries. With a market, the unemployment problem would no longer exist. However, exports cannot suddenly increase greatly. The emergency solution was for the government to "unrestrictedly" place orders itself. And rearmament was the most reasonable method. As for the German army, navy, and air force, they almost all had to be reorganized, and the needs seemed to be unlimited. Therefore, 60% to 70% of the orders accepted by the German industry came from this rearmament.

Almost seven million people have regained their jobs. These people used to live on government relief. Germany could avoid paying this huge amount, so the budget was balanced and government tax revenue also increased. The reason is that these workers can now pay taxes. The center of gravity of this process is of course that wages are paid by the government. Only a small portion of the money earned flows back, increasing tax revenue. The money earned is not a real economic profit.

At first, Hitler did not have to worry too much about imported raw materials because factories throughout Germany had a lot of inventory, and these raw materials were not of much use because of the global economic recession. According to German annual reports, when Hitler came to power, Germany had industrial raw materials and semi-finished products worth no less than 20 billion marks (or 1 billion pounds). Hitler also did not lack factory equipment. Before the Nazi group came to power, German industry had been completely on track. And there were many skilled workers. Therefore, a large number of products were waiting to be developed.

All that was needed to revitalize industry was (1) orders and (2) funds. These two items could be supplied by the government without restrictions. Orders came entirely from rearmament.

Hitler knew that such a vast project required a large amount of money. The source of this money is the secret of the German financial "miracle" and also explains the superficial success of German wartime finance. They do not use a single remedy. What is used are hundreds of clever plans, just multiple applications of a few basic principles.

Hitler believed that expenses increased without limit with production. But his approach regarded the manufacture of munitions as a purely economic product. Unless these munitions can be sold for export, then of course it is another matter. Storing some tanks and airplanes reduces some raw materials and freezes some working capital. If this work is to continue, unless funds can be borrowed continuously.

When Dr. Schacht was in office, he worked very hard to organize short-term borrowing. The German government used monopolistic financial markets and prohibited private issuance to force all savings banks, insurance companies, trust corporations, mortgage, and commercial banks to promote short-term treasury bills and subscribe to long-term government bonds. These treasury bills can be discounted, so they are almost the same as cash. Public bonds were quickly sold because government bonds are the best—at least in theory—and have good interest. Therefore, all the savings of the laboring classes, the profits from industry, banking, and investment, and the interest on bonds and mortgages are constantly and automatically helping the German government to reorganize its military. The money earned will flow back to do this work.

Hitler repeatedly advocated the necessity of "increasing and producing" because this could increase some tax revenue. Workers are forced to work longer hours. The government constantly ordered more sophisticated machines to increase output. Technical research is very important. Agriculture has been electrified.

Because of the heavy taxes of the party and the donations of the "Workers' Front" and "Winter Relief," their living standards have actually been greatly reduced. If they do not openly complain, it is because they at least still have work to do under Hitler's rule. Dividends have long been fixed at six percent. Profits exceeding this interest rate must be invested in government bonds. So shareholders do not enjoy the benefits of increased production. And to prevent unnecessary waste of people, rationing was invisibly implemented two years before the war.

If what Hitler said at the beginning of the war is true—he said that rearmament cost a total of 90 billion marks—then it can be shown that the German government had a total debt of 95 billion marks as of the end of November 1939, and between 115 billion and 120 billion in August 1940. Of course, the debts of other cities, towns, and villages must also be added.

According to records, German debt—including only a small portion of short-term borrowing—was 55.2 billion marks at the end of June 1940. When Hitler came to power, there was only 11.7 billion marks of debt.

From the second quarter of 1940, German national debt increased by an average of about 2.7 billion marks per month. Previously, it increased by 2.05 billion per month. In the first ten months of the war, the total amount of long- and short-term bonds issued was 21 billion marks. Minister Reinhardt recently declared that tax revenue can only cover half of Germany's war expenses. Therefore, Germany's national debt will soon exceed the total amount at the end of the last World War. Recently, Germany also admitted that it had to reduce the interest rate from 4.5% to 4% because it needed to raise more debt.

In an omnipotent country, production only barely exists, interest rates can be lowered again, heavy taxes can be levied again, debts can be partially or completely cancelled, and living standards can be further reduced by implementing a stricter rationing system; this method can be continued until the people can no longer tolerate it. Therefore, Hitler does not seem to be likely to fail due to the problem of fiscal balance. But Nazi finance is built on the premise that Germany must win because they can demand huge reparations by winning and transfer their own "bankruptcy" to Britain.

Hitler must assume that Germany will win and that the war can be ended in the short term, so he does not need to worry too much about the increase in national debt as in the past. He thinks that Britain will eventually surrender unconditionally. The tasks he should do at present are: (1) try his best to cope with all domestic expenses without implementing inflation; (2) all goods that have to be imported should be paid for with cash, securities, or exports. What clever methods has Germany been using to implement this all the time? Can Germany continue like this until the end of the war? If Britain implements the same methods, will there be the same effect?

If it is said that Germany has not increased taxes, except for increasing income tax by 50% and indirect taxes such as tobacco and alcohol by 20% when the war was declared, the reason is that Nazi Germany placed the financial system on wartime standards long before the war and greatly increased taxes until Hitler also believed that it could not be increased anymore.

If Germany can still increase taxes after the war, it is because consumption has been greatly reduced due to stricter restrictions.

If savings banks can continue to increase deposits, the reason is that more working hours can bring more income, but because there are restrictions on consumption, consumption has not increased. In Germany, hoarding wealth is a crime, and people's savings must be deposited in banks. After the bank's savings accumulate, they are transferred to the government in exchange for short-term treasury bills or long-term public debt. And if, although many workers have joined the front line, savings conversely do not decline during the war, it is because most of the work has been taken over by women, and fertilizers have been used on a large scale in farmland, and electrification has been implemented.

The reason why it is not necessary to greatly promote the raising of public debt for the war is that after the outbreak of the war, the issuance of public debt continued to be automatically sold by savings banks, mortgage banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, and other institutions because these institutions have a lot of idle funds seeking investment channels. According to the latest announcement, 275 million marks of 4% government bonds were issued in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and another 175 million marks were issued in the form of so-called "clearance bonds" (Li-Loans). This kind of public bond is probably to be repaid in the short term. A total of 4.5 billion public bonds were issued in March.

Germany's war resources are entirely due to (1) maintaining and increasing production; (2) reducing consumption through restraint; (3) all unused income automatically flowing back to the government. But Minister Lecht also admits that this amount is not enough to pay all war expenses, and says that donations and taxes can only bear half of the expenses. This means that Germany's debt must increase by at least 25 billion marks per year.

If the war intensifies, this number will inevitably increase further. Lecht also mentioned in the same speech that Germany borrowed 4.5 billion marks in March, which shows that Germany's short-term bonds must increase by 70 billion to 100 billion marks per year. From another report, we learned that Germany's monthly expenditure in World War I was 2 billion marks, and now the monthly war expenditure is about 4 billion marks. This increase is entirely due to the mechanization of the war.

At the end of 1932, the amount of banknotes issued was 3.5 billion, and by the end of August 1940, it reached a record high, with the amount issued increasing to 13 billion. From this point, we always feel that he is in the stage of expansion. In fact, the increase in currency, including dime coins, is even greater. At the end of 1932, the total circulation was 5.6 billion; at the end of July 1939, it was 12 billion marks, and now the amount issued is unknown because the number of dime coins is unknown. But Germany has not felt the serious impact of inflation. If the increase in Germany's territory and the increase in production are also taken into account, then the increase in the amount of banknotes issued may not be considered excessive. Because the "price stop" (“Price stop”) is strictly maintained under police force, so the impact of inflation is very difficult to detect anyway.

Maintaining finance by expanding credit cannot be applied indefinitely. At the end of 1937, credit expansion had reached its peak. At that time, production had reached its highest level; factories were processing and manufacturing, and there were no unemployed workers. Now, the president of the German National Bank, Dr. Schacht, declares that credit expansion will stop. Hitler also agreed. But he knew that unless the country could supply industry with "Infinite markets"—that is to say, unless it continued to work hard to reorganize its military—the unemployment problem would arise.

In terms of finance, Nazi Germany does not seem to encounter difficulties at present. Her biggest problem is whether she can maintain the supply of raw materials. Rationing was implemented two years before the war. Food and raw materials have long been stored. They have saved more than seven years of materials to deal with this great war.

To reduce imports, they implemented a four-year plan, resulting in the manufacture of various synthetic products—woven fibers, liquid fuels, artificial rubber—and the large-scale application of substitutes, such as replacing copper with aluminum. They tried their best to grow agricultural crops until—boasting of a good harvest!—that under the current wartime standard of rationing, Germany relied on its own country for 83% of its food. After the war was launched, food was limited to the minimum. A large number of items were stored in cold storage two years before the war was launched. Therefore, if the harvest is not good, it will not reduce the supply of food again, but it will inevitably have to rely on pre-stored food.

Germany cannot export those superior special products that people need, for example. Because Germany also needs it. She imports goods from neighboring countries in a very orderly manner by credit until the credit limit is reached. If possible, she pays for all imports with toys, musical instruments, glassware, porcelain, earthenware, glasses, dyes, medicines, and printing—all of which are produced domestically this year. Germany produces a lot of coal, so if there is a surplus, she will export it. The countries of the Balkan Peninsula also do not hesitate to advocate that Germany should reorganize their old debts.

But now, as in 1933, 1918, and 1914, Germany's current problem is how to find new markets under its own jurisdiction that are sufficient to consume its industrial exports to pay for all import bills and settle debts to other countries.

(Reprinted from "The London Times") Such is What I Saw and Heard

Four American commercial banks have suspended US dollar checking accounts. Speculators. Obviously, what is the reason for the question? Why ask the question? The effect of this move is self-evident.

In the article "The Expansion of the European War and the Future of US Exchange Rates" in this journal's issue 319 on May 13 last year, it was suggested that the United States take over the funds of China, Japan, and other countries in the United States to curb speculation. At first, it seemed like a dream, but now it is like an ideal that is being realized.

In the article "The Future of the Sino-Japanese Currency War" in this journal's issue 352 on December 30 last year, the possibility of Sino-US currency cooperation was predicted; at first, I felt that it was too optimistic, but now it has become inevitable.

The fact that Germany and the Soviet Union expressed goodwill to each other in the early autumn was indeed shocking. However, the way in which they expressed goodwill still made Hitler worry about the East. The initial shock was really not worth it. It is now rumored that the principles of Soviet-Japanese economic cooperation have been signed in Moscow, which is another shocking news. However, what is surprising is why this news is specially released from Saigon? A Brief Discussion on Controlled Economy By Yan Maode

The organization of a controlled economy, that is, the agency that implements a controlled economy, or the general staff of the economy, the main body of this kind of headquarters organization, should be organized by the original government. If this kind of headquarters organization is not necessary at all, then the newly established organization should be reorganized by new forces and grant the original government authority over the activities of the industry. It can be seen that the scope, objectives, and extent of this newly established general staff should be determined by the method of constituting the organization and the powers conferred. And this kind of headquarters is dominated by officials, party members, etc., and it can be said that it is owned by capitalists. If it is dominated by the middle class, it will also have to change its face. Knowing the headquarters organization of this kind of headquarters means knowing the future development of this kind of organization, but the organizations of various countries are different. Each country has its own background and should be determined by politics. The organization of the general staff of the Soviet Union has the International Committee, Germany has the Economic Committee, Italy has the National Combination Agreement Council, and the United Kingdom has the Advisory Committee. These and other things show the different organizations of various countries.

After the establishment of the general staff, in its work, there are several clear goals: (1) How to reconcile the economic and political organization of liberalism and the government of a democratic system. From an economic point of view, liberalism is based on personal enterprise creation, so the government should absolutely freely agree to the creation of personal enterprise, but the democratic system is absolutely protecting the creation of personal enterprise, and it has been like this since the eighteenth century. From the trend of modern enterprise development, concentrated enterprises are greater than personal enterprises. Under a democratic system, it is not necessary to oppose this system. Of course, it is necessary to pay close attention to how to guide personal enterprises to the road of concentrated enterprises. This will inevitably require a new organization to take on the responsibility, which requires an economic general staff. (2) How to apply specialized science to enterprises to increase their organizational power, and the power of this organization was even more obvious after the last world war. (3) How to reconcile the interests of the state with the interests that conflict with the state. In other words, how to reconcile the conflicting interests between countries. (4) How to establish a general staff so that the old productive forces in the economy can be applied to the happiness of the society. Based on the organizations currently adopted by various countries, the power granted to this organization, and the motives and methods of the organization, the economic achievements controlled by various countries are different, so their nature and direction are also different. Commercial News Economic Miscellany Clock Time By Feng Liutang

The influx of chiming clocks into China began in the Ming Dynasty. Feng Shike of the Ming Dynasty once said in Pengchuang Reading Records:

"I saw the Western Taoist Li Mabao have a chiming clock, which is only like a small incense box, with twelve hours a day, chiming twelve times in total, which is also a strange object."

It can be seen that at that time, Feng was a rare object. On September 15th of the fifth year of Chongzhen, there was a lunar eclipse. Because the timing calculated by the Qin Tianjian, the Huihui Department, and the Western method (that is, the method transmitted by Li Mabao, etc.) was different, Xu Guangqi presented a memorial stating the reasons for the difference, mentioning the timing method:

"The method of determining the time in the morning and evening, the pot leak is the ancient method, and the wheel clock is the new method, but it is not as good as seeking the end from the sun and stars. Use the sun during the day, and use a star at night. All use instruments to measure the longitude and latitude and calculate it. This is the timing method."

The so-called "wheel clock is the new method" refers to the chiming clock. Take the time from the sun and stars to measure the hour, which is the sidereal time.

Why is it called a chiming clock? Because it can strike the bell and sound the time when it arrives, without human intervention, so it is called chiming, and it is also called a time clock.

But the automatic striking of the bell to tell the time also existed in ancient China, starting with the bronze armillary sphere made by Tang monk Yi Xing and Liang Lingzan, which was turned by leaking water, but it was not perfect. And in the fourth year of Taiping Xingguo in the Song Dynasty, Zhang Sixun from Bazhong created it and presented it. Taizong summoned craftsmen to make it in the forbidden palace, which was completed in more than a year, and placed it under the drum tower east of the Wenming Palace. Its system started with a building more than ten feet high, and the machine was hidden inside, regulating the sky and measuring the earth, and setting up a ground wheel and ground feet below, and also making a horizontal wheel, side wheel, and inclined wheel, setting the body pass, middle pass, and small pass, seven sky pillars, a straight god shaking the bell on the left, knocking on the bell on the right, and striking the drum in the middle to determine the number of moments. Every day and night, it cycles and repeats. It also uses wood to make twelve gods, each in charge of one hour. When the time comes, they will hold the hour plate by themselves, circulate and come out, and determine the length of day and night according to the number of moments... It uses the Kaiyuan legacy method, operating with water, and when it freezes and becomes slow in mid-winter, it becomes sparse and rough, and there is no accuracy in cold and heat, so mercury is used instead, so there is no error. In the old system, the movement of the sun and moon day and night were all operated by people, and the new system is made by nature. It is especially exquisite. It is a pity that after Zhang Sixun died, it was abandoned due to disrepair, and the method was not passed down. Comparatively speaking, all kinds of Chinese productions are mostly like this, rising and falling with people, so there is no opportunity to improve production. The armillary sphere made by Zhang Sixun, although made of wood, also uses wheels and axles, and the sun, moon, and five planets are attached to it, and the length of day and night, the advancement and retreat of cold and heat, are all without error, which is like the so-called astronomical clock today in principle and use.

However, at that time, clocks and watches were still rare objects, and it was still like this in the early Qing Dynasty. However, during the Kangxi period, the Holy Ancestor of Qing presented chiming clocks as a gift to the Empress Dowager. In the tribute from the Netherlands in the twenty-fifth year of Kangxi, there was also a large chiming clock, so there were only many kinds of chiming clocks in the Qing Palace, displayed in a hall. Precisely because they were foreign imports, in the early Qing Dynasty, they were still limited to noble families. If you don't believe it, just look at the chiming clock in the room of Phoenix Sister seen by Granny Liu in Dream of the Red Chamber, which made a loud noise and was mistaken for a monster. The sixth chapter of the book says:

"Granny Liu only heard a clang sound, which seemed like she was beating a basket cabinet to sieve noodles, and she couldn't help but look around. Suddenly, she saw a box hanging on the pillar in the hall, and there was a weight-like object hanging underneath, but it kept shaking randomly. Granny Liu thought to herself, what is this thing, what is it for? Just as she was stunned, she suddenly heard a dang sound, like a golden bell and copper chime, which startled her, and then there were eight or nine in a row."

It can be seen that Granny Liu, who claimed to be "living under the Son of Heaven's limbs," still did not recognize this thing, and others can be imagined. Not only Granny Liu, but even Qing Long Xianglin's Zhujiang Mission Record still found the large chiming clock in Macau to be peculiar, and it said:

"There is a timing platform, and a giant clock covers it. A flying fairy stands on the corner of the platform, acting as a striking figure, also turned by a machine. It rings on time, starting with one sound at midnight, to twelve sounds at noon, and then starting with one sound at noon to twelve sounds at midnight, cycling day and night without any error. On the front is a round plate, with twelve signs of the zodiac during the day. When the clock moves at a certain time, the toad will move its finger to indicate the position."

Speaking of clocks, I deeply feel that there is the most information in Dream of the Red Chamber, which can show the types, forms, and values of clocks, such as in the fourteenth chapter:

"Phoenix Sister assigned tasks, and when the people in Ning Mansion were doing things, she said: 'People who follow me on weekdays all have clocks and watches with them. No matter how big or small things are, they all have a fixed time. Anyway, there are also time clocks in your upper room. I will call the roll at the second quarter of Maozheng, and eat breakfast at Yizheng. Anyone who receives a card to report back should only be at the second quarter of Wuchu.'"

It can be seen that there are time clocks in the upper room of Ning Mansion, and Phoenix Sister not only has clocks and watches herself, but also her personal servants all have clocks and watches, which is even more wealthy than Ning Mansion. There is a table clock in Baoyu's room, such as in the fifty-first chapter when Baoyu asked Qingwen if her head was hot?

"Qingwen coughed twice and said, it doesn't matter, why have I become so delicate? As she spoke, she only heard the chiming clock in the outer room ring twice with a dang dang." (To be continued) Cinchona Tree (Continued) By Gao Jiannong

After this, the name of the cinchona tree gradually attracted people's attention and was known to people. In 1727 AD, La Condomine, a famous astronomer who measured the length of the meridian in the equatorial region, saw the cinchona tree with his own eyes in Peru; later, at the end of the 18th century, many famous scholars and merchants also saw this tree during their travels or explorations in South America and wrote reports. However, it was not until 1820 that pharmacologists Pelletier and Caventou chemically extracted the chemical components of quinine, and Maillot, a military doctor in Algeria, disregarded all opposition and used it to treat the fever in that area. Since then, botanists and chemists have felt passionately interested in the study of cinchona trees.

As a result of all the exploration teams, it is known that this tree includes more than 60 species, only growing in a narrow arcuate zone on the eastern side of the Andes Mountains, from Venezuela in the north to Bolivia in the south, at an altitude of about 1,500 meters to 2,500 meters, with a climate of nine months of abundant rainy season and three months of considerable dry season. After the anti-malarial efficacy of cinchona bark became widely known, many medicine-gathering aborigines or mixed races flocked to these high mountain areas: they collected medicine by cutting down the surrounding cinchona trees halfway up, one person high from the ground! Their destruction and damage caused the cinchona trees to decrease day by day and have a tendency to become extinct. The Jesuit monks and all the explorers in the area saw the danger and seriousness of this matter, so there were plans for transplantation and cultivation. In 1850 AD, a French explorer named Weddel brought cinchona seeds from Bolivia to the famous "Paris Botanical Garden": the first few cinchona trees in India and Java were divided from the Paris Botanical Garden.

The Dutch in the South Seas Islands, after 20 years of struggle, in 1870, transported the first bag of cinchona bark to their country. But now this production is almost entirely in the hands of the Dutch, who have ten million cinchona trees of the best quality on the island of Java alone, producing 1,500 tons of "sulfurized quinine" annually. However, even so, we Shanghai people, who are close to the South Seas, still have to eat small white pills that cost two or three cents each! Shouldn't this be as essential to the daily use of the masses as bread and plain water! Are there any producers in the world who sincerely seek happiness for the masses?......

Reference books: Coutiere's Biological World, Caustier's Botany, (End) Chebai Returned to Small Four Corners

Yesterday's sugar market was flat due to the Sunday trend. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was 80 yuan and 6 to 5 cents at the end of this month, and 80 yuan and 8 cents on the 10th of next month. Taikoo Chebai B mark was 80 yuan and 8 cents in the West, and 80 yuan and 4 cents in the East. The price of sticky four corners and HX mark in the West was 79 yuan, also down 4 cents.

The Firewood and Soap Price Increase is Intensified

The price of firewood is rising sharply due to panic over raw materials. The inventory of the industry is gradually decreasing, and the price is rising continuously. Yesterday, the price of Beautiful Brand was 575 yuan per box, Phoenix Brand was 570 yuan per box, second-class miscellaneous brands were 510 yuan per box, and third-class miscellaneous brands were 490 yuan per box. The price increase of soap is also quite strong because the supply from the factory to the industry is not enough for market sales, resulting in high and popular prices for weeks. Currently, the market price of Gubenzao is 31 yuan and 5 cents per box, Baixiangmao Soap is 27 yuan and 5 cents, Huangxiangmao Soap is 23 yuan and 5 cents, and Scissors Soap is 24 yuan and 5 cents.

Food, Clothing, Housing, Transportation, Food Therapy Miscellany By Wang Jue Lie

Food is essential for our human body. In addition to supplementing the substances consumed in the human body, this can help growth and development, and has a close relationship like machines and machine oil.

Food not only has the functions mentioned above, but also has several diseases that can indeed rely on the power of food to achieve the result of treatment.

Beriberi is a very popular disease in society. Everyone knows that this disease is caused by a lack of vitamin B. Then, as long as the missing vitamin B is supplemented, the disease will naturally be cured. Foods such as beans and jujubes contain extremely rich vitamin B. Patients with beriberi can eat more of these things during three meals a day, and the disease can disappear invisibly. Especially in Shanghai, most of the rice eaten is Saigon rice, which is really very lacking in vitamin B. It is also the best way for us healthy people to eat more vitamin B-rich beans and red dates to prevent beriberi.

For diseases such as bleeding gums or bleeding oral mucosa, fruits such as oranges, apples, citrus lemons, etc., have a special therapeutic effect because they contain vitamin C. The so-called clearing heat is not very reasonable. Bleeding gums and oral mucosa is a sign of vitamin C deficiency. Fruits contain a lot of vitamin C, so they have this effect. It is best to eat fruits raw, not cooked, as vitamin C will be completely dispersed by high heat.

Although pig liver and lamb liver are common foods, they are very good for night blindness. Night blindness is when the vision is blurred at night when it is dark. Pig liver or lamb liver is often cooked in a rice pot to maintain the original effective ingredients. Many night blindness patients often eat this kind of thing, and the blurred vision will slowly decrease, and it can be completely cured over time. The cause of night blindness is nutritional imbalance and lack of vitamin A during other diseases. Pig liver and lamb liver contain a lot of vitamin A, and the therapeutic effect will of course be good.

Miscarriage in pregnant women is the most annoying thing. If you encounter such a disease, you can eat more beef, liver, egg yolks, lettuce and other foods to prevent it. Although there are many causes of miscarriage in pregnant women, vitamin E deficiency is the most important. The above-mentioned foods are rich in vitamin E, so they also have considerable effects. Why Don't Chinese Women Have Hats? By Si Hua

Chinese women are not absolutely without hats. The phoenix coronet in ancient times, the headscarf in the late Qing Dynasty, and the current occasional discovery of woolen bowl-shaped hats on the heads of rural women; in addition to the phoenix coronet still being used by brides in old-fashioned weddings, it can only be seen in operas. Headscarves and bowl-shaped hats may still be cherished by elderly women, but young women, especially modern women, simply disdain them, so generally speaking, Chinese women lack hats.

But do Chinese women need hats? This is very easy to answer. Just look at the popularity of hairnets and hair ties to prove that women need a practical and decorative item on their heads. Because there are no women's hats, they imitate what they see in imported films and use hairnets and ribbons as substitutes. However, this kind of decoration only avoids messy hair and has no effect of protecting the nerves in the head. In fact, it is far from being a hat. Ribbons are even limited to girls and young women. It is inappropriate for middle-aged women to tie their hair with them, even if the color of the ribbon is not obvious. Therefore, women need hats of appropriate styles and materials.

We know that foreign women have many hats. Hats for wearing formal clothes are elegant and luxurious; hats for wearing casual clothes are light and generous; and hats for sports have even more styles, which can be matched with the clothes worn to achieve a beauty that complements each other. I remember didn't the seven dwarfs in the Snow White film all have very strange hats? This style of hat was first adopted by Hollywood actresses, and then from California to New York, and now it has become the most common casual hat for American women.

However, if women wearing short coats and short skirts wear this kind of women's hat, it is very elegant, but we who wear cheongsams can only sigh at the hat.

Fashion experts will never not think of women's hats, but before there are suitable and improved women's clothes, women's hats will not be given much attention. Women's hats absolutely have their development potential in China. Fashion experts can use their brains to invent them. After the invention, apply for a patent. In the future, if a hat becomes popular, you will immediately earn a lot of money, and the creators will have illustrious names in the history of women's clothing reform! As for how to make it popular after creation, someone suggested a clever advertising strategy, saying that you only need to hire hundreds of young women, wearing hats, to wander on Jing'an Temple Road and Xiafei Road, and you will be able to attract the attention of thousands of people. Women will imitate them when they see them, and gradually promote them. It is not difficult to make women's hats popular in Shanghai. Shanghai's clothing is the model for the whole country. Women's hats go to the inland areas, and they have both decorative and practical functions, so they will naturally have a broad future.

### Zheng Xiang Zhuang Twice Sued for One Zhuang Draft

Issued Promissory Note at Customer's Request, Dispute Arises from Apprentice's Loss

Zheng Xiang Tong Ji Zhuang at No. 15 Shunli, Beijing Road, upon the request of Hong Shiyuan, the owner of Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store, a frequent customer, issued an immediate promissory note (i.e., a Zhuang draft) No. 185 on January 8th of this year, and delivered it to Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store. The draft then passed into the possession of Dingtai Yong Yin Bank at No. 17 Changxin Lane, Tianjin Road. Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store then applied to the Zhuang to report the loss, claiming that the draft was lost en route. Hong Shuliang, the legal representative of Dingtai Yong Yin Bank, unable to cash the draft, recently engaged lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, suing Zheng Xiang Money Exchange.

Ignoring Payment, The reason stated is that on January 8th of this year, the plaintiff received from customer Ying Yankang, also known as Kang Ji, a promissory note for 18,360 yuan issued by the defendant Zheng Xiang Money Exchange. The plaintiff, trusting Zheng Xiang Money Exchange and adhering to the principle of recognizing the draft and not the person, allowed Kang Ji to use it to offset 10,006 yuan in national currency. Subsequently, when the draft was sent to the Bank of Asia for encashment, the defendant unexpectedly stopped payment. On the 9th of last month, the plaintiff negotiated with the defendant, who stated that Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store had requested the stop payment. This case had been preliminarily heard once by Judge Ni, who ordered a postponement for further hearing. Meanwhile, Hong Shiyuan, the owner of Yonghe Cotton Cloth Store, separately engaged lawyers Fei Xizhen and Wang Hengyi to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, suing Dingtai Yong Yin Bank, demanding the return of the draft, and also listing Zheng Xiang Money Exchange as a defendant, requesting a judgment for the payment of 18,360 yuan. The reason stated is that on January 7th of this year, through the mediation of Ying Yankang, eight boxes of cloth were purchased from Xinyuan Cotton Cloth Store, valued at 18,360 yuan. At about 11 a.m. on the 8th, a promissory note obtained from Zheng Xiang Money Exchange was given to apprentice Hu Bingkui to accompany Ying Yankang to Xinyuan Cotton Cloth Store in the Securities Building on Hankou Road to pick up the goods. Unexpectedly, at the Securities Building,

Elevator Crowded, When Hu Bingkui got out of the elevator on the fifth floor, he discovered that the draft was missing. He rushed back to the store to report. At that time, the plaintiff not only notified Zheng Xiang Money Exchange by telephone to declare the loss, but also submitted a written application, and published a detailed statement of the loss in both Shen and Xin newspapers, and reported the case to the police for record. Therefore, it is requested that the defendant Dingtai Yong Yin Bank be ordered to return the draft, etc. This case was concluded by Judge Li the day before yesterday, and a judgment is scheduled for the 26th of this month. The day before yesterday, Judge Ni continued the hearing, stating that after the deposit is secured pending the outcome of the case, whoever wins the lawsuit gets the money, which actually has nothing to do with the defendant. The court ordered a further hearing.

### Two Hand Grenades Exploded in Sanda Bookstore Fire; Police Took Shrapnel for Investigation

Sanda Bookstore, located at 331 Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession, has been open for less than a year. It specializes in selling Japanese books.

The Central Fire Brigade, being nearby, immediately rushed to the scene upon receiving the news and extinguished the fire in half an hour. Therefore, only the second floor and part of the facade were destroyed. During the fire, two hand grenades, ignited by the fire, suddenly exploded with a loud bang, scattering shrapnel in all directions, injuring a firefighter numbered 526 on his face and hands. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the police took away the shrapnel and investigated the source of the grenades.

### Major Theft Cases at Two Foreign Residences

The Continental Daily reported that detectives from the French Concession Police Department were investigating two major theft cases within the concession yesterday (the 22nd). The victims were the Deputy Manager of Citibank, Mr. Mackay, whose residence was burglarized of silverware worth approximately 29,000 yuan, and the British-Russian merchant Mr. Pronsky, whose residence was burglarized of approximately 30,000 yuan in cash. It is reported that Mr. Mackay has offered a reward of several thousand yuan to find the silverware and other household items stolen from his residence at No. 1931 Route Dufour. The two concessions have separately launched investigations into this case. Mr. Mackay has gone to Hong Kong, and his wife is currently in the United States. It is reported that the silverware and other items were stolen at night when his residence was empty. Mr. Pronsky, who resides at No. 1465 Route Lafayette, was robbed of approximately 30,000 yuan in US dollars and French currency a few nights ago. Detectives investigating this case have arrested the husband of Mr. Pronsky's maid and are interrogating him.

### Bomb Thrown into Gambling Den of United Overseas Chinese Association

The gambling den of the United Overseas Chinese Association at No. 6 Difeng Road in Shanghai West was suddenly attacked with a bomb at about 10 o'clock last night. The bomb exploded immediately, filling the area with thick smoke and scattering shrapnel in all directions. The gamblers, who were engrossed in their games, were startled by the loud noise and became extremely panicked, causing chaos. The bomber escaped into the confusion. Afterwards, the table attendants and security guards of the gambling den came out to maintain order and closed the iron gate for a search, but found nothing. It is reported that only a few people were hit by shrapnel in the face and went to the hospital for treatment.

### Young Woman Died of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning After Forgetting to Extinguish Coal Briquette Stove Before Bed

Liu, the wife of Wu Jixing, a painter from Anhui who lived at No. 152 Caishi Road in the French Concession, was 25 years old this year. She went to bed at 10 p.m. on the 22nd. After dinner, she forgot to extinguish the coal briquette stove used for cooking and left it in the room, causing her to fall into a coma from carbon monoxide poisoning after falling asleep. At 0:20 a.m. that night, Wu discovered her, reported to the police, and immediately sent her to Tzu Hospital. Because she had been poisoned deeply, she died before receiving treatment upon arrival at the hospital. The hospital notified the police, who sent the body to the Tongren Funeral Home to be claimed by her family today. According to reports in various newspapers, there have been many deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning in Shanghai this winter. This is the first case in the French Concession. It is hoped that everyone will warn their families not to leave coal stoves in the room for heating, which could lead to the loss of life.

### North China Daily News Cup Final: Youyou Lost to Russian Army Yesterday; 1-2, One Goal Each in First Half

The 1940-41 North China Daily News Cup football competition, contested by thirteen teams, saw Youyou and the Russian Army clash for the championship yesterday morning at the Recreation Ground. The crowd reached 5,000 people. As a result of the competition, Youyou, despite a strong offensive, suffered a narrow defeat of one to two, unfortunately handing the trophy to the Russian Army. This was very regrettable. The North China Daily News Cup was founded in 1924. Except for one suspension in 1931-32, Chinese teams have only won once in the past ten years, when Youyou won in 1936. This year, Youyou had a wealth of talent and a strong reputation. In yesterday's match, they adopted an aggressive offensive policy, with the ball mostly circulating in the Russian Army's area. However, Youyou's defeat yesterday was due to Zheng Tongyu's absence, which meant that the internal defense relied entirely on Zhang Lingen. After Zhang cleared the ball with a long kick, the opponent intercepted it, and Jiang Chao ran back too slowly, the danger was indeed unimaginable. Therefore, the first goal conceded yesterday (after 18 minutes) was a result of this. It was not until Lao Jin desperately rushed forward and equalized the score that it was almost half-time. In the second half, Youyou's offensive became even more vigorous. However, the Russian Army's left-back, Weisa Sige, blocked the incoming soldiers and stopped the incoming flood. Youyou's barrage of shots were all saved by this man. At the same time, the Russian Army's goalkeeper was also not weak. After about 20 minutes of stalemate, the Russian Army scored another goal. Although there was still some time afterwards, the overall situation was determined by a score of two to one. In yesterday's match, the Russian Army's victory was indeed fortunate, as Youyou controlled nine-tenths of the time. At yesterday's awards ceremony, Mr. Marshall, Vice President of the Far Eastern Football Association, presented the awards. The lineups of both sides were as follows:
