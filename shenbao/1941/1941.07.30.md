### Addressing the Tense Situation in the Far East: Democratic Nations Adopt Parallel Measures; Dutch East Indies Announces Abolition of Oil Agreement with Japan; Japan Economically Isolated

Reuters, Washington, 29th: Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States and Britain are taking peacetime measures in the Far East, consulting frequently to discuss their objectives, and exchanging views with other independent nations concerned with the Far East. Welles declined to elaborate on the U.S. policy regarding oil shipments to Japan under the President's freeze order. Welles denied the existence of an agreement to buy up all of Mexico's oil production, but stated optimistically about the future resolution of gasoline and other issues between the U.S. and Mexico.

Reuters, New York, 29th: British Ambassador to the U.S., Lord Halifax, visited Undersecretary of State Welles in Washington to discuss economic plans to be adopted towards Japan. The British Ambassador told reporters that the situation in the Far East needs to be re-evaluated following Japan's advance into Vietnam and the swift retaliatory actions by Britain and the U.S.

Reuters, Tokyo, 28th: According to reports from Batavia, the Dutch government has terminated the oil agreement concluded last year between the Dutch East Indies and Japan. Observers here are uncertain whether this move is merely a temporary response to the instability caused by the freezing of Japanese assets, or whether the Dutch East Indies plans to completely terminate the oil agreement to intensify its hostility towards Japan. However, they generally believe the Dutch East Indies is taking parallel action with Britain.

United Press, Tokyo, 29th: The "Asahi Shimbun" today strongly condemned the Dutch East Indies' move to freeze Japanese funds. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that this action is an undisguised rejection of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" built by Japan, and claimed that the Netherlands is participating in the encirclement of Japan. The newspaper said, "Japan must now take all necessary actions to address the problems caused by this move by the Netherlands. At the same time, it should destroy the Netherlands authorities' dream of despising Japan, who are wearing the skin of a British lion and the feathers of an American eagle."

United Press, Tokyo, 29th: The assets of Dutch and Dutch East Indies nationals in Japan have been frozen starting today. Currently, Japan's freezing action includes nationals of the U.S., the Philippines, Northern Ireland, Canada, Hong Kong, and the Dutch East Indies residing in Japan.

United Press, London, 29th: Indications received here yesterday suggest that democratic nations may implement commercial and financial restrictions against Japan leniently. Well-informed observers say the U.S. and the Dutch East Indies will continue to issue transport licenses to Japan. It is estimated that President Roosevelt's intention is primarily to warn Japan, and he does not wish to be too hasty and force Japan to war. Furthermore, Japanese officials in London stated that current measures in Tokyo are limited to retaliating against Britain, the U.S., and the Netherlands, and will be implemented leniently. Japan does not intend to take aggressive actions against Thailand, the Dutch East Indies, or U.S. territories, and is unlikely to invade the Shanghai International Settlement.

United Press, Tokyo, 9th: An official from the Ministry of Finance announced today that the relaxation of the freezing decree will depend on the circumstances. This indicates that Japan is temporarily not forming a definite policy, awaiting clarification of U.S. policy. Observers believe Japan will act according to the U.S. attitude: lenient if they are lenient, strict if they are strict.

United Press, Batavia, 29th: It was pointed out here today that the Japanese-Dutch currency agreement was officially terminated yesterday. This will result in the loss of 760,000 tons of unrefined oil and 546,000 tons of oil products annually, according to the Japanese-Dutch agreement signed last November. In the first four months of 1941, Japan purchased a total value of 29,600,000 Dutch guilders, likely exceeding last year's total of 101,000,000 tons. In the first four months of this year, the Dutch East Indies purchased goods from Japan worth 15,000,000 Dutch guilders.

Batavia, 28th: Japanese Consul-General to the Netherlands, Ishizawa, visited the Dutch East Indies Minister of Economic Affairs, Van Mook, at 12:30 PM on the 28th to hear his explanation regarding the issue of the President of the Java Bank, N. H. Aeckers, notifying the manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank branch, Imagawa, on the night of the 17th, to suspend the Japanese-Dutch East Indies financial agreement.

Reuters, Tokyo, 29th: Since the Dutch East Indies followed the lead of Britain and the U.S. in freezing Japanese funds, Japan is now economically completely isolated. Its only remaining trade partners are the areas on the Asian continent controlled by Japan. It is generally expected that this situation will be quietly endured for the time being, but once the adverse effects become apparent, an explosion will erupt. The Asahi Shimbun claims that the Dutch East Indies froze Japanese funds due to the difficulties caused by the U.S. action, ostensibly as a defensive measure, but in reality, it clearly intends to act in concert with Britain and the U.S. Funds in Japan will soon be frozen. As for British and Canadian assets in Japan, they have already been frozen.

Mutual Freezing of Funds Between India and Japan; Japanese Goods Will Be Hit

Reuters, Simla, 29th: Well-informed sources predict that the mutual freezing of assets by the Indian and Japanese governments will completely halt trade between India and Japan. In the year ending March 31st, India's exports to Japan totaled £675,206, while imports from Japan totaled £1,616,100. Although neither the Indian nor Japanese government's freezing orders mentioned trade, goods currently awaiting shipment or already paid for between the two countries are unlikely to be affected. The Indian government's order does not apply to Japanese goods already paid for and ordered. Currently, no commercial treaty exists between India and Japan, but the commercial agreement stipulates that Japan must purchase cotton from India equal to the value of Japanese textiles imported into India. Notice has been given that this stipulation will terminate in six months.

### Mobil Oil Company in Japan Stops Selling Oil

United Press, Tokyo, 29th: Mobil Oil Company stopped selling gasoline in Japan today because it has been unable to deposit payments received since the separate Japanese and U.S. travel freeze orders, and profits cannot be remitted. This move may only be temporary, pending clarification of the freezing decrees, but it will immediately cause greater hindrance to transportation in Japan. Well-informed sources expect taxis and private cars in Tokyo to decrease further, including those of the U.S. Embassy and consular officials. The government has reduced the amount of gasoline allocated to taxis for August to seven gallons.

### MacArthur Appointed Far East Commander; U.S. Senate Approves; MacArthur Discusses Integrating Philippine Army into U.S. Army with Quezon; U.S. Newspapers Express Satisfaction with MacArthur's Appointment

Reuters, Manila, 29th: General MacArthur, after discussing the integration of the Philippine Army into the U.S. Army with Philippine President Quezon yesterday, assumed the position of Commander of the U.S. Army in the Far East. It is believed that the Philippine Army's 1st Division and the chiefs of the Philippine constabulary will be integrated into the U.S. Army. The Philippines is scheduled to hold elections in November, at which time political activities are supposed to be lively, but this activity has been greatly relaxed due to the tense situation in the Far East. Members of Congress advocate convening a special session to amend the National Defense Act to limit reserve duty to 30 days of military drills per year. President Quezon recently telegraphed U.S. Secretary of War Stimson, welcoming the appointment of General MacArthur and declaring the Philippines' willingness to cooperate with the U.S. Leaders of the Socialist Party also jointly published an article declaring their support for the U.S. and their willingness to resist the enemies of the democratic nations under General MacArthur's command. Rumor has it that the U.S.-Japan Gentleman's Agreement, limiting the import of Japanese cotton goods into the Philippines, has been cancelled. U.S. officials stationed in the Philippines did not comment on this, only stating that the agreement will expire on August 1st.

United Press, Washington, 29th: Yesterday, the Washington Post's editorial stated that Lieutenant General MacArthur's appointment as Commander of the Far East Command is a warning to Japan. It also stated that President Roosevelt's move is a further warning in an emergency situation. If this is not enough, then the U.S. will defend its interests in the Far East. The Baltimore Sun's editorial stated that this appointment to the Philippine Army is sufficient to influence Japan or may sober Tokyo, because at this time, the Far East desperately needs sobriety and determination.

Reuters, Washington, 29th: The U.S. Senate yesterday unanimously approved the appointment of General MacArthur as a Lieutenant General to command the U.S. Army in the Philippines.

Reuters, Washington, 29th: Former Chief of Naval Operations Stanley claimed that the U.S. Navy is now prepared to assist in the defense of the Pacific and provide ample assistance to Britain to enable it to win the war in the Atlantic. Senator Pepper, a staunch supporter of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, expressed satisfaction with the President's appointment of General MacArthur as Commander of the U.S. Army in the Far East, stating that if Japan thinks it can march into the Philippines as easily as it did into Vietnam, it will encounter unexpected developments.

### U.S. Permits Japanese Ships to Export Freely; Not Affected by Freeze Order; Japanese Ship Leaves Canada with Timber

Reuters, Washington, 29th: The U.S. has recently notified Japan that Japanese ships are permitted to depart quickly from U.S. ports. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Nomura, told reporters before visiting Undersecretary of State Welles to discuss the freezing of Japanese assets in the U.S. that he knows Japanese ships are not affected by the freeze order. He hopes the State Department will clarify this and other issues.

International News Service, San Francisco, 29th: Forty Japanese ships, including the "Tatsuta Maru," which had been hesitating in the Pacific, afraid of being detained by the U.S., heard their destinations this morning. Welles has announced that Japanese ships are permitted to unload cargo in U.S. ports. The "Tatsuta Maru" carries raw silk worth $3.9 million and is destined for San Francisco.

Reuters, San Francisco, 29th: Japanese ships lingering off the coast are hesitant to enter U.S. ports. Some of them, including the "Tatsuta Maru," want assurances from the U.S. government that their cargo will not be detained. It is believed here that most Japanese ships must be lacking fuel and food. It is heard that the "Tatsuta Maru" carries a total of 59 British passengers, including the naval attaché of the British Embassy in Tokyo, Dufrenil, 32 Americans, and 139 Japanese.

International News Service, Vancouver, 29th: The Japanese ship "Florida Maru" left Vancouver yesterday carrying timber. This proves that although Canada has issued a freeze order, commerce between Japan and Canada has not been completely paralyzed. The Canadian authorities did not make any criticism when the ship left port. At the same time, customs officials are unloading cargo from the Panamanian ship "Boyaz," which, according to investigations, is carrying Canadian wheat intended for the occupied areas of China.

United Press, Singapore, 29th: Sources here claimed yesterday that the Japanese ship "Matsumoto Maru" is still near Singapore, awaiting further clarification of the situation resulting from the British freezing of Japanese funds. An employee of the Nissin Company here said that the Hakone Maru will pass through here on Tuesday en route to Bombay. All of the ship's tickets were purchased by those departing from Singapore, making it the last Japanese ship to carry Japanese residents returning home.

Reuters, Bombay, 29th: The Japanese ships "Momebato Maru" and "Tomokawa Maru," scheduled to arrive here on a certain date, have not yet arrived. Their Bombay management office is trying to find out the reason for the ships' delay.

### British and Canadian Assets of Chinese Frozen; This Move is at the Request of China; To Strengthen Chinese Finances

Havas, London, 28th: Following the lead of the United States, the British government, at the request of the Chinese government, has frozen Chinese assets in Britain. According to an official announcement made tonight, in order to aid China's financial position, the British Treasury, at the request of the Chinese government, has ordered the freezing of all pound sterling deposits and various assets in Britain belonging to residents in China. This order will take effect tomorrow morning. However, necessary funds for payments and various important transactions related to the Chinese government in the gold sterling group countries may still be withdrawn under special authorization.

Japanese Ministry of the Army Establishes Recruiting Office

Reuters, Tokyo, 29th: Authorities announced that the Ministry of the Army has established a recruiting office to manage recruiting affairs, disseminate national defense knowledge regarding reservists, conduct school military training, and provide relief to retired soldiers.

New Zealand Takes Same Action as Britain and the U.S.

Reuters, Washington, 29th: Acting Prime Minister Nash announced that the New Zealand government is currently taking the same action towards Japan as Britain and the U.S., as New Zealand fully agrees with the actions taken by Britain and the U.S. New Zealand's exchange controls and trade regulations enable the necessary steps to be implemented in a simple and rapid manner. The New Zealand government has notified Japan that the New Zealand-Japan Commercial Treaty of 1819 will cease to be in effect three months after notification. Nash further discussed the impact of this step on Japan, stating that there will be a tense period ahead, but the New Zealand government has been in constant consultation with the British and other dominion governments. Today's decision may not result in a complete cessation of exchange transactions, but in order to ensure complete cooperation, it is hoped that every transaction, including those already underway, will be subject to scrutiny. Restrictions on remittances will be implemented immediately, which will bring trade with Japan to a near standstill, but the government does not intend to abolish the existing import and export licensing system.

Dutch East Indies Abolishing Agreement Highly Praised by the U.S.

United Press, Washington, 29th: Political figures here yesterday greatly praised Batavia's request for economic retaliation against Japan. This move was especially welcomed because it can serve as a solid front of resistance for many countries that have a significant stake in the critical South Asian region, where Japan is eager to expand its aggression. The current impression here is extremely strong that the countries in this region with a stake will form a united front against Japan's southward advance. At the same time, a warning has been issued to Japan that if Japan moves forward again, they will offer stronger resistance. According to experts, if Japan attacks the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, it will encounter a joint and unanimous pressure from all countries.

Reuters, Davia, 29th: A spokesman for the Dutch East Indies government told the Legislative Council yesterday regarding changes in commercial relations between the Dutch East Indies and Japan that they will now seek to investigate what kind of barter trade the Dutch East Indies can conduct with Japan after developments in Vietnam, and investigate what basis this trade can be conducted on. It must be repeatedly stated that the Dutch East Indies government does not want to hinder Japan's business activities in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies government will pay as much attention as possible to this point when issuing necessary licenses for exports to Japan and Japanese-controlled areas.

Batavia, 28th: The Dutch East Indies government announced on the 28th the termination of the 1940 Japanese-Dutch oil agreement.

Japanese Privy Council Discusses Countermeasures Against Britain and the U.S.

International News Service, Tokyo, 29th: The Japanese Privy Council met yesterday to decide how to deal with the economic war against Britain and the U.S. Finance Minister Ogura said that Japan's policy will depend on the actions of the U.S. government. It is heard that the Emperor also attended the meeting. The meeting lasted four hours, and government officials were questioned in detail on various issues. It was also revealed that the Japanese government acknowledged that it will use eight airfields in Vietnam, one of which is near Angkor, bordering Thailand.

### Dutch East Indies Joins British and U.S. Front; Japan is Encircled; Will No Longer Be Able to Find Gasoline; Attacking Burma Also Faced with Many Difficulties

Reuters, London, 29th: The "Daily Telegraph" editorial today stated that the leaders of the Japanese military's advance into Vietnam knew that it would eventually cause consequences, but due to their recklessness, they could not heed good advice. However, those with clear heads in the country are deeply worried about the future. Since the Dutch East Indies joined the British and U.S. plan, the circle surrounding the Japanese military has actually been completed. Japan's future raw material needs are almost entirely dependent on Manchuria, China, and Vietnam, but these three places generally lack certain necessities of war, especially gasoline. It continued to discuss the retaliatory actions taken by Japan, saying that it is difficult for Japan to find any way to avoid suffocation, even resorting to force. However, unless its navy can control the South China Sea and occupy the East Indies and Thailand, it will be of no help. As for whether this new blockade will drive Japan to use force against the democratic nations, it remains to be seen. The "News Chronicle" published an article stating that Japan, which intended to accumulate war supplies in peacetime, may not wait until these war supplies are exhausted before engaging in acquiring hegemony in the Far East. Therefore, there may soon be action, or there may never be action. If it decides to stake its future on a gamble in the Pacific, it will find that the democratic nations are all prepared to wait.

Reuters, , 29th: The Times today published an article titled "Burma If Attacked," written by the newspaper's correspondent in Burma, which stated that Japan has long studied the possibility of attacking Burma from bases in Southeast Asia, which Japan can easily establish. The objective of this attack is mostly the Burma Road. During China's resistance war, the Japanese military was largely constrained and difficult to mobilize. It is estimated that their attack will likely pass through northern Thailand and advance along the Ledo Road (transliteration). If this succeeds, it can cut off important traffic to the south and then advance into Xipaw (transliteration) to control the road to Lashio and China. If the Japanese military attacks from the east, it will encounter natural obstacles, as the rainy season begins in this area in May, extending for six months, with rivers overflowing and towering mountain ranges and valleys intertwined, ranging from 800 to 8,000 feet above sea level. There are very few roads near the border, and those that exist are constantly available year-round. The Japanese military authorities are well aware of the geographical difficulties they will encounter, but they do not know the strength of the military they will encounter. In recent months, the military and equipment have greatly increased. This area is confident that it can prevent invasion. Anyone who wants to cut off China's traffic must attack northern Burma. Because the enemy may not necessarily attack from the north, Burma has long paid attention to this. However, the most serious danger is the advance through northern Thailand, the bombing of Bhamo and Lashio, and the attack from the sky. This offensive is not conducive to Burma, especially if the large number of supplies stockpiled in Bhamo and Lashio or road traffic are destroyed. The authorities have made every effort to strengthen the defense of this important location, but constant attention must be paid, as major is critical to the maintenance of China's lifeline.

### Citibank in Tokyo Continues to Suspend Operations

United Press, Tokyo, 29th: Citibank here is still pretending that officials from the Ministry of Finance are continuing to examine the bank's books. Deputy spokesman for the Cabinet Information Bureau Ishii declared that the bank will be allowed to resume operations, but the date is not yet set. The bank holds 17 million yen in Japanese currency belonging to U.S. depositors, 8 million yen of which belongs to U.S. film companies. U.S. film companies jointly decided today to unanimously stop supplying films in various parts of Japan, pending clarification of the freezing decrees. The Ministry of Finance told various inquirers that the limit for monthly withdrawals for people from countries whose funds have been frozen is no more than 500 yen, and so far, there have been no exceptions, nor has it been indicated whether there will be exceptions.

### Economic Blockade and War

In the 20th century, no country in the world can exist in isolation from international resource communication. In 1935, when Italy invaded Abyssinia, British representative Eden launched an economic sanction against Italy in the League of Nations, but it failed. However, at that time, the Italian authorities had already shown a very panicked state. During the Spanish Civil War, Franco's victory in 1939 was due to the rebels' complete occupation of all seaports, coupled with the complete blockade by Britain and France of overseas aid to the government forces. As for the last European War, Germany's ultimate collapse was entirely due to the strict blockade by the Allied forces, which is universally recognized. Taking Japan as an example, it can actually establish a fairly strong military organization in such a resource-poor and narrow region. Its materials naturally come mostly from overseas: military plunder and economic competition are carried out simultaneously. The Sino-Japanese War has been fought for more than four years now, and it can still sustain itself because of the material replenishment exchanged through trade, the most important of which comes from the US, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies. If they had cut off the supply of raw materials to Japan earlier, it would be questionable how long Japan's limited reserves and resources could last.

The Western countries, Germany and Italy, attacked the Soviet Union due to miscalculations, and are now trapped in a desperate situation, completing a tight blockade circle for themselves. Their fate of failure is already doomed, it is only a matter of time. And their Eastern ally is now repeating the same mistake, disregarding the repeated warnings of Britain and the United States, and brazenly occupying Vietnam, which in one fell swoop triggered unanimous economic sanctions from Britain, the United States, the Dutch East Indies, etc. Originally, with the strong economic power of the US, British, and Dutch East Indies groups, the severity of this unanimous sanction against a country like Japan that completely relies on trade can be imagined. Just by looking at the complete stagnation of Japan's overseas shipping industry in the past two days, the fluctuations in the hearts of the people in its own country and its controlled areas, and the complete chaos in market prices, etc., one can immediately know. If the situation continues in the future, even setting aside military matters, economically, it will inevitably face a complete collapse one day.

However, in view of the rapid and profound effectiveness of this economic sanction against Japan, there seem to be two impressions that one cannot help but have: First, it is a pity that this sanction was not implemented earlier, otherwise, it would be questionable whether the world's aggressive forces could be as rampant as they are now. Second, this economic sanction, which has already been formally announced, is limited to the freezing of funds and the restriction of trade, and does not thoroughly implement a comprehensive economic severance and blockade, which is a shortcoming. From the perspective of the timing of the sanctions, at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, some people in the United States advocated economic sanctions against Japan to force it to abandon its aggression; and for four years, warnings have been constantly issued to Japan, urging it to respect the interests of the United States in the Pacific, otherwise, the United States would not need to resort to military action to put it in a difficult situation. However, why was this most effective weapon only taken out when the situation became so urgent today, instead of being used earlier? The United States cannot deny its responsibility for this delay. Now that economic sanctions have finally been implemented, the United States has made the greatest determination, and further measures can be implemented at any time. When the German military machine, which was invincible in military affairs and thought itself invincible, was once trapped in a tight blockade, it still presented a declining and inevitable defeat. Not to mention other smaller aggressive countries. Here, the Soviet Union's current firm action against Germany can serve as a reference for the United States. In the Pacific, there is no doubt that the only country that is qualified to imitate the Soviet Union's strong approach to combating aggressors in Europe is the United States.

Of course, because of the firm actions taken by Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies against aggressive forces, a cloud of war has emerged in the Pacific again. However, it seems too early to judge whether this cloud will bring storms or simply dissipate with the wind. Judging only from the situation, the most likely situation for the United States to be dragged into the war is when the Eastern and Western aggressive forces actually connect and join hands. To be specific, if Germany captures Suez and advances towards India, and at the same time Japan begins to move south and attack Singapore and other places, or if Germany captures Moscow and Leningrad, and Japan attacks Siberia, once these two situations occur, the United States will inevitably have to stand up and fight. However, the current actual situation is that not only is it difficult for the two groups of aggressive forces in the East and West to actually connect into one, but also the Western aggressors have already suffered unprecedented setbacks and are trapped in the core of a strong military and economic double barrier, and there is absolutely no way to break through the encirclement. Therefore, at this time, no matter what firm actions the United States takes in the East, given its powerful national strength, it would be truly beyond common sense to say that the Eastern aggressive forces would come to blows with it! Therefore, thoroughly economically blockading the aggressors in the East and West on the one hand, and making every effort to provide larger-scale assistance to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union on the other hand, while mobilizing the navy, army, and air force to prepare for a war at all costs, these are the most reliable ways to keep the United States from being dragged into the vortex of war and to end the world war early.

Harbin: Funds of British and American citizens deposited in banks within the four northeastern provinces have been frozen since yesterday. All banks have received notices that British and American deposits cannot be withdrawn without special permission. (Associated Press, 29th)

Tianjin: The Japanese Consul-General here issued a notice yesterday stating that, as retaliation for the British and American freezing of Japanese funds, all transactions involving Japanese, American, Filipino, and British citizens are under the control of the Japanese consulate.

(Associated Press, 29th)

Freezing Chinese Funds Highly Beneficial to China

Chongqing: Regarding the British and American freezing of Japanese funds and the simultaneous freezing of Chinese funds, a reporter interviewed an official from the Ministry of Finance. The official stated that since the beginning of the War of Resistance, China has been unable to thoroughly manage foreign exchange due to its special circumstances, which has been exploited by speculators and capital flight. The government has repeatedly negotiated with friendly countries for assistance to achieve effective foreign exchange management. Now, friendly governments, at our request, have frozen our funds abroad. The meaning of this is completely different from freezing Japanese funds. Although our funds have been frozen, they can still be supplied by designated banks for legitimate purposes, and capital flight is prevented. Japanese funds cannot be disguised under Chinese names to evade restrictions. Therefore, this move by friendly governments is of great benefit to increasing China's foreign trade and managing foreign exchange. It further demonstrates the sincerity of friendly countries in assisting us. This matter concerns national interests, and our people can understand the significance of this move by friendly countries. Our financial and economic foundation will also become more stable from now on. (28th dispatch)

### Joint Defense of Vietnam, Franco-Japanese Agreement Signed, Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Land in Cam Ranh Bay, All Key Vietnamese Bases Occupied

Havas Agency, Vichy, 29th: The Franco-Japanese Protocol was signed here at 11:00 a.m. this morning. The French representative was Cabinet Counselor and Foreign Minister Darlan, and the Japanese representative was the Japanese Ambassador to France, Kato. This protocol is the political foundation for the technical measures that France and Japan should take to jointly defend Vietnam. The full text is as follows: "The governments of France and Japan, in view of the current international situation, and recognizing that if the security of French Vietnam is threatened, Japan has reason to believe that the general peace of East Asia and the security of Japan itself are facing a crisis. Both sides take this opportunity to reaffirm the obligations previously accepted, namely, Japan promises to respect France's rights and interests in the Far East, especially the territorial integrity of Vietnam and France's sovereignty over all of Vietnam. As for France, it promises not to conclude agreements or understandings with any third country regarding Vietnam that stipulate methods of cooperation in political, economic, or military terms that would directly or indirectly put it in a position of opposition to Japan. It is therefore resolved as follows:

(1) The governments of France and Japan agree to cooperate militarily to jointly defend French Vietnam. (2) Special measures should be established to implement the measures to be taken for this cooperation. (3) The above regulations shall continue to be effective only during the period when the circumstances for their adoption exist."

Reuters, Hanoi, 29th: Japanese troops landed in southern Vietnam yesterday. Official notices have been seen, but the number is unknown. It is known that the landing point is Nha Trang, which is located north of Cam Ranh Bay, which is also the location of one of the eight airfields that the new Franco-Japanese agreement allows Japan to occupy.

Reuters, Tokyo, 29th: The South China Fleet Information Office announced today that the Japanese South China Fleet carrying Japanese army troops has sailed to the vicinity of a certain place in Vietnam today. The French authorities treated the Japanese troops in a most friendly atmosphere. Local residents hung Japanese flags.

Reuters, Hanoi, 29th: According to official announcements, Japan is now stationing 40,000 troops in southern Vietnam.

Associated Press, Saigon, 29th: Japanese transport ships and destroyers approached Cape St. Jacques this afternoon, and several warships have approached Cam Ranh Bay. It is generally expected that Japanese troops can land in Saigon and other naval bases today, but the Japanese army may have to wait until tomorrow to land in Saigon because the ships must wait for the tide tomorrow morning. Preparations have been made here this morning to welcome the Japanese troops. The docks and warehouses have mostly been cleared to allow the Japanese army to use them immediately.

### ### Vichy Issues Statement to Cover Up Submission to Japan

Havas Agency, Vichy, 28th: After France and Japan reached an agreement on the Vietnam issue, an official statement was issued as follows: "Although Japan is allowed to temporarily borrow the pier facilities of Haiphong port and concentrate troops and military supplies in certain places in Tonkin based on the Franco-Japanese agreement of September 5, 1940, this does not mean cession. Taking Haiphong as an example, although the Japanese army is allowed to borrow the pier gangways and various means of transportation within the prescribed period, the military and political power is still in the hands of France. There is a difference between cession and borrowing. Cession means the transfer of all sovereignty. As for borrowing, all sovereignty only changes with local and temporary influence. In addition, the invasion of Syria and the Vietnam incident are not related. As far as Syria is concerned, the British side carried out the attack without prior consultation with the French government and openly announced its intention to drive the French army out of Syria, and is now putting this intention into practice. Japan is the opposite. It explained its views in advance and conducted friendly negotiations with us to find an agreement. It solemnly declared that it would recognize the territorial integrity of Vietnam and France's sovereignty over all of Vietnam both at present and in the future. In other words, the country is deeply concerned about the disputes in the South Seas and asked us to provide convenience in military strategy and military affairs to protect its economy because Japan needs Vietnamese rice to maintain its people's food. To sum up, the convenience requested by Japan will take the following forms in the near future: (1) The Japanese army will be transferred from Tonkin to Annam and Cochin China. (2) The Japanese army will use Vietnamese highways and railways, for a period of several days. (3) The Japanese army will use various entrances in Vietnam. (4) Japanese troops will be stationed at locations selected by both sides. The above are the military impacts of the Franco-Japanese agreement. External propaganda intends to disrupt our people's minds, and the true situation should be told to the national media to clarify the truth."

### ### Latin America to Launch Economic Offensive Against Japan, Based on the Pan-American Cooperation Agreement, Making it Impossible for Japan to Obtain Raw Materials

Associated Press, Washington, 29th: Undersecretary of State Welles said yesterday that Latin America may cooperate with the United States in launching an economic offensive against Japan based on the current agreement between the United States and the American republics. At the same time, President Roosevelt, now at Hyde Park, has decided to return to Washington immediately to closely monitor the actions taken by the United States against Japan's expansion in the Pacific. The President is scheduled to arrive here on Sunday morning and intends to hold talks with Mr. Welles. Welles said that the agreement made by the United States is to purchase surplus military materials from Latin America and prevent certain goods shipped from the United States from being directly exported to other countries. The Undersecretary of State also said that this agreement makes it very difficult for Japan to obtain supplies from Latin America, but Japan has purchased cotton from Peru in the past and other raw materials from Brazil. Welles said that the United States and other interested parties exchange opinions from time to time and maintain contact to take parallel actions at any time to deal with Japan's actions in the South Pacific. The Undersecretary of State declined to comment on whether Japan may be able to purchase oil from Venezuela and other Latin American countries. He said that each country is an independent and free country and may act in accordance with its own national policies. Welles acknowledged that the United States has an agreement with Mexico to purchase all of the latter's surplus oil.

### ### German Consul Expelled from San Francisco Transferred to Yokohama

International News Agency, Berlin, 29th: It is reported here that Captain Weitmann, the German Consul in San Francisco, will soon go to Yokohama to assume the position of Consul General after arriving here from the United States. Mr. Wei arrived in Lisbon from New York, then took a special car to here and then met with Ribbentrop. It is expected that after Mr. Wei is transferred to Yokohama as Consul General, the Nazis will increase pressure on the Japanese government and make Japan clearly express its opposition to democratic countries. It is rumored that Mr. Wei is a close friend of Führer Hitler and one of the most active Nazis stationed abroad. Mr. Wei's deployment to Japan shows that the German government attaches great importance to the Far Eastern situation.

### Red Army on All Fronts Launches Large-Scale Counter-Offensive; Army and Air Force Cooperate to Inflict Heavy Damage on the Enemy; Moscow and Kyiv Turn from Danger to Safety

Reuters, Moscow, 29th. Soviet sources recently announced that in the central sector of the Rzhev-Vyazma-Bryansk area (directly facing Moscow) and the southern front of the Tomilka area (directly facing Kyiv), German forces are being strongly resisted by Soviet troops, and their offensive is now cracking. Soviet forces are now launching fierce counter-offensives in many places, inflicting heavy damage on enemy forces. However, there are no other significant battles to report in other areas. The Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with the Army, attacked concentrated large groups of enemy troops and enemy aircraft on airfields. On July 26th, 101 German aircraft were shot down, and the Soviets lost 36 aircraft. Coastal defense forces and naval aviation in the Baltic region sank one enemy torpedo boat and two patrol boats. The Soviets also lost one large torpedo boat.

Reuters, London, 29th. Soviet sources reported that fierce fighting continued in the Smolensk, Tomilka, and Nevel areas. The news is essentially no different from yesterday's announcements. The Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with ground troops, continued to attack important enemy concentrations. News regarding the siege of Leningrad is contradictory. German sources claim that the Leningrad area has been surrounded, and Finnish forces have advanced to the outskirts of the city. However, a Swiss newspaper reporter stated that German forces operating south of Leningrad have been forced to retreat to Novgorod. Strong reserve forces have joined the battle, and German and Finnish forces are still at least 90 kilometers away from Leningrad. According to neutral sources heard by Reuters, the Germans underestimated the enemy's strength and are now experiencing supply shortages.

Reuters, Zurich, 29th. The "Basler Nachrichten" reported from Berlin that the most intense fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front has undoubtedly come to a standstill. Messages from the front lines indicate that German infantry are forced to hold their positions in trenches to defend against Soviet counter-offensives. On July 7th, the German Army High Command announced that the Soviets had deployed their last reserves. Now, the German side is contradicting itself, saying, "Soviet forces have recently received reinforcements from the Ural region." To further explain this, it stated, "The previous German announcement naturally did not include the Ural region." The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung explained the reason for the German offensive being stalled, stating, "The great battle against the strongest Bolshevik forces is currently underway, so that the German Army can continue its war operations." Two weeks ago, the Basler Nachrichten reported from Berlin that Berlin expected Kyiv to fall within "a few hours." However, Kyiv remains unharmed.

### Northern Red Army Well-Commanded, Half of Enemy Division Annihilated

TASS, War Zone Report, 29th. On June 29th, a German-Finnish infantry division began an offensive in a certain area "attempting to seize it." The battle lasted until July 11th. The enemy's repeated attacks were defeated by the forces commanded by Army Colonel Trubachev. The war lasted for 13 days, and the result was a complete victory for the Soviet troops. Half of the advancing enemy force was annihilated. The enemy not only failed to occupy the objective but also had to gather its remaining troops and flee. Army Colonel Trubachev is a veteran of the Civil War, who has repeatedly demonstrated courage and set an example, inspiring Red Army soldiers. This battle further proves him to be a resolute and strong-willed Red Army commander. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has specially awarded him the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union."

United Press, Stockholm, 29th. Yesterday, local news reports reported the sound of heavy artillery fire, believed to indicate naval warfare between Germany and the Soviet Union, or the Soviet bombing of German positions along the Estonian coast. In Gotland, clear sounds of artillery fire have been heard every five to ten minutes since Sunday.

### Difficult Terrain in Forest Areas, Nazis Admit to Arduous Combat

Reuters, Zurich, 29th. Official German sources explain the slow progress on the Eastern Front by citing the difficulties encountered by the German forces. A Berlin dispatch from a newspaper in Bern described the situation on the Soviet-Finnish front: "On this front, German troops, heavily laden, advance in columns, winding through seemingly endless forests. There are no roads for transportation in the forests, and motorized vehicles are not suitable. Therefore, the troops carry only the absolutely necessary equipment. Although the nights are very cold, the troops do not carry coats or blankets. During the day, it is hot and humid, and swarms of mosquitoes fly around, causing the troops considerable suffering. They are also often hindered by mud, sinking to their knees. These forests provide the best cover for the Soviet forces, which the German forces cannot see. Therefore, as soon as the German troops enter the forest, they are quickly ambushed by Soviet forces hidden in the thickets. Another difficulty is the excellent camouflage of the Soviet artillery positions, making them difficult to detect from afar. Mines are buried everywhere around the artillery positions."

### Eastern Front Warfare at a Standstill, German Timetable Useless

International News Service, Istanbul, 29th. A well-informed foreign military expert here told reporters yesterday that the German forces have lost at least 6,000 armored vehicles and 700,000 soldiers in this all-out attack on the Soviet Union. He stated, "I can assert that Soviet resistance has completely overturned German calculations and shattered their plans. Several months ago, I learned that the German High Command was ordered to estimate the time required for the invasion of the Soviet Union. The High Command replied that a complete breakthrough would be achieved three weeks after the launch, and the entire campaign would be completed in at most six weeks. Today, I strongly disbelieve the estimates of these generals. I believe the Soviet Union still has more troops to deploy to the battlefield. Although the Germans claim to have occupied the important Soviet town of Smolensk, the area still appears to be the center of a major battle. The Germans have admitted to Soviet counter-offensives, which indicates that the Soviet forces still hold positions, and their combat effectiveness is not weak. The Soviet forces have equipment that is not inferior to the German forces, and they are able to mobilize more forces."

### German Aircraft Attack Soviet Capital Again Unsuccessful, Port of Odessa Continues to Be Attacked

Reuters, Moscow, 29th. According to TASS, a total of 140-150 German aircraft attacked Moscow on Monday night. Their formations were dispersed by the combined Soviet anti-aircraft fire and night pursuit aircraft, so only four or five aircraft slipped into the city. According to initial reports, nine German aircraft were shot down, and the Soviets lost one aircraft. The German aircraft that reached the city dropped bombs indiscriminately, causing a fire in one place, which was quickly extinguished. Several people were killed and wounded.

Havas, Berlin, 28th. Official sources announced tonight that the German Air Force bombed the Soviet port of Odessa in southern Ukraine several times last night. The docks there were hit and caught fire.

### Churchill Warns the Nation Not to Relax Vigilance; Naval and Air Forces Hold Dominant Positions, Production of War Equipment Proceeding According to Plan

Reuters, London, 29th. Prime Minister Churchill, speaking in the House of Commons today, warned the British people that the enemy's invasion season is approaching again, and all armed forces must be vigilant in a timely manner. The Prime Minister also stated that it is indeed a fact that the German air superiority has been shattered. British fighters are now in a better position than during the Battle of Britain. The production of bombers in Britain alone has doubled, and next year it will double again, and in the six months after that, it will triple the current output. In the past three months, the production of munitions has increased by one-third compared to the Dunkirk era. Currently, the tonnage of warships and merchant ships being built is greater than at any time during the last World War.

Reuters, London, 29th. Prime Minister Churchill, beginning the production debate in the House of Commons today, declared that although we are not an omnipotent nation, we are now working to make ourselves a complete war machine. Rumors that any confusion has occurred in British war equipment production are untrue. In the first three months of this year, in his capacity as Minister of Defense, he drafted and revised a general plan for the War Cabinet, bringing together the entire program for the production and import of British munitions and indicating the path it should follow. He discussed this plan with various cabinet members and the leaders of the three armed forces and had it studied by statisticians. This general plan was finally given final approval by the War Cabinet in March of this year. He can guarantee that the various agencies controlling production currently have no disputes over the priority rights of labor, raw materials, and factories. As for the fact that some planes ordered from the United States could not be used because they did not have accessories, as was said during the last debate, it is not true. It must be known that the planes ordered by Britain are accompanied by various parts. This misunderstanding was largely caused by the fact that after the collapse of France, the British aircraft production department received a batch of aircraft ordered by France, all of which were not suitable for use in Britain. They could only be used after being refitted.

### Britain Determined Not to Easily Make Peace with Germany; Eden Delivers Speech

Reuters, London, 29th. Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in London today, saying that Germany seems likely to launch a "peace blitz" against Britain soon, but any peace concluded with Hitler will be difficult to make permanent. We are determined to destroy Hitler's regime and hope that the United States will cooperate with us after the war to jointly maintain the peace we have achieved. Hitler's timetable for defeating the Soviet Union has lost its usefulness.

### Britain Severs Relations with Finland

Havas, London, 28th. The Foreign Office has just announced that Britain has severed diplomatic relations with Finland.

Reuters, London, 29th. Responsible sources in London claim that Finland has requested the severance of diplomatic relations with Britain. The Finnish Foreign Minister recently presented a supplementary memorandum to the British Minister to Finland, stating that since Finland is fighting alongside Germany, normal diplomatic relations between Britain and Finland can hardly be maintained. The British Minister then asked if this meant that Finland was requesting the severance of diplomatic relations, to which the Finnish Foreign Minister replied in the affirmative.

### Huge U.S. National Defense Budget, Totaling 80 Billion Yuan, Passed by the House and Sent to the Senate

Reuters, Washington, 29th. The U.S. $8,063,000,000 national defense appropriation bill was passed by the House last night and sent to the Senate. It includes funds for the equipment and supplies of 1,727,000 Army personnel and $4,760,000,000 for the emergency recruitment of 3,000,000 personnel. In addition to $1,569,000,000 for the Navy Department, the Foreign Affairs Committee also received $1,609,000,000 to build 541 cargo ships and acquire 350 ships.

### Hess' Confidant, Haushofer, Commits Suicide

Reuters, London, 29th. Wireless dispatches from Moscow state that according to reliable sources in Geneva, Professor Karl Haushofer, Hitler's right-hand man, the National Socialist Party's mastermind, and the inventor of terms such as "Lebensraum" (living space) and "Führer," has committed suicide in a concentration camp in Bavaria. Since the 1920s, Haushofer had influence over Hitler, but since Hess fled to England, Haushofer was placed under house arrest and soon transferred to a concentration camp. It is said that Haushofer made many contributions to the political theories in Hitler's book "Mein Kampf." In his youth, Haushofer traveled throughout Europe, India, Siberia, China, and Japan.

### Implementation of Frozen Funds; American Banks Receive Instructions; Maintain Normal Operations and Continue to Purchase Foreign Currencies; Regulations for Applying for Foreign Exchange for Trade

Since the UK and the US successively announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds, banks of friendly nations in Shanghai initially kept silent on the matter. As for implementation methods, they stated they hadn't received orders from their governments, so they couldn't make announcements. However, American commercial banks received Implementation Instructions No. 58 and No. 59 yesterday morning. The frozen funds implementation measures stipulated are stricter than most people previously anticipated. As for the special note concerning Sino-American trade, it doesn't mean that the four authorized banks can freely provide exchange for trade; it only provides exchange for normal American imports and exports. The policy of American commercial banks in this city is to continue to purchase foreign currencies from sellers of any nationality to avoid the situation from fundamentally changing from what it was last Saturday morning, when the freezing order was issued. Banking circles believe that the exchange market situation is still "more buying" because most importers are eager to obtain American goods.

Restricting Measures

American commercial banks received general notes No. 58 and No. 59, which were issued respectively based on the freezing of American exchange funds for China and Chinese funds in the United States. Under these instructions, Chinese funds will be frozen or blocked. As for general note No. 58 concerning the freezing of American exchange funds for China, it stipulates that "A" trade in any part of the United States and China (excluding Manchuria) must meet the following conditions:

(1) This kind of trade must not be operated by, or entrusted to be managed by, or be related to (1) blocked countries other than China, or (2) people living in Manchuria, or (3) people of blocked countries other than China (not including those living in China).

(2) This kind of trade must not involve the interests or property of blocked countries (excluding China), the people of Manchuria today, or people of blocked countries other than China (excluding those living in China) (from the effective date of the instructions or at any time).

(3) Trade applying for foreign exchange must meet the following two conditions: (1) This kind of trade must be bona fide imports and exports, legal and normal, and the value of its imports or exports must be equivalent to the total amount of foreign exchange applied for; (2) This kind of import and export must comply with all the provisions of this note.

"B" Banks in the United States that have been approved and authorized by this note must immediately maintain a monthly report from the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, which contains the details of the trade regulations during this period, including the detailed rules related to this type of trade, including evidence methods for loan accounts related to this type of trade.

"C" The people referred to in this note as "living in China" refer to those who have been in China and doing business in China since June 14, 1941.

(1) The banks authorized to operate this kind of trade under special notes are Chase Bank, Citibank, American Allied Bank, American Express, Moscow National Bank, Commerzbank, HSBC, Banque de l'Indochine, David Sassoon & Co., New Sassoon, Mercantile Bank, Dutch Bank, Banca dell'Asia, and Davidsassoon & Co., a total of fourteen banks. (2) The banks specially approved by this note are authorized to provide foreign exchange for trade between any part of China (excluding Manchuria) and the following countries: (1) the United States, (2) the Americas (as stipulated in Note No. 93), (3) the British Empire, (4) the Soviet Union, and (5) the Dutch East Indies.

Foreign Commercial Banks Maintain Shanghai Exchange Rates

The Chinese Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee does not adopt public methods to maintain the Shanghai exchange rate and supply foreign exchange for the legitimate needs of various industries. Instead, it authorizes friendly banks to secretly maintain the exchange rate at a natural level. If various industries really need foreign exchange for legitimate reasons, they can purchase it from banks dealing in foreign exchange. However, each bank must review and approve the purchaser to avoid being deceived by speculators and falling into the hands of Japanese merchants. At the same time, adjust the spot and near-term exchange rates to prevent foreign exchange arbitrage. The application for statutory foreign exchange is limited to various free areas. Since Shanghai has a special environment, the Chinese government cannot control all trade. To enhance effectiveness, the above methods are adopted.

Measures for Applying for Statutory Foreign Exchange

Regarding the application for statutory foreign exchange in free areas, it is stipulated that importers who operate on imported goods that are not on the prohibited import list and are necessary for China can apply to purchase them. They should specify the use, name of the goods, quantity, value, port of departure and date, import location, sales location, currency and amount of application. Those approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee will be sold by the China Bank or Bank of Communications at the statutory price. However, the applicant must pay a balance fee equal to the difference between the statutory price and the listed price of the China Bank and Bank of Communications. When the foreign exchange purchase is completed, the applicant should send the special foreign exchange purchase notification to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for cancellation. However, statutory foreign exchange is not allowed to be applied for for luxury and semi-luxury goods.

Chinese Commercial Banks Quietly Await Ministry Orders

The Chinese commercial banks that operate in foreign exchange (excluding the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank) are Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Commercial Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Continental Bank, East Asia Bank, Chung Foo Union Bank, China & South Sea Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, National Goods Bank, Guohua Commercial Bank, Zhongxing Bank, Guangdong Provincial Bank, Ken Ye Bank, Enterprise Bank, etc. Regarding future foreign exchange business, they have already requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance. As soon as they receive the ministry order, they will follow it. Before receiving orders, they will take temporary measures to deal with foreign exchange accounts. It is expected that a formal order will be received within the day. It is also heard that regarding the foreign exchange of various industries and individuals that have been frozen, if they are truly needed for legitimate reasons, such as purchasing necessary goods from abroad and foreign tuition fees, they may submit a request to the Chinese government or the British and American embassies in the UK and the US, requesting them to forward it to the British and American governments for accommodation.

Financial Markets Gradually Stabilize

The Shanghai market yesterday was not like the previous day, under the crashing waves. Instead, it has gradually stabilized. The British HSBC Bank's Black Mountain foreign exchange listing was the same as the previous day. Actual transactions: (1) Spot exchange and July-August futures closed at 3 and a half pence at 15.625; (2) Spot American exchange and July-August futures closed at 5.21875 yuan. British and American foreign exchange rates each increased by 0.0625. The gold market has fallen back. The morning closing was 6,645 yuan, and the afternoon closing was 6,673 yuan. As for the various commodity markets, the prices of various commodities have fallen back. However, the drastic changes in foreign stocks and cotton prices are due to the tightening international situation and the problems of the Jianghai Customs prohibiting exports.

### Scope of Customs Embargo Expanded, Reaching Eleven Types; Goods Already Loaded on Three British Ships Unloaded; Chinese and Foreign Merchants Suffer Major Burden

Under the command of Japanese Deputy Commissioner of Customs Akayama Zuke, the Jianghai Customs in this city, in response to the Japanese government's retaliatory actions against the UK and the US for freezing the funds of Japan and the occupied areas of China, issued a notice from the General Affairs Section by Japanese customs officer Oyamada to prohibit the export of many commodities to foreign countries (excluding Japan) or the free areas of China. Therefore, the import and export trade of British, American, and other friendly nations in this city has suddenly become chaotic and uneasy, and Chinese merchants' businesses will also encounter an unprecedented crisis. Yesterday was the first day after the embargo. The trade market was chaotic. Chinese and foreign people in this city believe that if this continues, major international disputes will inevitably occur. They are all paying close attention to the future.

Embargoed Items Reach Eleven Types

It was previously reported that there were only eight types of goods under customs embargo. However, according to reporters' inquiries yesterday, its scope has been expanded and has reached as many as eleven types. In addition to the machinery, grains, cereals, feed, oils, chemical products, fertilizers, gauze, minerals, and metals reported yesterday, the three newly added types are cotton, medicinal materials, and pigments. The above-mentioned eleven items have been embargoed since the afternoon of the previous day. Various customs brokers who went to request export declarations with the items listed in the notice were rejected for clearance, and the English notice issued by Oyamada was posted on various customs declaration counters. Merchants who witnessed this scene had to swallow their anger and return reluctantly. As a result, exports were stagnant, causing great inconvenience.

Three British Ships Forced to Unload

Since the Jianghai Customs embargo notice was issued, prohibiting embargoed goods from being shipped to Hong Kong and Rangoon, foreign merchant ships have suffered a great blow. Yesterday afternoon, the Hunan and Qiongzhou ships for export had only loaded a small amount of general merchandise for Hong Kong beforehand. Unexpectedly, they were immediately detained and had to completely unload the items. The Hunan ship went to Hong Kong empty, while the Qiongzhou ship went to Siam via Shantou and Hong Kong. Oils, textiles, cotton yarn, hardware, and other items shipped to Siam were loaded and exported as usual. Also, Yisheng Shipping Company's Yuxin ship, scheduled to sail directly from this city to Hong Kong this morning, had all the Hong Kong goods declared beforehand returned and unloaded yesterday. Therefore, it is also scheduled to sail to Hong Kong empty this morning.

Names of Embargoed Items Not Yet Disclosed

It is found that Jianghai Customs prohibits the export of goods including machinery, food, oils, chemicals, grains, feed, fertilizers, cotton, metals, minerals, dyes, and medicines. Yesterday (the 19th) morning, a large number of merchants waited in Jianghai Customs to get the list of goods that the Japanese side prohibited from exporting from Shanghai.

Various Businesses Are Burdened

The immediate impact of the export embargo is not yet known, but business circles believe that this new restriction will impose a major burden on various businesses in Shanghai. It is said that although the situation in Shanghai has been extremely turbulent in recent years, local commerce has been quite prosperous due to the increase in exports and the acquisition of large amounts of foreign exchange. Today, hindered by this embargo, it will naturally feel great difficulty. It is generally expected that the real impact of the embargo will not be felt until more detailed knowledge of the implementation of the embargo is known.

Machinery and Metals Were Restricted Earlier

After the Japanese authorities implemented the ban on the export of metals and other items, it was heard that in the future, export applications would be reviewed by Japanese customs officials in Jianghai Customs. The restriction on machinery and metals did not shock business people, because although Jianghai Customs had not formally banned the export of machinery and metals, some carriers had difficulty applying to Jianghai Customs for the necessary permits to transport these two types of goods for some time.

American Businesses Unaffected

According to responsible American sources here, there are almost no American commercial firms in Shanghai engaged in the export of the above-mentioned goods. Therefore, American businesses here will not be affected by the Japanese ban, and American business circles do not take this as a concern. For the past four years, the Japanese have discriminated against foreign trade in China, including American commerce. The recent move by the Japanese side has little effect on American businesses.

### Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund: Review of Academic Standards - Selection Based on the High or Low Grades of Major Subjects; Examination Method May be Implemented in the Next Issue

Since the beginning of this newspaper's reader scholarship fund campaign, everything has progressed as expected, such as the successful fundraising and the application deadline of only seven days. Soon, a field investigation of the family circumstances of qualified student applicants will be conducted, and it is expected that the matter can be handled by the end of this month.

Yesterday's Donations

Yesterday's donations came from the following individuals: Qu Zhibu Hospital, 60 yuan; Sha Nianhan, 10 yuan; Gu Huilin, little brother, 10 yuan; Gu Peizhen, little sister, 10 yuan; Gao Yunbiao, 5 yuan; Xu Bin, 5 yuan; also from Xu Bin's fundraising: Xu Mei, 4 yuan; Lei Fen, [amount missing] yuan; Lei Feng, 2 yuan; Lei Peng, 2 yuan; Lei Fang, 2 yuan; Lei Hua, 2 yuan; Xu Dao, 1 yuan. The total amount is 115 yuan. With the previous balance of 15,322 yuan and 52 cents, the grand total is 15,437 yuan and 52 cents. (The 20 yuan donation from Yao Ruojuan was omitted in the previous issue but has been included in the total.)

Answering Questions

Yesterday, Mr. Jin Liyi sent a letter to this newspaper, the gist of which can be divided into two points: (1) The scholarship regulations stipulate that the main subjects must have a score of 80, while the average must be 70. This is not very realistic, because students in each school who like science will inevitably be weaker in liberal arts, and vice versa. It is not easy to require all subjects to be good. (2) The grading standards of various schools in Shanghai vary, so 80 cannot be used as the standard. It is hoped that the results can be determined by examination. Mr. Jin's opinion has some merit. However, this newspaper has carefully considered this issue from the beginning and deeply feels that determining qualifications is fraught with various difficulties. The final decision is that a score of 80 in the main subjects and an average of 70 is required to qualify. Elementary schools have six or seven subjects, while middle schools have nearly ten subjects. Therefore, we only focus on a few major subjects, because these major subjects are the basic knowledge for further education, and a score of 80 is necessary to hope for further study. For students above the level of specialized schools, the grades of the major subjects in the major department will be used as the standard. Please pay special attention to this point, Mr. Jin, and do not misunderstand. Those who study science only need to have a score of 80 in the main science subjects to qualify. Even if the grades in other subjects are poor, it does not matter. Other subjects can be inferred by analogy. Regarding the second point, although the regulations of each school are not fixed, they are a minority and will be handled with discretion. Using examinations to determine the results is indeed the best method and may be adopted in the future.

Candy Scholarship

Our newspaper's young reader, Xu Bin, wrote a letter saying, "To the editor of Shen Bao: I read in your newspaper that you are launching a scholarship fund to demonstrate your enthusiasm for education and benefit the poor. I deeply admire you. I am also a student, and my family can afford the cost of education. However, I sympathize with those who are forced to drop out of school due to financial difficulties. I regret that I am unable to provide much assistance. Now that your newspaper has this charitable undertaking, I am donating 5 yuan in legal tender that I saved from transportation expenses, and 15 yuan in legal tender that I raised from my younger siblings, some of whom donated their scholarship money, and some of whom saved from candy money. This small amount is just a token of my support." The compassion of these children is gratifying. I wish them all the best in their future studies and hope that they will work hard to create benefits for the country, society, and humanity.

### The Nitta Maru Did Not Call at Hong Kong; Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from the Philippines; Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) Says It Will Still Sail to the United States

The new postal ship Nitta Maru of the NYK Line's Pacific route arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 29th) from Manila and is scheduled to depart on Thursday at noon, sailing to the United States via various ports in Japan.

Yangtze River Ships to be Requisitioned

The North-China Daily News reports that there have been rumors recently that the Japanese army may requisition Japanese ships sailing on the Yangtze River. Yesterday afternoon (the 28th), Japanese travel agencies on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession did not specify the exact date of departure of Japanese ships from Shanghai, which seems to corroborate the above rumors. Several Japanese ships are scheduled to sail to Hankou before the end of this month. However, the managers of these Japanese ships have told customers who want to buy tickets to inquire again at the end of the month.

### Shanghai Society's Mentality: Permanently in Flux; Excerpts from a Talk by Mrs. Kamaladevi

Mrs. Kamaladevi, a member of the Indian National Congress (see picture), arrived in Shanghai from the United States last week and will soon go to the provisional capital. A reporter visited her residence yesterday with a camera, and Mrs. Kamaladevi told him her impressions of Shanghai after her stay here. The reporter summarized them into several points as follows:

(1) The mentality of Shanghai society seems to have no permanent and stable plan and is always in flux. (2) The policy adopted by capitalist countries in Shanghai is to exploit and oppress, with the sole purpose of seeking their own interests. Once they have gained both fame and fortune, they return to their country fully loaded, and regard Shanghai as worn-out shoes, never thinking about the future development of Shanghai. (3) The salaried class and the laboring class in Shanghai are groaning under the pressure of capitalists, just like the situation in Indian society. The Shanghai Concession authorities only focus on labor-management mediation and part of the work of child protection.

Mrs. Kamaladevi has traveled to various European and American countries and has a deep understanding of the European war. She believes that the future of democratic countries is bright and is optimistic about the future of India after independence.

Before leaving Shanghai, Mrs. Kamaladevi agreed to give a public speech at the invitation of the Chinese-Western Friendship Association organized by international figures in this port. The topic is "New Trends in India" (祖 )

### Foreman of the Public Works Department, Zhu Chengshan, Kidnapped Yesterday; Bandits Intercepted Car at Yanping Road Intersection Early in the Morning; Drove Away After Forcing the Driver Out

A kidnapping case occurred on Yanping Road, Connaught Road, in western Shanghai yesterday morning. The victim was Zhu Chengshan, foreman of the Yanping Road Works Department of the Public Works Department (some say chief engineer). The details are recorded as follows:

Going to Work

Zhu Chengshan, a Ningbo native, 37 years old, lives at No. 6, Lane 299, Seymour Road (Shiyingli). He is a foreman at the Public Works Department and goes to the Yanping Road Works Department every day as usual. The department also sends an official car (No. 15266) to pick him up and drop him off, which is the usual practice. Yesterday morning at 5:30, Zhu had breakfast and got into the car because it had arrived and drove to work.

Suddenly Encountered Kidnappers

Unexpectedly, when the car reached Connaught Road and was about to turn onto Yanping Road, three or four kidnappers suddenly stopped the car and threatened the driver with guns. The bandits then rushed into the car, forced the driver to drive west quickly, and then forced the driver out of the car, and the bandits drove away, kidnapping Zhu without a trace. After watching the car leave, the driver returned to the department to report and notified Zhu's family.

Lost Car Found

After receiving the report from the Public Works Department and Zhu's residence, the police immediately ordered detectives to investigate and notified all police stations to pay attention to the whereabouts of the car. It was not until 11:30 AM that the official car No. 15266 was found near Anhe Temple Road, Rue Cardinal Mercier, in western Shanghai. The department sent someone to drive it back. It was learned that Zhu had received a threatening letter some time ago.

### French Tram Carpenter Shot for the Third Time; Shi Quanfu Shot in the Head; Assailant Fled Without a Trace

Shi Quanfu, a local resident living at No. 792 Rue de Bayle in the French Concession, 32 years old, has been a machine copper craftsman for a long time and is a deputy foreman in the copper workshop of the French tram company.

Unexpectedly, at 6:30 yesterday morning, Shi had just gotten up and was washing his face when another assailant, dressed in white shorts and trousers, broke in while Shi's family was unprepared and fired a shot at Shi's back. The bullet hit Shi's head, and he fell to the ground in pain. When his family heard the noise and rushed over, the assailant, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, fled without a trace. The family reported to the French police station, and they sent detectives to investigate and sent Shi to Kwong Chi Hospital. It is reported that although his injuries are serious, if there are no complications, his life may be saved. The police have ordered detectives to investigate and arrest the fugitive and bring him to justice.

At about 1:00 AM on the 24th of this month, a warehouse of a certain construction plant on Paoshan Road in Zhabei was suddenly visited by a large number of uninvited guests in three trucks.

### Letter

To the Editor of Shen Bao: According to Mr. Li Songshou, the party concerned, he recently read in the news column of the 29th Shen Bao, "Negotiating Film Advertisement to Defraud the Reader's Trial," which is inconsistent with the facts. It is verified that I neither work as an advertisement runner nor am I employed by Yindu Company. This lawsuit is because Yindu Company contracted the slide film of Sanping Theater to me first, and then reneged on the contract. Because I failed to recover the deposit, I used the police station to falsely accuse me of embezzlement. After my defense lawyers Wang Yaotang and Pingheng submitted important evidence to the court and exposed the plaintiff's shady background, the court adopted it and scheduled a continuation trial on the 30th. This is the actual situation of the case. Now I read in the newspaper that "fraud in the name of negotiating for debts... 2,500 yuan" and other sentences are obviously inconsistent with the facts and are related to my reputation. With this in mind, please correct it in your newspaper and publish the original letter as a correction. Sincerely, the Editor of Shen Bao, Lawyer Pingheng, July 29.

The Youth-Affiliated Elementary School Teachers' Mutual Aid Society's summer meeting invited Huang Jingwan, a social improvement practitioner, to speak on the goals of the economic lives of elementary school teachers in the time of national crisis.

Except for the marriage of yourself or your children, do not issue invitations. The invitations issued are limited to close relatives and friends. The wedding and funeral ceremonies should be as simple as possible. No gifts are given during the holidays; (F) Advocate proper entertainment. At any time, you should not enter dance halls to play cards, and abstain as a principle. Limit yourself to one or two movies per month. After work, enter a proper group, read books and newspapers, play music, practice calligraphy and painting, play chess, listen to lectures, watch exhibitions, visit good teachers and helpful friends, visit and learn production skills, visit parks, and stroll on the streets. People who have not yet become independent should also follow the economic life, be self-reliant, and organize a customs improvement association. I hope that people from all walks of life will save useful money to run people's livelihood and welfare undertakings, so as to help poor teachers with loans or scholarships for outstanding youth. I hope that colleagues in elementary education will stand up and put it into practice.

Academic Lectures

### The Memory Method for Reading (I)
— Hu Deling

If we only have perception and cannot remember, we cannot form a conscious life. Because of this, we cannot help but accumulate old experiences from perception to promote the generation and formation of new experiences. Moreover, the notions caused by perception always come from past experiences. With that kind of notion, perception has meaning. Learning and memory are clearly two aspects of the same thing. Learning is change and promotion, and memory is preservation. Because there is preservation, there is change and promotion. As for reading, everyone knows the necessity of memory.

1.  Stages of Memory

Now, let's discuss the relationship between memory and reading as follows: The stages of memory can be divided into four points: (1) impression, (2) grasping, (3) recollection, and (4) recognition.

(1) Impression: Whenever something from the outside world is received and forms a kind of sensory knot, this sensory knot is called an impression. This impression must have good qualities when it is absorbed in order to help memory with good influences. When reading, it is best to pay attention to concentration; otherwise, after reading, no impression will be gained in the brain.

(2) Grasping: Once the impression has been absorbed, it should be preserved and not forgotten. This is what is called grasping. If the impression comes but is not grasped, the impression will be lost as soon as it arrives and cannot be preserved at all.

(3) Recollection: All things or materials that have been impressed and preserved are sometimes recalled because of current needs. This is what is called recollection.

(4) Recognition: When something or material that has already been impressed and preserved is sometimes recalled, a kind of emotion occurs. The occurrence of this emotion is the emotion of recognition.

2.  Conditions of Memory

Memory is based on the habits of the nervous system. The nervous system's response to certain things becomes a habit, and then it can be remembered. According to physiological relationships, memory must have the following four conditions:

(1) Memory is proportional to new and old concepts. Newly acquired concepts are easily regenerated, and the regenerated impressions are also clear. As for old concepts, it depends on the length of time. The longer the distance of the acquired concepts, the more difficult the regeneration; the closer the distance, the easier the regeneration.

(2) Memory is proportional to the decisiveness of learning. The more decisive the learning, the easier the memory; otherwise, memory is more difficult.

(3) Memory is proportional to the strength of attention. Strong learners also have strong memories; otherwise, weak attention leads to weak memory.

(4) Memory is proportional to the intelligence of the aptitude. Generally speaking, those with clever aptitude have strong memory, while those with dull aptitude often have poor memory.

### Finance: The United Kingdom and the United States Do Not Want to Be Too Hasty; Free Entry and Exit in the Black Exchange Market

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC's listed exchange rates were all flat. The dark market for British and American currencies turned back towards relaxation, due to sales by Banque de l'Indochine and American banks, as Chinese speculators emerged to cover their short positions too eagerly. The market relaxed from the opening in the morning. Bank of England and HSBC offered less supply, and although they re-entered the market later, speculators had already turned to selling. Although the amount of settlements made by importers was huge, Banque de l'Indochine and Chase Bank sold. The US dollar hardened from 5.15625 yuan to 5.25 yuan for settlement. Russia then returned to selling at the indicated price. In the afternoon, there were fewer speculators selling. Later, there were rumors that the Four Banks were withdrawing, and the trend softened as import foreign firms bought to settle. In the end, both exchange rates relaxed. There was a large volume of transactions, and there were very few new purchases and sales by speculators. According to reason and logic, after the foreign exchange freeze, there should be considerable restrictions on transactions. However, in retrospect, the market situation is just the opposite. Is the situation really as reported by the London telecommunications on the 29th? Yesterday's indications here are that the democracies' commercial and financial restrictions on Japan may be implemented leniently. The main purpose of the actions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands was originally to use intimidation against Japan, fearing that being too hasty would force Japan into war and that the property of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East would be the first to suffer. Therefore, they still do not abandon their appeasement policy, resulting in the current strange phenomenon of freezing foreign exchange without settling. Furthermore, there is no date for the promulgation of concrete measures.

Speculators Are Still Trading

From the morning, the foreign books for the British, American, and Indian silver markets were all flat. The exchange rate of each country against Shanghai rebounded by 1.1 yuan for the US dollar (actually, it rebounded by 0.1 yuan; the previous day's telegram was a mistake of 5 yuan instead of 4 yuan). The exchange rate of the pound against Shanghai was slightly 0.15625 yuan. The central government's listed exchange rates were not changed. The internal market opened with banks selling prices, the spot British exchange rate was 3 pence 125, the long was 0.3125, and the US dollar was also long 0.3125, at 5.1875 yuan. Chinese merchants came to buy August US dollars at 5.15625 yuan, reportedly supplied by HSBC. Later, the trend turned hard again. HSBC's listed exchange rates were still changed. The silver balance tax was still levied at 24.25%. It was heard that the HSBC small counter US exchange rate was 5.125 yuan, and people's minds were more stable. Chinese merchants turned to sell at 5.1875 yuan. HSBC and importers all bought in, while Chinese and American banks sold out. Speculators and Chinese banks resold August US dollars to Mai Jiali and others at 5.25 yuan. The loosest price could be settled at the indicated price, but by noon, the US dollar was 5.21875 yuan, and the British pound had hardened to 3 pence 15625.

Importers Continue to Settle

At noon, speculative transactions became sparse, and there was little buying of August at 5.25 yuan. It was heard that importers were still continuously settling. There were rumors of bullish news from Japan, and gold prices rebounded. Therefore, at the evening closing, the situation was quite tight. At 3:30 PM closing, the spot to August British pound was 3 pence 140625, and the US dollar was 5.1875 yuan. Compared with the previous day's closing, the British was long 0.046875, and the US was long 0.03125.

Hong Kong US Dollar Spot Rate Relaxes

### Gold Market Winds Gradually Subside; Spot Price Retreats Below 8,000 Yuan

The gold market was fluctuating yesterday, but the fluctuations seemed to have turned smaller. However, the market situation is still unstable. Under the shroud of rumors, people's minds turned from fatigue to stability, and after the price gradually fell, it rebounded slightly. It once collapsed, falling below 6,600 yuan. It was rumored that Hong Kong was blockaded, and the tense relations between the US and Japan increased, and the US dollar relaxed to 5.25 yuan. Therefore, both the gold number and securities groups sold heavily, and the price gradually retreated from 6,730 yuan to a low of 6,590 yuan. There was also a certain bullish rumor in this city, and the price rebounded by 50 to 60 yuan before the noon closing. After opening in the afternoon, the market was flat and fatigued. Soon, it was heard that a Japanese merchant ship was released, which might ease the situation. Furthermore, there was a rumor that banks would stop doing foreign exchange today, which aroused the gold and securities groups to re-enter the market, and the price was raised close to 6,700 yuan. However, it was suppressed by a certain money house selling, and the price finally decreased by 27 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 50,000 taels. The swap (July to August) seller posted 70 yuan to the buyer. The cash had reversed and retreated to below 8,000 yuan. In the morning, Shun Yuan offered 20 taels at a price of 8,000 yuan, Tian Yuan offered 50 taels at 8,050 yuan, Wan Feng offered 50 taels at 7,980 yuan, and De Fu offered 20 taels at 7,950 yuan.

Cheng Ji, Tong Kang, Yong, Da Feng, and Yi Yuan came to buy, and the price jumped by 70 yuan, raising it to 6,730 yuan. It was heard that the US dollar could be settled at 5.1875 yuan, and Yi Da, Shun Yuan, Xiang Xing, and Yong Li sold, gradually decreasing to 6,680 yuan. Ming Feng, Xin Feng, and the silver number group supplemented, hovering around 6,700 yuan for a long time. Until after 10:30 AM, the foreign exchange continued to relax, people's minds were more vacant, and Yi Da poured out. He Sheng, Cheng Da, Qi Feng, and Ding Sheng started to sell, and the price gradually decreased by 120 yuan, falling to 6,590 yuan. Yi Da re-entered, and Xin Feng Yong also bought. In the bullish rumors, the price rebounded to 6,650 yuan. The noon closing was 6,645 yuan. The afternoon opened at 2:00 PM at 6,640 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower. He Sheng, Shun Yuan, and Yi Li sold, and the price immediately decreased by 30 yuan, shrinking to 6,610 yuan. Soon, in the bullish rumors, Yi Da, Tian Yuan, Tong Kang Yong, He Sheng, and others called up and absorbed, and retail investors re-entered, and the price gradually rose by 85 yuan, reaching 6,695 yuan, and Da Feng and Yi Li sold out. At closing it showed a retreat to 6,660 yuan, Lian Xing and Tong Kang Yong entered another ten yuan or so.

### Yarn and Cloth: If the Southern Route Is Blocked, Shuangma Yarn Will Fall Into Difficulty; A Drop of 200 Yuan in Two Days

The yarn market continued to decline, and the decline was still fierce. This was because after the Customs' Japanese Customs Affairs Department announced the regulations prohibiting the export of yarn, cloth, and cotton, the market was greatly shocked, and people were panicked. Because Shuangma yarn only relies on the inland route, general speculators treat it as a standard. If there is a little bit of manipulation, the usual price will be higher than other yarns. Besides the fact that the price of Tiannv yarn is 200 yuan more expensive, once a change breaks out, the reaction is faster and the decline is more drastic. Therefore, if this route is blocked, it will collapse. As for general households holding spot goods, in view of the fact that this yarn is prohibited from being exported, they uniformly sell out in the futures market and the spot Shuangma factory order to protect themselves and temporarily avoid risks. The yarn market was greatly hit. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,545 yuan, and the low price was 1,455 yuan. In the afternoon, people were extremely anxious. At first, it was made at 1,435 yuan to 40 yuan. Gradually, it plummeted to 1,405 yuan. After 3 o'clock, there were rumors of refined bullish news, and at the same time, profit-makers offset it, and the market returned to close at 1,480 yuan. However, the current yarn market, because of the terrible drop of 260 yuan in the past two days, of course, there is a possibility of a rebound.

Shuangma opened in the morning, and the situation was quite vacant. Everyone in the market was shouting to sell, but they were calling for a lower price to enter. The first transaction price was 1,525 yuan. Shortly after, it fell to 10 yuan, and buyers flocked in. In a moment, it rebounded to 1,545 yuan. However, the customer business was completely suspended. In the next 30 to 40 yuan, unexpectedly after 11:30, due to a large number of spot merchants selling out, the market price was unable to support it and plummeted. In an instant, it relaxed to 1,455 yuan. Afterwards, profit-makers slightly offset it, and it returned to close at 1,460 yuan. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day totaled 9,020 bales, including 9,000 bales purchased by the same industry and 20 bales taken by the Hong Kong gang.

The morning market situation of Jin Shuangma futures yarn, due to environmental bearishness and rampant rumors, the long positions in August were very smooth to sell, plummeting 60 yuan, the price was 1,405 yuan. It was auctioned to 9's empty households for offsetting, slightly rising by 15 yuan, the price was 1,540 yuan. October also fell by 5 yuan, the price was 1,510 yuan. After opening, new purchases and short covering increased slightly. August was as high as 1,438 yuan, September was flat, and October was 1,523 yuan. After entering, the spot yarn fell, Hong Kong sales stopped, and the selling trend was heavy again. August fell to 1,316 yuan, September was 1,445 yuan, and October was 1,436 yuan. The prices of each month all fell to the extent of the limit down, and the long parties must pay the margin and guarantee money. The 3rd market in August and September was suspended, and the October period rebounded by 19 yuan to close. The noon closing for August and September each fell by 79 yuan, and October fell by 60 yuan. After the market opened at two markets, due to the continuous relaxation of people's minds, the market price was not auctioned. By the time of the third market, it was widely rumored that the Four Banks were withdrawing, and the buying sentiment was revived. The market price opened higher and higher. August rebounded by 22 yuan compared to the noon closing, September by 36 yuan, and October by 30 yuan. The evening closing result was that the August period still fell by 57 yuan compared to the previous day, September fell by 43 yuan, and October fell by 30 yuan. The biggest difference in each month was 95 for September, the total transaction volume for the day was 43,550 bales, an increase of 6,640 bales compared to the previous day, and the daily opening and closing high and low prices were recorded on the left (the net market bid price).

The futures yarn market will be closed today for delivery.

### Sudden Change in the Yarn Market; Cotton Merchants Are Short of Breath

The current cotton situation, everyone unanimously looked bullish in the past, because foreign cotton stepped up and followed it upwards, unexpectedly the yarn market suddenly changed, the falling wind was already terrible, and the sales were prohibited, the factory will inevitably have the danger of suspending work, so the raw materials are discarded and no one asks. The market price has plummeted because of this. The transaction in yesterday's market was only one transaction by the number family, 100 pieces of Brazilian cotton, the stack delivery price was 503 yuan, about 2 yuan lower than the previous day.

In another message, the Shanghai foreign cotton foreign firms set the price easily. Since the United States announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds and will implement an embargo, the Pacific Ocean suddenly became uneasy. After that, whether American cotton will come to Shanghai or not, and whether Shanghai can continue to trade as usual under the situation that Japan will implement retaliatory freezing, are all major problems that need to be solved at present. At the same time, because the Customs officially announced that the export of yarn and cloth items is not allowed, the current yarn market immediately turned sharply downward and fell into a slump. Because of this, cotton merchants intend to get Lishan, and the market feels tired. In the past two days, the non-special direct purchasers did not dare to try, and no one inquired about the procurement of spot goods.

The New York cotton market is unstable and there are differences. At first, it rose due to purchases by the Southern gang and New Orleans, and then it fell due to the international situation being not optimistic and the long parties taking profits. As a result, the closing price was 2-3 points higher or lower than the previous day.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Pours Out; East Piece Goods Rise and Fall Suddenly

The factory cloth market rebounded and fell yesterday, because the embargo on yarn and cloth caused panic, and floating shorts came out and sold. The selling price also gradually decreased. However, in the afternoon, there were rumors of bullish news, and cloth prices rebounded. As a result, white goods still fell by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece. There were few transactions in bleached and dyed cloth. The total transaction volume of various cloths in this street was more than 300 pieces, and the Yin Jin gang in the northern road transacted more than 200 pieces of line, wool, and velvet cloths. The South China business is temporarily suspended. Also, today there are 36 pieces of cotton cloth shipped to Singapore.

The Dong cloth exchange's futures cloth market first fell and then rebounded. As a result, it fell by 0.3 to 0.8 yuan per piece compared to the previous day's closing price, and the spot market was also manipulated by speculative hoarders, rising and falling suddenly, and the changes were unpredictable. White fine cloth and fine twill generally had no glory or disgrace. The late closing price of the Longtou fine cloth factory order was still 50.09 yuan. The highest price of the four gentlemen's wool fabrics was 1.6425 yuan, the lowest price was 1.57 yuan, and the closing transaction was 1.635 yuan, a decrease of 0.0625 yuan per yard.

### Grains: There Is Plenty of Rice in Storage, Speculation Does Not Stop, and the Price Is Unstable

Yesterday, the early market for foreign rice had a very strong falling wind, especially for the spot foreign rice small roll. The stock in the market was originally full, and the source had not yet been blocked. Once the exchange rate rises, it can continue to be set. Also, it was heard that the Public Works Bureau had a new transaction agreement for 5,000 tons. In addition, rumors unfavorable to the buyers were very prevalent. Therefore, both retail and wholesale had poured out. It was also heard that if the rice price continued to be manipulated, the warehouses would be sealed. Those who made a profit wanted to get rid of it urgently. Therefore, the opening price of the spot small roll was 1 yuan lower, at 124 yuan. Still 123 yuan down to 120 yuan, a difference of 5 to 6 yuan from the previous day. But before long, there was a saying that it was beneficial to the buyers, and the market gradually rebounded to a high of 123.5 yuan. Once the market price was low, the speculative gangs would absorb it when it was low. In addition, there were various rumors, sometimes bullish, sometimes bearish. The people's food and rice have long been shrouded in a speculative atmosphere. The market price should be up and down, and the speculative ball gangs and manipulators really only fear that the market is too peaceful and the situation is too stable, and they cannot fulfill their wishes. Now, at a time when international events are changing several times a day, they should consider it a unique opportunity to have a good time. In fact, the total amount of rice stored in Shanghai, including the cargo on the way, has reached 3 million dan. Although there is little Du Geng, it can always help. In terms of people's food, there is no need to worry for a year and a half. However, the market finally rebounded by 2 to 34 yuan. As a result, the spot rice still pulled small yuan, while the futures and the current Yinghua Department rose and fell each other. A No. 1 spot Chen package opened to 150 yuan, broken rice was 107.5 to 108.5 yuan, No. 2 Siam rice was 145 yuan, futures was 142 yuan, small roll futures was 19 yuan, spot rice was 149 yuan starting at 150 yuan, 1512 to 153 yuan. When the spot was initially , No. 1 Saigon once had a cry of 1367 yuan and a small roll of 127 yuan. Then, for the above reasons, it repeatedly returned to small. The floating garden retail households did not die, and they started to buy again. The closing price of No. 1 Saigon was 1312 yuan, No. 2 was 1234 yuan, Min Dang ordinary goods was 128 yuan, 126 yuan, Suci was Nian 2 yuan, Jia Fo rice was Nian 9 yuan, 127 yuan, small roll was 1234 yuan, and Tokyo broken was 111 yuan, broken tip was 96 yuan to 94 yuan.

The market for thick and thin japonica rice, domestic rice, and foreign countries was deserted, but the prices were sufficient, and the foreign rice returned to flat, people's minds turned tired, and the sales market was not good. The opening price was similar to the previous one. The selling price of fresh early and late rice from Nanhang was 154 yuan to 151 yuan, Wuxi Yuan had white japonica rice at 142 yuan to 138 yuan, Hong Kong white yuan was 126 yuan to 123 yuan, glutinous tea was 16 yuan to 13 yuan, and Jin 30 domestic glutinous rice was 1278 yuan.

### Flour Is Tense; The Air Dissipates

Yesterday's spot foreign flour market situation re-entered a fatigued state. After the financial upheaval aroused the rising wind, there was suddenly news of a ban on re-export. The tense air suddenly dissipated. With the reduction in actual sales and the release of hoarders, the market turned downstream sharply. The whole market made the opening price of Jinlong flour 33 yuan to 32.9 jiao, and the closing price was only 32.75 jiao. The opening price of Pao Tai flour was 33.9 jiao to 8 jiao, and the closing price was 23.7 jiao. The opening price of Huawu brand Australian flour Taikoo Stack was 33.8 jiao, and the total transaction volume of Shuangying, Wuyan, and other flours was 14,500 bales, a decrease of 7 to 8 jiao compared to the previous day.

Yesterday's wheat transaction was still rarely developed. There were about 200 to 300 bales of new wheat from the mainland, all of which were designated for delivery to Japanese factories. The purchase price was still about 41 yuan, and the purchase price of Chinese factories was 47 yuan, but there were no spot goods to be collected. The market was still in a stable state.

### Securities: A Sense of Selling Overwhelms the Stock Market

The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday was unusually erratic, fluctuating sharply, with rises and falls measured in dollars and cents. This volatility reflects the uncertainty of the people. Class C bonds rose from 69.20 yuan to 70.05 yuan before retreating slightly to 69.20 yuan, closing at 69.95 yuan. The frequency of these fluctuations and the frenzy of trading ultimately favored the sellers, creating an extremely chaotic market situation. Yesterday, due to short covering, demand exceeded supply. Heng Kang, Run De, Yi Ji, and Gong Mao were all buyers. Lian Yi, Lian He, Yi Tai, and Ren Chang all sold off. Ju Feng and Tong Yu also sold significantly. By the midday close, the market had risen from small gains to larger ones, increasing by almost one yuan compared to the previous day, and exceeding the lowest price by 1.30 yuan. In the afternoon, the primary buyers were Yi Ji, Ren Feng, and Chang Gong Mao. Other firms, such as Xin Fu, entered into Class A and Class E bonds while exiting Class C. Tong Xing and Tong Kang made slight adjustments. However, the surge of sellers was overwhelming, regardless of the consequences. Le Mao alone sold approximately 800,000 yuan worth, and Lian Yi sold 600,000 yuan. Yi Qin, Da Tong, Xinhua Bank, and De Long also released substantial amounts. Furthermore, Jiu Feng, Hong Da, Da Feng, and smaller retail investors selling spot goods were also significant contributors. After the market opened, prices gradually declined, breaking the 70-yuan mark again and revisiting the low of 69.20 yuan. Prices rose and fell sharply, experiencing significant volatility. Were it not for the short covering, the market would have plummeted. Ultimately, the market reversed from gains to losses. Only Class B bonds saw a slight increase of 0.25 yuan due to the substantial drop the previous day, and Class D bonds rose slightly by 0.10 yuan as there were no afternoon transactions. All other bonds retreated by 0.05 to 0.55 yuan, except for Class C bonds, which only fell by 0.05 yuan. Total trading volume for the day exceeded 4.4 million yuan. A concise table is provided below:

Stock Trading: Fifty shares of the Shanghai Cotton Exchange were traded at a price of 52.50 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### Specializing in Referral Fees

— Cao Ming

"May I ask, where can I find housing?"
Nian Yang points remotely to ×× Village.

Just as I was thinking of heading back for dinner, I suddenly spotted a flyer on a utility pole (at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Medhurst Road). It read: "Housing - Referral Service, - Liu, ×× Village, ×× Number."

"I can't miss this opportunity!" I thought, and headed towards ×× Village.

There were already two women, who looked like wives, requesting referrals. After they left, the person approached me: "About where do you want to be near?" "Near Jing'an Temple," I replied. "Will you introduce me to several good places then?" Without waiting for my answer, he pulled out a fountain pen, tore off a sheet from a notepad, scribbled for a while, handed it to me, and followed with: "Each referral costs 1.20 yuan."

As a result, he gave me four referrals, for which I paid him four yuan.

However, I was again disappointed. The first household wasn't renting, and the second only leased office space.

As I arrived at the third place, my watch pointed to "2," my stomach was growling, and I thought to myself: "The third place is upstairs at ×× Hall in Jing'an Temple; it's better to have a meal before going upstairs to see the house."

While I was eating, a middle-aged woman walked in, and as soon as she entered, she asked: "Is there any housing available for rent here?" Immediately, a voice came from the counter: "What kind of use are you putting it to?" "Residential," she said. "Residential is not for rent."

"Residential is not for rent?" In unison, the middle-aged woman and I felt as though we had had a bucket of cold water dumped on our heads.

After a moment, a young man in a suit came in: "Excuse me, where can I inquire about renting a place?" "What kind of use are you putting it to?" "For office space," he said. "Not for rent, we only rent to residential."

This made me curious; what was going on?

After finishing my meal, I asked the waiter: "Is there any housing for rent upstairs?" Before the waiter could answer, the voice from the counter chimed in: "What kind of use are you putting it to?" From the initial conversation between the two people looking for housing, I gained experience, so I countered: "What are you planning to rent it out for?" He scrutinized me with sharp eyes. I was dressed politely and carrying a briefcase. (Inside were newspapers and the rental slips the tea room had given me.) He slyly said: "We only rent to residential, nothing else." "Then please accompany me upstairs to take a look," I said.

He seemed a bit disappointed, because he assumed I was looking to rent office space. But he had no choice, so he accepted the referral slip and accompanied me upstairs.

The room was as small as it could be, with a window facing the street. Because the restaurant kitchen was downstairs, the room was full of smoke, and even the ceiling was black. In one corner were four or five bedding rolls, said to be for the old steward to sleep on. He told me the monthly rent was 250 yuan.

Although I knew their game, I figured the money was already in their hands, so what was there to say? Therefore, I had to leave all the way down – directly down the stairs, running through the partition walls.

Alas! Their income is quite good! If thirty people are fooled by one house in a day, then the referral fees alone would be a thousand yuan a month. Moreover, they can still have someone sleep there at night. There is nothing strange in Shanghai.

### Oscillating Fan

A self-proclaimed clever person said: "It's most difficult to be a 'modern' person. To be able to navigate the 'left' and also please the 'right' is truly a difficult thing. However, based on my 'experience,' it's best to imitate an oscillating fan, pleasing both the east and 'delighting' the west, achieving 'universal happiness,' so to speak."

He put down his erhu, trying his best to suppress the joy in his heart, and said very solemnly, "However, if we singers want to earn big money, a small part depends on talent, but a large part depends on diligent study. If you really want to learn from me, you must practice for at least two years, and only then can you ask for 18,000 from others."

Two years. Although Mei Bao felt it was too long, the words "18,000" had entered her bloodstream like an anesthetic, causing her to nod her head repeatedly without realizing it.

She thought about how hard her father had worked in recent years, not eating enough, not dressing warmly. When had she seen him smile? These past few months of illness, the money for the doctor, the money for medicine, and the money to hire two workers to help Xiao Gouzi in the fields, all of it came out of the old leather trunk under her bed. Every time Mei Bao took out a banknote, she clearly saw the muscles on her father's face twitching. Without asking, she knew how painful it was for him! Later, during the days when his illness was severe and he was unconscious, he kept mumbling, "One thousand gone," "Five hundred gone," "Less than three hundred left"… This series of painful delirium.

"Even if I only earn 1,800 a month after learning to act in two years, that will still be hundreds of times more comfortable than now!" She lowered her head, fiddling with the corner of her clothes as she thought this.

"But there's one thing I must tell you first:" Shang Lao Er constantly rubbed his ten fingers, which were yellowed by opium smoke, and said with a very gentle smile on his face. "The rules of learning opera are a bit different from those in your school. When you are learning, I don't want any money from you, but after you have learned the opera and go on stage, this old man's remaining years will depend entirely on you! Child, think about whether you are willing or not?" (171)

### Husband's Assets

— By Gu

Liabilities

Clothing, Food, Rent, Transportation, Cosmetics, Entertainment Expenses, Social Expenses, Other

Current Assets: Cash, Bank Deposits and Interest, Accounts Receivable; Fixed Assets: Wives and Concubines, Children, Real Estate, Equipment, Furniture, Other

In divorce cases, it is usually the woman who initiates them, while men rarely do. Firstly, because they would need to pay a large amount of alimony; if they don't love their wives, they can seek pleasure outside without divorcing. Secondly, because husbands can treat their wives as private property; if one isn't right, they can acquire another one, the more the better. If you don't believe it, please see the table above. However, this example only refers to the leisure class; bachelors are excluded.

### A Review of School Life Over the Past Year

— Ye Xingnian

In the unique environment of Shanghai, schools, which are merely filling vacancies for profit, are crammed onto the isolated island, hanging up the banner of sanctity, while actually engaging in transactions. Many students do not cherish their rare opportunities for education and valuable youth, nor do they think about the earnest expectations that the nation and society place on them.

A year ago, I blindly entered such a school and began to see the darkness inside. In the classrooms, filled with everything, there were sounds of debauchery, shamelessness, laughter, and scolding. There was not a moment of quiet. Even when the teacher was shouting loudly to explain, they had the power to turn a deaf ear. Therefore, the relationship between teachers and students gradually became like ice and charcoal, impossible to melt. The most unbearable thing was that this was performed every day.

The students were too indulgent, too free, arbitrarily changing seats during class, endlessly talking loudly, and constantly humming Peking opera tunes. As a result, teachers resorted to beating and scolding as the only good method of instruction. In the past, corporal punishment was the exclusive right of teachers, but now, in this method of instruction, pushed to the extreme of emotion, it was simply a dance of fists and feet, with yelling filling the room.

It is unnecessary to discuss whether this kind of beating and scolding conforms to the principles of education. In the end, everyone goes their own way. No improvement has been seen, and the opposition between teachers and students has left even deeper cracks.

Schools are supposed to be havens of education, and "patient and skillful guidance" is also an established method of education. "Not convinced by heart" is also a warning from the sages. Teachers and students should have their own feelings, so why should they face each other with weapons like labor and management? The world is going downhill, and it's hard to stop sighing.

We should know that the foundation of nation-building is in schools. Those that aim for money and value form over substance, and cannot make education conform to the times, will not exist in the current great era. These young people who lack the spirit of self-study and self-governance need reasonable supervision and guidance. We must seek close connections in sincere communication, becoming one. In that case, what is there to fear in a solid union, which cannot produce an invincible, great power! (Moved to help those in need)

### Loss of Blood

— Wu Qing

Shanghai's bedbugs are truly ubiquitous, with traces of them in tall foreign houses and attics. It's just a matter of how many! Let's take my home as an example to calculate our blood loss:

Each of us probably supports fifty bedbugs of all sizes, each consuming half a cc per night. Shanghai has a population of five million, and if more than half of them are infested, then the consumption every night is 1.25 million cc of precious blood. What an alarming number! I don't know how many wounded soldiers and patients could be saved with that blood!

Bao Sen and Hui Zhu Collaborate on Visiting Mother

Yang Bao Sen was originally a second-tier veteran singer who came south several times with Zhang Eyun, Song Dezhu, and others. He was very popular with opera enthusiasts who considered him a rare talent among veteran singers. After returning north, he was encouraged by friends to form his own troupe, collaborating with Xu Xiu Sha and others. Recently, Bao Sen performed "Si Lang Visits His Mother" at the Sanqing Theater. The collaborator was Yan Jupeng's daughter, Yan Hui Zhu. The two were billed together, and the advertisements on the theater posters were very bizarre. Under Yang's name was written "Visiting Mother and Returning the Order," while under Yan's name was written "Princess Iron Mirror." This was probably a special condition for Yang and Yan's collaboration. Recently, I heard that Bao Sen will meet Shanghai audiences at the Golden Theater in the guise of a top-billed performer. If this comes to pass, it may cause quite a stir.

Shao Shan and Ju Peng Collaborate on Entering the Palace

"Entering the Palace Twice" is a labor-intensive opera requiring the collaboration of veteran, dan (female), and jing (painted-face) performers. The entire opera is sung non-stop from beginning to end. If any of the three performers is weak, it will be greatly diminished. Therefore, this excellent opera used to be listed as a cold, unpopular piece. A few years ago, Tan Fuying, Zhang Junqiu, Wang Quankui, and others staged this opera at the Golden Theater, and it became a hit. "Entering the Palace Twice" was transformed from a cold piece into a popular one. People like Yan Jupeng and Zheng Bingru also used this opera to promote their performances in Shanghai. However, due to imperfect matching, the performances have not been completely satisfactory. The role of Xu Yanzhao has been particularly difficult to cast. Recently, I heard that there will be a special performance with the cast of Jin Shao Shan as Xu Yanzhao, Yan Jupeng as Yang Bo, and Nan Tiesheng as Li Yanfei. Shao Shan's "Entering the Palace Twice" has been recorded, and his powerful voice is indeed the most ideal for playing Xu Yanzhao. Yan Jupeng is known for his singing skills, and his "Entering the Palace Twice" includes unique verses such as "Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter." Except for his slightly narrow voice and occasional strange tones, he can also be said to be the typical actor for playing Yang Bo. As for Nan Tiesheng, he previously gave a short performance at the Golden Theater, and his singing was beautiful, earning the praise of connoisseurs. With the collaboration of these three, the excellence of the performance is naturally expected. It's a pity that this good opera cannot be brought to Shanghai to perform; otherwise, it would definitely be a sensation. In addition to this public performance of the main opera, there will be a cross-dressed comic piece, "Double Yao Hui." The cast list is very funny: Jin Shao Shan plays the First Wife, Yan Jupeng and Xiao Changhua play the two Neighbors, Hou Xirui plays the Second Wife, and Nan Tiesheng plays the Husband.

### Guo Chunyang's First Performance

— Luyuan Scholar

Guo Chunyang's public performance was originally scheduled for the Carlton, but due to supporting roles, it was changed to the Golden Theater. This is the time for a hero to put his skills to use and a good man to show his skills. However, Chunyang has never performed in Shanghai before (except for a performance of "Dingjun Mountain" during his teacher's sixtieth birthday celebration, which was an exception). Opera enthusiasts do not know his skills. Now, I will briefly introduce two or three of the features of the various operas he has performed that are unique to him or cannot be performed by other actors, so that people can see the whole picture.

(1) "Beating the Stick and Leaving the Box": This is a purely Tan-style masterpiece. Chunyang was able to perform this opera at the age of ten. After more than ten years of training, it has become even more refined. This opera is divided into four acts: "Questioning the Woodcutter," "Making a Scene at the Mansion," "Beating the Stick," and "Leaving the Box." The singing, recitation, and acting are all extremely demanding. His dialogue with the woodcutter and his body language in the recitation are unique. The singing in "Making a Scene at the Mansion," the expressions in "Beating the Stick," and the "Iron Bridge" in "Leaving the Box," as well as the hair-flipping when seeing the constables, cannot be done by someone who has not worked hard and has deep roots.

(2) "The Banquet of the Ministers": This opera is known to the world for its singing, recitation, and acting, and the drumming is the most difficult part of this opera. But the most difficult part is not the "Late at Night" section, but the three drum rolls. The dots, wrists, and skills must be evenly matched, and the weights, speeds, highs, and lows must be well-organized without any bias or heaviness. The generosity, intensity, tragedy, and desolation directly move the listeners and amaze the audience. Drumming skills like this are enough to overwhelm everything. If you don't believe me, please verify it another day.

(3) "Celebrating the Pearl": This opera was performed by Mei Lanfang in the United States and was very popular with people there. It is a social drama with a very good plot and profound meaning. According to Chinese old principles: what is called the inequality of wealth and the bullying of good people by evil gentry, according to today's world trend: is what is called class struggle, the disparity between labor and capital, one squeezing and the other resisting. The Americans watched this opera and criticized and praised this opera with this perspective. Chunyang's performance is in line with this purpose. The excellence of the singing and acting goes without saying. He has a special skill in the fight scene with the teacher, the "flying kick", which is unmatched by other actors. In addition, there are popular plays such as "Dingjun Mountain," "Empty City Stratagem," "Catching and Releasing," "Visiting the Mother," "Battle of Taiping," and "Fa Men Temple," all of which have unique features and are his proud works. They are must-see plays, so I will not list them all. Please wait and see.

Chapter Thirteen: Refusing to Bow One's Head in the Wilderness

Xu Jing thought to himself, "This beast has openly come to harass people. Either way, it's just a wolf, and no matter how fierce it is, I think I can handle it with this sword in my hand. But if this beast damages my mount, that would be a great pity." So he mustered his courage, opened the door, and rushed out with his sword. The wolf saw someone walking out of the door, as if it had found its target, opened its greedy mouth, and raised its sharp claws, pouncing towards Xu Jing's head. Xu Jing shouted, "Beast, stop your rampage, take my sword!" and thrust the Crimson Phoenix Sword into the wolf's belly. The wolf saw the sword light and quickly turned its body away, and then pounced again, pouncing at his feet. Xu Jing swept the sword downwards, and the sword's edge struck the wolf's paw. Although the wolf was injured, its courage did not diminish, and it bit at Xu Jing. Xu Jing wielded the sword quickly, and wrestled with the giant wolf. Man and wolf lunged and attacked each other for more than a dozen rounds. Xu Jing watched for an opening and used the Rhinoceros Dividing Water stance, thrusting the sword in, and it pierced into the giant wolf's abdomen. The wolf cried miserably and fell to the ground. Xu Jing drew out his sword and added another strike to the wolf's head. The wolf died stiffly in a pool of blood. Xu Jing took a breath, dragged the wolf up, threaded it with rope, and tied it to a large tree, waiting for Liu Yining to return, so that he could report his merits to him. Just after he tied it, he suddenly heard a howl from the opposite cliff. He looked up and saw two wolves running towards him. Xu Jing thought to himself, "I and the dead wolf fought to the point of being somewhat exhausted, and now there are these two wolves coming. If I am careless, my life would be worth less than nothing. But if I were to close the door, and Liu Yining returned home and saw it, wouldn't he laugh at me for being timid and useless?" So he picked up many small stones from the ground, hid them in his bag, and climbed up a large tree in front of the door. Just as he settled down, the two wolves had already rushed to the foot of the tree. They saw the dead wolf and looked at Xu Jing in the tree. They also knew that their companion had been killed by this person, so they all shouted and jumped at Xu Jing, vowing to get him. (128)

### A Record of an Airborne Musical Performance

— Leidianhua

The Shanghai music scene, which had been dormant for a long time this year, has become active on the isolated island filled with lifelessness. The Chinese Vocational School Harmonica Team, the Guoguang Harmonica Team, the Public Harmonica Society, the Shanghai United Harmonica Team, the Postal Workers' Union Harmonica Team, the Municipal Council Harmonica Team, the Chinese Amateur Music Society, the Shanghai Sacred Music Troupe, the Yafeng Chinese Orchestra... more than ten musical organizations jointly held a public celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the "China New Musical Instrument Changji Manufacturing Company" at Xinhua Radio Station the day before yesterday (27th) in an "Airborne Music Conference."

That afternoon, various vehicles sped to the central Hongmiao on Nanjing Road. There were obviously more people getting out of the cars than usual. Among those "happy" men and women, most of them were there to participate in this meaningful "Airborne Music Concert" and to admire the true faces of the musicians.

The broadcasting studio was filled with chairs, neatly arranged in rows, with different seats indicating the different parts played by the performers, so that they could cooperate and stick to their posts. All programs, including the Guoguang Team, Postal Workers' Team, United Team harmonica ensemble, the Public Team accordion ensemble, the Yafeng Society Chinese Orchestra ensemble, and the Pipa solo, were the most popular and praised.

### Brief News

### Small Biographies of Pear Garden Figures

(Twenty-Six) Chen Shaolin

Chen Shaolin is the son of Qingyi (female role) master Chen Delin. He attended school as a child and never devoted himself to learning opera. It was not until Chen Delin passed away and for the sake of the family that he began to devote himself to it. Shaolin's sister married Yu Shuyan, and because of this relationship, she taught him very forcefully, stricter than a professional teacher. Even for a slight mistake, she would whip him without mercy, not even sparing him when important guests were present. Because of this, Shaolin was always afraid when he saw Yu Shuyan, trembling lest he not meet his expectations. With such reservations, his comprehension gradually disappeared. The fact that Shaolin received Yu Shuyan's earnest guidance but could not grasp all of Yu Shuyan's beauty was due to Yu Shuyan's poor teaching, and it was not entirely because the student was not diligent. However, Shaolin has already gained much. In recent times, among the rising veteran singers, although there seem to be many, in terms of strictly adhering to the rules and not daring to act arbitrarily outside the established guidelines, after Yu Shuyan, there is only one Yang Baosen, and after Baosen, only Shaolin. This is what I can say with certainty and without doubt. It is a pity that his voice is slightly hoarse and his talent is not the best. In the future, if he works hard and deepens his skills, he may be able to make up for this shortcoming through artificial means.

(Editor's Note) From the twenty-fifth article of this magazine, Mr. Zheng Guoyi has been hired to write the articles. Mr. Zheng Guoyi has a wealth of knowledge of drama and explains the history of the opera world as if recounting family treasures. Use a few words to introduce him.
