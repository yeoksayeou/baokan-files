### Japanese Troops in Southern Henan Stage General Retreat; Remnants Southeast of Wuyang Cleared; Southwest of Bo County Two Strongholds Successively Recaptured by Chinese; Japanese Troops Invading Guangdong Blocked Between Danshui and Huizhou

Chongqing – Military News: (1) Various units of the Chinese army in southern Henan are pursuing the defeated Japanese troops. The Chinese forces fiercely pursued the enemy along the Pinghan Railway front towards Suiping, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers in fierce fighting until the morning of the 5th. The remaining Japanese troops are retreating south. Southwest of the Pinghan Railway, in the southeastern area of Wuyang, the remnants of the Japanese forces encircled and annihilated by the Chinese have been almost completely wiped out. Japanese troops retreating from Nongfeng were severely defeated at Zhao Yin Town and Jishang, suffering heavy casualties. Japanese troops retreating southwest from Wuyang were also surrounded and fiercely attacked by the Chinese. In fierce fighting until the morning of the 6th, the Japanese left behind over four thousand corpses and broke through to flee. Chinese troops are still continuing their pursuit. (2) One night, Chinese forces attacked Japanese strongholds at Wulongkou and other places across from Yichang. The Japanese responded with heavy artillery fire. The Chinese troops bravely charged, breaking through multiple points in the Japanese barbed wire defenses, killing many Japanese soldiers. (3) Japanese troops in Jiangxi advanced towards the Fujiang area on the morning of the 5th. After engaging with the Chinese army, fierce fighting continued until noon.

Hong Kong – After the Japanese army occupied Danshui and Shayu Chong, land transportation between Hong Kong and Shaoguan was completely cut off. Several Japanese transport ships arrived at Dapeng Bay yesterday, reportedly preparing to attack Huizhou. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is currently only between Danshui and Huizhou. The situation on the Hong Kong border remains normal, with no influx of refugees. According to reports from Chongqing, the Chinese authorities have not yet announced details of the Japanese landing in Dapeng Bay and the government does not pay much attention to the Japanese attempt to cut off transportation between Hong Kong and mainland China, or regards it as unimportant. Some goods have been smuggled across the Japanese naval blockade from Shayu Chong into mainland China, but these goods are all transported by private merchants and the quantity is relatively small, so the Japanese occupation of Shayu Chong has no serious impact on the import of important overseas goods into mainland China. (Reuters report of the 6th)

Luoyang – Chinese troops in eastern Henan have recaptured the Shizi River southwest of Bo County and the San Guan Temple south of Bo County. (Report of the 6th)

Hong Kong – Japanese troops who landed at Ao Tou in Daya Bay near Shenzhen and invaded Danshui suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Chinese army. (Report of the 6th)

Hong Kong – After the Japanese forces occupied Shayu Chong yesterday morning, ferry services between the town and British territory have now been suspended. The Chinese army had anticipated Japanese action and withdrew in advance, so there was little fighting in Shayu Chong. The Japanese forces included three thousand soldiers, an aircraft carrier, a cruiser, and three destroyers. (Reuters report of the 6th)

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesperson told reporters today that after two weeks of fierce fighting in Henan province, the Japanese army has suffered over 20,000 casualties. At the beginning of this week, two routes of the Japanese army advanced north from their bases established last week. Among them, 6,000 men advanced along the railway line from Queshan and arrived at Sui Ban on the 31st, engaging in battle with the Chinese army. After suffering about 5,000 casualties, the Japanese troops moved west and arrived at Wuyang on the same day. The second route of Japanese troops departed from Bao’an on January 29th and engaged in battle with the Chinese army at Xianghe Pass, lasting for five days. The Japanese army suffered over 9,000 casualties. The Japanese army moved northwest and captured Fangcheng on February 3rd. The Chinese army moved south from the north. The Japanese army then moved south, and this Japanese force has now reached the southeast of Nanyang. At the same time, between these two major routes of the Japanese army, there are also several small Japanese raiding units engaging in harassment. The Japanese divisions involved in this operation were drawn from northern Hunan and western Hubei, so the strength of the Japanese army in China has not increased. The area of operations covers 200 kilometers. The Japanese army used its mechanized units. In Guangdong province, the fighting continues as the Japanese army attempts to cut off the supply route between Hong Kong and Shaoguan. (Reuters report of the 6th)

Chongqing – According to reliable war reports received here recently, the battles in various areas since the end of last month are as follows: In Henan Province, Chinese and Japanese armies are fighting fiercely in the area between Wuyang and Da Nian Yuan, southwest of the city. This area is where the main force of the Japanese army is located, and the Chinese army is also constantly reinforcing its forces, so the development of the situation deserves great attention. The activities of the Japanese army in western Anhui and the Kaifeng area have suffered major blows from the Chinese army. The Japanese army advancing north from Jingmen and Dangyang in Hubei province has been frustrated in Yuan’an, northern Hubei, and is retreating to its original positions. The Japanese army units operating between Jiangsu and Zhejiang aim to open up the Beijing-Hangzhou Road. After weeks of fierce fighting, the Chinese army has restored its influence in Changxing and Yixing. It has achieved great victories in several battles at Lanshanzui and Jiapu Town. Currently, dozens of important strongholds west and southwest of Taihu Lake have been recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese side suffered heavy casualties. (Havas report of the 5th)

### Soong Tzu-wen's Conversation with American Reporters: During the Period of Resistance and Reconstruction, China Will Be United Against Foreign Enemies; Only Chiang Can Lead the National War Effort

New York – Soong Tzu-wen, the head of the Bank of China, told Maurer, a reporter from the Chicago News Agency, that the unfortunate friction between General Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party would not lead to civil war as generally expected in the United States. The New York newspaper, which obtained the above news of the interview from the Chicago News Agency, reported that Soong said that this friction would not lead to open civil war during the continuation of the anti-Japanese war, that is, before China achieved victory. Soong has been in the United States for several months and is an unofficial representative specially appointed by the government afterwards. The Chinese Embassy in Washington announced today that Soong is currently suffering from a cold, but the illness is not serious. Soong said in the above interview that there is a possibility of friction between Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party. He pointed out that before the Sino-Japanese War, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party fought each other for ten years. It is said that Soong said, "After we defeat Japan, the Chinese Communist Party may become the radical faction in a free government." Soong also said that he does not believe that there are more than 250,000 Communist troops now, or 10% or 20% of the total number of Chinese troops. Soong said that this number is actually too much. Maurer asked Soong why Chiang continued to accept Soviet supplies after this friction occurred. Soong replied that Moscow recognized that most of the Chinese fighting forces were under Chiang's control, and only Chiang could lead the national war effort. Soong also pointed out that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party supported Chiang. (United Press report of the 6th)

Editorial

### US Presidential Representative Currie Arrives in Chongqing

According to news from Hong Kong last night, Currie, the representative sent to China by US President Roosevelt, arrived in Hong Kong from Manila the day before yesterday, and left Hong Kong for Chongqing yesterday. As of the time the reporter is writing, there has been no further report, but based on the expected itinerary, he should have arrived safely in Chongqing. Currie is the Deputy Director of the US President's Office (?), and a statistical expert who studies economic realities. It is said that his main tasks in coming to China are: first, to deliver the President's private letter to Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in person; and second, to investigate China's economic realities. Some say that the United States is planning to provide China with a huge loan, and Currie's investigation report will be used as a reference for the decision. However, this rumor has been clearly denied by the Chinese and American authorities.

We welcome Currie to China and to Chongqing. We are ashamed that we cannot make any substantial contribution in terms of figures to Currie. However, the Chongqing authorities have indicated that after Currie arrives in Chongqing, they will be open and honest about everything he needs to investigate and know, and will provide him with the greatest convenience. Therefore, the object of Currie's mission will surely obtain what he needs and there is no need for us to elaborate on it. What we wish to elaborate on is beyond substantial figures.

We do not believe that the rumored tasks of Currie's visit to China are the entirety of his true mission. We also do not want to delve into what Currie's true mission actually is, but we hope that Currie will pay attention to: Firstly, the clear and resolute policy of the United States towards the Far East and China is well known to us. However, we would like to supplement the American government and the public with the explanation that when the United States decides to implement all its measures under its policy, at least at present, it must get rid of its habitual commercial attitude and change its routine commercial methods. We admit that the so-called "commercial" is the most practical, reliable, and enduring standard, which is not only suitable for the normal norms and ideals of the United States, but also what China, which respects faith, is willing to study. However, the so-called extraordinary period now is not only because China has encountered aggression, which makes it extraordinary, but also because the entire international community and the future of the world are in an unprecedented extraordinary period. Because of its extraordinary nature, the United States should take a broad and long-term view and take it as the standard for deciding everything. Change when you are poor, and change will lead to success. It is not appropriate to be confined to habitual and normal norms and ideals. Secondly, today's China is in the stage after starting the War of Resistance and going through forty-three months. Many important cities have been captured, a wide area of fertile land has been occupied, and most of the coastal and river areas have been blockaded. During this period and under these circumstances, it is absolutely impossible to judge superficially. Only the Chinese who know themselves and have confidence, as well as experts with true knowledge and foresight, can understand how strong the potential power that China possesses is, and that it can be used as a basis for continuing the long-term War of Resistance. Therefore, we hope that Currie's investigation will pay attention to tracing back from the present to the past, and even more predicting the future from the present, so that he can clearly understand what a magnificent and rich civilization group and a living group this great country with a history of five thousand years is. Thirdly, China's politics, economy, society, and everything else, measured by modern standards, are indeed not as good as they should be. Therefore, if everything is measured by Western and scientific standards, it is often difficult to know the real situation in China. We do not know how we can help Currie understand everything in China, but we might as well point out a general outline to help understand China. In short, China, from society and business to the army and politics, is full of innate factors of flesh and blood compatriots. It may be assumed that this is a kinship-based, family-based nation. Looking at the unemployment problem in peacetime and the refugee problem in wartime, the actual situation, no matter how difficult and arduous, is very different from what Europeans and Americans and European and American countries imagine. This one point should be used to deduce and consider other issues. If one must take figures as the standard and statistics as the standard, then not only will there be various disappointments, but there will also be various unnecessary pessimism and disappointment. Fourthly, we do not need to repeat the process of diplomatic relations between China and the United States in history. As for the present: China is one of the belligerent countries, and the United States is one of the neutral countries. The positions seem to be completely different. However, from the obedience of democratic governance, the safety and interests of the Pacific Ocean's future, the belief in human civilization and international treaties, and the desire to resist aggression, China and the United States are completely standing in the same camp and completely heading towards the same destination. This is well known to President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, Currie, and the general public of the United States. What we still want to say is that China regards resistance and construction, both now and in the future, as two sides of the efforts made by the Chinese nation, and they are by no means two different things. The United States is now seeking to know about China, and must regard China's resistance and construction, both now and in the future, that is, assisting in combat and developing resources and markets, as the same thing and plan for it as a whole. In this way, we can obtain a greater and more accurate concept.

The above four points are sincerely hoped to be paid attention to by Currie, and what the reporter said is superfluous nonsense.

### US House Ends Debate, Lend-Lease Act to Be Voted on Soon; Bill to Build 200 Cargo Ships Passed; Halifax Meets Hull for Lengthy Talks

Washington – Last night, the House of Representatives ended the general debate on the Lend-Lease Act, so that consideration of amendments can be implemented today. The House of Representatives meeting last night lasted until 1:50 pm, and the eloquent speeches finally ended. The total number of members who spoke in the three-day debate reached 111, and the number of speakers yesterday was as high as 64. House leaders have considered whether to accept amendments from the opposition in order to win over those who oppose the bill and obtain a unanimous vote. Democratic members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee also discussed some suggestions with Rayburn, a Democratic member of Congress from Texas and the majority leader in the House of Representatives, but no decision was made. Rayburn said that the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Administration may accept amendments that restrict the President's right to conclude treaties, do not use US warships for navigation, and set a limit on the expenses of this procedure. The most colorful debate last night was the fierce attack by Democratic member of Congress Marcantonio from New York on Britain and British Ambassador to the United States Halifax, who said that the current war is a battle between two gangs of imperialist thieves, one of which has already engaged in theft yesterday, and the other is attempting theft today. He also condemned Halifax, saying that he is an imperialist who betrayed the Spanish people, betrayed democratic countries, and sold out democratic countries in Munich. The House of Representatives is scheduled to consider amendments today or tomorrow, and the vote on the bill is scheduled to be implemented tomorrow or Saturday. (United Press report of the 6th)

Washington – House leaders yesterday considered accepting some amendments to the Lend-Lease Act proposed by the opposition in order to make the final vote a representation of national unity behind President Roosevelt's foreign policy. During the debate yesterday, Minnesota Republican member of Congress Knute Nelson, who voted against the war in 1917, said that the United States is now prepared to repeat the previous stupid things. Massachusetts Democratic member of Congress McCormack, who supports the bill, said that this bill is a "peace plan." Those who are "true warmongers" are those who oppose this bill. These people are ignorant and try to divide the American people. It must be known that such divisive means today will eventually lead to destruction. "Think about what Germany and the military-controlled Japan will impose on the United States once the Axis powers win!" (United Press report of the 6th)

Washington – Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee yesterday opposed the government's raising of the national debt limit from US$49,000,000,000 to US$65,000,000,000 (an increase of US$16,000,000,000), calling it unnecessary and dangerous, and advocating raising it to US$60,000,000,000. The House of Representatives is scheduled to discuss this bill immediately after the debate on the President's Lend-Lease Act is completed. (United Press report of the 6th)

Washington – The House of Representatives yesterday accepted the Senate's amendment to the bill to build 200 cargo ships, so this bill has been sent to the White House for signature and implementation. President Roosevelt recently requested Congress to allocate US$313,000,000 for the construction of 200 cargo ships. (Reuters report of the 6th)

Washington – British Ambassador Lord Halifax met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday to discuss general issues between the two countries. The meeting lasted one hour before it ended. Hull told people that the British and American discussion on lifting the food blockade in the conquered areas is now waiting for strong evidence that can prove the extreme need for food in the area, but there has been no discussion of Britain lifting this blockade. (United Press report of the 6th)

Washington – The US Treasury Department yesterday notified the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the list of assets in the United States given by the British government indicated that the British government would soon be able to obtain US dollars to pay for war supplies. There are three large business companies run by the British, namely Lever Brothers, American Viscose Corporation, and Dunlop Tire Company, as well as other smaller private companies. The US Treasury Department's release of this information is to refute what General Wood said on Tuesday that he did not believe that the British assets list included all kinds of interests owned by the British in the United States. (Reuters report of the 6th)

### American Military Supplies to Be Shipped to Britain via Iceland; Officials Are Discussing This Plan to Solve the Serious Problem of British Military Supplies

Washington – Latin American diplomats recently told reporters that American officials and diplomatic circles are discussing a plan to use Iceland as a transshipment base for American military supplies to Britain. The plan is to allow American ships to transport military supplies to Iceland, because according to the interpretation of the American Neutrality Act, Iceland is a neutral country and is not within the war zone. American military supplies to Britain may be unloaded in Reykjavik and then loaded onto British ships and shipped to Britain. It is reported that this plan is under study by the Executive Department. It is generally believed that British military supplies are often lost due to German submarine attacks. This plan is a practical way to solve the serious problem of British military supplies. The main benefit of this plan is that it can reduce the distance required for British cargo ships and escorts to transport military supplies by two-thirds. As for American ships, they are currently not allowed to enter British territorial waters. The diplomat who reported this plan to the reporter was very supportive of it, saying that this method can increase the number of voyages for Britain to engage in this transportation from one to three times, and it can also allow Britain to transfer two-thirds of the warships currently serving as escorts in the Atlantic to other places for use, or it can make the escort work more intensive. The sea route from New York to Liverpool is 3,700 miles, while the route from Iceland to Liverpool is only 1,000 miles. The diplomat also pointed out that this plan can be implemented without amending the Neutrality Act, because since Denmark surrendered to Germany, Iceland has generally been recognized as an independent country and is therefore not affected by the Neutrality Act. Since Germany occupied Denmark, the United States has had practical interests in Iceland and has established a consulate in Reykjavik. Although American officials have not yet recognized this plan, Latin American diplomats said that the United States has recognized it as one of the possible means of helping Britain. The route between New York and Reykjavik is sometimes quite dangerous due to icebergs, but the United States has experienced patrolling teams that can warn ships to avoid danger in advance when they find a large amount of ice in the sea.

### Willkie's Return to America via Portugal: Message to Germans Upon Leaving England, Opposing Aggression and Dictatorship

Lisbon: Republican leader Wendell Willkie arrived here yesterday from London. He told reporters, "I have obtained the information I desired and am extremely satisfied." Willkie departed for New York on the "Dixie Clipper" at midnight. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

London: Willkie's visit to England has now concluded. In a message left for the German people, he stated, "I am a descendant of Germans. Our family name was originally Willeke, not Willkie. My ancestors left Germany ninety years ago because they were Protestant Christians who opposed autocratic politics and demanded the right to live freely. Today, I also demand this right. I am proud of my German blood, but I hate aggression and tyranny. Please tell the German people, the vast majority of my fellow German descendants share my beliefs. They also believe in freedom and human rights. Please tell the German people that we, German Americans, deeply mourn and condemn the current German government's acts of aggression and power-grabbing." (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

London: President Roosevelt's personal representative, Harry Hopkins, visited British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday, believed to be a formal farewell. He is scheduled to return to the United States within days. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

### U.S. Navy Secretary Announces: 100 Fighter Planes Shipped to China for Combat Use; Chinese Government Originally Planned to Purchase 500

Washington: Navy Secretary Colonel Knox announced that China has purchased one hundred American fighter planes. It is understood that China originally planned to purchase five hundred. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Washington: Arrangements are currently being made here to supply China with one hundred military aircraft custom-made in England for the Xiangfu (likely a misspelling of 向甫, Xiàng Fǔ, referring to H. H. Kung) delegation, but these planes have not yet been delivered. The Chinese government had requested five hundred planes. After final negotiations, the British have agreed to deliver the first one hundred planes completed to China, and the later ones to Central (likely referring to the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company). Navy Secretary Knox also announced that the U.S. Navy Department has agreed to provide Greece with thirty Grumman fighter planes without charge, but the Greek ambassador has declined, saying that Greece needs newer models. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Washington: Although U.S. Navy Secretary Knox announced yesterday that China was prepared to purchase one hundred planes from the U.S. Navy, the Navy Department stated that it was unaware of this purchase. The Chinese Purchasing Commission here also denied this news, but sources here said that China had long hoped to purchase five hundred American planes. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

### Japan's Ambition to Invade the South is Obvious

Tokyo: Hoshino, Director-General of the Planning Board and Minister without Portfolio, explained the purpose of the new national economic structure to the House of Representatives Committee today, stating that Japan's economic lifeline is in the South. The proposed co-prosperity sphere cannot be achieved unless it includes the eastern part of the South China Sea region. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Italian Forces in Africa Rapidly Retreating: British Forces Advancing Towards Benghazi; Attack on Keren Also Very Successful

Cairo: The British offensive in various parts of Africa is progressing smoothly. A British communique announced today that the British forces in Libya are continuing to advance towards Benghazi. British forces on the Eritrean front are closing in on the Italian positions at Keren. Italian forces retreating from Barentu are now under pressure from British forces in the Duri area. To date, British forces have captured over 1,800 prisoners, mostly Italians, and countless military supplies. On the Abyssinian front, British forces are making good progress along the Gondar Road. The British forces have penetrated deeply into the areas of Italian Somaliland invaded by British forces. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Cairo: In the past thirty-six hours, the rate of retreat of Italian forces in Libya, Eritrea, and Abyssinia has greatly increased. They are using all roads to retreat towards the rear. Italian forces retreating towards Benghazi are moving twenty to thirty miles per day, suffering heavy casualties from concentrated British air raids. Following the Italian forces in their chaotic retreat are hundreds of Italians who settled in the area three years ago. British forces are following and pursuing them on two parallel roads from Cyrenaica to Benghazi, encountering very little resistance, as the countryside between the British front lines and Benghazi has no defensive positions. The British forces are mainly targeting Barce (the eastern terminus of the Benghazi railway) for the future. Although Apollonia, near Cyrenaica, was not mentioned in the British communique, Italian forces are believed to have abandoned the area. Italian forces in Eritrea, fleeing southeast towards Barentu, are in a state of collapse, abandoning various military supplies in their eagerness to reach the highway between Asmara and Addis Ababa. In Abyssinia, British forces are pursuing a column of Italian forces retreating towards Dahr, north of Lake Tana. Although the Italian forces are employing delaying tactics, the British forces are continuing to advance. Another British force, pursuing Italian forces retreating towards the Red Sea south of the Eritrean railway, has so far captured 1,500 enemy soldiers, mostly whites. The enemy forces have abandoned a large amount of materials. After swiftly occupying Barentu last week, mechanized British forces from Sudan are continuing to pursue the Italian forces. British forces near the Abyssinian border have seized a large number of Italian mechanized transport vehicles, some in perfect condition. British forces are also maintaining contact with patriotic Abyssinian forces in the railway area in northwestern Abyssinia. The enemy has planted landmines along the ninety-mile highway leading to Gedaref in Sudan, but the British mobile forces in the area are still making satisfactory progress. A British command communique stated that, to date, 400 Italian soldiers who have become separated from their units have been captured. British forces in the Eritrean region are currently engaged in military operations to attack Keren, which are proving quite successful. British forces from South Africa, who have entered southern Abyssinia, are currently consolidating their captured positions. British patrols in Italian Somaliland are continuing to operate in various areas, including an attack on an enemy outpost forty-five miles inside the border of that area. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Nairobi: A communique last night stated that a large patrol of British African troops had captured the Italian-fortified Beers Geogani sentinel post within the border of Italian Somaliland and is in pursuit. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

British Air Force Assists in Operations

Cairo: British Air Force bombers repeatedly attacked Barce, Dukabania, and the Italian lines of communication to Benghazi within Libya on Sunday. Italian motor transport units between Maraua and Barce were also heavily bombed, causing severe damage. The Barce railway station was attacked, with three bombs hitting the tracks, and the hangar at the Berka airfield was also hit. Benina was bombed and caught fire. A British Air Force communique from the Middle East stated that British fighters shot down two Italian planes and destroyed one enemy seaplane and one bomber. Furthermore, a squadron of South African Air Force fighters assisted the army in its offensive in Eritrea, attacking enemy airfields and setting five Italian planes on fire with their bombs. The squadron also engaged enemy aircraft in the Asmara area, shooting down one enemy plane. At least one enemy plane was also destroyed on the ground. British planes also attacked several military targets and motor transport units in Eritrea. The British planes suffered no losses. The South African Air Force continued to assist the army in operations in southern Abyssinia, with one fighter alone shooting down three Italian planes. On Tuesday, enemy planes attacked Malta and were intercepted by British fighters. At least three Italian planes were shot down and several were severely damaged. Houses suffered minor damage. All the British planes that went into action, except for one bomber and one fighter, returned safely. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Cairo: On Tuesday evening, planes from the British Air Force Middle East Command heavily bombed the Maliza airfield in the Italian Dodecanese Islands, with several bombs hitting the airfield and starting large fires. Furthermore, British air forces assisted the offensive of British forces on all five fronts in Africa. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Italy Sends Envoy to Negotiate with Britain: Evacuation of Nationals from East Africa; Meeting Place to be in a Neutral Country

London: The Daily Telegraph reported that, because Italy's Abyssinian empire is being invaded by Britain and internally threatened by patriotic elements, Mussolini sent Count Volpi, his former Finance Minister, last night to negotiate with Britain the evacuation of approximately 100,000 Italian immigrants. This is the first clear indication that Rome recognizes the situation in Italian East Africa is completely hopeless. According to a visitor from a neutral country in Vichy who relayed news from New York, reliable sources claim that Count Volpi arrived here last weekend to negotiate the evacuation of Italians who have immigrated to Abyssinia since 1935. The Spanish ambassador to Vichy, Li Guili Jia (likely a transcription error from Spanish diplomat José Lequerica Erquiza, 李奎里加), is said to have been introduced by the Vichy authorities to act as a mediator for the Italian government. As a result of Count Volpi's mission, the French government has requested the French manager of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway Bureau between Addis Ababa and Djibouti to resume traffic on the line, which has been suspended since Italy entered the war last June. All rails destroyed by British air raids will be repaired as quickly as possible. Mr. Volpi had lunch with a high-ranking French official last Saturday, and it is believed that they discussed the issue of using the railway to evacuate Italian refugees. Mr. Volpi's talent for negotiating economic and political matters is generally recognized, and it is now believed that his negotiations with Britain will take place in a neutral country, either Spain or Portugal.

### Smallest Nation in Europe Celebrates Independence Anniversary

San Marino: San Marino, the oldest and smallest republic in Europe, celebrated its 201st anniversary of independence yesterday. This republic, located in the heart of the Italian peninsula and covering only thirty-eight square miles, was founded in the fourth century by a stonemason named Marinus, during the persecution of Christians by Emperor Diocletian. Napoleon I recognized its independence when he conquered Italy. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

### British Fleet Sails into the Mediterranean Again: Undertaking Important Mission

London: A special correspondent from a warship in the central Mediterranean British fleet reported that the powerful British Eastern Mediterranean Fleet, unafraid of the new threat from the sky, has sailed into the sea again, determined to eliminate German and Italian planes. The enemy's aerial challenge has failed to hinder the British fleet. Several British ships have undertaken important missions in the central Mediterranean, while light fleets are continuously assisting in the fighting along the Libyan coast. The British fleet has been underway for four days and is well within enemy aircraft range, but no enemy planes have yet appeared. One enemy reconnaissance plane was sighted some days ago, and it is believed that the plane must have reported the British fleet's location, so all members of the fleet are on alert for battle. However, the lack of enemy aircraft sightings is somewhat disappointing but increases the British confidence in controlling the Mediterranean. The British fleet has been sailing for several days without incident, encountering only a few mines, which were avoided by changing course. British fighter planes are soaring freely in the sky. The British fleet will soon return to base for a brief rest. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Germany Is Rushing to Build Aircraft: Attempt to Invade England

Washington: Government sources revealed yesterday that Germany is using the material and human resources of the countries it has conquered to accelerate the construction of submarines, warships, and new fighter planes in an attempt to invade England. Officials stated that Germany's failure to increase arms production indicates that its armaments are already sufficient, but it lacks a full complement of the latest first-line aircraft. As for its increased submarine production, it is attempting to cut off Britain's lifeline, namely, Britain's maritime transport. (International News Service dispatch, 6th)

Italian forces launched two counterattacks on the coast, both of which were repulsed. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

### After Darlan's Return to Vichy, Franco-German Relations Have Not Been Fully Resolved; Hitler Aims to Utilize the French Fleet; French Cabinet Holds Meeting to Discuss Response

London: According to the Independent French Press Agency, receiving news from the French border, Hitler has notified Vichy that the Franco-German problem must be fully and fundamentally resolved and implemented within this month. It is said that the Vichy government is still trying to delay, giving no clear answer, but this decision by the German side seems to be a letter of ultimatum. Regarding the French cabinet meeting, nothing was heard yesterday. The Toulon radio station only stated that the cabinet meeting was "very important." According to Swiss radio, informed sources in Vichy said that Naval Minister Darlan may return to Paris this morning. While the Vichy cabinet was meeting to hear Darlan's report, the German side was exerting pressure by broadcasting from the Stuttgart radio station. A German broadcaster from the station, speaking in French, expressed pessimism about the chances of promoting understanding between Vichy and Berlin. It was claimed, "If the current situation remains unchanged or worsens, Germany will have to take precautions." The implication is that the German side may impose the harshest conditions on France. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Berlin: The German official news agency stated that a communique issued after the French cabinet meeting yesterday stated that the French cabinet met for two hours yesterday under the chairmanship of General Petain. Admiral Darlan reported on his talks in Paris in recent days. Cabinet members then considered general policies. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

London: According to Lyon radio, Vichy Naval Minister Darlan reported on his talks in Paris at a cabinet meeting convened by General Petain yesterday afternoon. The cabinet meeting is still in progress. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Washington: According to information received by well-informed diplomatic sources here, Laval lost his position in the Petain cabinet last December because he agreed with the German side to allow them to use the French fleet and occupy the port of Bizerte in Tunis, French Africa. Now that Laval has been reinstated, Berlin will demand the fulfillment of this agreement, but General Petain is unwilling to agree. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Vichy: Naval Minister Admiral Darlan, after conducting negotiations with the German authorities in Paris, returned here yesterday and immediately reported to Marshal Petain on the course of the trip. Marshal Petain then convened a State Council at 4:30 PM today to discuss it, lasting for two hours. What kind of developments will occur in the negotiations between the French and German authorities will depend on the outcome of this meeting. Admiral Darlan will likely carry new instructions and make another trip to Paris. According to responsible sources here, new developments may occur in the situation, and they will be dealt with accordingly. As for rumors of an imminent cabinet reshuffle, they should not be easily believed. What can be said at the moment is that after the meeting between Marshal Petain and former cabinet member Laval, the misunderstandings between the two sides for a month have been happily resolved in the spirit of unity and are bound to produce significant results. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Berlin: The organ of the German authorities in Alsace, the "Strasbourg News," commented critically on French domestic politics today, stating, "Since France signed the armistice agreement, Franco-German relations have been normal, but only as a transitional period, that is, only until Laval was dismissed in mid-December of last year. [Laval] was the first French politician to recognize that Franco-German cooperation was a new path for France. Paris believes that Vichy's current policy will be of no benefit to France. Vichy has gradually returned to its old policies, and its attitude is confused, which will inevitably result in the loss of the opportunity to cooperate with its eastern neighbor. France's wait-and-see policy will cause France greater losses than war. Germany does not want to interfere in the domestic politics of other countries, but Laval's expulsion has affected Franco-German relations." (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)

Vichy: Last night, while the French cabinet was meeting, hundreds of reporters from various countries waited in the corridors of the Parc Hotel for the cabinet's resolution. According to well-informed sources, Laval did not put forward conditions, but only made suggestions. It is expected that when Naval Minister Darlan goes to Paris again, Laval's suggestions will be brought up for discussion again. What is being discussed here is whether Laval's power when he returns to Vichy will be greater than before December 12th. What kind of results will Vichy's response to Paris produce? (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)

Vichy: The French State Council met yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, with General Petain presiding. Key government officials all participated. It is believed that Naval Minister Admiral Darlan has reported on his meetings with German Ambassador to France Abetz and former French Foreign Minister Laval. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th) Vichy, according to well-informed sources,

French Naval Minister Admiral Darlan, after reporting to General Petain on the negotiations in Paris, may travel to Paris again today. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)

Berlin: A German official spokesperson stated to foreign reporters yesterday that he was not at liberty to comment on the rumors of a relaxation of tensions between General Petain and Laval. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)

Vichy: French Naval Minister Darlan left Vichy this morning at 10:00 AM for Paris and will return here on the 8th. Therefore, all important political issues will be decided after his return here. Political figures here are paying close attention to the fact that U.S. Ambassador Leahy repeatedly visited General Petain while Darlan was preparing to go to Paris. In recent days, the U.S. ambassador has been very active. It is rumored that Leahy's purpose in visiting General Petain was to inquire about the instructions that Darlan was taking to Paris. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)

Vichy: French political figures generally believe that General Petain will decide on France's policy within a week, or he may decide as soon as Darlan returns to Vichy from Paris. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)

### German Ambassador Arrives in Sofia: Further Demands Made; Joining the Axis to Allow Passage to Attack Greece; Soviet Attitude Deserves Attention

London: According to reliable sources received here yesterday, Colonel Tragonaev, the Bulgarian ambassador to Berlin, has arrived in Sofia, carrying a renewed German invitation for Bulgaria to join the Axis alliance. Well-informed circles say that Bulgaria may accept it, after which Germany will invade Greece through Bulgaria. Authoritative sources believe that Germany will use the stationing of Royal Air Force squadrons in Salonika as a pretext for action against Greece. It is highly doubtful whether the Soviet Union will take action if Germany openly invades Bulgaria. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Sofia: The Bulgarian King met with the outgoing Minister of Agriculture, Bagrianov, yesterday. Rumors are circulating that the King will appoint Bagrianov to form a new cabinet, but this has not been confirmed. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)

Istanbul: After the Soviet official news agency denied the rumors that the Soviet-Turkish mixed (likely referring to a joint Soviet-Turkish) and Turkish arms purchasing delegation had arrived in the Soviet Union, it broke the silence. This calm state has been seen by the Turkish side as a sign of disagreement between Germany and the Soviet Union regarding Balkan policies. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)

Sofia: The Bulgarian Parliament passed a resolution yesterday, with a majority vote, supporting the policy adopted by the government, after listening to Prime Minister Filov's statement regarding the resignation of the Minister of Agriculture. Many deputies made speeches. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)

London: A diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle stated that Germany's diplomatic and military preparations for invading Bulgaria are now actively underway and show signs of occurring at any moment. If German troops enter Bulgaria, Britain will have another active ally, because Turkey has made it clear that such action will not be tolerated. London naturally hopes that Bulgaria will resist Germany's attempts to enslave the country, but the basis for this hope is not very solid. With Romania and Greece as examples, Bulgaria will be able to choose its own destiny. The correspondent also stated that, no matter which path Bulgaria chooses, it is almost certain that its territory will become a battlefield, or perhaps the place where the outcome of the war is decided. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Czechs Hide Food Supplies: Resisting Germany

London: According to news received here, the German agricultural manager in Prague reported to Berlin that there was large-scale sabotage of food supplies in the Czech Republic. He stated that 250,000 pigs and many cattle and sheep were secretly slaughtered by civilians last year. At least 300,000 tons of meat were not transported to Germany, and 13,000 carloads of grain were hidden. An order to search houses for food has not yet been issued, for fear that civilians will panic and destroy even more food privately. New disciplinary measures have now been issued to prevent sabotage, with the lightest punishment being a fine and six months in prison. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Amidst Flying Snow, British Aircraft Attack the French Coast: Calais and Boulogne Bombed

London: The Air Ministry announced that although enemy aircraft activity was slight off the eastern and southeastern coasts of Britain yesterday, very few enemy planes penetrated inland. Bombs fell in one area in northeastern Scotland and one location in Kent, but there was no damage or casualties. Yesterday morning, British fighter planes shot down an enemy bomber. Last night, sirens sounded again in London, followed by heavy artillery fire. It was reported that a batch of incendiary bombs was dropped in a certain district of London, mostly landing in open spaces, causing minimal damage. In another district, two bombs damaged several roof beams. It was also reported that bombs fell in a southeastern location. Before noon, the sirens were lifted. According to the Air Ministry, the Royal Air Force was very active yesterday over the English Channel and northern France. Fighter planes continued to patrol, shooting down an enemy bomber over the Channel in the morning and another enemy plane in the afternoon. In the afternoon, a squadron of British bombers, escorted by a large group of fighter planes, flew over northern France and bombed the Saint-Omer airfield with considerable success, also shooting down two enemy planes in aerial combat. Five British fighter planes were missing. (Reuters, 6th)

London: A large squadron of British bombers, escorted by fighter planes, heavily bombed the snow-covered French coast yesterday. They returned in close formation, flying over the Strait of Dover at an altitude of five thousand feet. This was the second daylight raid in four days. After a flurry of snow at dawn over the Strait, the weather was quite clear. (The German government's news agency claimed that seventeen British planes were shot down in the raid on the Channel coast, two of which were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. There were no German losses.) At the same time, German planes also attacked southeastern and northeastern England. A night fighter shot down a German Heinkel aircraft near Margate, killing all crew members. (Tashun News Agency, 6th)

London: After the Royal Air Force heavily damaged the German invasion springboard the previous night, they bombed German bases on the French coast again last night. From Calais to Boulogne, red flames shot up everywhere, and the ground was ablaze. Despite fierce German resistance, dozens of British planes dropped countless tons of bombs on German bases. Flames and smoke columns rose nine thousand feet, penetrating the skies above Calais, Boulogne, Bordeaux, Ostend, and other German-occupied coastal cities. As British planes attacked over eight hundred miles of the Franco-Belgian coastline, fierce aerial combat broke out over the English Channel. The British claimed that seven German planes were shot down during the day, with five British planes missing. Furthermore, the work of the citizens after the Tuesday night raid has now ended. The Tuesday raid was the most intense in weeks. Several squadrons of German planes crossed eastern Midland, dropping bombs on a certain town and other parts of Midland. It was also reported that bombs fell in northwestern England, killing three people and destroying one house. (International News Agency, 6th)

Bangkok: Today, a government spokesman told a Reuters reporter that the "radio war" between Bangkok and Saigon, which had been temporarily suspended after the signing of the truce agreement, has now resumed. The spokesman asserted that Saigon has restarted it, leaving Bangkok with no other option but to retaliate with the same measures. (Reuters, 6th)

Vichy: The armistice agreement between Thailand and French Vietnam, mediated by the Japanese government, has been commented on by responsible officials here, stating briefly that the demarcation line of this agreement slightly encroaches upon Vietnamese territory, namely: (1) To the north of the protruding part of Thailand, this line is west of Yue Zeng City, the capital of Laos, encroaching into Vietnamese territory to the right bank of the Mekong River. (2) To the east of the protruding part of Thailand, it passes west of the Bak Su District, through Bassac Province, but does not reach the Mekong River. (3) To the south of the protruding part of Thailand, it passes north of Samrong City in Cambodia and west of Sisophon Town. The area between the Thai border and this demarcation line is designated as a "no-man's land" pending a final resolution. Thailand claims that Vietnamese troops have repeatedly violated the agreement and invaded this area. Foreign news agencies have also reported that Japanese troops have been permitted to land in Saigon to ensure compliance with the agreement by both Thailand and Vietnam. These are not true. In short, regarding the landing of Japanese troops in Saigon, the Vietnamese authorities have neither received a request from the Japanese side nor have they granted permission. The armistice agreement also does not contain such provisions. (Havas, 5th)

### After Lord Lloyd's Death, No One in Charge of the House of Lords, Successor Being Sought

London: Following the death of Colonial Secretary Lord Lloyd, the question of succession is quite complex, as Lord Lloyd was not only the Colonial Secretary but also the Leader of the House of Lords. Among the current members of the House of Lords who are also state ministers, only Dominion Secretary Lord Cranborne is a newcomer to the cabinet. Some suggest that Lord Hailey, the current Civil Defense Commissioner, should hold both positions. At the same time, others say that the Duke of Devonshire could be Lord Lloyd's successor. According to the British Constitution, the House of Lords must have two state ministers, so the current vacancy must be filled with a member of the nobility. (Reuters, 6th)

### British Blockade Policy Criticized by Spain

Madrid: The Spanish newspaper Arriba today published an article, threateningly criticizing the British blockade and "those who seek to paralyze Spain at home and abroad." It claimed that the Spanish people have lived peacefully since the end of a bloody war and have forgiven the enemies who have hindered their progress. But from now on, we must unite and be vigilant under the national flag. If we want to improve the situation at home and abroad and prevent Spain from becoming a desolate land inhabited by the last starving people of a formerly warlike nation, then we must replace words with action and prudent defense with an aggressive offensive. The time has now come. In recent days, newspaper editorials and speeches have constantly cited the blockade as one of the causes of the current food shortage in Spain. (Reuters, 6th)

### Sudan Donates £100,000 to Britain

### Philippe Receives Reporters, Discusses Municipal Measures and Views, Welcomes Opinions on Tax Issues, Police Agreement Seeks Resident Welfare

Yesterday (6th) afternoon at 3:00 PM, Philippe, Director-General of the Public Works Department and Director-General of Municipal Affairs, received Chinese and foreign reporters at the Bureau, expressing his views on municipal measures. He stated, in brief, that he was very pleased to have everyone present at the Bureau today, and would like to share his opinions on several municipal measures that are of public concern:

Committee Selection for Tax Research

Regarding the issue of tax fairness, much has been said recently. The Bureau has organized a committee to study this issue. The committee members are Mr. Fessenden, Mr. Jones, Mr. Mayhan, Mr. Okamoto, and Mr. Sun Ruihuan. Some people may raise questions, saying that three of the committee members have overly close ties with the Bureau. Such criticisms may occur, so I would like to take this opportunity to explain why we organized this committee and selected experts familiar with the Bureau's affairs to serve as members. The task of this committee is not easy, and their work must be expedited so that their report can be submitted to the foreign taxpayers' conference to be held in April this year. Therefore, the Bureau believes that those who undertake this work must fully understand the Bureau's current system and the principles and practices of taxation and be able to start work immediately to be effective. Mr. Jones has served as Director-General of the Bureau and is familiar with British tax law (the Bureau's taxation system is based on this law). Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Okamoto not only understand the Bureau's situation but also have legal knowledge of the customs of various countries. Mr. Mayhan has studied this issue extensively and has many opinions. Mr. Sun Ruihuan is the Deputy Manager of the New China Bank and has rich experience.

Humbly Adopt Opinions from All Sides

Please do not think that after the establishment of this committee, individual citizens will have no opportunity to express their opinions. We welcome all groups who wish to present their views to the committee, and taxpayers who wish to express their opinions on the tax system individually are also welcome. Please do not think that the Bureau hopes that the committee will only endorse the current system. The Bureau is well aware that there are unfair aspects of the current tax system and has repeatedly tried to find ways to remedy them. It would be a great thing if the committee could plan to eliminate the causes of inequality and place the tax system on a more equitable basis.

Reconsideration of Taxation Authority

I would now like to state something about several other matters. Some people believe that the Bureau should implement a completely new tax system. Although I do not want people to think that I am opposed to this view, I hope that you will consider several obstacles. For many years, the Bureau's lawyers have stated that the Bureau's taxation power is limited to dock dues, license fees, land tax, and house tax. The Bureau is prepared to ask for reconsideration of the expansion of the Bureau's taxation authority, but it should be noted that any tax or fee that cannot be implemented in court cannot be effective. Therefore, the taxes you pay should be a legal obligation recognized by the Public Concession Court. This is why the Bureau cannot exceed the provisions of the land contract.

New Tax System Difficult to Implement

Leaving aside these legal difficulties, please try to examine the proposed new tax system. Many people now believe that the Bureau should levy taxes on business profits. However, this is very difficult in Shanghai, and unless individuals pay taxes according to the same standard, this tax system is unfair. Consider how difficult it would be to calculate the true income and profits of individual citizens of different nationalities and businesses. If we want to implement it, the Bureau must hire a large number of investigators, auditors, and accountants, and the results of the investigation may not be reliable. Moreover, the Bureau does not have the authority to inspect business books.

Stock Exchange Tax Difficult to Sustain

Some may think that the Bureau can levy taxes on the stock exchange or other exchanges. Regarding this, I do not want to be misunderstood. The Bureau believes that it would be pleased to obtain any substantial income from the stock exchange or similar businesses, whether through voluntary donations or compulsory collection. But can we count on this tax revenue to meet the Bureau's regular expenses? When the stock exchange is booming, it is hoped that a considerable income can be obtained from taxation, but when its business declines, there will be no tax revenue. I therefore advocate that such taxes, if they can be collected, should be used for extraordinary and additional expenses.

Establishing a Quiet Power Agreement Aims to Maintain Order

Finally, regarding the recently established Shanghai West Police Agreement, this agreement is the result of several months of operation and is believed to be able to answer the outside world's comments on the Bureau. Some want the Bureau to take so-called direct action against the evils in the west, but if the Bureau implements direct action in areas where jurisdiction is still in dispute, the hope of establishing an agreement to restore order in the west may not be realized. I have also paid attention to comments of a completely different nature. Some have criticized the Bureau for negotiating with those whom they call "actual" officials. The Bureau is not involved in any form of politics. What the Bureau wants to do is to maintain normalcy for hundreds of thousands of Chinese and millions of foreigners in Shanghai. Anyone who can assist the Bureau in achieving this goal, the Bureau is prepared to contact them. Some have criticized the Bureau for demanding too much in the west. My answer is that the Bureau's only purpose is to do its best to fulfill its obligations to those who live on the roads outside the boundary, so that they can enjoy the benefits of the Bureau's services.

### The Board of Directors of the Bureau Suggests to the Consular Body the Date for the Election of Directors, and Will Schedule the Annual Taxpayers' Meeting, the Number of Directors of the Bureau Can Continue to Be Maintained

The aftermath of a verbal battle at the special meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession has not yet ended, and the preliminary action of another important struggle concerning the affairs of the Public Concession was launched yesterday (6th). The Bureau of Public Works has submitted the date of the Bureau's annual election of directors to the Shanghai Consular Body for approval, and holding the Annual Taxpayers' Meeting on April 16th is also under consideration.

Proposed Date for Election of Directors

According to responsible sources, the Bureau of Public Works has suggested that April 2nd and 3rd are appropriate dates for the election of the nine directors who will manage the affairs of the Public Concession in the next term. It is hoped that this request will be approved by the Consular Body within a few days. Upon receiving the Consular Body's reply on this issue, the Bureau will likely submit a request for the Annual Taxpayers' Meeting. The Bureau is currently studying April 10th as the best date for this meeting.

American Association Meeting Today

As for the proposed amendments to the election method proposed by the Japanese taxpayers during last year's election, no details are yet available. It is generally felt that unless some new methods are adopted before the next meeting of the Bureau of Public Works, the important results of the election will not change. According to news yesterday, the Executive Committee of the American Association of this city will meet today (7th). It is generally believed that the Association will nominate candidates in advance for the American director of the Bureau of Public Works. The usual procedure requires sufficient time for the American community to recommend other candidates, and then decide on the final American director candidates to be recommended.

Ratio of Number Can Still Be Maintained

It is heard that the Japanese Taxpayers Association has not yet decided on the date for nominating Japanese director candidates, but it is expected that the Association will do so soon. The Japanese side has not indicated today how many Japanese director candidates it will recommend, but it is generally expected that there will be at least five candidates, as in previous years. Based on the current number of votes of taxpayers in the Public Concession, the current situation of seven Western directors and two Japanese directors can continue to be maintained, as the current number of votes of Westerners is more than three times that of the Japanese. It is generally expected that Japanese taxpayers will soon take action to change the current election system and the procedures of the Taxpayers' Annual Meeting in the Public Concession.

### Reactions to the Passage of the Additional Tax Bill, the Difficult Situation of the Chinese Who Endure Pain Temporarily, the Japanese Indicate They Will Pay Taxes According to the New Regulations, the Bureau of Public Works Establishes a Committee to Study the Tax System

The special meeting of foreign taxpayers convened by the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession to discuss the additional tax bill has caused unprecedented serious disputes. Now the additional tax bill has finally been passed at the reconvened meeting, but the Chinese, who account for the largest number of taxpayers and the highest tax amount in the Public Concession, have no say in the additional tax bill at all. This unfair fact is deeply imprinted on the hearts of every Chinese. The general view of the Chinese is that at a time when the country is striving for overall revival, everyone should embrace the attitude of sacrificing the ego for the greater good. Therefore, they are extremely silent about the passage of the additional tax at the Taxpayers' Special Meeting and endure temporary pain to wait for the return of light.

Establish a Committee to Study the Tax System

The Bureau of Public Works, in accordance with the Director-General's statement at the Taxpayers' Special Meeting, has established a committee to study the current tax system, addressing the unfairness between owner-occupied properties and rented properties, and seeking ways to remedy it. The committee members are Mr. Sun Ruihuan, Mr. Fessenden, Mr. Jones, Mr. Mayhan, and Mr. Okamoto. The secretary is Mr. Gray. All public groups and taxpayers are welcome to submit their opinions to the committee. Letters should be sent to Mr. Gray at the Bureau of Public Works Director-General's Office.

The Burden on Residents Will Be Further Increased

The English-language Ta Mei Evening News stated that after the special meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession passed the resolution on the Bureau of Public Works' additional taxes and license fees yesterday (5th), there are many small taxpayers in the Public Concession today (6th) who are dissatisfied. In addition, the general public's reaction to the additional tax this morning is still good, with few continuing to criticize it, and they recognize this as an unavoidable step, as the Bureau of Public Works urgently needs more funds. Many taxpayers believe that the passage of the additional tax at yesterday's special meeting may lead to a continued increase in rents, which will further increase the burden on the residents of the Public Concession.

Japanese Will Pay Taxes According to the New Regulations

The Japanese taxpayers have opposed the additional tax bill from the beginning. It was rumored some time ago that if the additional tax bill was passed by the Taxpayers' Special Meeting, the Japanese intended to establish a sub-district in the northern district of the Concession and separate from the Bureau of Public Works. However, this statement has been denied by the Japanese side, claiming that this is unfounded. It is generally believed that Japanese taxpayers are considering paying taxes according to the new tax rate. However, according to the Japanese, Japanese taxpayers will still abide by the resolution of the previous Foreign Taxpayers' Special Meeting and pay taxes according to the new regulations. However, what will happen remains to be seen.

### The Deputy Director-General of the Bureau of Public Works Will Be Succeeded by Mitchell

The current Deputy Director-General of the Bureau of Public Works, Mr. Kennett, is about to leave Shanghai. The Board of Directors of the Bureau has now appointed Mr. Mitchell to succeed him in this position. The directors have praised Mr. Kennett's contributions.

### Improving the Rice Market: Municipal Council Proposes Suggestions to Prevent Hoarding, Speculation, and Manipulation; Rumors of Vietnamese Rice Shipments to Japan Proven False

To prevent hoarding, speculation, and profiteering in grains, the Municipal Council has approved the Grain Committee's recommendations and submitted the following measures to the Rice Market Management Committee for implementation:

Seven Measures

(1) All wholesale rice merchants should be automatic members of the rice market. (2) Reliable rice brokers should be registered and required to provide adequate guarantees, which must be deemed satisfactory by the Rice Trade Association. (3) Rice merchants should clearly record the sold rice in books or invoices. For each completed transaction, three copies of the sales slip should be prepared: one for the buyer, one for the market manager, and one for the seller. These slips must specify the price, quantity, quality, and the names and addresses of both parties. The Municipal Council may dispatch personnel to inspect all books, invoices, and sales slips at any time. (4) All wholesale transactions in the city should be concentrated in the rice market. The current practice of purchasing at least ten bags per transaction should be maintained. A deposit of five yuan per bag should be paid upon completion of the transaction, and delivery should be made within five days; otherwise, the deposit will be forfeited. (5) The practice of publicly announcing daily rice prices should be strictly enforced. (6) Up-to-date statistics should be maintained on futures purchases, rice arrivals, inventory levels, and the location of stored rice. (7) Trading in rice that has not yet arrived should be limited to reliable wholesale rice merchants.

Continued Sales at Fixed Prices

Since the Shanghai Fixed-Price Rice Committee began selling Saigon broken rice at fixed prices, it has greatly benefited the common people and contributed significantly to addressing the city's overall food supply issue. The eighth phase of fixed-price sales concluded on January 19. This reporter learned from the committee yesterday that it has decided to continue the ninth phase of broken rice sales at fixed prices in accordance with the authorities' intentions. Recently, foreign rice has been flooding into the city, and inventories are growing, with rice prices expected to fall. However, ordinary people still lack the means to purchase it, so preparations are underway for the ninth phase of fixed-price rice sales. A meeting will be convened in the next few days to discuss specific measures before a date is set.

Vietnamese Rice Prices Unchanged

Rumors in the rice market have now been proven false. The Shanghai rice industry received a telegram from its counterparts in Saigon yesterday reporting that the Vietnamese authorities had previously agreed to transfer 80,000 tons of glutinous rice to Japan at the request of the Japanese side, but this sale has now been canceled. Therefore, negotiations were initiated with the Vietnamese authorities. Furthermore, a certain rice firm also received a telegram from its counterpart in Hong Kong, stating that rice prices there were unaffected by the current situation and remained stable. Shanghai rice merchants were relieved by this good news and now hold their goods, fearing unexpected losses, and have begun to release them gradually at the newly set price limits. The sudden increase in available spot goods has improved the rice market this morning, and sentiment is weakening. It is truly regrettable that Shanghai's rice prices rely on rumors. The city's food reserves are not small, totaling over one million bags. Meanwhile, the supply of foreign rice continues steadily, and the authorities of the two settlements are actively working to clear the way for the shipment of domestic rice to Shanghai. However, speculators are still ready to seize opportunities, which is truly disheartening.

### US Authorities State: No Withdrawal of Defense Forces from Shanghai; Rumor Offensive Originates from Germany and Japan to Obstruct Passage of Aid to Democratic China Act

According to the *Millard's Review*, which will be published tomorrow, rumors circulated in Shanghai last weekend that all American expatriates in the Far East would soon be evacuated. However, responsible American authorities stated that these reports were completely unfounded. The US authorities in China had previously issued an advisory to American expatriates in the Far East without essential business to evacuate, but there was no order to evacuate the US Marines, nor was there a deadline for all American expatriates to leave China within 30 days. Moreover, investigations by reporters have revealed that these rumors were spread by the Japanese and Nazis on Wednesday and Thursday to sway American public opinion against the passage of the Aid to Democratic China Act. This rumor offensive is not limited to Shanghai; Shanghai is being used as a transmission point.

### US President Liners Arrive in Shanghai in Succession; President Monroe Departs Southward; President Cleveland Arrives Tomorrow Evening

The American President Lines' round-the-world liner *President Monroe* arrived in Shanghai for the first time yesterday afternoon. The ship is scheduled to depart at 5:00 AM this morning for Hong Kong, Manila, and various ports in Southeast Asia before returning to New York.

*President Monroe*

Few passengers arrived in Shanghai on this ship, and it is said that there are not many passengers heading to Southeast Asia, only 36, all first class.

*President Jackson*

The next round-the-world liner to arrive in Shanghai will be the new ship *President Jackson*, which returned to Boston on the 3rd of this month after its previous voyage to Shanghai and then departed from Boston on the 4th for its second round-the-world voyage. It will depart from New York today and arrive in Shanghai on the 19th of next month.

*President Hayes*

The third new ship, *President Hayes*, has also been launched and is currently being painted and outfitted. It will depart from Boston on its maiden voyage eastward on the 4th of next month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on April 16th.

*President Cleveland*

*President Cleveland* is returning from Manila via Hong Kong and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 10:00 PM tomorrow (the 8th), according to the company. It will dock at buoys 12 and 13, and passengers will transfer to small company launches for disembarkation at the Custom House Wharf at 11:30 PM tomorrow night. The ship will stay in Shanghai for one night and depart at 9:45 PM on the 9th for Kobe and Yokohama, via Honolulu and San Francisco, before returning to Los Angeles. The company launch will depart from the Custom House Wharf at 8:15 PM tomorrow night.

### Japanese Newspaper Severely Criticizes Shooting and Arson Incidents; Believes It Will Lead to Disdain and Contempt; Actions of Lin Xiongji and Others Cannot Be Approved

The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that this morning (the 6th), the Japanese-language *Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun* published an editorial sharply criticizing the illegal actions taken by Japanese residents in Shanghai, such as Lin Xiongji shooting Ke Zaiwei and two Japanese attempting to burn down the bamboo shed at the ratepayers' special meeting venue. It stated that while the actions of Morinaga Matsunosuke and Kubo Moriakira in attempting to burn down the bamboo shed "may be worthy of sympathy" subjectively, they were illegal objectively. The future development of the International Settlement "may stimulate our nerves and sense of justice," but Japanese should avoid any action that invites disdain and contempt. In the past, there have been cases where Japanese actions with misguided motives have put the Japanese government in a difficult position, and this has happened more than once. Japanese may understand the actions of these Japanese, but foreigners are different from Japanese in many ways and cannot be expected to have the same reactions. The newspaper concluded, "We are no longer Japanese on islands, but Japanese in East Asia or the world. This point cannot be forgotten. We sympathize with Lin Xiongji, who is currently being questioned for shooting Ke Zaiwei, and with the two who attempted to burn down the bamboo shed, but we cannot approve of their actions."

### Special Court Heavily Guarded; Breach in Qipu Road Still Blocked

The breach in Qipu Road remains blocked. The Shanghai Municipal Council closed Qipu Road between North Zhejiang Road and Gansu Road yesterday evening to protect the First Special District Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. At that time, a gap was left open at Gansu Road, but it was not opened from yesterday onwards, as the road is now devoid of residents. Meanwhile, US troops are stationed in the courthouse day and night, and Chinese and Indian constables guard the ends of the barbed wire fence. During court sessions, judicial police guard the courtroom, while patrols and troops protect the outside. The Weihaiwei Road branch office is also under similar guard, so the security situation is becoming increasingly tight.

### Greek Community Commemorates Former Greek Prime Minister

The Greek community and Greek friends in Shanghai attended a memorial service presided over by Father John at the Orthodox Church at 55 Rue Henri at 5:30 PM yesterday (the 6th) to commemorate the late Greek Prime Minister Metaxas. Greeks around the world held ceremonies yesterday to commemorate the late Prime Minister. Metaxas passed away a week ago after undergoing surgery for a throat ailment.

### Commercial Ship Traffic for the Entire Last Year

Shanghai is the center of China's trade and the only major port in the Far East. Foreign shipping to China still occupies the most important position. In the 29th year of the Republic of China, a total of 3,750 commercial ships, totaling 12,091,167 tons, accounted for nearly 50% of the country's total, more than four times that of the Tianjin Customs. The following is a record: (1) Japan: 818 ships imported, 2,507,040 tons; 700 ships exported, 2,313,202 tons; (2) United Kingdom: 541 ships imported, 1,576,542 tons; 554 ships exported, 1,567,258 tons; (3) United States: 129 ships imported, 698,925 tons; 126 ships exported, 669,600 tons; (4) Norway: 174 ships imported, 477,991 tons; 177 ships exported, 475,097 tons; (5) Netherlands: 46 ships imported, 202,187 tons; 48 ships exported, 211,004 tons; others omitted.

### Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Increases Interest on Savings

The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau telegraphed that a proposal to increase deposit interest rates had been approved by the Quadrupartite Joint Treasury in its 45th board resolution.

The purchase amount for Class B bonds will also be reduced accordingly. For example, to purchase a five-year, ten-yuan bond, only 5.85 yuan is required, or 3.2 yuan per year.

### Salvation Army Appeals for Donations; Benevolent Association Distributes Winter Clothing

The Shanghai Office of the China Benevolent Association raised over 30,000 yuan in donations for winter clothing for orphans and refugee children last winter. They have already produced 5,000 sets of cotton clothing.

As of yesterday, they had received donations totaling over 56,000 national currency yuan. It is reported that several donations are expected to arrive from Shanghai and other cities. The Salvation Army's relief efforts for Chinese refugees in Shanghai are expanding significantly. They are distributing white rice to thousands of refugees daily and providing assistance to thousands of prisoners released from prisons each year. In addition, the Salvation Army also provides assistance to refugee beggars. Those interested in making donations can send them to the Salvation Army Headquarters at 40 Nanjing Road, Sassoon House.

### Security Gradually Relaxing at the End of Avenue Foch

Traffic at the western end of Avenue Foch, where the French Concession and the Public Settlement intersect, has been subject to strict inspections of pedestrians since the police departments of the two settlements erected barbed wire barriers. Yesterday morning, police officers removed some of the three barbed wire barriers, and vehicles and pedestrians are now only selectively inspected, with the situation being more relaxed.

### Shaoxing-Xiaoshan Disaster Relief Donations

### After the Establishment of the "Police Power Agreement," Gambling Dens Are Relocating; Six Nations Hotel Plans to Move to the Old Site of Little World; Nanshi Is Likely to Become a Den of Vice

The Da Guang News Agency reports that since the "Police Power Agreement" for the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Road Area was signed on the 1st of this month, there is a special annex to the "Agreement" stipulating that illegal businesses will not be allowed to exist within the area. It is rumored that the "Shanghai Western Special Police Department" will first order them to cease operations when it is established, and they will be shut down if they attempt to reopen in the future. The gambling dens in the Western District have now received notice from a certain party and are preparing to relocate to continue operating. The Six Nations Hotel at 346 Avenue Haig, the largest of these, has recently added new buildings to expand its facilities. Due to the pressure of the environment, it has chosen the old site of Little World on Fuyou Road in Nanshi to continue gambling operations and is currently sending workers to actively renovate it. Other gambling dens in the Dihua Road and Yuyuan Road areas are also moving to Nanshi and are currently looking for suitable premises. It is noted that gambling and opium dens are already rampant in Nanshi, so they will become even more rampant in the future. This second "bad land" is likely to become a den of vice.

### Bomb Explodes at the Rising Sun Building

### Major Landlord Conspires with Three Subtenants to Sue the Second Tenant for Eviction; Court Investigates and Rules Against the Major Landlord

Egg merchant Dai Huiquin leased three shop houses (namely, 624, 626, and 628 Tiantong Road) and a residential unit at number nine in the alley from the Hexing Real Estate Company, which was constructing a number of residences and shop houses at 612 Tiantong Road before August 13, for a brokerage fee of 3,600 yuan, intending to open the Xingtai Egg Store.

The construction of the houses had not been completed when the Shanghai War broke out. They were only completed on February 1, 1938. At that time, Dai used 628 shop houses to open an egg store due to the economic downturn, and sublet 624 and 626 to Huang Kecheng to open a Standard Coal Briquette Company. Both opened when the houses were completed. Dai's lease with the major landlord was for an indefinite term, while the leases with the subtenants were for

Fixed-Term Leases

Initially, there was no objection from any party. Later, due to the shortage of houses and large population in Shanghai, rents soared. The Hexing Real Estate Company gave Dai several blank lease agreements and asked him to change to a fixed-term lease, which Dai refused. When the leases of the houses sublet by Huang Kecheng from Dai expired, Dai wanted to take them back for his own use to expand the egg store, but Huang did not agree. As a result of the lawsuit, Huang lost. The Hexing Company then came forward and sued for an

Eviction Order, arguing that the lease agreement signed by both parties was for a fixed term and had expired. As a result, the presiding judge ruled that the lease agreement submitted by the Hexing Company had been altered and ruled against the Hexing Company. The Hexing Company then filed another lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, arguing that Dai had sublet all the houses, violating the terms of the lease, and requested that Dai be ordered to relinquish possession. The first instance ruled against Dai because three subtenants testified.

Dai appealed to the Second Higher Court, arguing that the major landlord had colluded with the three subtenants to deceive the court. Recently, he hired Yan Yinwu as his lawyer. After hearing the case, the Second Higher Court ruled that there was reason for Dai's appeal and recently ruled against the Hexing Real Estate Company.

### Dance Hostess Lin Xiaomei Pregnant, Accuses a Patron of Rape; Defendant Does Not Deny the Relationship but Questions the Time and Place

Lin Xiaomei (18 years old, from Shaoxing, also known as Ruyou), a dance hostess at the Metropolitan Dance Hall at 6 Wangdel Li, 6 Wangzhi Road, French Concession, accompanied by her mother, Lin Jinshi, filed a complaint with the Zhabei police accusing Yu Zhongyun (24 years old, from Taizhou), a former Soochow University student residing in room 503 of the New Asia Hotel on Guizhou Road, of rape. According to the accusation, she met Yu at the dance hall a year ago. In September, Yu lured her to rooms 503, 509, and 518 of the New Asia Hotel.

Consecutive rapes occurred six or seven times, and Lin's virginity was broken by Yu. At that time, Yu said that he would marry her, but now that she is about two months pregnant, Yu has abandoned her. Hua Detective Xue Youwen investigated and confirmed the facts. Yu was arrested and brought to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunji prosecuted him under Article 240, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code for obstructing family life. Lin Xiaomei, in her petition, stated that she did not wish to pursue the case. Questioned, Yu Zhongyun confessed that the

Relationship did occur, but the dates were in February of last year, and the last time was in June of last year. Therefore, it is questionable whether her two-month pregnancy is due to him. Because she was able to have a relationship with him, it is difficult to guarantee that she did not have the same facts with others. As for Lin Xiaomei's claim that her virginity was broken by him, it is also untrue, because my friend Wang, who is now in Hong Kong, had a physical relationship with Lin before me. Moreover, I have already married a wife and have children in my hometown, so how can I marry Lin as my wife? As for the location of the relationship,

It was not the New Asia Hotel, but the Paramount Ballroom and the Cangzhou Hotel. Police lawyer Qian argued that the article of the law cited by the police was not a complaint but a discussion, so even if the plaintiff does not wish to pursue the matter, it cannot be withdrawn according to the law and should be punished according to the law. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the testimony and declared the debate closed, postponing the sentencing for one week. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Weather Report

The Zikawei Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that the weather in Shandong is clear and cold, with strong northwest monsoon winds. In this area and south of Maanshan Island, the coastal weather is cloudy and cold, with strong northeast monsoon winds that will become stronger. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 51.4 degrees, and the lowest was 43.3 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 42.4 degrees, and the lowest was 36.3 degrees.

### Food Grains; Rice Weevils are Spreading Rumors Again, Saying that Rice Transshipped from Hong Kong Will Encounter Difficulties; Rice Prices Rose Again in the Afternoon Due to Hoarding

More foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's *Ninghai* arrived yesterday afternoon with 1,298 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docked at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession to unload. The Jardine Matheson Company's *Taisheng* also arrived in Shanghai at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday with 393 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. (Unconfirmed)

After foreign rice softened slightly in the early hours, the market in general stores stirred again yesterday morning, with sellers taking advantage of the situation to hoard goods and raise prices by about half a yuan. The special small batch opened at 82.8 yuan, and the small batch at 74.8 yuan. Eventually, due to the congestion of goods in the market, the price quickly eased. The momentum of the rise gradually subsided in the midday market, and prices stabilized. The market continued to fall near midday, and closing prices returned to the previous day's original levels. However, in the afternoon, rice merchants spread rumors that Hong Kong was not issuing permits for transport, and that transshipped goods would face difficulties. There are many goods waiting for transshipment. As a result, holders took the opportunity to raise prices, and short covering and restocking became very active. The market immediately soared, rising step by step. Futures were especially sought after as customers competed to hoard. No. 1 Saigon for February opened at 94 yuan in the morning and rose to 95 yuan, 96 yuan, and 96.5 yuan in the afternoon. Upper three months was 93.5 yuan and 94 yuan in the morning, and 95.5 yuan in the afternoon. Small batch spot price was 88 yuan in the afternoon and called for 90 yuan. January 15 and 16 was 87.6 yuan in the morning and also called for nearly 90 yuan in the afternoon. February was 87 yuan in the morning and called for 89 yuan in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 2 yuan, which was 1 yuan more than the night before. But 2,000 tons of new broken rice were sold cautiously, with No. 1 and 2 mixed rice at 75.5 yuan and No. 3 broken rice at 65.5 yuan.

Although the arrival of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica was still not large, the demand from the countryside was weak, resulting in a flat and tired market. Except for thick japonica, where arrivals and sales were similar and there was little price difference, thin rice fell by another half yuan. Qing Jiao Hu saw thin rice at 94.5 yuan to 94 yuan, and the original package at 98 yuan. Changbang special original white japonica was still at 107 yuan, 102.5 yuan for Qing Jiao Hu, Kunshan original white japonica at 1045 yuan, 101 yuan for Qing Jiao Hu, and second grade to 967 yuan.

The supply and demand for glutinous rice were equal yesterday, and the market was unchanged. Hong Kong high white yuan was still 80 yuan, the general market white yuan was 79 yuan to 78.5 yuan, special goods were scarce and not opened.

### Wheat Flour Without Problems - Further Thoughts Presented -

Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the flour market turned sluggish, mainly because Australian wheat flour arriving by land was being offered for sale, and the problem of supply sources may not be too obstructive. This led to a softening of sentiment, and some speculators were willing to sell. The market opened with some resistance, but soon transactions occurred for "Flower Bird Clock Tower" brand Australian flour at 24.8 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Land-route goods also opened at 24.5 yuan, with nearly 10,000 bags sold. It is said that buyers were trying to depress prices. With rice prices also falling, there is fear of further price declines. "Gathering Treasure Basin" flour also had 2-300 bags traded at 24.4 yuan. Chinese-produced flour was still selling at 23 yuan, with the two factories releasing about 6,000 bags. Merchant groups had not yet accepted this price.

Wheat: The market remained persistently sluggish. Some domestic goods occasionally arrived, mostly directly allocated to factories, especially Japanese factories, which bought the most. This is because the environment is controlled by certain parties, so Chinese factories cannot buy wheat and have to rely on foreign wheat. It is said that Fuxin Factory has ordered a shipload of wheat, which will arrive soon.

### Finance: Chinese Banks Sell, Foreign Merchants Buy; Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Adequately Matched

Foreign Exchange: Yesterday, the exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for British and American currency was relatively active in the afternoon, but fluctuations were still minor. Chinese merchants heavily invested in gold and sold foreign exchange, but it was absorbed by foreign banks, and the market price was not affected. One American bank was particularly active in buying. US dollar for the current month traded at 5.3125 yuan. The future market was flat with little activity and stable sentiment, and the closing result was no different from the afternoon. Spot British pound was 3 pence 32825, and US dollar was 5.3125 yuan, with no change from the previous day.

American Banks Bought the Most Actively

In the early morning, London's large-scale transactions, both near and far term, were flat. New York silver prices remained low, and London spot gold was stagnant. Exchange rates for the British pound and Shanghai and the US dollar and Shanghai did not change. There was no market for French francs. The central bank's listed rates remained the same. The banks opened with a spot selling price of British pound at 3 pence 328125 and US dollar at 5.3125 yuan, the same as the closing price of the previous day. After opening, Chinese banks continuously sold, and the market was firm. The profit from selling spot US dollars to British banks was 5.34375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates did not change, and the silver equalization tax also remained unchanged. Later, there was still some negative news in the market, so Chinese speculators sold, but foreign banks were buying, especially one American bank, which bought the most at a relatively low price. It is estimated that this month, the American dollar was taken up by a Macgarity American bank from speculators at 5.3125 yuan. Until noon, it was reported that Chinese speculators sold the next month's US dollar, which was bought by the Chinese banks Dongya, at a price of 5.28125 yuan. The market closed quietly, with spot British pound at 3 pence 328125 and US dollar at 5.3125 yuan.

Few Inquiries About Future Market

The future market was sluggish, with few inquiries about the British and American currencies, resulting in no transactions and no price changes. The evening close was the same as the afternoon price. Spot and current-month British pound was 3 pence 328125, US dollar was 5.3125 yuan, March British pound was 3 pence 3125, and US dollar was 5.28125 yuan, with no change from the previous day's closing price.

Hong Kong American Dollar Slightly Looser

Hong Kong, 6th (Thursday): The exchange market opened steadily this morning, with no gains or losses for any currency. At 11:30, it remained steady, with no changes. At 2:30 pm, the report was flat. Spot US dollar loosened 0.0625 to 23.875 yuan. Spot Shanghai currency rose 0.5 yuan to 449 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.

Tianjin British and American Fixed

Tianjin, 6th (Thursday): The exchange market opened flat today. London and New York telegraphic transfers had no gains or losses, remaining at 3 pence 65625 and 5.84375 yuan respectively. Shanghai currency also remained unchanged, opening at 90.05 yuan. "Joint banknotes" in the black market alone rose 1 yuan to 78.25 yuan.

### Futures Firm, Cash Advances, Approximately 70-80 Yuan Higher

Yesterday, the black market price of spot silver ingot was pulled up from weakness, consistently holding above 6670 yuan, once rising to 6705 yuan. This was because the US dollar weakened due to the possibility of the US freezing funds. After exchange merchants sold in the previous two days, they bought again, creating a buying trend. After opening, Dafeng, Yufeng, Yonghesheng, and Chengji, among others, searched and bought, finally rising to 6705 yuan. At noon, it settled at 6690 yuan. The market opened well in the afternoon, reaching 6700 yuan, but silver shops like Tianyuan sold, and the lowest price was 6676 yuan. The closing result was 6683 yuan, up 6 yuan from the previous day. Cash continued to rise. Shihe sold Defu 130 taels, 70 yuan higher than futures price; Dada sold Gonghe 100 taels, 75 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Hengji sold Tongkang, Yongfu, Kangyong, Tianyuan, and Defu 90 taels, 80 yuan higher. Approximately 7,000 taels were traded in futures. Gold ornaments and customs gold remained flat.

Spot Silver Ingots Without Large Fluctuations

In the early morning, continuing the sluggishness of the previous day, sentiment remained uninspired. At the opening, various groups competed to sell, pushing the price down by more than 20 yuan, and the opening price was 6650 yuan. However, due to the weakening trend of the exchange market, exchange merchants bought spot silver ingots again, selling US dollars. Therefore, buyers came at the right time, and groups such as Dafeng, Yufengyong, Hesheng, and Chengji all bought, slowly rising above 6700 yuan, with the highest reaching 6705 yuan. However, some bulls, such as Chengji and Xiangxingyong, slightly exited, hindering the upward trend and slowly falling back into the 6700 yuan range, retreating to 6682 yuan. After this, it fluctuated slightly, stabilizing at 6690 yuan in the afternoon. The opening in the afternoon was good, at 6695 yuan. Before long, there was a rush to buy on the table, rising another 5 yuan to 6700 yuan. However, Tianyuan and other silver shops suddenly sold, forcing the price down to 6677 yuan. Fortunately, Xinyuan and Dafeng absorbed, rising back to 6690 yuan. Finally, Tianyuan continued to sell, and the market closed at 6683 yuan, a rise of 6 yuan compared to the previous day. Initially, Dada Cheng, Defu, Jin, Jufeng, Yongjingfu, and others bought two to three hundred taels of spot goods, with prices 70 yuan higher than futures. Later, Hehe bought Yida 100 taels, reaching 75 yuan. In the afternoon, Defu Hengji sold Tongkang a total of 90 taels, for 80 yuan. The whole day's futures fluctuated by 55 yuan. The selling price of the gold shops' own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than spot silver ingots, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current price of standard gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold.

Price of Gold Ornaments Unchanged

The exchange price for gold ornaments per tael was listed at 690 yuan by the Da Tong Hang, unchanged. The Xin Tong Hang's price was similar to the previous price, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower.

### Minor Gains in Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the price of spot silver ingot fluctuate, eventually trending slightly higher. British and American gold pounds rose slightly before falling back to flat. US dollar notes rose from 18.5 yuan to 18.6 yuan, finally settling at 18.55 yuan, a slight increase of 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise by 0.01 yuan. Japanese gold notes continued to rise, reaching 1.65 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes weakened slightly, retreating to 1.31 yuan in the evening market.

### Securities: A Watch on the Public Bond Market

The public bond unofficial market continued its downward trend yesterday, although the decline seemed to have slowed slightly. The environment remained unchanged, but the weakness in sentiment persisted. On the one hand, cash notes could be transacted; on the other hand, cash notes were maturing, absorbing and re-absorbing. Although the two sides seemed to be evenly matched, sellers seemed to be following the market, while buyers were buying at the lows. One side was selective about price, while the other was not. The difference between them was obvious. The opening price of Category C bonds was the same as the previous day's 64.7 yuan, but then gradually declined, falling by more than 1 yuan. After multiple rounds of absorption, it suddenly improved by 0.8 yuan. The competition between bulls and bears still favored the bears, but the strength of both sides was better than before. Previously, the sellers were large investors; now, the sellers were small investors. Previously, the buyers were small investors; now, the buyers were large investors. Considering this situation, the bulls would still be at an advantage in the long run, although they would suffer losses in the short term. Yesterday's sellers included Xinfu, Hu Heji, Runli, Yizhong, and Yuxing, each selling no more than 100,000. Others, such as Shengchang, Jiufeng, Dunyu, and scattered small investors, were limited in number. The buyer, Tongkang alone, bought approximately 500,000. Others, such as No. 16 Xinhua, No. 25 Shengda, and No. 38 Hengkang, each bought more than 100,000. Wanchun absorbed both Category C and Category E bonds, totaling more than 200,000, all buying for its own account. Others, such as Lianhe, Xinchang, Datong, Renchang, Hengfu, and Lianyi, all bought considerable amounts. This shows that there is no problem with the public bonds themselves; it's just unnecessary anxiety. The current decline has been significant, so there must be substantial support. The market price eventually fell by another 0.5 to 0.75 yuan. The total number of transactions was approximately 2.2 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 32 yuan each.

The stock market opened slightly firm, but then became extremely dull. Wheelock Marden reached a high of 109 yuan, a price that led to a large number of sellers, and closed at 106 yuan with buyers. Transactions for other stocks were also scarce, and rubber stocks showed no improvement.

London, 5th (Wednesday): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant stocks remained sluggish, with no changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: More Cotton Yarn Imported, "Double Horse" Turns from Decline to Rise

The yarn market initially weakened but then firmed, maintaining a positive trend. Although current yarn sales were not strong, buyers' sentiment was exceptionally enthusiastic. Securities firms and Ming Feng Hao came to bulk purchase and import. As a result, the market became dry, and the market turned from weak to strong. The difference between the high and low prices was as much as 30-40 yuan. The highest price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1512 yuan, and the low price was 1476 yuan. In the afternoon, it initially traded at 1517 yuan, then at 1510 yuan. Also, 1935 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.

The "Double Horse" market opened with most watching and waiting, due to the listless sentiment of the previous afternoon and the very active bears. The opening price was 1480 yuan, a slight drop to 1476 yuan. At this time, the market fluctuated within 4-5 yuan for about 1.5 hours. Later, due to the large-scale absorption by securities firms and the substantial volume, along with slightly positive rumors, the buying trend in the market suddenly intensified, and speculators panicked and actively covered short positions. The market gradually advanced, and the market price rose higher and higher, closing at 1511 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics were 7040 bales. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn rose by 20 yuan. The amounts purchased by each group are listed separately as follows:

Same Trade: 7,000 Hong Kong: 40 Total: 7,040

### Manufacturers Wait and See, Cotton Prices Slightly Lower

The current cotton situation turned flat, with manufacturers being less receptive. As for the same trade, it was not as enthusiastic as the previous day, so the market trend showed a slight decline. Also, 316 bales of cotton arrived from Hong Kong yesterday (6th).

The New York cotton market first fell due to selling by Southern speculators, then rebounded due to the strong rise in Wall Street stocks and buying by the same trade. As a result, the closing price was slightly higher than the previous day by one or two points. The Indian market was flat. Yesterday, including forecasts, it depreciated slightly by about one rupee.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Because cotton prices were rising, those holding goods were unwilling to sell easily. At the same time, manufacturers turned to wait-and-see attitude due to high prices. Therefore, although the market was firm, few transactions occurred. However, the cotton market base was solid, and yarn prices were stable, so the prediction for the future of the cotton market was optimistic.

### Piece Goods: Factory Prices Don't Loosen, Cotton Cloth Initially Declines Then Rises

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market fell then rebounded, with a stable trend. Although speculators tended to sell, the factory prices did not loosen. After the same trade bought at low prices, it rose again. However, as a result, plain white coarse and fine cloth and twill cloth still fell by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece. Part of the bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 0.5 yuan per piece. Fine yarn goods were the firmest. 42-count plain silk crepe was selling for 1.45 to 1.55 yuan per yard. Fugui fine cloth initially sold for 44.5 yuan, then rebounded to 45.25 yuan in the afternoon. More than 300 pieces of cloth were transacted on this street. Zhejiang Ningbo merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth. Fujian merchants handled nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill silk crepe, etc. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored twill and blue cloth, etc. Today, 295 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: Morning declines, afternoon rebounds, and market trends turn upward. Plain white Dragon Head fine cloth opened at the lowest price of 49.2 yuan. Later, due to the rise in yarn prices and retailers purchasing, the price gradually rose. At closing, the transaction price was 49.89 yuan. Because futures continued to rise, sentiment became stronger. The unofficial market price for current bills of lading rose to 50.03 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge was 1.355 yuan.

"Exchange" afternoon closing prices: February 51.2 yuan, March 52.72 yuan, April 53.55 yuan, May 54.3 yuan, all rebounded by about 0.5 to 1 yuan per piece compared to the previous month.

### Oil Cakes: Cake Prices Slightly Rebound, Soybean Oil Suddenly Rises

Soybean Cake: Yesterday's futures market trended downward due to active selling. Later, the bulls fought hard and forcefully raised the price. The price only fluctuated by 0.03-0.04 yuan compared to the previous market. Shengji sold 30,000 cakes for March delivery, with prices ranging from 15.25 yuan to 15.12 yuan, then back to 15.2 yuan. Another 20,000 cakes for the second half of March delivery were priced from 15.4 yuan to 15.3 yuan, then to 15.38 yuan. Yuanlong sold 5 cars for the second half of February delivery, priced at 15.25 yuan, and 10 cars for the second half of March delivery, priced from 15.31 yuan to 15.35 yuan. Feizi sold 10 cars for the first half of February delivery, priced from 15.25 yuan to 15.3 yuan. Because all parties were slow in handling spot cakes, sellers feared prolonged unprofitability, so they adopted a sales strategy of lowering prices. Initially, domestic merchants sold 6,000 pieces of Lizibing cakes at 14.8 yuan. Shengji cakes sold 1,000 pieces at 14.9 yuan. Hong Kong merchants followed up and purchased 3,000 pieces of Fazibing cakes at 14.95 yuan. The market price was uniformly about 0.4 yuan lower than before.

Soybean Oil: After falling for consecutive days, the market continued to decline in the morning. Later, a buying trend suddenly emerged, and both futures and spot oil turned upward. As a result, it exceeded the previous day's closing price, with the market rising by 0.5 yuan. 300 barrels of Dalian oil were transacted, priced from 118 yuan to 117.75 yuan, then rebounded to 119.25 yuan. Also, 500 barrels of futures oil, with the price for the second half of February being 118.5 yuan to 119.75 yuan, and the price for the first half of March being 120.05 yuan to 120 yuan, then rising to 121.75 yuan. Dayou factory oil sold for 50 dans, priced at 93 yuan.

Exports: Miscellaneous grains, today (7th), 1,285 bags of beans and 9,580 sheets of bean cake were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Raw Whites Rebound Slightly

Yesterday's sugar market did not fluctuate much. The guild set the price of spot goods, with the first settlement of raw white sugar on January 10th at 81.56 yuan for outer warehouse, down 0.1-0.2 yuan. The 20th settlement was 81.78 yuan, and the 24th settlement was still 81.9 yuan. The end of February settlement was 82 yuan, down 0.2 yuan, and the March 10th settlement was 82.4 yuan. Dutch cotton white BS mark was 79.9 yuan, up 0.4 yuan. Taikoo cart white B mark, west warehouse, was 81.3 yuan, unchanged. DY mark was 78.9 yuan, HX mark was 78.8 yuan, and Crystal Bright ice was 104 yuan.

### Hardware Black Iron Billets Soaring

The hardware market has been rising sharply since the opening of the red market, with prices about 50% higher than before. As a result, industry sentiment is very strong, but buyers are afraid to take action, so transactions are not very lively. However, there were many inquiries about black iron billets, so transactions were very smooth, and the market was soaring. Those with goods were even more bullish, and asking prices rose steadily, 100-200 yuan higher than the red market. Yesterday's opening price was already 1,600 yuan. Also, 153 pieces of tin arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### The Shanghai Flour Market in 1930 (Continued)

— Zhou Xigeng

If each household needs 3.5 bags of flour, then approximately 7,000 bags are needed. Other sales include biscuit factories, candy stores, dim sum shops, seasoning factories, yarn factories, and household use, which are not included. If we consider that flour factories at the time produced over 9,000 bags of flour per day, supply and demand could have been close, and there would have been no significant shortage. However, there was a lot of speculative capital in Shanghai, and speculators took the opportunity to manipulate the market, causing unrest among the public. The Municipal Council, in view of this, again intervened in late September to regulate the market (with each bag costing 16.8 yuan including handling fees), so the flour market gradually entered a peaceful state. This was maintained from September 27th to the end of the year. A total of three phases of cheap flour sales were held. However, in December of last year, due to the relationship of raw materials of our factory, the supply was reduced. The number of deficits was made up by the Municipal Council selecting one tenth of the foreign flour imported into Shanghai by Weida, Heyi, Dafu, Yihuo, and Gongli. The price was still the same as the native flour. The benefits for the civilians were truly not small.

Miscellaneous Brands of Flour and Rebagged Flour

In the Chinese flour mills within the occupied areas, those that did not suffer from war damage were taken over by the Japanese one by one, or those with special relationships were allowed to restore themselves. According to what we know, listed as follows:

### XZ School Incident Creates New Complications, Relevant Parties Prepare for Arbitration; Both Sides Approaching Extremes, Mediation Nears Collapse; If Not Resolved Today, Arbitration Will Be Implemented Tomorrow

(Dahua News Agency) Qunxian Villa, Jinshenfu Road, in this city, at the private Xingzhong Middle School, near the end of the last semester, a portion of the teachers demanded improved treatment but failed. A strike occurred. The resolution of various circumstances by relevant parties was reported by various newspapers. Now, with the start of the new semester, new complications have arisen. The school's attitude is firm, and the teachers have left the school again. Despite exhausting mediation, it still resulted in a rupture. Relevant parties believe that both sides are approaching extremes and are on the verge of collapse, and they are preparing to implement arbitration to resolve the outstanding case. Details are as follows:

Initial Incident - Causes and Consequences

The initial strike at the school occurred near the end of the last semester. Eight female teachers participated in the strike. Their original demands were: (1) double salary for January of this semester; (2) a 50% salary increase starting next semester; (3) salary for six months starting next semester; (4) no unjustified dismissal of faculty and staff; (5) no arbitrary insults to teachers; (6) a rice subsidy for non-resident teachers. As a result of the mediation, the school accepted the following items: (1) a 30% to 40% salary increase starting next semester; (2) no unjustified dismissal of faculty and staff; (3) all teachers can live in the school. At that time, the strike subsided, and both sides were at peace.

New Complications - Second Strike

Unexpectedly, at the start of this semester, the school principal, Wu Jingbo, believed that two teachers, Xu Heng and Wu Tianjing, were substitute teachers and had no contract with the school. He believed that he was not bound by the above mediation agreement. Therefore, on the one hand, he invited the original teachers to work at the school. On the other hand, he notified the substitute teachers that they did not need to substitute. As a result, one of the original teachers returned the contract and did not want to be hired. The principal hired someone else to replace him. Disputes arose from this. The teachers believed that the substitute teachers Xu Heng and Wu Tianjing had served for nearly half a year, and the principal did not officially hire them but insisted that the original teacher return to work at the school. It was obvious that he was playing tricks to achieve his goal of dismissing them on purpose. They unanimously protested, demanding that the two substitute teachers be formally hired as formal teachers. The principal sternly refused, and his wife, Mrs. Liu (who also taught at the school), spoke rudely. The teachers felt insulted, and the situation became more tense, leading to the unfortunate event of a second strike.

Mediation Breaks Down - Preparing for Arbitration

After the second strike, the teachers requested that relevant parties continue to send personnel to mediate. The original mediator was assigned to handle the matter, but despite efforts, little progress was made. Three of the teachers suddenly returned to work and resumed classes as usual. The others, such as Ge Fengzhen, resigned in anger, expressed their determination, and engaged in indiscriminate publicity, disregarding the overall situation. The situation became increasingly dire. Although the relevant parties sent personnel again yesterday morning for a final mediation, urging the school authorities not to close the last door for negotiation, the result was still a failure, and the mediation finally broke down. In order to resolve the matter quickly, the relevant parties are preparing to implement arbitration and first issued a severe warning to the teacher Liu Guo Fu, the principal's wife.

### Recent News from Shanghai Commercial Supplementary School

The Shanghai Commercial Supplementary School has been in operation for more than ten years. Starting this semester, the school has expanded classrooms and increased enrollment. Classes are scheduled to begin tonight. There are still vacancies in each grade. Starting this semester, a new class for English business conversation has been added, with classes from 9 to 10 pm every night.

### The First Day of Class

— Guo Wenqiang

In Shanghai (I don't know about other places), the "start of school" and the "first day of class" are disconnected. That is to say, school starts without classes immediately; classes begin several days after the start of school.

Today—three days after the school opening ceremony—school has started.

Crowds of people, classmates all brought their new books to class. Some even wrapped their new books in "picture paper," showing that they cherish things in a strange way. Most of the classmates are old, with only one or two new transfer students.

The first lesson and the second lesson are over, and the classmates are happily chatting and laughing.

"Why didn't Lao Fang come to class today?" Xiao Chen was the first to open the conversation.

"Don't just say today, he probably won't come to class tomorrow either. I heard he won't be continuing his studies this year." A classmate answered.

"Who said that?"

"Who else would say it? He said it himself. I ran into him the day before yesterday."

"Why is that? He's graduating after this semester." The classmates were all talking.

"Isn't it because he can't pay the tuition? The tuition for this semester has increased by twelve yuan again."

Lao Fang is a top student in the school, not very tall, very thin, and eloquent. Unfortunately, his family is too poor, living from day to day. I heard that his father works on a boat. He is a very kind person.

"Won't Lao Fang take the scholarship exams held by various schools?" Xiao Chen asked again.

"Maybe he will." In the end, Xiao Chen answered himself.

Xiao Chen and Lao Fang are very good classmates, you could say they are bosom friends. Of course, Xiao Chen was very uneasy when he heard that Lao Fang was going to drop out of school. Now he is making propaganda, trying to use the collective power to prevent Lao Fang from dropping out.

"Everyone, my friends, Lao Fang is a top student in our class. It's heartbreaking that he's dropping out of school because he can't pay tuition... We should help him, materially..."

The voice went from gentle to indignant.

The overflow of emotion was unstoppable. At this moment, everyone exposed their passionate hearts. Everyone couldn't help but say:

"Yes."

"We must help him!"

Xiao Chen was very happy, he felt that his words had a great effect. So he counted the classmates standing and sitting around him, thirty-three old classmates, two new ones, thirty-five in total. Xiao Chen spoke again:

"First of all, I'll help Lao Fang with five yuan. I hope everyone will donate as much as possible."

As soon as he finished speaking, classmates called out one yuan, two yuan, fifty cents...

The two new classmates also donated one yuan each.

Before long, a total of forty-three yuan and fifty cents was collected. From tomorrow, Lao Fang won't have to drop out of school. Everyone was very happy.

Xiao Chen was busy writing a letter, asking everyone to sign it, meaning to show their friendship and enthusiasm, with Xiao Chen as the representative.

In the evening, Xiao Chen went to Lao Fang's house. Lao Fang was so moved by the letter brought by Xiao Chen that he shed tears.

For the sake of a friend, and also for the sake of the country, this is a meaningful action.

### Random Notes

— Zhou Yinji

"Jesus, Amen!"

A six-year-old child and a seven-year-old daughter of a relative are studying at a large church school in the French Concession. But after studying for a whole year, they haven't learned anything. The only two sentences they can say are: "Jesus loves the world, we also love Jesus, Amen!"

Mechanical Pencils

One of my young sisters is studying at a certain girls' middle school on Lafayette Road. Today, when she went to school to pay the remaining fees, the school's head of academics actually used "mechanical pencils" as an incentive, saying: If you introduce one student, you can get a free pencil, etc. Hearing this, I can't help but sigh for the future of the sacred cause of education!

Foreign Songs

A friend of mine, in a conversation, casually said to me: "Now many young male and female students often like to hum foreign songs, but to be honest, some of them have never even taken an English class. He (she) sings "foreign songs," probably with Chinese annotations written next to them." At the time, I was so amused by him that I couldn't close my mouth. Although these are unconscious jokes, they are all a great satire of current education.

### A Disguised Tuition Increase

— Mo Leng

When schools increase tuition, teachers can take the opportunity to demand salary increases. As a result, the increased portion of tuition is reduced due to salary increases. Therefore, schools have to think of a perfect solution. On one hand, they want tuition revenue to increase, and on the other hand, they want to deprive teachers of any excuse to demand salary increases. This method is very simple, which is to desperately force students to take make-up exams, thereby increasing make-up exam fees.

My younger brother received a notice from the school that three of the six subjects he had chosen required make-up exams, and a notice was attached stating: "From next semester onwards, the make-up exam fee will be uniformly increased to five yuan per subject." At first, we thought that my younger brother's grades had declined, but later we learned that almost eight or nine out of ten of my younger brother's classmates had to take make-up exams.

Make-up exams are given because some students' grades are between passing and failing, giving them an opportunity. This situation was originally extremely rare, but now it is so common that we have to believe that the school is suspected of changing students' grades. The main method of changing grades is to reduce scores of sixty or seventy by several points to a dozen points, or even increase scores of thirty or forty by ten points to a dozen points, so that the majority of students will be forced to take make-up exams.

Every student has one or more make-up exam grades, averaging two per person, which is equivalent to increasing tuition by ten yuan per semester, while at the same time waving the banner that the school's tuition will not increase. And they tell the teachers, our work in the education field is the most sacred, we should endure all the pain to serve the education field.

Impoverished students often lose their chance at education, despite receiving help from relatives and friends, due to poor grades. However, these poor grades are not due to the students' own lack of effort.

It is chilling to hear that an educational institution is using improper methods to seek profit; and misleading young people is even more sinful!

Several weeks ago, after the article "A Good News" was published in this column, I, who was about to suffer the pain of dropping out of school, felt that this was an excellent opportunity for me to continue my studies.

### A Record of Taking the Impoverished Student Scholarship Exam

— Wang

Truly a piece of good news for us impoverished students!

That night, I wrote a letter of application, applying for assistance.

Three weeks later, a reply came, asking me to come for an interview on a certain day. Although this was just a thin postcard with only a few words on it, it gave me a flower of hope to continue my studies.

A not-too-big, not-too-small living room, neatly arranged, decorated in a mix of Chinese and Western styles, with calligraphy and paintings of celebrities, antiques, soft sofas, chrome coffee tables, and a redwood eight immortals table. On one side of the wall, there was even a couplet handwritten by Yuan Lida, the director of the Orphanage, praising the owner's charitable acts, which was enough to prove that the owner was a kind and generous elder. More than a dozen applying students sat quietly around the long round table, waiting for the exam. At 1:00 PM, the exam began. Each person had to write one essay in Chinese and one essay in English. The Chinese topic was "Self-Description," and the English topic was "My School Life." Afterwards, the exam papers of the test takers were all graded, and the students who received the scholarship could go to the location to collect the scholarship the next day. Luckily, I was one of them.

The person who gave us the scholarship and enabled us to continue our studies was a kind and gentle elder surnamed Pan. When receiving the scholarship, Mr. Pan personally inquired and then issued the scholarship. When I was called upstairs for inquiry, Mr. Pan very politely asked me to sit down. After the questions were completed, he told me the following:

"When I was studying, I was also a poor and impoverished student. In order to study, I often encountered various difficulties. However, I was not discouraged, and eventually succeeded. In view of the difficult circumstances I faced during my studies, I feel sympathy for current impoverished students, so I have set up ten scholarships each semester to help impoverished and outstanding students. I hope you will not disappoint my sincerity. If you achieve success in the future, you should also recall your difficult circumstances when you were studying and help other impoverished students."

I received the scholarship, and my heart was filled with joy, because I could continue my studies. Here, I represent all impoverished students in expressing our infinite respect to Mr. Pan.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

"Actually, she can't be considered tall, just the right height! Her face and body exude a very lovely delicate charm. I really like her! Every time we eat, I always have to turn my face to look at her!" Another third-grade student said innocently.

In fact, there are many classmates who like Luo Xiangqi. She treats everyone very kindly. Although she gets first place every year, she is less pretentious than those who repeat grades every year. Although her family is very poor, she dresses more neatly than the richest people. She can follow the teacher's words appropriately, but never excessively flatter them. For four years, she has never committed a fault. Even Principal Hou, who is so eccentric and likes to be critical of everything, cannot help but secretly admit that she is his most proud student.

When Principal Hou decided to appoint her as the representative to give the speech of thanks, he was unexpectedly calm. She did not exhibit any of the pretense that girls commonly display, such as crying, laughing, or making repeated refusals. Although several of her classmates, who were jealous of her, were constantly sarcastic towards her, with some pretending to be happy for her, saying a long string of well-wishes that were more malicious than insults, and others pretending to be worried for her, urging her to decline the position to Principal Hou, Luo Xiangqi's response was always just a faint smile.

Indeed! Xiangqi really took this matter very lightly in her heart. Before Principal Hou appointed her as the representative, she really did not expect others to recommend her. Once Principal Hou circled her name, she immediately felt that this was a very ordinary obligation, just like she had been appointed as the class leader for the past three years, not worth marveling at, but also not necessary to decline. She thought that going on stage to face her entire school and a few guests, and giving a polite speech like reciting from a book, what was so surprising about that? If she gave a good speech, people would just applaud and be done. If she didn't give a good speech, people wouldn't necessarily boo her off the stage. It was just a short time, and surely it wouldn't be more difficult than regular homework.

Although it was not difficult, the impact that this short speech later had on herself was certainly not what she had anticipated! The course of her life, as a result of this speech of less than ten minutes, went from a very smooth and minimally winding road to another bumpy and dangerous path. If she had known beforehand that there would be such a result, she would certainly have preferred to be expelled by Principal Hou, and resolutely refuse to be this ominous representative! (24)

New Movie Introduction

### "The Mark of Zorro"

— Cheng Bingnu

Twenty years ago, Fanbonk's "The Thief of One Green" was a sensation. Twenty years later, Taylor Power's "The Mark of Zorro" is still loved by audiences. Undoubtedly, the script is quite exquisite, and the development of the story is full of tension and twists. I have not seen Fanbonk's "The Thief of One Green", so I cannot compare the two films. But imagining it, a character like Diego, played by Fanbonk, would certainly have more than enough charisma, but perhaps not enough charm. Similarly, no matter how hard Taylor Power tries, his charisma should always be less than that of the old Fan.

The story of "The Mark of Zorro" is about how the green-shirted people of 18th-century Spain were abused under the rule of the tyrant Don Luis. Of course, the people would not always be willing to be cattle and horses, so the protagonist Diego came out in the guise of a masked hero to eliminate violence and bring peace. He has excellent martial arts skills, he can fence, he can ride horses, he dares to openly tear down the notices of officials increasing taxes, and he also dares to break into the official residence in the middle of the night to play tricks on the cowardly tyrant Don Luis.

But when he takes off his black mask, he becomes Don Luis's friend, a young and handsome gentleman. He accepts the teasing of Don Luis's wife, and also accepts the infatuation of Loreta. He is knowledgeable in romantic affairs, and he knows how to cherish women. Such a character is naturally a hero in the eyes of the people at the time. Beauty loves a hero, and Loreta's infatuation with Zorro is a natural occurrence. (Attached copper picture)

Although the playwright did not emphasize the romance of the male and female leads, the writing of the suffering of the people, and the resistance arising from the suffering, seems to be insufficient. Similarly, his writing of Diego's fencing and horse riding only depicts a vigorous hero, while neglecting the countless unnamed commoners who support this hero—the people. This method of eliminating violence for the people is purely individual heroism. If it was not Diego who led this uprising, there would be a risk of failure.

Perhaps director McMullen knew of this defect, and in the final escape from prison climax, he especially emphasized the roar, cheers, and participation in the resistance of the people. That grand scene is exciting enough. As for the brisk tone of the whole play, and the concise and smooth pictures, there is naturally nothing to criticize. Taylor Power's acting skills are much better than in "The Rains Came". Linda Darnell is also quite lovely. In short, this is a film worth watching.

### Watching Shenxin No. 2 Factory's Tongle Rehearsal

— Ashamed

The Shenxin No. 2 Factory Peking Opera Troupe holds an annual rehearsal during the Lunar New Year, both to delight all employees and to guide them towards proper recreation, avoiding unnecessary waste. This method is excellent. The plays performed this spring were quite wonderful. Here are some excerpts:

Shu Hen Ji. This play is an old one, rarely performed in Shanghai. Shen Shuwei plays Zhu Chundeng, with excellent singing and acting. He eats in Zheng Palace and above. The long section of Fan Erhuang during the sacrifice is the highlight of the play. Yu Zhangji's Zhao Jintang and Mr. Shen are evenly matched in skill, and his posture is particularly stable. Wu Qi's Zhu Chunke is quite helpful as a supporting role.

Eight Hammers. Chen Shouzhi as Wu Zuo, Liu Xiaonong as Lu Wenlong, Zhao Jinshen as the wet nurse. Mr. Chen sings in the Yu style, maintaining a good standard. The hanging hair when he cuts off his arm is high and light, showing great skill. In the section where he leaves the book, the eye contact between Lu and the wet nurse in a few lines of dialogue is particularly outstanding. (Attached stage photo)

Famen Temple. Li Ruiting's Zhao Lian sings better than he acts. When he leaves the stage, after a long section of slow board Er Liu, the phrase "Fang Da Dan" three words is raised, which is commendable.

June Snow. Miss Jun Ceng's Dou E has a clean and beautiful appearance, and has a gift for a good voice. She sings the Cheng style and has a solid foundation. This ring set, Liu Xiaonong plays Huang Tianba, Xu Jing plays Erdun. Mr. Liu is young and handsome, and his appearance is superb. His singing, acting, and spoken lines have a heroic spirit. Xu's voice is loud and clear. The passage of flowing water is clear and decisive. Wu Qi plays He Tianlong in reverse. The few fights between the dart and Mr. Liu are tight, skilled, and certainly not easy.

Three Mothers Teach Son. Zhu Zhonghua's Wang Chun'e, with a stable and flawless opening, several passages of Erhuang, singing in a desolate and gentle manner, is very pleasant to listen to. Zhou Ganshu's Xue Bao follows the old style and does not use greasepaint on his face. He sings the Wu Shaolou style. Little Sister Li Wenrong, who plays Yige, is Mr. Li Ruiting's daughter. Her lines are practiced and her expressions are lively, adding a lot of color to the play.

Killing the Fisherman. Ye Naijun's Xiao En, every move does not lose his heroic nature. The "Last Night" section of the original board is quite pleasant to listen to.

On that day, the performance lasted from 12:30 PM to 6:30 PM. The audience maintained excellent order. According to the person in charge of the factory's Peking Opera Troupe: "In the near future, we will hold another public rehearsal. We hope that the connoisseurs of Shanghai will not hesitate to give us their advice."

### Li Amao's Hygiene Mailbox

Taking supplements but forgetting to supplement strength is like entering a treasure mountain empty-handed.

(Mr. Shen Wuying asks) Wuying likes to pick his ears. Five years ago, he injured his ear while picking it at a barber shop. Since then, it often discharges water, causing pain and itching, which is unbearable. He has purchased various medicines to treat it, but all have been ineffective. May I ask what medicine should be used to cure it?

(Answer) All the orifices of the human body are like the seaports of a country, and no foreign objects may enter them; otherwise, it is easy to cause trouble, and this is not only true of the ear. Now that you have developed a disease, you should consult a specialist in otolaryngology to treat the condition. Ordinary medicines cannot cure it. In the future, when you go to a barber shop, you should refuse ear picking, because a moment of small pleasure often leads to great pain.
