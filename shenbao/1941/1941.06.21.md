### China's War Effort Receives International Aid, Victory is Within Sight: Outgoing Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui Bids Farewell to Colleagues in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Reviews China's Diplomatic Relations Over the Past Four Years

Chongqing: Foreign Minister Wang, out of respect, hosted a tea party at 3 PM on the 19th to bid farewell to all staff members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In his address, he stated that China had endured four years of arduous warfare, and the diplomatic environment had also weathered storms, which could be divided into three phases: The first phase was when China fought alone; the second phase was the period of international sympathy; and now it has entered the first phase, which is the period of international assistance. It is evident that international justice will ultimately be manifested under the clear blue sky. China's current war effort is akin to Columbus' discovery of the New World. The shore of victory is within sight. Although we have faced dangerous storms, we will ultimately reach the final destination of victory in the war. (20th Dispatch)

### Japanese Military's Westward or Southward Advance: Unable to Make a Final Decision, the War Against China Remains Unresolved, Further Southward Advance Entails Greater Risks, Frequent Reports of Chinese Military Victories on Various Fronts in the North and South

Chongqing: Spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission: News reported on the 13th that there were over two hundred Japanese warships gathered on the sea off Yuhuan (Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 16th). The Japanese concentration of a large fleet here is clearly not intended to deal with China. Japan may launch a large-scale advance in the near future, etc. A reporter asked me whether the Japanese would advance westward or southward. I said that if I were to consider it for the Japanese military, it would be advantageous not to advance westward or southward. Why? Speaking of advancing westward, in my report on the war situation last week, I mentioned that the Japanese military, considering (that eight divisions cannot resolve a single mountain in China), if they risk a westward advance, there will inevitably be unimaginable dangers. As for advancing southward, given the limited strength of the Dutch East Indies, it is possible for the Japanese military to stake everything on a single throw of the dice. However, judging from the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies' tough speech a few days ago, it is clear that he has confidence. The Japanese military is already unable to extricate itself from the war with China. How dare they create another enemy? Therefore, whether the Japanese military will truly advance westward or southward by force is a decision that has not yet reached its final stage. Within China, the war situation this week, except for some battles on the south bank of the Yangtze River and the north bank of the Yellow River, remains generally quiet. On the south bank of the Yangtze River, only southern Hubei and southern Anhui have slight movements.

Southern Hubei

(1) In areas such as Dashaping, Guikou, and Baini Bridge in Chongyang, over a thousand Japanese soldiers gathered and advanced southwards in multiple directions towards Fuling, Maitianfan, and Qinglinling on the morning of the 11th. The Chinese military resisted and ultimately prevented their success. (2) Over a thousand Japanese soldiers from Nanlin Bridge in Tongshan advanced towards Hengshi River and Baoshi River on the morning of the 12th. The Chinese military repelled them. (3) Over a thousand Japanese soldiers from Shan harassed the south on the 14th, and another unit attacked Fangshi Qian. On the 15th, they continued to attack the Dayoushi and Outangshi areas. The Chinese military is currently encircling and attacking them.

Southern Anhui

Japanese soldiers from areas such as Datong advanced towards Qiaotou and Yanghejiawan on the 12th. After being fiercely attacked by the Chinese military, the Japanese soldiers retreated in defeat. The Chinese military then recaptured Qiaotou and Yangke and continued to advance in pursuit. By the 13th, the original positions had been restored. It is estimated that over 600 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, including Japanese Captain Okamoto.

Yellow River

On the north bank and in the Shanxi-Henan-Shaanxi triangle area, there were small-scale battles. The Japanese military's objective was in Ruicheng. Japanese soldiers on the western route attacked from Fenglingdu and Beizhaocun. On the 11th, they attacked eastward through Xiaojia Town and Yongle Town. The Chinese army engaged them, killing many Japanese soldiers. On the 12th, fierce battles unfolded in the Dayangcun and Guren Cun areas west of Ruicheng. That evening, the Japanese military advanced to the outskirts of Ruicheng and joined up with the eastern route attacking westward from Monan Town and the northern route attacking from Shanyu Township. The Chinese military once again launched a fierce attack, shattering the Japanese positions. The Japanese military suffered heavy casualties. Except for a portion that was detained, most of them retreated. In addition,

Southern Henan

Japanese soldiers in Xinyang, gathering over a thousand soldiers, once again advanced in multiple directions. One unit attacked Yangmiao from Changtai, one unit attacked Luzhai from Banhe, and one unit attacked Chenjiadian from Muzhu River, advancing towards Pingchang Pass. The Chinese army was prepared and launched fierce attacks on them. The Muzhu River unit, although reinforced once, was immediately beaten back by the Chinese army. It is estimated that over 600 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle.

Southern Guangdong

The Japanese military advancing from Gujing and Mei was severely repelled by the Chinese army and suffered considerable losses. As for the Chinese military,

Editorial

### Difficulty in Choosing a School, Difficulty in Getting Accepted

Seeking knowledge is indeed a difficult matter, not difficult in reading books, but difficult in choosing a school. A good school, even if one is unwilling, will transform one into a virtuous person; a bad school, even with wisdom, will lead to shared depravity. Although this is not an immutable principle, it is a constant fact. Young people spend most of their time in school, spending more time with teachers and friends and less time with family. Therefore, while family education is important, school education is even more important. Today, due to the exigencies of the situation and limitations of the environment, universities in the Southeast have moved inland and concentrated in Shanghai. Shanghai is not originally a place for students to cultivate their moral character and study, the allure of pleasures, and the pursuit of wealth and profit are all sufficient to influence the will of young people, causing them to lean left or right, high or low. Instability of will leads to a lack of focus in studies, and without focus, the achievements that can be made are predictable. However, if schools can correct the malpractices of the times and show young people the way to conduct themselves in the world, it is not impossible to achieve positive results. But as academic levels rise, the degree of assimilation with society often deepens. It is evident that even with good customs and strict teaching, it is still no match for the ease of contagion of habits. If it is a case of descending to a lower level, then without those who practice diligently, have a strong will, and stand out from the crowd, few will not be assimilated imperceptibly. There is an old saying: "The poor do not learn extravagance, the rich do not learn frugality," meaning that it is a natural fact, and there is no need to learn it. But today's common ailment is that even with such national difficulties and such poverty among the people, they still indulge in comfort and poison, and indulge in ease and pleasure. The poor learn extravagance, and the rich become even more extravagant, leading to no shortage of aristocratic schools and teachers and students with a strong capitalist flavor, which is truly a great calamity in seeking knowledge. Young people are pure in nature, but the influence of customs is unavoidable. Being near vermilion turns red, being near ink turns black, five entries and five changes, the ease of change in character is such. Therefore, associating with honest and well-informed people brings the joy of having many virtuous friends; associating with flatterers and sycophants brings pride, idleness, and pleasure. Teachers should be happy to acquire and educate the talents of the world; students should also seek the teachings of famous teachers and good friends to achieve the effect of shaping and nurturing. In the past, Ma Yuan said to Emperor Guangwu, "In this day and age, it is not only the ruler who chooses the ministers, but the ministers also choose the ruler." I believe that seeking knowledge today is not only about schools choosing students, but students must also choose schools to attend. However, it is easier for schools to choose students, but difficult for students to choose schools.

Even if students have the desire to choose a school and study there, they must go through an entrance examination. Who can predict whether they will be accepted or not? The examination system is an old method from ancient China, and the abolition of the imperial examination was not only because of its prose but also because it relied on the length of a single day. Those selected were not necessarily all virtuous, and what was learned was not necessarily all practical. There were also corrupt practices involving connections and requests. Although those who violated the imperial examination regulations were subject to strict penalties, the malpractice never ceased, and those with influence could still easily advance. Therefore, it was attacked by those who advocated new learning. Can today's school entrance examinations not reveal the test questions to those they already know? Can they make admissions based solely on test scores without accepting requests and secretly accommodating them? Can they grade the test papers calmly and fairly, weighing every point without being swayed by emotions? In theory, this should not be the case. If it is, then the examination is merely a facade, following the bad habits of the imperial examination, which is definitely not what today's practical schools should do. However, the admission standards for the entrance examinations of various schools vary greatly in their strictness. If they are lenient, the test questions are simple, and the admissions are broad. After the students enter the school, they will be gradually eliminated based on their academic performance. There are also schools that believe the more students, the better. They accept all those who can barely pass, and everyone is on the list of successful candidates. This is losing through excessive leniency. If it is too lenient, the students' academic levels will be uneven, making it difficult to achieve a reasonable standard, which is not the way to learn. If they are strict, they deliberately play tricks on the test questions. They clearly study vernacular Chinese but test them with classical Chinese. They know that it is not a necessary subject, but they test them with necessary subjects. They do not read the Four Books and Five Classics, but the test questions are based on the Four Books and Five Classics. The standard of idioms is the most difficult to determine, and what is the benefit of knowing many idioms? Yet, they must test them with idioms and investigate their origins. This is no different from using riddles as gambling tools and comparing them with ancient texts. The test questions are very broad, but the time is deliberately shortened to confound them. Even if mathematics is difficult, there is a question whose answer cannot be fully written on a single piece of paper. There are even laments that they cannot finish the test. These are all irregular examinations. The way of testing should not be deliberately lenient or deliberately strict. It should be based on the academic level that the test takers have studied. If they are tested on middle school subjects, the test questions must be based on the high school textbooks that are generally studied. If they are applying to universities, the test should be based on the academic knowledge that high school students should generally possess. If what is tested is not what has been studied or goes beyond the level that should be possessed, then it is not testing but making things difficult, which is not the original intention of the examination. As for those who use difficult and strange test questions to enhance the reputation of their schools, their views are even more misguided.

It is difficult to choose a school, and it is also difficult to get accepted. However, this is not to excuse students who fail the entrance examinations. If a person is truly determined to learn, they can learn anytime, anywhere, and there will eventually be a day of accomplishment. If they are not determined to learn, even if they enter university and travel across the ocean, it will not be of practical benefit. The story lies in human effort, and learning is valued in self-study. If academic work is not precise and effort is not focused, it is a great mistake to blame heaven and others.

### Germany and Italy Issue Notes to the United States to Close Their Consulates and Withdraw Staff by Mid-July, the Notes List the Crimes of the American Consuls

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th: The German Foreign Ministry yesterday handed a note to the American Chargé d'Affaires in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The note stated that the behavior of the American consulates and the American Express Company in Germany has long been subject to severe criticism. Therefore, the German government has no choice but to request the American government to withdraw all American consular staff and employees in Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the German-occupied parts of France, Yugoslavia, and Greece by July 15 at the latest and to close the consulates. The note also demanded the closure of all American Express Company branches in the aforementioned territories and the withdrawal of their staff because the behavior of the company's staff is harmful to German interests. The note also detailed the illegal activities of the American consulates, listing them as follows: (1) Redick, the American consul in Frankfurt, provided materials for anti-German propaganda speeches in the autumn of 1939 and passed on confidential information on wartime economic issues to a certain party. (2) Nelson, the American Consul-General in Munich, and Consul Bauer, made speeches attacking Germany and the German government and participated in anti-German activities in January 1940. (3) Clifford, the American Consul-General in Cologne, participated in espionage work in the autumn of 1939 and the spring of 1940, and, together with the Luxembourg Consul-General, used the secret code to point out that the German army would attack the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. (4) Kissincha, the American Vice-Consul in Hamburg, participated in espionage work in the spring of 1941, drawing a diagram of the Hamburg railway network's transportation hub and reporting on military construction near Hamburg, and planned to transmit this information. (5) Jacobsen, a former employee of the American Consulate in Oslo, was found in possession of various documents regarding the German occupation of Norway when he traveled from Oslo to Moscow in early December 1940, after being searched at the Norwegian border. It was clearly intended to be used for anti-German propaganda abroad, including a report on the transport of German troops to southern Norway and other German measures. Jacobsen admitted that the documents were obtained from Dr. Nelson, a former employee of the American Consulate in Oslo. (6) American consuls Claus and Hunter hid Sutton, a former employee of the British Consul-General in Paris, in their consulate in the autumn of 1940 for several months. Later, Sutton was arrested outside the consulate. When Sutton was in the American consulate, he engaged in espionage and sabotage against Germany. Sutton has now been sentenced to a long prison term. In addition, the consul assisted a British officer in Paris who had been captured by the German army but escaped at night. Ms. Yangen, an employee of the American consulate, entered the officer's name into financial documents and accepted a paper filled out by the British officer.

Reuters, Rome, 20th: Officials announced that the American consulates in Italy will be closed, and American consuls and employees must leave the country by July 15. A German news agency reported that officials in Rome announced that the Italian Foreign Ministry sent a note to the American Embassy on Thursday, drawing their attention to the behavior and activities of the American consulates in Italy, which have caused serious criticism, and requesting the American government to withdraw its American consular officials and employees stationed in Italy and the occupied territories of Italy by July 15, and to close the consulates. The Italian government also reserves the right to close the American Express Bank in Italy.

US-German Relations Hanging by a Thread

United Press, Washington, 20th: Although the Axis powers' request to close the US embassies in German-occupied territories and Italy in Europe did not reach the State Department until midnight last night, the United States began to express its willingness this morning because the United States has requested Germany to close all its consulates in the United States. It is believed here that the United States' response to the Axis powers will be to require Italy to close all its Italian consulates in the United States. Some of Italy's consulates in the United States have already been ordered to close a few days ago. The United States has a total of one hundred and three consulates in Germany, Italy, and German and Italian-occupied territories, but some of them have both consular and diplomatic functions and may not be affected by the Axis powers' request. If the United States orders Italy to close all its consulates, Italy will be a loser because Italy has forty-nine consulates in the United States, while the United States only has seven consulates in Italy. After the consulates are closed, the diplomatic relations between Germany and the United States will be hanging by a thread because only one embassy will remain on each side. Most international relations experts, given the rapidly developing hostile relations between Germany and the United States, even doubt whether even the minimum diplomatic relations between the two countries can be maintained in the future. Washington and Berlin have not sent ambassadors to each other for two years, and both embassies are held by diplomatic chargés d'affaires. Before demanding that Germany close its consulates, the United States had already expected Germany to retaliate, so Germany's move is not surprising in the United States. Now the diplomatic conflict between the United States and Germany is only a superficial formality, and many people are wondering when the diplomatic rupture between the two countries will occur. According to sources close to the government, President Roosevelt will not take the initiative to break off relations with Germany for two reasons: (1) President Roosevelt hopes that the German leader will break off relations with the United States first, because this German move can make the American people realize that Germany is already at war with the United States, thereby promoting the President's desire to stimulate the public and prepare to take strong steps against Germany. (2) The reason why the President hopes that Germany will break off relations first is that this German move will affect Japan. The reason for this argument is that if Germany takes the initiative to go to war with the United States, Japan may not be bound by its Axis promises and aid Germany. If the United States takes the initiative, Japan will regard the United States as a country attacking its allies.

### American Oil Tycoon Donates Funds to China

### Allied Forces Launch Fierce Attack: Heavy Fighting in the Suburbs of Damascus; Surrender Proposal Rejected by Dentz; British Forces Advance on Beirut Along the Coast

Vichy dispatch from Agence France-Presse on the 20th: British, Indian, and Tegart's forces, having advanced six miles yesterday, stormed into the garden district of the suburbs of Damascus in the afternoon, ending a twelve-day offensive. Official Beirut intelligence acknowledges that Allied forces have stormed into the suburbs of Damascus, stating that heavy fighting is still taking place in the southern suburbs of the city. Yesterday afternoon, the vanguard of the Indian troops entered the al-Ghouta Oasis. Damascus is located in the center of this oasis, which includes a series of consecutive gardens, crisscrossed and separated by irrigation canals and fences. It is said that these obstacles are impeding the advance of the Allied forces.

Reuters dispatch from Cairo on the 20th: A communiqué from the British command in Syria stated that Allied forces have made further progress in the coastal area of Syria between Sidon and Beirut. South of Damascus, Allied forces continue to occupy important positions. In the central area, Allied forces have reoccupied Quneitra. The Vichy troops of the Moghrane brigade are now surrounded.

Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th: A British military spokesperson in Jerusalem stated that Australian cavalry patrols have reached Wadi Shahrur, fifteen miles from Beirut. British forces are continuing to advance on Damascus from the southwest, occupying the highway from Damascus south to Kiswe. British forces north of Damascus are encountering stubborn resistance from artillery. The Vichy forces resisting on the slopes of Jebel Qassioun east of Damascus appear to be faltering. To date, over 1,200 Vichy officers and soldiers have surrendered. General Dentz, the Vichy High Commissioner in Syria, seems determined to hold Damascus. Along the coast, British forces are slowly advancing from Sidon towards Beirut. It is expected that Vichy forces will resist before Beirut. Fighting continues in the vicinity of Damascus, including near the Mezzeh airfield. This shows that General Wilson's proposal, broadcast on the Palestine Broadcasting Service to General Dentz, to allow Vichy forces to withdraw from Damascus to avoid bombardment of the city, has not been accepted. The deadline for this proposal expired on Thursday morning.

### Roosevelt's Envoy Arrives in Cairo Yesterday

### Rumor: Dutch East Indies to Cede 700,000 Acres of Oil Fields to Japan; Oil Fields Located in Borneo; Japan's Rights in the Area Greatly Increased

United Press dispatch from London on the 20th: Reliable sources here claimed yesterday that the Dutch East Indies has agreed to cede 700,000 acres of oil fields to Japan, located in Borneo. This move recognizes that the Manggar peninsula in Borneo is within the sphere of interest of the Borneo Oil Company, which is under Japanese control. The company has obtained oil field concessions in the Sangkulirang area. This move by the Dutch East Indies greatly increases Japan's rights in the area. It is also rumored that Japan will demand similar concessions in the Bandjermasin area and northeastern New Guinea, but the Dutch reserve this right until the Borneo Oil Company has achieved considerable development, and will then reconsider. Observers believe that the Dutch will permit the Borneo concessions and that the breakdown of the Dutch-Japanese negotiations will not affect this. During the Dutch-Japanese negotiations, the Dutch refused to succumb to strong Japanese pressure. For example, it is said that Japan requested that the Dutch sell over 6,000 tons of manganese ore in 1941, but the Dutch were only willing to permit half that amount. It is also learned that the Dutch proposed to sell Japan 15,000 tons of rubber, 150,000 tons of nickel ore, 3,000 tons of tin and tin ore, and vegetable oil this year. During the negotiations, the Dutch also demanded that Japan increase its purchase of Java sugar and provide convenience to Dutch nationals and Dutch businesses in Japan.

Reuters dispatch from Batavia on the 20th: According to an official announcement here, the French shipping company's 9,000-ton ship "Compagnie," en route from Marseille to Saigon, was intercepted last night in the Sunda Strait by a Dutch warship. Because the captain of the ship refused to cooperate, it was escorted to the port of Tjilatjap. One German passenger was detained there and the ship was permitted to continue its voyage.

### US Secretary of the Interior Asks Oil Industry to Cooperate with the Government

Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 20th: Secretary of the Interior Ickes, speaking at an emergency meeting of oil industry officials representing two-thirds of the world's oil production, asked the US oil industry, worth $120 billion, to cooperate with the government to prevent the outflow of necessary oil products that would hinder America's efforts to defend democratic countries. Ickes later told reporters that if there is a need for strict control of oil due to oil shortages, then a system of issuing oil by certificate, used in the eastern United States, is one of the methods we should consider. He believed that not a drop of oil should be transported from the Atlantic coast to certain places. When asked if this included Britain, Ickes replied that what he meant was that it would be shipped out after government investigation, but that the oil needed by Britain comes directly from the producing areas, not from the east coast of the United States.

United Press dispatch from Washington on the 20th: Secretary of the Interior Ickes, at a press conference yesterday, explained the international dispute caused by the recent ban on oil exports from the east coast, saying that the order to ban oil exports was not specifically aimed at Japan, and that Japan's inclusion in this event was purely coincidental. However, Ickes said that he did not know why Japan wanted to obtain gasoline from the east coast, as gasoline is abundant in the Pacific. A reporter asked if it was because Japan wanted to supply gasoline to German submarines. Ickes declined to comment.

### Oxford Confers Honorary Degree on Roosevelt; Grand Ceremony Held

Reuters dispatch from Cambridge, Massachusetts on the 20th: At the Harvard University graduation ceremony, British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Harvard. At the same time, Lord Halifax, in his capacity as honorary chancellor of Oxford University, held a special convocation of Oxford University and conferred the Oxford Doctor of Civil Law degree on President Roosevelt. Due to the complexity of government affairs, the US President was unable to attend in person and sent his aide, Brigadier General Watson, as his representative. Since its establishment, Oxford University has only held a few convocations outside of the university, and it is unprecedented for the honorary chancellor to preside over such a convocation in person. In accordance with Oxford custom, Lord Halifax wore an embroidered gold-trimmed black robe. Forty people from Oxford University attended, including four Oxford representatives. The British ambassador read the diploma and said that President Roosevelt is constantly struggling to seek peace, justice, and freedom. Today, he not only defends freedom with his moving words, but also consistently provides, in a gradually increasing manner, the material assistance needed to finally defeat rebellious aggression. In order to express its deep respect for the President's noble character, the university has conferred this degree to admire his stance on safeguarding freedom, humanity, and law. President Roosevelt's representative, Brigadier General Watson, rose to read the President's statement, which included the aphorism "We are also born to enjoy freedom. We trust in freedom and are willing to fight to maintain freedom. We would rather die standing than live on our knees."

### British Fleet Arrives in Northern Finland; Soviet Union Seriously Watches Germany; Hitler Covets War Resources; Rumored to Have Made Harsh Demands on the Soviet Union

Agence Havas dispatch from Vichy on the 20th: Observers here recently said that major events will occur in Europe in the coming days. However, there are currently two factors influencing the current situation, namely, the Finnish unrest and the signing of the German-Turkish treaty of friendship. Both of these are related to the German-Soviet issue. Finland has long taken military measures. However, according to the British announcement on the 16th of this month, Britain no longer recognizes Finland as a country capable of defending its independence. The British fleet then sailed to the sea near the port of Petsamo in northern Finland, and the situation in Northern Europe became tense due to the sudden arrival of British warships. As for Turkey, which was originally an ally of Britain, it has now concluded a treaty of friendship with Germany. Although Germany has not asked Turkey to allow German troops to pass through its territory when the current European war expands to the Near East, Turkey has assured Germany that it will remain neutral if war occurs outside of Turkish territory. At a time when both Germany and the Soviet Union are taking military action to strengthen defenses along their borders, its significance is naturally very important. However, the rumor that Germany has sent a final ultimatum to Moscow has not been verified.

United Press dispatch from New York on the 20th: Political researchers yesterday carefully examined the rumors circulating in Europe and Asia about the possibility of war between Germany and the Soviet Union and concluded that such speculation must be viewed with considerable reservation. At present, it is impossible to make a firm judgment. Messages circulated in the past week include: (1) London expects that German-Soviet relations may reach a critical point within days after the signing of the German-Turkish treaty; (2) It is reported that residents of Helsinki, Finland, have been evacuated in anticipation of war; (3) Romanian messages slipping through the censorship net claim that the German army is establishing a strong base in Romania, seemingly in preparation for a military solution with the Soviet Union; (4) A report from Ankara, Turkey, states that Germany has concentrated 1.5 million troops on the Soviet border; (5) Unofficial British speculation suggests that while the British Air Force has been heavily bombing various parts of Germany, German planes have not bombed Britain for eight days, seemingly because Germany is concentrating its forces to launch a major offensive against the Soviet Union.

International News Service dispatch from Budapest on the 20th: According to a report from Stockholm today, German leader Hitler sent a personal message to Stalin, inviting the Soviet Union to join the Axis and sign a forty-year economic pact with Germany. Stalin is currently studying Hitler's message, which is very harsh because it would effectively place the entire Soviet Union under Nazi economic control. It is said that Hitler's message pointed out that the Eastern situation should be resolved immediately. The Stockholm message also stated that Hitler suggested that negotiations should begin immediately on the return of Bessarabia and Bukovina. Stalin and his colleagues are currently studying the message and its implications. Hitler suggested that German highways should immediately extend to the grain-producing regions of Ukraine and the Baku oil fields. He also suggested that Germany and the Soviet Union jointly develop all resources in European Russia. It is reported that Hitler further suggested that German factories should be moved to the interior of the Soviet Union, outside the range of British bomber aircraft. He also said that Hitler was willing to supply the Soviet Union with workers, machinery, and capital, with the aim of promoting German-Soviet friendship and peace, and giving the Soviet Union the opportunity to gain the "benefits" of full cooperation with the Axis powers. The most reliable sources in Stockholm claim that Hitler's message was worded sincerely and was not in the nature of an ultimatum. Hitler also supported the Soviet Union's immediate return of Bessarabia and Bukovina, because Hitler pointed out that Romania's grain shortage was due to the annexation of Bessarabia into the Soviet Union.

United Press dispatch from London on the 20th: Reliable British diplomatic sources yesterday obtained intelligence that Germany had sent major "suggestions" or demands to Moscow. However, this intelligence has not been confirmed. These "suggestions" (or even demands) include: (1) A large increase in the supply of Soviet oil and wheat to Germany; (2) Allowing Germany to establish German naval bases in the Soviet Union, including Liepāja, Riga, and Tallinn, especially the establishment of submarine bases and shipyards, because other German Baltic shipyards are too exposed to the British Air Force; (3) The Soviet Union should allow German troops to station land and air bases in Bessarabia to monitor the implementation of the above two requirements. Although these people issued this message, they believe that a German-Soviet war can be avoided. They believe that Stalin will soon make major concessions and conclude a new agreement with Germany. At the same time, reliable sources arriving in London from Norway claim that German troops are using available ships to transport troops along the four coasts of Norway to the vicinity of Kirkenes. This move is a large increase in the number of troops that Germany is concentrating in Norway, similar to the increase in troops in Finland. The purpose of this move is believed to be that once the war begins, German troops will be able to suddenly attack Murmansk and Arkhangelsk.

Soviet Union Engaged in Intense National War Preparations; Moscow Remains Calm on the Surface

United Press dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden on the 20th: Swedish radio commentators and newspapers reported yesterday that the entire Soviet Union is currently engaged in intense war preparations, including the rapid mobilization of millions of Red Army soldiers and the evacuation of women and children from Soviet cities. A Swedish radio station stated that tourists traveling from the Soviet Union to Finland said that in the past few days, the Soviet Union's mobilization of reserve soldiers has become increasingly active. Trains traveling between Helsinki and Leningrad are almost entirely filled with soldiers and transport goods. Swedish newspapers published reports from Moscow saying that millions of Soviet children are being evacuated from the country's large cities. According to intelligence obtained from Helsinki, a British fleet in the Arctic Ocean is currently blockading the port of Petsamo.

Agence Havas dispatch from Moscow on the 19th: The Red Army newspaper "Red Star" reported today that Soviet troops are now practicing shooting in various western military districts and conducting landing exercises in the Odessa area.

Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 20th: It is not known here that Germany has made demands on the Soviet Union. Responsible observers have reason to believe that neither Germany nor Romania has had contact with the Soviet Union. There are currently no signs of a crisis in Moscow. Young men and women throng the streets as usual. If a mobilization order were issued, these people would have already been called up.

Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th: This morning's domestic news broadcasts from Moscow did not mention a word about international tensions or any war preparations. One message stated that with the arrival of summer, the resorts of the Karelian Isthmus on the Soviet-Finnish border have become extremely crowded. The clear weather has attracted many residents of Leningrad and nearby areas to visit the area.

Romania Does Not Forget Recovering Lost Territory; Soviet-Romanian Relations Are Openly Relaxed but Covertly Tense

Agence Havas dispatch from Bucharest on the 19th: Various reports that Romania has sent a final ultimatum to the Soviet Union have recently been denied by responsible parties here and dismissed as unfounded rumors. According to political figures here, Romania has been unwavering in its adherence to this treaty after signing a protocol to join the Axis alliance and will sooner or later be able to have all its territorial demands met with the help of the Axis powers, without necessarily resorting to force immediately. Regarding the current relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union, although the two countries have recently taken some military measures, such as concentrating troops in certain places, mobilizing reserve soldiers, and requisitioning all trains and automobiles for military use, relations between the two countries remain normal. The nightly implementation of blackouts in Romanian cities is mostly due to the tense international situation and cannot be seen as a kind of war action by Romania against the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the Romanian press is extremely calm, and no newspaper has mentioned the relationship between the Soviet Union and Romania.

Rengo News Agency dispatch from Bucharest on the 20th: The Romanian government has requisitioned all grain stores in the country, for a period of one year.

Finland Calls Up Young Men for Enlistment; Implements Measures to Safeguard National Defense

Agence Havas dispatch from Helsinki on the 20th: Government agencies posted a Ministry of the Army notice this morning ordering young men born after 1897 to register with the authorities in preparation for enlistment.

United Press dispatch from Berlin on the 20th: A message from the German government news agency in Helsinki stated that Finland has implemented measures to safeguard national defense and that reserve soldiers have been ordered to undergo special training.

Hitler Is Full of Cunning Plans; Britain Will Surely Be Able to Cope

Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 20th: Today, British Ambassador Lord Halifax said to visiting reporters that waging war against the Soviet Union will put a strain on Germany, as this matter will affect one of its sources of supply. This matter can only be caused by Germany coveting Ukraine's rich wheat fields and the Soviet Union's coal and oil. Lord Halifax said that Hitler's actions on the surface often do not match his preparations. Britain is prepared to cope with whatever actions Hitler takes.

### German-Turkish Friendship Treaty Signed; Soviet Union Shows No Reaction; Turkey Declares It Still Considers Britain an Ally; Widely Believed to Be a Stabilizing Factor in the Near East

Reuters, Moscow, 20th - There has been no reaction here to the signing of the German-Turkish friendship treaty. The Soviet Union and Turkey concluded a non-aggression pact in 1925, maintaining relations between the two countries. This pact was renewed and expanded in 1929, and the exchanged documents between the two governments were published on March 25th of this year.

Reuters, Ankara, 20th - After the signing of the German-Turkish treaty, all parties in Turkey are saying "We Turks will not go to Vienna," and are eager to make clear that Turkey remains a friend and ally of Britain. Given the geographical and military situation, with German troops now near the Turkish border, the conclusion of this new treaty is clearly beneficial to Turkey. Turkey still adheres to a policy of non-belligerence and has no territorial ambitions towards any country, but is only concerned about the possibility of German troops passing through Turkey. This new treaty eliminates the possibility of German troops entering Turkey and blocks Germany's path to the Near East, so it is also valuable to Britain. People are generally surprised as to why Germany is so eager to sign a treaty with Turkey under any terms. Some observers say that Germany has obtained a guarantee that Turkey will remain neutral if Germany attacks the Soviet Union. German newspapers have ignored recent statements by the Soviet official TASS news agency regarding Soviet-German relations, and there are rumors that Hitler will soon demand that the Soviet Union return Bessarabia to Romania and make significant economic concessions. All of this can be seen as evidence that Germany is planning something against the Soviet Union, and Germany's massive concentration of troops on the Soviet border can be explained by the treaty with Turkey. Some say that the German-Turkish treaty may slightly expand German-Turkish trade, but many believe that Turkey will not be able to allow the continuous export of grains that Germany urgently needs, and the signing of the treaty may not dispel suspicions of Germany here. The Turkish people all know the value of German promises and guarantees. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels will certainly use the treaty with Turkey to boast of a diplomatic victory to offset the Axis's setbacks in the United States. However, the explicit statement that Turkey insisted on including in the preamble of the treaty shows that Turkey remains loyal to its alliance with Britain, as Turkey insisted on this statement before signing the treaty.

German and Turkish Heads of State Exchange Telegrams

Reuters, Berlin, 20th - Turkish President İsmet İnönü and Hitler have exchanged telegrams regarding the conclusion of the German-Turkish treaty. According to the Turkish President's telegram published here, "This treaty guarantees genuine friendship between Turkey and Germany. The two countries and peoples have entered an era of mutual trust on this day, and we are determined to maintain it." Hitler replied in a telegram, "I am also convinced that Germany and Turkey have now entered an era of permanent mutual friendship." Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also exchanged telegrams.

Havas, Budapest, 20th - After the signing of the German-Turkish friendship treaty, political figures here have commented that this treaty is very important in the diplomatic war being waged by the Axis powers and the United States and Britain. Since Turkey signed a tripartite mutual assistance treaty with Britain and France in 1939, relations between Germany and Turkey have deteriorated sharply. Therefore, the signing of this friendship treaty can be seen as a stabilizing factor in relations between the two countries.

Mixed Reactions to the Treaty in Germany

Reuters, London, 20th - A Reuters special correspondent reports that the news of the signing of the German-Turkish ten-year friendship treaty was met with shrugs at the London Foreign Embassies. A former ambassador to Britain from a country that has fallen said, "Turkey is almost the only country that has not concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany. All other countries were invaded as soon as the ink on their non-aggression treaties was dry. Is this ten-year friendship treaty a bad omen for Turkey?" This news came unexpectedly, causing displeasure among the British public, but the British Foreign Office had already heard everything. In practical terms, this treaty has both advantages and disadvantages for Germany. One advantage is that Hitler can boast that both conquered and unconquered countries in Europe are now prepared to accept the benefits of the new order. Another is that Turkey can remain neutral in the event of a Soviet-German war. As for the disadvantages, Germany cannot use Turkey as a route to invade the Mosul oilfields or to rescue Syria, and Hitler will find it more difficult to attack Africa. From various phenomena, it seems that Hitler has intentions of attacking the Soviet Union, testing his fate in the place where Napoleon failed. Seizing the supply of oil and grain is truly the shortcut.

Eastern Newspaper's Observation on the Future of Germany and the Soviet Union

Reuters, Tokyo, 10th - The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated today that the German-Turkish agreement seems likely to force the Soviet Union to cooperate with the Nationalist government, even at the expense of its interests in the Near East. Turkey's joining the Axis camp is greatly beneficial to Germany. General Ludendorff once said, "Turkey, standing on the German side in the First European War, enabled Germany to prolong its resistance for two years." Looking at the past, although Turkey wears a mask of neutrality, it is often willing to lean towards the Axis powers, with the Allied powers being secondary. Therefore, the German-Turkish agreement is merely the natural result of Turkey's traditional policy. The new agreement seems likely to make the signatory countries close to each other not only economically but also in other respects, especially because Germany made efforts to assist in the construction of the new Turkey after the First European War.

### Iran Implements Five-Year Plan to Develop Agriculture and Industry

Haitong News Agency, Tehran, 20th - The Iranian government has already passed a five-year plan to develop agriculture and industry. All categories of industry will be under government control.

### Germany and Italy Sign Agreement on Cooperation in Defense Industry; Stipulates Methods of Raw Material Supply; Italy and Turkey Conduct Commercial Treaty Negotiations

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th - Germany and Italy negotiated on the issue of cooperation in the defense industry in Berlin from the 3rd to the 19th of this month. An agreement was signed by Dr. Clodius, Chairman of the German Committee, and Ambassador Giannini, Chairman of the Italian Committee, stipulating a joint plan for the supply of raw materials for Germany and Italy in the second half of 1941. Other economic issues have also been discussed, and special liquidation methods have been agreed upon regarding military payments.

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 20th - Officials here declare that the commercial treaty being negotiated between Italy and Turkey in Ankara is expected to be signed next week.

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 20th - Political observers here believe that the signing of the German-Turkish friendship agreement will definitely benefit Italian-Turkish relations. However, Italy and Turkey will not sign a similar treaty because the Italian-Turkish friendship treaty of 1928 is still valid.

### Hess Receives Prisoner of War Treatment in England; Butler Replies to Members of Parliament; Does Not Wish to Say Much About the Case

Reuters, London, 20th - Foreign Under-Secretary Butler yesterday replied in the House of Commons to questions about the Hess case, who flew to Scotland a month ago, stating that he was unable to fully answer the questions of the members for the sake of public interest. Butler did not depart from the government's current policy of silence on the Hess affair, saying that there was no mystery or worry about the Hess affair. Hess is a prisoner of war, and the British side is treating him as a prisoner of war now and in the future. Regarding the point of whether the Duke of Hamilton knew Hess, or whether Hess had corresponded with the Duke of Hamilton before fleeing to Scotland, Butler said that he had nothing to add to the words issued by Air Minister Sinclair. (Note: Sinclair said on May 22nd that the Duke of Hamilton had never met Hess and did not know him. Also, when Hess flew to Scotland, he parachuted near the Duke of Hamilton's house, claiming that he wanted to meet with the Duke of Hamilton to discuss a peace plan.) Labor MP Silverman interjected, asking whether the British side was treating Hess as a civilian prisoner or as a general. Butler said that Hess was being treated as an officer, entirely according to prisoner of war treatment, fair and without negligence. Speculation about Hess's reasons for coming to England could be left to the members to imagine for themselves. Silverman asked what the Prime Minister had told the US government, and why the US government knew things that the British people could not know. Butler replied that there was nothing that could be told to the US government that could not be told to the British people. However, in wartime, the diplomatic relations between Britain and other countries were endless, and he was sorry that he could not disclose them to Parliament. The British people should share the same goals as the government as much as possible, but regarding this case, we do not believe that speaking about it will increase public efforts, nor do we believe that not speaking about it will undermine public opinion. Butler spoke about the general policy points involved in the debate, saying that the government does not avoid expressing idealistic words that may not be realized in the future. We are currently working hard and are determined to carry this hard work through to the end. We not only want to build a new Britain, but also want to build a new Europe. This is work that we can carry out without having to make grand pronouncements.

### British Newspapers Suggest Reforming Government Agencies

Reuters, London, 20th - Prime Minister Churchill reported in detail on the shipping situation when Eugene held a secret meeting during questioning in the House of Commons yesterday. The "Times" published an article yesterday stating that the Prime Minister is handling too many government affairs and should relinquish his position as a member of the Defense Cabinet, leading a small war cabinet, which would handle major events. Britain now has self-motivated and inspiring figures in the prime minister's office. If he could slightly reduce some of the heavy work he is currently undertaking, then the work he is currently doing would be even more valuable. Churchill's position is unassailable, and no one wants to attack him. The opinions disclosed by the "Times" yesterday are merely one of the ordinary and constructive criticisms that are common in democratic governance and do not contain any other meaning. At the same time, the House of Commons will vote to decide on Britain's war expenses of 1 billion pounds.

### Scottish Highlanders Participate in Defense; Born Brave and Skilled at Shooting; German Invasion Will Surely Meet Misfortune

United Press, Scotland, 20th - At present, Scottish shepherds, gamekeepers, and others are engaged in defending the Scottish highlands to defend against aerial invasion. These people have already constituted the essence of the British domestic defense forces, with more than 1.5 million people. These people are mobilized in the Northern Highlands region, and their strength is equal to one of the largest defense units in the British Isles. Compared with the defense forces in London, the London suburbs, and other densely populated areas, they seem small, but the shooting ability of each of these people, with the people in the Kandaki Mountains, has already become one of the strongest guerrilla teams anywhere in the world. According to officials, they know almost everything that happens or moves in the mountain areas, and none of their shots are fired in vain. However, what has been said above is not exhaustive.

### British Air Force Again Attacks German Industrial Zone; Without Interruption for Nine Consecutive Days

Reuters, London, 20th - Last night, British bombers again flew over western Germany. Since the British Air Force began large-scale bombing of German targets nine days ago, there has not been a single night of interruption. Last night, the main targets of the British aircraft were heavy industries in western Germany, with Cologne and Düsseldorf being particularly heavily bombed. Two British aircraft were lost.

Reuters, London, 20th - The communiqué stated that during the day on Thursday, British bombers, protected by large fighter groups, again attacked northern France and encountered very little resistance from enemy fighters, and destroyed one of them. The Harvard Shipyard was bombed, and the docks and oil storage depots were hit and exploded. British coastal aircraft also attacked near the French coast, hitting and sinking a supply ship escorted by enemy destroyers. No British aircraft were lost.

### War in Europe Discussions (64) The Reality of Britain's Hard Fight

These few articles are communications from the Christian Science Monitor's London correspondent. They are translated and recorded as follows:

This European war has reached a turning point in terms of air warfare. The serious period of the struggle for air supremacy between Britain and Germany has begun. During this period, the strength of the British Air Force has reached its strongest position since the beginning of the war. Not only has the defense against enemy nighttime air raids improved, but it can also take the initiative to invade enemy territory and carry out counterattacks with newer and more powerful aircraft. Unless Germany can perform a surprising victory, the air superiority that Britain has will surely become more and more obvious in the future.

This situation not only reflects the optimistic remarks of the British government, but is also a conclusion reached after careful and objective precision analysis. Since returning from the United States, the reporter has personally visited various places to directly investigate the damage caused by the bombing in Britain and the important significance of air warfare. The reporter has observed the activities of the British Air Force and its recent air defenses, and has discussed various situations with general drivers, staff members, aircraft industry producers, and well-informed neutral observers.

Based on the reporter's on-the-spot investigation, the situation of Britain in the air war was indeed very dangerous in the summer of last year, and it was even more precarious after autumn, and there was no improvement in winter, but today, there has indeed been obvious progress, and the future is becoming brighter.

Regarding the future of the air war, there are currently three main questions: First, what is the actual scope and importance of the damage caused by German aircraft bombing in Britain for six months? Second, what are the hopes for Britain to defend against the continuous and relentless attacks of German bombers? Third, what is the possibility of Britain taking a practical and effective offensive against Germany?

Since returning to London, the reporter has personally inspected and ordered colleagues to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the areas in Britain that have been most severely bombed and destroyed. The places that have been directly investigated include Coventry, Birmingham, Cardiff, Swansea, the London industrial area, the city of London, the East End of London, the dock area, and other places. The reporter often spent the whole day inspecting the bombed areas and towns, and has personally experienced bombing and was forced to leave the apartment, so it can be said that this is talk based on experience.

The urban areas and towns of England, Scotland and Wales, and even the peaceful countryside, have suffered great losses from bombing, of course, but the reality is very strange. No one can stand in the center of Coventry like a reporter without feeling the cruelty of the totalitarian country's behavior and the indiscriminate bombing of German aircraft. Most of the downtown area of London has been turned into scorched earth, and no one can march among its ruins and rubble without feeling the devastation of the German aircraft. The residential areas in the East End of London have now been shaken to the point where the walls have collapsed and the silence is silent. No one can linger there without feeling the inhumanity of the enemy aircraft.

Having said that, the impression left by the reporter after seeing this incalculable loss is not how great the loss suffered by Britain is, but how small it is in reality. Compared with undamaged houses and towns, how small the loss is and how insignificant the loss is in military significance. The loss of British military equipment is actually negligible.

Military equipment of strategic importance, such as airfields, docks, barracks, railways, factories, and gas plants, has of course been hit by bombs, but the damage is mostly light, and even if it is very heavy, it can be quickly repaired. Factories are destroyed, or damaged to the point of being irreparable, and they are actively producing in other buildings in an instant.

The losses suffered by various places due to bombing are also very small compared to the entire area. London is a good example. Of the more than 2 million houses in London, the number that have been destroyed and suffered significant losses, compared to those that have only suffered minor injuries and shattered doors and windows, can be said to be a drop in the bucket. "

Although the statistics of all the damages suffered by London cannot be published, the fact that there are 17,000 soldiers clearing the rubble in the bombed areas and demolishing the houses that are about to collapse can give a general idea. Engineer Colonel Dunnam is still very optimistic about the future. He said that Hitler can never destroy London because London is too big. One can get this impression by simply visiting the city of London and the whole country.

However, this favorable conclusion must assume that a more effective defense can be made against the continuous and active bombing of enemy aircraft—especially nighttime bombing—because no country can withstand such unlimited bombing.

Until now, the resistance of the British people has not wavered in the slightest. It is most noteworthy that the ladies of Britain, even under bombing, still live their lives with infinite courage, calmly and happily.

This excellent national spirit is undoubtedly due to the fact that everyone feels that Britain's defensive and offensive positions are constantly improving. This progress is now going through an important stage. The defense against nighttime bombing has shown significant effects. In the first half of March this year, 43 German bombers were shot down, which is a significant fact.

In the past four or five months, Britain has used various experimental methods to try to solve the problem of nighttime bombing. Judging from the numbers above, it can be seen that it has been very effective.

Recently, German aircraft bombed Glasgow, Bristol, Hull, and London at night, and the disasters in various places were extremely serious, which shows that there are still many things to do to eliminate or reduce the threat of nighttime bombing. However, there are also several points that have already been improved, such as the new Bofors nighttime fighter, the anti-aircraft gun sight, and other secret designs.

There has also been parallel development in the fighters defending against German aircraft bombing during the day. Several new types of Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft have been produced.

The most important thing is that the British Air Force has suitable equipment not only in defense but also in attack, and most of it should be attributed to the United States. American aircraft have begun to fly to England to provide assistance, and the quantity is indeed considerable, and the superior quality is especially noteworthy.

It is not difficult to answer in general terms how good American-made aircraft are. Although American-made fighters have some technical and subtle advantages over British-made fighters, and their actions are more agile, they are obviously insufficient in terms of speed, armor, and weapon configuration compared with British Spitfire or Hurricane fighters.

The new American fighters that have now arrived in Britain, such as the Curtis, have improved on the above-mentioned weaknesses. If this continues to be improved, then American fighters will eventually be able to reach the art of the new Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft after improvement, but it is still far from this step.

The situation with bombers is somewhat the opposite. In the spring and summer of last year, the British Air Force authorities had already seen that there was a possibility of air combat over the British Isles before the beginning of autumn, and it could be known that at least within six or eight months, no assistance could be obtained from the United States, and they had to use the wisest method to solve this problem. This was the fact at the time.

They focused almost all of Britain's production on manufacturing fighters, which are of course defensive weapons. They also ordered long-range bombers from the United States, which belonged to offensive weapons.

The United States has a long history of experimenting with building commercial transport aircraft, and its aviation industry therefore has the best equipment for building long-range, large-sized aircraft. Britain is now able to start receiving this type of aircraft from the United States, and is at a critical moment to change from a defensive to an offensive against Germany.

In fact, British aircraft have been bombing German military targets for several months, but there is still a lack of long-distance heavy bombers that can carry huge amounts of heavy bombs. Therefore, the damage suffered by Germany, except for Bremen, Hamburg, and several ports near the sea, is lighter. The reason for this is that these targets, like the invasion bases on the mainland, are still close to the British bases, so effective bombing can be carried out by twin-engine bombers. Now there are several excellent and fast four-engine bombers flying in from the United States, and Britain itself also has new long-range giant bombers like the Halifax being built, so the strength of the British Air Force's heavy bomber squadron is rapidly increasing.

Britain is indeed more optimistic about the future of the air war than before. The passage of the American Lend-Lease Act and President Roosevelt's recent speech imply that Britain can obtain the aircraft it needs from the United States, not only will it be manufactured in the United States, but it will also be sent to Britain, which has made the future situation even brighter. In addition, the aircraft production in various parts of the British Empire is progressing, and the number of aircraft drivers trained by its training program has also become considerable.

### Chairman Lin and Others Appraise Yang Weiquan's Album of Paintings

The veteran painter Yang Weiquan is a master of both figure and flower paintings, with exquisite skill in both. His masterpiece "Pile of Brocade Ashes" is particularly ingenious. The design of his album of paintings has been in the works for a long time and has recently gone to print. Renowned figures from home and abroad have contributed appraisals. Several excellent pieces by Chairman Lin and the late Duan Qirui are recorded below: "The brush gives life to color, wielding two tubes; With a stroke of the blank, he skillfully creates form. The six methods naturally lead to the eight, Uniquely achieving the essence, surpassing great works." (Lin Sen); "May the Shang bronze tripods be passed down through the years, and the paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties illuminate the eyes with beauty. Do not laugh at the casual strokes of the brush, for the master loves to sleep surrounded by books." (Yu Youren); "Heavenly Wu and Purple Phoenix convey ingenuity; Fortune, prosperity, mandarin ducks gather in the painting. The affairs of the world require your skillful hands; To organize and manage the scattered remnants takes effort." (Huang Yanpei); "Why should I not admire what others discard? Caressing its exquisite beauty, it surpasses the works of nature. Fragments and broken pages are all precious; The painting opens up a style of antiquity." (Duan Qirui); "How different from Qian Shunju, surpassing the 'Pile of Brocade Ashes.' The remnants are still worth picking up; Relying on your clever cutting and tailoring." (Zhang Binglin); "Why boast that hills and valleys can conceal the body? A true likeness is written in the painting of antiquities. Without embroidered robes and armored tents, the fragrance of banquets and the splendor of the Song dynasty naturally give birth to spring." (Xiong Xiling); "Gathering brocades forms a clever loom; The remnants and mouse droppings are all pearls. Empty are the corrections of 'Lu fish' and 'Hai pig'; Who can tell right from wrong in the messy pile?" (Hui Yu)

### Grand Graduation Ceremony at Aurora Women's University

— Zhao Erqian

June is the most active season for schools. School authorities are busy sending off the old and welcoming the new. Graduation ceremonies are being held one after another, and enrollment advertisements are being re-launched. Each school is always exceptionally excited and busy as usual. Aurora Women's Arts and Science College is one of them. The writer drove to Aurora University Women's Arts and Science College yesterday afternoon. As it was still early, I took a tour of the entire school. Although it was a cursory glance, the impression was excellent. Subsequently, under the guidance of a school receptionist, I was able to visit the exhibition of achievements from the upper and lower divisions, including graduation theses from the university division, studies in Chinese classics, English works, educational charts, and physics and chemistry experiments, history and geography achievements, and handicraft works from the middle school division. There were many exquisite and wonderful works. Although there was a dazzling array and beautiful scenes, due to time constraints, I could not view them all. So I went downstairs to attend the graduation ceremony.

Entering the Aurora Auditorium immediately aroused deep feelings. Undoubtedly, it is sublime, magnificent, and brightly lit, no less than a crystal palace. To put it crudely, it resembles the ballroom of the former Paramount. To put it elegantly, it is a substitute for the auditorium of Tsinghua University in Beiping. In this place, sat over a thousand guests and student family members, filled with joyous moods and expectant minds. Suddenly, the doors of the auditorium opened, and the graduates entered in single file. The middle school students wore uniforms, and the university students wore graduation gowns. Black gowns and Taoist robes, ethereal and otherworldly, had much of the demeanor of the Tang and Song dynasties, as if they were about to abandon the mortal world from now on, never to wear cheongsams and bare arms again. Under the guidance of Bishop Hui of Shanghai, after a brief speech by Principal Hu Wenyao, he and Dean Nengli began to confer degrees. A solemn and grand ceremony concluded in cheers and applause. From now on, the country has another Spartan-style female force. They are the female leaders of the new era, specialized talents in education, physics, chemistry, economics, and home economics. They will surely make contributions to society and are definitely not the Hitler-style "good wives and mothers, solely for providing soldiers for the battlefield." (See page eight of "Inside Europe") They are ideal citizens who love truth, cherish freedom, and live in a democratic country.

Although Aurora Women's School is located in the city center of Avenue Joffre, it is surrounded by trees and is relatively far from the road. The sounds of trade and clamor and the noise of vehicles are not heard. Therefore, vulgarity does not injure elegance, and quietness can still be found in the midst of noise. The Tang Dynasty poet wrote, "A winding path leads to a secluded spot; A Zen room amidst deep flowers and trees." This is a truly faithful description of this place. A senior student said to me, "Living here makes us think even more of our classmates in the Southwest and inland areas. There are classrooms there, there are dormitories there, classes are held during air raids, books are read in teahouses, three people wear one piece of clothing, and four people fight for one textbook. Our material enjoyment cannot withstand the spiritual pain, so we study harder and work harder…"

The German philosopher Fichte, after the Franco-Prussian War, loudly appealed and advocated popular education. His famous "Addresses to the German Nation" is not only a masterpiece in the history of education, but also the basis for the revival of Germany. Today, China is riddled with holes and is useless. Its difficult situation truly exceeds that of Prussia by ten thousand times. The literary and philosophical education after the May Fourth Movement, the scientific and engineering education before the Lugou Bridge Incident, and the national defense education during the Sino-Japanese War do not seem to have achieved significant results. However, the nature of education is progressive and optimistic. To create a new China, there is no shortcut. The broad road ahead is to strive for popular education for all.

### Grain: Rice Merchants Wait for Prices to Rise; Government Sales Stand Out with Low Prices

Yesterday morning, Yangmi (foreign rice) sellers still considered continuing to raise prices, and real sales buyers also had a tendency to pursue purchases, making the situation tense. However, sellers held on too tightly, delaying the opening of the market. Unexpectedly, the situation quickly changed. A large batch of government-sold Xiaojiao rice suddenly appeared at low prices, selling for only 104.5 yuan to 104 yuan per dan. As a result, sellers were restrained, and buyers' thoughts turned to a wait-and-see approach, hesitating whether to advance or retreat. With a relaxed path to sell, sales intentions also loosened. The overall market was thwarted, and the situation quickly turned from tight to weak. Prices for all goods showed a downward trend, falling to 103 yuan to 102.5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 117.5 yuan to 117 yuan for No. 2, 103 yuan for No. 1 Siamese, 118.5 yuan for High No. 2, 120 yuan for Secondary No. 2, 103 yuan for Jiafo rice, 103 yuan to 102.5 yuan for Min Dang rice, 120 yuan to 119 yuan for Zhongguan, 118.5 yuan for Xiaojiao Pudong Zhan, 118 yuan to 117.5 yuan for Puxi Zhan, 116.5 yuan for Zhongguan, 110 yuan for Tokyo Jianzhong Secondary, 93 to 94 yuan for No. 1 and 2 Mixed Broken Jian, and 75 to 76 yuan for No. 3 and 4 Broken. Afterwards, the inland rural villagers and local stores became more active, and the market turned stable. The market at the close of trading hovered around these prices, with no further changes. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, the statistics showed a decrease of more than two yuan. The British Hua Company was very weak in the morning, with No. 1 at 144 yuan and Xiaojiao at 144.5 yuan to 143.5 yuan, and forward contracts at 142 yuan. Broken rice was at 112.5 yuan to 113.5 yuan for spot and 108 yuan for futures, with a turnover of about 1,800 tons and about 13,000 bags for spot.

Thick and thin geng (japonica) Guomi (national rice) also turned from a tight situation to a weak one, resulting in an up-and-down pattern, settling into a stalemate. Initially, Yangmi continued to be tight, and people were optimistic. Under the sellers’ holding power in the active sales, fresh high-quality rice from South Port early and late rice once opened at 136.5 yuan, and Zhongguan at 134 yuan. Later, seeing Yangmi turn weak, they also followed suit and depreciated. Only the high-quality goods opened at 135 yuan, and Zhongguan at 133 yuan. The final results were similar to the previous market. However, special fresh original packages had not arrived for a long time, and goods were scarce and expensive, opening at 141 yuan, and the general market opened at 139 yuan. Wuxi original package old geng was not as flexible as early and late rice due to limited goods and limited transactions in the market. Since the self-made opening was at 106 or 107 yuan, there was no rise or fall after that, and it seemed to remain stable.

The route for glutinous rice was not as wide as other goods, so the market was relatively stable. Although Yangmi changed a lot yesterday, this one stood firm. Regardless of national or foreign goods, the selling price remained at the original price. Hong Kong round-grain opened at 118 to 119 yuan, long-grain at 116 to 117 yuan to 115 yuan, Nuo Lu high from 110 yuan, down to 105 to 106 yuan, and Guoyuan Special from 105 to 106 yuan, down to 102 yuan.

A large batch of Yangmi was transshipped to Tianjin. The Yang Company's Rich Sheng Wheel will load more than 20,000 bags of Yangmi to Tianjin today. Part of the Yangmi was loaded by the Rich Sheng Wheel from Hong Kong and shipped directly to Tianjin. Part of it was shipped from Hong Kong by the Yuansheng Wheel and transshipped to the Rich Sheng Wheel at Qichang Warehouse to Tianjin. There are also 4,000 bags of corn, which will be loaded onto the Taikoo Company's Shuntian Wheel today and shipped to Yantai. (Zu)

### Yangfen (Foreign Flour) Surges Then Falls Back Slightly

Yesterday's spot Yangfen market saw a large rise followed by a slight fall. The recent sharp rise in prices had been fully reflected. The period for new wheat to enter the market was near, and international affairs were unpredictable. Overseas sources may not be immediately cut off. Therefore, although people were firm, they did not dare to raise prices further. In addition to the real sales demand from local buyers, profit-taking hoarders were already intending to sell at high prices. Therefore, Jinlong flour opened at a loose 31.3 yuan. However, with slight buyer demand in the middle, the price recovered to 31.65 yuan, slightly more than half a corner higher than the previous day. Paohao flour also rose slightly by half a corner to 32.3 yuan. Shuangying brand also opened at 31.5 yuan. The total turnover was 23,000 to 24,000 bags. The Huachang Pingmai flour maintained as usual. According to the factory, if the previously scheduled Yangmai does not arrive, and new wheat remittances are banned, the Pingmai flour will have to be stopped.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat trading was as stagnant as ever. The new wheat source was banned and there was no hope of smooth passage. The goods thrown in by the Japanese factory had not yet arrived, and the old wheat had already been ordered off the market. During this period of disconnection between the new and old, trading in the market was unanimously suspended. It is said that although new wheat in the inland is surging, the production price is seen to be high, making the trip to Shanghai more disappointing.

### Coarse Grains: Doubing (Bean Cake) Falls Sharply

Since the failure of the bulls, the disastrous fall of the Doubing market has been even more severe. The reason for this is that the gang in charge of exports has been hesitant, and the inland sales market is supplied by the Xichang area, resulting in a failure in real sales. The future market is full of chips, and the bulls cannot raise their heads. Without special stimulation, the general trend cannot reverse the decline. Yesterday's spot Bing (cake) also fell by 3 to 4 corners, and the future Bing fell again by 8 to 9 corners to 1 yuan. The opening price for Feizi Bing was more than 600 pieces, priced at 16.8 yuan, and the opening price for Lu Zi Bing (May next warehouse order) was 500 pieces, at 16.8 yuan. The opening price for Sheng Bing was 1,000 pieces (May next warehouse order), priced at 17.35 yuan. Also, 2,000 pieces for the May next warehouse order, June next delivery, priced at 17.7 yuan, and 5,000 pieces for the June upper warehouse order, June next delivery, priced at 18.2 yuan to 17.6 yuan. Also, 3,000 pieces for the June next warehouse order, July upper delivery, priced at 18 yuan to 17.9 yuan.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Black Market Returns to Calm

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC listed exchanges all level. The black market for British and American exchanges was quite stable. Domestic and foreign rumors subsided. Speculators were overzealous in selling. The numbers were small, however, and the market was dull and flat. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants were slightly more willing to buy, but the Japanese bank Zhengjin and other banks sold off, maintaining stability. The final rate for British currency was 3 shillings 328125 and the rate for American currency was 5.4375 yuan, both level. Trading throughout the day was quiet.

Morning Market Trends Stable and Flat

Since this morning, there has been no expansion or contraction in the silver market for British, American, and Indian currencies. The exchange rate of all countries against Shanghai was down 3 fen for the US dollar, and the rest were unchanged. The central exchange listed exchanges were all level. The early opening price for banks selling spot goods was level. The British exchange was 3 shillings 338125 and the American currency was 5.4375 yuan. After opening, Chinese merchants were very hesitant to move goods and the trend was stable. HSBC's listed price was unchanged. The silver equalization tax was still levied at 24.25%. Speculators sold a small amount of July US currency at 5.46875 yuan, and the 6th-7th month rate was 5.4375 yuan. Foreign banks seeking to operate and manage maintained market stability. The noon closing price was no different from the morning opening price.

Japanese Banks Sell Off

In the afternoon, Chinese merchants were still trying to buy US currency at 5.4375 yuan for June and July, which was about to soften. The Japanese bank Zhengjin and other banks sold off the June rate at 5.4375 yuan and the July rate at 5.46875 yuan, stabilizing the situation. At the 3:30 PM close, the spot exchange rate through the July period for British currency was 3 shillings 328125 and the rate for American currency was 5.4375 yuan, the same as the closing price of the previous day.

The Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Alone

The "Lianchao" (United Banknote) black market was discounted by 5 jiao, to 59.5 yuan.

### Rumors Subside, Gold Market Turns Stable; Spot Goods Squeezed Down by a Small Amount of 30 Yuan

Yesterday's dark market for raw gold suddenly turned stable, because domestic and foreign news and rumors subsided. The foreign exchange also had no changes, resulting in a situation where scattered supply and demand struggled. The situation that day turned from weak to firm. Foreign exchange merchants did some hedging sales, but some hat-grabbing speculators often came to push up the price. Therefore, the price retreated to 6,357 yuan, and then stepped up to 6,385 yuan in the afternoon. The final increase seen was 49. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 20,000 liang. Swapping futures (from June to July) had sellers issuing 512 yuan to buyers. Spot cash was very weak. In the morning, Chida issued a large amount of 10 yuan from Wanfeng, with the price being 260 yuan higher than the term trading price. In the afternoon, Tianyuan first issued 10 liang from Yida, 365 yuan higher, and then issued 30 liang from the jewelry industry, 350 yuan higher, squeezing down a small amount of 30 yuan. The price of jewelry gold remained level.

Futures Market Rise Very Slightly

Since this morning, the opening price for each bar (10 liang) at 9:15 AM was 6,375 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. Xinfeng Yongli sold, down to 6,363 yuan. Gonghe, Defu, and Yuxing Yongxian came in one after another, gradually rising to 6,378 yuan. Xinfengyong, Xiangxingyong, and Yiyuan were sold, and the price was pressured down to 6,357 yuan by retail investors. Renchengyong entered 6-700 liang, and Qingtaiyong and grabbers dragged it in, lifting it to 6,381 yuan. Xiangyuyong, Xinfengyong, Defu, and Yiyuan sold. The noon close was 6,371 yuan. The 2 PM opening price in the afternoon was 6,370 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan. Yiyuan, Shihe, and Xinfengyong sold down to 6,362 yuan. Defu, Qingtaiyong, and Renchengyong came to buy, and the disk saw an increase to 6,385 yuan. Xinfengyong and Yiyuan sold again. The closing price at 3:30 PM was 6,178 yuan, 4 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. The price was 6,404.6 yuan based on the July US currency exchange rate of 5.4375 yuan, with a pressure of 26.6 yuan. There was a difference of 20-10 yuan that day. The selling price of the own-brand gold from cash number was 360 yuan higher than the exchange price of raw gold futures, and the closing price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for the current benchmark gold price.

Jewelry Gold Naturally Unchanged

The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at Dayuan and Tongyou Xintonghang remained at 695 yuan, with a 40 yuan reduction for purchases.

Foreign Currencies Remained Largely Unchanged

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable raw gold market prices. British and American gold pounds also had little ups and downs, and the price of British gold bills remained unchanged, and the market price stood firm. The price of American gold bills once retreated to 2 jiao and 3 fen, and the final closing price was 18.3 yuan, which was the same as the previous day. The trend of Hong Kong bills was stable, and the market price stood firm. Japanese gold bills and Korean bills both trended slightly higher, with the former rising to 1 yuan 8 jiao 6 fen and the latter rising to 1 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen.

### Banks Close Accounts Yesterday; Money Industry Organizes Public List Research Association

Yesterday (20th) was the semi-annual closing date for all banks. All current accounts and savings accounts were settled for interest separately. Due to the war, floating deposits increased, and there was a lot of hot money. The number of live accounts in each bank was high. The internal work of each bank had to be completed by last night.

Also, the British Citibank's national currency savings deposits were originally capped at 19,000. Starting today, the limit will be reduced to 5,000 yuan. Amounts exceeding the limit will not accrue interest. It is reported that all Chinese banks will also implement a current deposit limit system starting today, stipulating a certain amount for depositors, and amounts exceeding the limit will not accrue interest. The limit will be 19,000 or 20,000 yuan, depending on the bank.

The Shanghai Money Industry Association has convened a meeting of representatives from various Huichang money shops to discuss the issue of public lists and to gather the opinions put forward by the shops present. There are four items:

1. Advocate the continued use of the public list reporting form for negotiable instruments exchange, which should be marked with a 'zha zhun' character by each shop and submitted to the money bank.

2. Stipulate the time for collecting bills, restore the public list system, and improve it.

3. Adopt the exchange method of the clearinghouse for negotiable instruments.

4. Extend the exchange time by half an hour, and each shop that receives checks opens a public list.

Because this issue was not studied in detail, it was resolved to organize a public list issue research association, and it was assumed that seven representatives from each shop and two representatives from the money bank would serve as committee members. Proposals from each shop can be submitted in writing to the money bank and forwarded to the association for collective discussion.

### Securities: Northern Banks Heavily Absorb, Domestic Debt Exceeds Expectations

Government Bond Informal Trading: Yesterday's market, although it slightly weakened at one point, remained upward after entering, and the momentum was even stronger than the previous day. With the Northern banks heavily buying in the afternoon, Class C bonds reached 72 yuan, Class B once reached 74 yuan, and Class A reached 81 yuan, with little difference. Class D even saw 69 yuan, and Class E settled outside 70 yuan. Under the circumstances of Northern banks heavily absorbing, the market is of course not easy to see as weak, and there is a possibility of breaking through the highest record of January 21st and 22nd of this year. However, after the close, there were sudden unfounded rumors, which although unbelievable, were enough to hurt the market. Based on the enthusiasm on the trading floor and the absorption situation, it does not seem like it will immediately decline. Yesterday morning, Xinfu, Defu, Yongchang, Yongkang, and Hongda all bought in, but Lianhe Lianyi, Tongkang, Runde, and Xie Kang supplied very actively. Class C bonds rose high and then fell, but the afternoon closing still returned upwards, comparable to the previous day's market and even slightly firmer. In the afternoon, the Northern banks' appetite remained strong, with Xinfu, Defu, Yongchang, Yongkang, and Dechang all buying in. Most of the market power was occupied by the Northern banks. Although Class C bonds opened flat, the trend was to rise step by step, breaking through the 2 yuan mark. Lianhe, Runde, Yitai, Tongshun, and Lu supplied a lot, and there was also an outflow of spot goods, making the situation extremely favorable. Class C and E bonds both maintained high prices at the close. Overall, the result of the day was another increase of 0.3 to 0.6 yuan, with a total transaction volume of approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 50 shares of Dasheng No. 1 Factory were traded at a price of 18 yuan and 7.5 jiao.

### Yarn and Cloth: Blue Phoenix Turns Upward, Double Horse Rise Strong

High Seen at 1523 Yuan

The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend was particularly strong. This is because Double Horse yarn has been in strong demand recently, with Hong Kong banks buying up even more, resulting in tight inventory and bullish sentiment. As for the shorts, due to the lack of factory orders, they have been paying backwardation every day. Seeing that the market cannot fall, their attitude is inevitably discouraged. After the Blue Phoenix label yarn fell sharply some time ago, it has also turned upward. Therefore, general floating shorts painfully covered their positions and will make plans later. However, the international situation is still unfavorable, but raw materials have already started to rise. In the morning, the high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1516 yuan, and the low price was 1500 yuan. In the afternoon, off-market trading initially made 1512 yuan, rising to 1523 yuan, with the final price at 1522.3 yuan. The current yarn price has already broken through the new peak of 1516 yuan, and there may be a sharp jump in the future. Today, 195 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam.

Double Horse opened in the morning with a peaceful market sentiment. The first transaction was usually at 1500 yuan, and soon rose to 1507 yuan. With the news that the price of gold was stable and the demand from Guangdong banks was not weak, shorts covered their positions, rising to 1512 yuan. Profiteers sold off slightly, and then fell back to 1502 yuan. The price fluctuated around 1505-1506 yuan for a long time. Unexpectedly, at 12:30, due to the depletion of inventory, scattered shorts covered their positions, and the price suddenly rose to 1516 yuan, closing back at 1512 yuan. According to statistics, 7850 bales were traded in half a day, including 850 bales bought by Hong Kong banks and 7000 bales traded among local dealers.

Market conditions for Jin Double Horse label yarn: the opening was flat, and then gradually rose, with a firm trend. The July contract rose 8.5 yuan, and the August contract rose 9 yuan.

### American Cotton Arriving in Shanghai, Transportation Will Be Difficult

Mills Eager to Place Orders

The current cotton situation is good, and the price of imported cotton has risen, which has strengthened market sentiment. Due to the development of yarn sales, the price of 20-count raw materials has risen, and mills have begun to resume operations.

Another report: the Shanghai foreign cotton trading market is excited and lively. In addition to various cotton firms purchasing large quantities of Brazilian cotton in recent days, foreign yarn mills have also been particularly eager to place orders. According to reliable sources, the future arrival of American cotton in Shanghai will not only be difficult to transport, with expensive freight, but also the procedures will be quite cumbersome and time-consuming. Therefore, the cotton market is becoming more and more prosperous, without a doubt.

The New York cotton market first fell due to selling pressure, but then rebounded due to buying by New Orleans and buying by the industry. As a result, the closing price was up 16 to 17 points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market first rose due to firm prices in foreign markets, as well as short covering and buying by speculators. Subsequently, it fell due to selling by brokers and profit-taking by bulls. Yesterday's closing price fell by 2 to 3 rupees.

Also, the market is expected to open 2 rupees higher today.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth and Fine Cloth Surge

Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday morning. Although the price of Eastern cloth and yarn has been rising, and the factory's quota is also tight, the spot price of factory cloth is weakly lifted due to the limitations of current sales. As a result, white goods, Chow cloth, twill cloth, and coarse cloth each rose by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan per piece, and some bleached and dyed cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in the streets. Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers traded more than 100 pieces of blue cloth, raw slant cloth, and other goods. Northern brokers from Tianjin traded more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, woolen cloth, serge, and other goods.

### Seafood: Black Moss Continues to Rise

Black moss has remained in short supply recently, so the price continues to rise. New Zealand moss has risen from 96 yuan to 100 yuan, and Longya moss has also risen to 80 yuan. The market looks very lively due to strong demand, and is quite firm.

### Dried Mussels Are Tight

There are not many dried Siamese mussels in stock, and people are already reporting a shortage. Large sizes are 230 yuan, and small sizes are 210 yuan. Domestic Ningbo dried mussels have not yet entered the market, and ghost mussels are also very scarce, selling for 500 yuan. The market is tight overall.

### North-South Goods: Golden Vegetables Slowly Rise

The domestic stock of golden vegetables is becoming scarce day by day, and the market is gradually rising. Top-grade Zhuang vegetables are even rarer, with only 5 pieces left at the merchant's, and the price has been raised by 30 yuan. Gao Xiang Zhuang is also opened at 208 yuan, but ordinary Puer goods are cheaper, opening at 150 yuan, and there have been transactions.

### Vermicelli and Noodles Gradually Loosen

The vermicelli and noodle market has been sluggish recently, with more stock arriving, so the price is gradually loosening. Longkou noodles, which sold for over 255 yuan at the beginning of this month, have now fallen to 215 yuan. Qingdao noodles are only 205 yuan. Those who handled it later have high costs and are all losing money.

### Coal: Charcoal Sales Are Sluggish

The charcoal market has been sluggish in domestic sales recently. Various warehouses in this city have a large stock, and warehouse owners and cargo owners are eager to sell. Under this situation of more supply than demand, it is advisable for buyers to bargain. Yesterday, dealers opened up prices, with Pingmao charcoal at 16 yuan per dan and Huangyan charcoal at 12.6 yuan, self-pickup at the pier, with an additional 0.1 yuan per dan for delivery.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarette Price Increase Intensifies

Match Prices Rise

Cigarettes: The informal trading market has seen an alarming rise, with purchase prices reaching unprecedented highs. Dealers and hoarders, stimulated by the tax increase, and with factories suspending order taking, have become increasingly panicked and are frantically absorbing from the market. Those holding goods are holding on tightly, with few willing to sell, and the spot goods on the market have suddenly become scarce, so prices are soaring. The current market price for 50,000 British American Tobacco cigarettes is 1600 yuan per case, a sharp increase of more than 100 yuan from yesterday. Old Knife cigarettes are 1135 yuan, Pinhai cigarettes are 1010 yuan, Little Fairy cigarettes are 750 yuan, Wuhua cigarettes are 810 yuan, 10 Big Front Gate cigarettes are 440 yuan per 10,000, and 50 are another 480 yuan. 50 Big Fortune cigarettes are 260 yuan per 10,000.

Beautiful brand is 720 yuan, and Phoenix brand is 710 yuan, an increase of more than 50 yuan from before.

### After American Ships Were Requisitioned for Military Transport, Previously Scheduled Voyages Were Cancelled; Shipping Schedules Will Be Reordered After Supplementation and Adjustment; Sino-US Passenger and Cargo Transportation Will Continue as Usual

After the United States President Lines' seven vessels, including the President Coolidge, President Pierce, President Taft, President Cleveland, President Jackson, President Hayes, and President Adams, were requisitioned by the U.S. Maritime Commission for military use, the company had adjusted the schedules of each vessel and even intended to open a bi-weekly service. However, as of yesterday, following the President Coolidge, one of the requisitioned vessels, having sailed to the U.S. the day before to report for duty, the previously scheduled voyages were suddenly completely cancelled, and the names of the vessels were kept secret.

President Pierce Returns to the U.S. on Schedule

Yesterday, the company issued a notice stating, "A passenger liner will sail to the U.S. at the beginning of next month. For inquiries, please contact our company. All previously scheduled voyages for the Pacific and World services have been cancelled. The reordered schedules will be announced in the short term." According to the company's original schedule, the passenger liner sailing to the U.S. should be the President Pierce, which was scheduled to depart Shanghai on July 5th, arrive in Honolulu on July 15th, and arrive in San Francisco on July 22nd. This vessel has also been listed for requisition for military use. Therefore, after sailing to the U.S. at the beginning of next month, it will be converted into a naval auxiliary vessel and will no longer sail to the Far East.

Pacific Line Continues to Operate

It is also learned that in addition to the above-mentioned vessels, the President Jackson and President Taft are also included in the requisitioned passenger vessels. The vessels that will continue to be managed by the company and operate on the Pacific and World services include twelve President-class vessels, including the Taylor, Matson, Grant, Harrison, Dollar, Garfield, Van Buren, Polk, Buchanan, Johnson, Tyler, and Fillmore, as well as many other cargo vessels.

Cargo Transportation Is Not Interrupted

As for the company's cargo transportation, it will continue to make every effort to provide normal service. Although seven vessels have been requisitioned, the company will try to maintain Sino-US traffic and may even use the remaining space on military transport vessels for normal cargo transport. Therefore, the American shipping industry in the Far East will not be affected by the U.S. government's emergency measures. In addition to the United States President Lines, there are also cargo vessels operated by the Fulei Shipping Company, which sail from Shanghai via Japan to Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and the Shanghai-US route operated by the Dalama Shipping Company and Tianxiang Shipping Company, which sails from Shanghai to New York in 34 days.

Four American Ships to Arrive in Shanghai This Month

The Ali Jibo, an American cargo fast ship managed by the Hualun Shipping Company, will arrive in Shanghai this morning from Saint Tu (transliteration) in the U.S. via Honolulu and Osaka. It is carrying a large amount of American goods to meet the needs of Shanghai merchants. The Fred Chou, a Fulei Shipping Company vessel with a deadweight tonnage of over 4,000 tons, will also arrive in Shanghai next Friday from Portland via Japanese ports with cargo. The Hubbard, a cargo vessel of the United States President Lines with a deadweight tonnage of 4,016 tons, will arrive in Shanghai next Thursday from the Panama Canal, Honolulu, Osaka, Yokohama, and Maji (transliteration) with cargo. At the same time, the De Bo, a cargo vessel of the same company with a deadweight tonnage of 3,703 tons, will arrive in Shanghai from Panama, Little Luzon, and Hong Kong with cargo. In the next ten days, there will be a total of four American ships arriving in Shanghai.

### Sailing Boat Crosses the Pacific Ocean, Departed Yesterday Morning

An American expatriate couple, Mr. and Mrs. Xue Fu (formerly the second mate of the President Pierce of the United States President Lines), departed from Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the 164-foot sailing boat "Shan Qiao" to cross the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. According to Mr. Xue Fu, this move is not an adventure. However, the sailing boat they are travelling on was designed by him, weighs 25 tons, and is indeed the smallest sailing vessel in the North Pacific. The hurricane season has now passed. The journey between Shanghai and California is 5,000 miles. If it can sail 100 miles per day, it can reach its destination in 50 days. The ship has previously departed twice, but both times it was unable to complete the voyage due to accidents en route. This time, the ship is equipped with navigational instruments to test the climate. In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Xue Fu, there are two former police officers who served in the Public Concession Police Force, one named Bao You and the other named Hui Ke Dan.

### Rongwu Society to Lecture on Scriptures Tomorrow

It is said that starting from this period, it will be a systematic lecture, which will still start at 3 p.m. old clock, 4 p.m. new clock. Listeners can go there on time.

### Three Ships Returning to Shanghai from Hankou Set Sail in Order

The Dutch vessels S.S. Wilhelmina and S.S. Beatrice, and the Portuguese vessel S.S. Sado, which had been moored in Hankou for three years, were granted permission by the Japanese Navy in mid-March of this year to be released to Shanghai. All three vessels are managed by the Dutch firm Fushun Company. After arriving in port, they were repaired and inspected in dry dock. They have now been completed in order. The Portuguese vessel S.S. Sado departed yesterday at noon for Qinhuangdao to transport coal to Shanghai. The Dutch vessel S.S. Wilhelmina also moved to the Taikoo pontoon on the Bund of the French Concession yesterday and will set sail in the coming days. Another Dutch vessel has also been repaired and is expected to sail in the near future.

### Four Banks Allocate Funds to Develop Rear Industries

For the sake of developing the rear industries, the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have allocated 100 million yuan through joint meetings for lending, and have adopted liaison methods with the Industrial Division of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to handle factory relocation and expansion, and increase equipment loans, warehouse mortgage loans, and small industrial loans. All factories in the free areas of the rear can apply for loans. The amount of the loan is not limited. If necessary, the total amount will be increased, depending on actual needs. Specific lending methods have been formulated and implemented step by step.

### The Number of Strikers in the City Was the Least Yesterday, Less Than 300 People; The Labor Unrest Is Trending Towards Resolution

According to those in charge, the number of striking workers in the city yesterday was the least, less than 300 people. Although the local distribution office of the Commercial Press is still on strike, its general management office has decided to start work next Monday. At the same time, 400 workers at the Mallet Company's Pudong Wharf have unconditionally returned to work after a week-long strike. According to the police's announcement yesterday, another new strike occurred at the Yongfeng (transliteration) silk factory at 1435 Xiaoshadu Road, with only 310 people participating.

### Banks and Money Shops to Close Accounts at the End of June

The semi-annual account closing period for banks and money shops in the Republic of China in the 23rd year is approaching. Banks and money shops have begun to handle interest payments. (1) The savings department is allowed to pay interest on June 20th. (2) The commercial department is allowed to pay interest on June 25th, and the semi-annual settlement is scheduled for July 1st and 2nd. Internally, they will continue to work as usual. Externally, there is a holiday for the semi-annual settlement. During this interest payment and account closing period, all lending businesses will be temporarily suspended. Loans due at the end of June will be fully repaid before June 30th as usual. However, in order to support industry and commerce, banks and money shops will provide accommodations for loans due. The relevant industries and markets have decided to suspend operations for two days during the semi-annual settlement period of banks and money shops, and will resume business transactions at the same time as the banks and money shops on July 3rd (Thursday).

### British Public Bus Company to Increase Prices Again Next Month; Rumor is that Prices Will Increase by 50 Percent; Municipal Council to Hold a Meeting Next Week to Approve; Salary Increase Proposal for Employees Will Also Be Passed

The British-owned China General Omnibus Company in the Public Concession, along with the trolley company, submitted a request to the Municipal Council for approval to increase fares again. The Council studied and discussed this issue at its regular meeting last Thursday. As a result, the Council approved the trolley company to increase fares by 50 percent of the current fare starting from the 28th of this month. The public bus fare increase proposal was temporarily shelved.

Approval Expected at Next Week's Meeting

However, according to sources obtained yesterday, the Council felt that there was still much to consider regarding the public bus fare increase, so it specially instructed the Public Utilities Committee to re-examine it at a meeting the night before. As a result, it was considered that this fare increase "is not inconsistent with the special business charter" and there is no reason not to pass it. Therefore, this original proposal is expected to be formally approved at the Municipal Council's regular meeting next Thursday. The start date is rumored to be July 1st, two days later than the trolley fare increase. The amount of the increase is also said to be 50 percent. The current fare of 0.1 yuan will increase to 0.15 yuan.

Difficult Livelihood, Unbearable Burden

However, citizens generally believe that public transportation should not increase prices unless it is absolutely necessary. Now, these two companies are again using high prices as an excuse to attempt to exploit the interests of the public and obtain more profits, which is regrettable. It is even more incomprehensible that the Municipal Council will approve it. Therefore, we urgently hope that when the Council meets next Thursday, it will decide to oppose the public bus fare increase proposal. We should not be "responsive to every request" and place the interests of the city's people in jeopardy.

Salary Increase Issue Can Also Be Resolved

In addition, the Municipal Council employees' universal salary increase proposal, which was submitted by the Civil Service Commission and submitted to the Council for discussion, but was delayed as a result, was re-discussed by the Civil Service Commission at a meeting this Monday. The results have not been announced. It is believed that it will be approved at the meeting next Thursday. The reason why it was not approved last time was not because the Council took into account the urgent appeals of all sectors of society to avoid further price increases due to increased employee salaries, but rather because the Council itself had financial considerations. It is said that the original proposal submitted by the Civil Service Commission was to increase the employee's cost of living allowance from 150 percent to 180 percent to 200 percent, or increase by 40 percent to 50 percent of the net income (including basic salary, cost of living allowance, and rice subsidy, etc.). Therefore, once it is implemented, the Municipal Council's annual expenditure will greatly increase. However, the general public believes that a universal salary increase for employees directly affects the rise in prices and has consistently opposed it.

### Bankers' Association Reduces Interbank Lending Rates, Eliminates Premium for Exchange Transfers; Various Banks and Money Shops Level Exchange Transfer Needs with the Association; Equalizing Exchange Transfer Interest Eliminates Premium

After the implementation of the new exchange transfer system, the exchange transfer backwardation gradually fell and became equal to the demand deposit interest. Recently, Shanghai's floating funds have become increasingly abundant, and the cash receipts and payments require counting and are not without risk, which is not as convenient as the acceptance and delivery of negotiable instruments. Therefore, recently the exchange transfer negotiable instruments on the market have actually required a premium.

Recently, the Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee, in order to adjust the supply and demand of exchange transfers and demand deposit funds, has stipulated that if various banks and money shops need exchange transfers, they can level them with the Association at any time with demand deposit funds. The interbank exchange transfer deposit interest rate has been reduced to 3 points per thousand yuan per day starting from the 10th. Starting from the 11th, various exchange transfer interest rates will be reduced, including the interest on public single overnight loans, the discount rate for 90-day acceptance bills, and the interbank exchange transfer lending interest, all reduced from 1.5 jiao to 8 fen. As for the interest on borrowing interbank exchange transfers, which was previously 1.2 jiao per thousand yuan per day, it has also been reduced to 8 fen.

Money Industry Market Overnight Lending Rate

Starting from the 10th, it suddenly hung at 3 fen, a decrease of 4 fen from the 9th. Because after the exchange transfer backwardation was eliminated, an exchange transfer premium occurred, which had a significant impact on the market. The purpose of overnight lending rate listing, etc., is to first halve the two deposit interest rates of exchange transfers and demand deposits, and then eliminate the exchange transfer premium, while supplying as much funds as possible to make it permanently level.

### Free Water Supply to Prevent Epidemics; Water Company Has Already Done So; Typhoid Fever is Widely Spread This Year

The Shanghai Water Company, every summer, repeatedly complies with the request of the Sanitary Department of the Municipal Council to provide free water from certain street hydrants for sanitation and prevention of epidemics, which is of great value. It is learned that the company will continue to implement the above-mentioned water supply measures this year as usual. Therefore, the Sanitary Department has been working intensively in the Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road area in recent days. According to the Sanitary Department's past achievements, the above-mentioned epidemic prevention measures have been very effective in curbing epidemics. According to the monthly briefing last month, typhoid fever was more prevalent last month. Based on the records, more cases were discovered than in previous years. This disease occurs more frequently in summer and is highly contagious. Therefore, residents who have not been vaccinated against typhoid fever in the past two years should take this measure as soon as possible for prevention.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Rewards Electric Water Heater, Grants a Patent for Three Years

The Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that the Chisifu-invented Kaesiling electric water heater meets the requirements of the Industrial Technology Promotion Regulations. After examination, it was decided to grant a patent for three years. The reason for its acceptance is as follows: The main part of the water heater is an electric heating coil wrapped in a steel coil. The electric heating coil transfers heat to the coil, and the cold water passes through the coil and becomes hot water. The method of boiling water with electric heating has long been publicly known and used, but the water heater can simultaneously open the tap water faucet and the electrical switch on the tap water pipe, so that cold water passes through the machine and is immediately boiled into hot water and flows out continuously. It is light and practical, and should be granted a new patent for three years in accordance with Articles 1, Paragraph 2 and Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Promotion of Industrial Technology.

### More Than 5,000 Poor People Receive Congee Daily at the Cilian Society

The Shanghai Cilian Relief Association, because the price of rice in the city is soaring and it is not easy for the poor to find food, opened a congee distribution factory in the original location of the Ciyuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road in February. The association originally planned to close the factory after two months, but it was extended due to the increasing number of poor people receiving congee. Since the factory opened, an average of about 2,000 poor people have gone to receive congee every day, but in the past few days, it has suddenly increased to about 5,000 people.

### The Authorities Have Been in Contact Regarding Coal Transport Vessels

According to sources in the coal industry, at the beginning of this month, various coal companies in this city telegraphed to coal-producing areas such as India and Annam to order a huge amount of foreign coal, totaling about 2,500 tons. The agreed price was only about 40 to 50 yuan per ton in national currency. These purchased coal fines are now being loaded onto ships in the producing areas and are on their way to Shanghai. It is expected that they will arrive here by the end of this month at the latest. Currently, coal companies are still continuing to telegraph various coal-producing areas to order large quantities of coal fines, hoping to transport them to Shanghai to adjust the market. Therefore, the entire fuel problem in this city, without the activity of speculative coal merchants in the market, the panic seems to be a thing of the past. The reporter also inquired from various coal industry associations that the rental authorities are currently in contact with various coal companies and shipping companies to increase the frequency of coal-carrying ships. At that time, not only can the water freight be reduced, but also the source of coal fines can be increased in the future.

### The Chinese Health Association's Broadcast Program Today: Ms. Huang Liming Speaks on the Importance of Women's Sports

### The Shanghai Pude Association Holds Free Clinic and Medicine Distribution, Opens July 1st

The Shanghai Pude Association, located at 8 Wenzhou Road at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, in view of the high prices and the difficult lives of the poor, in addition to handling winter relief last year by distributing rice and clothing, and this spring by distributing meal and porridge tickets, the poor people benefited a lot, and the cost was nearly 50,000 yuan. The association's charity work has been very successful. Without the enthusiastic donations from major philanthropists, it would not have been possible to achieve this. Now, in the summer, in view of the suffering of the poor and sick, a free clinic and medicine distribution will be held. The seventh board meeting resolved to open the clinic on July 1st to help the poor and sick. It is reported that the association is currently preparing to ensure that the clinic opens on time.

### Distribution Method of the Chinese Gazette

According to a notice from the Public Works Department, the current method of distributing the Chinese Gazette monthly has been cancelled. In the future, Chinese taxpayers within the concession who wish to obtain this gazette should send a letter to the General Office of this Bureau with their name and address before July 15th. However, the envelope should be marked with the words "Chinese Gazette". In addition, the bureau's Chinese annual report for last year has been compiled and printed. Chinese taxpayers who wish to obtain a copy may send a letter to the General Office of the Bureau for verification and issuance. The envelope should also be marked with the words "Chinese Annual Report".

### The Case of the Assassination of Regiment Commander Xie of the Lone Army Camp: The Interrogation is Clear, Sentencing is Scheduled; Hao Jingcheng Repeatedly Violated Laws and Discipline and Was Detained for More Than a Month; The Case of Premeditated Possession of Murder Weapons and Rebellion is Clear

Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lone Army Camp was suddenly stabbed to death by his subordinates with sharp blades while training soldiers for morning exercises at around 5 AM on April 24th of this year. Regiment Deputy Shangguan Zhibiao was also stabbed five times while trying to save Regiment Commander Xie, but fortunately, the injuries were not fatal and he has recovered. At that time, the police authorities of the Public Concession, together with senior officers of the Lone Army Camp, investigated and detained ten suspected soldiers: Hao Jingcheng, Zhang Guochun, You Yaoliang, Zhang Wenqing, Zhou Shaoshan, Zhang Baosheng, Huang Yunqing, Cao Mingzhong, Zhang Fuzhong, and Jiang Shaoqing. Three sharp knives were found on Hao Jingcheng, Zhang Guochun, and Zhang Wenqing, and an iron bar was found on You Yaoliang. They were taken to the police station and the Special First Court approved their detention. After a long period of investigation, based on the information obtained from each person, they were all suspected of involvement in the assassination of Regiment Commander Xie. Therefore, they were formally prosecuted for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law.

The Case is Serious, Public Attendance is Prohibited

On the 27th of last month, Judge Jiang conducted a special interrogation. Because the case was important, he ordered that public attendance be prohibited. Only witnesses related to the case, Chinese and Western detectives handling the case, and defense lawyers were allowed to enter the court. No one else, including newspaper reporters, was allowed to enter the court. After detailed interrogation, most of the confessions of the defendants were clarified and they were ordered to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing. At 2:30 PM yesterday, the case was continued. Spectators were still prohibited. However, reporters were specially allowed to attend the court. The Lone Army Camp was represented by Regiment Deputy Shangguan Zhibiao, who led witnesses Dang Rongjie, Wang Wenchuan, and Deng Tao to testify. The defendants were assigned lawyers Zhong Weiren and Tang Ying to provide free legal defense.

Regiment Deputy Recovers from Injury, Testifies in Court

First, the prosecutor from the Legal Department of the Public Works Department stated that there were no new developments in the case since the rescheduling. The court then called witness Dang Rongjie to reiterate his previous testimony. According to Dang's testimony, when Regiment Commander Xie was assassinated, I went forward to protect him and saw defendant Zhou Shaoshan punching me in the back. Another defendant, Zhang Guochun, was holding a sharp blade, and I went forward to snatch it, resulting in an injury to my right hand. I also saw Hao Jingcheng, Zhang Guochun, You Yaoliang, and Zhang Wenqing all holding weapons. Zhou Shaoshan denied attacking Shangguan Zhibiao. Then, according to witness Wang Wenchuan's testimony, when I was rescuing Regiment Commander Xie, defendant Zhang Fuzhong was also punching me in the back. At that time, Regiment Commander Xie had already been injured and fell to the ground. Hao Jingcheng's hands and the knife he was holding were covered in blood.

Disorderly Scene, Mistakenly Identifying the Assailant

Zhang Fuzhong admitted to punching Wang Wenchuan, saying that because the scene was disorderly at that time, the regiment commander was injured, and hundreds of people in the team were shouting and surrounding the area. I didn't know who the assailant was, and to save the regiment commander, I mistakenly identified Wang as a bad person and hit him. According to witness Deng Tao, after I joined the Lone Army Camp, I bought a knife and hid it under my bed. However, because Zhang Fuzhong's bed was next to mine, Zhang secretly took the knife without my knowledge until after the regiment commander was assassinated. Zhang Fuzhong admitted that he stole Deng's knife after April 10th and handed it over to Zhou Shaoshan, but Zhou handed it over to Zhang Guochun. I don't know the details. Zhou Shaoshan admitted that Zhang Fuzhong gave him a knife, which was later tricked away by Zhang Guochun.

Repeated Offenses, Held a Grudge After Being Reprimanded

According to Shangguan Zhibiao, Hao Jingcheng was detained for more than a month for writing anonymous letters and damaging the reputation of the regiment commander. Two or three days before Regiment Commander Xie was assassinated, Hao was discovered stealing food from the kitchen and beat up the person in charge when he refused to accept the punishment. As a result, the regiment commander whipped him with a cane. The defendant held a grudge and suddenly launched the assassination. I was rescuing the regiment commander at the time when defendant Zhang Guochun stabbed me with a knife, causing five injuries, which have now healed.

Hao Jingcheng Confesses

That since he joined the Lone Army Camp, he had been subjected to various poor treatments by the regiment commander, including insufficient food and frequent whippings. All the donations from the outside world were not made public. He had written anonymous letters asking the regiment commander to improve the treatment, but the regiment commander not only did not listen, but also detained me for two months, causing extreme anger. That morning, during morning exercises, I was late and the regiment commander severely questioned and punished me with a military stick. I couldn't bear it any longer, so I pulled out the pre-hidden dagger and stabbed him randomly. I don't know how many times I stabbed him. The knife was brought with me when I withdrew from the Four Banks Warehouse.

Zhang Guochun Confesses

That his sharp knife was taken from Zhou Shaoshan. I got it on April 13th. I also got into a fight with the squad leader for secretly eating food and was severely beaten by the regiment commander with a cane. But since I ate military rations, I should be subject to military law, and I had no resentment in my heart. I did not participate in the assassination of the regiment commander. The reason why I had a sharp weapon was because the treatment in the Lone Army Camp was too harsh. I discussed with Zhou Shaoshan, Zhang Baosheng, Zhang Fuzhong, and others to escape privately, fearing that we would be stopped, so we secretly hid sharp weapons on our bodies. At that time, when the regiment commander was assassinated, Regiment Deputy Shangguan came to the rescue. I happened to be carrying a sharp weapon. Because he usually abused the soldiers, most of his subordinates were dissatisfied with the regiment deputy, and in a moment of anger, stabbed him, but had no intention of killing him.

You Yaoliang Confesses

That his iron bar was picked up after the fact. Because after Hao Jingcheng stabbed the regiment commander, there was a sudden disturbance in the regiment. I was afraid that some unscrupulous elements from the outside would rush in, so I went back to my room to get the iron bar for defense.

Zhou Shaoshan Confesses

That there was no prior discussion about killing the regiment commander. I only talked to Zhang Guochun about wanting to escape the barbed wire and leave the Lone Army Camp. Because Zhang Guochun was tall and strong, I gave him a knife to prepare for covering our retreat during the escape.

Zhang Wenqing Confesses

That the knife was given to me by Zhang Guochun at 10:30 the night before, instructing me to assassinate the regiment commander, but I was reluctant. However, forced by Zhang's threat, I pretended to agree. When the regiment commander was assassinated, I did not bring a knife. Afterwards, I was afraid that Zhang Guochun would find out and be unfavorable to me, so I hurried back to my room to get a knife to confuse Zhang's suspicion and protect my own life. Zhang Baosheng, Huang Yunqing, and Cao Mingde all gave vague confessions, saying they were unaware.

Zhang Fuzhong Confesses

That Hao Jingcheng had the intention of assassinating the regiment commander several months ago, but I strongly dissuaded him and advised him not to commit a crime against his superior. I was completely unaware of this incident. When questioned,

Jiang Shaoqing Confesses

That he absolutely does not admit to knowing anything, and said that if he was aware, he would accept the most severe punishment. The court, finding the facts of the case clear, ordered the debate to begin. After mutual debate between the police prosecutor and the lawyers assigned to defend the defendants pro bono, the court declared the debate in the case concluded and scheduled the sentencing. The defendants were taken back into custody.

### The Final Victory of the Democratic Countries is Approaching: Mr. Morley Elaborates on the Situation of the Week

Mr. Morley of the Information Office of the British Embassy broadcasted a weekly current affairs report on XODN radio last night, stating that the most noteworthy news in the past two days is the signing of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty and the tension in German-Soviet relations. Regardless of whether the Soviet Union decides to protect Ukraine and the Caucasus, or whether the Nazis will obtain their demands without bloodshed, Hitler and his party's ambition to invade has been completely exposed.

German-Turkish Friendship is Not Very Reliable

Speaking of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty, although it is something Germany has been thirsting for, are Germany's guarantees reliable? It is certainly well known in Ankara that when the Nazis use Turkey as a military base, Turkey will undoubtedly rise up and resist. Currently, the Nazis are still blocked by Syria on the ground, which is beneficial to the British Empire. The attitude of Soviet Russia is still ambiguous. According to Mr. Morley, the general war situation last week was in favor of Britain. First, we will gradually advance into Syria. Second, the expanded tank patrol area on the Egyptian-Libyan border. Third, the active increase in the strength of the Royal Air Force. The Royal Air Force is active in Abyssinia, Syria, and North Africa, and the Nazi Air Force suffered significant losses last week.

America's Actions are Becoming More and More Obvious

Fourth, the United States' freezing of Axis funds and closing of German consulates and news agencies in the United States is one of the most important measures to combat the Axis powers. This is the first time that the United States has taken action to guarantee Britain's victory. Fifth, we still have the upper hand in the Atlantic war. Another German pocket battleship was sunk by our aerial torpedoes off the coast of Norway. Many German warships were hit and German and Italian ships were sunk in the port of Brest. According to him, the final victory of the democratic countries is getting closer and closer. US Secretary of the Navy Knox said in a broadcast to Canada, "Free people should protect their way of life," which means that we should work hard to eliminate the threat to human freedom, which we have obtained with so much hardship.

Ding Yanyong, Ni Yide, Guan Zilan and other famous artists, together with many modern young Western painters, have put on display more than 130 new works at the Daxin Gallery. Mr. Ding's beautiful colors, careful composition, and strong brushwork vividly express his vibrant life. Mr. Guan Liang's exhibits, although only three pieces, immediately reveal that his painting has reached the stage of pure mastery. Ms. Guan Zilan has long been a famous artist beloved by the world. Her colors are as bright as her personality. Whether it is portraits, landscapes, or flowers and fruits, they are all extremely bright and have a charming magic. Mr. Ni's exhibits are also all works of effort. In short, the only feature of this exhibition is that it is modern and that each artist can do their best to display the strong strength of the Chinese people in the art field. The picture on the left is Mr. Ding Yanyong's work "Fish".

### The Truth About the Streetcar Fire Has Been Found: Celluloid Buttons Caught Fire and Burned; The Owner of the Huaxing Button Factory Was Arrested Yesterday

At about 3 PM on the 19th of last month, a Public Concession Route 16 trackless streetcar was traveling to Carter Road and Shanhaiguan Road when a fire suddenly broke out in the third-class carriage. More than 30 passengers were killed or injured on the spot. After the incident, all sectors of society believed that the streetcar fire was a novelty, so they unanimously criticized it. Now, after investigation by the reporter of the news agency, the police have found out the truth of the case and arrested a major criminal. The details are recorded below.

Strict Investigation

On the afternoon of the incident, streetcar No. 84 on that route was traveling from Caojiadu when it suddenly caught fire in the third-class carriage at Carter Road and Shanhaiguan Road at 3:10 PM. There was a loud bang, and the entire streetcar was engulfed in flames. For a time, male and female passengers had nowhere to escape, resulting in four men and women being burned to death, nine seriously injured, and eighteen slightly injured. The streetcar was completely burned into an iron shell. Afterwards, the Public Concession Police attached great importance to the tragic case and asked experts to study the sudden fire. After carefully inspecting the remains of the streetcar, a sulfurous smell was detected. At first, it was thought that it might have been caused by a sulfur bomb, so the Huishi Police Station was tasked with continuing the investigation to find out the truth.

Smoking Caused the Disaster

Feng Baishun, the Chinese Chief Inspector of the Huishi Police Station, Deputy Chief Huang Fusheng, and Detective Liang Yuliang investigated in all directions, and it was not until a few days ago that the truth was fully understood. The sudden outbreak of the fire was caused by Ni Jikang (28 years old), the owner of the Huaxing Button Factory at No. 143, Lane 87, Connaught Road, who was from Wuxi. The factory usually produces celluloid overcoat buttons. Before the tragedy occurred, Yongyu Zhuang on Jixiang Street in the French Concession asked the factory to customize some overcoat buttons. On that day, Ni bundled the finished buttons into a large package and boarded the streetcar on Connaught Road. He entered the third-class carriage, placed the package at his feet, and smoked a paper cigarette madly.

The Culprit is Arrested

When the streetcar passed the scene of the accident, Ni's cigarette had already been smoked to the butt. At that time, he threw it down casually and leaned against the window to chat idly. He did not know that the sparks had fallen into the package. As a result, the celluloid buttons caught fire and burned suddenly, and the entire streetcar was engulfed in flames. Ni fled in panic. When the streetcar stopped, he was the first to jump down and flee far away without a trace. However, Ni knew that he had caused the disaster, so he hurried home to prepare everything and fled back to his hometown. It was not until a few days ago that he thought that this matter, which was unknown to gods and ghosts, would never be discovered. He returned to Shanghai and went back to the factory. Unexpectedly, the case had been discovered by the police authorities. Chief Inspector Feng and others disguised themselves and guarded the entrance of Ni's factory at 8 AM yesterday. When Ni went out, he was arrested. He is still under investigation and will be sent to court for trial.

### Gambling Dens Reappear in West Shanghai: Four New Gambling Venues Open; The Special Police Department Will Investigate in Detail

The English-language North China Daily News reported that after the gambling dens in the area of roads outside the West Shanghai Concession were banned and closed, four new gambling venues opened last night (the 19th), less than three weeks later. One is in the Argentina nightclub, one is on the old site of Yu Yuan Road, and the other two are on Haig Road and Avenue Haig. The people in the Argentina nightclub openly admitted this morning (the 20th) that they had opened a gambling business last night and stated that they had obtained a permit. As for who gave this permit, it was not clear. Pan Da of the Shanghai West Special Police Department claimed this morning that he had not received a report of the opening of new gambling venues in the West District, but he would not allow gambling dens to exist in the West District. If there were any who opened them, they would be sealed up. It is said that the four newly opened gambling venues have obtained licenses, but Pan Da said that he knew nothing about the licenses. In short, gambling dens and other criminal venues will not be allowed to operate in the West District. A detailed investigation will be conducted into the opening of the four new gambling venues. It is reported that Pan Da ordered all gambling venues in the West District to close their doors at the end of May. As a result, six large gambling venues and fifteen small gambling venues were closed on May 31st. The gambling tables in the French Club and the Italian Club have also been suspended.

### Attempted Kidnapping of Schoolchildren Failed; The Perpetrators Were Convicted

Jin Baohang, a native of Ningbo and an employee of West Point Company on Xichuan Road, lived at No. 54, Sanyuanfang, Xinzha Road. His ten-year-old son, Jin Wuchen, was taken to school by his grandfather, Yu Erkang, at around 8 AM on the 17th of last month. At the intersection of Xinzha Road and Seymour Road, they were suddenly met by kidnappers, who kidnapped Wuchen and tried to escape. The detectives captured kidnapper Yu Xuekui, a native of Jiading, and rescued the hostage. They then captured Pu Jinlin, a local, who confessed that the instigator of the crime was Jin's maternal uncle, Yuan Jinrong. Yuan was also arrested. It was found that Yuan had also delivered threatening letters to Jin Erkang's house, attempting to extort money. He was prosecuted according to law. The Special First Court concluded the interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu announced the verdict in the Second Criminal Court. Yu Xuekui was sentenced to four years in prison for jointly extorting money and kidnapping. Pu Yulin was sentenced to three years and six months in prison. Yuan Jinrong was sentenced to three years in prison for jointly attempting to extort money by intimidation, and was found not guilty of jointly kidnapping. The three threatening letters were confiscated.

### Argument Over a Trivial Matter; Chauffeur Stabbed

Li Yufang, 25, a native of Nantong, has been working as a chauffeur for Wang Jianxun at No. 6, Lane 30, Wuding Road, Public Concession. At 7:30 AM yesterday, Li suddenly had a dispute with a companion, A, over a trivial matter. It started with a quarrel, then escalated into violence. A took advantage of the opportunity to stab Li with a knife, causing Li to be stabbed in the head, once on each hand, and once on the face, for a total of five wounds. He bled profusely and fainted in a pool of blood. After being discovered by the Wang family, a police car was quickly called to send him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The assailant, A, is on the run. Because Li is seriously injured and cannot speak, the assailant's name is still under investigation and pursuit.

### Beware of Thieves

Yesterday afternoon, someone went to a Westerner's house claiming to be instructed by the landlord to apply lacquer to the inside of the windows. The person took the opportunity to steal a watch and leave. Recently, similar incidents have occurred frequently.

The police are investigating and arresting these thieves.

Family

### Divorce

— Wu Dai

Some couples who "finally become family" occasionally have disagreements and conflicts of opinion, and they start talking about divorce, especially some young people who are actually half-baked but consider themselves "modern," and are more likely to suffer from this problem.

Is divorce really a good medicine for treating marital discord? Not necessarily!

Recently, an American survey of women who have been divorced for more than five years regarding their opinions on divorce has yielded some interesting and unexpected findings. Among them, 50% expressed regret for their hasty divorce, believing that if they encountered the same problem again today, they would not divorce their husbands. 34% expressed happiness about the divorce. And 16% have "reunited" with their husbands.

These facts prove that divorce is not a panacea for treating marital diseases.

I am not against the divorce system. For some "hopeless" couples, divorce is indeed as refreshing and necessary as removing a cancerous sore. However, I am against people who treat marriage as a child's play, have no ability to tolerate and adapt in marital life, and treat divorce as a common occurrence.

If you are thinking about divorce, I hope you think calmly about "is it worth doing it this way?"

Marriage

### Two Sexes Life

— Fei

Yun is about to be a bride, and she is filled with joy and vivacity all day long.

Yes, this is a precious period, the so-called "one joy in life," this is the pinnacle of happiness.

She often asks me about many things after marriage, especially about dealing with her husband. Judging from her expression, she seems very eager to research some kind of "husband-taming technique." At the very least, she has considerable plans for her future ideal family.

I sincerely hope that Yun's ideal can be "fulfilled," but I cannot be sure of her ideal, because married life is definitely not as mysterious as imagined in girlhood. On the contrary, it is an extremely ordinary matter. The problem lies in how you make this "ordinary" two-sexes life mysterious and meaningful. The success of marriage lies here, and the failure of marriage also lies here!

For example, Qiong—Yun's lover—has a handsome demeanor, a sharp suit, paired with a bright necktie, speaks so softly, is so humble, and understands every thought of Yun! In the deepest part of her heart, Yun praises him with a sentence: "Qiong is a hero!"

And Yun, who can compare with her beauty? Especially her two loving dimples, which make her worthy of pride!—"An angel," Qiong has publicly praised!

Wait until they get married! Honeymoon! Living together! Or after the "hundredth-day anniversary"! I can guarantee that Qiong is not a hero, and Yun is not an angel!

You will see what a sloppy and rough person Qiong is, unwilling to change his smelly undershirt; when going to the office, he often forgets to bring his watch; you ask him to come back for dinner, but he is always late! Even, he can sit on the toilet for an hour reading the newspaper.

You will also see Yun, not like before, constantly saying "Dear John," wearing a wrinkled cheongsam, with a sallow face, looking rather ugly, what beauty?

Previously, they both wore sunglasses, feeling that the other was an extraordinary person, but now that the shadows are gone, their eyes are particularly bright, seeing nothing but "flaws and shortcomings" in the other—from the South Pole to the North Pole.

So I told Yun:

"Don't overestimate Qiong too much, and don't be too conceited yourself. All ideals above the standard will fall below the standard.

"The two-sexes life is realistic, so no one can deal with the other with 'methods' or 'pretenses'! Don't you see how Western couples are intimately cheesy in the park, but still have big fights at home? The increase in divorce cases in cities is mostly due to wanting to use some 'preconceived plans.'

"I am not advising you to sell yourself and completely become Qiong's accessory, but you have to find ways to learn how to harmonize with everything about Qiong, as a big family is a single unit that cannot accommodate two kinds of cells.

(9) A Strange Peasant

He took down a small leather suitcase stacked on top of the cabinet. By the dim yellow light, he began putting the things he would need for the trip into the suitcase.

For someone who hasn't left home for several years, of course, it can't be done with just a small leather suitcase when leaving; he first had to explain things at home to his uncle, and he also had to say a few words to the nanny who was already preparing to "fly away when well-fed."

"Since you have decided to go back, of course, I can't stop you." He held Little Mei Bao in his arms, looking at the Wang Si couple and said, "But this child is still small, at least until I return from Beijing, there must be someone to take care of her. Can you stay for another month before leaving?"

The more polite the master was, the more embarrassed the nanny felt.

"We'll do as you say, Master!" Wang Si couldn't help but blush and smiled unnaturally.

After the matters at home were arranged properly, the only two difficult problems that remained to be solved before leaving were: first, should he wear short clothes or long clothes, and second, should he cover his face with gauze again? Because he couldn't solve it himself for a while, he specifically went to his uncle and cousin to discuss, and everyone discussed it for two full hours as if they were preparing for some wedding or funeral. Regarding the first question, his uncle thought that although he had been a farmer for four or five years, his actions still seemed very refined, and he was carrying such a new-style leather suitcase, wearing short clothes was indeed a bit inappropriate. Qiu Haitang himself and Wu Da also felt that Old Master Wu was right, so without spending much time hesitating, they unanimously decided that he should wear long clothes. (138)

### Sunshade Eyeglasses with Curtains

— Li Yi

In this season of scorching sun, clusters of black sunshades have hit the market one after another. When you look on the road, there are two black dots here and two black dots there, which is rather amusing. However, abroad, this kind of dark eyewear is no longer fashionable now.

Recently, foreign opticians, with a flight of fancy, have installed a row of curtains on the upper part of the eyeglasses, the function of which is not much different from the bamboo curtains on summer windows. This kind of sunshade eyewear, for shielding sunlight shining down from above, has the same effect as completely black eyewear, but people wearing this kind of curtained eyewear can avoid their vision being affected. The curtains of this kind of eyewear either use a liquid injected into the eyeglasses, or are made of metal threads intertwined.

I really think: Yun and Qiong are two polygonal pebbles, watching how they rub against each other, bother each other, and bump into each other, until they both become smooth stone bullets! At that time, they will know:

True family happiness comes from experience, and ideals cannot be built!

### Road

— Kai Lei

I say we are all travelers carrying heavy baggage.

Ever since our benevolent mother brought us into this world, we have been carrying that baggage. It's just that at that time, our beloved parents held our hands and accompanied us on our journey, so we didn't feel its existence.

But now is now after all. Looking in the imaginary large mirror, I know that my age has indeed reached twenty, and I have even participated in the high school graduation ceremony.

Then, I quietly heard my father's voice: "Child, you choose your own path." I also heard my mother's earnest wish: "From now on, it is your time to walk the road yourself; be careful, child!"

From then on, I realized my own burden.

However, I do not feel the slightest regret for this. I once swore to the stars in a quiet late night. I said that I would replace the guidance of my parents in the past with my own bright, torch-like eyes, and I would also shoulder the baggage on my shoulders with my own twenty years of strength.

Now, finally, many roads are lying in front of me.

I have the pride of my twentieth spring, I have the determination that every young person possesses, and with bright, torch-like eyes and resolute steps, I have embarked on the road that I feel I should take. That is to say, I have chosen my future journey and decided the direction of my future life.

Let those whose scalps have been smoothed by worldliness laugh, let stubborn and simple people criticize, just as a sincere friend wrote in a letter: "I am me, I have confidence, even if the exit of this road is narrow, it doesn't matter. I only choose what is close to my nature to learn and research, I can't control other people's shaking their heads and sarcasm."

For me, I feel that the "road" itself has nothing to do with "wide" or "narrow"; the road is just "road" after all. To reach that beautiful place that is always on my mind, every "road" is actually a shortcut. The difference is that the "road" has its own unique nature, and we must adapt to it, which lies in your own individual interests and endless efforts.

We must kick away the concept of the "width," "narrowness," "smoothness," and "obstruction" of the "road," and use our own personality and combine our efforts to walk the "road," then the light we are looking forward to will approach our eyes day by day!

### Western Film Selections "New Journey to the West"

— Chen Sen

Episode 0 "Sky High Ridge" Three Heroes Gather "Giant Valley" Two Heroines Clash

It is said that in "Flower and Fruit Mountain," "New Water Curtain Cave," there is a "man-demon" called "Tarzan the Ape-Man," born in the "Primeval Era," who once studied under "Fairy Hibiscus," received the "invisibility spell," and cultivated an "invincible" body, comparable to the ancient "Faust," and can "ride the clouds and mist" and "fly" freely. He is usually eager to help others and "impartial." He once became "heroic lovers" with "one hundred robbery heroes" and "Red Flower Knight." The latter is famous for singing the "Red Flower Song," and is also an "unconventional knight."

At the time, there was an "Iron Man" called "Kong Ge Ting" from "Samarang," originally a "barbarian prince," quite with the "courage of a tiger," but not the "demeanor of a celebrity." He was born "head and shoulders above the crowd," a handsome "beautiful boy," and was very popular with women, and formed a "foreign love" with "Snow White" of "San Francisco." This "young lady" was indeed a "golden branch and jade leaf," and had a "nation-toppling" appearance. She could be called a "hero matches beauty," complementing each other, and after "marriage," the couple often lived by the sea and swam, and the harmonious love between them was like a "paradise on earth." Who knew that "Cupid" would play tricks, and suddenly there were "waves in the sea of love," because his wife was robbed by the "romantic robber" "Rouge Tiger" and hidden in the "Charming Cave." The "Iron Man" received the news, and followed her trail to the "tiger's den to snatch back the beauty." But his wife had already "destroyed her integrity and fulfilled her loyalty." In the "light of swords and shadows," the "old maid and the beauty" "returned to the great hatred" at the same time. From then on, the "dream of the rest of the valley" was broken, and they were separated by "heaven and earth," and the "charming bones in the desolate forest" became "lovesickness of red beans." As the saying goes, "the hatred of peach blossoms is continuous," and "casting love" is ultimately vain. The "Iron Man" looked back on the past, and suddenly felt that the "earth" was vast, and he was like a "wanderer at the end of the sea." Moreover, the thoughts of "returning to the raft in the sea of desire" and "taking advantage of his wife's wealth" were all gone, so he shaved his hair and became a monk, calling himself "Flower Monk." From then on, "the sea was wide and the sky was vast," "wealth was floating clouds," he jumped out of the "prison of love," and was not tainted by the "three desires," and lived in seclusion in the "Eden Paradise" of "Morocco" to spend his "angry remaining life."

One day, "Tarzan the Ape-Man" and the "Red Flower Knight" happened to pass by "Sky High Ridge," and met the "Flower Monk." They were all "heroes in troubled times," and could not help but "fall in love at first sight," so they formed a "dragon and tiger situation" and imitated the feat of the "Three Musketeers," traveling through "ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers," westward to "Water and Fire Island," to seek the "Moon Palace Treasure Box" and the rare "ruby." So they rode "iron horses" and set off together. Along the way, they only saw "green mountains and red powder," "peach blossoms and plums fragrant," could not see the end of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," strange birds and "monsters," and the "red apricots on the branches" were like "gold everywhere." Sometimes they "rode the wind and waves" and subdued the "black sea mermaids," and sometimes they "explored ancient tombs," leaving "traces of swords everywhere." At that time, they passed through the "Gate of Beauty," which was the jurisdiction of the "Country of All Fragrances." The queen was called "Camellia Girl," and her land was full of "pearls and shadows," and the people were all "women." At that time, there was a "rouge robber" "One Zhang Qing" who occupied "New Gold Mountain" as a bandit, and her subordinates were generals such as "Black Spider," "Thunder," "Little Overlord," and "Living Yama," all of whom were "leaders of the green forest," known as the "Four Heavenly Kings." Because of coveting the "beautiful mountains and rivers," the "Iron Cavalry of Yu City" roamed around, and the "iron hooves and wolf smoke" rose up. But the king was unwilling to submit, so he supervised the "Flying Cavalry General" and the "Freedom Fighters," and fought a great battle in "Giant Valley." But it could be seen that there was "war music in the battlefield" and "blood staining the mountains and rivers." As a result, "blood was shed in the golden palace" and the "queen died for her country." "One Zhang Qing" became the "king of traitors," and commanded the "Western Front Iron Army." Although he could not "be remembered forever," he was still a "hero of the age!" Who would have thought that "the way of heaven is difficult to tolerate," and the souls of martyrs died in vain, and "Tarzan the Ape-Man" and others were taught by heaven to "kill traitors and avenge," and to become "revolutionary pioneers," showing the "dignity of military training." It is truly said:

The affair of "Western Strange Lust" is long,
The "South Sea Desire Tide" rises sharply;

Chapter 11: Valiant Posture Comes to Fierce Battle

So the bandits really have no movements as the scouts said? Actually, that's not the case. Since the bandits failed to cross the river that day and suffered a defeat, Li Zicheng was furious and said to his subordinates: "Since we entered Shanxi, we have won every battle, but how did we lose to Zhou Yuji? I think that Zhou must also be a person, and he is not born with three heads and six arms. The soldiers and horses in Daizhou will definitely not be as many as in Taiyuan. Taiyuan can be captured, so can Daizhou not be captured?" He was about to attack with all his forces, but his military advisor Niu Jinxing said: "Zhou Yuji is originally a general, in charge of Daizhou and Ningwu, and has a famous name early on. He is not comparable to mediocre generations. Our army was intercepted as soon as we crossed the river, which shows that the defenses there are very strict, not allowing us to cross the river safely. We might as well pretend to stay still on the surface to relax their military hearts. After a few days, we can advance at night and attack them unprepared. I have already found out that the water in Chenjiadu, the upper reaches of the Xiaolong River, is shallow and easy to cross. It is better to send a team of elite troops there to cross secretly and attack from the rear. At the same time, gather ships tightly and cross at night from the lower reaches. Send another branch of troops to pretend to attack in front, so that they do not pay attention to other places and mislead them in many ways." Li Zicheng said happily: "With such an attack, we are not afraid that Zhou Yuji's subordinates will be powerful." So he acted according to Niu Jinxing's plan. That night, Wang Yongtai sat alone in the central army tent, listening to the sound of the sentinel outside, which was very peaceful, but the wild wind was very strong and rustling. By the third watch, he still did not dare to go to bed. Suddenly, he heard the sound of drums on the opposite side of the Xiaolong River, and his heart could not help but be shocked. He thought to himself, are the bandits really coming to attack at night? He couldn't let them cross the river. So he personally went out of the tent and gathered archers to the river to monitor the bandits and prevent them from crossing the river. That night, the moon was dark and the wind was high. Looking at the opposite bank, it was pitch black and there was no fire. The sound of drums was thumping non-stop. Wang Yongtai taught his cavalry to line up in the form of a word-wise snake array, waiting for the fight, but he did not see a single bandit crossing the river. He thought to himself that the bandits must be deliberately using a suspicious soldier's plan and secretly crossing elsewhere? So he ordered people to go to Chenjiadu to inquire about what emergency Xu Jing had. But the scouts did not go far, and Xu Jing had already retreated. (95)

### Vainly Spent Youth

— Paul

The literary film Vainly Spent Youth (Back Street), starring Charles Boyer and Margaret Sullavan, is based on the novel by Fannie Hurst. The background of this film is the United States 50 years ago. The various things at that time are very interesting to look at now.

According to numerical records, in 1890, the entire United States had a population of only 76 million, and the number of cars was only 80 in the country. The two old-fashioned cars used in the film had been advertised for four months before they were found. Much thought was also spent on the costumes of the actresses, because the stockings worn had to be from the 1890s, and there were only 14,000 pairs in the entire United States, so they had to be requested with heavy money. Statistics like these totaled 12,000. Now the final version of the film is scheduled to be shown at the Cathay Theater from the 26th of this month.
