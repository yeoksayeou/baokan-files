### Ambassador Hu Shih Meets with Hull, Exchanges Views on Far Eastern Issues, U.S. Orders Investigation into Sino-British-Soviet War Needs and Will Provide Credit Loans to the Soviet Union

Washington, 19th – Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Hu Shih, visited U.S. Secretary of State Hull today to exchange various views on Far Eastern issues. They also discussed the Eight-Point Declaration by Roosevelt and Churchill, it is said.

Washington, 19th – U.S. Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Hu Shih, delivered a note from the Chinese government to the U.S. government this morning, stating that the Chinese government agrees with the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration. The U.S. government is extremely pleased to learn of this. He also said that China is the first foreign government to express its support for the historic Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration. Hull's attitude during the conversation showed great pleasure at this impulsive move by the Chinese government.

Reuters, New York, 20th – According to a Washington dispatch from Dow Jones News Service, Secretary of State Hull, when entertaining reporters yesterday, mentioned the issue of the U.S. providing credit loans to the Soviet Union. Hull said that the Soviet Union only has four million dollars in cash deposited in the U.S., so it is difficult for the Soviet Union to immediately pay for war equipment worth more than this amount. However, the Soviet Union has stated that all purchases are intended to be paid for. The issue of providing credit loans to the Soviet Union will be decided by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Central Loan Administrator. Although the Soviet Union only has $40 million deposited in the U.S., according to some sources, the supply requested by the Soviet Union is worth more than one hundred million dollars.

Washington, 19th – Two hundred reporters from various countries gathered at the White House today to listen to President Roosevelt's first remarks to reporters after the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. Most of the content of Roosevelt's remarks was not allowed to be published.

United Press, Washington, 20th – President Roosevelt said yesterday after meeting with British and American defense officials that the current position of the United States is the same as during the Civil War. President Roosevelt met with British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook for an hour and a half regarding measures on how the United States can help Britain and the Soviet Union. The President, accompanied by Lord Beaverbrook and Lend-Lease Administrator Harriman, held a second arms conference with Mr. Nattson, Mr. Hieldom, Mr. Forrest, and Mr. Patterson. Forrest and Patterson were the Undersecretaries representing the Navy and Army Departments. President Roosevelt refused to comment on the Far East situation at the press conference. According to the President's remarks to reporters, his meeting with Churchill will increase U.S. aid to democratic countries. If necessary, this aid will be extended to 1943 to contain Nazi aggression. President Roosevelt said that the United States and Britain are currently listing the production needs of the Navy and Army Departments and a list of actual transportation for the summer of next year, urging that the U.S. wartime production be closely linked to the needs of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

The Current Situation is Extremely Serious, the War May Extend to Next Year

Havas, Washington, 20th – President Roosevelt said on a yacht the other day that, in his view, the United States is not closer to war than before, but yesterday, when entertaining reporters at the White House, he said that the American people are currently in a situation almost similar to the Civil War era, and also hinted that the current European war may be extended to the end of next year. Political figures were quite surprised that the President's two statements contradicted each other. It is believed that after his first statement was released, foreign countries thought that the situation had eased, so he corrected it again yesterday. In fact, the main purpose of the President's remarks on the yacht was to explain that although he met with British Prime Minister Churchill at sea this time, this move would not prompt the United States to armed intervention in the current war. The key to whether Italy will be involved in the war is not in any U.S. initiative, but in the future actions of the Axis powers. In short, the President's first statement was to deal with the attacks of domestic isolationists, while the first statement made yesterday was to awaken public opinion to the seriousness of the current situation.

Reuters, Washington, 20th – President Roosevelt said to reporters yesterday that if necessary, the war will continue in 1943, and Britain and the United States will investigate and count the needs and production of that year. When a reporter asked, "Does the Prime Minister believe that Britain can win without U.S. assistance?" The President replied that he thought this question was useless, just like a newspaper headline is good, but has no substance. The President then recited a passage from a biography of Lincoln, which said that in 1862, one year after the start of the American Civil War, President Lincoln said that the country could strategically extricate itself from difficulties, which the people did not know. The war must be carried out with perseverance and struggle, and some people will be injured in the struggle, which the people do not fully understand. A reporter asked, "If the President were to write a headline for this news, what would it be?" The President replied, "I would say 'The President quoted Lincoln's words as an analogy'." The reporter asked, "Is the analogy for the current situation of the country?" The President replied, "Yes." The President said that he and British cabinet member Lord Beaverbrook had instructed the Navy and Army to investigate and estimate the actual production and supply volume for the entire year of 1943 a week ago. If Britain also does this, he will be happy for it. As for the needs of China and the Soviet Union, they may also need to be handled. The United States conducted a similar survey a year ago, and now it needs to be done again, because if necessary, the war will continue in 1943. The President also mentioned the arrangements before the meeting with the British Prime Minister, saying that on the U.S. side, the overall U.S. arrangement was to ensure the safety of Churchill and other entourage members, so everything was kept secret. However, the newspapers must have noticed the appropriate relocation of some important people in Washington and London. It is commendable that the newspapers were able to remain silent during this week of strict secrecy as if implementing a blackout. Even today, the time and place of the meeting are still not convenient to disclose, and the details will have to wait until after the war to be announced.

Reuters, Washington, 20th – British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook will have dinner with President Roosevelt and Hopkins today, presumably to discuss accelerating the shipment of war equipment to Britain and aid to the Soviet Union.

### Two U.S. Warships Visit Australia, Will Sail to Batavia, Duff Cooper Talks About Future Mission, Britain Intends to Discuss Cooperation with Dutch East Indies

Washington, 19th – It is reported that the two U.S. warships that recently visited Australia will sail to Batavia for a short stay. It is also said that the Batavia side has firmly denied the rumors from Japan that the Dutch East Indies is preparing to resume normal business with Japan.

Reuters, New York, 20th – British War Cabinet Representative to the Far East, Duff Cooper, told reporters here yesterday that he intends to visit Batavia soon to discuss cooperation with the Dutch East Indies authorities. He also intends to visit Australia. His mission is twofold: one is to investigate the facts and report to the British government, and the other is to implement the plans entrusted to him. The purpose of his visit to Batavia is to seek a basis for more direct exchange of views. He would like to state here that his mission was decided before the current tense situation in the Far East, and is not directed at Japan. Cooper is scheduled to depart from San Francisco on August 26 and arrive in Singapore on September 2.

Australian Parliament Holds Secret Meeting

Reuters, Canberra, 20th – Australian Prime Minister Menzies said in a speech in the House of Representatives today that Australia recognizes Singapore and Malaya as important outposts. Although Australia loves peace, it will not hesitate to make any sacrifices when necessary. In view of the tension created by Japan in the Far East, he and all cabinet members believe that it is important for Australia to send a representative to London. He does not want to make any remarks that would disrupt peace in the Pacific. However, the so-called encirclement claimed by Japan, if the intention is to create the belief that China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands are currently carrying out military encirclement against Japan, it is obviously not true. What has caused the tension is Japan's actions, not ours. If the tension can be eased, the power is actually in the hands of Japan. He also praised the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting for opening a new era of Anglo-American cooperation, and said that the human rights declaration issued by both sides has a great spiritual impact on both inside and outside Europe. After the speech, Parliament held a secret meeting that lasted six hours before adjourning. The government and the Labor Party are scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss Menzies' trip to London. It is generally expected that the Labor Party will likely not agree.

### Scott Advocates Complete Participation in the War

Reuters, London, 30th – Scott, liaison officer for the Committee to Defend America, recently telegraphed the committee in New York from London, advocating abandoning the slogans of "Defending America" and "Aiding Britain," and adopting a policy of complete participation in the war, joining Britain to defeat Nazism. The telegram said, "Our procedure advocates complete participation in the war so that we can win and create peace. If we are willing to contribute to the victory at any cost, we will have the right to speak when establishing world justice."

### This Newspaper's Student Aid Campaign - Acknowledging Support from All Sectors While Encouraging Students -

The establishment of this newspaper's student aid fund truly began on the thirteenth of last month, lasting a total of thirty-eight days until yesterday, the date of approval for all slots. During this extremely short period, we were honored to receive warm sympathy from readers, some donating funds, others giving advice. Over 54,000 yuan was collected, with over 2,000 students from various schools requesting application forms, 856 officially applying, and 347 actually receiving assistance. Colleagues at this newspaper were divided to handle visits and reviews, with the final decision entrusted to a specially established committee. As the semester begins, we are delighted to see the selected students fulfill their desire to learn. Like planting a tree, this is its foundation. In addition to running around, the colleagues at this newspaper feel excited, forgetting their hard work, and wish to express their thoughts and encourage the students.

From the highest essence of education, what is education? It is the transmission and creation of a nation's life experiences. Therefore, education is one of the most fundamental construction works of a country and society. All citizens have the right to enjoy education, and the state should also make it the duty of the people to receive education. Our country has advocated universal education for decades, but has not yet achieved remarkable results, limited by financial resources and geographical location. However, from the social aspect, the function of assistance and promotion has not been fully realized. The youth of today are members of the future society. Will they become useful talents to benefit the people, or will their lack of education prevent them from contributing to the public? This depends on the education they receive at this time. In these times of rapid change and difficult livelihoods, poor students are limited by financial and environmental constraints and cannot universally fulfill their desire to study. If we serve society, we should cultivate excellent members for society. If we allow poor students to waste their time and do not give them opportunities for further study, it is an irreparable loss to society. How can we remain indifferent at every thought!

In the past year, this newspaper has repeatedly received letters from poor students, stating their difficult circumstances and their sincere desire to learn. The attached academic records are also impressive, ranging from elementary school and middle school to vocational schools and universities. Some have studied for several years and are about to fall short. This newspaper has always taken serving society and promoting culture as its mission. Whenever public welfare is involved, it is always willing to contribute, never lagging behind. Now that it sympathizes with the plight of out-of-school youth, it has to make a sincere appeal to its broad readership, appealing to society with the most urgent social issues and seeking ways to solve them together.

The society's strong sympathy, encouragement, and supervision truly inspire and excite our colleagues and prevent them from stopping themselves. Since the start of the student aid fund, readers have enthusiastically donated, reaching all levels of society. Business leaders and members of the banking industry have contributed large amounts, which is of course the case, but shop apprentices, booksellers, newspaper vendors, and servants also raced to contribute their hard-earned money to fulfill this thought of "it is most joyful to do good." Eventually, they moved monks and nuns, who generously donated their income from chanting scriptures to help students. Even saving on transportation and cigarettes, and innocent children giving all they had to engage in this, it happened every day. Most worthy of cherishing is an anonymous old man who donated a large sum of money, admitting that he is close to sixty years old, in his twilight years, with a small business and weak ability, willing to contribute his meager strength as a small contribution. If he is still alive next semester and his business does not change suddenly, he will continue to help. Our colleagues were deeply admired when they met the old man. We believe that this kind of sincere and great act of righteousness is enough to represent the noblest sense of justice in society. With this thought, what cannot be done? We have also deeply realized that there is an infinite sense of sympathy latent among the broad masses of society. If it can be well advocated and promoted, it can be enthusiastically promoted and jointly achieve a valuable cause. Now, this broad sympathy has been jointly obtained by this newspaper and its readers.

Our colleagues are aware of their heavy responsibilities and have been entrusted with the work of investigation. They have asked questions in detail and strived to make the reports accurate, so that the money donated by enthusiastic readers is not wasted in the slightest, and that poor students with a desire to learn, who have excellent grades and pure conduct, must be able to gain practical benefits. With this belief, we have worked hard from beginning to end and have never dared to change. As for the family circumstances of the applying students, we have also been entrusted with sincerity and told frankly. Summarizing what has been said, there are several points: Some students have families that used to be very well-off, but have suddenly become impoverished due to relocation and exile. Those who rely on salaries for courage, or because they have lost their shelter, cannot make ends meet. Or if their fathers and brothers are serving far away, their meager income is difficult to maintain the livelihood of individuals, let alone provide for their children's education? As for widows and orphans, suffering from poverty and hardship, they are in a tragic situation. All these things that our colleagues have heard and seen have touched us in many ways, and we recognize that student aid cannot be delayed.

The review seeks to achieve an even development of academics and conduct. The occupations of the applicants' fathers and brothers and the number of people in the whole family cannot be ignored. As the cost of living is getting higher and higher, eight people in a family, four of whom are studying, the total amount of income and the proportion of expenditure should be carefully studied. Our colleagues studied each case and reviewed it again and again, striving to have no doubts before signing the final opinion. The gentlemen on the committee are all well-known figures in the education field. They asked about the work of each group with great concern and did not tire of being thorough. They approved applications from students who could be given the opportunity. Their enthusiasm was the same as the goodwill of the readers of this newspaper who donated. The committee held three meetings one after another, and the gentlemen came to a stop in the hot summer and lasted for a long time. Their enthusiasm and perseverance are extremely admirable, and this is what this newspaper and its readers should solemnly thank them for.

There is also an announcement for the selected students. Student aid is not a relief effort. The gathering of student aid funds is based on compassion and has the value of encouraging and cultivating talents for society. The selected students, who receive this assistance, should not regard it as relieving temporary economic difficulties, but as an honor, like a school's honorary scholarship. The most valuable experiences in our lives are nothing more than helping others, helping ourselves, and helping others. Now that the students have received help from others, they should strive to cultivate their moral character and study hard, strive to move forward and seek ways to help themselves. When they have sufficient self-help ability, they should help others. The students who receive help from society today will repay society a hundredfold in the future. We hope that this newspaper's student aid fund will be the beginning, and that there will be hundreds of student aid funds to follow. Students, work hard!

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 20th – The Japanese government spokesman said at the information conference yesterday, regarding the close cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, that the Japanese government is closely watching its development and taking a wait-and-see attitude. Regarding the question of whether Anglo-American-Soviet cooperation violates the Japanese-Soviet agreement, the spokesman replied that this remains to be proven. However, the shipment of U.S. military supplies to Vladivostok is of great concern to Japan. But the claim that U.S. bombers have arrived in Kamchatka has not yet been confirmed, it is said.

United Press, Chongqing, 20th – Chinese sources reported today that Japan will soon have 400,000 troops ready to strike Siberia. The Japanese army is preparing to attack Chita.

### Memories of Rabindranath Tagore's Visit to India's Poet Saint (V)

— Xu Baoqian

Appendix (An Account of Tagore's Travels in China and Russia)

In 1924, Tagore visited China at the invitation of Chinese friends. On April 12, Tagore gave a speech to student groups in Shanghai, saying, "More than a thousand years ago, India sent her friendly envoys to China. Although this exchange was later interrupted, we were able to find some traces. I hope that China and India can restore this glorious friendship."

On April 23, Tagore arrived in Beijing. Jiang Menglin and the American Ms. Li Jiabai, among others, welcomed him at the station. On the 28th, Tagore gave a speech to more than a thousand students at the Temple of Earth. In early May, he gave a speech at Tsinghua University.

He said, "We should celebrate ourselves for being born in this great era. You Chinese youth should first recognize your own culture. Some say that Chinese culture is realistic and materialistic. I don't believe this. Your inherent social organization expresses a selfless spirit everywhere. Your nation does not worship money, nor does it worship force. I don't believe your culture is materialistic. I have traveled all over China and seen that the land is cultivated very well, and all the daily utensils express the beauty of art; these all express spiritual culture. I think you can manage material things without being burdened by them, which is your greatness. From your inherent civilization, it is not difficult to see the difference between material civilization and spiritual civilization. Now the cultural mainstream of the East and West are about to converge, and you should hurry up and make your contributions."

Tagore's speech caused praise from Chinese and foreign people at that time. Among them, the most skillful was Professor Wang Kunshan of Tsinghua University, who said: "Tagore is indeed an Eastern prophet. Their speeches come from a mysterious consciousness, which seems to be impeccable. However, after careful analysis, we feel that what he wants to answer is a very practical question, that is: What kind of contribution does Chinese culture have? Tagore said: Chinese culture expresses beauty and spirit everywhere, so it is not materialistic. But we want to ask, is it not so for other nations? Is this the only contribution of Chinese culture? Tagore thinks that Chinese culture has already overcome the contradiction between completeness and progress. Yes, we are also willing to think so, but we can only hope to think so."

On May 25, Shang Wuxiantang and Li Jiabai held a farewell party for Tagore. At the banquet, Tagore explained his religious beliefs as follows: "After I arrived in China, someone asked me if I believed in God. I find it difficult to answer this question. However, since the world is so beautiful, I can't believe that it is a mechanical product. Flowers, trees, and birds all have a lively mission for me. Although we cannot know what will happen after death, I feel and firmly believe that there is a great and compassionate spirit in the universe. As for what we call this great spirit, that is a secondary question." Tagore also said: He is not very interested in the creeds and rituals of various religions. His own family has been engaged in the reform of Hinduism. However, his own religious views come entirely from the aesthetic sense given by nature. Behind the beauty of nature, he discovered the existence of the great spirit.

Since Tagore shouldered the mission of international culture, he naturally wanted to go and see the new experiment in Soviet Russia. In 1926, the Soviet government officially invited Tagore. Tagore traveled to Vienna, but returned midway due to illness. Later, Tagore went to Canada to give speeches. He originally planned to take the Siberian Railway to Russia when he returned to China from Canada in 1929, but he stopped again due to illness.

After 1930, Tagore's long-cherished wish was finally realized. He arrived in Moscow on September 11. Among those who came to welcome him at the station were several important figures in the Soviet literary and cultural circles. Tagore stayed in Moscow for two weeks. In addition to talking with literary and artistic circles, he paid special attention to the Communist Youth League, peasant clubs, and university student groups. In addition, Tagore also held a personal painting exhibition.

Tagore's purpose in entering Russia was explained at the first reception: My purpose is to come to your country to learn about your experience in dealing with world cultural issues. Modern culture has made mankind violate nature and increased human suffering infinitely. Now you are solving human cultural problems on a large scale. History will have its own conclusions about its success or failure. I don't want to make unreasonable criticisms here. However, your courage is admirable. My educational ideal is to create free personalities and develop human creativity. I believe your ideals are the same as mine.

On September 17, Tagore held a personal painting exhibition, which was greatly praised by Soviet artists. According to Tagore, he is not a painter, and his paintings come from momentary impulses. However, according to the appreciation of Soviet artists, Tagore's paintings have become a style of their own, lively and powerful, opening a new era for the art world.

On September 24, the eve of Tagore's departure from Russia, Tagore delivered a farewell speech at the Trade Union Confederation: "The lives, education, economy, and sanitation of the Indian people are all very backward, and there are often military dramas between various religions. Because of this, although I am old, I still do not spare any effort to come to your country to visit. During my stay, I saw your various great undertakings and felt very admired. Your progress can be said to be a miracle."

On September 25, before leaving, Tagore told a reporter from Pravda: "Your efforts are commendable. However, I dare not agree with your policy of excluding dissidents. Because your ultimate goal is also to seek happiness for all mankind, but the opinions of all mankind can never be the same. It must be known that grievances should be resolved rather than tied. If you hate the other party today, the other party will take the opportunity to retaliate tomorrow and make you collapse." (End)

### Fierce Fighting Is Underway on the Entire Line from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea

Southern Red Army Retreats to the East Bank of the Dnieper River; German Army Establishes New War Zone North of Kiev

Reuters, London, 20th: Fierce fighting is reported in the Novgorod and Gomel areas, indicating that the Germans are continuing to exert significant pressure on Leningrad and have established a new war zone north of Kiev. The above two areas were initially mentioned in today's bulletin from the Soviet Information Bureau. Added to the information that the Soviet army is currently engaged in fierce rear-guard battles in Ukraine, it can be seen that major battles are underway on the entire line from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. Reuters, London, 20th: German forces in the south are attempting to break through the Soviet defenses of Odessa, a major port on the Black Sea. Fierce fighting continued yesterday. In the north, German pressure on the Soviet forces under General Voroshilov seems to have intensified. The Soviet army is resisting strongly in Kingisepp (70 miles southwest of Leningrad) and Novgorod (100 miles southeast of Leningrad). Other features of the war in Soviet territory yesterday were that there was also fighting in the Gomel area of Belarus (175 miles southwest of Smolensk) and Soviet bombers sank two transport ships in the Black Sea. A Soviet communiqué announced that on Sunday night, Soviet bombers again bombed Ploesti, an important oil-producing city north of the Romanian capital, while the German side reiterated that the German army's aim was not to occupy more land but to annihilate the Red Army. According to recent news from Ukraine, the Soviet forces led by General Budenny have retreated across the Dnieper. The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following communiqué at midnight yesterday: "On August 19, the Soviet army engaged the enemy along the entire line. The fighting was fierce in Kingisepp, Novgorod, Gomel, and Odessa. According to current information received, in an air battle on August 17, 28 German aircraft were shot down. On the 17th, Soviet aircraft raided Ploesti at night, and explosions and fires broke out immediately. On the 18th, 30 German aircraft were shot down in an air battle. The Soviets lost 12 aircraft. The Soviet army sank two enemy transport ships in the Black Sea, and another was hit and caught fire."

The Germans Have Demonstrated River-Crossing Skills; The Soviet Army's Decision to Breach the Dam Is Hardly a Good Strategy

Reuters, Moscow, 20th: German pressure in the Ukrainian region and the northwest continues to be fierce. After the Soviets acknowledged the loss of Nikolaev and Krivoy Rog yesterday, there is no sign of progress in the fighting in this area. Judging from the current situation, the German army is now trying to ravage the entire industrial area within the Dnieper River Bay. In the next few days, it will be possible to see whether the Soviet army decides to defend this industrial area or prepares to defend the east bank of the Dnieper River, which is one and a half miles wide, with trenches. The German army's skills in crossing large rivers were demonstrated in France, so the Soviet army may not consider retreating to the east of the Dnieper River as the best option, or they may prefer to fight bravely before abandoning valuable industrial areas. A peculiar point in the Dnieper River battle is the famous Dnieper River Dam, which was created by the Soviet government at the cost of huge manpower and financial resources. If there is no impregnable defense, the German army may use this dam to cross the river. If the Soviets destroy this dam, the water level in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River will be reduced, which is especially dangerous. This is perhaps a difficult matter for the Soviets to decide.

German Forces Advance on Three Routes on the Northern Front to Encircle Leningrad

In the past few days, the German army has again put pressure on Leningrad, apparently intending to encircle the city on three or four routes. Some days ago, the German army reached the southern shore of Lake Ilmen. Their purpose is either to directly attack Leningrad to the north or to advance east to cut off the railway between Leningrad and Moscow. The situation in that area is currently unclear. The German army, which attacked the Pskov area several weeks ago, has abandoned its plan to directly attack Leningrad and turned east to attack Lake Ilmen. As for the task of directly attacking Leningrad, it is entrusted to the German army from Estonia. The road that the German army must have taken is the road that General Yudenich was defeated by the Red Army and the revolutionary workers of Leningrad in 1920. The defense of Leningrad is what every Soviet person aspires to. The area has important industrial resources, and the defense must be extremely strong, so it is expected that the great city will now demonstrate its heroic spirit and will to win, just as it did in the early days of the revolution. In addition, there has been an army from Finland advancing on Leningrad, but it has not yet succeeded, because the situation is favorable for the Soviet army to defend, and many Finnish soldiers are unwilling to serve for the German side. Another noteworthy development is that there are many Soviet troops trapped in various places on the northern and southern fronts, such as the Odessa area and within Estonia. In particular, several Soviet naval bases are still fighting to the end, such as the Soviet naval base on Hanko Island in the Netherlands, which is still in the hands of the Soviet army, causing major obstacles to German navigation in the Baltic Sea. Now that the German army is forced to fight in the winter, the activities of the Soviet army trapped in these places will become more important.

Soviets Resolve to Fully Defend the Capital; Fresh Troops Are Steadily Deployed to the Front Lines

TASS, Moscow, 20th: On the 17th, 15,000 workers in Moscow convened a conference to defend the capital. Pruning, Chairman of the Moscow City Executive Committee, delivered the opening speech. He said that the German air raids have not disrupted the daily work of the people of Moscow. The conference also issued a declaration to all the people of Moscow, stating, "We are facing a long and fierce struggle, which requires great sacrifice and endurance. People of the capital, you should stand ready and step up your work, turning every house and factory into an impregnable fortress." TASS, Moscow, 20th: The famous Soviet writer Pavlovrenko recently published an article in "Red Star" describing the situation of the Soviet Union actively training reserve forces. The article said, "Not far from the front line, large numbers of reserve personnel are arriving in teams every day, and the training camp is full of vitality. When a batch of teams are trained and leave the camp, they are immediately replenished by reserve teams coming from thousands of miles away. The training of tank crew members is particularly active. After familiarizing themselves with driving skills, they immediately set off for the front lines. Most of them are tractor drivers, car drivers, and other specialists, many of whom have participated in the battles of Lake Khasan and Mengnaxin."

### Soviet Air Force Night Raids Berlin

Reuters, Moscow, 20th: The Moscow Radio announced that on Monday, Soviet planes raided the Berlin area, dropping incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs, hitting military and industrial targets in Berlin, causing immediate fires and explosions.

Havas, Switzerland, 19th: "The Swiss Daily News" recently carried a Berlin dispatch stating that a confidant of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has been ordered to go to Turkey to warn the Turkish government about the United States' preparations to invade Iran and the Caucasus. This statement has been denied by a spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry.

Reuters, Ottawa, 20th: While in Britain, Canadian Prime Minister King will hold meetings with British Prime Minister Churchill, other cabinet members, and Canadian military personnel. He will be busy visiting the leaders of the Allied governments in London and inspecting the Canadian army, navy, and air force. According to an official announcement issued here, King's stay in Britain will be indefinite and may require him to be away from Canada for several weeks. King's trip was planned to happen sooner, but it was delayed until now because he participated in the planning of the Roach meeting.

### Border Demarcation Between Mongolia and Manchuria Is Completed

### American Writer Hemingway and Wife's Tour of the Mountain Defense Line (3)

We walked uphill for another five hours, and then the downstream journey came to an end. It had been twenty-four hours since we left the Longguang Inn, and the rain had not stopped. Before leaving, it was still two days away from Qian. There is no Maginot Line or Mannerheim Line in China. There are continuous mountains here. Using high mountains as a screen, machine guns can be used for defense, without the need to set up heavy artillery.

A rapid offensive is impossible here because mechanized units cannot be used in the narrow mountain paths. However, the Japanese army can use airplanes, while the Chinese side lacks them. In the mountains, when you look at the front line situation, it is just a mountain, majestic and silent, towering under the sky.

The size of this war zone is like Belgium, with a population of about 30 million. There are two armies stationed here, totaling about 150,000 men. The communication between the front line and the headquarters relies entirely on military telephones, which are always a day's journey away.

Arduous and Extraordinary

Chinese soldiers cannot ask for leave because there is only one 500-mile-long railway line here, and there is a shortage of gasoline for cars. Even if the soldiers want to go home, there is no way to do so. Therefore, some troops have been stationed here for as long as two years, and the troops must train for their own lives. Each unit has a parade ground, a sports field, classrooms, reading rooms, and barracks. Headquarters and officer training camps are often located in villages close to the rear.

The Chinese army has very amazing military education. After each decisive contact, a number of officers and junior soldiers who have completed their tasks are transferred back from the front line to training camps for one to three months of study. After they return to their units, they can train ordinary soldiers. Therefore, the army often discusses practical experience and corrects its own shortcomings. Speaking of which, there are tailors in the village with white stones, and many young soldiers in fancy clothes are studying military science there, but that is not the case. The headquarters and schools are made of bamboo fences and mud bricks, very simple, all built by the soldiers themselves.

The cleanliness and management of the houses and grounds in the army are well done, which is the only thing we have seen since we came to China. The army tries to make up for the shortcomings in equipment through training and organization. The training is based on the Prussian style, focusing on strictness and effectiveness, resulting in an army of 500,000 men who do not even wear leather shoes, but have a full understanding of how to fight. The army's salary is the lowest among government service personnel. In fact, it is the lowest salary in any institution in China. A colonel's monthly salary is only 150 yuan in legal tender, which is equivalent to only 7.25 U.S. dollars. But a pair of leather shoes in Chongqing costs 200 yuan, and the price of rice has also increased seven times compared to before the war. Ordinary soldiers earn 4.5 yuan in legal tender (25 U.S. cents) per month, plus some rice subsidies. The rice subsidy is 8 U.S. cents, and even with this money, he still cannot eat enough. It is said that a porter who carries things earns twice as much per month as a colonel. The low salary system of the army and the lack of necessary food for those who are sick and injured are the two major misfortunes in the Chinese army.

Enthusiastic Reception

After we dismounted at the headquarters, we saw slogans in English welcoming us. The red letters were underlined and posted on the guard post, barracks, and mud walls of the headquarters. The slogans read: "Welcome the representatives who uphold justice and peace." "Democratic countries unite and fight to the final victory." These slogans were drafted and printed by the staff of the political department. Once, they ran from a neighboring village to inquire where we were going so that they could rush ahead to post the slogans.

We brushed off the raindrops on our faces, bowed with a smile, and thanked them for their sincere hospitality. The commander-in-chief wore white gloves to show his solemnity and returned our greetings repeatedly. The wind blew into the house, blowing through the windows without glass. We sat next to a pot of blazing charcoal fire, secretly drying our shoes and calves. The commander chatted with us in his spare time.

The wind blew all night, and it didn't seem cold while sleeping. But tomorrow morning, the sky will be clear, and we can see the distant mountains undulating. We rode our horses up the hill. The interpreter, Ma Jun, rode right behind me. Ma Jun was small in stature, wore a pair of tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses that were too big for him, had a good appetite, and had two American degrees, but had no military experience. He now works in the Political Department in Shaoguan.

"Ma Guangsheng," I pointed to the scorched mountain in front and said, "Why did they burn all the trees on this mountain?" "They want to drive away the tigers on the mountain," Ma Jun said. "You see, tigers eat the fine roots and grasses of certain plants. If they burn the trees, they will feel hungry and run away."

After nine hours of riding without food or water, I felt very tired, but the Chinese did not feel tired. They can silently accept any changes: hunger, fatigue, cold, thirst, pain, and danger. They are the most resilient people in the world. We dismounted in a village, which was also the headquarters of a regimental unit. The headquarters building was made of brick, and the streets were all dirt paths, full of garbage and filth. There were no sewers.

We followed an officer on horseback to the parade ground to inspect a battalion of soldiers. These soldiers were originally farmers and coolies. Before joining the army, they had never even held something as complicated as a flashlight. If you look at them alone, or in small squads scattered in the mountains, they are as pitiful as orphans, as ragged as beggars. But in this solemn formation, equipped with rifles, machine guns, automatic rifles, and hand grenades, they look like a strong and experienced team. Now they began to drill, with the sergeant shouting sharp commands. The old men in the village watched quietly, standing by the fields with a proud look on their faces. When the war broke out, other farmers rescued the wounded and carried them on bamboo stretchers through rugged mountain roads to the rear hospitals. There was no water to drink along the way, no dressing station. If no one was willing to carry them, there would be no wounded soldiers, they would all die!

"We are going to put on a play tonight," the officer said. The Chinese army lit bonfires on the parade ground, and twelve hundred people sat on the hard, cold dirt, waiting for the play to begin. A blue cloth curtain was hung on the bamboo stage, and they spent an hour and a half setting up a gas lamp. Suddenly the light came on, then slowly dimmed, finally adjusting to the appropriate brightness. Two soldiers pulled the curtain open, and the play began. The name of the play was "Ghosts." It was wonderful. At the end of the play, twelve hundred soldiers applauded wildly. Even a famous play staged in New York would not have such enthusiasm. The political department puts on a play for the soldiers every week.

### Under Economic Pressure, Japan Still Tries to Struggle

Britain Denies Negotiating a Barter Agreement with Japan, Resolves Not to Relax the Freezing of Supplies to Japan

United Press, London, 20th - The news that Japan proposed to Britain and the Netherlands to establish a barter agreement but was denied by Britain yesterday proves that Tokyo is now beginning to struggle under the economic pressure of the Allied countries. Dutch authorities acknowledge that private companies in the Dutch East Indies have allowed their coffee, tea, and sugar merchants to discuss trade matters with Japan. However, these people solemnly pointed out that the Dutch East Indies government has no intention of approving export permits, so these merchants cannot sell goods to Japan even if they want to. Authorities here said that the Dutch East Indies has no intention of resuming oil exports, and it is impossible to include rubber in the scope of export discussions as rumored by private businesses.

Reuter's, London, 20th - A responsible statement was issued here last night, saying that the rumor that Britain and Japan were negotiating a barter agreement seemed to have originated from information obtained by the Yokohama Specie Bank. The information mentioned the use that the bank could allow in the future flow of approved goods. The fact is that, in order to fully maintain the effectiveness of the freezing order, frozen funds cannot be released to supply exports to Japan. However, a method is now being considered: if a license for the import of Japanese goods is decided to be issued in any special case, the payment for this licensed import must be paid into a clearing account, and the funds in this clearing account can only be used to pay for licensed exports to Japan. Export licenses can only be issued for approved goods that can be paid for by funds in the clearing account. Similar arrangements are currently being made elsewhere in the British Empire, and the maintenance costs of diplomats and consuls are also provided in the same way.

Reuter's, London, 20th - The Yokohama Specie Bank yesterday firmly denied that the bank is currently negotiating a barter agreement with the Bank of England.

### Toyota-Grew Talks Broad in Scope

Tokyo Asks to Restore Commerce, U.S. Effectively Rejects

Haitong News Agency, Washington, 20th - Hull declared at a press conference yesterday that Foreign Minister Toyota and Ambassador Grew had a long conversation the day before. The discussion was not limited to the issue of American nationals leaving Japan. Political figures here believe that all important Japanese-American issues were mentioned.

International News Service, Washington, 20th - Japan's request to restore normal Japanese-American commercial relations has been effectively rejected by the United States. It is evident that the U.S. will adopt a more advanced economic strategy to deal with Japan. The U.S. government has made it clear to Japan that the U.S. is unwilling to make economic concessions to Japan by restoring commerce, because the U.S. is certain that this trade may be used to strengthen Japan's military establishment, and the U.S. may one day suffer the consequences. The government replied to Japan's request that the U.S. is willing to supply Japan with crude oil to meet peacetime needs, but the U.S. insists on its policy of not transporting military supplies to Japan. If Japan still threatens to disrupt the status quo in the Pacific and the Far East, the U.S. will continue to impose economic sanctions. It is rumored that Tokyo is also aware that if it continues to cooperate with the Axis powers, it must be prepared to accept the consequences of possible retaliatory actions by the Allied countries. It is also implied that if Japan does not change its policy, it will be subjected to an economic blockade by Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union, and will not be able to obtain goods from any country.

### U.S. Awaiting Japanese Explanation on Rejection of Evacuation

United Press, Washington, 20th - Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that the United States is still waiting for Japan to provide a satisfactory explanation for the rejection of the evacuation of American nationals. Hull said at a press conference that the report sent by U.S. Ambassador Grew to Washington is, so far, not sufficient to determine what action the United States will take. Before making this statement, Hull had a brief conversation with Secretary of War Stimson. Afterwards, Secretary Stimson said that the content of their conversation was only a general exchange of information on the international situation.

### Anglo-American Talks Conclude with Four Points

Haitong News Agency, Washington, 20th - Both the "Washington Post" and the "Washington Times Herald" published editorials today stating that the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting has decided on four points: (1) to open an air route from the United States to Africa, with American pilots flying American planes and handing them over to the British Air Force; (2) Roosevelt and Churchill are very optimistic about the Soviet Union's resistance, believing that the Soviet Union can pay for American loans with food and gold; (3) the attitude of Britain and the United States towards Japan is becoming increasingly tough, in order to prevent Japan from taking any measures against Siberia or Thailand; (4) the United States has no obligation to participate in the war. The above four points were announced after the White House received the Democratic leaders.

### Heated Debate in U.S. Senate

Reuter's, Washington, 20th - During a heated debate in the Senate yesterday over the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, Barkley claimed that when President Roosevelt and congressional leaders met at the White House, the possibility of the United States sending an expeditionary force to help Britain attack the European continent was neither discussed nor indicated. Republican Senator Johnson said that point six of the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration has established a defense alliance between Britain and the United States, which is an obligation that could lead the United States to war. Democratic Senator Clark asked Senate Majority Leader Barkley, "If President Roosevelt, his son, and key members of the U.S. Army and Navy were on the British warship Prince of Wales when it was bombed, would that not be an act of war? Does the President intend to place himself in a position that could lead to an act of war?" Barkley replied that when the U.S. President is on a British warship and a U.S. warship is docked next to it, if enemy aircraft or warships bomb or destroy the British warship, it would cause great shock to the American people and create a difficult situation for a certain foreign country. If boarding a British warship is risky, the President is willing to take the risk in order to provide the world with a joint declaration that results from it.

### Five Germans Flee from Vietnam, Arrested After Sneaking into Burma

Reuter's, Rangoon, 20th - Five Germans, believed to have escaped from the French Foreign Legion in Vietnam, crossed the border into Burma and were arrested at Victoria Point. They have been brought to Rangoon by the police for detention.

(3) If a two-part teaching system is implemented, the direct teaching time and automatic homework time of each class should be allocated properly. If a half-day two-part teaching system is implemented, the number of direct teaching hours may be appropriately reduced. (4) The allocation of teaching time for each subject should be based on 20 minutes per session in principle, and may be extended to 45 or 60 minutes depending on the nature of the subject.

5. Teaching Materials: The teaching materials for two-year short-term elementary schools should pay attention to the following points: (1) The teaching materials for each subject should focus on meeting practical needs of life and cultivating national consciousness and national concepts, and should be selected concisely and precisely. (2) The compilation of teaching materials for each subject should be based on psychological principles and supplemented by logical principles. (3) The teaching materials for each subject should be described in vernacular Chinese, and the vocabulary used should be mainly those commonly needed in daily life. (4) Chinese teaching materials should pay attention to the cultivation of national consciousness and national concepts on the one hand, and should be based on children's actual lives on the other hand, fully considering children's reading ability and interest. (5) General knowledge teaching materials should pay attention to national and livelihood needs on the one hand, and should pay attention to the universal nature and practicality of the teaching materials themselves on the other hand. Their compilation should be closely linked to Chinese teaching materials. (6) Arithmetic teaching materials should adopt a mixed compilation of written calculation and abacus. (7) Civic training should formulate items according to the social environment and the needs of children's lives in each locality and implement them seriously. (8) Work teaching materials should mainly be related to local production and specialties. (9) Singing should focus on games and basic exercises. In rural areas, climbing mountains, walking, and field work can be used instead. Songs can use local popular songs with educational value and interest, and local popular musical instruments can be used as auxiliary teaching aids. (10) In addition to the textbooks compiled by the Ministry, each locality may compile supplementary teaching materials themselves.

6. Teaching Methods: The teaching methods for each subject in two-year short-term elementary schools should pay attention to the following points: (1) The teaching of each subject should pay close attention to practical application, and children should acquire a full understanding and practice of the knowledge and skills necessary for daily life and suitable for the special needs of the local society. (2) Speaking and reading texts during teaching should use standard Mandarin or a common language close to standard Mandarin. (3) Teaching should focus on arousing students' existing experience and stimulating learning interest. (4) The teaching method should emphasize the heuristic question-and-answer style. (5) Students' learning abilities vary, and group or team teaching should be tried, and students with better levels should be trained to lead learning and act as assistants to teachers.

### After the Stabilization Fund Sets New Exchange Rates, Settlement Methods Have Been Established

Nine Designated Chinese and Foreign Banks to Handle; British Commissioners to Supervise Implementation in Shanghai

Since the Stabilization Fund Committee announced new exchange rates on the 18th, allowing certain banks to settle and sell foreign exchange for legitimate trade, the value of the legal tender has risen. Chinese and foreign merchants have benefited from this, and morale has been greatly boosted. It is widely believed that this move by the Committee has significant political and economic implications. At the request of the Chinese government, the United States and the United Kingdom simultaneously froze Chinese funds to help the Chinese government control exchange rates, manage trade, and prevent funds from falling into Japanese hands, thereby eliminating speculative activities. The aforementioned objectives have now been initiated and are being put into action with considerable success.

Additional British Commissioners to Work in Shanghai

In order to understand the actual situation in Shanghai and to regularly adopt countermeasures to address the foreign exchange issues in the Shanghai market, the Stabilization Fund Committee, in addition to Dr. Taylor, who is currently in Shanghai assisting, to continue researching and collecting relevant information, will also send a newly appointed Commissioner, E.L. Hall Patch, to Shanghai in the short term. Mr. Hall Patch is the British Far East Financial Counselor. He was asked to succeed Mr. Rogers, the original Commissioner, who was transferred to Hong Kong as an economic advisor to the government. His mission to Shanghai includes five points: (1) to liaise with the authorities of Allied Banks and National Banks in Shanghai and instruct them on the decisions and countermeasures of the Stabilization Fund; (2) to study the effectiveness of the British and American freezing orders and minimize loopholes as much as possible; (3) to supervise the implementation of the designated banks in Shanghai providing foreign exchange at the new exchange rates set by the Stabilization Fund; (4) to analyze the import and export trade situation in Shanghai, prevent exporters from freely selling foreign exchange, and prevent importers from requesting foreign exchange for non-essential goods; (5) to investigate the situation of Chinese legal tender and price fluctuations in Shanghai and the occupied areas, and strive to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on prices.

Nine Banks Ordered to Handle

A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency made a special visit to a senior official of the Bank of China yesterday afternoon to inquire about everything. He explained in detail that the Stabilization Fund Committee has specifically authorized only nine banks to provide foreign exchange at the new exchange rates: US$5.34375 and GB£3 3/16 per Spanish dollar, for those engaged in legitimate import trade with China. These banks are: (1) British: HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, Australia and China, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China; (2) American: Citibank, Chase Bank; (3) Chinese: Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China. The other nine banks listed in General Ruling No. 55 of the United States, designated as having special privileges to operate foreign exchange business, such as (1) American Allied Banking Corporation, ____, (1) Soviet Moscow Narodny Bank, (3) British: Sassoon Banking Corporation, David Sassoon & Co., E.D. Sassoon & Co., Sassoon Trading Co.; (4) Dutch: Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, are not included.

Restricted to the Sterling Area

The settlement and sale of this foreign exchange must meet the requirements of General Ruling No. 58: (1) It must be a bona fide import trade, and the amount applied for must be equal to the import value; (2) It must not be a trade operated or entrusted by a blocked country outside China or its people, or by the people of the three northeastern provinces; (3) It must not be a trade related to the interests of a blocked country outside China or its people, or the people of the three northeastern provinces; Second, the imported goods must come from the Sterling Area; Third, it must be an imported commodity not listed in the embargo regulations announced by the Chinese Customs authorities on July 4, 1939, and subsequently amended.

Advance Settlement, Retroactive Approval

Fourth, applicants must provide supporting documents, such as bills of lading, invoices, and transportation documents, to prove that it is not a speculative act. Fifth, after the above nine banks accept the application and pass the review, they can grant the advance settlement of foreign exchange, but reserve two weeks. Within this period, the Hong Kong office or agent of each bank shall submit a triplicate application form to the Hong Kong office of the Stabilization Fund, and then submit it to the Chongqing Stabilization Fund for approval. If the Committee believes that it violates the embargo regulations, the foreign exchange settled must be sold again.

Rice and Coal Issues Still Need Instructions

Regarding whether the rice and coal needed in the Shanghai concession area can be settled at the new exchange rate, it is said that (1) the embargo regulations issued by the Chinese Customs authorities have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the specific provisions are unknown; (2) since the imported goods must come from the Sterling Area to be settled at the new exchange rate, the rice and coal imported into Shanghai are not entirely from the Sterling Area, as evidenced by Vietnam, and foreign exchange cannot be obtained at this favorable exchange rate. This issue still needs to be referred for instructions. The external statement that it can be supplied according to the new exchange rate is not true.

Embargoed Goods Divided into Twelve Categories

Regarding the embargo regulations announced by the Chinese Customs authorities on July 4, 1939, although there have been several revisions since then, the initial announcement is still the basis. According to investigations by Da Zhong News Agency, the embargoed goods are divided into a total of twelve categories and 160 items. Due to space limitations, only the category names are listed below: (1) Cotton and cotton fabrics; (2) Flax, ramie, hemp, jute, and their products; (3) Wool and its products; (4) Silk and its products; (5) Food, beverages, and herbal medicines; (6) Tobacco; (7) Candles, soap, fats, waxes, glues, and rosin; (8) Books, maps, and paper; (9) Raw and processed animal materials and their products (such as leather, pig bristles, horsehair, ivory, etc. are all included); (10) Wood, lumber, bamboo, rattan, grass, and their products; (11) Porcelain, enamel, glass, and other items; (12) Miscellaneous (such as amber, coral, tortoiseshell and their products, antiques, curios, lacquerware, metal ornaments, fans, phonographs, jewelry, etc.).

Official Announcement to Be Released Soon

The Times reports that the Stabilization Fund Committee's order to help merchants of democratic countries obtain favorable exchange rates is still awaiting detailed news. According to HSBC officials, "The official announcement on this matter may be released within the next two days." The Chongqing government's list of prohibited imports was first published in July 1939 and has been revised several times since. It is generally expected that the latest revision will be released soon. Bank and money industry officials suggested that the current difficulty in purchasing foreign exchange, even for legal imports, will continue until detailed information is released in Hong Kong or Chongqing.

Current Transactions are Few

The China Press reports that yesterday (19th), import merchants in this city still did not know how to conduct legitimate trade, but in general, the situation yesterday was not much different from Monday (18th). Import trade from the United Kingdom, the United States, the Sterling Area, and the Dutch East Indies is within the scope of the new regulations announced by the Stabilization Fund Committee. All import trade must be proven to be legitimate before it can be settled at the new exchange rate. Therefore, yesterday (19th), the number of transactions based on the new exchange rate was very small. Another fact that has greatly inconvenienced legitimate import trade is that only a few people have obtained a list of prohibited imports. This list is published on page 139 of the July 1939 issue of the British Chamber of Commerce Journal.

### Accumulated Water in the Western District Has Not Receded; Public Transportation Is Blocked

The recent heavy rains continued for days, coupled with higher tides, causing low-lying roads to become swamps. Yesterday, the weather was gloomy, with occasional light rain in the autumn wind. By the afternoon, there was a slight glimpse of sunshine. In the heart of the concession area, the accumulated water had receded. In the western district of the International Settlement, sections of roads such as Jing'an Temple Road, Moorehead Road, Hart Road, Haig Road, Foch Road, Connaught Road, and Xiaosha Ferry Road still had accumulated water. In the French Concession, the water on Avenue Joffre had receded, and the trams had resumed operation. However, areas such as the northern end of Route Tenant de la Tour, Route Paul Henry, and Avenue Albert were still flooded. On the western outskirts of Shanghai, roads such as Avenue Haig, Route Zicawei, Route Lafayette, Route Pottier, and Great Western Road had not seen any decrease in the water level. The water on Route Lafayette was waist-deep, and it is predicted that it will be difficult to recede completely within a day or two. Yesterday, the No. 10 Red Plate bus traveling from Avenue Edward VII to Duncin Road was also suspended due to water obstruction. Only the No. 14 White Plate bus continued to operate to Route Lafayette. The No. 2 bus traveling to Anhe Temple Road still maintained traffic through the water. All other vehicles traveling to the western district of Shanghai terminated at Jing'an Temple.

### Original Business Tax Plan Amended; Incorporated into House Rate Collection

Renamed Business House Rate Special Additional Tax

Complex Procedures Mean Implementation Not Immediate

Regarding the International Settlement's plan to levy a business tax, the Public Works Bureau's Finance Committee met on the afternoon of the 18th at 4:30 PM in the Public Works Bureau conference room to review the plan. It is reported that the original plan has been amended, renaming it the Business House Rate Special Additional Tax. It was also decided to submit this amendment to the Public Works Bureau meeting for a final decision. This tax is essentially a type of business income tax. In order to be legal, it will be changed to a type of house rate and clearly stipulated. In the future, there will be considerable restrictions on various business activities to ensure that taxes cannot be evaded. As for the contents of this tax, according to the investigation, it is roughly as follows: the new tax is levied based on the assessed value of business premises and is divided into two levels: Level A includes various offices, shops, factories, warehouses, docks, and other general business premises; Level B includes various exchanges. The Level A tax rate is 8% per year for houses with an assessed value exceeding $3,000. The Level B tax rate is 15% per year for houses with an assessed value exceeding $3,000. The total annual revenue is approximately $7 million. (The method of calculating the tax and the tax rates are roughly similar to the business tax currently levied in the French Concession.) This plan will be submitted for discussion as soon as the Public Works Bureau's holiday ends on the 3rd of next month. However, this tax is a new creation and still needs to go through various procedures, so its implementation may be delayed until January of next year.

### Japanese Merchants Affected by Freezing Order; Silk Market Turns

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that as a result of the U.S. freezing Chinese and Japanese funds, the situation in the Shanghai silk market has completely changed. Before the freezing order was issued, the Japanese tried their best to prevent non-Japanese exporters from obtaining silk in Central China in order to transport it to New York for sale themselves. However, the Japanese are eager to avoid the risk of being frozen, so they would rather sell raw silk to other firms in this city. According to Japanese newspapers in this city, the Japanese Central China Silk Company has received instructions not to export raw silk to the United States, but can sell it to non-Japanese exporters in this city at will. Therefore, in the past two weeks, the Japanese have sold a large amount of raw silk from Central China to Shanghai's Chinese, British, American, and other exporters. It is reported that the liner President Coolidge carried no less than 6,000 bales of silk from this port to the United States last week.

### Rumor of Train Derailment at Double Bridge on the Shanghai-Jiaxing Railway

Dozens of Yards of Track Destroyed; Dozens of Passengers Injured

According to people from Suzhou yesterday, another train derailment occurred on the middle section of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Railway the night before. It is reported that at around 2:55 PM the day before, a passenger train departing from Suzhou for Jiaxing derailed at around 5:00 PM near Double Bridge, north of Wangjiangjing and south of Jiaxing, because dozens of yards of track had been destroyed. One locomotive overturned into the river. It is rumored that dozens of passengers were injured. The Japanese are currently rushing to repair the tracks.

### French Ships Between Shanghai and Vietnam Increase Freight Rates

Increase of 15%; Passenger Fares Not Increased

A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inquired with the French Navigation Company yesterday and learned the new freight rates for general cargo between Shanghai and Vietnam: (1) The freight rate from Shanghai to Haiphong increased from HK$28 to HK$33 per ton; (2) The freight rate from Shanghai to Saigon increased from HK$31 to HK$36 per ton, an increase of 15%. According to the company's staff, the implementation date of the above-mentioned new freight rates will be after the departure of the Benares on the 23rd of this month and the departure of the General Joffre on the 24th. The freight rates for the company's ships sailing from Manila to Shanghai have already increased by 20% last week. The passenger fares for all ships belonging to the company will not be increased. It is also learned that the shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam has been very prosperous recently, so the shipping industry has been very developed. In addition to the General Joffre, there are three more ships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this month: (1) The Kindian arrives on the 24th; The Kaiting arrives on the 27th; The Ganquinnan arrives on the 29th. Each ship carries a large amount of rice and coal. The goods carried by the ships sailing to Vietnam are mostly cloth.

### Rumor of Domestic Postage Increase; Shanghai Post Office Has Not Received Clear Orders

Domestic postage rates were increased once last year, and there is now a rumor that domestic postage rates will be increased again starting September 1. A reporter from Da Tong News Agency inquired with the person in charge of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday morning and learned that the bureau has not yet received a clear order from the General Post Office to increase rates and cannot make a decision. However, judging from the recent increase in prices, increasing postage rates is a reasonable measure and there is nothing wrong with it.

### Japanese Spokesperson Denies That American Nationals Are Being Detained as Hostages

More Japanese Nationals in the United States Than American Nationals in Japan

American Nationals Can Now Come to Shanghai to Return Home

The Continental Daily News reports that Mr. Hori, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy, stated yesterday (19th) afternoon when meeting with reporters that American nationals would not be detained in Japan as hostages as rumored. Although he had not received official information on this matter, the Reuters report had reported that American nationals in Japan could come to Shanghai. With this opening, the plan to "detain nationals as hostages" could not exist. If Japan took this measure, the blow to itself would be heavier than to the United States because there were far more Japanese nationals in the United States than American nationals in Japan. As far as he knew, the Japanese side had never implemented any restrictions prohibiting American nationals from coming to Shanghai from Japan. The "closed door" policy recently adopted by the Japanese in Japan, prohibiting foreigners who have not obtained special permits from entering or leaving, is not retaliation for the U.S. and British freezing orders. This new method had been considered for some time and was officially implemented on August 15.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: This Session's Undertaking Successfully Completed

Donations from All Circles Suspended from Today; Donations Still Hopeful for Enthusiastic Contributions When Winter Session Resumes

Total Donations Amounted to $54,204.01

Since the launch of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, it has been misguidedly supported by all sectors of society. Within 38 days, the fund has raised more than $54,000. The number of people coming to the office to donate in the scorching heat every day is still very enthusiastic. From this, we can see the earnest expectations of the people in society for young students and the widespread promotion of the human spirit of mutual assistance. This kind of invaluable social heat has prompted the staff of this newspaper to work diligently and carefully on scholarship fund matters, which is profound and significant. At the same time, the sympathy and encouragement that the recipient students have received from society should inspire them to be more grateful and vigilant. Now that the schools are about to open, the quota for the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund for this period has also been reviewed and finalized by the gentlemen of the committee and will be announced one after another. The scholarship funds will also be distributed within the next few days. All the procedures for this period will be explained in detail by the staff in accordance with the decisions and instructions of the committee. We hope that people from all walks of life and the gentlemen of the readers who generously donated funds will provide guidance and we will be grateful.

Donations for This Period Suspended

The enthusiasm of all sectors of society in donating this time, with some saving on food and clothing, some diverting entertainment expenses, some using business income, and some generously contributing out of sincerity, including banks, companies, pharmaceutical factories, firms, and social elites, men and women from all walks of life, workers, and children, have all been enthusiastic in helping. In addition, people carried money to the office in the sweltering heat. This kind of spirit is commendable. Now that the scholarship quota for this period has been reviewed and finalized and is sufficient to meet the needs of all students who have applied, this newspaper has decided that, except for the gentlemen who have confirmed monthly donations, it will stop accepting donations for the Readers' Scholarship Fund from today. There are many people who are enthusiastically helping with education and are continuing to donate generously. The staff of this newspaper believe that the organization of an event should have a clear sense of procedure. When the second period (winter) continues to be handled, we will announce it again and ask for the donations of readers. The staff will also take this period of suspension of donations to shift their efforts to pay attention to the academic progress of the recipient students in order to live up to the initial wishes of the readers who donated to the scholarship fund. We hope that people from all walks of life will understand our intentions.

Income and Expenditure Accounts to Be Released Soon

As of yesterday, the total amount of scholarship donations received from all sectors of society was $54,204.01. The approved quotas and amounts for university, vocational school, middle school, and elementary school students who applied this time have all been decided by the two committees. However, because the list of students approved for scholarships has not been fully announced and the funds are still to be collected, and the committee has decided that the educational funds for three disaster-stricken children and the funds for after-school tutoring requested by workers and businessmen should be allocated. Once all the procedures are completed, the amount of the remaining funds will be announced in detail and stored in a designated bank for use in supplementing the scholarship fund for the final period.

University Quota to Be Disclosed Tomorrow

The list of all students approved for scholarships, except for the elementary school section, which was published in this newspaper on the 15th, and the middle school students, which started to be published yesterday, has been repeatedly inquired by the applying students, which is due to the limited space of this newspaper and the inability to publish all of them on the same day. It is expected that the approved list of high school students will be fully announced on the 22nd. We also hope that the approved students will apply in person or be accompanied by their parents to the office to collect checks from the 25th of this month so that the staff of this newspaper can complete the procedures for the Readers' Scholarship Fund for this period as scheduled. As for those who the committee believes can be funded but need to be re-examined or submit additional documents, as well as the four free students, they will be announced after the review procedures are completed.

Comrades of Foreign Firm Collect Funds to Help Students

A letter from the comrades of the Moo Foo Foreign Firm reads, "Dear Sirs, recently, we read in your newspaper that you are organizing a scholarship fund, which not only benefits poor students, but also cultivates talents for the country and society. We, the comrades, uphold the principle of human mutual assistance and contribute to the best of our ability. We have collected a total of $200. We know that a drop in the bucket is limited, but the beneficiaries are limited, but every little bit helps, and we hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will enthusiastically support it, and it will definitely be effective." Also, a letter from Mr. Ling Yongxiang of Universal Wireless Telegraph Company reads, "I had a new grandson last week. At this time of turmoil, I cannot bear to be extravagant, so I have allocated 50 legal currency from the expenses for the happy eggs to be sent to relatives and friends to donate to the scholarship fund. When the full month is over, I will save more on banquets and continue to offer it." The enthusiasm is admirable.

Total of More Than $54,000

The gentlemen who donated yesterday are as follows: Mr. Wang Nianzu $100, Mr. Wang Nianzi $100, Mr. Zhao Peiwen $50, Zhenhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory $50, Mr. Ling Yongxiang (saving happy eggs for adding a grandson) $50, Mr. Zhang Tifang $30, comrades of Moo Foo Foreign Firm $200, (Ling Jinyuan $40, Zai Xuchun $30, Qian Qinghao $20, Chong Deyao $20, Xi Shunxing $20, Dai Gongbei $10, Xie Kaichun $10, Lu Junyao $10, Han Shichang $10, Bao Yongyun $5, Han Huilian $5, Wang Changjian $5, Miss Wang $5, Wang Bin $5, Yan Fulin $3, Chen Deming $2, Si Dongjun (manuscript fee) $8.50, Huang Songbai, a third-year student of Danhua Elementary School, $3, Qian Tinglian $1, a total of $592.50, previously deposited $53,611.51, for a total of $54,204.01. From today, donations from all sectors of society will be stopped.

### American Freighter "Alexander" Released

Heard the reason for the detention was due to exceeding the draft limit.

The American President Lines freighter "Alexander" sailed from San Francisco Bay to Shanghai on the 16th of this month. After the ship entered, it had just passed the water barrier of the blockade line in Nanshi when it was suddenly detained by the Japanese Navy. After negotiations, the Japanese Navy released the ship on the afternoon of the 19th and allowed it to continue exporting. It is said that the reason for the detention was that the ship's draft exceeded the 7-meter limit, which hindered navigation. According to sources from the American President Lines, the ship had recently been ordered to come to Shanghai to participate in cargo transportation. It had been serving in San Francisco Bay. After arriving in Shanghai on the 16th, the ship docked at the Laoda Lai Shipping Company wharf to unload cargo, which led to the detention by the Japanese side. After being released, the ship originally planned to leave Shanghai empty on a certain day, but due to heavy rain, the sailing date was postponed.

### Increased Electricity Rates Affect Commodity Prices

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that Shanghai business people believe that since the Shanghai Municipal Council has approved the Shanghai Power Company to increase electricity rates for electricity usage exceeding the allocated amount, the prices of products in this city may increase significantly as a result. The reason is that most manufacturers here will likely continue to use the same amount of electricity as usual and increase the selling prices of their products to cope with the rise in electricity rates. This is because many factories cannot continue to operate if they reduce their electricity consumption due to the extremely high excess electricity rates.

### American Court Counselor Luden Reappointed for Four Years

Nelson E. Lnston, Counselor of the United States Court for China, upon the order of Judge Helmick of the Court, has been reappointed for four years and was sworn into office at the court the day before yesterday. Mr. Luden has served in this position three times. He first served as Counselor of the Court from 1918 until he resigned in 1927 to partner with lawyer Mr. Hall in a private law firm. He was reappointed to this position in 1937. The original term was scheduled to expire the day before yesterday. Because Judge Helmick took leave to return to the United States, and someone was needed to take care of court affairs, Mr. Helmick telegraphed from Washington requesting a reappointment. After Mr. Helmick left Shanghai, Mr. Luden acted as an agent in civil and criminal cases, but important cases still await Mr. Helmick's personal trial after he returns to Shanghai. For example, the recent case of Sheriff Taylor Bauer of the Court involved in corruption. Unless the American government appoints a special judge to handle the case, it must wait until Mr. Helmick comes to Shanghai before the trial can begin.

### Coal Briquette Costs Should Be Thoroughly Investigated by Authorities

Prices Raised Arbitrarily Again Yesterday

The Coal Briquette Industry Association issued a rebuttal yesterday against the seven major coal briquette factories, including Yi Tai Xing and Nanyang, for withdrawing from the association, and issued a public notice to all sectors, pointing out that the withdrawal was without any reason. The ten factories, including Yi Tai Xing and Nanyang, also published their costs in the newspaper and changed their selling prices. According to the order of the French Concession Police Department, the retail price of coal briquettes is set at 16.6 yuan per dan. Now these factories have increased it to 17.2 yuan, causing a public outcry. The French authorities will thoroughly investigate. The manufacturing costs and raw material figures published by these factories are much higher than those calculated and published by the association, which further arouses public alarm. The coal dross used by the factories are all stockpiled goods with very low costs.

### Redemption of Debt and Payment of Interest Handled by Hong Kong Banks

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has ordered chambers of commerce and trade associations in various regions to allocate funds from the national treasury revenue for the principal and interest due on the public bonds of 500 million national currency issued on September 1, 1937, and deposit them in special accounts in the Central Bank and the Bank of China for payment. Bondholders are requested to collect the due principal and interest from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and their branches in various regions starting from August 31. The first interest coupon will be payable from August 31, 1938, and the three-year payment period will end on August 31, 1941. Bondholders who have not collected the interest are urged to do so before the deadline; payments will be stopped after the deadline. A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications yesterday that due to environmental reasons, the Shanghai branches of these three banks will temporarily not handle payments. Bondholders are requested to collect the principal and interest from the Hong Kong branches of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Those who wish to collect the principal and interest should first obtain an application form, fill it out, and attach the winning bond or the interest coupon due to request payment.

### No Need to Obtain Permits for Shipping Goods to Syria

British Embassy Announces

The British Embassy announced last night (the 19th) that from now on, there is no need to obtain British naval permits for shipping goods to Syria and Lebanon, except for those passing through Iran or Iraq. However, shippers should note that the authorities in Syria and Lebanon have implemented strict import permit systems, and the British naval permit only indicates that the British government does not object to the goods being shipped to the Persian Gulf, and does not mean that it has been allowed to be imported into those two places, or that no import permit is required. According to the British announcement on August 19, Syria and Lebanon are no longer occupied territories.

### Japanese Nationals Concentrated in the Philippines to Withdraw to Shanghai Aboard the "General Chaffee"

Arrival in Shanghai Delayed by One Day Due to Fog at Sea Dutch Ship "Zeeshan" Sails Today

there are also 5,000 bags of tribute rice, which were also transported to this place by the "General Chaffee." However, the ship had not entered port as of last night. It is said that due to bad weather and fog at sea, the voyage was delayed and is expected to arrive today. It is also learned that the Dutch ship "Zeeshan" arrived in Shanghai last Saturday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan today. It will return to Shanghai again next week and then return to the East Indies.

### Case of Abduction and Murder of Copper Factory Owner by Snatching Hua Police

The Culprit Recovers from Injury and is Brought to Trial

Jin Huating, a native of Shaoxing and the owner of the Hujiang Copper Factory at 1200 Hart Road, was at work in his office at noon on June 4 of this year when his brother-in-law, Lu Renlin, together with three accomplices, brandished a handgun, made threatening noises, and handcuffed Jin, dragging him out of the factory gate and pushing him into a car with a forged pass, number 359 (military vehicle license). The car sped towards Hart Road on Route Robertsone in western Shanghai. There, they happened to encounter Hua Police officers No. 1062, No. 632, No. 901, No. 693, and No. 912, who glimpsed someone in the car

crying out for help.

They ordered the car to stop, but the car did not comply. Hua Police officer No. 632 pulled up the barbed wire fence to obstruct the car. In desperation, the group stopped the car, and the victim, Jin Huating, got out of the car one after another and fled separately. The Hua Police officers chased after them, and the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. As a result, Hua Police officer No. 632 was shot in a vital area and fell to the ground, dead. The remaining police officers were slightly injured. The driver of the bandit's car, Ma Songtao, a native of Ningbo, was also shot in the leg and captured on the spot. The victim, Jin Huating, was

rescued from danger and returned to the factory. Bandit Ma was taken to the police station and transferred to the police hospital for treatment. He only recovered the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special First Court, where Hua Detective Shang Wu and Detective Kong Guangxiao, who were handling the case, brought him to the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution on charges of kidnapping and murder, stating that the mastermind behind the case was Jin's brother-in-law, Lu Renlin, because he had previously borrowed 5,000 yuan from Jin but was not granted the loan. Later, he wrote

threatening letters, but Lu and the three other escaped kidnappers could not be apprehended. He requested an extension. The victim, Jin Huating, was not present and was represented by factory workers Zhao Ruichu and Shen Jiting, who testified to the situation of Lu Renlin and three bandits entering the factory to kidnap him. The judge, Jiang Shuzi, questioned the defendant, who gave evasive answers, and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further review.

### Xinqiao Street Iron Gate Opened Yesterday

The iron gate on Xinqiao Street, which borders the French Concession's Nine Acres area in Nanshi, was originally scheduled to open on the 19th after being approved by the Japanese military authorities in Nanshi. However, it was not opened due to the lack of approval from the French Concession authorities. The details have been recorded in newspapers for days. The Japanese side notified the French Concession authorities on the tenth of the month, and the French Concession Police Department dispatched police officers to implement the opening at 5:00 a.m. yesterday, allowing residents of the north and south cities to travel freely. The time remains the same as before, from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.

### Dishonest Weigher Beats Vegetable Vendor to Death

Husband and Wife Both Beaten to Death

Zhang Liangdi, a local resident, lived at 22 Hejia Pavilion behind Guanghua University on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai and was a vegetable vendor by trade. On the day before yesterday (the 18th), at 6:00 a.m., Zhang, as usual, accompanied his wife, Zhang Wang (45 years old), to the Central Market's Xuhui branch on Hongqiao Road to buy vegetables to sell in Shanghai, hoping to make a small profit to make a living. At that time, they selected several catties of green chili peppers, which were priced at three yuan. Zhang only had 2.8 yuan on him, lacking 0.2 yuan, so he negotiated with the weigher, Xu Deyuan, that he could make up the difference the next day. Xu refused, and an argument ensued. Xu then brutally beat Zhang, seriously injuring him. Zhang collapsed to the ground, barely breathing. His wife, Wang, was shocked to see this and cried out for help, but she was also beaten to the ground by Xu and fainted. Other vegetable vendors rose up in protest and called for a car to send the Zhang couple to the hospital for treatment. Zhang died soon after due to his serious injuries, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Zhang's wife, Wang, also died of her serious injuries at noon yesterday. The assailant, Xu Deyuan, has also been detained.

### Zhenjiang Fellow Townsmen Association to Organize Scholarship Fund

In recent years, as the cost of living index has continued to increase, even eating has become a concern. The education of children is naturally even more difficult to solve. The number of young people dropping out of school is increasing day by day, and aspiring young people are being excluded from schools. This is a major loss. The Zhenjiang Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, recognizing this, has recently begun to organize a scholarship fund. It has specially hired fellow townsmen Chen Peide, Yao Hanbin, Hu Chunlin, Zhou Daoqian, Wu Yunzhai, Zhang Haicheng, Li Hongshou, Liu Tanlin, Yang Chong, Yin Huanzhi, Li Wenjie, and Chen Rongfa to serve as members of the scholarship fund committee and manage the affairs. The estimated scholarship amount is 6,000 yuan per semester, which will be donated separately by the committee members and enthusiastic fellow townsmen who care about education. The accounting for this fund will be independent and managed by a commissioner recommended by the committee. The distribution of the scholarship will be divided into three parts: high school, junior high school, and elementary school. High school students will receive a scholarship of 80 yuan per semester per student, junior high school students will receive a scholarship of 60 yuan per semester per student, and elementary school students will receive a scholarship of 20 yuan per semester per student. The application registration period for this semester is from August 18 to September 5. Application requirements: (1) Must be a student from Zhenjiang; (2) Must be from a truly poor family; (3) Must be of excellent character and academic performance. Those who meet the above three requirements can bring two 2.5-inch photos of themselves to the association's office at 3 Zhifu Road (intersection of Zhejiang Road), second floor, to obtain a registration form and apply for registration, and attach a transcript from the most recent semester. After the registration procedures are completed, staff will be sent to investigate and conduct interviews, and the list of approved scholarship recipients will be announced before September 10. Any young students from Zhenjiang who are studying in Shanghai and meet the above requirements can go to register. Members of the Zhenjiang Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association who are aware of outstanding students who are ambitious but unable to attend school can introduce them to the association to apply for registration.

### The Merits of the Bomber

— Guo Hongdi

"The merits of the bomber?" You might say with indignation and hatred, "Killing people is the merit of the bomber! Flesh and blood are blurred, limbs are broken, people are killed like hemp, and cities are turned into ruins. These are the merits of the bomber!"

Your words are certainly correct, but wait, what I want to talk about is another kind of merit of the bomber, the merit of the bomber saving people.

It was at the end of 1935 that Mount Loa, the big volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, suddenly became active, with thick smoke and flames soaring into the sky. In a few weeks, the lava torrent became a river, and it had the potential to flow towards Hilo, the second largest port in Hawaii. At that time, the American volcanologist Dr. Xia Jia was closely monitoring the situation, paying attention to the volcano's activity and the direction of the lava flow. He noted that if the lava continued to flow east, the 20,000 residents of Hilo would have to abandon tens of millions of dollars worth of property and flee within two weeks, or they would be buried in the lava.

At this time, the situation was very tense. To save the 20,000 residents of Hilo and preserve their livelihoods, the only way was to find a way to stop or divert the lava flow. At this critical moment, Dr. Xia Jia had a flash of inspiration and came up with the only solution, which was to ask the army authorities to send bombers to bomb the crater.

The authorities agreed, first sending reconnaissance planes to observe the volcanic situation, then dropping test bombs, and finally five bombers taking turns dropping twenty 600-pound bombs into the crater. As a result, the speed of the lava flow gradually decreased, and after thirty-three hours, the lava completely stopped flowing, and three days later, the eruption of Mount Loa also stopped. Thus, the bomber saved the lives of 20,000 residents.

Not only is science innocent, but bombers are also innocent!

### The Future of the White-Clad Angel

— Feile

"I am a prisoner of the universe."

"Even beggars are stronger than me."

"I'd rather die than do this ghost's work in a white cap."

"..."

A series of curses erupted from the mouth of the white-clad angel.

If you knew, you would sympathize with her without reservation, nodding at her every complaint.

Yes, Florence Nightingale is great. Her spirit of "self-sacrifice" is worthy of our eternal admiration! But she would never have imagined that in some corner of this time and place, there would actually be a cry of "Save the nurses."

It's no exaggeration to say that Xian admired Florence Nightingale; at least, this starched "white cap," this strangely pleasing "Nurse," this slogan of "serving the people" had truly become the center of her fascination.

She entered this "Advanced Nursing School" like a little bird, or perhaps it was paradise for Xian.

She had quickly learned to make cotton balls, tear plaster, make beds, take temperatures, and count pulses.

She also knew how to ask patients, "How many bowel movements?"

Continuing, she could even mix petroleum jelly, measure units, dab boric acid solution, and administer enemas.

From six o'clock to six o'clock, from dawn to dusk, from the restroom to the outpatient department, she devoted her legs to their career.

"This is basic work!"

She remembered the dean's words, and she endured her fatigue. Although, she was somewhat anxious that she had not yet started the "Two Essential Nursing Books" and "Pediatric Nursing."

Although she hadn't taken classes yet, Xian's practical work had already entered the "honorary class" – she could already write "Sleep well" on the patient's chart. This was the dean's "promotion."

The dean made his rounds, bringing two pretty students with him, rewarding them with lipstick – yes, this was "giving patients a pleasant impression."

Xian was assigned to the "private room." The dean was particularly "eager to please" the first-class patient, and he instructed Xian "to be good."

"What a beautiful young lady, what's your name?" He even stroked Xian's dimple.

The dean did not accept Xian's protest. His intention was that nurses should obligingly accept the patient's teasing – no, "to give patients spiritual comfort."

Xian wondered, "Is this a product of Nightingale's 'self-sacrifice' principle?"

After some time, Xian also read two chapters of "Pharmacology." Then, she was also transferred to the "dispensing room."

Dispensing medicine was like this:

Soda powder plus red pigment was "oral medication," and distilled water injected into "Ampoules" was a "supplemental shot."

"There's even better!" The dean exchanged the patient's money for the tonics and injections. But his explanation was: "This is psychological therapy, it's the latest."

"Fei, I don't need to tell you any more embarrassing things about the dean and the nurses, anyway, the nurses must 'sacrifice,' 'give of themselves,' even sacrifice like Miss Xia."

"No, I don't admit that nurses have no future."

"Yes, yes! My future is either the doctor's concubine or a perpetual spinster!"

Xian's words were quite serious, and even her attitude was exerting a will. I was surprised that this little bird would turn into an eagle-like coldness.

"Don't be surprised at my transformation. The 'white cap' is a magic circle. It will turn liveliness into dullness, passion into ashes, and innocence into pretense!"

"The day I went in, I was laughing, then I was frowning, and now I've lit a fire."

"What?"

"Set a fire, to burn away the dark life!"

I was silent.

In the end, the white-clad angel still has a future.

I couldn't help but stroke the white cap on my head!

Twelfth Unexpected Turmoil

"Being friends with a pus-filled sack like you is just bad luck! " Bald Liu said, propping his right leg on a bench, his sheepskin coat open, his thick black eyebrows turned upside down, his voice full of fury, almost wanting to pounce on Shang Laoer to fight.

Shang Laoer had just returned from Zhangshucun, sitting in the bedroom Liu Baldy had let him have, a room less than two zhang square. He looked very depressed.

"If the written agreement doesn't count, then what can be trusted?" Baldy Liu shouted several times in a desperate manner, unknowingly making his inverted round face, which was sharp on top and broad on the bottom, flush red; a short, fat body with this liver-colored round face looked, from seven or eight steps away, like a ripe pumpkin!

He saw that Shang Laoer was still silent and not speaking, and his anger rose even more.

"What is he anyway, does he not even acknowledge reason!" Even though Baldy Liu was a painted face on stage, in private he always liked to show off his coarse voice.

"Regardless of whether he was a star ten years ago or just a bit player, as long as his daughter kowtowed to you and studied acting, he has no right to interfere! Besides, the written agreement has been settled, so why can he go back on his word? It's amazing that you can still put up with this! Damn it, if you provoke me to take action, I'll either beat him to death or make him lie in bed for three years or so..."

"Old brother, don't be so impulsive. You haven't heard me finish yet!" Shang Laoer finally raised his head and said weakly.

"Finish? What else is there to say!" Baldy Liu asked, staring fiercely at the other party, as if he was angry with Shang Laoer. (190)

Military Preparations

### Training Anti-Aircraft Gunners

— Ke Zhong

In order to train anti-aircraft gunners, the British military authorities have created a model aircraft that can slide back and forth on electric wires. The anti-aircraft gunners then aim with a "photo gun" so that when the aircraft enters the firing range of the anti-aircraft gun, they can turn the firing pin. This training method is both practical and saves ammunition and the consumption of model aircraft. Moreover, in rainy weather, it can also be moved indoors for training, without any difficulties or inconveniences. It is expected that these mass-produced anti-aircraft gunners will give a serious blow to aggressive enemies.

Education

### Tireless Effort

— Xin Liang

In the graduating class of 1941 at George Washington University in the United States, there was an elderly student, Mrs. Isabelle Barnes Haggett, who was seventy-eight years old; her spirit of tireless pursuit of knowledge is truly worthy of our emulation. She came to the United States eight years ago, and in order to do some work, she decided to go to college to study. She herself admitted that when she first started, it was difficult for her to compete with the young students. She wore dentures, which made it impossible to correct her original French accent; but she had a passion for learning, and no matter how bad the weather, she never missed a class, and finally graduated with third-class honors. Do readers think that she was finished after getting her bachelor's degree? No, no, according to her own account, she will continue to study European history in the fall to obtain a master's degree.

The so-called "learning knows no bounds," the so-called "learn until you are old, but you will never finish learning," after seeing such an example of "the older, the stronger," we certainly feel more and more the truth of these two sentences; what reason do we young people have to waste our studies and engage in absurd pastimes?

### Utilizing Time

— Zhong Liang

The reason why the great French naturalist Lamarck became famous is by no means without reason.

Due to circumstances, Lamarck resolutely entered the military camp at the age of seventeen and galloped on the battlefield. Unfortunately, this young hero encountered an accident in less than four years. He was forced to go to Paris to recuperate. However, according to his condition, he had to quietly stay in bed for a year.

Lamarck's sickroom was a small attic. At this time, his suffering can be imagined. However, looking out from the only skylight in the entire room, the clouds floating back and forth in the sky aroused his interest. In his loneliness, Lamarck used his free time to do things that others considered meaningless. He categorized various clouds and judged their impact on the climate based on their shape and structure. For example, large black "rain clouds" would bring powdery white snow. Layered "cumulus clouds," if they appeared in the east, were a sign that the long summer heat was diminishing, and beautiful and thin "white cirrus clouds" could determine a clear weather.

Later, Lamarck finally recovered completely, and he could rejoin the army, but he could see all kinds of weather at a glance, so from then on, Lamarck devoted himself to natural history.

Neon Light Aids Growth

London's beautiful neon lights were all turned off when the war broke out. But they now have "wartime work."

It turns out that British scientists have recently discovered that neon light can make plants grow very quickly. Therefore, small neon lights have been installed in gardens at various farms and plant research institutes. This type of neon light is called "Irradiators."

This idea originally came from the Netherlands. The Dutch had discovered that bayberries could ripen in February under glass.

Entertainment World

### Art Offstage

— Zhang Songran

The art on stage, such as seat monopolization, hawkers shouting like vendors, and lighting coordination, safety equipment, etc., has gradually improved in many more upscale entertainment venues with the times. Now, only the entire audience has not yet understood the true meaning of entertainment, broadly speaking, it is the general order of society, and narrowly speaking, it is the "art offstage" that I want to talk about.

Shanghainese who go to the cinema to have fun are relatively the most punctual, because if they are late, the "sold out" sign will be hung high outside the theater door, and missing the mark will result in a refund. Even if you are lucky enough to buy a ticket, and the trailer has already started, it is not easy to choose a seat that is both well-angled and comfortable in the darkness.

The theater is not comparable to the low-level civilization drama. Ninety-nine percent of the audience are intellectuals, but there are more who are not punctual. Often, when the second or third act has just begun, there are still people coming in one after another. The wonderfulness of a drama lies in its acts, and the value of a scene lies in its scenes. Watching fewer acts will make it impossible to understand the characters' personalities and positions, and there is no way to understand the continuity of the plot. Spending money may not matter, but aren't you far away from your desired purpose? Drama actors express themselves with straightforward dialogue, unlike Peking opera, which has six-character tunes and B-character tunes, so the theater needs "silence" even more. But there are also some people coughing and spitting at this time, one after another, making a noisy mess.

The national opera theater is the worst, with three floors no less. Speaking of the main hall, it is said that those who watch the opening act are amateurs. Professionals arrive on time only when the famous actors come on stage, which is also the advantage of assigned seating. Therefore, for the automobile class, it is as unimpeded as in the case table era. Those who arrive late stand in front of you, waiting for the attendant to lead them to their seats, while enjoying the view first. As for whether they are blocking other people's view, that is not in their minds. After being seated, they call for tea and cigarettes, and also eat melon seeds and peel melon rind. If the stage is performing a wonderful part, or a good tune, wouldn't it be missed in vain! Sometimes the play is not over yet, but it is only a few minutes away from the end. Some people are already drawing lots. For example, if Ma Su has been executed, then there is no need to listen to Kong Ming's crying.

In short, not hindering the freedom of the public is true freedom.

### Performing French Famous Play Gold and Silver World

— Zihong

This year can be said to be the peak year of popular drama and improved local drama.

Green Treasure, the vanguard of popular drama, is still alive and well. In three years, it has continuously performed 250 different dramas, which is truly a great achievement in the drama world.

Green Treasure's audience is a follower of Molière of France, and most of them like to watch light and humorous satirical dramas. With the help of Zhang Xunzi and Zhao Yanshi, bold and drastic adaptations of famous plays have been made into complete colors, such as The Ideal Wife changed to Worried by Self-Disturbance, Drunken Dream, and Death changed to Wine, Sex, and Wealth, and Making Money in a Proper Way changed to Miser, which have all been universally and enthusiastically welcomed. Foreign scripts are not suitable for Chinese people's tastes, and after bold adaptations, the solid superstitious brand is broken without being attacked.

Recently, Zhao Yanshi spent two months of effort to complete the adaptation of a famous work in the French drama world, which is the opening play of the Drama Arts Society, "In the Beginning of Man," and "Gold and Silver World," starring Gu Lan Jun Bai Hong. Although this play was very famous in the past, according to the French consulate's evaluation, "It is a pity that the very good comedy was performed too seriously!" Green Treasure is determined to grasp the theme and overcome this point according to this evaluation, and the play is named "Gold and Silver World" for a large-scale performance.

The final decision for the new golden actors is Ma Lianliang, Li Yuru, Ye Sheng Lan, Ma Fulu, etc., who are allowed to go south to perform after Ji Yuliang's term expires.

Xiaosheng Yu Zhenfei has returned to Suzhou to marry his niece and has arrived in Shanghai. He is still working with Golden and will perform on stage at the same time as Ma Lianliang and others.

The new actors Chen Hongsheng and Chen Guilan of Tianchan Theater debuted last night with good results. Many ticket buyers went to support the show. The theater has abolished the table system, changed to assigned seating, and hired female staff, which can be said to be completely new and has changed the old look.

The updated scriptwriting committee held a meeting yesterday and decided to add the festival play Cowherd and Weaver Girl from the 29th.

The second edition of my new play at the Gongtai Theater will be performed after "Cowherd and Weaver Girl."

### Letter

To the esteemed editor: I have read a message in your journal the other day, "The Shanghai Opera School was originally prepared to sing a twelve-day daily show at the Tianchan Theater, but because of the golden actors, it has been abandoned. After Ji Yuliang's term expires, the school will take over the backstage night show." After checking, there was no such negotiation as the school prepared to sing a twelve-day daily show at the Tianchan Theater, which is presumably a misrepresentation. The school sings daily shows at Golden every Wednesday and Saturday, which is a long-term schedule. Whenever the Beijing actors' term expires, the school will take over the night show for a short period of time, which is also a common occurrence, but all are agreed upon temporarily. I am deeply afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth, so I have sent a special letter to correct it. I hope you will investigate and publish this letter on the news, which is very much desired. Sincerely, Yellow Xianzhong, Vice President of Shanghai Drama School.

Chapter 15: Where Does the Powerful Family Forcefully Take Her Away?

Yuan Yuan's adoptive mother sighed and said to Yuan Yuan, "I have been with you for a long time, and you are no different from my own daughter to me. The relationship between mother and daughter is very deep, so although there are many people outside who want to marry you back, I always feel reluctant to separate from you and am not willing to agree easily. Now I can't make the decision." As Yuan Yuan listened, her heart was beating faster and faster. She quickly said, "What is Mother saying? I don't understand. Why can't Mother make the decision?" The adoptive mother said, "Let me tell you the truth, it's that State Father Tian who came here because of your reputation. He drank two rounds of wine here. I don't know what kind of fate it is. Although he is old, his heart is not old. He loves your unparalleled beauty, so he wants to redeem you and take you to Beijing to serve him in his daily life. He is willing to pay any price, and he insists that I agree..." Before the adoptive mother finished speaking, Yuan Yuan was as if struck by lightning. Her whole body trembled involuntarily, and she let out a cry of "Ouch" from her cherry lips. She stared at her adoptive mother and leaned her hands on the table, standing up and asking, "Tian Hongyu, that old... old man, really has intentions for me? Then have you agreed to them? When did you tell them? Why didn't you tell me last night? How strange, how strange!" Yuan Yuan was still a little doubtful at this time, and her heart seemed to be going up and down. The adoptive mother sighed and said, "You can't blame me. Gao Gongzi and I talked about this matter downstairs yesterday afternoon. He said that he was ordered by State Father Tian to come here to act as a matchmaker, asking me how much money I wanted for your price, and he was prepared to redeem you. At that time, I said that I must discuss it with you before I can reply. He then said that this matter only requires me to make the decision, and I am not allowed to discuss it with you, nor am I allowed to tell you yesterday. He must have me agree. He also said that if I don't agree, I will anger the State Father, and he can immediately order the officials to seal my door and force me to hand you over, and I won't get a penny. He used such a great force to oppress me, so I had no choice but to agree. Eight thousand taels of silver is what they promised me, and I didn't dare to ask for too much. You must know how reluctant I am to be separated from you one day!" (147)
