### Major Counteroffensive by Chinese Troops in Northern Hunan; Main Force of Japanese Advance in the South Checked; Japanese Vanguard Invading Miluo Area Annihilated; Chinese Troops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi Adopt Offensive to Restrain Japanese Army

Chongqing – The war situation in Hunan Province is still critical, with very little news coming from the Chinese side. Meanwhile, Chinese troops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces have simultaneously launched offensives, striving to restrain the Japanese forces. According to Chinese communiqués, battles are still ongoing in Pingjiang and on the north bank of the Miluo River. Chinese troops are currently exerting pressure on the flanks of the Japanese army in that area. However, there is no mention of the situation near Weisha. Japanese troops in Guangzhou are currently attacking northwards along the river, with reports of fighting near Gaohewei (transliteration). Chinese troops in Zhejiang Province are also advancing on Xikou and Shaoxing. Chinese troops in southern Anhui are currently dismantling the railway north of Wanzhi. Chinese troops in Jiangxi Province are attacking near Pengze, Hukou, and Nanchang. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing – The war situation on the outskirts of Changsha has shown a turning point. The advance of the Japanese central route has been very slow. The western route landed at Lulintan and is operating southwards west of Xiangyin, but reports are scarce. The eastern route appears to be the main force, having advanced beyond Pianzhao and Gaoqiao. However, after the arrival of substantial Chinese reinforcements, a major counteroffensive was launched yesterday, with fierce fighting throughout the day. The Japanese troops have been forced back to the Jinpian area, but this news has not yet been officially reported. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing – The fierce fighting in northern Hunan continued unabated yesterday. Chinese troops launched a fierce counteroffensive along the Miluo River's southern line of Pingjiang, Jinjing, Wengjiang, Shahe, and Fulinpu, effectively checking the main force of the Japanese army. At the same time, Chinese troops north of the Miluo River, reinforced by a large army, are also launching a full-scale counteroffensive to mop up the Japanese rear. Casualties on both sides along the Miluo River are heavy. The Japanese vanguard that invaded the Miluo area has been completely annihilated. Japanese troops who forcibly landed at Yingtian on the southeastern shore of Dongting Lake and at Xijiangkou west of Lulintan have been repelled. It is reported that the Japanese army, facing strong resistance in its advance and with the Chinese army launching a general offensive in its rear, is deeply concerned about the risk of its retreat being cut off. Currently, Chinese troops have formed a fire net north of Changsha, and Changsha is implementing a scorched earth policy, preparing to fight the Japanese to the death. The Chinese troops defending Changsha number 300,000. (Dispatch, 27th)

Chongqing – Chinese military dispatches recently stated that Chinese troops are launching countless determined counteroffensives against the front, rear, and flanks of the Japanese army in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui to counter the Japanese offensive in northern Hunan, with the aim of dispersing Japanese forces and preventing them from reinforcing northern Hunan. Chinese war commentators believe that the situation in Changsha is serious but not hopeless. They declare that the situation has improved since the counteroffensive began. They point out that if Chinese troops can cut off the Japanese vanguard, Changsha can be defended. Frontline news from Chinese troops states that the battle in 1939 to drive the Japanese army back around Changsha is now being replayed in northern Hunan. The Japanese army is also relying on the tactics used in its previous attacks on Changsha and is using aircraft to transport supplies to the front lines. Chinese troops have attacked Japanese troops in many areas of eastern China. Chinese troops in northern Jiangxi are attacking Pengze and Hukou and other places near Nanchang on the south bank of the Huayangzi (Yangtze) River. Chinese troops in Zhejiang Province are also attacking various strongholds along the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, such as Yuyao and Shaoxing. Chiang Kai-shek's hometown, Kouye, has been recovered. Chinese troops are also attacking Japanese troops in the Wu-Chao area and the Taihu Lake region. (United Press dispatch, 27th)

### Fourteen American Cargo Ships Launched Yesterday in a Group; Roosevelt Reaffirms Freedom of the Seas; Two American Destroyers Also Undergo Sea Trials

United Press, Washington, 27th – Fourteen of the 312 American-built emergency liberty cargo ships were launched today. President Roosevelt also delivered a speech, rebuking Americans who spread fear, and said that these cargo ships will sail the seas as they wish. The President reiterated that all forces will be used to protect these ships and said that the construction and sailing of these ships will show the aggressors that American democracy and freedom will never perish. The President guaranteed freedom to the world. The fourteen specially constructed cargo ships were launched simultaneously this morning on both coasts. This is the first and largest group launch since World War I. These ships are specially constructed, difficult to be hit by torpedoes, and can be built very quickly. The President said, "The new shipbuilding program is our response to the aggressors who will strike at our freedom. American democracy or freedom will not perish. The whole world should have freedom, and freedom should last forever. This is what we seek, and this is our guarantee to all mankind."

Reuters, Washington, 27th – From dawn to dusk today, a total of fourteen new cargo ships were launched in shipyards along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts of the United States. President Roosevelt sent a telegram to congratulate the shipyards, solemnly expressing the government's intention to protect North American merchant ships from being hit by torpedoes, shells, or bombs. Because today is the first launching ceremony of the Maritime Commission's great cargo ship building program, it has been designated as "Liberty Fleet Memorial Day." The design of these cargo ships is uniform, 441 feet 6 inches long, 57 feet wide, and has a displacement of 14,100 tons. They can carry 9,146 tons of general cargo and have a speed of 11 nautical miles per hour. A total of 312 ships have been ordered, of which 112 will be delivered to the United Kingdom under the Lend-Lease Act. According to the current shipbuilding program of the Maritime Commission, it is expected that 1,400 merchant ships will be completed by the end of 1943. President Roosevelt's goal of two ships per day is expected to be achieved by next spring.

Reuters, Washington, 27th – Land, Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission, said last night, regarding the progress of the U.S.'s accelerated construction of merchant ships, that we all know that more merchant ships must be built to transport the necessary supplies to defeat the aggressor countries that threaten the freedom of people around the world. Since the President called on Americans to do their best, American shipbuilders have achieved something that the Maritime Commission can be proud of in this initial effort. Robin Sen of the Naval Department's Shipping Division also said that the launching of American merchant ships should silence those who criticized the United States for neglecting national defense since 1919, resulting in it lagging far behind in international competition, and that it would be useless to try to catch up now. U.S. Military Supply Chief Gregory referred to U.S. overseas bases as outposts of democracy.

Reuters, Kearney, New Jersey, 27th – The American destroyers Hamilton and Rodman, whose keels were laid on December 16th of last year by the Federal Shipbuilding Company, have now been launched for sea trials.

Editorial

### Britain Should Launch an Immediate Attack

After the Nazi army achieved a partial victory in Kiev, it immediately advanced two heavy troops towards Kharkov and the Crimean Peninsula, so that one side could complete the control of the entire Ukraine, and the other side could prepare to invade the oil fields of the Caucasus. At the same time, the German army in the north also stepped up its attack on Leningrad. According to the German side, the capture of the city is imminent. Although the gain or loss of Leningrad or the crisis in Crimea is not enough to become a decisive factor in the German-Soviet war, in order to timely restrain the German military strength and prevent it from continuing to plunder war resources in the Soviet Union, Britain has an absolute necessity to launch a counterattack on all fronts immediately, whether based on aiding the Soviet Union or on self-defense.

Hitler was originally an expert in aggression. During the war against the Soviet Union, he never neglected the necessary arrangements for other aspects. The intensified attacks on American ships during the US-Japan talks have fully proved that although he is fully dealing with the Eastern Front war, he has not forgotten to "cheer" for his Far East allies on the Western Front. These days, with the development of the war in Ukraine, his military position has made significant progress. Of course, he has more energy to take care of other aspects and arrange new actions. According to recent telegrams, his targets of activity are at least three: (1) Inciting Bulgaria to declare war on the Soviet Union, while at the same time pressuring Turkey to allow German troops to pass through, so that one side can join forces with the German forces on the Crimean front to attack the Caucasus, and the other side can further invade Iran to cut off the contact line between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Near East; (2) Sending reinforcements to North African Libya together with Italy, in preparation for launching an offensive towards Egypt again when necessary; (3) Taking advantage of the breathing opportunity after a small victory on the Eastern Front. He turned around and re-oppressed Vichy; in order to realize the long-held dream of "Franco-German military cooperation", in other words, he demanded to use French African ports (especially Dakar) and the remaining French fleet to threaten Britain and the United States.

The above three activities, although seemingly unrelated in form, are actually closely linked. For example, if Turkey succumbs, not only will the Black Sea basin be prone to drastic changes, but also the countries in the Near East will be affected. At that time, the German-Italian coalition forces in Libya will naturally take the opportunity to advance eastward, in order to contain the main force of the British Middle East Army preparing to go north to aid the Soviet Union, this is the first; if Vichy also succumbs, and puts Bizerte, Casablanca, and even Dakar into the use of the German army, then the power of the Axis powers in Africa and the Mediterranean will gradually expand, and its threat to Britain and the United States will inevitably increase immediately, and the result will inevitably affect the Soviet Red Army's protracted war, this is the second. Undoubtedly, if Bizerte is used by the German side, the Axis' military transport to North Africa only needs to go directly from Sicily to the port, with only a narrow strip of water in between, which will make Britain's blockade in the Mediterranean ineffective. As for Dakar becoming a German naval and air base, it will further hinder the transport line of the United States supplying the Near East and the Soviet Union.

From this, it can be seen that Hitler's various arrangements other than the war against the Soviet Union are very vicious. As long as he succeeds in one place, it will be enough to cause extremely unfavorable consequences for the military and diplomacy of the democratic front. Therefore, for the sake of preparedness, the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the United Kingdom, which has allied with the Soviet Union and has the obligation to fight side by side, must strive for the initiative in every possible future battlefield as early as possible and should never let Hitler gain the upper hand again. According to yesterday's news, Britain and the United States have supplied Turkey with aircraft and war equipment, and it is also reported that British General Wavell has formed an expeditionary force in Iran, preparing to assist the Red Army in defending the Caucasus: Although these two statements can give people some comfort and prove to some extent that Britain is preparing to take action, no matter what, it is still too slow and gives people the impression of digging a well when thirsty. In fact, the Soviet Union has been fighting independently for more than three months, no matter how difficult the US supply is, no matter how lacking the British preparation is, it seems that there should be no other action besides some limited supply to directly contain the Nazi war plan and disperse its forces. If we must wait until the Red Army continues to suffer some setbacks, so that the war affects the Near East or other aspects, and then discuss remedial measures, wouldn't we have to repeat the past mistakes of losing the Balkans? Therefore, our first hope is that the three-nation conference to be held in Moscow in the coming days can pay special attention to the determination and implementation of joint combat plans in addition to discussing the issue of material supply. It is even more hoped that the British government can make decisive decisions and swiftly seize the opportunity, and never let the anti-aggression front of the world relive the painful experience of the democratic countries being defeated one by one in the past.

### Bank of England Governor Leads Mission to China: Undertakes Major Economic Task, U.S. Representative Hoakland Accompanies

Reuters, London, 27th – At the request of the central government and the invitation of the Chinese government, Bank of England Governor Niemeyer has now assumed a mission to China concerning finance and economy. Niemeyer recently conferred with U.S. authorities in Washington. Kirkand, a technical assistant to the U.S. Treasury Secretary, will accompany Niemeyer to China. In addition, Baxter, the financial advisor to the Burmese government, will also be traveling with them. It is said that Generalissimo Chiang had previously suggested to the British that the best way for Britain to assist China was to send an economic mission to China. The British government is now taking this action, and the selection of Bank of England Governor Niemeyer as the representative demonstrates the importance it attaches to this matter. Kirkand's accompaniment of Niemeyer can be seen as another clear demonstration of close cooperation between Britain and the United States on the issue of aid to China.

United Press, London, 17th – It was announced here yesterday that the British government, at the invitation of China, is sending Sir Niemeyer to Chongqing to undertake economic and financial tasks. This determined mission is the ninth undertaken by Sir Niemeyer in various countries over the past ten years, including Australia, New Zealand, India, Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Egypt, and Greece.

Reuters, London, 27th – The Times diplomatic correspondent stated that Sir Niemeyer's led British delegation to China is due to a previous proposal by General Chiang Kai-shek that one of the best ways for Britain to assist China would be to send an economic delegation to China. The British side's selection of an official like Niemeyer to undertake this matter shows the British government's commitment to fulfilling its promise to assist China's financial position in every possible way.

### British Aid China Committee Writes to U.S. President: Requests Announcement of Content of Talks with Japan, Declares No Harm to Chinese Interests

United Press, London, 27th – Many prominent figures in Britain yesterday wrote to U.S. Ambassador Winant, expressing their unease about the U.S.-Japan talks. The letter, under the name of the "Aid China Movement Committee," signed by prominent figures such as Welles, Blissley, and Laski, requested that the letter be forwarded to President Roosevelt. The letter stated, "The people are entirely uninformed about the content of President Roosevelt's talks with General Nomura (Japanese Ambassador to Washington), which is bound to give rise to all sorts of rumors that some decisions detrimental to the Chinese people have already been made. Today, all friends of China are aware of your fear in Chongqing. Their unease has not been relieved by the statements that there has been no change in American policy towards China, or even by statements from respected speakers such as Mr. Hull (Secretary of State). Given that Japan has always seen negotiations as an opportunity to propagate aggression and strengthen its forces for further attacks, we believe that a clear statement at this time would be very beneficial and would not create suspicion and conjecture. This statement should state that any agreement with Japan that is detrimental to China has not been considered."

### Japanese Emperor Receives Konoe and Toyoda: Ito Broadcast the Night Before, Adhering to Axis Policy

United Press, Tokyo, 27th – The Japanese Emperor received Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Toyoda yesterday.

United Press, Tokyo, 10th – Konoe visited Hiranuma today. Domei News Agency claimed it was to discuss important matters.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 27th – Dr. Ito, Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, in a broadcast speech last night commemorating the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact, stated roughly that, no matter how the international situation changes and no matter what difficulties Japan encounters, one fact will never change: Japan's foreign policy will be centered on the spirit of the Tripartite Pact. Any attempts by third countries to sow discord among the allies of the Tripartite Pact will never succeed. In last year's letter from the Japanese Emperor, it was stated that the Tripartite Pact was a tool for resolving disputes and rebuilding peace. Prime Minister Konoe's letter also expressed the same spirit, stating that Japan's foreign policy is based on this. This pact is different from previous military alliances, and its purpose is not to prolong the war to gain benefits, but to reduce the threat of war and establish world peace. If there are countries that oppose Japan's efforts to achieve its goals in East Asia, then Japan's cooperation with Germany and Italy is a natural course of action. Over the past year, Germany and Italy have achieved great results in the new order. Japan's tough stance in the Far East has contributed greatly to the Axis powers, and there have also been successes in the Far East. Japan must use all peaceful methods to comply with the spirit of the pact, such as mediating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and signing a defense treaty between Japan and Vietnam. If there is any obstruction from a third country, Japan must resolutely move forward to achieve a new world order.

United Press, Tokyo, 27th – Army Minister Tojo and Army Chief of Staff Sugiyama sent telegrams to Hitler and Mussolini yesterday to congratulate them on the anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact.

### Prospects for Japan-U.S. Relations are Bleak: Recent Remarks from Tokyo Cause No Anxiety in Washington

Reuters, Washington, 27th – Those appeasers and shallow thinkers who have recently predicted that Japan will change its mentality and that Tokyo will develop sincerity in improving relations with the United States, seem to have received their answer from Tokyo yesterday. The remarks made by Ito, Director of the Cabinet Planning Board, Mabuchi, spokesman for the Japanese Army, and Ishii, spokesman for the Information Bureau, were given significant attention by the newspapers yesterday afternoon. According to observers here, judging from these remarks, it is impossible to say that Japan's international position has changed in any way. Well-informed sources in Washington have long expected that Japan has no other choice but to adhere to the Axis powers, because if it were to break away from the Axis powers, Japan's diplomatic position would be weakened, which would be tantamount to admitting diplomatic failure. Now that Tokyo has made these remarks, the hope for a compromise between Japan and the United States, which shallow thinkers had hoped for in recent weeks, has vanished. However, Japan's pursuit of the Axis powers will only lead to diplomatic isolation. If it joins the Axis war, it will be even more isolated militarily. Therefore, Japan is bound to be extremely enthusiastic about colluding with the Axis powers. In summary, Japan's position is seen by people here as neither pleasant nor enviable. Even in the present, it is unlikely that this position will improve in time. Japan's continued fighting in China, and now its large-scale offensive in Hunan Province, is just the right way to quickly exhaust all its raw materials. These raw materials cannot be supplied by the United States, nor can they be obtained from the British Empire. Therefore, the various remarks made by Japanese spokesmen yesterday, reaffirming their intention to adhere to the Axis powers, have caused no anxiety here.

### Germany, Italy, and Japan Sign Pact: First Anniversary, Japan Issues Simple Communiqué, Avoids Mentioning Britain and the United States

United Press, Tokyo, 27th – Japan's commemoration of the first anniversary of the Tripartite Pact today was not enthusiastic. The official communiqué issued was simple and lukewarm. Ambassador Hess delivered a long communiqué, calling for Axis unity and specifically stating the unreliability of Britain and the United States. He also explained in detail the reasons for Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union. Few German flags were hung in Tokyo, but many Japanese flags were hung. Japan's official communiqué was very careful to avoid mentioning Britain and the United States. The gist of the communiqué was that Japan hopes to maintain peace and is willing to make further sacrifices to establish a new order in East Asia. Squadrons of army bombers flew over the city, apparently as part of the commemorative ceremonies. Konoe sent congratulatory messages to Hitler and Mussolini, and Foreign Minister Toyoda also sent congratulatory messages to the German and Italian Foreign Ministers. Matsuoka, the former Foreign Minister who was responsible for Japan's adherence to the pact, also addressed the German and Italian Ambassadors here yesterday, reiterating that his confidence in the pact remains unchanged.

Reuters, Tokyo, 27th – This afternoon, Foreign Minister Toyoda hosted a banquet for the representatives of the Axis powers to celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Alliance. In his address, he stated that the efforts of Germany and Italy in Europe and Japan in East Asia to build a new order are currently encountering many difficulties. Today, it depends on mutual cooperation, trust, and perseverance to implement the mission of the pact. The pact has achieved great success, but there are also many difficulties. Each signatory country should reaffirm its determination to overcome any difficulties that hinder the implementation of the pact's mission. Among those present at the banquet were the German and Italian Ambassadors.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 27th – Schmid, Director of the German Foreign Ministry's Information Department, hosted foreign guests on the first anniversary of the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Alliance. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a welcome speech. Those present included the Italian and Japanese Ambassadors, the Ministers of Hungary, Romania, and other countries, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force attachés.

### Kuo Ping-wen's Speech in England: China's Unlimited Resources Sufficient to Benefit the World

Reuters, London, 27th – Kuo Ping-wen, Vice Minister of Finance of China, stated in a speech at a meeting of the Women's Association yesterday that the Japanese army and air force specialized in destroying Chinese educational institutions during the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, resulting in the destruction of many schools and temporarily hindering China's movement to promote science. However, after four years of war, the quality of Chinese educational institutions has improved. China is currently still an agricultural country, and its natural resources are largely undeveloped. If scientific methods are applied, many times more raw materials can be produced and shared with the world. However, if China is controlled by an aggressor nation and other countries are not allowed to intervene, then this will be impossible.

### Japanese Suddenly Arrest Chinese and Vietnamese People in Hanoi and Haiphong: French Authorities Consider it a Violation of Sovereignty, Submit Strong Protest to Japan

Havas News Agency, Hanoi, 26th – An official communiqué recently released stated, "On the night of the 25th of this month, without prior notification, Japanese troops set up barbed wire, conducted searches, and arrested more than a hundred Chinese and Annamese people. The French authorities consider the actions of the Japanese troops to be a violation of French sovereignty, and the Japanese government has solemnly guaranteed respect for French sovereignty in all agreements signed with the French government. Therefore, a strong protest has been lodged with the Japanese side."

Reuters, Hanoi, 27th – Without notifying the French authorities, Japanese military police suddenly set up obstacles and established security lines on the streets of Hanoi and Haiphong on the night of the 25th and the morning of the 26th, and began searching private homes and hotels, detaining hundreds of Chinese and Vietnamese people, accusing them of participating in political activities in Chongqing. The French side is now lodging a strong protest, considering this action to be a deliberate act of undermining the solemn commitment to respect French sovereignty in the Franco-Japanese agreements.

### Testing Army Combat Effectiveness: U.S. Recruits Hold Exercises, Government Will Request Armed Merchant Ships

Havas News Agency, New York, 27th – Whether the combat power of the U.S. Army today is equal to or has increased compared to the expeditionary force sent to France to assist in the First European War is a question of considerable interest. In light of this, the military authorities of Louisiana divided the new recruits into attacking and defending teams to conduct exercises for several days, with the ultimate goal of the defending forces repelling the attacking forces, in order to test their combat effectiveness. As of now, although the full results have not yet been announced, observers generally believe, based on preliminary results, that the equipment of the U.S. Army has improved and that its strength is clearly stronger than during the First European War. General Knoll, who presided over the exercises, stated, "The more training our soldiers receive, the better, because the greatest weakness of the U.S. Army is a lack of training."

Havas, New York, 26th – Political figures here recently stated that the U.S. government does not intend to ask the Senate and House of Representatives to immediately and completely abolish the Neutrality Act, but only intends to ask the two houses to add a clause allowing the government to arm American merchant ships, and hopes that the two houses will not have lengthy discussions, but will be able to quickly reach a satisfactory resolution on the important points. In general, this case will be proposed by Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Even isolationist congressmen admit that they are unable to express opposition to this proposal. Internationalists believe that the current Neutrality Act is fundamentally no longer adapted to the needs of the international situation, but are able to accept transitional measures in principle, pending changes in the international situation that require the government to adopt a strict stance without causing opposition from the isolationists, before taking further action. Based on this, it appears that Senator McKellar's proposal to abolish the Neutrality Act was not agreed upon by the government in advance. It is expected that the two houses will soon express agreement on the government's proposal to arm American merchant ships, but it has already aroused controversy in various quarters. According to reports, U.S. President Wilson, 21 days after ordering the arming of American merchant ships, asked the two houses to declare war on Germany. The famous political commentator Sims published an article in the Howard newspapers today, discussing this matter, believing that this matter is of great importance and that history may well repeat itself.

Reuters, Washington, 27th – Secretary of the Navy Knox recently published an article in a foreign business weekly, stating that the United States is now at the gateway to the Second World War. We must take all necessary measures to protect our commerce and the lives of our merchant sailors from being destroyed by pirate ships. We must move forward on both fronts: detecting enemy pirate ships and escorting our own ships.

### Full Text of Soviet Ambassador's Speech at Allied Conference

Tass, London, 27th – At the Allied Conference on the 24th, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky delivered a speech, the full text of which is as follows: The convening of this conference coincides with the autumn when Hitler's Germany is attacking the Soviet Union with particular force after enslaving and trampling on several European countries. It has now been three months since Nazi Germany treacherously invaded Soviet territory. During this period, the Soviet people and the heroic Navy, Red Army, and Air Force have been fighting the evil enemy continuously, shouldering the most important task of fighting the brutal enemy, because the brutal enemy is threatening the social and political achievements of all freedom-loving nations and endangering the foundations of culture. In this war, which Hitler forced the democratic countries to participate in, the future destiny of Europe and all mankind will be decided.

The Nazi threat to freedom-loving nations, claiming to be the master race, continues to destroy cities and towns, turning prosperous lands into deserts. At the same time, it is willing to sacrifice countless lives in an attempt to rule the world. All of this is intolerable to us. The only task for all countries forced to fight Germany is to ensure that Hitler's Germany suffers a swift and decisive defeat. In order to achieve this task, all countries must go all out. The Allied countries are convening this conference to discuss the implementation of this task. In addition, another task of this conference is to lay the foundation for the organization of international relations and to plan post-war measures to ensure that we are never again poisoned by Nazism, which runs counter to human culture. The Soviet Union is confident that this task can be successfully implemented. At the same time, after Hitlerism is completely defeated, a solid foundation for international cooperation and friendship can be established, in line with the will and ideals of freedom-loving nations. This is the goal of the Soviet people's struggle, and it is also the basis of the Soviet government's activities and foreign policy.

Both in the past and at present, the principle of Soviet foreign policy is to respect the sovereignty and national self-determination of all countries. The Soviet Union's relations with all ethnic groups within the country are also based on this principle. Indeed, this principle is the cornerstone of the Soviet political system. Therefore, the Soviet Union strives to safeguard the independence and territorial integrity of all countries. As for what kind of social order and what kind of government system each country should build in order to achieve economic and cultural prosperity, the Soviet Union believes that all countries have the right to self-determination, and the Soviet Union will strive to safeguard it. Whether in policy or in relations with other countries, the Soviet Union fully follows this principle, resolutely opposes all actions that undermine the sovereignty of other countries, and denounces aggression, aggressors, and attempts to force other countries into war. The Soviet Union firmly advocates collective action against aggressors and believes that collective action against aggression is the only effective way to realize the above principles and establish security and peace for all countries. In addition to striving to safeguard all freedom-loving nations, the Soviet Union is also working hard on disarmament. The Soviet Union will resolutely strike at aggressors. At the same time, Soviet foreign policy remains to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with all countries that respect Soviet sovereignty. In order to follow the above policies, the Soviet government fully agrees with the principles in the declaration of U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill, and these principles are extremely important in the current international situation.

The Soviet government recently stated that the implementation of these principles will receive the assistance of the Soviet people and the government. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it must solemnly state that the common task of all countries is anti-Hitlerism. This task is to mobilize all the forces of freedom-loving countries and strive to liberate the people who are groaning under the iron heel of the Hitler bandits. The issue of the average distribution of post-war food and all resources is extremely important. The Soviet government believes that the most urgent task at present is to accurately distribute economic resources and war supplies so that the European nations enslaved by Hitler can be liberated as soon as possible.

### Soviet Union Offers Practical Suggestions for Organizing Representative Conference

Tass, London, 27th – At the Allied Conference, it was suggested that practical steps be drafted to supply the European countries with various necessities after the defeat of Hitler's Germany. The draft has six clauses, clarifying the common goals of the Allied countries, namely, to ensure that countries released from Nazi pressure after the war are supplied with food, raw materials, and essential necessities. The draft also stipulates the strategies and methods of activities of the Allied governments to achieve common goals. The sixth item of the draft is about the establishment of a central bureau of the British government, which serves as a mechanism for the Allied countries to discuss various needs together and is responsible for submitting various suggestions to the Allied Representative Conference (chaired by Litz). Regarding the draft, Maisky declared that the Soviet government does not object to and is prepared to accept the first to the first article. As for the sixth, the Soviet Union has no objection to considering the principles, but the most important thing is that the central bureau mentioned in the clause must have an allied organization, including representatives of all governments, with equal status. In order to achieve this goal, the Allied governments should be consulted on issues such as the organization, scope, and working methods of this bureau, so that a decision can be made at the next Allied Conference. Eden said that the Soviet government's proposal could be studied and that there was no reason why the scope of work of the bureau could not be changed or expanded in accordance with the opinions of the Allied governments. Well-informed sources pointed out that, except for the sixth article, which will be discussed due to the Soviet government's proposal, the rest can be considered to have been passed, because the representatives have accepted the first five articles in their speeches.

### Red Army Fights Fiercely on Entire Front: Defends Key Soviet Industrial Areas, 118 German Planes Destroyed, German Troops Landing on Hanko Island Annihilated

Tass, Moscow, 27th – The Soviet Information Bureau issued a war report stating, "On the 26th, our army and the enemy fought along the entire front. Our air force shot down 118 enemy planes, and we also lost 29 planes."

United Press, New York, 27th – Yesterday, according to news from both German and Soviet sources, Soviet troops put up strong resistance along the crucial front to protect the key industrial areas. Fierce fighting continued in the Crimea and Leningrad areas. News from Moscow, Berlin, and London all indicated that there was no change in the front line in Leningrad. The Nazi troops have been blocked 15 to 20 miles from the city. Elderly men and women and schoolchildren in Leningrad are reportedly being mobilized to put out Nazi incendiary bombs. Reports indicate that Soviet troops have repelled the initial German offensive in Crimea, destroying Nazi paratroopers, tanks, mechanized units, infantry, artillery, planes, etc. Several German troops were blown up by landmines in the area. It is heard here that Moscow radio reports that there is heavy rain in all areas of the German-Soviet front. Moscow quoted German sources as saying that 500,000 Soviet troops were captured east of Kiev. Radio reports that fierce fighting continues on the Kiev front, as the German troops are extremely numerous. Moscow claims that the Red Army has defeated German troops near Vorskla, who were trying to cut off the Moscow-Kharkov railway line.

Reuters, London, 27th – Reuters military commentator said, the most notable points of the Soviet front are now focused on Leningrad in the north and the Crimean Peninsula in the south. In the Leningrad area, Soviet troops not only broke the German army's efforts to advance desperately, but also succeeded in counterattacking, making some local progress in several places. Although the progress is not far, considering the fierceness of the German offensive and the intensity of the battle, the progress of the Soviet troops is a great achievement, showing that the morale of the Soviet defenders is high. The battle in the Crimea has been going on for less than 48 hours, and it is impossible to predict the outcome. It is reported that the German side, as previously expected, used paratroopers and air-transported troops to attack the Crimea. The purpose seems to be to occupy the rear Berislav line. However, the Soviet side was prepared early and will have its own countermeasures. The German side claimed to have captured a large number of Soviet prisoners east of Kiev, while admitting that the remaining Soviet troops are still fighting. What the large German troops have captured is actually Soviet civilians, and they are also considered soldiers. However, the German side did not claim that the attack on Kharkov had made continued progress. The fact that the German troops are now trying to attack the Crimea shows that their purpose is in the south and not in the center, because they do not want their right side to be threatened by the Soviet troops in the Crimea. As for the German troops in Murmansk, it seems that they have not achieved special achievements. Unofficial news also reported that the German troops in this area have been frustrated.

Havas News Agency, Moscow, 27th – According to an announcement by the Soviet Baltic Fleet authorities, all 15,000 German troops who landed on the Hanko Peninsula have been annihilated.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 27th – The Führer's headquarters issued a special communiqué last night stating that the date for the complete annihilation of the enemy troops east of Kiev is not far away. So far, the number of enemy troops captured in the area has reached 574,000 and is still increasing. Our army seized countless weapons, which have not yet been counted.

Haitong News Agency, German Führer's Headquarters, 27th – This afternoon, the German military report stated that the Battle of Kiev has ended. German troops annihilated five Soviet divisions trapped, and 665,000 Soviet troops were captured, losing 884 tanks and 3,718 artillery pieces. The German army achieved an unprecedented victory. German planes bombed armaments construction near Tula. In the Moscow area, military installations were attacked.

### Intense Fighting in the Siege of Leningrad; Red Army's Counterattack Strength Increases

Moscow, TASS, 27th – In a fierce battle in a certain district at the approaches to Leningrad, the enemy suffered 500 casualties, and our forces destroyed five German cannons, six small cannons, twenty trucks, and numerous other military equipment. In another battle zone of the city, our side captured three Fascist tanks, a small number of artillery pieces, numerous machine guns, automatic rifles, and a wireless communication station. The enemy personnel and equipment were heavily damaged.

Moscow, TASS, 27th – "Red Star" newspaper reports: "The fighting near Leningrad is becoming increasingly fierce. Our troops have not only repelled enemy offensives but also launched counterattacks from time to time, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. On the morning of September 23rd, the German army concentrated a division to launch a new offensive in one of the most important areas of Leningrad. They were met with a fierce counterattack by the Red Army, and intense Soviet artillery fire forced the enemy to retreat. Subsequently, 400 German motorcycles, under the cover of tanks, launched a second determined attack, which also failed. At noon, two German battalions launched a frontal assault, which was also unsuccessful. As a result of three German offensives, approximately 1,000 were killed or wounded. In another key area of Leningrad, the Red Army advanced southward and captured a large village, continuing to advance, crossing the V River and consolidating its positions on the opposite bank. The enemy turned every small village into a fortress, putting up a fierce resistance, but our forces continued to advance. On the 24th, our forces advanced another eight kilometers, recapturing four large villages. Yesterday, the Red Army crushed the German Fifth Infantry Regiment. Our air force is working closely with the infantry in the Leningrad area. In short, the Red Army's counterattack strength in Leningrad has become increasingly strong, and the enemy is gradually feeling unsustainable."

Berlin, Havas, 27th – Authoritative sources stated yesterday that on Thursday, German heavy artillery heavily bombarded ships in the port of Leningrad and enemy artillery positions in Kronstadt, destroying multiple naval and land heavy artillery pieces.

Berlin, Havas, 27th – It was announced here last night that German fighter planes and bomber squadrons sank nine enemy ships in Lake Ladoga on Thursday, six of which belonged to a convoy, and the rest were sunk during a Soviet landing attempt.

### New German Offensive Aims to Invade the Caucasus

London, United Press, 27th – British military experts say that German mechanized units have launched a new offensive on the southern front, attempting to infiltrate Crimea and use it as a springboard for invading the Caucasus. The German attack on the Perekop Isthmus with hundreds of tanks and mechanized units is considered one of the most intense battles of the German-Soviet war. However, it is reported that this German force has been thwarted by Soviet artillery and is still near the isthmus. It is also reported that several battalions of Nazi troops have been wiped out by landmines around the area, with no survivors. It is reported that the Soviet troops of Marshal Timoshenko, facing the German army in the north, have launched a strong counteroffensive from Kherson, reaching Perekop. Other German forces on the Dnieper River have established some bridgeheads, and it is also reported that the German army is operating with the help of aircraft. These German aircraft, assisting the land forces, are not only attacking Allied forces at Perekop but also heavily bombing the southern region of Crimea. British military experts believe that news of this fierce offensive is sufficient to prove that the Soviet resistance in the isthmus is particularly strong and is obstructing any further advance by the Nazis. Some experts point out that occupying Crimea would be at least as difficult for the Germans as capturing Crete, as the Germans have already admitted that both naval and air forces are constrained. The experts also believe that since the German army recognizes the difficulties in the naval and air aspects (the nearest German air force base is in Bulgaria), they may adopt the method of capturing Crete, such as using a large number of aircraft to transport troops, to conquer Crimea. As for the fierce fighting in Leningrad, the situation is gradually turning optimistic, partly due to Marshal Timoshenko's achievements north of Smolensk, where Soviet forces have driven the Nazis out of the upper Dvina River and recaptured strongholds on both sides of the river. It is also reported that the Soviet counteroffensive in Glukhov, between Shostka and Kyiv, has been quite successful and has threatened the German forces south of Gomel.

London, Reuters, 27th – Responsible sources here stated today that bloody battles continue along the entire Soviet front, but no details of the progress of the fighting in various areas have been received. The Soviets still hold at least part of Oesel Island. The offensive in Crimea continues, although there are widespread reports that the Germans have used paratroopers, but this has not yet been confirmed here. This year's rainfall in Ukraine is particularly early, which will have a significant impact on the fighting in the area.

### German Forces Near Odessa Suffer 50,000 Casualties in Two Weeks

Moscow, TASS, 27th – The Romanian 13th and 15th Divisions near Odessa have been reinforced and defeated again near the city. On the 24th, Soviet marines and Red Army troops, under the cover of aircraft and gunboat fire, launched a counteroffensive, resulting in 5,000 to 6,000 Romanian casualties, including 2,000 killed. In addition, our forces captured 33 artillery pieces, 110 machine guns, over 2,000 rifles, and 4,000 shells. Moscow, TASS, 27th – General Petrov wrote an article in "Izvestia" and "Pravda," describing the situation of the fighting in Odessa. The article states: "The enemy's offensive has been halted, and fierce battles are unfolding along the entire front. Although the enemy is numerous, our forces are not only conducting defensive battles but also engaging in repeated counterattacks using fortifications, which have been very successful. The enemy's losses are increasing daily. Initially, the enemy attempted to break through our lines with six to seven divisions, but they have failed. Several enemy divisions have lost as much as three-quarters of their strength, and more than half of their military equipment has been lost. According to extremely accurate statistics, from September 1st to September 15th, German and Romanian forces near Odessa have suffered 50,000 casualties, including killed, wounded, and captured. Recently, the enemy has changed its strategy due to heavy losses, often harassing in small groups, but this is also ineffective. In the past few days, the German and Romanian forces have received reinforcements and have begun to heavily bombard Odessa with artillery and aircraft. Our forces are very familiar with this tactic, so we are never moved by it and stand firm as before. The defenders of Odessa have shown great heroism and perseverance. Marines, Red Army troops, farmers, workers, and Cossack cavalry have all risen up to fight and repelled the Nazi offensive. The situation of the defenders of Odessa is indeed very difficult, but among the defenders, there are no cowards, waverers, or rumor-mongers. The defenders deeply understand the boundless strength of their country, and they also know that the battle of Odessa is of great concern to the whole world. They are determined to fight to the last drop of blood to defend this great city."

### Joint British-Soviet Military Review in Iranian Square; London Has Not Yet Confirmed the Joint Defense of the Caucasus

London, Reuters, 27th – London sources say that British and Soviet troops are closely cooperating in Iran, with absolutely no friction. The two armies have established full contact, and the relationship between the soldiers is extremely harmonious, demonstrating the absurdity of German propaganda that the two armies have serious friction. At the same time, Moscow's "Pravda" published an article describing the meeting of British and Soviet troops in Tehran on Tuesday. It is claimed that Soviet and British troops paraded opposite each other in the square, reviewed by representatives of both commanders. After the parade, they had pleasant conversations with each other and then dined together, with Soviet soldiers performing dances for entertainment before dispersing happily. British Staff Officer Brigadier Tilak said that he hoped that the joint British-Soviet action in Iran would be just the beginning of a vast action against Hitlerism. The Soviet troops in the parade included infantry, cavalry, and tank units, while the British troops included mountain infantry, motorized artillery, and cavalry units, all stationed in the suburbs of Tehran.

London, Reuters, 27th – Responsible sources here have no confirmed information regarding the rumor from Tehran that Indian British Commander-in-Chief Wavell is currently in Iran to meet with Soviet General Novikov to discuss the joint British-Soviet defense of the Caucasus. However, some form of joint action between Britain and the Soviet Union is clearly within the realm of possibility. The railway built by the former King of Iran uses British-style rails, and with the Persian Gulf now in British hands, it will not be too difficult to maintain a strong British force north of Tabriz.

### Germany Announces Closure of Iranian Embassies and Consulates

Berlin, Havas, 27th – It was announced here last night that Iranian embassies and consulates in Germany and occupied territories have been closed, and Iranian diplomats have been asked to leave the country within a few days.

### Democratic Countries Fully Support the Soviet Union; Discussions Held in London; War Materiel Transported to the Soviet Union via the Middle East

London, United Press, 27th – On the eve of the Three-Power Conference in Moscow, reliable American sources announced today that the democratic countries are prepared to meet the Soviet Union's needs for tanks, aircraft, and raw materials, and almost completely meet its extensive requirements. Therefore, Britain and the United States have immediately begun to jointly transport hundreds of aircraft and tanks to the Soviet Union each month. The democratic countries have also promised to supply a large amount of raw materials to the Soviet Union's war machine. Valuable items such as lead, which the democratic countries themselves—especially Britain—also lack, will also be supplied to the Soviet Union. It is expected that the United States will also supply the Soviet Union with certain types of steel and ordnance. It is reported that the democratic countries will assure Moscow that they will supply other items such as rubber, tin, cotton, wool, jute, and shellac.

London, Reuters, 27th – After General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, recently visited London, Minister of State Lord Lyttelton has now arrived in London from the Middle East to discuss matters with cabinet members. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent said that this is Lyttelton's first visit to Beijing since he took office as Minister of State three months ago. It is widely believed that his trip is related to the transportation of war materiel to the Soviet Union via the Middle East and other matters.

London, Reuters, 27th – According to British Sisco's radio message today, Sir Roland Smith, Permanent Secretary of the British Aircraft Production Department, has been appointed as a supplementary member of the British delegation attending the Three-Power Conference in that city. Brigadier General Bright of the US delegation will also be replaced by Brigadier General Chaney.

### Soviet Union Formally Recognizes the French National Committee; Maisky and de Gaulle Exchange Letters; Mutual Assistance Expressed to Fight the Enemy Together

London, Reuters, 27th – The Soviet Union has officially recognized the Free French National Committee. Yesterday afternoon, Soviet Ambassador Maisky exchanged letters with Free French leader de Gaulle at his embassy. The Soviet Union's letter to the Free French stated: The Soviet Union recognizes de Gaulle as the leader of the Free French and is prepared to handle all matters related to cooperation with the Free French with the French National Defense Committee. The Soviet Union is willing to assist the Free French in continuing to resist the enemy and wishes to take this opportunity to express its determination to restore France's independence and greatness after defeating the common enemy. De Gaulle's reply expressed thanks and stated that the Free French will continue to fight in the Soviet Union and Allied countries until the common enemy is completely defeated. The Free French are willing to do everything in their power to assist the Soviet Union's struggle.

### Yarn and Cotton

### Nanyang Demand for Yarn Continues; Mixed-Brand Yarn Sharply Increases; Soars by a Huge Amount of Seventy to Eighty Yuan in Two Days; Double-Horse Hovering Around 1,800 Yuan

The yarn market continues to advance, but the inflationary trend is still moderate. However, the current situation is very good, due to the continued demand from Nanyang, resulting in the spot supply failing to meet demand. The inflationary trend of mixed-brand yarn is extremely sharp, making people excited. However, the Double-Horse factory's price is relatively peaceful due to the heavy pressure of a large short position. However, ten-count coarse yarn and twenty-count mixed-brand yarn have increased by seventy to eighty yuan in two days. Twenty-count Double-Horse yarn had a high price of 1,804 yuan, a low price of 1,792 yuan, and a closing price of 1,802 yuan. Due to the usual weekend market closure in the afternoon, some said that transactions were still made at 1,802-3 yuan after the closing, followed by further transactions at 1,798-9 yuan. Currently, according to market sources, the yarn market has not been very good, because some of the former bulls are said to be turning bearish again, but the situation is extremely complex, and outsiders find it difficult to understand.

The Double-Horse morning market opened relatively tight, with the first transaction at 1,797 yuan, rising to 98 yuan. Subsequently, profit-takers exited, causing it to fall to 1,792 yuan. At 9:30, the exchange opened higher, and with spot market conditions firm, sentiment remained tight. However, Double-Horse hovered between 1,795-6 yuan for a long time. Afterwards, it was heard that spot supply was quite tight, and buying picked up again, suddenly jumping over the 1,800 yuan mark to 1,804 yuan. However, as soon as the new price appeared, selling also increased, hovering at 02-3 yuan for a long time, then falling back to 1,796 yuan. By closing, some bought in, rising again to close at 1,802 yuan. A total of 11,790 bales were traded today. The amount sold by each group is listed below:

Fellow Traders 2,000 bales   Nanyang 190 bales

Hong Kong 600 bales  Total: 2,790 bales

The Double-Horse futures market is booming and continues to rise steadily. Its stability is a recent outstanding record. However, in reality, its trend is that people are inevitably wary due to the lack of special prospects abroad. The biggest factor for the firm reliance of buyers is that mixed-brand spot traders are slightly active. Therefore, the factory's orders, after being raised by large players, reach new high prices one after another, and have even broken through the 1,800 yuan mark at closing. Stimulated by this, futures yarn pushed prices up sharply, and short covering also followed. Although trading in the market was not very active, buyers were strong. The October contract opened high at 1,685 yuan, the November contract opened at 1,690 yuan, and then rose to 1,694 yuan. The December contract initially traded at 1,728 yuan, then saw a high of 1,735 yuan. Although there was some fluctuation afterwards, the stability was extremely firm. As a result, the near-term contract closed at 1,683.5 yuan, the November contract at 1,693.5 yuan, and the December contract at 1,732 yuan, each rising by 7 to 8.5 yuan. A table of the market prices is listed below.

### Spot Cotton Hidden Away; No Transactions

Spot cotton trading has suddenly come to a standstill. Because market prices have been rising recently, and inventories have gradually become scarce and expensive, fellow traders are unanimously hoarding and unwilling to sell. Factories have some demand, but due to Saturday, everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a sudden disappearance of transactions.

The New York cotton market fell first due to short-selling by traders from the South and the weakness of Wall Street stocks, and then continued to decline due to the lack of buying interest from professionals. Yesterday's closing price was down 18-19 points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market plunged due to the liquidation of a large number of long positions and weak spot trading. Yesterday's closing prices were down about ten rupees each. It is also predicted that the opening market today will continue to be bearish by two and a half rupees.

### Rice Prices Vary; Speculation Appears to Be Strong

Recently, foreign rice seems to have entered a period of consolidation, rising and falling, changing daily. Yesterday, the trend turned back up again. At the start of the morning market, new hoarding by large players inside and outside the industry took advantage of the low prices to absorb quickly, and speculative trading by floating holders also became extremely active, throwing against each other, raising prices steadily. At the same time, local shops, seeing the market tightening again, followed suit by adding inventory, and the base appeared to be turning firm. High-grade goods, such as No. 1 Saigon, were scarce on the market, and were exceptionally firm, rising suddenly by about three yuan, opening at 127-8 yuan, and even bulk goods required 125-6 yuan. Medium-grade goods were slightly inferior, increasing by only a little over one yuan, opening at 124 yuan, 123.5 yuan. As for the scarcity and firmness of general mid-range goods, such as No. 2 Siam and Mindon, it was no less than high-grade Saigon. No. 2 Siam opened at 113 yuan, while Mindon was particularly outstanding, with bonded goods opening as high as 122 yuan to 118 yuan. As for the sales of other goods, they were not as smooth as the goods above, nor as welcomed by speculators, and did not receive the same attention for actual sales as did small sacks that are used only for speculative trading. As a result, these goods were grouped together, rising by one or two yuan. Closing prices for the day were 114 yuan and 113.5 yuan for bank and small sacks, 113.8 yuan and 113 yuan for foreign sacks, 115.5 yuan and 115 yuan for No. 2 Saigon, 116.5 yuan for high grade, 122 yuan to 120 yuan for Keo Fot Tip, 124 yuan for Yangon Tip, 87-8 yuan for broken tip high grade, 86 yuan for ordinary grade, and 84 yuan for Jue Zhi. Overall, although all goods rose in unison, the price increases varied greatly, from one or two yuan to three or four yuan, not as uniform as in previous days, indicating that it is difficult to generalize the situation of each good. A total of 50,850 bags of rice entered the warehouse in the past two weeks, with 1,128,235 bags currently in the warehouse, a decrease of 11,321 bags from the previous week, which is not significant. And 50,000-60,000 bags of public warehouse small sacks have not yet arrived, and there is no reason for speculative big players to boost their momentum. However, this situation has occurred, precisely because hoarders have not given up on their intentions, leading to more speculative actions. Volume reached over 30,000 bags, and 500-600 tons from Yinghua Company. However, there was some profit-taking in the afternoon, and market sentiment was slightly suppressed.

Due to the general shift in the focus of buyers to foreign rice, sales of thick and thin japonica rice from state owned vendors were not particularly brisk. Supply and demand were still relatively similar, and the market showed no particular favor. Nanhang early rice still opened at 147 yuan, falling to 144 yuan. With Zhoupu and other east early rice already out of season, Kunshan and other west new rice continued to come to market, with Kunshan new japonica opening at 155 yuan and 154 yuan. Thick broken rice seemed to have fallen out of favor and remained stagnant.

Glutinous rice showed brilliance along with the rising trend of foreign rice. In an environment of scarce goods and noisy demand, Hong Kong special grade opened at 138 yuan, bulk grade at 135-6 yuan, bonded grade at 133 yuan, and glutinous green bean at 111 yuan and 120.5 yuan.

### Foreign Flour Profit-Taking and Resale; One Rise and Then a Return to Flat

Yesterday, foreign flour first rose and then fell, and the market showed signs of consolidation. The market opened in the morning carrying on the rising trend from the previous day, causing floating long holders and speculative traders inside and outside the industry to become unusually active. American Kemp and various flours continued to rise, with American flour fort reaching 34.7-8 yuan, and Dongzhan Jinlong reaching 33.3 yuan. Xizhan rose from 32.6 yuan to 32.9 yuan, also up three, five, or six cents from the previous evening, and the market seemed to be thriving. However, as soon as prices rose, profit-takers took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and foreign firms and transshipment traders had already stopped and were waiting to see what happens, so the rise flattened out immediately. In the afternoon, it continued to weaken. As a result, other than Dongzhan Jinlong closing slightly higher than the previous day at 33 yuan, Xizhan was 32.5 yuan and fort was 34.4 yuan, similar to the previous market. Volume was 20,000 bags. Bran hoarders were active, with small bags priced at 33.8 yuan. Wheat was also in short supply and prices were being shouted up.

### Oil Market

### Rice Weevil Oil Vendors Equal in Strength; One Side Pushing Up, One Side Selling; Trading Was Lively

Yesterday, trading in edible oil futures was unprecedentedly lively. Rice weevils and oil vendors were restless. The former, accustomed to raising prices, aggressively played the long side. The latter, having heard that the first batch of incoming bonded oil had been shipped, rushed to dump, resulting in an evenly matched situation. Prices rose and fell abruptly and were finally suppressed by about two yuan. Total trading volume of Qing oil from the major factories approached 20,000 loads. The opening price for September delivery was 164.75 yuan, with a high of 165 yuan and a closing of 164 yuan. The opening price for October delivery was 167.75 yuan, with a high of 168 yuan, a low of 164.25 yuan, and a closing of 165.25 yuan. The opening price for October delivery was 169 yuan, with a high of 169.5 yuan, a low of 165.5 yuan, and a closing of 166.5 yuan. There were also 4,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from various factories (prices detailed in the market price column). As for raw soybean oil, trading was sparse and prices were flat, with 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil traded at a price of 265 yuan, and 20 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil traded at a price of 187 yuan.

### Finance

### Cash Inflation Continues Unabated

Yesterday's Shanghai gold market was the third and final day for the settlement of October contracts. Only less than 500 taels remained. Both long and short parties were not in a hurry to square their positions. Therefore, other than Xiangxingyong transferring 200 taels to Defu, Tianyuan transferred to Qingtaiyong, and Yuxingyong transferred to Xiangxingyong 10 taels each, so the price remained unchanged at 6,888 yuan from the morning opening to the afternoon closing, only squaring by a small one yuan. Cash, however, continued to rise unabated. Although vendors from Tianjin were selling, absorption by vendors from Hong Kong and jewelers made supplies tighter relative to demand. From the morning opening price of 9,250 yuan, counting up ten yuan, Tongkangyong first bought from Xianghe 30 taels, then He Shunyuan bought from Xiangxingyong 10 taels each, for 9,245 yuan, then Hesheng bought 20 taels, and Shunyuan bought from Xianghe 80 taels, Zhongxing 50 taels, Chengji 30 taels, and Hesheng 20 taels, for 9,285 yuan. Later, although Ho Fook tried to sell aggressively, the price still rose. It sold to Mingfeng 10 taels for 9,260 yuan and then sold to Shunyuan 30 taels and Zhongxing 20 taels for 9,270 yuan, then sold to Shunyuan and Mingfeng 50 taels each for 9,275 yuan, then sold to Mingfeng 10 taels for 9,280 yuan. Then Hesheng saw Shunyuan selling 50 taels to Hesheng for 9,275 yuan, Shunyuan bought from Tianyuan 10 taels for 9,280 yuan, and Xiangxingyong also started to buy from Defu 40 taels, rising to 9,290 yuan. Xianghe sold to Shihuo 20 taels and Shunyuan 10 taels, falling to 9,260 yuan, Xianxingyong bought 10 taels from Tianyuan for 9,270 yuan, Mingfeng bought 10 taels from Yongcheng for 9,280 yuan, then bought again from Hesheng 10 taels, rising twice to 9,290 yuan. At noon, it retreated slightly to 9,280 yuan, finally seeing Xiangxingyong buy 10 taels from Defu, closing the midday session at 9,285 yuan, squaring up 55 yuan, with a difference of 50 yuan on the day. Midday trading totaled 700 taels. In the afternoon, the market was closed. The selling price of standard gold from gold shops was 9,350 yuan, with the buying price 200 yuan lower than the selling price.

Ornamental Gold Up Another Ten Yuan

The selling price of jewelers' ornamental gold rose by ten yuan at 9:30 am, to 950 yuan (buying price reduced by 50 yuan), it is said.

### Foreign Exchange Black Market Again Active

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both the Central Bank and HSBC postings remain flat. Small counters such as HSBC also saw the British and American exchange rates remain flat. Because the September allotment of foreign exchange by the Exchange Equalization Fund for legitimate commercial settlement had been exhausted, Huahang and the fourteen British and American banks started processing October applications. Demand from non-essential import trading houses in the black market strengthened again, making it difficult to settle at 4.75 yuan per US dollar, so by noon it had softened to 4.71875 yuan, tightening by 0.031225, with the British gold price still at 2 shillings 8.125 pence. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon, it is said.

### Hong Kong Dollar Demand Also Strong

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw no changes in British and American gold pounds and British gold notes. Market prices were stable. US dollar notes continued to rise, reaching as high as 22.55 yuan in the evening session. Hong Kong dollar demand suddenly became strong, and market prices rose by one cent. Japanese yen notes also tended to rise, rising to 2.38 yuan in the evening session. Korean notes, however, tended to fall, retreating to 2.06 yuan in the evening session.

### Bank Reserve Committee Levies Handling Fees for Payment Orders

Effective October 1st

Due to rising prices and increased expenses, the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee has decided to levy handling fees for payment orders paid on behalf of ordinary correspondent banks (banks other than designated correspondent banks) starting October 1st. The method is based on the total amount of payments made by the committee on behalf of various banks (i.e., the total amount of checks drawn by various banks on the committee), with a handling fee of 50 cents per 10,000 yuan, settled every Saturday. The committee will directly pay the accounts of the correspondent banks' customers.

### Securities: Selling Pressure on Domestic Bonds Relatively Reduced

The over-the-counter market for public bonds saw selling stop yesterday, with the pressure on the market relatively reduced. However, sales from the "Tong Kang" account were still heavy, creating a relatively weak market. Therefore, the market initially tended to weaken, but later, due to stronger buying interest, it rebounded. As the war in Hunan Province gradually stabilized and people's confidence increased, the bond market may slowly rise. Yesterday was Saturday, with only one session in the morning. "Tong Shun," "Xin Fu," "Run De," "Yi Tai," and "Jiu Cheng" all made purchases, either shorting or going long, making the market quite lively. "Tong Kang," however, continued to sell as always, so Class C bonds once saw a low price of 0.04 yuan. Later, although "Lian He" and "Da Hua" also sold, the market sentiment had strengthened and gradually rebounded. For a time, there were signs of a recovery in market sentiment. The market price ultimately rebounded by 0.025 to 0.06 yuan. The trading volume was around 1.6 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Bank of China stock were traded at a price of 15 yuan per share.

### Textiles: "Dragon Head" Fine Cloth Breaks 60 Yuan Barrier

Mill Cloth: The market continued to be strong yesterday, due to good actual sales in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. Holders took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a state of demand exceeding supply. Sales of coarse cloth were flat, with some continuing to rise by 0.025 yuan. Fine cloth twills rose by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth quotations also rose by around 0.05 yuan. Wholesale houses in the street were less interested in buying due to Saturday and high prices. Speculators and dyers continued to take in over 300 pieces. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian buyers were rushing to assemble orders, continuing to process over 400 pieces of various cloths.

Eastern Cloth: Actual sales demand was strong, and market prices rose steadily. Futures prices for various months continued to rise on the exchange, by 0.039 to 0.045 yuan per piece. The spot market for fine cloth and fine twill was even tighter, with machine prices rising by 0.05 to 0.075 yuan per piece. New orders for 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth set a new high, closing at 60.035 yuan at noon. "Four Gentlemen" serge also rose, with new orders at 2.265 yuan per yard and old orders at 2.20 yuan.

### Flower Flannel Severely Scarce

Rare Arrivals of Western Goods and Reduced Production of Domestic Goods

Flower flannel is a necessary item for making suit linings. The woolen industry initially had fixed sales, but recently, seeing the strong production and sales of domestic goods, the factories expanded direct wholesale transactions. There are specialized dealers in lining materials such as Yuan Chang Xing, Hua Yang, Zhang Xiang Tai, Xin Da Chang, Da Chang De Chang, etc. As a result, other dealers continue to be short of goods. Recently, this type of flower flannel has been severely scarce in the market, with a particularly brisk trend. Spot wholesale prices have continued to rise, because there are only sales of imported goods with no replenishment. Due to rising costs, domestic goods are produced in smaller quantities. Considering the demand from various tailors, the price of Donghuo imported flower flannel is generally 1.5 yuan per yard. Hong Sheng brand is 4 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 3.78 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Price Rises Continue Strongly

Yesterday's sugar market continued to rise due to strong buying interest. Spot coarse white sugar rose by 2 yuan. Hong Kong sugar rose by 3.7 yuan. Futures were more bullish. "Car White" rose by 2 to 1.5 yuan. The guild's clearing prices for spot 24 coarse white sugar were 140.07 yuan and 142 yuan for September imports, and 140 yuan and 141.5 yuan for August, both up 2 yuan. July was 139.2 yuan and 140 yuan, up 1 yuan. June was 138.8 yuan, later rising to 140 yuan, up 2.4 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 126 yuan, 127 yuan, and 127.5 yuan, up 2 yuan. Tai Koo "Car White" B mark was 160 yuan, up 2 yuan. HX mark was 140 yuan and 141.5 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. H mark "Car Red" was 118 yuan to 118.5 yuan, up 5 yuan compared to the 23rd. Hong Kong coarse white was 132 yuan, 135 yuan, up 3.7 yuan, with a larger increase. Futures for 24 coarse white sugar expiring on September 30th were 137.7 yuan, 138.75 yuan, and 139 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. National Day expiry was 139.7 yuan, 140.04 yuan, and 140.35 yuan, up 1 yuan. A total of over 69,000 bags of futures were traded, and over 13,000 bags of spot goods were traded.

### Coal: Indian Coal Prices Rebound

Indian bituminous coal: In the previous week, speculators took advantage of high prices to sell, causing prices to fall back into the 600-yuan range. Recently, in view of the scarce arrivals, sales stopped and buying increased, causing prices to rise by over 10 yuan. Yesterday, Pu Dong wharf receipts were traded at 607-608 yuan, with lighterage extra. Retailers in the street were selling screened lump coal at 660 yuan and run-of-mine lump coal at 648 yuan, including cartage.

### Hardware: Autumn Rain All Day, Actual Sales Affected

Yesterday's incessant autumn rain affected hardware transactions. For example, tinned iron ordered by Tianjin dealers was sold due to the rain. Other manufacturers in the street also had slow transactions, such as Yuan Ding's new lead wire, Hui Si iron, plain white iron, tinned iron, white lead sheet, etc., all of which are hardware items that cannot get wet. Therefore, although some deals were made, it was difficult to deliver the goods. The standards of various goods were not much different from the previous day, such as 200-pound first-grade tinned iron selling for 850 yuan per box, 24-gauge large tinned iron opening at 1,500 yuan per box, 200-pound old steel factory Hui Si iron fetching 740 yuan, and new steel factory goods also needing around 730 yuan.

### Cork Oak (3)

— Gao Jianong

Speaking of the wood of the cork oak tree, besides the fact that the bark contains "tannins" that can be used for tanning leather or as dyes, it is only good for burning and has no other use because its wood is very heavy, easily cracks, and rots easily. This inevitably reminds me of a passage from Zhuangzi's "Human World": "The craftsman Shi of Qi went to Quyuan and saw a 'Li She' tree: it was large enough to shelter an ox, measured a hundred spans around... Spectators thronged like a market! The craftsman Shi did not look back and continued on his way. A disciple watched it and ran to the craftsman Shi, saying, 'Since I have followed you with axe and adze, I have never seen such beautiful timber! Why do you not look at it, master, but continue on your way?' He said, 'Enough! Say no more! It is useless timber: if it were used for a boat, it would sink; if it were used for a coffin, it would quickly rot; if it were used for a vessel, it would quickly break; if it were used for a door, it would ooze; if it were used for a pillar, it would be infested with insects. It is timber that is of no use...'" I believe that the "Li" mentioned here is just the "cork oak" because only its wood has these characteristics. The wood of other oaks is all very firm and strong, which is precisely excellent building material. In any case, although the wood of the cork oak is not worth mentioning, its special feature of producing cork is something that no other tree dares to hope for! So, in Zhuangzi's time, it was regarded as "useless timber," but now it has become "good timber," "unique timber," which no other tree can replace! It can also be seen that in this world, there are men of exceptional talent who, although not known or appreciated, will eventually emerge and shine! (The End)

### It Is Reported That British Special Envoy to the Far East, Duff Cooper, Will Visit Shanghai to Discuss Far East Affairs with U.S. Officials. He Has Already Met with Cole to Hear a Report. General Park Aufong Will Visit Chongqing.

Former British Minister of Information, Duff Cooper, has been ordered to come to the Far East, Singapore, to preside over the war apparatus, in order to strengthen British strength in the Far East. After Cooper arrived in Singapore, he has already met with British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, to gain a clearer understanding of the current situation in China based on Ambassador Kerr's report.

Military Personnel Accompanying the Envoy

The Times reported that according to Japanese sources, Duff Cooper, the former British Minister of Information and current Special Envoy to the Far East, will come to Shanghai with Major General Pigott, the former British Military Attaché in Tokyo, and other military personnel to meet with U.S. officials. It is also reported that Air Marshal Park Aufong, who is currently inspecting airfields in Burma, will soon visit Chongqing.

British Community in Shanghai Eagerly Awaits the Envoy

The English-language "China Press" also reported that regarding Duff Cooper's upcoming visit to Shanghai, it had not been officially confirmed as of this morning (the 25th). Alexander, the British Information Counsellor in Shanghai, replied to reporters that he had not yet received official news of this matter. However, it is heard that the British community in Shanghai is eager for Cooper to visit Shanghai because the city also occupies an important position in Far East affairs. It is reported that Kesserow, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is currently Cooper's advisor. If Cooper comes to Shanghai, Kesserow will come along with him.

### Rice Has Arrived: A Total of 58,000 Bags

Speculation in the rice market cannot raise prices because foreign rice is constantly arriving in Shanghai. 58,000 bags of public warehouse rice, shipped directly from Yangon by the Wah Loon Foreign Firm's "Teh Dah" vessel, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Long Mao warehouse in Pu Dong for unloading. Jardine Matheson's "Fu Sheng" vessel departed for Tianjin yesterday morning. In addition to loading 3,583 bags of foreign rice and 17,051 bags of flour from Hong Kong to Tianjin, it also loaded 1,590 bags of foreign rice in Shanghai.

### Classification of Cigarette License Tax Undecided

Regarding the issue of levying cigarette license tax, the Municipal Council originally planned to convene a Finance Committee meeting at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday to make a decision. According to a report by a "Da Zhong She" reporter, cigarette merchants in the International Settlement recently jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Council, requesting that the proposed classification into Class A for those with larger business scope and capital, and Class B for other stores, with annual payments of 30 yuan and 18 yuan respectively, be deemed unfair and in need of improvement. Therefore, after discussion on the 26th, it was decided to re-investigate the business conditions of various cigarette and paper stores before considering the classification method, and to hold another meeting soon to make a final decision.

### Foreign Firms Will Have Definite Recommendations on Foreign Exchange Difficulties. There Are Still Some Flaws in the Control Regulations. The Granting of Foreign Exchange Should Be Speedy and Convenient. It Is Proposed That a Stabilisation Fund Committee Member Be Permanently Stationed in Shanghai.

After the Stabilisation Fund Management Committee supplies foreign exchange for necessary imports at preferential prices in the Shanghai foreign exchange market, legitimate trade has theoretically obtained legal protection. However, since the implementation measures are not yet fully mature, ordinary merchants can still skillfully obtain foreign exchange from the fourteen friendly nation banks, while legitimate merchants may end up with nothing, making legitimate trade inevitably subject to various obstacles and restrictions.

British and American Merchants Unwavering in Their Support

According to a Continental Press report, major foreign merchants and bankers in Shanghai are currently studying constructive measures to help resolve many of the difficulties caused by the recent foreign exchange control regulations. It is reported that they have held several exploratory meetings over the past week, hoping to adopt some practical plans to solve the difficult foreign exchange problems. As a result of the meetings, no definite news was available yesterday (the 26th). However, it is rumored that at least one country's import and export merchants in Shanghai will take concrete action. According to inquiries made by reporters to various parties yesterday, major British and American merchants with a long-term vision have gradually agreed with the motives and purposes of the foreign exchange control regulations, and feel that it is necessary to take strict control measures in order to achieve the political, diplomatic, and financial goals of the Chinese, American, and British governments.

Practical Application Still Needs to be Improved

On the other hand, most major British and American merchants here are quite concerned about the practical application of the foreign exchange control regulations, believing that there is a chaotic state of foreign exchange in Shanghai. Unless immediate and active steps are taken to remedy this situation, the situation will worsen and become more chaotic. They told reporters that various legitimate import and export businesses in Shanghai have now virtually come to a standstill due to the difficulty in obtaining foreign exchange. Furthermore, the amount of foreign exchange available on the market is very small, causing some important imports to be hoarded, and their prices to soar unreasonably. There are also merchants operating in secret who are making huge profits by taking advantage of the convenience of obtaining foreign exchange at the official exchange rate. If this unhealthy trading situation continues, it will promote speculation, hoarding, and price manipulation even more rampant, and ultimately defeat the purpose of the foreign exchange control regulations.

Control Regulations Still Have Shortcomings

The purpose of the foreign exchange control regulations is to prevent foreign exchange from flowing into the hands of people in countries unfriendly to China, the United States, and Britain, allowing it to be controlled by the Japanese. This kind of control procedure does not necessarily have to kill other countries' foreign trade, as it kills Japan's foreign trade. However, the control regulations currently in place will cause the Sino-British and American trade in Shanghai and the Japanese financial activities to come to a standstill. This situation should be corrected immediately. The shortcomings of the control regulations are as follows: (1) Obtaining foreign exchange from the Stabilisation Fund is always unnecessarily delayed; (2) No distinction is made between the applications of legitimate merchants and hoarders/manipulators; (3) Shanghai merchants and bankers do not know how much foreign exchange the Stabilisation Fund will approve; (4) Merchants operating in secret can apply for foreign exchange simultaneously and separately from the fourteen banks, giving speculators and manipulators opportunities. British and American merchants here, in seeking constructive measures to remedy this situation, feel that at least one foreign member of the Stabilisation Fund Committee should be permanently stationed in Shanghai, so as to maintain close contact with the situation in Shanghai, and merchants in this city can also state their situation to the committee member. British and American merchants also suggested that a central organization should be established in Shanghai to study foreign exchange applications locally. After the initial research is completed, the application, with the written opinion attached, will be submitted to the Hong Kong Stabilisation Fund for final approval and allocation of foreign exchange. This method can eliminate the existing unnecessary delays.

Outstanding Foreign Exchange Should Be Taken Into Account

The business and banking communities also stated that a way should be found to take care of the outstanding foreign exchange owed by merchants in this city. The current control regulations do not have provisions for dealing with this kind of outstanding foreign exchange. According to inquiries made by reporters yesterday, the efforts of British and American merchants in Shanghai to find solutions have now gradually taken concrete form. It is heard that a representative will go to Hong Kong to state the views of merchants in this city to the Stabilisation Fund. At the same time, it is also reported that definite recommendations for resolving the foreign exchange difficulties in this city are currently being drafted and will be submitted to the Hong Kong Stabilisation Fund for reference. After Shanghai trade encountered layer upon layer of restrictions, the first to be hit were British and American merchants, especially American merchants. According to customs reports, the United States accounted for the largest share of Shanghai's import and export trade last month. Therefore, it is only right that American merchants request improvements to the foreign exchange management situation in Shanghai, which can be discussed at length.

Japanese Side Intensifies Control of Materials

The Japanese side stated that it will implement the "Prohibition and Restriction of the Movement of Materials" from the 1st of next month, and the Japanese military announced this morning the "Temporary Rules for the Crackdown on the Movement of Materials in Japanese-Occupied Areas in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River." This measure is clearly intended to intensify control, and absolutely prohibits the movement of various materials related to military supplies, that is, absolutely prohibits them from entering the concession or circulating within the occupied areas. Daily necessities needed by other civilians, such as rice, wheat, and other grains, cotton yarn, cloth, and other clothing items, are also included in the restricted transportation list and must be approved by the Japanese military. The Japanese side also wants to manage silk, tea, and tung oil exports, and will establish new institutions to control them.

### "President Pierce" to Arrive in Shanghai Tonight

Sailing to Hong Kong Tomorrow Night Before Returning to the United States

It is scheduled to arrive in port at around 8 PM tonight, mooring at buoys 12 and 22. Passengers will transfer to a small boat prepared by the company to disembark at the Customs House Wharf at 9 PM tonight. The mail steamer will stay in Shanghai for one night and depart from Shanghai tomorrow night (29th), still sailing to Hong Kong before returning to Honolulu. It will not call at Japanese ports. The last passenger boat will leave the Customs House Wharf at 9 PM tomorrow night.

### Living Expenses of Clerical Workers Should Be Recorded from October

In order to compile a cost-of-living index for the Chinese clerical worker class, the Bureau of Social Affairs of the Shanghai Municipal Council is requesting families to record their income and expenditure accounts in detail for three months. It is heard that the number of applicants has exceeded the planned number by more than double, and the deadline was as early as September 5. The income and expenditure account books for October, as well as the accounting instructions, have already been sent to each household by address. Table 1 (population), Table 2 (housing), and Table 3 (unused consumer goods) (referring to essential daily necessities prepared but unused before the start of accounting) in the account book should be filled in detail by each household in the prescribed format on September 30. As for the various income and expenditures during the month of October, they should be recorded in the account book from October 1st. It is best for each person in each household to prepare a small notepad to carry with them to record each item of income and expenditure one by one, and hand it over to the housewife every night to record it in the account book so as not to miss anything.

### British Businesses Operate as Usual, With No Feeling of Unease. Rumors of Imminent Withdrawal Are Pure Fantasy. Investment in Real Estate Is Also Very Active.

The North-China Daily News reported that the rumors spread by the Japanese side that some British merchants are about to withdraw from Shanghai were described by responsible parties yesterday (the 26th) as pure fantasy. Regarding Sassoon & Co., which was mentioned in Japanese news, an employee of the firm stated that the claim that Sassoon & Co. intends to move elsewhere is completely untrue.

Without Any Basis

It is said that Sir Victor Sassoon, a Shanghai financier, told reporters in Bombay on August 30 that British businesses have no reason to feel uneasy about the situation here. The Japanese authorities in Shanghai have assured him that Shanghai will not change even if war breaks out, but will continue to be regarded as an international metropolis. When reporters asked an employee of the Shanghai Dockyards Co. about the Japanese side's claim that the company had begun to withdraw, the reply was that this claim was

Extremely Ridiculous

and not worth a response. Reporters recently learned from well-informed sources in the real estate industry here that the widespread rumors that British merchants are eager to sell their properties are also untrue. Responsible parties stated that British merchants have recently purchased a lot of real estate, which the public is not aware of, indicating that from the perspective of British real estate investors, the future is by no means pessimistic.

### The Land Road Bridge Was Closed Again Yesterday

At around 10:45 yesterday, the Japanese side imposed martial law in the Land Road area of Yangshupu in eastern Shanghai, and closed the Land Road Bridge, cutting off all traffic for pedestrians and vehicles. A search was conducted in the vicinity until around 12 noon before it was reopened.

### French Vessel Changes Route to Korea

The French merchant vessel "Arlbert," which originally sailed on the Shanghai-Vietnam route, has now changed its route to between Shanghai and Korea. It departed from buoys 20 and 21 in the Whangpoo River yesterday afternoon.

### Gasoline Prices Unchanged After Supply Restrictions

The three major gasoline companies in Shanghai, Standard Oil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco, have repeatedly planned to restrict gasoline use due to transportation difficulties. Standard Oil has now decided to implement the restrictions tomorrow and announced yesterday: "To Whom It May Concern, starting September 29, our service stations will sell 'Mobilgas' only upon presentation of a 'Gasoline Ration Card.' These ration cards have now been mailed to our valued regular customers. On Saturday (i.e., yesterday), any customer on our registered list who wishes to purchase gasoline from our service stations will be limited to three gallons. On Sunday (i.e., today), all of our service stations will be closed (except for Mobil Oil lubrication services). Starting Monday morning, gasoline will only be sold upon presentation of a ration card. Please take note." Therefore, customers flocked to the company's gas stations yesterday. Oil company personnel stated that since the Hong Kong Equalization Fund provides foreign exchange for gasoline imports, gasoline prices will not change. Considering that the number of oil tankers arriving in Shanghai is gradually decreasing, it is necessary to restrict gasoline rationing.

### Gong Guoliang Arrested in Suzhou

Over Three Thousand Men Disarmed; Rumored to Be Related to Car Bombing Case

It is said that a major incident occurred in Suzhou on the 24th, and the situation was extremely tense at the time. Consequently, Gong Guoliang and his younger brother Gong Guot were arrested by the Japanese. According to reliable sources yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing railways have recently been repeatedly sabotaged, causing severe damage. The Japanese side secretly dispatched investigators to conduct a covert investigation. Subsequently, multiple individuals were apprehended in Jiaxing city. In addition to the ongoing interrogation, it was also discovered that the incidents of sabotaging the railways on the Beijing-Shanghai line were related to Gong's unit. Therefore, on the 24th, Gong, his brother Guozhen, and over a hundred men from his unit were detained and held at the Japanese Military Police in Suzhou for interrogation. Furthermore, Gong's unit of over three thousand men was entirely disarmed. As a result, the situation that day was severe. The emergency alert in Suzhou was subsequently lifted.

### British Ship Mishap

The British-owned Swire Shipping Company's North China line vessel, Yuezhou (this ship was reassigned to the North China route after the Shuntian was requisitioned last month), returned to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday morning. It docked at Pier 3 of the company's Bund location in the French Concession to unload cargo. Around 4 p.m., while unloading, a mishap occurred in the forward hold. Thick smoke billowed out, and the fire raged fiercely. Upon being notified, the ship's owner immediately hoisted distress flags. The Pudong Lujiazui Customs fireboat spotted the signal and dispatched the Pujie fireboat to extinguish the fire. It was extinguished at 5:15 p.m. The chestnuts, vermicelli, carpets, fruits, and other items stored in the forward hold were either destroyed or damaged by water. The losses were significant. It is said that there were several hundred carpets, which were to be transshipped to England. These items were the most valuable and were insured beforehand.

### Fei Ziyi Abducted This Morning

Fei Ziyi, a native of Changzhou, is 65 years old and resides at No. 44 Lianzhu Lane, Avenue Edward VII. Before the war, he was a partner in a pawnshop in his hometown. He is now living in Shanghai as a retiree. At approximately 0:15 a.m. this morning, he was returning home in a hired car. As the car approached the lane entrance, four bandits lying in ambush emerged with handguns. They forced him into a car and drove off westward.

### Puyi Handicraft Society Trains Refugees in Production; Develops Specialized Skills for Self-Reliance; Seeks Discarded Clothing and Old Items as Raw Materials

After the refugee camps closed, groups of refugees returned to the Nanshi, Zhabei, and other areas, overwhelmed by the changes. They hoped to rebuild their families amidst the rubble. The middle-aged and able-bodied refugees could find some work to maintain a basic standard of living, but the elderly, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows had no means to support themselves and were mostly still displaced and struggling to survive. The Christian Puyi Handicraft Society was established to address this urgent need, with the primary goal of training refugees in production skills. This new, proactive relief effort deserves social reporting.

Puyi Handicraft - Significant Meaning

Recognizing that refugees with no food, lodging, or work were prone to developing laziness, the Society organized "Puyi Refugee Handicraft" with the aim of enhancing the refugees' spirit of self-sufficiency and eliminating the bad habit of permanently relying on relief. Therefore, special emphasis is placed on training in various life skills, providing reasonable wages, clothing, and food to sustain their current lives, and striving to enable them to become independent and self-sufficient, achieve food security, and rebuild perfect families. This type of relief work is known in Europe and America as Goodwill Industries, charitable crafts founded by enthusiastic philanthropists and religious figures specifically to help the elderly, weak, sick, and poor civilians. Mr. Boone adopted this method three years ago and started in Nanshi, working diligently to this day.

Refugee Workshops - Engaging in Production

The Christian Puyi Church at Dadongmen, slightly damaged by artillery fire before the war, is now used as a refugee workshop, housing hundreds of destitute and helpless refugees as workers. They are first given appropriate training. Young girls learn weaving and knitting socks, adult women learn sewing and embroidery, old women learn washing and ironing, and men learn carpentry, painting, and machine work. Even the disabled are required to learn the work they can do. The reporter personally saw several frail old women over seventy years old cutting up rags and sewing them into long strips to be used as mops. Their working hours are five hours, allowing them to return home to take care of necessary personal matters. The food and clothing provided, and the average wage is about 50 or 60 cents per person. Although the amount is small, the Society's goal is not to make them fully fed, so as not to develop a habit of relying on relief. This also allows them to find work outside after learning the skills, and to allow other refugees to enter the Society for training.

Broadly Seeking Waste Materials - Repairing and Remanufacturing

The Society has prepared a "Puyi Bag" and distributes it to donors, soliciting clothing, footwear, furniture, and all kinds of supplies from all sectors of society. Families, businesses, and schools that sympathize and are willing to set up Puyi Bags for regular donations are requested to call "16082" or write to the Society's office at Room 308, No. 115 Hankou Road, and the Society will come to collect the donations at the specified time. These donations are washed, sorted, and distributed to various departments of the refugee workshop for work. By utilizing waste materials, everything can be restored to like-new condition, or made into useful items. Even scraps of silk and broken cloth, the reporter has witnessed several women weaving them into extremely beautiful small carpets.

Refugee Products - Not for Profit

The products of the refugee workshop include newly woven cloth and socks, machine-made noodles, modified clothing and footwear, repaired daily necessities, painted furniture and toys, and carpets and slippers made from waste materials. Every product that is not completely usable will not be sold. The target customers are the refugees themselves. All daily necessities for ordinary people are sold at prices several times lower than the market price. The goods that some refugees do not need are also sold to the outside world at half the market price. The proceeds from the sale of the products are used entirely for the wages of the refugee workers and other relief expenses. The aim is not to make a profit, so the sale of goods is not handled by shops in the market.

Refugee Welfare - Comprehensive Facilities

In addition to handicraft relief, the Society also has various refugee welfare facilities, such as a free clinic for medical care, treating refugees' diseases, providing vaccinations, conducting physical examinations for children, distributing cod liver oil, soy milk, and providing bathing facilities for refugee children. In terms of education, there is a nursery, kindergarten, and a complete primary school. Most of the students are children of refugee workers and poor, homeless children. They are exempted from tuition and miscellaneous fees, and lunch is provided. There are also adult literacy classes, where chicken farmers and the poor can enroll for free to study in the morning and evening when they have free time. The Society distributes rice and wheat donated by the American Red Cross to elderly and weak refugees. If there are elderly patients and destitute women in childbirth, they are given cash. This direct relief is strictly limited and is entirely for the sake of the refugees, as the Society aims to train refugees to help themselves and become self-reliant, and does not want them to obtain food and clothing without effort, as this would lead to laziness.

### Welcoming October

— Long Jusheng

May, July, August, September—several months of humiliation—have passed quietly one after another! What is slowly descending is a glorious and bright “Flying October”!

"October," in the history of the New China, is a condensation of the blood of martyrs and is full of vigorous and prosperous vitality.

The thirtieth birthday of the Republic of China—National Day—will come from hardship and arduousness, "October 10th" is such a great festival! I think the children must remember it very clearly.

Jesus, in order to save the world, was nailed to the "cross" by ruthless demons using cruel means. However, although Jesus's body died, Jesus's spirit of universal love and saving the world shines like the sun and moon and is passed down through the ages without extinction. Because there are countless Jesuses who follow the path of the blood-stained cross and move forward to fight for the freedom and love of mankind. Therefore, the song "Jesus is my savior" echoes through , and permeates the universe. Here, the author wants to ask the children, everyone is facing the coming "October", who is the savior of our Chinese nation? Who is our Jesus who saves us from suffering? Please find the answer for yourselves. What must be remembered most is that children must have the "cross" spirit of saving the world and saving people!

### The Story of the Eclipse

— Yang Chunlv

The solar eclipse, which is rare in a century, was presented before our eyes last Sunday; although the sky was cloudy and it was impossible to observe clearly, it was still fortunate to see the spectacle of the moon's shadow covering the sun in a moment when the floating clouds dispersed. At that time, did you hear people beating gongs and setting off firecrackers? Did they ever tell you about superstitions such as "wild sun eats domestic sun" or "heavenly dog eats the sun"? But after you have read the "Observation and Experiment of Solar Eclipses" and "What is a Solar Eclipse?" in this journal, will you still believe in any "wild sun" or "heavenly dog"? I know that children who have carefully observed and done hands-on experiments will definitely find its truth.

Here are two more stories about eclipses for you:

Increase a day's wage: In the past, in the Natal region of South Africa, many miners were working in the mine when suddenly the sun hid, and it suddenly turned into a dark world. After a while, the sun came out of the darkness again and shone on the earth as before. In the eyes of ignorant workers, this was of course very strange. So when they received their wages, everyone surrounded the owner and asked for an extra day's wage. They said, "We have worked for two days, because there is a night in between."

Postpone for two weeks: In 654 AD, there was another solar eclipse. Many people in Paris flocked to the church to confess to the pastor to avoid disaster. The pastor sat in a small room and listened to their confessions one by one. Finally, he was sleepless, tired, and hungry to the point of being unbearable, so he came out and shouted to the congregation: "Brothers! Because there are so many people, the astronomers have decided to postpone the eclipse for two weeks."

Children! Did you find the above stories funny? But modern people, when they see a solar eclipse, beat gongs and drums, burn incense, and light candles, are even more stupid; and those words of "wild sun" and "heavenly dog" are not even more absurd?

### Children and Music

— Yingdai

In recent years, the interest of children in Shanghai in music has been growing day by day. We only need to see that most children are equipped with a harmonica, playing it at any time, and the older ones, if their families have musical instruments such as pianos or mandolins, will also be very happy to practice them. No matter whether it's popular songs from movies or radio, children can sing them in tune, all of which proves that Shanghai children's interest in music is growing!

We believe that at least some of these children have musical talent. However, if there is only musical talent and no one to give correct guidance, the result will be nothing more than burying their talent. Like the Soviet Union, they have always paid great attention to children's art, so children's plays, children's films, and children's music performances are often seen by people in major Soviet cities. As a result, the Soviet Union has cultivated many talented child musicians in the past ten years. In addition, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States are also making unremitting efforts to promote children's music; however, this is lacking in China. Even in this city of Shanghai, there is no platform to promote children's music, which cannot but make people feel regretful!

But good news has come. Recently, the Shanghai Children's Conservatory of Music has been officially established, located in Yuyuan New Village, Yuyuan Road. In Shanghai, and even in the whole of China, the emergence of a children's conservatory of music is indeed an initiative. It is said that the purpose of establishing this children's conservatory of music is to cultivate children with musical talent, so that their talent will not be buried due to lack of guidance. The first class will enroll 50 children, limited to children aged 5 to 15. Anyone who is considered to have special musical talent based on the test results can be admitted free of charge.

Since the Shanghai Children's Conservatory of Music began recruiting, it has held an entrance examination on the 21st. It is estimated that the 50 student places will be fully filled in the first recruitment. After the school starts, the subjects taught will include piano, violin, vocal music, and all basic musical knowledge. It can be seen that such a children's conservatory of music is quite complete. We believe that after an appropriate period of time, this children's conservatory of music will definitely cultivate a group of child musicians. This is indeed good news for children in Shanghai who love music.

### An Arithmetic Game

— Xinfang

Children, if you have free time, you may want to invite a few friends or classmates to play an arithmetic game. On the one hand, you can improve your calculation skills, and on the other hand, it is also an interesting pastime. Now I will list the methods of this game as follows:

As long as you know someone's age and the door number of their residence, you can use arithmetic methods to obtain an answer. The last two digits must be the person's age, and the other digits are the door number of the person's residence. First, double the door number of the person's residence, then add five, then multiply by ten, then add the person's age, then add three hundred and sixty-five, and then subtract six hundred and fifteen to get the desired answer.

Let me take myself as an example. The door number of my residence is eighty-nine. Doubling it is one hundred and seventy-eight, adding five is one hundred and eighty-three, multiplying by fifty is nine thousand one hundred and fifty. I am twenty years old this year, adding twenty is nine thousand one hundred and seventy, adding three hundred and sixty-five is nine thousand five hundred and thirty-five, subtracting six hundred and fifteen from this number gives eight thousand nine hundred and twenty. Twenty is my age, and eighty-nine is the door number of my residence.

Finally, I must add a few words. The number of digits in the door number can be ignored, but if the age of the person being guessed exceeds two digits, then this game is not applicable.

### About the Sun

— Jinzhen

Last Sunday's solar eclipse attracted the most attention. Indeed, a solar eclipse is a rare opportunity in several hundred years, and who would be willing to give up such an opportunity in vain? Unfortunately, the sky last Sunday was always covered with clouds, especially around noon, which was the beginning of the solar eclipse, but the clouds in the sky still did not dissipate, which was really disappointing. It wasn't until around one o'clock that there was some sunlight, and Ah Hui hurriedly walked to the balcony, stretched her neck, opened her eyes wide, and brought a pair of her father's sunglasses, wanting to see the spectacle of this solar eclipse. Around one-thirty, the clouds cleared and the sunlight shone directly down. At this time, she saw a black shadow printed on the sun, which was not good-looking at all. According to the newspaper, the sky was dim and almost like night during the solar eclipse, but the sky last Sunday was only a little darker. She went to the balcony with great interest, but came down disappointed.

"Brother, what exactly is the sun?" As soon as he stepped into the study, he saw Ah Ming sitting on the sofa and asked him this.

"The sun is a ball of fire that is so hot it's burning. It can emit light and heat. It has the closest relationship with us. If there is no sun, all the trees, flowers, and plants, and the rice and wheat we eat, will not grow, so we will have nothing to eat. And once there is no sun, there will be no light, no heat, no distinction between day and night, and the temperature of the air will not change, it will always be ice-cold. There will be no wind, and no rain will fall. The water in the oceans will dry up, and the entire Earth will freeze, and we will be frozen like a piece of machine ice. Do you think this situation is scary?"

"Then how does the sun emit heat and light? How far is it from us?"

"The sun is a ball of fire that is burning, so anything that enters the sun will burn. When something burns, it emits a very strong light, and heat is also produced. But the sun's light and heat are so strong that they are frightening. Look, the temperature inside the sun is really high, as high as about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Ordinary heat of about 100 degrees is already unbearably hot. The sun has a temperature of 10,000 degrees, which is really shocking. The sun is even bigger than the Earth. If you take a very fast train around the sun, it would take ten years. The distance between it and the Earth is also terrifying. If a train could travel in the air, it would take 350 years to travel directly from Earth to the sun day and night. Isn't that a fool's talk?" Indeed, Ah Ming was talking a bit foolishly. How could there be such a fact?

"Brother, since the sun is a ball of fire that is burning, then won't there be a day when it burns out?"

"That's right. The sun burns down day by day, and it may burn out one day, but the sun is really big, and there are really many things to burn. Moreover, the source of this burning will not be completely cut off immediately. If the sun's burning really has a time to burn out, I don't know how many thousands of years it will be. We don't need to worry about this, because we can live at most a hundred years. You think, where will we go after ten thousand years?" Ah Ming laughed as he spoke, and Ah Hui laughed along with him, because he already understood what Ah Ming was saying, which was really a bit funny.

The Problem Erupted: Suqiu Proposed a Divorce

Even though "Qiuer" had so many social engagements, she still occasionally perfunctorily entertained Wang Helin. Wang, considering his unlucky status, pretended to be deaf and dumb to Wu's actions. In theory, Wu and Wang could have lived in peace for a while. However, since Wu Suqiu intentionally stopped perfunctorily entertaining Wang, Wang Helin felt a change in the atmosphere, as if the autumn air was bleak with the change of seasons. Wang was a young man in his twenties and was not skilled enough at "endurance," so the problem erupted.

One afternoon (the 17th of this month), Wang went to Wu's house and happened to find Wu on the phone. Wang heard something strange in her tone outside the window and sneaked into another room to eavesdrop using the headphone jack. It turned out that Qiuer was talking sweet nothings and making secret appointments with Cha Yishao. Wang was furious and sternly questioned Qiuer. Qiuer said, "Are you worthy of interfering with me? I stopped loving you a long time ago. Let's break up as soon as possible. I can't wait to beg for food with a poor guy like you in the future." Wang Helin never expected her to be so bold and straightforward. However, although their marriage was not formally established, they had gone through the engagement ceremony and had engagement certificates, each holding one. Not only that, but as a result of their intimate relationship over the past few years, Qiuer gave birth to a chubby baby girl three years ago! Saying divorce means divorce, that's nothing, but what about this baby?

As a Result, the Engagement Certificate Was Burned, and the Baby Was Raised by Wu's Mother

Wu's mother was ultimately experienced and deep. Her view was: Socializing is socializing, and the friends you play with can never be taken seriously, because: You love his money, and he loves your face. What happens when his money runs out and your beauty fades? However, Qiuer could not listen to her mother's advice at this time. Finally, she and Wang Helin returned the engagement certificates to each other and burned them immediately. Wu's mother said: Qiuer's baby cannot be returned to the Wang family. I still want to keep her in front of me to relieve my boredom. So it was agreed that the baby would be raised by Wu's mother.

### Career Incompatibility: Movie Star Asks for Divorce

Hollywood movie star Marjorie Weaver and U.S. Navy officer Lieutenant Commander Xia Xi have been married for four years, but due to career incompatibility, one is in the film industry and the other is in the military and cannot leave, resulting in separation. Marjorie therefore asked for a divorce on the grounds of "intolerable abuse," which has been approved by the court. According to Marjorie, she told reporters: She has lived in Hollywood for the past four years, while Lieutenant Commander Xia Xi has served in the Asian Fleet, stationed in Manila and China. They have only met for sixteen days in the past four years. Lieutenant Commander Xia Xi is currently a U.S. Navy observer, drifting at sea on a British submarine, with an uncertain whereabouts, but enjoying it himself.

### The Story of the Movie "Family" (5)

— Zhou Yibai

Before long, these three different dramas were staged decisively within a year. On a starry night, Juehui had just returned from school, preparing to talk to Mingfeng. When he walked under the window, he happened to hear Mingfeng talking to another maid, Wan'er. Juehui waited for a while until Wan'er went to another place before asking about Mingfeng. He learned that his grandfather's friend, Feng Leshan, wanted to take a concubine and was preparing to choose one from Mingfeng and Wan'er. At first, Juehui didn't pay much attention. A few days later, Zhou Shi called Mingfeng to her room and told her that she had been selected by Feng Leshan and was preparing to send her over the next day. Although Mingfeng had realized that this matter might be unfavorable to her, she didn't expect it to happen so quickly. She begged Zhou Shi bitterly, but Zhou Shi was doing this according to the old master's wishes. Although she felt sorry for Shi Mingfeng, she could not help. Mingfeng had no choice but to go to Juehui for advice. It happened that Juehui was running a publication and was busy writing articles. Not only did he not know that Feng Leshan was going to take Mingfeng as a concubine, but he didn't even have time to talk to Mingfeng. So, Mingfeng, in disappointment, lamented her misfortune and had no choice but to run to the pond in the back garden and drown herself in martyrdom. It wasn't until the Feng family came to pick up the concubine the next day that everyone discovered this matter. However, the old master had already promised Feng Leshan and could not let the empty sedan return, so he had to replace her with another maid, Wan'er. At this time, Juehui returned from school and, after finding out everything, realized that Mingfeng had died. The mistake had already been made, and there was no way to undo it, even if he cried to the heavens.

(2) Xin Yanqiu

Xin Yanqiu, some people say that she was also a character from Tianqiao at first—like Xue Yanqin—and became famous around the same time as Xue Yanqin. Among the leading female roles (except for those who sing old male roles), she is the most senior. More than ten years ago, Chang Chunheng opened the first stage in Dan Gui, and she was hired as the leading actress. At the same time, Xue Yanqin was hired by the Tianchan Stage, but was ranked third. (The leading actor was Gao Qingkui, and the second actor was Qilin Tong.) Before she had been on stage for a month, Chang Chunheng was suddenly assassinated at the entrance of the theater. A few years ago, when she was performing in Beijing, there was an assassination case in the pool, and she was innocently suspected and suffered a lot of fright. This matter caused a sensation for a while. Later, she was invited by the Shanghai Gengxin Stage, and after only a few days of performing, Yu Yefeng was also assassinated in the box. Xin Yanqiu's appearance is elegant, clear, and beautiful, delicate and graceful. Her eyebrows naturally have a pitiful look, and the shocking and unusual things happened repeatedly when she was performing. Alas, how can a weak person bear this? In terms of her performance, she has an excellent stage presence and imitates Cheng Yanqiu's every frown and smile, fearing that she won't be like her, and she has reached the point of perfection. She is one of the so-called "Four Great Diamond Actresses."

Chapter 17: Angered for Beauty

Xu Jing smiled and said, "Does Brother have the art of judging people by their appearance? Although a person's appearance is somewhat related to their lifelong career, Fan Li in the past ridiculed the King of Yue for having a long neck and a crow's beak, saying that he could share adversity but not prosperity, and it was unfortunately said. Grand Master Wen was actually a successor of Zixu. However, Confucius said, 'Judging people by their appearance, I lost Ziyu.' Tan Jianming's appearance is not worthy of his virtue, and Zhang Liang's appearance is like that of a woman, and the Grand Historian believed that it was a small claim to his ambition. Zhang Liang was able to help Han Gao achieve imperial achievements. Ma Wu had an ugly appearance and was rejected by Wang Mang, but he became a famous general during the Guangwu Restoration. How can appearance really determine a person's life?" Zhang Cangqiu also said that Wu Sangui was brave and promising and was still a hero of the time. Liu Yinying smiled slightly and said, "This is just my rash statement and is of course not credible. Let's see the facts later. Of course, I also hope that General Wu can perform meritorious service for the country, eliminate bandits, and pacify the country and resist foreign enemies, then we can also attach ourselves to him and become more prominent." Chen Fei said, "I only hope that General Wu can transfer troops into the pass as soon as possible. When he meets the bandits, he can fight them heartily. If he can catch Li Chuang, then I will be very happy." Zhang Cangqiu also said, "Second brother is right, I also want to have a bloody battle with the bandits and relax my muscles and bones." After saying that, he drank a cup in one gulp. Everyone raised their glasses and drank heartily. Although Liu Yinying did not like to drink alcohol, he drank several cups tonight, and his cheeks were slightly flushed, as娇美as a woman. Not only did Xu Jing look at him frequently, but Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei also stared at Liu Yinying's drunken face in a daze. Everyone drank until the bottles of wine were empty and the dishes were finished before they dispersed and went to bed. (180)
