### During the Battle of Northern Hunan, Chinese Aircraft Fly Over Changsha, Japanese Troops Flee in Panic

Accurate Bombing Achieves Great Results, Foreigners in Changsha Talk to American Reporters

Changsha, Foreigners recently described to reporters the situation during the four days of Japanese occupation of Changsha, saying that when Chinese aircraft bombed the Japanese troops north of Changsha, the Japanese troops were greatly alarmed and fled in panic. The Japanese aircraft also did not engage in combat and turned tail and flew away. The foreigners who witnessed the situation at the time also said that the Japanese troops were very terrified when they saw Chinese aircraft and hid in shelters for a long time, not daring to stick their heads out. The Chinese aircraft bombed quite accurately, so their bombing of the Japanese troops was also very effective. One clergyman reported that when eight Chinese aircraft flew overhead and circled, and all the Japanese aircraft had flown away, he was talking to a Japanese officer. The Japanese officers asked him whether those aircraft were Chinese. He replied yes. He said that you can imagine how those people looked at that time. One of them said, "What are you talking about? Does China also have aircraft?" At that time, the Chinese aircraft did not circle for as long as the Japanese aircraft had done before, but formed a swarm and dropped bombs directly on the Japanese cavalry from a distance of one and a half miles from the city. All the foreigners in Changsha unanimously acknowledged that although the Japanese troops were able to act arbitrarily in the city during the day, they were unable to control anything at night. At that time, the Chinese guerrillas entered the city and repeatedly disrupted the Japanese troops and engaged in street fighting with them. It was also said that the Chinese artillery units on the west bank of the Xiang River often bombarded the Japanese troops' concentration points in the east of the city and in some parts of Changsha at night with concentrated artillery fire.

Editorial

### The Defense of Moscow

The vast military machines of both Germany and the Soviet Union are now racing against time. What Germany is striving to achieve is to occupy Moscow before winter arrives. This not only embodies the illusion of achieving a decisive victory in the entire war, but also, in order to shield its large army within Soviet territory from decisive Soviet attacks during the winter, it seems necessary for it to capture Moscow, thereby completely eliminating the possibility of the Soviet army organizing local counter-offensives during the winter. Otherwise, the Soviet army, using Leningrad, Moscow, and the southern Ukrainian region as triangular strongholds, will inevitably take advantage of the superior conditions of weather, terrain, and people throughout the long winter to cause great trouble and attacks to the German army, creating a favorable situation to await the arrival of the general counter-offensive next year. From the Soviet Union's perspective, its urgent task now is, of course, to quickly gather a strong reserve army to block the German army on the outskirts of Moscow, stabilize the war situation, and turn it into a seesaw battle. One aspect is to cover the evacuation of troops and industries from the vast industrial areas in the west and south, and to reorganize and rectify them in the rear. At the same time, it is also to support the war situations in the northern Leningrad military district and the southern Ukrainian region. Otherwise, if Moscow falls, the large armies on the northern and southern flanks of the Soviet army will inevitably be implicated and forced to retreat eastward on a large scale. Therefore, the biggest turning point in the entire war situation at present is: whether the German army can capture Moscow before winter, or whether the Soviet army can gather sufficient military strength before winter to keep the German army blocked on the outskirts of Moscow.

This German offensive began on October 1st. Its line of development, in the center, is divided into two routes. One route advances from Smolensk along the railway towards the west of Moscow, and the other route advances from Roslavl towards the area of Bryansk and Oryol to the south of Moscow. This is a pincer movement against Moscow. As for the progress of the war, according to various telegrams and observations in recent days, two points are particularly noteworthy on the German side: (1) The German army's current offensive route, due to the Soviet army's repeated emphasis on encirclement during their retreat, has forced it to repeatedly expand the two pincers on the north and south, gradually revealing a tendency to exceed the position of Moscow. If the Soviet army continues to hold Moscow firmly, then, unless a complete encirclement of the Moscow area is carried out, this large pincer movement will be difficult to close together. If the German army is indeed planning to completely encircle the Moscow area, then the current German military strength is probably insufficient. How will Germany add a large number of troops and equipment? This is worth noting. (2) Another ambition of the German army in this central offensive is to try to completely eliminate the large army under General Timoshenko, so in addition to launching a huge pincer movement against the ultimate target of Moscow, it also adopts many local pincer movements for each battle, attempting to individually eliminate the Soviet army piece by piece. As for the Soviet army, what deserves our attention is, first of all, that its retreat is a completely planned and orderly retreat, and not a rout after defeat. Secondly, its local emphasis on encirclement in each battle is especially commendable. Finally, assuming that the news that the Soviet army had already pre-built solid fortifications near Moscow is credible, then the Soviet army's command headquarters can be said to have made good use of the situation in this war.

Of course, in addition to the central Moscow, the southern war has not completely stopped, and is now advancing along the eastern bank of the Dnieper River towards the Mariupol area along the Sea of Azov.

Looking at the large number of troops used by Germany this time, as well as the great determination it has shown, anyone can see that its greatest effect is indeed a gamble, a risky all-out effort. The inner anxiety and distress shown by it to Hitler is very obvious. Facing the established situation of the great unity of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Germany must not allow the war to drag on for a long time and sit idly by while awaiting its own demise. But on the other hand, with the Soviet Union's great resistance, coupled with the abundant resources of Britain and the United States, the gain or loss of Moscow is certainly important, but to achieve a decisive victory in one fell swoop is really easier said than done! This is the biggest contradiction between ambition and reality, which Germany is currently unable to resolve. But when we look deeper, the great risks that Germany is taking this time cannot help but be shocking. If the Soviet Union gathers a large army and keeps the German army blocked on the outskirts of Moscow during the winter, then the greatest difficulties that the German army will encounter at the front will first be the severe cold, and secondly hunger. Without sufficient cold-proof equipment and without sufficient food supply, this will be a major blow to the morale and combat capabilities of the German army. In addition, the German army, in the form of a lone army penetrating deep, its rear is bound to be in a double threat at all times, one is the Soviet army's large-scale encirclement on the northern and southern flanks, launching a counter-encirclement, and the other is the British army's counter-offensive in the west, making the German army unable to respond from head to tail, falling into a dilemma of being unable to advance or retreat.

In short, the Soviet army's situation is not dangerous, as long as it can hold Moscow. In order to help the Soviet army achieve its goal, Britain immediately launching an experimental local offensive is indeed the most effective way.

### Eastern European War Tense; US Concerned About Far East Situation

Possibility of Japan Taking Advantage to Advance North Believed; Large Quantities of US Military Supplies Need to be Shipped to the Soviet Union Continuously

Washington, 14th (United Press) Congressional sources stated yesterday that President Roosevelt believes that even if Moscow falls, the Soviet army will still be able to continue its long-term resistance against Germany. These sources also stated that the President is extremely concerned about the situation in the Far East, especially the possibility of Japan attempting to seize Siberia in the event of any real signs of a Soviet collapse. It is also reported that he is concerned about Japan's possible "large-scale advance south," which could lead to "more serious changes" for the United States. Congressional sources stated that President Roosevelt believes that the Red Army will form a semi-circular defense line along the Volga River, sufficient to protect forty percent of the area where Soviet wartime industries are located. Congressional sources stated that this information was included in the report submitted to President Roosevelt by Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins. It is reported that President Roosevelt is currently waiting for a further report on this issue from Harriman, the head of the US delegation to Moscow, in order to determine whether the situation described by Hopkins is still adaptable.

Washington, 14th (Reuters) President Roosevelt stated yesterday that military aid to the Soviet Union is constantly being shipped from US ports. The United States is currently doing its utmost to ship military supplies to the Soviet Union within the scope of possibility in order to assist in the continuing and courageous resistance. A large number of supplies have been shipped out in the past few days. All the war equipment promised to be delivered in October during the Moscow conference, including tanks, airplanes, and trucks, will be delivered to the Soviet Union by the end of this month, it is said. This simple statement was issued by the White House without further explanation, but it is generally believed that the President's statement is intended to encourage current Soviet morale. The statement also indicates that US Army and Navy Department personnel were very busy at the end of last week, rushing to ship supplies to ports of departure.

Sydney, 14th (Reuters) The newspapers here, when commenting on the news that Japan is currently waiting for an opportunity to attack the Soviet Union from behind, are all calling on the democratic countries to give Japan a frank warning. The Sydney Daily Telegraph reported that if there is a strong alliance in the Pacific to deal with Japan, it can still make the attack on the Asian part of the Soviet Union too costly. If the ABCD line countries declare that an attack on the Soviet Union will be regarded as an attack on the Pacific countries, then Japan will not be so eager to move forward, it is said.

### Wakasugi Meets with Welles; Discusses US-Japan Relations

Ishii Says Willing to Endure to the Last Moment; Hopes for Peaceful Resolution of Pending Issues Between the Two Countries

Washington, 13th The Japanese Minister Without Portfolio Wakasugi, who returned here on the 8th of this month, visited US Undersecretary of State Welles this afternoon and discussed US-Japan relations for an hour. The content was not disclosed.

Tokyo, 14th (Reuters) The Information Bureau spokesman met with news reporters this morning. There were more questioners than usual. Ishii declared that the Japanese government intends to do its best to resolve the pending issues between the two countries peacefully through the US-Japan talks in Washington, until the last moment. When asked what the so-called last moment means, Ishii replied, "I cannot say when the last moment will arrive. We must endure." He also said that the three Japanese ships sailing to the United States have nothing to do with the talks. This was negotiated separately. These are not ships for evacuating overseas Chinese. If we want to evacuate Japanese expatriates in the United States, it would take a thousand ships to carry them back. The purpose of the departure of these three ships is to avoid the滞留of passengers. What is hoped now is that the departure of these three ships may allow Pacific shipping to resume. But the real big picture is not so sweet. None of the three ships carries cargo, because the last ship caused a private lawsuit due to the goods that were requested to be frozen.

Tokyo, 14th (Reuters) The "Asahi Shimbun" published a commentary today, saying that imitating Germany in everything cannot always be successful. We should adhere to our own principles in East Asia, it said.

### Japan's Economy; On the Brink of Despair

Singapore, 14th (Reuters) The British ship "Anhui" arrived here this morning from Japan, carrying more than a hundred evacuating British expatriates. The Australian Ambassador to Japan, Latham, was also one of the passengers. Because there was no place to settle on land, most of the British expatriates still went to the ship, waiting for the ship to carry them to Australia and New Zealand. Some evacuees told Reuters reporters that Japan is now gradually realizing that any further aggressive actions will make it confront a union of the most powerful countries, or will suffer adversity. Japan's current state of isolation must end when the Japanese people understand that the warlords are the root cause of all disputes. Only by abandoning their policies can they be saved from disaster. Japan is now almost willing to avoid war with the United States at any cost, and at the same time the economic situation is quite serious, and it is on the brink of despair. The Japanese people are now realizing for the first time that they have no trustworthy friends, it is said.

The US soldiers unanimously expressed condolences and sympathy to the Dutch East Indies Army.

London, 14th (Reuters) Batavia Reports The "Tai" Telegraph says Lieutenant General Baron Van Cholen Shawde, Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch East Indies Army, died yesterday in a plane crash near the new Batavia airport. Earlier, Baron Van Cholen Shawde went to Batavia to welcome Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command, who had passed by Batavia on his way to Australia, to hold talks. After the event, he took a military plane back to Bandung, the location of the Dutch East Indies Army Headquarters, but unexpectedly, the plane caught fire and crashed shortly after taking off. The fire brigade rushed to the scene, but was unable to rescue the people in the plane. The pilot and two Dutch East Indies junior officers also died. It is reported that Baron Van Cholen Shawde had an important mission and unfortunately died prematurely. As for the plane crash, it is said that it was caused by a sudden engine failure. It is known that Baron Van Cholen Shawde was originally a low-ranking officer in the Dutch East Indies "Forest Army" and was promoted for his merits. The strict defense of the Dutch East Indies army today is largely due to Baron Van Cholen Shawde's planning. Not long after the accident, Brooke-Popham left Batavia for Surabaya.

Baron Van Cholen Shawde did his best to organize and strengthen the Dutch East Indies national defense. The Dutch East Indies defense force is an important factor in protecting the Pacific. Baron Van Cholen Shawde's sudden death is truly a major loss for the Far East (14th dispatch).

### Central Route Red Army Reinforcements Stall German Advance

Soviet Capital's Long-Term Defense Works Completed; Red Army Counter-Offensive Successful at Leningrad

TASS, Moscow, 14th – *Izvestia* reports that the German command claims the outcome of the war will be decided in the Vyazma area. The German command originally planned to use pincer tactics and aerial bombardment to crush our army's resistance and reach Moscow within 24 hours. The German side continues to send reinforcements and heavily bombard our stations in an attempt to prevent our reinforcements from arriving, but our transportation has not been disrupted. Although the Germans have broken through our defenses in some areas, they have not destroyed the Red Army's resistance. The Red Army is fighting stubbornly and stopping the enemy's advance. One of our units destroyed dozens of German tanks and 140 trucks in six days, annihilating 8,000 enemy soldiers. During the same period, our army destroyed 205 enemy tanks and 605 motorcycles in the Vyazma area. Since the launch of the new offensive, the enemy has been trying to gain air superiority, but the situation has changed in the past few days. Our army has gained the upper hand and is protecting the highways. Captain Grunicky's team personally shot down 11 enemy aircraft in aerial combat, which is especially commendable. In the evening, our air force launched a fierce attack on enemy motorized units and infantry.

TASS, Moscow, 14th – A *Pravda* reporter says that the German offensive in the Vyazma area has slowed down due to increased Red Army resistance. German tanks and motorized units are making a show of force. In a certain area of Vyazma, encountering resistance from our tanks, they turned to a flanking attack. The sky over Vyazma has also become a battlefield. Enemy aircraft are bombing our stations and highways day and night, and our air force is also bombing enemy units, blocking their advance near the station. Fierce fighting is taking place in G town, continuing, and at point K, our army launched a counter-offensive, driving the enemy out. One of our tank units repeatedly repelled enemy soldiers, destroying 96 enemy tanks and 22 armored vehicles, annihilating 1,500 enemy officers and soldiers. Although the enemy is numerically superior, they are still trying to advance, but our defenses have been strengthened. The long-term defense works (such as anti-tank lines) to defend the Soviet capital are nearing completion. Reinforcements are constantly rushing to the front lines. The Red Army is determined to defend every inch of Soviet territory and fight to the last ounce of strength.

United Press, London, 10th – Moscow Radio reported yesterday that the Soviet army has launched a counter-offensive in the Leningrad area, and that Soviet troops are attacking point E, which the Germans are using as a base. Naval infantry from the Baltic Fleet have disembarked from warships and landed behind German lines, attacking point E from the north. The northern part of point E is now in Soviet hands.

Soviet Fresh Troops Well-Equipped; Combat Morale Extremely High

Reuters, London, 14th – Well-informed sources in London claim that the German advance in the central part of the Soviet front has indeed slowed down compared to the first two or three days. If the slowing of their advance is due to the Soviet forces clearing behind the German lines, then the Germans will not be able to launch attacks on the same scale as they did when the invasion began two weeks ago for another two or three weeks. There have been no further reports on the German advance towards Erzheev, and other German routes of advance in the central region seem to have made little progress. Fierce fighting is currently ongoing. The Germans are trying to annihilate Soviet troops behind their lines. There are signs that the Soviet side is deploying reserve troops to fight. Recent news reports that both the German and Soviet sides are rushing reserve troops to the extremely important central region, where the two armies are fighting day and night along a hundred-mile front west of Moscow. After the Soviet army abandoned Bely, the Germans are now trying to take advantage of the situation and advance. A front-line dispatch from the Soviet *Pravda* stated that the steadfast resistance of the Soviet army has indeed curbed the eastward advance of the German forces on the Vyazma front, and that fresh Soviet troops are constantly being sent to the front. These fresh troops are well-equipped and are units that have been through fierce fighting and sent to the rear for rest. Their combat morale is extremely high. A special communiqué from Hitler's headquarters claimed that the enemy troops captured in the battles of Bely and Vyazma now total over 350,000. As for the situation of the Red Army surrounded near Bely, as reported by the German side, Moscow has not mentioned it. Semi-official German sources say that these Soviet troops are now doing their best to break out, with their formations widely dispersed, attacking German positions in lines of fifteen men, but have been repelled by German artillery fire. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the Soviet army defending Leningrad has not only stopped the German attack, but is also launching fierce counter-offensives in some areas. One counter-offensive lasted for three days from October 8th to 10th, killing 1,500 German soldiers and wounding even more. The Soviet army also destroyed and captured 18 field guns and three mortars. The Soviet air force's assistance to ground operations is another feature of recent battles. On October 10th alone, Soviet aircraft destroyed three German tanks, four oil trucks, and over a hundred vehicles on this front. In one village, the German army had set up extensive barbed wire defenses, but the Soviet army still repeatedly stormed into the village and fought the Germans from house to house. Near Moscow, four German aircraft were shot down on Saturday, and another twelve were shot down on Sunday. German aircraft flew in formations or individually to raid Moscow on Sunday but were repelled. An air raid alert was issued briefly in Moscow at night, and anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, but it lasted only a short time.

Soviet Claims of Fierce Resistance; Red Army Withdraws from Vyazma

Reuters, Moscow, 14th – A Soviet midnight communiqué stated that the Soviet army under General Boldin withdrew from Vyazma (120 miles west of Moscow) after resisting German attacks for many days. The German army constantly brought fresh troops and equipment to the fierce fighting in the area, so it always maintained numerical superiority. Before retreating, the Soviet army inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, such as the loss of 96 German aircraft in one week. The communiqué also stated that 122 German aircraft were shot down or destroyed on airfields on October 11th, while the Soviet army lost 27 aircraft. Seven German aircraft were shot down near Moscow yesterday.

German Army Rushes Armored Units; Attempting to Break Through to Moscow

Reuters, London, 14th – Hours after the Soviet General Staff announced the withdrawal from Vyazma, 140 miles west of Moscow, Moscow Radio reported that the German army is now rushing a large number of armored units and infantry in an attempt to make a new attempt to break through to Moscow along the Vyazma highway. The situation around Vyazma is said to be "very serious." German forces have penetrated Soviet defense lines in several places. News from the southern front suggests that Axis forces are making progress in their advance on Kharkov. According to a Soviet midday communiqué, Soviet air force artillery and tank units are extremely active in the Leningrad area. Soviet dive-bomber squadrons bombed and destroyed 120 trucks full of enemy soldiers, ten oil trucks, and several tanks near Stomovik.

Germany Unable to Achieve Decisive Victory; War to Become a Stalemate

Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 13th – The new factor that the Soviet Union expects from the German-Soviet war, namely the early arrival of a cold winter, has now been realized. This new factor is enough to affect the northern war. The Red Army is now steadily opening the forward line to reinforce, so that it can assist the Red Army under General Timoshenko to defend Moscow. All of these reinforcements have winter equipment. In terms of the previous battle situation, although the German army has won a major victory, it is not decisive. It cannot be said to be decisive until the main force of the Red Army is annihilated or Moscow is surrounded. Not only that, the German advance is now slower than it was a few days ago. On this 700-mile front, the German offensive and the Red Army's defense forces have become evenly matched. The entire war situation seems likely to become a stalemate.

### US Government Authorities Advocate Revising Neutrality Act

Merchant Ship Arming Ban Should Be Lifted; Even at the Risk of Entering War

Reuters, Washington, 14th – Secretary of State Hull testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday during its review of the bill to repeal the ban on arming merchant ships. He first presented his views, urging Congress to quickly amend the Neutrality Act to allow the arming of merchant ships, stating that the danger of Nazi forces conquering the world is becoming increasingly serious, and the United States cannot avoid it. Germany has consistently abused attacks on undefended ships of the United States and other countries in the war, without giving any warning or making arrangements for the safety of the crew. He personally also advocated abolishing or amending the articles prohibiting American merchant ships from entering combat zones. Hitler disregards everything and intends to rule the high seas, and at the time the merchant ship arming ban was implemented, the United States never imagined that it would abandon its right to self-defense when the American continent was threatened. The Nazi plan to conquer the world is extraordinary, so many Americans do not yet know the danger their country is facing because of this plan. If the free people who have not yet been conquered do not understand the magnitude of the Nazi plan and the cruelty of its unlimited ambitions, they will suffer greatly from it. The theory of the Neutrality Act is that the United States can escape danger, but know that danger is therefore coming before us. We are facing an emergency situation today, and we should not sit idly by and let the legal articles tie our hands. If Hitler were to defeat Britain and gain control of the high seas, we would suddenly see danger reach our doorstep. Secretary of War Stimson also spoke to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, echoing Hull's call for the immediate repeal of the articles prohibiting the arming of merchant ships, and pointed out that these articles insulted the nation. He believed that the cancellation of this ban would greatly increase the safety of American merchant ships and restore America's sense of dignity on the seas. He said that judging from recent history, this ban has in practice prevented American ships from sailing to the ports of countries that Congress has now publicly recognized as fighting our common enemy, completely failing to achieve the original legislative purpose. He believes that opening up the war zone can make American national defense more solid, and that our ability to load munitions on our own ships and deliver them directly to their destinations can truly implement the policy of the Lend-Lease Act set by Congress. In his view, the danger that the United States will therefore face is far less than the danger that the countries that are working to resist the common enemy will be insecure if the United States hesitates and does not implement the purpose of the Lend-Lease Act. Secretary of the Navy Knox spoke next, also advocating the speedy repeal of the merchant ship arming ban, saying that watching Britain fail would be very harmful, while allowing merchant ships to arm would be less dangerous. The American people now all know that the United States must help the countries fighting Germany, even at the risk of its own war.

### Britain Determined to Aid Allies

Rush-Producing 30,000 Tanks; Providing to Soviet Union as Much as Possible

Reuters, London, 14th – A Reuters political reporter said that Beaverbrook's speech to the world on Sunday night meant that from now on, Britain would manufacture tanks, aircraft, and artillery every week to supply the Soviet Union. Britain has a very broad task, and Beaverbrook's goal of 30,000 tanks is the largest undertaking in the mechanical industry. In addition, a large number of various guns, ammunition, and aircraft must be built to help the Allies and equip the domestic army. Britain also has a major problem, which is to form a large army with excellent equipment and training. To achieve this goal, industry must make greater sacrifices, so that every able-bodied man who can be transferred can receive military training.

### Soviet Union to Send Mission to Reciprocate London Visit

Led by Litvinov; British Trade Union Representatives Arrive in Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 14th – A political reporter for the *Daily Express* said that several major Soviet politicians are likely to come to London to continue discussions recently held in Moscow. First, Molotov may be sent to England, but Molotov is too busy with official duties to free himself, so it is now believed that Litvinov may lead a Soviet mission to England.

Reuters, Moscow, 14th – Walter Citrine, General Secretary of the British Trades Union Congress, and several British trade union representatives have now arrived in Moscow.

### Japanese-Dutch Talks Underway

Reuters, Tokyo, 14th – Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told reporters today that talks between Japan and the Dutch East Indies are still underway and progressing smoothly. Several points have already been resolved.

### Germany Disrupts British Broadcast

Reuters, London, 14th – The BBC discovered strange noises disrupting its broadcast program last night, repeatedly interjecting questions such as, "Do you know that Churchill got a lot of money from the Jews? Is Churchill treating you fairly?" and "We are going to be sold to the United States. We don't want an American government, we want a people's government." When the radio station announced that troops from the autonomous territories were continuing to sail to Britain, this strange voice suddenly broadcast, "Poor them, they don't want to fight for Britain anymore." Broadcasting experts believe that this disruption came from the German side.

Random Talks on the European War (VIII) (5)

### The Soviet Rear and Front Lines

So what is the situation on the Soviet front line? The following is a telegraphic dispatch from a Reuters special correspondent at the front, from the town of Yalnya in the Smolensk region:

I am now writing this front-line report in Yalnya, this is an important town recovered by the Red Army after months of bloody fighting and the annihilation of eight German divisions in the central salient. It has been almost a week since the authorities allowed me to inspect the front line for the first time after leaving Moscow. During that time, I have traveled many roads, all of which are unbelievable roads in the eastern Smolensk region.

I have spoken with soldiers, these heroes will participate in the entire war, and ultimately make the German attempt to go straight to Moscow, a failure. They have also personally participated in the past battles to recover large areas of lost territory. I have dined outdoors with a divisional commander, only a mile from the front line, where the two artillery teams are fighting fiercely. I have spent a night in a front-line artillery team, and I have slept one night on a stretcher in a front-line ambulance team.

I have spoken with air force soldiers who have just returned from bombing German airfields on the Smolensk side. In the Vyazma area, I encountered bombing. On this recovered Soviet land, I saw many villages completely destroyed by artillery fire and bombs. The tombs of fallen German and Russian soldiers are everywhere. I saw many tragic scenes. I saw countless "Guernicas" (Guernica is a Spanish city that was bombed by the German Air Force during the Spanish Civil War). I saw many towns and villages wantonly burned by German "terrorist air raids."

I have spoken with residents who have been bankrupted and still followed the army back to their hometowns. I also saw women milking cows, and children playing freely even though they were miles away from the front line and the sound of artillery roaring through the autumn sky. I saw anger and resentment. But I did not see any loss of morale.

I asked about a recovered village, and it gave me an unforgettable impression. This village, unlike other villages, still had a few houses surviving, but there were only one farmer, three children, and one blind woman, who had gone insane due to the horrors of war. I saw her wandering everywhere, always carrying with her all her possessions! A bucket, a sheepskin, and a few rags. But the three children were already busy digging sweet potatoes in the recovered fields.

The area to the east of here had been ravaged by the German army, and later the Red Army launched a pincer offensive from the west, defeating the German army. As a result of this pincer offensive, tens of thousands of German troops were killed or captured, and the remaining troops had to retreat in a hurry, abandoning several strongholds and a large amount of equipment.

The German army is now continuing to be forced to retreat eleven miles west of Yalnya. Although Smolensk is in the hands of the German army, the Red Army is not far from the city. The only relatively complete building in Yalnya is a church. The town previously had only 5,000 residents, but after the catastrophe, only a few chimneys and piles of rubble and ashes remained. A large group of residents was surrounded by the sudden German army, and were then formed into labor teams and sent to the rear of the German army. No one knows their fate. But some escaped into the forest or managed to escape to the Red Army's position, and some are still returning one after another, but there is really no place to live in the town.

On the night of September 4th, when the German army decided to withdraw from the town, they ordered the remaining hundreds of residents (mostly the old, weak, and children) to gather in the church and locked it from the outside. Before retreating, the German army set fire to the houses that had been destroyed by artillery fire, and the Red Army re-entered the town in this hell of flames.

I walked along a road that the German army retreated from before abandoning Yalnya. I set off from Duroguboź in the morning, a city that had never fallen, but was almost completely destroyed after the German army carried out a terrorist air raid in July. In the dark night, a carriage traveled through an unnamed town. In the town, only burned houses could be seen, with the sky exposed in the window holes, like boneless skeletons, which was really terrifying.

After wading through deep mud, I finally reached a military hut, where the local commander hosted me for dinner, and there was a pile of firewood as a place to rest.

On the morning of September 23rd, I drove through this town that looked like a broken tire. It is common for the army to take care of homeless refugees, but life in the surrounding villages seems extremely comfortable, although the roofs of many thatched huts have been bombed off, and there are many holes made by artillery shells on the side of the road. There are many pigs and geese on the road. Chickens, etc. But the situation is completely different once you enter the "no-man's land" and the area that has been systematically destroyed or looted by the German army.

The Red Army divided its troops into three routes, advancing step by step and consolidating its position for several weeks, until the German army could no longer support it and finally collapsed. The German army had built many winding trenches. At a distance of 500 yards, there were many trenches built by the Red Army overnight. Between the two types of trenches, there were sawtooth-shaped gaps, which were used as cover when the Red Army rushed towards the German positions.

The German position was full of shell holes, which proved that the Red Army's artillery fire was extremely accurate. The intensity of this war can be seen from a grave decorated with wildflowers and branches, where the corpses of thousands of Red Army soldiers lay. The bodies of German soldiers filling the shell holes have now been buried.

The positions are littered with German equipment, newspapers, helmets, and even private letters. (End)

### Cotton Yarn: Double Horse Yarn Frequently Hitting the Stop Limit; Demonstrating That Steps Are Disordered

The yarn market continued to soar, and the price increase was quite dramatic. This was because cash prices were soaring, which led speculators to unanimously view prices as rising. Furthermore, with the arrival of new capital, although the export of cotton yarn was banned, buyers still flocked in, saying that although raw materials were loose, factory costs were related. Some also said that cotton textiles have received permits and can be transported to the occupied areas, so the buying trend is even stronger. In fact, it is mostly wishful thinking. How can a piece of fat meat fall into someone else's mouth? Even if there are benefits, it will not be your turn. However, the new peak of the Double Horse factory is emerging endlessly. The opening price in the morning fell to 2,160 yuan, but in an instant it reached 2,180 yuan, announcing a stop limit. However, off-market transactions were still thriving. In this fueling of the flames, the highest price reached 2,200 yuan. In the afternoon, because the off-market transactions in the morning had exceeded the stop limit to a level beyond the scope, business was not allowed in the afternoon. At first, it was called 2,210 yuan, but no transaction was made. Afterwards, it was still in the range of 2,180-90 yuan, which proves that the steps are disordered. It is also said that the exchange, in view of the recent wild ups and downs and the huge risks, has a saying that it will increase the margin for each broker.

Double Horse opened in the morning with a strong momentum, because the prices on each exchange on the previous day all announced a stop limit. The upward trend continued, and the opening price was 2,160 yuan. After a short while, it rose to 2,180 yuan, announcing a stop limit. The off-market price reached 2,195 yuan. Then, profit-takers spat out their profits, and at the same time, the exchange's second-round price fell back, dropping continuously to 2,125 yuan. However, the bullish intentions were still strong, and it went to 2,175 yuan again. However, there were looser chips on the table, which could be seen loosening to 2,120 yuan. However, as soon as the price was low, buyers stepped in again and gradually rose to 2,185 yuan. It was found that the daily turnover statistics of 10,000 bales were all intra-trade bouncing ball transactions.

The Jin Double Horse futures market situation was volatile and the trend was greatly disordered. When it opened in the morning, the factory continued the remaining momentum from the previous day, and under the pull of the bullish force and the supplement of the bearish competition, it announced a stop limit again. Therefore, in order to pursue the evidence relationship, the opening was delayed until ten o'clock. At that time, it happened that the exchange rose and then tired, and the spot yarn also tended to decline. Therefore, the October contract opened at 1,950, the November contract opened at 1,970, and the December contract opened at 1,980. After entering the market, there were many floating short selling orders, and the trend was continuously tiring. The near-term contract once fell to 1,920, the November contract also fell slightly to 1,945, and the December contract fell to 1,945. Until near noon, it was suddenly seen that the exchange and the spot market rebounded one after another, and people's hearts were mostly upward again. The futures yarn market advanced slowly. At noon, except for the near-term soft squeeze, the distant-term contracts were all good by more than twenty yuan. In the afternoon, the first was firm and then small, and all opened at high prices. After retail investors poured out their profits, they then declined one after another. As a result, the near-term contract fell by three yuan, the December contract was squeezed down by one yuan, and the November contract was uniquely good by thirty yuan because the price difference with the near-term market price was low. Looking at the trend, although the yarn market has been caused by the contraction of the black exchange rate and the lack of floral clothing, which have caused the biggest reason for the rise, the common radical rise is too fast, inevitably causing the seller to not be able to breathe. The fatigue is also inevitable. The list is shown below.

### The Arrogance of Coarse Cotton Grows Daily – What About the Lack of Demand from Factories?

Spot cotton continues to be firm, and prices are quite high. The strength of coarse cotton's momentum is increasing daily, but demand from factories has not improved. However, most people expect prices to rise, mainly because of low inventory, and there are no other major reasons.

Tongzhou Packing: 100 bales, 517.0

Changyinsha Packing: 100 bales, 517.0

Xinhang Cotton: 100 bales, 545.0

New York Cotton Market: Yesterday was Columbus Day, commemorating the discovery of the New World. The cotton market was closed as usual.

Indian Cotton Market: Prices initially fell due to selling pressure from sellers, but then rose due to short covering and buying by dealers. Yesterday's closing prices rose by one to seven rupees. It is predicted that today's opening market will be very flat, with little difference compared to the closing price.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Spot cotton conditions are relatively firm, due to strong demand from factories and sellers continuing to be reluctant to easily sell their holdings. Transactions are slightly less. As for direct ordering of foreign cotton, although there is no lack of enthusiasm, purchase intentions are not strong due to foreign exchange and shipping issues.

### Piece Goods - Prices Too High, Peers Taking Profits and Selling Off See Weakness

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was firm and rising, because factories refused to open futures contracts, and hoarders searched the market. However, due to a lack of spot sales, some took profits and sold off. Supply and demand were balanced. Selling prices were slightly higher. White cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and twill increased by 0.035 to 0.075 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth and flannel were stable, and sales were sluggish. The most active trading on this street was over 1,000 pieces.

Eastern Cloth: On the exchange, distant months of futures cloth rose by 0.05 to 0.08 yuan in the morning session. In the afternoon, due to foreign firms and peers expecting weakness, prices gradually declined, resulting in a decrease of 0.03 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the spot market remained stable. Although it fluctuated with the sudden rise and fall of Shuangma Yarn, as soon as it fell sharply, the fundamentals quickly tightened, and the rebound force was also fast. The highest price for fine cloth from leading factories exceeded 68 yuan, but the closing price was still slightly lower at 67.4 yuan, down 0.02 yuan. There was little change in mid-range fine cloth and fine twill. Sijunzi Serge closed in the evening at 2.4475 yuan, a slight increase of 0.0025 yuan.

### Grain - Inland Rice Prices Have Eased, Shanghai Rice Prices Are Even Tighter

—Without Removing Hoarders… The Rice Crisis Will Not End—

Yesterday's early market for foreign rice saw new hoarding giants, both internal and external, continuing to absorb supplies, attacking each other at times. Yinzhan xiaojiao (Silver Shop Small Trade) jumped to 138 yuan, while other shops also reached 137.5 yuan. At this time, general profit-taking speculators took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and the original source goods were successively pushed out. With selling momentum strong, the market was suddenly crowded with goods, and trading atmosphere was frustrated, forming a situation of more selling than buying. Prices gradually fell back. In this way, prices plummeted, directly approaching Yinzhan xiaojiao falling to 133.5 yuan, and other shops to 133 yuan. Internal and external giants took advantage of the cheap prices to absorb again, and local sales also made some small purchases, so the situation began to tighten again. Prices rebounded again. As a result, the closing prices were Yinzhan xiaowen (Silver Shop Small Pattern) at 135.5 yuan, other shops at 134.5 yuan, Saigon Grade 1 high-grade at 148.5 yuan, down to 145.5 yuan, Grade 2 at 138 yuan, 136 yuan, Siam Grade 1 at 143 yuan, 142 yuan, Grade 2 at 136 yuan, down to 132.5 yuan, Qiaofo Rice special grade from 146 yuan, decided to 142 yuan, Mindang 144 yuan 140 yuan, then 130 yuan, broken tip 111 yuan, then to 108.5 yuan.

Rice shipments continue to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan ship arrived at the port yesterday morning, carrying 10,800 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. This foreign rice is the Shanghai Municipal Council's low-price Rangoon rice, transported from Shanghai to Shanghai, (Zu).

Both thick and thin new broken Japonica and new Dujian National Rice are arriving vigorously, and sales are still sluggish. However, due to the repeated soaring of foreign rice, cargo owners are unwilling to easily sell due to the arrival of goods, resulting in a stalemate. Prices have also risen by 2 to 3 yuan. Kainan Port early broken at 197 yuan, 156 yuan, Kunshan new Japonica at 156 yuan, 154 yuan, Qingjiao Kiln variety at 155-156 yuan. However, the new Dujian alone is rare and widely sold, and can compete with foreign rice, with a sudden increase of 4 to 5 yuan, calculated at 137 yuan, then to 134 yuan. However, it is heard that inland rice prices are all within 100 yuan. The reason why Shanghai rice prices are so expensive is that, on the one hand, the source is restricted, and on the other hand, the wind of hoarding and price increases is too strong in Shanghai, with a great trend of non-hoarding. Rice prices are difficult to fall.

Glutinous rice continues to be firm due to the scarcity of goods, continuing to rise by about 2 yuan along with foreign rice. Hong Kong White Yuan is high from 152 yuan, then to 148.5 yuan, Glutinous Mung Bean is 140 yuan.

### The Rise of Flour Was Too Rapid, and a Reversal Has Begun

Yesterday's foreign flour market, due to the excessive rise the previous day, saw early market profit-taking bulls and giants taking the opportunity to sell off. In addition, the rise of 2 yuan the previous day was stimulated by US dollar notes. Yesterday, the dollar notes fell back, and the flour market was bound to follow with a sharp decline. Therefore, the opening price of Fort Morning was slightly higher at 40 yuan, at 39.8 yuan. Dongzhan Jinlong (East Shop Golden Dragon) fell to 38.6 yuan, and Xizhan (West Shop) fell to 37.9 yuan, a sharp drop of 1 yuan compared to the high price the previous evening. However, as soon as the market price was low, local customers, various households, and new bullish speculators took advantage of the low prices to absorb. In the afternoon, market prices gradually rebounded. However, the mood had stabilized, and buying interest was not as strong as the previous day. Fort afternoon had reached 40.045 yuan, closing slightly lower by 0.01 yuan. Jinlong Dongzhan arrived in the afternoon at 39.2 yuan, closing at 39 yuan. Xizhan's afternoon closing price was 38.6 yuan, so it was slightly lower by 0.02-0.03 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no market for local flour. Bran was in short supply, with small packages reaching a high of 40 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous market. Wheat was in short supply and even more outstanding.

### New Red Beans Have Been Launched on the Market

New red beans have recently been launched on the market. There are small shipments from various places. According to investigations, this year's harvest is acceptable, with about 50-60% yield. However, due to difficulties in transportation and high costs, the selling price is very expensive. Yesterday, the opening price for Tianjin new red beans was 105 yuan, Qingdao new red beans 108 yuan, Chongming New Sand red beans 120 yuan, with a total transaction volume of nearly 100 bales.

### Finance – How Can Such a Rise Last? Gold Prices Have Fallen

Yesterday's dark market for smelted gold, although the unprecedented rise has been suppressed, the storm is still in a dangerous state. The trend of spot gold on that day first rose and then fell. Spot gold initially inherited the high momentum of the previous day, and even saw an unprecedented high price of 11,400 yuan. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai West gang and Tianjin gang suddenly started to sell off. Foreign exchange reports eased, and the price once retreated to 10,850 yuan. The Xiangchao gang strongly bought in. At noon, the plate traded outside 11,100 yuan. In the afternoon, both gangs continued to buy in. A certain bank also bought in 500 taels, while the Tianjin gang sold 800 taels. Cash houses also competed to sell. From 11,160 yuan, the final price closed slightly lower at 11,100 yuan, a decrease of 200 yuan, with a transaction volume of over 2,000 taels. Futures prices also fluctuated, initially retreating to the 8,000 yuan level along with spot gold, but the Chaozhou gang and Guangzhou gang strongly bought in, and prices rose twice to 8,400 yuan, but ultimately could not hold and fell back down, a decrease of 20 yuan, with a transaction volume of 2,200 to 2,300 taels.

Decheng and Lianxing each bought 10 taels from Chengji for 11,400 yuan. The Tianjin gang Yiyuan strongly sold over 300 taels, and Xianghe, Defu, and Tianyuan competed to sell. Foreign exchange reports eased, and prices reversed, retreating to 950 yuan, falling within 11,000 yuan, and dropping to 10,850 yuan. Chengji resumed buying. Shike, Xiangxing Yong, and a certain bank continued to absorb supplies. At noon, the market reappeared, reaching 11,100 yuan at noon closing. In the afternoon, Xiangxing also made the first purchase, making a high of 60 yuan, for 11,160 yuan, sold by Xianghe for 100 taels, and Defu sold 190 taels.

### Exporters Slightly Offer, Black Market Exchange is Extracted

Foreign Currency Falls Back Quickly

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, both the Central Bank and HSBC exchange rates were flat. The small counters of HSBC, etc., did not change their prices. The black market for British and American exchange initially tightened and then eased slightly. Although ten so-called foreign banks had absolutely stopped supplying and demanding foreign exchange, exporters and Chinese speculators sold off private positions, and the import of generally so-called non-essential goods also weakened due to the excessively high prices. After opening in the morning, the US exchange rate was once shouted at only 3 yuan. This was not a formal market price, but a shouting price. Shortly after, it was heard that exporters sold US exchange to importing foreign firms at 3.125 yuan, which was also a small transaction price where buyers were eager to buy in regardless of the expensive price. The market situation was not as chaotic as in the previous few days. Late in the evening, the British exchange rate was 2 shillings 0.0625, and the US dollar was 3.375 yuan, both having buyers, compared to the previous day, the British tightened by 0.125, and the US tightened by 0.25.

Yesterday's foreign currency market, the British and American gold pounds fell by 5 yuan along with the spot gold price. The British gold notes also showed a slightly weak trend, while the US gold notes still fluctuated greatly, initially rising to 34.5 yuan, and finally retreating to 31.2 yuan, a decrease of 2.3 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes still lacked demand, and market prices continued to rise. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended lower, with the former retreating to 2.6 yuan and the latter falling to 2.1 yuan.

### Securities – As Long as There is Normal Trading, Why Worry About Public Bonds Not Rising? Foreign Stocks Fluctuate Greatly

Over-the-counter trading of government bonds, yesterday's market suddenly rose again, with a very strong monthly increase. Such repeated changes made the general public feel like they were in a fog. Initially, the mood was still uncertain. When Class C bonds first opened, the market price was still 69 yuan. Subsequently, profit-taking short covering caused most shorts to buy in. However, the "Sichuan Gang" stood idly by, the mood gradually stabilized, and the selling power was weak. Class A bonds gradually rose from over 5 yuan to over 7 yuan, and Class C bonds also broke through the 70 yuan mark. It can be seen that although there is a large supply of chips in the market, large investors are naturally buying in. It is only hoped that there are no hidden malicious forces. Even if there is a sharp drop, recovery is also very easy. Yesterday morning, the initial opening was very weak. Class A bonds were only 75.3 yuan, and Class C bonds had been 69 yuan. Then, Xinhua, Yitai, Xinfu, and Hu Heji Renfeng successively bought in, either covering shorts or adding to longs. Although Jiufeng, Hongda Datong Kang, and Yizhong sold off, the noon closing was approaching the 70 yuan mark. In the afternoon, Jiufeng, Yitai, and Yuxing had the strongest buying interest. Shengda, Tiansheng, and Delong also bought in, while Runde, Jiucheng, Hongda Datong, and Xingchang all sold off. However, Class C bonds broke through 70 yuan again, and Class A bonds reached over 7 yuan. However, silver was very tight, and the bulls were slightly affected. As a result, market prices all rose by 0.75 to 1.2 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 1.8 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 200 shares of Star Perfumery were traded at a price of 130 yuan per share.

The public stock market is still strong. Fluctuations were very large in the morning, and slightly stabilized in the afternoon. At the close, the stocks softened again. As a result, stocks rose and fell unevenly.

London, 13th (Monday) Wire Report: Today's quoted prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat. Bank stocks showed mixed trends. The stock of Mercantile Bank fell by one shilling and three pence, priced at 9 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9 pence. The stock of HSBC (London Registration) rose by half a pound, priced at 81 pounds. There were no other changes.

### Sugar Market - It is Heard That Futures Sugar Will be Forcibly Settled

Yesterday's sugar market, after the huge waves caused the day before, caused company aspects to feel very tricky in a short time regarding the situation of customer offsets. Therefore, the market is still suspended, and it must wait until the settlement is clear before it can recover. It is heard that there will be a forced settlement, so let's record it and see. Public Association drawing plate, 24 coarse white, September imports were 215 yuan, then back to 208 yuan to 04 yuan. The afternoon was also tight first and then loose, the initial plate was 208 yuan, low to 06 yuan 03 yuan, August cargo was 211 yuan to 02 yuan, 200 yuan, afternoon 06 yuan to 4 yuan 1 yuan, Hong Kong coarse was 198 yuan to 95 yuan 90 yuan, afternoon 97 yuan 95 yuan 90 yuan 88.5 yuan, Dutch red was 185 yuan to 80 yuan 76.5 yuan, afternoon 183 yuan to 80 yuan 77 yuan, Taikoo Car White B Mark was 205 yuan, afternoon 202 yuan, HX Mark was 190 yuan, compared to the previous market, the spectrum rose about 9 yuan to 10 yuan, the trend is still tight, with a total transaction volume of over 25,000 bags.

A large amount of sugar arrived in Shanghai. A certain Dutch ship that arrived in port last Saturday carried a large amount of sugar from Java, with a total of 90,000 bags, docking at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship arrived in Shanghai on the same day as the Dutch ship, carrying 3,300 bags of sugar from Hong Kong. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan ship arrived at the port yesterday morning, in addition to carrying the Municipal Council's foreign rice, and also carried 4,800 bags of sugar from Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea - Tea Leaves from All Sides Gather in Shanghai

Recently, tea has arrived in Shanghai from all sides. Since the freezing of Japanese capital, it has been inconvenient for Japanese tea to be shipped to the United States, so it is imported into Shanghai. Therefore, Japanese tea and Taiwanese tea have been constantly shipped to Shanghai recently, and so-called Chinese tea merchants come forward to repackage and ship it to the United States for sale. Pingshui Zhucha (Gunpowder Tea), because Shaoshao fell at the same time, over 100,000 boxes had already been rushed to Shanghai for sale. Recently, Chinese merchants have also invested in Japan to contract for sales, and tens of thousands of boxes will continue to be sold. Yesterday, 470 pieces of tea arrived from Hong Kong. Today (14th), 2,500 boxes of tea are being shipped to Tianjin, 67 boxes to Hong Kong, and 5 boxes to Siam.

### Speculation and Hoarding Collude – Methods to Curb Them Should Be Sought Quickly

Futures Trading on the Market Should Be Strictly Prohibited - Authorities Should Punish Those Who Wantonly Raise Prices

Cotton Imports May Be Able to Obtain Foreign Exchange in the Near Future

Illegal foreign exchange has been shrinking and fluctuating in the past 48 hours. Yesterday, German and Italian banks were selling off foreign exchange, so the exchange rate eased slightly. According to the Zi Lin West Newspaper, the foreign exchange situation in this city has not changed fundamentally. The Stabilization Fund is still maintaining its original method of supplying foreign exchange. It is reported that 25,000 tons of foreign rice have obtained foreign exchange, and other daily necessities can also obtain foreign exchange, so the market's panic is unnecessary. It is also learned that cotton imports can also obtain foreign exchange within two or three months. The Stabilization Fund's import trade management plan is at least unfavorable to speculative merchants, so there is a move to purchase US notes, and the market is therefore in a state of unconscious chaos.

Fixed Price of the Bureau's Rice – No Change Will Be Made

Yesterday, relevant parties indicated that although rice prices in the rice market have been rising due to the manipulation of speculative elements, the selling price of the Municipal Council's foreign rice (117 yuan in national currency per stone of 160 city catties) will not be affected and changed. In addition, the Municipal Council's foreign rice is supplied by Stell Brothers, an American company operating rice in Rangoon, Burma. Burma's annual production of 8 million tons of rice, in addition to half for self-use, the rest of the export business is mostly operated by the company. The amount of rice needed in this port is less than one-tenth of the company's exported rice, so there is no need to worry about the shortage of the Municipal Council's foreign rice needed in this city. Since the Municipal Council's foreign rice began to be handled in mid-May this year, the total number sold to citizens has reached more than 800,000 bags.

The Actual Sales Volume of Rice in the Market Decreased Greatly

At the end of last month, the price of rice in this port's small market once fell below 100 yuan, so general speculative elements felt greatly panicked, and then used the excuse of tension in Huandong Bureau and financial changes to gradually raise the price of rice to more than 130 yuan. General citizens then changed to eating the Municipal Council's foreign rice, resulting in each rice shop going to the Lijiyang line to register and purchase the Municipal Council's foreign rice every day, reaching over 7,000 bags, accounting for more than seven-tenths of the city's total rice sales. The actual sales volume of rice in the market was greatly reduced, and speculative elements also lost their basis for raising prices, resulting in yesterday's rice prices already showing a decline.

### Call for a Ban on Futures Trading

Yesterday, this newspaper received letters from readers, stating that the prices of goods at sea are rising daily, and the lives of the general public are becoming increasingly difficult. The only solution for now is to awaken the attention of the Municipal Council and quickly issue a strict order to prohibit all futures trading in all markets, so that speculators have nowhere to use their skills. I sincerely hope to make a high call and strongly advocate that we have no selfish intentions in this matter.

Special Sale of Essential Goods – Suggestion

Recently, rumors have been rife in the market, and people are recklessly believing them, giving market operators the opportunity to raise prices. Examining these rumors, their source is that recently some sugar merchants imported a large amount of sugar products and needed a lot of foreign exchange. They then vigorously absorbed foreign exchange from the "open market", spreading rumors that the black market would still be revived and that foreign exchange would be tightened again. Regardless of whether it is caused by these rumors, it is always a major blow to the people's livelihood, especially the salaried class. The authorities of the concession should do their best to find ways to stop the endless rise in prices. Some people suggest that the authorities adopt the Municipal Council's foreign rice method for various essential items such as coal, coal balls, sugar, oil, and grains. These could be sold exclusively by the authorities, because currently these types of goods are either being hoarded in large quantities and are unwilling to be sold, or are being speculated and overpriced by unscrupulous merchants for their own profit, which has a great impact on people's livelihood. Therefore, the relevant authorities may carry out transportation and sales by themselves or entrust them to experts, stipulate appropriate prices, and if necessary, distribute them to households. Although this move is difficult, it cannot be successful without the cooperation of all sectors, but in any case, prices are not impossible to suppress.

The Financial Community Plans to Curb Hoarding

Regarding the issue of settlement of import and export trade in Shanghai, various parties have been discussing it in recent days, and rumors have arisen along with it. According to the reporter of the New Sound Agency who inquired from the Friendly Bank yesterday, the Stabilization Fund Committee is still following its original intention regarding the management of foreign exchange in Shanghai. It refuses to provide foreign exchange for the import of non-essential goods unless specifically approved, and will provide convenience for essential goods. Because the purpose of the Stabilization Fund is to seek "the greatest good for the greatest number of people." The Stabilization Fund does not want to maintain Shanghai's trade, but to maintain the entire position of Shanghai. At present, the Stabilization Fund still has sufficient funds and can continue to supply legitimate needs. Furthermore, in order to prevent speculation, it will vigorously promote relevant banks to find ways to move floating capital into the mainland to facilitate construction. The reason why speculation and hoarding are so rampant in Shanghai is that there is too much floating capital and nowhere to allocate it, so it is used for improper purposes.

### The Ministry of Finance is Determined to Protect the Interests of Depositors

According to reports, there have been many newly established banks, money shops, silver shops, and trust companies in Shanghai recently. Although some of them have applied for approval in accordance with the law, there are also many who have opened without approval. Now, in order to protect the interests of depositors, the Ministry of Finance is determined to severely crack down on these shops that have not been approved and will not allow them to join the Silver and Money Industry Association as members. As for the shops that have been legally approved for establishment, they should abide by the Banking Law, the Savings Bank Law, and the Measures for the Management of Banks, and must not directly engage in commerce or hoard goods. Money shops should use deposits to invest in production and construction projects and joint production and sales projects as a principle. The mortgage loans they undertake should be limited to the proper business of the shops. If a loan has reached maturity and an extension is requested, the nature of the goods should also be investigated. If they are daily necessities for the people's livelihood, the borrower should be immediately ordered to sell them in order to prevent hoarding and speculation and manipulation of market prices.

### The Total Amount of Public Bonds in Various Provinces After the War is Only More Than 30 Million Yuan

The Ministry of Finance has approved the issuance of public bonds by the governments of various provinces after the war, totaling 30,482,000 yuan, with the surplus income from provincial land taxes, business taxes, slaughter taxes, and tungsten sand roads as a guarantee fund. Because the handling is extremely cautious, the number is very limited. The following is obtained by a reporter from the New Sound Agency: (1) Jiangsu's 29th Year Public Bonds for Reorganizing Local Finance totaled 10 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by land tax revenue; (2) Zhejiang's 27th Year 6% Public Bonds totaled 10 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by land tax revenue; (3) Anhui's 26th Year Public Bonds for Completing Highway Construction totaled 1 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by highway surplus, and the 29th Year Financial Public Bonds totaled 8 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by land tax revenue; (4) Jiangxi's 27th Year Construction Public Bonds totaled 20 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by tungsten sand revenue, and the 30th Year Construction Public Bonds totaled 30 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by tin ore and 125 salt surtax revenue; (5) Hubei's 26th Year Construction Public Bonds totaled 5 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by business tax revenue, and the 28th Year Highway Public Bonds totaled 8 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by the road's revenue; (6) Hunan's 27th Year Construction Public Bonds totaled 18 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by business revenue; (7) Sichuan's 26th Year Disaster Relief Public Bonds totaled 6 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by disaster relief reserve funds, and the 28th Year Construction Public Bonds totaled 7.5 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, guaranteed by land tax revenue, the 29th Year Construction Public Bonds totaled 7.5 million yuan, with an interest rate of 6%, (to be continued)

### Two Concessions Planning to Build Large-Scale Asylum

Projected to Accommodate Over Eight Thousand Beggars; Initial Year's Expenses Estimated at Over Six Million

A Continental Press report states that with the harsh winter approaching, Shanghai streets are increasingly seeing impoverished individuals freezing to death. Powerful public organizations are now dedicated to a plan to construct a large-scale beggar asylum, aiming to once and for all eliminate the serious beggar problem. Authorities from both concessions, along with representatives from the Salvation Army and Rotary Club, recently met to formulate this plan.

Felippe Presides Over Meeting

The meeting was chaired by Felippe, General Manager and President of the Public Works Department. A resolution was passed, agreeing in principle to study the plan to build a beggar asylum, larger in scale than the existing one on Singapore Road. The committee, currently being organized, will prepare a detailed report on this plan, roughly estimating initial expenses of six million five hundred thousand yuan for the first twelve months. It is said this large asylum will be located in the suburbs. Authorities from both concessions are striving to complete consultations and planning as quickly as possible. The Singapore Road asylum is also preparing to close.

All Beggars to Be Accommodated

Reportedly, the planned asylum, though with defined boundaries, can be expanded without limit. Beggars entering the asylum will not be repatriated to their hometowns but will be encouraged to stay, eventually transforming the asylum into a village-like settlement. Once a site is found, residential buildings such as dormitories and medical facilities will be constructed, and beggars from both within and outside the concessions will be brought into the asylum. Responsible personnel will provide food and clothing, teach them means of livelihood, and provide education. A major difficulty anticipated at that time is that most beggars are addicted to drugs, and they must first be weaned off before they can be educated.

Dockworkers Likely to Become Destitute

It is estimated that there are approximately eight thousand beggars in Shanghai, including those who beg as a profession or those forced to beg due to unemployment. Yesterday (the 13th), well-informed sources claimed that after the recent ban on Shanghai cotton exports, unemployment is bound to increase. Without means of livelihood, the only recourse is to beg to avoid hunger and cold. In past years, the beggar problem was entirely handled by the Public Works Department, which successively deported beggars outside the concessions in an attempt to drive them away. However, the beggars invariably re-entered the concessions. Later, the Salvation Army, with funds raised, established a beggar asylum at the intersection of Hart Road and Singapore Road. However, it can only accommodate a maximum of fifteen hundred people, still insufficient to address the entire beggar problem. Therefore, they appealed to the Public Works Department, which felt that proceeding alone would likely be ineffective. They requested the French Municipal Council to jointly discuss solutions. Once the large asylum is built, street beggars can be eliminated. If successful, not only will beggars have a place to live, but it will also be praised by the public.

### Four Banks to Handle Remittances to the Hinterland; Absorb Idle Capital

Following the Ministry of Economic Affairs' encouragement of Shanghai shops, factories, and financial institutions to transfer capital inland, subsidies are granted for relocation of factories, exemption from various taxes, and comprehensive insurance provided by the Central Trust Bureau. Remittances to the interior by the Four Banks are given favorable exchange rates, as reported previously. Various trade associations have now urged their members to implement this. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, and various commercial banks in different regions have all established methods for remittance to the hinterland, providing convenience for inland remittances and government guarantees for the safety of principal and interest. As a result, remittances from Shanghai to the hinterland have dramatically increased. In the first half of this year alone, inland capital transfer amounted to 850 million yuan. In July, August, and September, remittances handled by banks to the interior averaged over 200 million yuan per month. Consequently, the Shanghai-Chongqing-Kunming exchange rate has gradually balanced. Paying 880 yuan in Shanghai allows one to receive 1000 yuan in Chongqing. All inland remittance handling fees, transportation fees, and telegraph fees are completely waived. However, idle capital in Shanghai remains abundant, estimated at several tens of billions of yuan. The exact figure cannot be determined without a detailed investigation. It is hoped that continued efforts will be made to fulfill the government's mission of encouraging capital transfer inland.

### Telegram from Changsha: Foreigners Safe

According to a telegram received yesterday by foreigners in this city from Changsha, it stated that foreigners in Changsha are currently very safe. The twenty-three British and American expatriates, mostly serving in churches and hospitals, are continuing to work as usual. Miss Davis, an American Presbyterian missionary, and several British, German, and Italian missionaries, organized a refugee shelter when the war broke out, which was overseen by Mr. White, an American missionary. Now that order has been restored, it has been disbanded. As for the German and Italian missionaries, they will be evacuated from Changsha soon.

### Japanese Nationals Returning Home from Southeast Asia

Japanese nationals in various overseas locations are successively evacuating and returning to Japan by ship. The number of Japanese nationals who have returned in batches is estimated to be over four thousand. From June to September this year, the number of Japanese nationals evacuated from various places, according to investigation, is as follows: Dutch East Indies, two thousand six hundred and fourteen; Malaya, two hundred and twenty-two; Central and South America, two hundred and nineteen; Hawaii, one hundred and four; Burma, twelve; Australia, ten; Philippines, three hundred and sixty. The number of Japanese nationals evacuated from India and Malaya has been increasing recently.

### Overseas Postage to Double from Next Month

Airmail Postage Increases by Fifty Percent; Shanghai Post Office Yet to Receive Orders

Regarding the issue of postage increases, although rumors of implementation are widespread, the Kunming Administration is still in preparation, and various arrangements are insufficient. It has not yet been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval by the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, the implementation date, regarding domestic postage, still awaits the decision of the authorities and is not expected to be implemented this year. However, regarding

Overseas Portion

the Shanghai Bureau has hinted that it will be implemented in advance. Although the details of the increase have not been fully decided, according to reporters, it will increase by one hundred percent due to foreign exchange rates. Every ordinary mail item sent abroad, except for Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou Bay, Japan, Dalian, and Taiwan, will increase from fifty cents to one yuan. The registration fee, originally fifty cents, will also increase to one yuan. The express fee, originally one yuan, will increase to two yuan. This is calculated for every twenty grams, but if letters exceed

Twenty Grams

or the remaining fraction thereof, it will be increased from thirty cents to sixty cents according to current regulations, pending the post office's decision. How airmail rates will be increased is still unknown. According to the Sino-American route, flying from Shanghai to Hong Kong, it costs four yuan and twenty-five cents per five grams; flying to the Near East via the British Overseas Airways, it costs one yuan and eighty cents per five grams; to the Middle East and Africa, it costs three yuan and ninety cents; via the China Clipper to Europe, it costs five yuan and ninety cents per five grams. These rates are likely to increase by one-half, calculated at fifty percent. The Shanghai Post Office had heard of the overseas postage increase in advance, but has not received orders. The implementation date is expected to be from November 1st, and commemorative stamps for the 30th National Day will be reissued.

Striking Workers

from the city's glass industry, led by a small number of workers from the factory's glass department who joined the striking group, suddenly stormed into the China Electric Bulb Factory, demanding that the workers in the factory's glass department join the strike. Failing to achieve this, they first destroyed the factory's large iron bucket and then assaulted the workers who were working, causing temporary disorder.

It is reported that workers in the city's glass industry went on strike last month due to unsuccessful wage increase requests, and the strike has lasted for over a month. As both labor and management have taken extreme positions, the matter remains unresolved, and the entire glass industry in the city is currently suspended.

### Lanxin Opera House Song Recording; Lang Yuxiu's Concert Rehearsal Yesterday

— Gui

(Photo of Ms. Lang Yuxiu by Kang Zuyi)

"The birth of a musical genius is the glory of a nation, but the birth of a singing genius is a national miracle! It is important to know that regardless of writing, painting, drama, or music, as long as you have considerable talent, coupled with cultivation and effort, you can succeed; but for singing, in addition to talent, cultivation, and effort, you must also have a gifted voice." This is the comment of the literary scholar Shao Xunmei, which can be used as an introduction to Ms. Lang Yuxiu.

The main reason why Ms. Lang Yuxiu was able to advance towards a musical future was because of a good family environment. Her grandfather was a music connoisseur, a predecessor engaged in theatrical work. Her father, Mr. Lang Jingshan, is now famous at home and abroad for photography, but initially he was a painter and a lover of music. Yuxiu grew up in such an environment of family learning and a rich musical atmosphere.

She began learning piano at the age of seven or eight. Later, her education was almost entirely in the field of Western music. At that time, her singing voice was already outstanding, attracting attention from the music community. Mr. Maibeki, the conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra and a famous musician, greatly appreciated her and considered her one of China's few musical singing geniuses. He said that if she could be sent abroad for formal study for three or four years, it would not be difficult to occupy a significant position in the world music scene. Her father had a plan to send her abroad to study, and someone was asking the Boxer Indemnity Committee for assistance on her behalf. In the end, she went abroad at her own expense. Mr. Jingshan, in his deep love for his daughter, resolutely used all his strength to fulfill his daughter's wishes.

In 1937, Ms. Lang passed the entrance examination for the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. That year, she ranked at the top in music theory, sight-reading, and ear training exams. The next year, she received an award for public vocal performance. Ms. Lang is the first Chinese woman to receive such an honor in the European music scene. She was in Paris on summer vacation when the European War broke out. She repeatedly received letters and telegrams from her father urging her to return, but in order to complete her studies, she hesitated to leave until Brussels was bombed and school was suspended, then she reluctantly packed her bags and boarded a boat back to China amid the sound of anti-aircraft guns.

Three years of study in Europe, proper training, and high cultivation enabled her Western music skills to progress and achieve rapid success. Leaving Belgium at this time can be said to be returning home after completing her studies. However, she has the virtue of humility and always tells people that her studies are unfinished and that she still needs rigorous training and cultivation, and regards being forced to drop out as a great regret.

At 9:15 PM on the 17th of this month, Ms. Lang Yuxiu will hold a musical concert at the Lanxin Opera House, with her soprano solo as the main program. Yesterday (the 13th) at 5:00 PM, a rehearsal was held in advance, and reporters entered the venue amid great congestion to enjoy the entire program. Ms. Lang's solo program is as follows: 1. A solo "Motet" from the religious repertoire, a famous work by the 17th-century Mozart, still widely circulated in the Old Christian countries. 2. The third act of the famous opera "Rigoletto," adapted by the Italian opera composer Verdi from Hugo's famous work "King's Play." 3. The famous drama "Mignon" by Thomas, based on Goethe's early novel. Ms. Lang sang the section "I am the blonde Titania goddess." 4. The 19th-century composer Debussy's famous work "Chanson Triste," a symbolist poem with a short theme and repeated rhythm. 5. The famous song "Notre Amour" by Fauré, a contemporary of Debussy, is the most classically influenced, with a subtle trembling hidden in the plain and elegant melody. 6. The famous song "Air Vif" by Poulenc, one of the "Six of France" in the French music scene, has a novel and moving sound. And several dance pieces by the 18th-century musician F. Chopin. In addition to Ms. Lang's solo performance, there will be a violin solo by Mr. Xu, playing a work from Beethoven's first period, with extremely harmonious piano accompaniment. The sound of the piano is like sitting in a childhood cradle, worthy of being a work by a musical saint of his generation. There will also be a piano solo by Miss Li, displaying lightness and grace.

Ms. Lang Yuxiu's entire concert program is Western classical music of the orthodox school, which is distinctly different from general jazz and swing music, with clear distinctions. However, there are no Chinese songs in the program, which is regrettable. If Ms. Lang were to sing the song "Tian Lun," which she sang for the film "Tian Lun" a few years ago, its elegance and moving quality would be a feast for the ears of the audience. At the same time, it could also reconcile the tastes of those with a less profound appreciation for music.

### Chinese Education Film Association Holds Third Board Meeting: Minister of Education Instructs that Educational Film Production Should Focus on System

(Chongqing Dispatch) The Chinese Education Film Association held its seventh session's third board meeting on October 1st, chaired by Chen Lifu. He gave an impromptu speech, emphasizing that the topics chosen by various educational film production organizations seem to lack a systematic approach. In the future, each production organization should specialize in a specific area. For example, the Central Film Studio could focus on films related to "National Defense Science" and "Party Doctrine Propaganda." The China Film Studio could specialize in films on "Scientific National Defense" (modern military education and army building). The China Education Film Studio could specialize in "Patriotic Education" films (covering history and geography, starting with geography). Other educational film production organizations could specialize in "Scientific Education" films (natural science teaching materials). This way, each organization can coordinate and make a comprehensive contribution. The resolutions made included: (1) The seventh annual meeting is postponed to July next year and will be held jointly with the association's tenth-anniversary celebration. (2) The next board of directors and supervisors will be elected by mail. (3) Researchers will study joint film production by various organizations to produce films about Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan. (4) The Singapore branch will be reorganized into the Malaya branch. (5) Peng Baichuan will be appointed as the director of the general affairs group, and Wang Zhan will be appointed as the director-general.

### Children's Library Adds Circulation Stations, Establishes Procedures and Seeks Service from All Sectors

To facilitate children in remote areas to borrow books, the Shanghai Children's Library has established multiple circulation stations in various districts of the city. This is intended to circulate the library's good reading materials to children, cultivate their interest in reading, and increase their extracurricular knowledge. This is purely service-oriented and does not involve any fees. Any organization, association, institution, store, or individual in the city who is enthusiastic about education and willing to serve children can apply to establish a circulation station. The procedures for applying to establish a circulation station are as follows:

(1) Applicants can obtain an application form from the library at Lane 1040, Jing'an Temple Road (at the intersection of Dahua Road), fill it out, stamp it, and submit it to the library for review. After approval, the library will appoint the applicant as a volunteer station manager, responsible for the station's operations, without remuneration. (2) The number of books in the circulation station will be determined by the library at the initial setup. Thereafter, the library will send personnel to replace the books every ten days. (3) Each time books are replaced, the station manager or their representative should check the quantity, and the library staff should sign for the books when they are returned (the forms will be provided by the library). (4) The circulation station should only display books from the library and should not display other types of books to avoid confusion. (5) All forms required by the circulation station will be provided by the library, but they must not be used for other purposes or wasted arbitrarily, or damaged without reason. (6) Circulation stations with excellent performance will be awarded souvenirs by the library as a form of encouragement. (7) The responsibilities of the circulation station are as follows: 1. Obligatorily handle borrowing and returning procedures in accordance with the "Circulation Station Borrowing Rules" established by the library, without charging any fees. 2. Take good care of the books and avoid losing them. If lost, the cost must be compensated. 3. Allow children to read books freely. If children want to borrow books to take home, they must present the library's borrowing card. 4. When children borrow books, first leave the borrowing card, and at the same time, take out the card inside the borrowed book, fill in the borrowing card number and stamp the date, then connect the借閱 with夹在处, arrange the station according to the book code, and then the book will be allowed to be taken out by the child. 5. When children return books, first find the book card of the book according to the book code (because the book card is arranged according to the book code when borrowing), and find the borrowing card, then check the number of books returned according to the number of books listed on the book card. If there are no errors, insert the book card into the book and return the borrowing card to the child. 6. If children borrow books and fail to return them on time, their borrowing rights may be suspended. 7. Fill in the number of people borrowing and returning books on the form printed by the library every day and submit it to the library at the end of the month for audit. 8. Please serve the children within the prescribed time to maintain credibility. 9. Treat borrowing children with care, enthusiasm, and guidance. (8) If a circulation station is unable to comply with the above procedures, the library may be notified to revoke it. (9) If necessary, these procedures may be amended by the librarian and submitted to the board of directors for approval.

Circulation Station Borrowing Rules: 1. Children must have the library's borrowing card. 2. To borrow a book, the borrowing card must be submitted first and retrieved when the book is read. If the book is taken home, the card should be left at the circulation station and retrieved when the book is returned. 3. Each person can borrow only one book or one box at a time (based on the number of books listed on the book card). No further borrowing is allowed until the borrowed book is returned. 4. The borrowing period for each book is one week and cannot be renewed.

### Watching Speculators Self-Destruct

— Ping Ye

There was an American businessman who announced to the public on the first day, "She is coming!" On the second day, he said, "She has arrived!" On the third day, he said, "She is scheduled to perform!" On the fourth day, he rented a theater and announced, "She will be on stage tomorrow!" On the fifth day, everyone bought tickets to see her, but when the lights came on, there were only a few large words that read, "She has already left." This story is a blow to those who are curious.

A Shanghai money shop announced "fundraising" on the first day, "shareholders withdraw first" on the second day, opened on the third day, depositors were delighted, and the host left on the fourth day, and the deposits were transferred. This recent event is a blow to speculators.

In fact, in today's Shanghai society, there are so many hoarders, and bulls and bears are so busy. It has not come, and it may not even exist. It has already left before it comes. What is regrettable is that speculators anxiously expect the opportunity to come, the opportunity is scheduled to come, and the opportunity has actually left. But speculators still do not admit that the opportunity will leave, and even permanently expect the opportunity to come. As a result, speculators swallow up speculators, and speculators are still empty-handed.

Nothing can be permanently achieved by luck. The frenzy of speculation destroys the true meaning of life, disrupts social order, and buries the creativity of one's own career. The speculator who is excited today will be the discouraged loser tomorrow, merely stirring up social turmoil and plunging himself and his descendants into storms and even ruin.

He will be rich, he is indeed rich, he is already poor. Speculators can never escape this inevitable formula, but the lost sheep are still lost forever. They do not have time to grieve for themselves, but later generations grieve for them. Later generations grieve for them but do not learn from them, which also causes later generations to grieve for later generations. We do not believe that the last of the later generations can be found among today's speculators, so we think that grieving is useless, and we can only watch them self-destruct.

### Recording the Public Concession's Household Budget

— Zapan

At the beginning of October, we started recording the household budget for the Public Concession Statistics Office. On the first day, we first checked the items that we had pre-purchased and stored at home in order to check at the end of the month how much was used during the month. After that, we kept accounts every day, and every income and expenditure had to be recorded, and the quantities had to be recorded very precisely. Although we had to spend some time every day, we thought that the Public Concession would be able to determine a living index for employees, and that general wages could be used as a standard, then our efforts would be very worthwhile.

In addition to this main purpose, I feel that there are also many benefits for the family itself:

First: Now, because prices are soaring, almost every family pre-purchases and stores daily necessities. Some of these things are bought in small quantities, and there is no total amount. Now, take this opportunity to calculate how many daily necessities are actually stored at home.

Second: Most of the daily household expenses are small amounts. Because the amounts are small, there is inevitably some waste in some places, and this becomes a not-so-small expense month after month. Usually, we don't pay attention to this. Now, by carefully keeping accounts every day, it is easy to see where we can save money and which expenses are wasteful.

Third: Now the cost of living is rising day by day, and monthly expenses are increasing month after month. However, only the person in charge of household affairs is clear about this situation. The rest of the people often do not fully understand how much household expenses have increased. After keeping accounts, everyone is very clear about how much the family spends each day, so they can deeply feel the difficulty of life and automatically save money in all aspects and reduce waste.

Now, although the Public Concession no longer seeks household accounts, for the sake of the above-mentioned advantages, families who have not participated may wish to record them according to their format, and the result will definitely have more effects.

### University Personalities

— Qian Changnian

Preface: There are people and there are stories (1) So that's how it is

A certain female student changes into new clothes every day. When the price of rice becomes more expensive, the "outfits" become more energetic. The female students look at each other in dismay, and the male students also look at her with sidelong glances. Later, the truth came to light: this Miss's father turned out to be a rice shop owner.

(2) Fierce face, kind heart

Miss X of the Faculty of Arts is sure to put on a stern face whenever she sees a member of the opposite gender. In fact, the lady is kind and loving in her dealings with people. The reason for this is that a certain man once said that Miss X's face is most beautiful when she is angry. The lady accidentally overheard this, so she vowed not to treat people with a smiling face in order to enhance her beauty. This was revealed by Miss Q, a member of the lady's entourage. The accuracy remains to be verified.

### Biography of Characters in the Civet Cat for Crown Prince Case

— Liutang

(6) Bao Longtu

Bao Zheng asked about things and listened to lawsuits, and he was indeed able to do everything himself. As a rule, the Kaifeng Prefectural Governor, in order to maintain his dignity, the litigants were not allowed to go directly to the court. The clerks forwarded the cases to the Prefectural Governor. As a result, the clerks were able to commit malfeasance and kill the people, and I do not know how many. Bao Zheng, as the Prefectural Governor, ordered to open the front door so that the litigants could come forward to explain the truth. The clerks did not dare to deceive, so everyone admired virtue. This is why the name of Bao Qingtian is still respected by later generations.

However, Bao Longtu had nothing to do with the case between Empress Liu and Emperor Renzong. Bao Zheng took office after Emperor Renzong had personally taken charge of the government. Therefore, the novel's depiction of Emperor Renzong recognizing his mother with Bao Zheng's help is too far from the truth and has no impact. Bao Zheng once advised Emperor Renzong to establish a crown prince, which did happen, because Emperor Renzong had no son.

In the novel, Bao Zheng, although honest and upright, seems to have the characteristics of a cruel official. However, according to historical books, it is not so. History says, "Zheng was naturally upright, hated the harshness of officials, and strived to be kind. Although he hated evil very much, he never failed to promote loyalty and forgiveness." This shows that Bao Zheng deeply hated harshness, so he wanted to reverse it and strive to be kind and promote loyalty and forgiveness. The drama wants to portray his uprightness, but the exaggeration is excessive, and he is unconsciously cruel. Bao Zheng once used greed to warn his adopted grandson, saying: "If later generations of descendants become officials and commit misconduct, they shall not be allowed to return to their native homes, and they shall not be buried in the large forbidden areas. If they do not follow my will, they are not my sons or grandsons." Unexpectedly, what Bao Zheng hated most has become fashionable in later generations, and the reason why greed has become a trend is nothing more than the pursuit of extravagance. However, the simple home style of Bao Lao can be passed down for generations. How deeply things and desires deceive people, and how many people with lofty ideals and benevolence have been destroyed! Now, how can we have thousands of Bao Longtus, who are not afraid of power and authority, to clarify officialdom and create benefits for the people!

There is also an old eunuch, Chen Lin, in the novel. When searching through biographies, not only is there no Chen Lin among the eunuchs, but there is also no such thing as Chen Lin among the eunuchs. However, during Empress Liu's time, there was indeed a Cheng Lin, who once advised Empress Liu to emulate Empress Wu. However, he was not an eunuch, and he also served as the Kaifeng Prefectural Governor. He met when Empress Liu's relative, Wang Mengzheng's son Qi Xiong, beat an old soldier to death and also bribed his wife to report that he had died of illness. Lin observed that his expression was different and found the appearance of being beaten to death, and arrested Qi Xiong. Empress Liu told Lin: Qi Xiong did not kill him, but his slave beat him. Lin said: The slave has no right to act on his own, and ordering the slave to beat someone is the same as committing the crime himself, so Qi Xiong was punished according to the law. An Wu family, a relative of the emperor, left her husband and took her daughter away. Her husband sued her in the Kaifeng Prefecture. Lin asked the Wu family to return her daughter. Wu Yun said that she had been taken into the palace. Lin asked the emperor: I am afraid that people all over the world will secretly criticize Your Majesty for taking other people's wives and daughters. The emperor quickly ordered her to be released, flogged, and returned to her wife. He was then awarded the title of Academician of the Dragon Diagram Pavilion and again served as the Kaifeng Prefectural Governor. All of these events took place before Bao Zheng. Later generations may have confused Cheng Lin and Bao Zheng's knowledge of Kaifeng Prefecture into one, which is common for novelists and is not surprising.

Thirteen Wandering to Shanghai

But soon, countless tragic experiences were spread from the mouths of people who had escaped from various places, making those who heard them as afraid as if they had seen a demon, especially those who had young women at home were even more disheartened.

Old Manager Meng sighed repeatedly as he looked at his daughter-in-law, who looked like a fat pig.

"To avoid losing face, of course, we can only leave! He hesitated for a whole morning. "But I, the old man, am not leaving. How can we abandon the old store that has been passed down from father to son? Linsheng, you should take your wife and leave first. It doesn't matter where you go, as long as you don't let those young daughters-in-law suffer, I, the old man, will be worthy of our ancestors!"

Because they launched this, the loyal little Gouzi knew about it and rushed home to report it, and like a preaching pastor, he turned to Qiu Haitang and said:

"Now, before the big households in the village are all gone, Third Master, you might as well sell all the things at home that can be exchanged for money, put it together into a sum, and take the girl and run away quickly! These few houses and a few acres of land, even if they are handed over to me, little Gouzi, no matter if Western soldiers come or Eastern soldiers come, I will always guard it for you! As long as I, little Gouzi, don't die, you, old man, will come back in three to five years, and I guarantee you won't be missing a single blade of grass! Because you..."

Before Xiao Gouzi could finish his words, Qiu Haitang had already repeatedly patted his right foot and sighed helplessly. (236)

### Ding Xilin's New Work

— Zheng Xiao

Before Cao Yu, there were only two playwrights who enjoyed the greatest fame in Chinese drama: one was Tian Han, and the other was Ding Xilin, the head of the Physics Department at Peking University. Ding's works are just a few one-act plays, such as "After Drinking," "Oppression," "A Wasp," and "The Air of Beijing," etc. However, because of the witty and ingenious dialogue, they attracted many readers. When they were put on the stage, they also attracted many viewers. Although what he wrote is comedy, it is not stiff and gimmicky, or lowly to make people laugh, but as an artist, he gives people some meaningful olives, which makes people still have an aftertaste after chewing them.

Recently, I watched Ding's full-length comedy "Miaofeng Mountain" at the Lafaye Theater, which he had put down for ten years. The play vaguely implied that his comedy owed much to the British people's innate humor. I have dabbled too little in British dramas such as Shaw's works, so I cannot and dare not make any appropriate comments. However, after watching this play, I felt that it was even more interesting than watching his one-act plays. The dozen or so drama critics in front of me and on my left and right also unanimously praised it. Judging from their joyful expressions, I knew that they all unanimously praised it. For example, the wonderful metaphor of calling shackles "wife"; Wang Laohu's retelling of Hua Hua's words, which the security captain did not understand at all, but the audience understood; in particular, the portrayal of the bookworm Guo Shihong and his wife Shi Zhishi (lion) was the most subtle. A lady sitting behind me sighed, "This lady is too fierce!" The scene of leaving with a "thermos" and "candle" and arguing about not eating out of spite was all wonderful to the point of perfection. M jokingly said to T, "This is about you and your wife!"

Let me give another detailed example. Women like to hide their age the most, and they often don't tell people their real age. Ding added a little satire. Wang Laohu wrote a certificate for Shi Zhi and asked her, "How old are you this year?" She said, "Twenty-five years old." Wang Laohu raised his head, looked at Shi Zhi, nodded, and smiled, "When you check later, don't forget and don't say the wrong thing." He didn't explicitly say that Shi Zhi was lying, but he implied it. Ding's humor is not all-encompassing, but always leaves three points, mostly like this.

If it is just humor and the content is empty, the laughter will be over after a while. In fact, the theme is "eliminate violence and bring peace to the people." After you have seen it, you may think of a modern hero who has been supported by many students.

### The Latest Grand Theater on the Sea - A General Overview of the Majestic Grand Theater's Construction

— Huang

The Majestic Grand Theater, Shanghai's largest cinema palace, three years in the making and costing four million, has been fully completed. Magnificent and splendid, sturdy and beautiful, it is a fusion of modern and classical architectural beauty, and also the newest type of cinema palace in the Far East. Here is a brief description of its construction:

New Type of Architecture

The renowned architect Fan Wenzhao has always had a deep understanding of theater projects. Famous cinemas in Shanghai, such as the Nanjing and Heguang, were all designed by him. Now, the Majestic is also the work of Mr. Fan, meticulously structured and carefully designed, and it is his most satisfying work in his life. The architecture of the Majestic Theater is three-dimensional, and all steel-concrete and fireproof materials are used, making it exceptionally strong. The entrance is a circular giant tower, towering at the corner of Gordon Road and Bubbling Well Road, both solemn and magnificent. The lobby is also circular, with two stone staircases inside, one leading to the main hall and the other to the escalator hall. At the end of the escalator hall is a semi-circular artificial marble escalator, which leads directly to the upper hall. Exquisite murals are embedded on the walls of the escalator platform, allowing the audience to appreciate them while spiraling upwards. The upper hall is paved with artificial marble, the floor is smooth and lustrous, spotless, and the hall pillars are purple-red, surrounded by carved railings, making it feel even more opulent.

Special Equipment

In the center of the main hall's flat ceiling is embedded a wide and continuous pattern, which guides the audience's sight lines, focusing them on the screen. As for the electric lights hidden in the flat ceiling, they also emit blue light during screenings, so that the entire theater still maintains some light, a great improvement compared to the old-fashioned side lights. In addition, the harmony of the colors throughout the theater and the air conditioning equipment are also excellent.

The main hall of the theater can accommodate 1,120 spectators, and the balcony 513 people, for a total of more than 1,600 people. The distance between each seat is very wide, making people feel very comfortable when seated.

Brief News: Since the Yucai Theater Society performed "The Emancipation of Women," it has been striving to strengthen its organization. It is now rehearsing Lin Ke's play "Submerged." It is said that the ticket revenue, after expenses, will be entirely donated to charity organizations. The performance is scheduled for the 17th at the Russian Art Theater.

### Chatting about Opera with Master Shouchun

— Su Shaoqing

The Story of Cheng Yanqiu's Rise to Fame (Part 2)

Yanqiu's weight has almost increased with his reputation. Last year, he told me that he weighed 186 pounds. This time, I met him in a hurry and didn't have time to ask if his weight had increased or decreased, but from the way he looked as Li Guizhi in "Selling the Horse," even Yang Guifei of the Tang Dynasty could not claim to be unique in her beauty. I am afraid that his weight, even if reduced, is only by grams. Fortunately, his movements are still agile, unlike the general sluggishness, probably because he has practiced boxing, although he is fat. He used to practice boxing with Du Xingwu, a famous master of internal boxing, for a long time, but he stopped later due to circumstances. His fatness is not due to practicing boxing, but to abandoning it halfway. When boxing, the muscles and bones are stretched, and the blood vessels are circulated, so the appetite is good and the amount of food is strong. Once stopped, he can't help but eat greasy things and sleep a lot after eating. Why wouldn't he be fat? Some people advise him to be a vegetarian and practice internal martial arts, so that the fat can be gradually reduced. I don't know if he can do it? Although the facts are clear, Yanqiu's fatness does not hinder his singing or affect his reputation, so even if he is over 200 pounds, what does it matter! If you look at animals, those in the mountains and fields are mostly thin, and those in the home gardens are mostly fat, you can think about it, and there is no need to worry about it.

The other day, I watched him sing "Selling the Horse" and play Li Guizhi. My seat was very close to the stage, and I saw a strange and beautiful thing, that is, Yanqiu had peach-colored nail polish on his fingernails, just like the "Kou Dan" on the slender fingers of modern women. It felt very beautiful to find this on Yanqiu's hands. I wonder what other people saw? Because of this one thing, I will advise Yanqiu to restore his old name, Yanqiu, haha!

### Qiong Hua in a Rain of Blood

— Gu Lidao

Chapter 18: Vowing to Sweep Away the Huns, Regardless of My Own Life

Li Zicheng said, "Since the military advisor also has this intention, I must kill Wu Sangui to vent my anger. Can we start the army tomorrow? I also ask the military advisor to accompany me." Niu Jinxing said, "I should follow the king's left and right, and do my best to repay you. Since the king's army has set out, it has been victorious everywhere. Now that we have taken the capital, the world is shaking. Zhou Yuji of Ningwu Pass, who is intelligent and resourceful, still died at the hands of the king. Why worry that Wu Sangui cannot be defeated?" Li Zicheng felt a little comforted after hearing this. After Niu Jinxing left, he immediately summoned Wu Xiang. At this moment, Wu Xiang had received a reply from Sangui, knowing that his son had suddenly changed his mind and was unwilling to surrender. He knew he was going to suffer. When he saw Li Zicheng, he trembled and knelt on the ground. Li Zicheng pointed at him and scolded, "You thief, how dare you deceive me! You said your son was willing to surrender? Now your son is openly mourning for the Ming emperor and issuing a proclamation, denouncing me as a clown, a pig, and a rebel, insulting me to the extreme. How do you know that I rose up to relieve the people from their suffering and stabilize the world because the common people are suffering so deeply? You old thief must be colluding with your son and pretending to surrender to me. If I keep you, I will definitely suffer from you in the future. Your son scolds me, so I will kill you, the old thief, first to vent the anger in my chest. Let's see what your son can do to me!" After saying that, he ordered his men to push Wu Xiang out and behead him. At this moment, Wu Xiang was so frightened that his face lost all color. He trembled incessantly, kowtowing like pounding garlic, and begged Li Zicheng for mercy, saying, "Your Majesty, please see clearly. This humble servant abandoned the rebel and surrendered, wholeheartedly following Your Majesty in order to gain fame and fortune. Therefore, I listened to Your Majesty's instructions and wrote a letter to recruit my dog son to surrender. My dog son had already agreed to lead his troops to come, but I don't know why he suddenly changed his mind later. This is not my fault." (192)
