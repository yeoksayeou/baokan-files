Large Numbers of Chinese Troops Gather in Eastern Zhejiang to Counterattack Ningbo and Zhenhai

Chongqing: Official communiqués recently stated that the Sino-Japanese war along the eastern coast of China, from northeastern Zhejiang Province to parts of eastern Fujian Province, was in a state of high tension yesterday. Official communiqués have now for the first time admitted that the Japanese forces, after occupying Shaoxing, have also occupied Ningbo and Zhenhai. (Japanese forces in Shanghai have already declared that Fuzhou was occupied yesterday afternoon.) The communiqué continued that Zhuji, southwest of Shaoxing along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, has also been captured by Japanese troops advancing from Shaoxing and Xiaoshan. The battles for Wenzhou and Fuzhou are still ongoing. The communiqué also stated that fierce street fighting occurred at noon on Sunday when Japanese forces occupied Ningbo. Japanese troops departing from Zhenhai, along with over four thousand Japanese reinforcements landing midway in Ningbo, launched a fierce attack on Ningbo, but Chinese forces continued to resist strongly. It also stated that Chinese forces recaptured Zhenhai again at 2:00 PM on Sunday afternoon, but it soon fell again. Japanese naval landing forces have pressed towards Wenzhou along the north and south banks of the river, but as of yesterday, it was still reported that the city remained in Chinese hands. Japanese forces landing on both the north and south banks of the Min River in eastern Fujian Province on Saturday morning captured Lianjiang and Changle on the same day. Chinese observers here predict that the Japanese naval landing forces will withdraw soon. They point out that the Japanese naval authorities may follow the example of other places, and withdraw their troops after occupying port cities. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)

Relief Committee Allocates Funds for Emergency Relief in Zhejiang and Fujian

Sino-Soviet Agreement Reached; Japan Seeks to End the War

Chongqing: The suspension of freight and passenger transport on the Siberian Railway has attracted great interest here. It is generally believed that if Japan has not withdrawn its defensive troops from the Manchurian border, then the Soviet Union's eastern frontier defense troops would certainly not withdraw westward. Roughly, the Soviet Union can withdraw 200,000 troops during this half-month period. Therefore, the number of troops Japan can transfer to China, or is in the process of transferring, can be estimated. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty, the general public originally believed that Japan might first try to resolve the "China Incident." This view seems to have been proven by facts, and looking at the recent battles in the Dahong Mountains of Hubei Province and eastern Zhejiang, one can further discern Japan's intentions.

Editorial

### The Balkan Campaign is Drawing to a Close

The gambling adventures of Germany and Italy in the current Balkan War are nearing the stage of success. The various newspaper commentaries transmitted by British wire services in recent days have largely concluded that the British Expeditionary Force will inevitably withdraw from the Balkans. As the Times said in its editorial: "It must not be forgotten that when the British troops first landed in Greece, it did not form a coalition strong enough to counter the German offensive." The implication here is that the main reason for the failure of this Balkan War is mainly due to Turkey's refusal to cooperate. The Daily Mail pointed out more clearly: "When the Allied Alliance of the three countries in Southern Europe was in despair, it was very willing, we only had failure written all over us." Of course, the fact that the Soviet Union and Turkey did not actively intervene was the biggest reason for the failure of the British, Greek and Southern European countries in this Balkan war; but on the other hand, the reason why the Soviet Union and Turkey have not taken active steps so far must also be attributed to the speed of Germany and Italy's military achievements, that is, the grand effect of the "blitzkrieg".

Reviewing the battle situation for more than two weeks, the British, Greek and Southern European countries have almost always tried to block the advance first, and finally retreated, without any active use; so that the German and Italian aggressor forces have always maintained the offensive and realized their ambitions. This is the biggest reason for the military failure of the British, Greek and Southern European Allied Forces. British Prime Minister Churchill clearly admitted in a speech last week that in the current stage, Britain's assistance to the South and Greece cannot but be limited by many other strategic considerations; all Britain dares to say at present is to reiterate its determination to fight to the end with its allies. In other words, Britain did not concentrate all its forces on the Balkan land to prepare for a decisive battle with Germany and Italy; therefore, the future of the Allied Forces' brave resistance is, of course, bleak. What's more, the internal unrest in the South and Greece accelerated the process of defeat. Moreover, when the German and Italian armies cut off the connection between Greece and Southern Europe, and the connection between Southern Europe, and at the same time divided the South and Greece into sections, the resistance force of Yugoslavia inevitably decreased sharply, and added to the internal wavering, and declared collapse first. As for the reason why Greece is still able to support the situation, it is willing to rely on British assistance; assuming that the British military implements a retreat, then Greece's glorious record this time will have to end here: thereafter, what will cover the entire Balkans is darkness and violence.

When the Balkan Peninsula is submerged in dark clouds, wailing and storms, the anti-aggression war centered on Britain will be moved to the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Near East, Africa, the British Isles, and the Atlantic Ocean, and other possible stages. Assuming the timing and considering previous examples, the success of Germany and Italy's outward expansion in every fragment of space will be accompanied by a stagnation in every fragment of time. After this Balkan campaign, when and where the next scene will be unveiled is difficult to judge at present. However, in recent days, the main object on which Germany and Italy have chosen to exert pressure in the next scene seems to have some clues that can be explored. Assuming that the exploration is not bad, then Turkey, Spain, and the Vichy government of France will unfortunately be selected in turn. Indeed, the attitude of all these countries, whether they are accommodating or resisting, has a very important relationship with Germany and Italy's future strategy.

First, let's talk about Turkey. Apart from the Soviet Union, Germany and Italy have now controlled the entire European continent, and the only piece of clean land left is the European part of Turkey. What is important is that Turkey's geographical location is extremely important in all future developments. The best shortcut for Germany and Italy to strike at the British Empire is through Turkey; even if not, they must first arrange their relationship with Turkey properly if they bypass Turkey from the African side to reach the Near East or India. At the same time, the attitude of the countries in the Near East is also greatly affected by Turkey's position: and the future destiny of French Syria may depend on Turkey's actions.

In addition to Turkey, another way for Germany and Italy to invade Africa is through Spain and capture Gibraltar. Here, Germany and Italy can obtain the narrowest water surface on the Mediterranean Sea and cross over to Africa; and it can also give a fatal threat to the Mediterranean Sea, the lifeline of the British Empire. In the European War for more than a year, Germany and Italy have never stopped coercing and enticing Spain; and no matter whether their negotiations with Turkey can succeed in the future, their activities towards Spain will definitely become countless times more intense.

In addition to Turkey and Spain, Germany and Italy will inevitably intensify their pressure on the Vichy government of France. What they are coveting under what pretext, of course, is the French naval fleet.

In summary, although Germany and Italy's army and air force have achieved remarkable results, their navy is very clearly at a disadvantage against the British navy; therefore, if they want to further strike at the British Empire, they must find a land passage, or use all methods to increase their own naval strength. This is also the reason why Japan in the Far East was able to act before Germany and Italy.

### Tensions Rise in the Far East; US Sends Troops to the Philippines; Manila Becomes a Strong Far Eastern Fortress; US to Intensify Aid to China to Check Japan

Manila: The US transport ship "Republic" docked in Manila Bay today, and 17 US officers and 2,058 soldiers from Fort Mason, California, disembarked. This troop contingent is the largest US detachment to arrive in the Orient for the first time. Most of these soldiers will be stationed on Corregidor, the largest fortress at the mouth of Manila Bay and the strongest US defense east of Hawaii. The arrival of these troops has led the general public to pay close attention to the fact that the US is now engaged in military construction in the Philippines at a rate many times greater than that undertaken in the forty years since the Philippines was acquired from Spain. Furthermore, seven US Navy construction engineers arrived here yesterday from the United States aboard a Clipper, indicating that the United States is intensifying its establishment of defenses in the Philippines. All construction for the US Army garrison is proceeding busily, as barracks, storage facilities, factories, and aircraft hangars must be completed before the monsoon season in mid-June. The Philippine Daily News, commenting on the arrival of these troops, stated that history never repeats itself. Forty years ago, US troops came here to conquer, and subsequently brought Filipinos the great friendship of rulers and ruled. The people of the Philippines no longer resent the US troops arriving here today. It is reported that the ship "Washington" will bring 2,200 US troops here in early May. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

Manila: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka returned to Tokyo today, and attention is also focused on Japan. Observers are watching for signs of a revival of Japan's southward expansion policy. Responsible parties in Manila, Batavia, and Singapore feel that if Japan seizes the opportunity presented by the Axis powers' offensive in Europe to adjust its policies or expand its "New Order in East Asia," incidents will occur in the Far East no later than June. This feeling is widespread, so although the US government has not yet advised civilians to evacuate the Philippines, there has been a gradual increase in women and children leaving the Philippines to return to the United States. The Army and Navy have ordered the families of officers and soldiers on active duty to return home. The prevailing consensus here is that if Britain shows significant signs of collapse, causing the United States to shift its attention from the East, Japan will seize the opportunity to demand substantial concessions from the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, or even Australia. Military circles point out that Japan's reward for mediating the Thai-Vietnamese conflict may be the right to transit through Thailand to deploy troops to attack British Malaya. Britain's recent increase in troops in Malaya clearly reflects the possibility of this eventuality. Although officials have remained silent after the recent talks between British, American, and Dutch officials here, the signs of close cooperation between the Eastern garrisons of the three countries are very evident. Last week, Singapore received a shipment of naval repair supplies, which were clearly not intended for British ships. British naval bombers are now flying across the Pacific to Cavite, where they are received by British personnel and flown to Singapore. While the British personnel are waiting here, they are entertained by the US Navy at Cavite. The US Army recently sent military observers to the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Thailand for the first time. The Asiatic Fleet has postponed its summer visit to China, or at least until mid-July, and the northern cruise may be abandoned altogether, indicating the importance of the US Navy's patrols in Philippine territorial waters. The Asiatic Fleet is currently conducting large-scale exercises in the southern Philippine territorial waters. Today, the transport ship "Republic" brought 2,075 army personnel here, the largest group in any shipment of troops to date. Another 2,000 people will arrive in Manila aboard the "Washington." Two teams of carpenters from each US Army station are working in shifts to build new barracks to accommodate this new group of troops. The Chongqing Chinese government's plan to continue resisting Japan is largely based on the expectation of increased supplies from the United States. Although reliable statistics on the US supplies already shipped to Rangoon are not available, the best-informed sources believe there is a sufficient quantity to encourage China to continue its resistance. On the other hand, some believe that these supplies are too few to significantly impact the final outcome of the war. If the Chongqing government wants to have any hope of winning against a Japanese offensive, it needs not only an increased supply of new weapons and supplies, but also time and technical assistance to train Chinese troops to use these weapons. In the current situation, observers believe that China can at best maintain the status quo without collapsing, preventing a large number of Japanese troops stationed in China from being diverted elsewhere. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington: Yesterday, unofficial sources here stated that the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands may have reached an informal understanding regarding actions to be taken if Japan moves south. However, it is said that there is no written agreement. Secretary of State Hull told reporters that he had no knowledge of a written agreement between Britain, the United States, and Eastern countries, as reported in Japanese newspapers. Japanese sources stated that Britain, India, Australia, China, the Dutch East Indies, and the United States have established a defense agreement, but the report did not mention the contents of the agreement. Some time ago, Britain proposed allowing US warships unrestricted use of Singapore in wartime or peacetime. Well-informed sources here say that this proposal will undoubtedly be part of any Far Eastern defense agreement. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### Canadian Prime Minister Completes Mission, Returns to Ottawa; US Supplies Canada with Military Equipment Under Lend-Lease; Canada and the US Jointly Defend Greenland

Ottawa: Prime Minister King recently declared that if Greenland and Iceland are invaded, Canada will dispatch troops to defend them in conjunction with relevant countries. We were fully aware in advance of the US government's establishment of air and naval bases in Greenland. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King has returned here from the United States. While in the US, he reached an agreement with the United States on the joint development of Canadian resources, so this trip was definitely not just a vacation. Officials expect that the agreement reached will be of great benefit to both parties, and the wartime Canadian exchange rate problem has been resolved as a result. According to general interpretations here, the United States will use more Canadian raw materials and supply Canada with military supplies and ammunition under the Lend-Lease Act for shipment to Britain. In this way, Canada will not have to worry about a shortage of US dollars. In the past twelve months, Canada's trade deficit with the US is estimated by non-official sources to be worth approximately $125,000,000. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Washington: After the US government signed an agreement with the Canadian federation yesterday, political figures here stated that this agreement is essentially the US providing material assistance to the Canadian federation in accordance with the "Aid to Democratic Nations Act." The US government will continue to purchase copper, nickel, radium, zinc, aluminum, and various chemical supplies from the Canadian federation, and in return, Canada will purchase armaments from the US without having to pay cash. The details specified in this agreement are extremely detailed and were drafted by experts. It is also psychologically important and will further strengthen the ties between the US and the Canadian federation. For example, the New York Sun reported, "The establishment of this agreement, from the US perspective, is tantamount to mobilizing national resources to strengthen national defense, and from Canada's perspective, it can be seen as mobilizing national resources to engage in warfare." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Montreal: Canadian Naval Chief MacDonald said in a speech that Canada will soon build warships for the United States, and that Canada must use 45% of its gross national income for war expenses. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington: It is expected that President Roosevelt will send a special message to Congress in a few days, urging the rapid passage of the St. Lawrence Seaway and power project to strengthen US-Canadian national defense. (International News Service dispatch, 22nd)

Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King said yesterday, "The declaration in Hyde Park is North America's response to Adolf Hitler's birthday celebration." It is also reported that President and Mrs. Roosevelt have agreed to visit Ottawa in early May. King also mentioned the statement he and President Roosevelt issued on Sunday evening, saying that the US and Canada will exchange military supplies and will jointly accelerate the defense of the Western Hemisphere and aid to Britain. King said that this agreement is "mobilizing the resources of the Americas to defeat Hitler." (International dispatch, 22nd)

### Rumors of Yarnell's Appointment as Philippine Commissioner

Manila: News from high administrative circles has been continuously circulating here today, stating that if the current US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, is transferred to another position here, his successor will be Vice Admiral Yarnell. However, this news does not indicate that the White House has made a decision, only that the White House has expressed interest in Yarnell, the former commander of the Asiatic Fleet. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

### Japanese Cabinet Holds Special Meeting to Hear Matsuoka's Report; Review of Foreign Policy to be Conducted

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will arrive in Tokyo today to report on his negotiations with Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union, so that the government can review Japan's entire foreign policy. Japanese sources say that the Japan-Soviet treaty and the strengthening of the Tripartite Pact will help Japan's position in the Far East. All parties are concerned about future relations with Britain and the United States. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo: The Cabinet is scheduled to hold a special meeting tomorrow to hear Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's report on his trip to Europe and the Soviet-Japanese treaty. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived at Tachikawa Military Airport this afternoon, where he was greeted by many high-ranking government officials. After disembarking, Matsuoka immediately traveled by car to the Prime Minister's official residence. After reporting to the Prime Minister and other cabinet members, Matsuoka hosted Japanese newspaper reporters, and then met with foreign reporters before entering the Imperial Palace to meet the Emperor. One foreign correspondent asked about the reported withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Far East after the conclusion of the Japanese-Soviet neutrality pact. Matsuoka replied that this matter should be asked of Molotov or Stalin. According to the Japanese disclosure of the conversation, Matsuoka answered that everything was public and there were no conditions to speak of in response to a question about whether there were any conditions attached to the signing of the Japanese-Soviet neutrality pact. Both sides understand that the conclusion of this agreement will allow for the rapid resolution of various outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union. We must act quickly to deal with the current major needs. We should not confuse prudence with procrastination. The Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact and declaration do not affect the Tripartite Pact, just as the Tripartite Pact does not affect the relations of the three countries with the Soviet Union. Matsuoka also said that he did not intend to say anything more before reporting to the Emperor. When asked if he was prepared to conclude a non-aggression pact with the United States, Matsuoka shrugged without answering. When asked if he planned to take any diplomatic action towards the United States, he replied that it would be unwise to publish any plans before they matured. Matsuoka only spent five minutes meeting with foreign reporters and essentially refused to answer each question clearly. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo: Today, a spokesman for the Information Bureau said that they had only heard news reports regarding the rumored military agreement concluded by China, Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies, and had not received any official confirmation. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### Sino-American Stabilization Fund Negotiations Concluded; Agreement to be Signed Soon

Chongqing: President Roosevelt's eldest son, James Roosevelt, is expected to arrive here in a few days. According to Chongqing sources, Roosevelt left Honolulu on Sunday to come to the provisional capital. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

### Minor Issues Between the US and the Soviet Union Partially Resolved

Washington: Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that the scope of the neutrality treaty concluded by the Soviet Union and Japan is not as broad as generally imagined. As for the talks between the State Department and Soviet Ambassador Oumansky, they only involved various minor issues, some of which have been resolved. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### US Ship Bound for Greece Destroyed En Route; State Department Now Studying US Navy Escort Plan

Washington: According to reports last night, a US ship carrying $125,000 worth of Red Cross relief supplies intended for Greece has been destroyed. The first US ship carrying $2,000,000 is missing. This is the first time since the beginning of the war that Red Cross relief supplies have been lost due to the war. Red Cross officials said, "Three weeks ago, the Greek cargo ship Grigore, carrying medicine, blankets, clothing, and food, intended to unload in Greece, disappeared somewhere in the South Atlantic." They also said that they do not know if the ship was sunk by a mine or a torpedo. Also, another Greek cargo ship, the Rulukis, carrying $2,000,000 worth of Red Cross food, disappeared on its way to Greece four weeks ago. (International News Service dispatch, 22nd)

Washington: The State Department began to actively consider the issue of US Navy escorts for US ships yesterday. This is the first time that any part of the government other than the Navy Department has given serious consideration to this controversial issue. State Department experts have decided that it is perfectly legal for US Navy ships to escort US ships carrying supplies to Britain if they do not enter the war zone. However, it has also been considered that if they are carrying contraband, German warships still have the right to intercept, search, and temporarily detain such ships. The weakness of Germany's lack of warships to patrol the high seas is something that can be exploited. (International News Service dispatch, 22nd)

### Britain Massively Collecting US Securities

London: The British Treasury has now requisitioned another 164 types of US securities, with payment due on June 2. Since March 1940, the British Treasury has now requisitioned a total of 561 types of US securities. The most recent requisition includes 69 types of common stock, 56 types of preferred stock, and 39 types of bonds. The requisition includes not only well-known stocks, but also some bankrupt stocks, which shows the extent to which the British Treasury is collecting dollar securities. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Darlan Visits Paris Again; Seeks Resolution of Franco-German Issues; Rumors of Germany Offering Prisoner Release in Exchange for Closer Franco-German Cooperation

Vichy: Vice Premier Darlan plans to make another trip to Paris within days to conduct important talks with German authorities. Recalling that after Vice Premier Darlan's last trip to Paris, German Ambassador to France Abetz promptly returned to Berlin to consult with the German government in order to continue discussions with Vice Premier Darlan on various outstanding issues between France and Germany. After the departure of the previous Vice Premier Laval, the newspapers in occupied France listed various issues and demanded that measures be taken immediately to resolve them. The most important of these were: (1) Readjusting the borders between occupied and free France, (2) Reducing France's burden of supplying provisions to the German garrison in occupied France, (3) Releasing French prisoners of war who are farmers first. Subsequently, due to Germany's focus on the Balkans, there was no time for further discussion of the above issues. But at this point, the international situation has entered a new stage, and it is hoped that the outstanding issues between France and Germany can be resolved in the shortest possible time. In addition, Vice Premier Darlan recently accompanied Marshal Pétain on an inspection tour of the Pyrenees region in the southwest, and the people along the way expressed their complete trust, deeply moving the Marshal himself. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Vichy: It was learned here this morning that Hitler had sent a private letter to French Marshal Pétain, proposing "closer cooperation" as a prelude to lasting peace. At the same time, rumors spread that pro-German politician Laval may soon re-enter a partially reorganized cabinet. (Berlin sources said, "Although Laval's re-entry into the Vichy cabinet is undoubtedly necessary, it is not yet time to make various speculations about this possibility.") It is noteworthy that these rumors arose two days after an emergency cabinet meeting was convened in Madrid, where it was said that Spain's role in this war would be more clearly defined and that the status of Gibraltar would be affected. It is rumored that Hitler suggested to France the release and return of 500,000 French prisoners as part of a Franco-German close cooperation plan, and that these French prisoners are mostly farmers. (International News Service dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin: Reports that Hitler recently sent a telegram to French Marshal Pétain have been denied by the Foreign Ministry, which stated that the liaison between the French and German governments is the responsibility of French Vice Premier, Foreign Minister, Interior Minister, and Navy Minister Darlan, and German Ambassador to France Abetz, and that the talks between the two sides are proceeding smoothly. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

London: According to news from the French border, Vichy is discussing the possibility of reshuffling the Pétain cabinet. German gains in North Africa and the Balkans appear to have strengthened the position of those who advocate closer cooperation with Germany, but Laval may not be recalled to the cabinet, as Laval is still not trusted by the public. It is possible that Laval will be appointed ambassador to Paris to replace Brinon. If so, Laval will expedite the cooperation of the French delegation with the Armistice Commission, which will move from Wiesbaden to Paris. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### British Envoy Craigie Visits Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Discusses Routine Matters

Tokyo: British Ambassador to Japan Craigie has repeatedly met with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ohashi recently. When the Information Bureau spokesman met with reporters today, someone asked about this matter. It was answered that routine matters such as shipping issues were being discussed. An American reporter asked whether Japan would take similar action in East Asia to deal with the United States, as the United States is now encouraging Latin American countries to curb exports to Japan. The spokesman replied that if necessary, Japan would be forced to do so. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### German Prisoners Attempt Escape; All Captured

Camp Iroquois, Canada: According to unconfirmed reports received here, all 28 German prisoners who escaped recently have been apprehended. According to previous official reports, only six escaped. When soldiers searched an empty house, five German prisoners hiding inside rushed out to resist. The soldiers opened fire, killing two German prisoners and seriously injuring two others.

### Balkans Under Nazi Control; New Developments in European War; World's Eyes on Germany's Future Moves; German Pressure on Spain to Join Axis

Military observers in Vichy recently stated that the Greek war is coming to an end. The main issue now is to pay attention to what actions the Axis powers will take after occupying the entire Balkan Peninsula (excluding Turkey). In general, in the future, the European Mediterranean, the Adriatic Sea, and the Aegean Sea coastal areas will be under the control of Germany and Italy. The only exception is the European part of Turkey. In short, the Greek and North African wars are a stage in the current European war. It is expected that in the near future, the entire situation will undergo major developments. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Stockholm, Sweden: According to London sources here, British political figures are now quite concerned about the situation in the western Mediterranean. The Spanish cabinet's continuous meetings for two days have made London political circles feel very apprehensive. Although it is not yet possible to know what the Spanish government's decision will be, British political circles are deeply worried that the situation in the western Mediterranean will cause complex changes. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

London: It is widely rumored that Germany is heavily pressuring Spain to join the Axis powers in order to capture Gibraltar, or at least to close the Strait of Gibraltar. Germany has already placed artillery within Spanish territory on both sides of Gibraltar. If it can be used, it is tantamount to the area being in German hands. It is not yet known whether Germany will transport a large number of troops into famine-stricken Spain, causing transportation and food difficulties. However, a more practical approach seems to be to use artillery units only around Gibraltar. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

### Under Nazi Air Raids, British and Greek Allied Forces Continue to Retreat South, Establishing a New Line of Defense South of Lamia; German Troops Less Than 100 Miles from Athens

London - According to the latest news received by the British military headquarters in Cairo, the British forces in Greece are continuing a systematic retreat and have now withdrawn from Larissa and Trikala. However, the German forces have not broken through the Allied line of defense at any point. The current battle situation remains serious and is not expected to ease within a day or two. The German forces have advanced into Greece at a significant cost. The British military headquarters announced yesterday that British troops were ordered to retreat to a new position and are continuing to retreat under constant bombardment. This retreat is nearing completion. The enemy's advance is very cautious, due to the poor road conditions and the fact that they are met with heavy resistance every time they engage with British troops. British casualties are light. (Reuters, 22nd)

London - It has been officially announced that the British Imperial forces in Greece have established a defensive position south of Lamia, 50 miles south of Larissa. Military officials stressed that the German forces have suffered extremely heavy losses in recent operations in Greece. The retreat of the British and Greek forces to the new position is due to the German forces defeating the South Slav forces and breaking through the Monastir Gap, threatening the rear of the British and Greek forces. (Reuters, 22nd)

Turkish Capital - After news of the Greek situation reached here, people from all walks of life, although considering the situation in the Balkan Peninsula to be very serious, believe that even if the German forces exert pressure, the British and Greek Allied forces will still put up effective resistance without a doubt. It is said that the British and Greek military authorities have already prepared to withdraw the Allied forces to semi-Egypt in case of emergency. (Havas, 21st)

London - Foreign observers now increasingly believe that the British army must evacuate Greece, but it is extremely difficult to say whether they can avoid heavy personnel and material losses. Berlin claims that the British army has begun to withdraw and that five British troop carriers have been sunk by aircraft. Commentators say that the British aid to Greece was an extremely difficult move that could not be avoided on moral grounds. All observers unanimously acknowledge that although the British army fights bravely, it is outnumbered, and its military strategy is far inferior to that of Germany. The precision and sharpness of German machinery are undoubtedly superior. (United Press, 22nd)

### Berlin War Report Announces the Capture of Lamia

Berlin - German troops operating in Greece yesterday captured the port of Volos in Thessaly and the city of Lamia, an important town in southern Thessaly, guarding the strategic Thermopylae pass. The fall of the city is particularly unfavorable for the Greek army. (Haiyong, 22nd)

Berlin - The German High Command recently stated that the spearhead of the German motorized unit has penetrated to within only ninety miles of Athens and is poised to encircle the entire left wing of the Greek forces at Piraeus. This information was revealed in the German High Command's announcement of the capture of Lamia and Ioannina by German forces. Lamia was captured by the German motorized unit, which, in the middle of the week, had caused a six-mile-wide gap in the New Zealand forces' defensive position between the Aegean Sea and Mount Olympus, and had pushed through the Thessalian Plain from Larissa, approaching the third major British and Greek line of defense. These German troops are now only a few miles away from the historically significant Thermopylae Pass, where the Greeks defeated the Persian army in 480 BC. In addition to the rapid advance in southern Greece, its mechanized units, after fierce fighting, have reached the important seaport of Volos. Even though the highway bridges in the Lamia area were destroyed, the German motorized unit has deeply penetrated Lamia. German troops crossing the Pindus Mountains to the west have occupied Ioannina and have taken control of the main retreat route of the British and Greek Allied forces. (United Press, 22nd)

### German Aircraft Inhumanely Indiscriminately Bomb Innocent Civilians

Athens - Last night, the Greek Ministry of Public Security issued a public statement stating that German aircraft bombed Greek territory, and the suburbs of Athens were also affected. The Germans used machine guns to strafe residents of Akori, causing some casualties. Bombs were dropped on various villages in the regions of Korinth and Missolonghi, as well as places where refugees were concentrated. The Gulf of Euboea was also bombed. The public statement also stated that German aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs during the air raid on the port of Piraeus, resulting in civilian casualties and destruction of houses. Multiple bombs also fell on the outskirts of Eleusis. Furthermore, on Sunday, various islands and cities were subjected to air raids all day long, but only two residents were injured. (Reuters, 22nd)

Istanbul - The Greek Chalki radio station suddenly stopped broadcasting yesterday. According to news received here, the radio station has been destroyed by German bombing. (Haitong, 22nd)

Berlin - The General Command recently issued a war report stating that after the British army was defeated and retreated from the Thessalian Plain in Greece, our army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, giving them no chance to catch their breath. Our bombers continued to bomb the ports of Volos and Chalkis. Our air groups sank two British merchant ships totaling 2,000 tons, all transport ships, and severely damaged two others totaling 12,000 tons, in the seas off the Greek islands of Crete and Euboea. (Havas, 21st)

### Fierce Air Battles Over Athens, 16 German Aircraft Destroyed

Cairo - The British Air Force achieved its greatest victory since the German attack on Greece on Sunday, shooting down at least 16 German aircraft. Fourteen of these were shot down when a large formation of German aircraft engaged in a major battle with British fighters over Athens. These included seven Stuka dive bombers and five Messerschmitt fighters, with one remaining unidentified. Several other German aircraft were also heavily damaged, making them unable to return to base. Seven British aircraft did not return, but it is known that three of the pilots are unharmed. The public statement stated that the British airfields suffered slight damage. On Saturday night, British bombers attacked enemy airfields and advancing enemy columns. The enemy airfield in Katellani was bombed heavily by British heavy bombers, causing a large fire. Aircraft in the Cyrenaica region continued to attack the enemy and its transport convoys and airfields. On the same night, British aircraft fiercely attacked Derna, Benghazi, and Gazala. Due to the dense clouds, it is not known what damage was inflicted. Malta was attacked twice on Sunday, with no damage or casualties. British fighters took off to intercept, shooting down three enemy aircraft and heavily damaging several others. The pilots of the three destroyed enemy aircraft parachuted into the sea. In addition to the seven aircraft missing in Greece, two British bombers also failed to return to base. (Reuters, 22nd)

### New Greek Prime Minister Takes Office, Declares Resolve to Resist, Calls on the Entire Nation to Unite Strongly and Continue to Fight to Defend Freedom

Istanbul - King George of Greece originally intended to serve concurrently as Prime Minister, but has now abandoned this idea and appointed Souteros as Prime Minister. The new Prime Minister will also serve concurrently as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Economy. Lieutenant General Sakellariou will remain in his position as assistant. (Haitong, 22nd)

Athens - Greek Foreign Minister Souteros has been appointed Prime Minister, succeeding Kikritzis. Souteros was sworn in yesterday. Subsequently, Athens Radio Station broadcast his message to the public, stating that the current government will, without hesitation, assume the administration of the country and continue the national resistance until victory is achieved. Only after Greece, the Balkans, and Europe are freed from the shackles of the aggressor will the entire nation continue to fight. It is hoped that the people of the country will summon their courage and ensure that there is no one in Greece who is dejected. The people of the country should trust in the final victory and remain calm and undisturbed during this national crisis. After praising the Greek soldiers who died in battle, Souteros praised the British people, saying that the British are fighting for Greece to uphold justice. Behind Britain, the United States is holding aloft the inextinguishable torch of freedom. The people of the world are moved by this light and will eventually gather their strength to seek their mutual unity and organization, to pass on the crimes of the dark ages that destroyed freedom and peace. With the strength of this allied country and our country, we will surely be able to restore justice. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Italian Governor of Abyssinia Refuses British Surrender Offer, Replies That He Will Fight to the Last Man, Says Britain Should Be Responsible for Protecting White People

Rome - A public statement was issued stating that the Italian Governor of Abyssinia, Duke of Aosta, has completely rejected the British surrender offer and replied to the British forces in Dire Dawa, "The Italian army will fight to the last man." The British surrender offer was based on the reason of protecting civilian lives. (United Press, 26th)

Rome - The Italian official news agency stated that the Italian Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Abyssinia, Duke of Aosta, has refused the request made by British General Cunningham that the Italian army should lay down their arms and surrender, and assured Mussolini that he will lead his troops to struggle everywhere until his death. The news agency also stated that this request was made during discussions on the protection of white people in Abyssinia. General Cunningham told the Italian envoy that if the British side has to bear the responsibility of protecting white people, then the Italian army should lay down their arms and surrender. Upon hearing this, Aosta requested written confirmation. Cunningham sent a letter confirming his verbal statement. Aosta then replied as follows: "I have not considered the military suggestion made by Your Excellency, and I reject it outright. From the time that the British army or the indigenous army you have trained occupies the residential areas of white people, Your Excellency will be responsible for treating white people well." (Reuters, 22nd)

### Istanbul Implements Curfew

Berlin - The German News Agency reported yesterday that Istanbul has declared martial law and implemented a curfew. (International News, 22nd)

### Romania Brewing Civil War, Rumored Soviet Union Secretly Orchestrating, Romanian Prime Minister's Position Shaken

London - It is rumored that the civil war in Romania incited by the Soviet Union is now generally considered inevitable. According to knowledgeable sources here, this action by the Soviet Union has a dual purpose: on the one hand, to prevent the German army's advance in the Balkans, and on the other hand, to help promote the "world revolution." It is expected that the result may be that Germany will completely occupy the two countries of Romania and Bulgaria. It is rumored that secret political police teams carrying paratroopers and mechanized units have concentrated on the Romanian border, preparing to intervene and "restore order." It is believed that the true purpose of the Soviet Union is to provoke a revolution and delay the German attack on India. According to news here, Germany is currently preparing a coup in Afghanistan to reinstate the former King Amanullah, who is now in Berlin. (International News, 22nd)

Budapest - German sources all predict that Romania, in order to end its internal strife, may become a German protectorate, similar to Slovakia. Semi-official Hungarian sources accuse the Soviet Union of instigating the Iron Guard to resist Germany, in order to create an excuse for the Soviet Union to occupy Moldavia. These sources said that Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has become a lone wolf because Germany does not support him. Therefore, it seems that Horia Sima, the leader of the pro-German Iron Guard who is now in exile in Germany, may rise to replace him. (United Press, 22nd)

Budapest - According to news from Hungary yesterday, the government formed by Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has become shaky, as the government has lost the support of Germany and is threatened. It is also rumored here that Soviet troops have concentrated on the Moldavian border, and it is said that all transportation between Hungary and Romania has been suspended. The Romanian National Defense Force occasionally shoots at Hungarian troops who cross into Romania. The source also said that Romanian President Antonescu will lose the support of Germany as a result of disputes over the adjustment of Balkan lands, and that Soviet troops are prepared to enter the province of Moldavia in Romania once Romania disintegrates. (United Press, 22nd)

### Axis Military and Political Leaders Meet in Vienna to Plan New Map of the Balkans; Bulgarian Army Continues to Occupy Southern Greek Territory

Vienna - Today's news reports that Axis military and political leaders are currently holding a meeting in or near Vienna to plan a new map of the Balkans. The borders of this new map may be announced within a few days. This new map includes Yugoslavia, Greece, and Axis satellites bordering these countries. It is being planned by German and Italian leaders and representatives from Hungary, Bulgaria, and the "New State of Croatia." The number one figure planning is Hitler. It is said that Hitler, in a meeting with Bulgarian King Boris, who is visiting the German leader, has roughly delineated the borders of the "New Balkans." Other key figures participating in the meeting include Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. This new map may historically be called "the territory of Southeastern Europe determined by the Belgrade Conference" and will replace the map drawn up by the Allies after the previous European war. (United Press, 22nd)

Vichy - The French news agency reported from Berlin that the Axis powers seized land in the Balkan Peninsula, with the Vardar River as the boundary. The land between the Struma and Maritsa rivers in the Thrace region of Greece is now also occupied by the Bulgarian army. (Note: The port of Dedeagach in this occupied area has long been a demand of Bulgaria to have access to the Aegean Sea. It is believed that the Bulgarian army's occupation of the above two areas is only a preliminary step, and they may soon occupy more areas. The new border is expected to be determined at the meeting to be held in Vienna tomorrow. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have met several times yesterday to prepare for this meeting. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Yugoslav King Peter Flees to Jerusalem, Farewell Declaration Does Not Give Up the Struggle, Plane Attacked En Route, One Cabinet Member Dies

According to Swiss radio news, King Peter of Yugoslavia and others were attacked while flying from Athens to Jerusalem, passing over the Mediterranean Sea. One cabinet member died. Before leaving the capital, King Peter issued a farewell message to the people of the country, saying, "I will not give up the struggle, but will continue to fight so that I can return victorious. Although I am forced to temporarily leave the country due to being overwhelmed by superior enemy forces, this does not mean giving up the struggle. The honor of our national flag has been preserved. I will follow the example of my ancestors and hold high the Yugoslav flag until my death. My flight with the government does not mean that the legitimate representatives of the country have surrendered." (Reuters, 22nd)

### British Warships Gather in Gibraltar

Algeciras - Aircraft from the aircraft carrier "HMS Ark Royal," anchored in the port of Gibraltar, conducted exercises yesterday. At the same time, a British battleship arrived at the port.

### Nazi Air Force Night Raid on England, Plymouth as Target

Berlin - Elite units of the German Air Force attacked Plymouth, an important British naval port, last night. Explosions occurred everywhere, and large fires broke out in various factories and shipyards. (Haitong, 26th)

London - The Ministry of Aviation announced that German aircraft attacked southwestern England last night for a short period of time, but one city was the main target of the bombing. Fires broke out in several places, but they were quickly extinguished and did not spread. Although the bombing was very fierce, the damage and casualties were not as significant as in previous attacks. Bombs also fell on East Anglia, with minimal damage and few casualties. According to news from the German official news agency, German aircraft bombed Portsmouth last night. British fighters shot down a four-engine bomber over an airfield in northern France. (Reuters, 22nd)

### British Troops Continue to Land in Iraq; Soviet-Iranian Border Peaceful

Stockholm - According to a cable from the London correspondent of the "Svenska Dagbladet," British troops continue to land in Iraq. It is learned that Britain will send more troops to Iraq, with the intention of occupying the entire country of Iraq. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Beirut - According to news from the capital of Iraq, Iraqi Prime Minister Gailani declared to a delegation of Iraqi citizens yesterday that any attempt to undermine Iraq's security and independence would provoke a swift response. Gailani did not mention the landing of British troops in Iraq. According to responsible sources, the number of British troops landing in Basra is about 2,000. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Tehran - According to a semi-official Iranian newspaper, rumors circulating abroad that Iranian troops have concentrated on the northern border are not true. Although the Soviet Union is conducting military exercises on the border, Iran is not concentrating troops, and the Soviet-Iranian border remains unobstructed. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Turkey - Political figures here speculate that the British military landing in Basra may be to cover the British retreat from Egypt, or to occupy Syria. After all, Britain's position in Egypt will not be tenable for long, and there is only one remaining route for retreat, which is through Palestine and Iraq to the Persian Gulf, attempting to retreat to India. (Haitong, 22nd)

### Italy Asks United States to Recall Military Attaché, Citing Exceeding Authority

Rome - Responsible sources here declared yesterday that the Italian government's request that the US authorities recall the US military and air attaché to the Italian embassy, Mr. Bartley, was not in retaliation for the US request that Italy withdraw Italian Naval Attaché to the US, Admiral Les. Rather, it was because Bartley exceeded his authority and engaged in activities in a belligerent country that violated the status of a neutral official. Therefore, the decision was made to request the United States to recall him. Les, on the other hand, had not exceeded his authority in any way in the United States. (Haitong, 22nd)

European War Talks (4)(6)

### An Overview of the American Navy

There are two types of sailors: one who spends his time on the deck, and another who spends his days in the engine room. Regardless of whether they are second-class seamen or third-class firemen, they receive a salary of 36 US dollars after twelve weeks of training. Their responsibilities include managing shipboard chores, serving as mine personnel, radio operators, mechanics, etc., all of which are the most basic corporals. When they enlist again at the age of twenty-five, they start as privates and gradually rise in rank, earning 100 US dollars per month. At this point, they can get married and settle down. Sailors can rise to the rank of petty officer, and retire at the age of forty-five with a pension of 1,400 US dollars. The sailor profession may not seem particularly promising, and seafaring involves being far from home, but in reality, the monthly allowance and retirement pay add up to a considerable sum. Moreover, one can rise to the highest rank of petty officer, which, while not bringing glory to one's ancestors, is sufficient to ensure a life free from want.

In the navies of various countries around the world, promotion of officers is primarily based on seniority and years of service, and the same is true in the American Navy. Officers must undergo long periods of training to earn their future. There is only one exception: during wartime, exceptionally meritorious service can lead to surprisingly rapid promotion. The "Annapolis" Naval Academy is the birthplace of officers of all ranks in the American Navy. All personnel involved in designing and building ships, and organizing warships for combat, come from this school.

Graduates of "Annapolis" begin their careers in the Navy as lieutenants with gold stripes. The final stage for the aforementioned sailors is the starting point for these graduates. They must spend seven years at sea. First, they spend three or four years studying various important components on battleships. Then, they spend three years practicing on destroyers or submarines. After these seven years, they earn the title of lieutenant and are reassigned to shore duty to pursue specialized studies at naval officer schools. At the age of thirty, they are reassigned to ships, serving as naval captains.

After this, they undergo rigorous screening, as the position of rear admiral is very rare and precious. This screening is difficult to pass. Of the four hundred students in a class, at least twenty-five percent will have been eliminated by this stage. By the time they are thirty-seven, only one hundred and fifty remain qualified for the position of naval major; by the age of forty-three, the number is even smaller, with only eighty serving as naval lieutenant colonels. Forty of these are assigned to serve as captains of various ships, and the number who will achieve the ultimate goal of rear admiral will be less than ten. The specialized field of study they choose also has an impact on their position. Traditionally, gunnery ranks first. Specializing in aviation at Pensacola is also a shortcut to success at present. Other fields, such as diplomacy, architecture, engineering, strategy, and law, are also broadly covered in the Navy.

An officer's future depends not only on his talent, but also on his integrity and character. Congressional laws recognize him as a proper gentleman, entitled to a title before his name. On board, he is entitled to a private cabin and a servant at his beck and call. The officers' wardroom has a "private club" for relaxation. The salary and various allowances can reach 4,000 US dollars, enough to marry and start a family.

In the current emergency, the promotion of these lieutenants and captains is often surprisingly rapid if they achieve meritorious service. Perhaps in a few months, they can jump to the rank of major, which would normally take seven years to achieve in peacetime. If they perform exceptionally during combat, the position of lieutenant colonel can be obtained without having to wait six years. Finally, they can be promoted to the rank of general, with a flag on the ship, managing a fleet, and retiring as a rear admiral at the age of sixty-four. According to naval custom, the sons of rear admirals often "follow in their father's footsteps" and enter the Navy.

Due to the expansion of the military, the United States Navy urgently needs a large number of officers in both oceans. Although the authorities have recalled retirees and shortened the training period at "Annapolis" to three years, the current need for 25,000 personnel has not been met. In addition to military academies, the United States Department of the Navy has also established reserve training centers in various locations to supplement the personnel from military academies.

(6) Naval Bases

Rear Admiral Mahan of the United States Navy once said, "A navy is composed of personnel, ships, and bases, the most important of which are personnel, ships, and bases." Naval bases are the lifeblood of all sizes of warships and are of great significance. Modern naval fleets can never operate more than 2,500 miles away from their naval bases. (To be continued)

### The Municipal Council's Administration Temporarily Managed by the Old Board of Directors; Temporary Board of Directors Difficult to Establish Soon; No Definite Reply from the Consular Body

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reports that, according to sources in official circles today (the 22nd), the temporary board of directors passed by the special meeting of taxpayers of the Public Concession last week will be difficult to establish soon. The biggest reason is due to the opposition of the Chinese government. A spokesman for the Municipal Council stated today that the consuls of various countries here will announce their decisions on this matter soon. However, before a decision is made, the administration of the Public Concession will continue to be managed by the current Board of Directors. It is reported that the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday (the 21st), but the contents of the meeting are unknown. Former Chairman Cornabe is about to leave Shanghai, so yesterday's meeting was chaired by Mitchell. Danish Consul General and Dean of the Consular Body Hill stated this morning that he does not know when the consuls of various countries here will be able to give a definite reply on the issue of the temporary board of directors. There is nothing to announce on this issue at present, but a formal statement may be issued soon.

MacDonald's Speech Published

At the special meeting of taxpayers on the 17th of this month, when the proposal of Cornabe and Okamoto to change the organization of the Municipal Council and establish a temporary board of directors was discussed, only MacDonald opposed the proposal. He gave a speech, which, although humorous, failed to win the support of the attendees. However, he was the only one who spoke out loudly about this matter. MacDonald's speech was published by the Municipal Council's Information Office last night. It is translated below: "Mr. Chairman and comrades, I call you so because, politically and municipally, you and your future have encountered the most serious and difficult problem. If I am prohibited from speaking midway and unable to express my opinions, as I was last year, then I will fundamentally and forever oppose this resolution. In my view, this resolution is the most terrible 'abortion' in human thought, a cursed and cruel resolution. You also know its importance. Most of you, or at least a part of you, have probably read Mr. Cornabe's speech, which is like the thinnest layer of sugar coating the most poisonous medicine, and is something I have never seen before. Verbal guarantees have no legal binding force and are as worthless as the government's so-called public or even gentleman's agreement. Therefore, although the chairman of the Municipal Council is a very close friend of mine, if he can understand me, I also ask the audience to understand him (the audience laughs), because he has no choice but to do so due to circumstances. Now, please listen to my analysis of this resolution, but before I do so, I ask you to remember what Hamlet said in Shakespeare's play, 'It is, it is,' and Antony's speech on Caesar's body. The language of these two people is very accurate when compared to the present situation. For the past eighteen years, we have suffered from the authorities' poor management. They sat proudly in the taxpayers' meeting, like ancient gladiators, but without their merits. Therefore, we have made a big mistake in electing them as the people to manage us. We have heard the breeze of freedom in the past eighteen years. The achievements they have built have brought us into the stratosphere, as they have increased the Municipal Council's expenditure by 500 percent. In their eyes, this is as insignificant as a mosquito bite, but you may not yet know that they have increased the expenditure on old-age pensions and exchange subsidies by 35,000 percent. However, we should endure the pain we know, as it is better than escaping the pain we do not know. If there is anyone among us who likes the relationship between prehistoric people and pigs, please cut his throat himself, and must cut it from the left ear to the right ear. On the other hand, if anyone likes to be the leader of sheep, he only needs to make a small hole in his throat (the audience laughs). But as far as I know, what is the difference in the result? If corpses are also taxed, then why should we die? The grievances we are suffering are even worse than what Rehoboam said in Chapter 12 of the Books of Kings, as Rehoboam always refused to listen to the advice of the elders and preferred to consult with young people. It is said that Rehoboam said, 'If my father put a yoke on you, I will put another yoke on top of it. If my father punished you with whips, then I will punish you with scorpion whips.' Fellow comrades, what this resolution gives to your corpses (not to you) is worth sixteen Rehoboams! (Laughter) If you are deceived by sweet words, then I ask you to pay attention to what the third clause of the proposal says, that is, the term of office of the directors of the temporary board of directors shall not be less than one year. If the resolution says that it shall not be more than one year, then there is still time to add artificial sweat to the corpse, but now it is stipulated that it shall not be less than one year, then your grave trees have already grown. Although this meeting is not a banquet of Belshazzar, there are no nobles, beauties, wine, and meat. Therefore, I think it is also very suitable to call a meeting at the slaughterhouse, but my eyesight is not bad, because I can still see a hand writing 'Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin' on the wall behind you or on the podium. But if you can reject this proposal, you can stop this hand and the terrible and fatal word 'Peres.'"

### New US Ambassador to China, Gauss's Travel Plans

It is rumored that the new US Ambassador to China, Gauss, will come to China soon to take up his new post. A reporter from *Ping Ming News* learned from a senior official at the US Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday that there is no definite report on the new ambassador's travel plans. However, according to his speculation, Gauss and his family will reunite in their hometown and then set off for China, around the end of next month. According to news, the current US Ambassador, Johnson, will return to the United States after the new ambassador arrives in China to report everything to Washington before going to Australia to take up his post. The new and old ambassadors will meet in Hong Kong.

### British Royal Air Force Organizes a Sino-British Squadron

The British government has recently decided to organize a squadron of the British Royal Air Force, named the "Sino-British Squadron." The reason for this decision is that the funds, totaling 100,000 British pounds, were all raised by British people in China. The Royal Air Force squadron was originally named the "Anglo-Chinese Squadron" on January 30 of this year. Now, the British government authorities, in order to respect China, as the funds were donated by British friends and British nationals in China, specially renamed it the "Sino-British Squadron." After the squadron is organized and established, it will be ready to be active in the sky at any time and serve in the front lines.

### Briquettes on the Black Market Rise Again

A few days ago, the coal market once tended to stabilize, and major coal companies also disposed of their stockpiles separately. The amount of spot goods in the market gradually increased, and the black market price of briquettes once fell from 196 yuan per ton to 186 yuan. Due to the abundance of spot goods in the market, the sales were quite sluggish. Due to the unstable international situation in the Soviet Union, speculators continued to act, insisting on hoarding goods and refusing to supply them to the market, causing anxiety among the people. The black market price of briquettes was raised by about 10 yuan, and it has now recovered to the highest price of a week ago. According to the actual situation, there is no reason for the price of briquettes to continue to rise. It is now known that various coal industry associations are trying to stop it, but it is not known whether they can fulfill their duties.

### Japanese Military Police Arrested a Chinese Man Named Wang in the French Concession, Now Detained in the French Police Station Awaiting Investigation

The Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou sent military police to the French Police Station at 11:30 AM yesterday, requesting that detectives be dispatched to search No. 6, Huanlong Lane, Huanlong Road, and arrest a man named Wang. The father waited in the house, and they did not withdraw until 12:00 PM. However, the arrested Wang is now detained in the French Police Station awaiting investigation, but the reason for the arrest is unknown. According to another rumor, the Wang was arrested in Hongkou by detectives in early autumn last year and has been held for half a year. Yesterday, the headquarters sent personnel to escort Wang to the French Police Station, requesting that detectives be dispatched to search his residence at No. 6, Huanlong Lane. The results of the search are unknown.

### The Nanshi Area Suddenly Announced a State of Tension Yesterday Morning, Residents Forbidden from Entering the Concession, Rumors of an Escaped Prisoner from the Japanese Military Police, All Iron Gates in the French Concession Were Temporarily Closed

From 6:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese side in Nanshi suddenly announced a special curfew. Japanese military police squads and Japanese military police officers were deployed at key traffic points along the Mingguo Road, and the situation was extremely tense for a time. All iron gates in the French Concession were temporarily closed as a result, and then immediately opened. During the curfew yesterday morning, Nanshi residents going to the concession were blocked and not allowed to leave the area, while residents going to Nanshi from the concession were not prohibited from entering Nanshi. However, they had to hold a certificate to enter, and they had to enter from Xinqiao Street and Xinkaihe. At 11:00 AM, the Japanese side announced that Nanshi residents could enter the concession from Xinkaihe, but all other places were still prohibited from leaving the area. At noon, traffic was restored. It was later learned that the Japanese side's implementation of the curfew was due to the escape of two prisoners being held by the Japanese military police in Nanshi in the early morning. After the incident, the Japanese side implemented strict vigilance and conducted a major search. It is not possible to ascertain whether the escaped prisoners have been re-arrested.

Reported in Western Newspapers

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reports that the Japanese authorities in Nanshi closed the iron gates along the French Concession this morning (the 22nd) without stating the reason. Chinese sources say that a Japanese soldier was shot in Nanshi at 9:00 AM this morning, but the Japanese side denies this. According to them, there were no unusual incidents in Nanshi this morning, and the closure of the iron gates is a common occurrence and has no special significance.

### Water and Electricity Surcharges in the French Concession Will Increase Significantly, Increase Will Be Implemented Before the End of This Month, Fuel Shortage Forces Severe Measures

The *North-China Daily News* reported yesterday (the 21st) that the French-owned water and electricity company in Shanghai, due to rising costs and deteriorating fuel conditions, is about to significantly increase the water and electricity surcharges charged to users in the concession. The implementation date may be before the end of this month. It is heard that the company will soon notify the French Consulate in Shanghai of this intention. It is believed that the electricity surcharge will increase from 103 percent to 125 percent. (This resolution still means the increase is less, as the previous increase was from 97 percent to 103 percent). The electricity surcharge is currently 140 percent and is expected to increase to 190 percent. The electricity surcharge for electric cookers and heaters will also be handled accordingly (the previous increase was from 97 percent to 140 percent).

Electricity Bills Soar, More Than Tripled

The water surcharge will increase from 49 percent to 75 percent. It is noted that a year ago, the electricity (motor) and heating surcharges were both 60 percent, and the water surcharge was 30 percent. In the past twelve months, except for water, electricity surcharges have more than tripled. Although electricity prices in the French Concession have increased, they are still considered low compared to electricity prices in Zhabei and the Public Concession. The most expensive is Zhabei, because residents of Zhabei have to exchange legal tender for military scrip to pay for water and electricity.

Greatest Impact on the Public Concession

Due to the low value of the currency, electricity prices here are still lower than anywhere else in the Far East or the world. The Shanghai Power Company and the French-owned water and electricity company have recently had to take severe measures to limit electricity consumption as much as possible due to fuel shortages. This measure has a greater impact on the Public Concession, as factories located in the Public Concession account for almost 96 percent.

### Weiguang Hospital Offers Free Smoking Cessation, Wang Fen Donates 1,000 Yuan

Yesterday, Mr. Wang Fen submitted a letter to this newspaper, saying, "To the esteemed chief editor, twenty years ago, due to illness, I became addicted to smoking and sank into the dark sea, which was unspeakable suffering. I had tried to quit in hospitals in Shanghai and Hankou as many as six times, but all failed due to the unbearable pain during withdrawal, and I gave up halfway without quitting. This time, I came to Shanghai and, through the introduction of a friend, entered Weiguang Hospital in Siming Lane, Avenue Joffre, and stayed for seven days. Without delirium or drowsiness, I was able to detoxify and eliminate my addiction unknowingly. Moreover, I was comfortable and peaceful during the seven days, without any pain. It is truly thanks to the high level of medical skill of Dr. Li that I was able to achieve such good results. Since being discharged from the hospital, I have been refreshed, my appetite has increased sharply, and my health has improved greatly. I am deeply grateful, so I have donated 1,000 yuan in national currency to the hospital so that anyone who is determined to quit smoking but lacks the means can enjoy a free chance to quit. I know that this is a drop in the bucket, and it is difficult to meet all needs with my limited resources, but I hope to inspire others and that collective will can build a great wall. Moreover, the government has now promulgated new and strict anti-smoking laws. I urge all blacklisted comrades to get rid of their bad habits as soon as possible, turn back to the shore, and avoid severe punishment in the future. Therefore, I have specifically submitted this letter, requesting your newspaper to publicize and introduce it, so that those who are determined to quit but lack the means can get out of the sea of misery as soon as possible. This is my sincere hope." With respect, Wang Fen, April 21, 1941. (Anyone requesting free smoking cessation can send a letter to this newspaper to be forwarded to Weiguang Hospital).

### Staff of the Commercial Press Demand, The Management Has Not Yet Accepted, The Main and Branch Offices Were Closed Yesterday Afternoon, The Police Authorities Persuade Negotiations Today

The Commercial Press Staff Association, because the demands it had made were not accepted by the management, convened a general meeting on the evening of the previous day. All staff members attended and resolved to put forward four final conditions to the company: (1) The company is required to maintain the minimum wage rate from April. (2) Refusal to transfer until the life of Shanghai colleagues is safe. (3) Immediately return the arrears after the war. (4) Abolish unreasonable contracts and not dismiss colleagues without reason. The conditions

The Management Firmly Refuses, The Staff's Conditions

Were formally submitted to the company at 9:00 AM yesterday and were firmly rejected by the management, causing the staff to become anxious. A general meeting was convened at 2:00 PM, and a go-slow was started from 3:30 PM. From 5:00 PM, the iron gates were pulled shut, slogans were posted, a strike was implemented, and business was suspended. From the manager down,

All Fast, Expressing Determination

All 600-plus people remained inside, fasting for 48 hours in order to urge the management to thoroughly awaken. The association will not resume work until the measures are announced. It is reported that the association will issue a letter to compatriots, appealing to all sectors for assistance.

Late Yesterday Night, Employees Left the Building

Afterwards, when this reporter went to the building to investigate, dozens of Chinese and Western detectives from the Central Police Station had been dispatched to suppress the strike. The manager, Bao Qinglin, and the head of the personnel section, Shi Jiu-yun, were first protected and escorted out. Afterwards, all 500-plus employees were gathered in the lower-level business department, where the Western police chief patiently persuaded them to engage in sincere negotiations between labor and management today, to support each other, and to cope with the difficult times. It was not until around 11:00 PM that all the employees withdrew and returned to their residences.

### Surcharges on Foreign Rice Rise Steadily, The Rice Market Is Uncontrolled, Market Detectives Arrest Rice Profiteers Who Exceed Limits, Released Due to Lack of Evidence

The rice market is out of control, and with speculation rampant, the entire rice market is becoming increasingly chaotic. Black market surcharges are rampant. After the market opened yesterday, there was an initial surge in prices, causing panic and rumors. Major players insisted on hoarding goods and refused to supply the market, resulting in a shortage of spot goods in the market and surcharges rising steadily. Today, the surcharge for No. 1 tribute rice was fiercely raised to

1,800 yuan, which is 18 yuan beyond the limit per bag. The surcharge for second-class goods also requires 1,400 to 1,500 yuan, which is unexpected. After the rice market opened yesterday, due to the increasingly chaotic market conditions, the authorities' detectives were densely distributed around the market, detecting the illegal activities of rice profiteers. Liu Jingzhi, the representative of Defeng Grain Store, No. 133 Nanjing Road, actually obtained a market entry permit from Wang Yuji Rice Store, No. 518 Jiujiang Road, and mixed into the rice market yesterday morning, attempting to sell 100 bags of Western broken rice beyond the limit. He was discovered by the detectives and immediately arrested and taken to the Central Police Station. After investigation, due to lack of evidence, he was released at 5:00 PM that afternoon. The authorities are urged to investigate and punish rice profiteers strictly to warn others. Also,

Foreign rice arrives in Shanghai continuously and in large quantities. Yesterday, the French company Bernardin & de Porre's ship brought 39,000 bags of foreign rice directly from Saigon. Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yuan Sheng Wheel, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday and brought 4,904 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. In total, three ships brought 70,000 bags of foreign rice yesterday, and a large number of shipments are still on the way. In the past, rice stocks in this city have also been extremely sufficient, so there is no shortage. It is very clear that rice prices should not rise wildly.

### Spitting Habits, Publicity Week to Begin Tomorrow, Spitting Penalties Will Be Formulated

The Shanghai Women's Organizations Joint Association has set the date for the annual Health Campaign Publicity Week from the 24th to the 30th of this month. The main focus of this campaign is to eliminate the bad habit of spitting. In addition to having the cooperation of the authorities in the two concessions to have storytellers in various playgrounds tell public health stories during this week, pictures and slogans will also be posted in the display windows of Yong'an, Xinxin, and other major companies to attract attention from all sectors. However, the association does not plan to have any special publicity activities in schools this year, as it knows that the schools have automatically promoted public health this year and have achieved considerable results, so there is no need for further publicity. However, the general public still does not pay much attention to the bad habit of spitting. It is heard that the Public Works Department is planning to formulate spitting penalties. Before the penalties are implemented, the Women's Organizations Joint Association will conduct this publicity campaign again in order to encourage citizens to automatically abolish the bad habit of spitting everywhere, so as to avoid being subject to mandatory restrictions in the future. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will work hard to promote it from now on. The association has saved a part of the publicity expenses and donated it to the Anti-Tuberculosis Association.

### A Murder for Money Occurred in Meilong Northern Township

At Shenjiayan, three li north of Meilong Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, a shocking murder for money occurred on the night of the 12th of last month. The deceased were the wife of villager Shen Botao, Madam Shen Zhang, and his ten-year-old grand-nephew, Linggen. Their bodies were stabbed dozens of times with sharp scissors, the flesh a bloody mess, too horrible to look upon. That night, Shen Botao happened to be selling fresh flowers in Shanghai and had not returned. When he returned home at dawn and witnessed this tragic scene, he was overcome with grief and nearly went insane. Subsequently, villagers in the area jointly reported the incident, requesting a strict search for the murderer. After vigorous investigation, the murderer has already been apprehended and is currently being interrogated severely to deter other evildoers.

### Hua Army Reinforcements Stabilize the War Situation in Eastern Zhejiang; Postal and Telegraph Communications Between Shanghai and Various Locations Are Interrupted; Issuance of Certificates for Returning to Ningbo and Wenzhou Temporarily Suspended

The situation in Eastern Zhejiang has become increasingly tense since the expansion of the war. Postal and telegraph communications between Shanghai and Zhejiang, along the coastal areas, have been interrupted. Hua army reinforcements are now arriving at the front lines in large numbers, and the war situation is expected to stabilize. Details are recorded below:

Major Forces Repel Attack; Offensive Thwarted

News received yesterday by Zhejiang provincial organizations in Shanghai: (1) The Japanese troops who landed in Zhenhai continued to attack Ningbo, invading Jiangdong and engaging in street fighting. Japanese cavalry were also spotted in the Zhuangqiao and Luotuoqiao areas, but retreated after being intercepted by the garrison. (2) After landing in Wenzhou, Haimen, Huangyan, and other places under the cover of aircraft and artillery, the Japanese troops were met by the garrison, and their offensive was thwarted. (3) Liu Jianxu, commander-in-chief of the [illegible] Army Group, has led a large force to the front lines to reinforce the battle, and a new development in the war is imminent.

Postal and Telegraph Communications Interrupted; Shipping Suspended

Postal and telegraph communications between Shanghai and Zhejiang have been suspended due to the chaotic situation along the coast. However, postal and telegraph communications between Shanghai and Jinhua, Lishui, and other inland areas of Zhejiang Province remain normal and unobstructed. Foreign merchant ships sailing between Shanghai and Shipu, Haidou, Wenzhou, Aojiang, and other places have also been completely suspended, and many are stranded in Shanghai, awaiting developments in the situation before deciding on their next course of action.

Government Agencies Relocate to Rural Areas to Conduct Business

Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, and other native place associations in Shanghai telegraphed the local government agencies some days ago to inquire about the details, but have not yet received a reply. However, according to sources, county governments and other agencies in various coastal areas of Eastern Zhejiang have relocated to the countryside to conduct business. Most organizations and schools had already moved to the countryside for business and classes after the Japanese troops briefly invaded Zhenhai in July last year, and most of the residents in the urban areas have also been evacuated.

Certificates for Returning Home Suspended

The Ningbo and Wenzhou native place associations in Shanghai previously issued certificates to facilitate the return of fellow villagers who wished to travel to Ningbo and Wenzhou. However, due to the expansion of the war and the disruption of transportation, the issuance of such certificates has been suspended from today.

### Another Westerner Commits Suicide by Shooting

He died instantly. It is reported that Mr. Kaishier had reported to the Central Police Station last Saturday, stating that he was engaged in the export business and had hired a Chinese man named Xu in June. He trusted Xu greatly because of his sincerity and diligence. Recently, he gave Xu 39,000 yuan to negotiate a certain transaction. Unexpectedly, Xu disappeared with the money. After Mr. Kaishier returned home, he was utterly despondent due to the loss of funds. At around 8 PM on Sunday, after finishing dinner with his wife, he left home alone and jumped from the building, dying instantly on the sidewalk. In his suicide note to his wife, Mr. Kaishier stated that he was forced to take this desperate measure due to business pressures.

### Food; Over 70,000 Bags of Rice Arrived in One Day; Stone Rice Still Surging by Six or Seven Yuan; How Heartbreaking! Shanghai's Food for the People; How Delightful! Shanghai's Hoarders

Yesterday's rice market was even more exuberant, with spot prices surging wildly. The black-hearted profiteers continued to exert their power, and the speculative ball was kicked higher and higher. Those heartless people only care about their own wealth and do not care that most people will starve to death. The rice market has reached this point, and there is no solution. There is a sense of despair. As soon as the market opened in the morning, there were large buyers bidding up the price. With a wave of their magic hands, the market price rose rapidly. The skin ball gang had a way to make money, and the spot prices were raised step by step. No. 1 Saigon early market was 1,300 to 1,400 yuan, mid-market was 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, afternoon market was 1,800 to 1,900 yuan, No. 2 was 1,300 to 1,500 yuan, small grain early was 1,300 to [illegible] yuan, then to 1,600 to 1,700 yuan, Siamese rice was 1,500 yuan to 1,650 yuan, broken rice was also from 1,000 to 1,200 yuan, stone rice also reached nearly 1,000 yuan, and other rice was also jumping and surging, increasing by five, six, or seven yuan compared to the previous market. Although there was no official market in the afternoon, the speculators' greed had not yet waned. Before the evening market, there were rumors that the buyers were not in harmony, and the market began to stabilize. The daily transaction on the market was less than 10,000 bags, but the number of black market transactions that directly changed the names of the households is difficult to estimate. They are all sitting idly by while hoarders commit evil deeds, and the people's food is difficult to obtain. They do not try to save the situation, and even if every grain of rice is like a pearl, they still do not ask or hear about it. How heartbreaking is Shanghai's food for the people, how delightful are Shanghai's hoarders.

A large amount of foreign rice is still arriving in Shanghai. The Hualun Foreign Company's Gelan Wheel directly [illegible] from Saigon with 20,000 [illegible] 313 bags of foreign rice, arrived at the port yesterday morning, and berthed at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to unload. The French company's Bernardin de st pierre Wheel also directly transported 3,850 tons of foreign rice from Saigon, totaling about 39,000, and imported it yesterday morning, berthing at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou to unload. The Jardine Matheson's Yuansheng Wheel brought 4,904 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and berthed at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou to unload. Yesterday, a total of more than 70,000 bags of foreign rice arrived. (Ancestor)

The price of thick and thin japonica rice and glutinous rice followed the rice and soared. A chaotic phenomenon is difficult to describe. It has reached the point where people are willing to pay high prices, but cannot buy goods. According to legend, Wuxi japonica rice is selling for 126 yuan, Kunshan japonica rice is 122 or 123 yuan, and Qingjiao thin rice is 126 or 127 yuan, while glutinous rice is also selling for 123 yuan, and glutinous tea is 118 or 119 yuan, all soaring by as much as five or six yuan compared to before.

### Flour Spot Goods; Firmly Held Back

The flour market situation has returned to tightness and stability. This is because rice prices have been rising for several days, and various [illegible] rumors have sprung up, prompting people to prosper. Generally, those who hoard spot goods are determined to maintain the main [illegible]. In addition, retail sales to the north and south are still endless, so the market situation is tight. It is reported that those who directly distribute goods outside the market are quoting 30 yuan and 5 and a half cents to 67 cents for Hua Niao Zhonglou brand Australian flour, 29 yuan and 90 cents for Jinlong Pi Kan flour, and 29 yuan and 45 cents for Huangniu brand. Australian flour has been stored until it is exhausted, and the market is quite tight. Kan flour has a lot of new arrivals and is cheaper than Australian flour. There are also new brands that have recently arrived, such as Airplane and Steamship brands, which are even cheaper than other brands.

Wheat transactions are as quiet as ever. Inland arrivals have been interrupted invisibly. On the Chinese factory side, the demand for raw materials is not urgent for purchases. In reality [illegible], they want to buy but there are no goods. Japanese factories also collected very little in the market, and the market price is still between 45 [illegible] yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains; Where Did the Price Limit Come From; Corn and Bean Cakes Soar

Yesterday's tense situation for corn and bean cakes was like the madness before the small [illegible] Spring Festival.

### Sugar Speculation Intensifies; Market Temporarily Suspended Yesterday

Seeing this situation, the giants in the industry feared that it would cause other changes, so they announced the suspension of the market at 10:00 AM after the market opened in the morning, hoping to have a proper solution to handle the aftermath. The association fixed the spot price of 24 coarse white sugar at 102 yuan, which then rose to 105 yuan, 7 yuan. The price of futures for the end of April went from 101 yuan to 2 yuan, 3 yuan, 4 yuan, 5 yuan, 6 yuan, and up to 278 yuan. The price for May 10th fluctuated the most. The opening price was only 101 yuan, then from 112 yuan [illegible] to 3 yuan, 4 yuan, 5 yuan, 6 yuan, 7 yuan, even higher, to a maximum price of 1089 yuan. Later, it was suddenly reported that [illegible]'s stored sugar was prevented from being [illegible] by a certain party, and the price plummeted to 90 [illegible] yuan. This kind of fluctuation was unprecedented. Later, it rebounded slightly to 102 yuan. The market was still suspended in the afternoon. It is hoped that there will be a better solution today to avoid causing major changes.

### Securities; Bond Market Changed Several Times; The Result Was Still Short Covering

The over-the-counter market for public bonds fluctuated rapidly yesterday. The price rose and fell by one yuan in each session, making people feel flustered. From this, it can be seen that the tense situation has made people feel uneasy. However, the incident in eastern Zhejiang is unlikely to expand. There is a rumor that the four banks will resume business on Thursday. The bond market suddenly fell by one yuan in the afternoon, but rebounded by one yuan at the close. The rapid rise and fall caused speculators to rush around. Based on the closing situation and the news after the close, it is expected that there will be a rebound today. Yesterday morning, Yitai initially bought in, and the market price went from low to high. Juxin and Tongkang supplied [illegible]. After entering, Runli and Hengzi bought in, while Xie Kang and Jiufeng sold out in large quantities. The market price suddenly fell, and then broke through one yuan.

The British exchange rate of 3 [illegible] 15625 was once difficult to settle, and the US dollar softened to 5 yuan 125. The stability was still stable in the early afternoon, and the news that American [illegible] was withdrawing from Hong Kong, the British bank took advantage and forcefully sold it earlier. The speculators' sell-off followed, and the gold price also gradually fell to the border of the 6,700 yuan range, so it rebounded slightly to the evening close. The British exchange rate was 3 [illegible] 171875, the US dollar was 5 yuan [illegible] 5625, which was a total of 0.015625 for the British tightening and 0.03125 for the US tightening.

Before the morning opening and before the evening closing, the price twice broke through the 6,700 yuan mark. People were in an uncertain state of mind. Initially, rumors of favorable news from the previous day were difficult to verify. Reports indicated that both domestic and international news sources were mostly bearish, causing many to waver. The morning opening was 20 yuan lower. Subsequently, securities firms and draft dealers strongly supported the price, pulling it up. However, as the exchange rate returned from tight to neutral, and HSBC's initial listing did not show a decrease in margin requirements, those who were overextended became even more anxious. Gold dealers forcefully sold, causing the price to fall sharply to 6,600 yuan and several tens of yuan. Only briefly did it appear to rally, as securities firms and silver firms came to support the price. The open and black market exchange rates both contracted, fueling the bullish sentiment, and the price soared to a high of 6,770 yuan. At noon, draft dealers sold to profit, causing a slight dip. Unexpectedly, within a minute after the afternoon close, the price suddenly jumped again. In the afternoon, the Guangdong firms heavily shorted, and securities firms re-emerged. The market momentum was downward, and there were also reports of Hong Kong Overseas Chinese withdrawing. The exchange rate hardened, and those who were overextended rushed to sell, causing the price to retreat to around the 6,700 yuan mark. Ultimately, it fell by a small amount of 25 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 40,000 to 50,000 taels. For swaps (April to May), buyers offered 32 yuan, while sellers demanded 38 yuan. The spot price was relatively stable.

Meiyuan, Tongkangyong, Defu, Hengji, Tianyuan, Yongcheng, and Gonghe all entered the market. Around 10 o'clock, the exchange rate suddenly tightened, and the price soared.

Later, seeing securities firms and silver firms forcefully squeezing the market, it was reduced to 6,755 yuan. Dafeng, Xinfengyong, and draft dealers absorbed the supply, raising it to 6,768 yuan. Nearing 3:00 PM, bearish rumors suddenly arose, and the US dollar hardened again. The market momentum was very weak. Hengji shorted up to 4,000 taels. Defu, Xianghe, Yida, Yuxingyong, Gonghe, and others scrambled to sell. Many retail investors liquidated, and the price subsequently fell, dropping by 78 yuan, and once saw a low price of 6,690 yuan.

There was a balanced supply and demand for Korean bills, and the market price remained flat, at 1 yuan 8 jiao 3 fen in the evening market.

### Yarn and Flower Speculation Continues, Bullish Momentum Remains Strong

The yarn market rebounded and the rising trend looks promising. This is due to rising spot gold prices and the tightening of foreign exchange rates, leading to positive sentiment and triggering buying activity. The market once reached a high price. However, the ongoing war in eastern Zhejiang led some profitable investors to sell, and the market became more relaxed. Nevertheless, demand from Hong Kong firms remained strong, and the rising gold price further strengthened the bullish momentum. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,522 yuan, and the low price was 1,508 yuan. The initial transaction price in the afternoon was 1,516-1,517 yuan, and the closing price was 1,486 yuan. Today, 3,665 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The Shuangma yarn opened with continued strong momentum from the previous evening. The initial price was 1,515 yuan, and it soon rose to 1,522 yuan. However, profit-taking caused the market to loosen again, falling to 1,512 yuan. Subsequently, news of rising spot gold prices caused speculative buying activity to surge, and the price rebounded to 1,521 yuan. However, some sold due to the intense warfare, and the price fell back to 1,508 yuan. The closing price rose slightly to 1,513 yuan. It is found that the total volume of transactions in half a day was 7,800 bales. The breakdown of purchases by each firm is as follows:

Hong Kong 1,000; Peers 6,800; Total 7,800

### Quiet Cotton Market, 2,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Continue to Arrive

The spot cotton market has returned to a quiet state. Transaction volume is not as active as before, but inventory is not high, and sentiment among dealers remains positive. Holders are still unwilling to sell, leading to a mediocre market condition. The current spot cotton market prices are listed below:

Indian Langzhen 36.5, Junchang 100 bales, Huozhaocao 198.25, Tongyu 200 bales

Indian cotton continues to arrive. The Taikoo Company's Hunan vessel previously transported over 800 bales of Indian cotton from Hong Kong to Shanghai, which has been reported. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson's Yuansheng vessel transported 2,000 bales of cotton from Kolkata. (Year)

Another news report on foreign cotton trading in Shanghai's foreign firms: On one hand, the unsettled situation and fluctuating yarn market have led to a slightly subdued sentiment. On the other hand, continuous arrivals in recent days have resulted in significant purchases by various parties, slightly suppressing their enthusiasm. However, the market condition remains stable. A small number of dealers and factories are making sporadic purchases, so the future is optimistic, and the cotton market is still expected to develop actively.

The New York cotton market fell initially due to selling by foreign merchants, but rebounded afterward due to purchases by dealers and New Orleans futures, resulting in a closing price that was higher by 2 to 5 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell initially due to selling by cotton merchants and retail investors, and the liquidation of positions by various large firms. However, it rebounded slightly afterward due to the situation favoring bulls. The closing price was down by about three rupees. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be bullish by one rupee.

### Minor Price Increases in Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth

The factory cloth market saw a slight rebound yesterday, with a firm trend, due to the continued increase in production costs at the factories. Demand for spot sales from local and Guangdong/Nanyang firms remained strong. However, sales channels in Zhejiang and Fujian were temporarily disrupted. Coarse twill cloth rose by 5 jiao, and coarse cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao. Prices for fine cloth, fine twill, and bleached/dyed cloth remained flat. The Muchang Street market traded 500-plus pieces of various cloth types. Guangdong and Hong Kong firms purchased over 300 pieces of blue cloth and twill goods.

Dongbu: Longtou fine cloth opened at 51.75 jiao in the morning and closed at 51.55 jiao at noon. Due to sluggish spot sales in the afternoon, selling offers continued to soften, and the price fell to 51.25 jiao at closing. Sijunzi serge opened at 1 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen in the morning and closed at 1 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 2.5 li in the evening.

### Medicinal Materials: Pangolin Scales' Price Soars by Hundreds

In summary, the West Youth team defeated the Soviet team in straight sets. Currently, in Group A, the West Youth team and the Russian Overseas Chinese team each have four wins and one loss, forming a balanced situation.

Spring and Autumn

### A Meal

— Zuo Hui

A letter came from the countryside, reporting a long description of the famine disaster, ending with a request that fellow villagers in Shanghai think of a solution. Speaking of relatives, my aunt's husband is currently the most successful, and the letter naturally mentioned him, so I set off for my aunt's house in the drizzling rain.

My uncle was busy with official matters and not at home, so I talked to my aunt about eating bran, starving to death, and asking for relief. My aunt is illiterate, so she wouldn't understand if I told her in general terms. Therefore, I had to use all my verbal skills to meticulously describe the disaster; however, my aunt's family is doing well, and hearing me repeatedly talk about starvation and eating bran, she became somewhat unhappy. On the other hand, the Shaoxing maid listened with her mouth agape, looking quite distressed. Following the same steps as the letter from the village, I first recounted a long series of hardships and tragedies, and finally, I asked my aunt to think of a solution. Of course, thinking of a solution meant my aunt had to use her wealth-making hand, but my aunt frowned, as if she was annoyed that I was so verbose. She retorted, "Aren't your whole family in Shanghai? For other families, I think you should talk to your uncle about it."

In reality, if my family were also in the countryside, my aunt wouldn't necessarily be generous.

The maid came to announce that dinner was ready. Good, rice is expensive, and my nephew, the emperor, is going to freeload off his aunt today.

I walked into the dining room and sat down at the table. Only three people were sitting at the table. If you exclude me, then only my aunt and cousin are eating. Heaven is truly teasing people, as someone like my aunt happens to have only two people eating.

I don't know if my aunt was being polite or sincere, but she said, "Yi Hui, eat up, don't be polite at your aunt's house."

So, I didn't stand on ceremony and habitually picked up my rice bowl. After taking only a few bites, suddenly, with a "squeak," the silence around the dining table was shattered. The sound was so loud and sharp that I was startled, and my eyes involuntarily shot towards my cousin, who resembled Xi Shi, sitting across from me. It was truly unbelievable that my sickly cousin could make such a robust sound. Examining her face, I saw her eyebrows were furrowed in anger, and her gaze was fiercely directed at the maid. The maid stared blankly, just as clueless as I was. After a long while, she asked softly, "Miss, what is it?"

"What?" My cousin quickly pushed the half-eaten bowl of white rice across the table.

My aunt and the maid's eyes were simultaneously drawn to the bowl of rice. After a moment, my aunt said, "Cui Ying, take that bowl of rice and throw it away."

So, the maid, Cui Ying, slowly lowered her eyelids with a dejected look and took the bowl of rice out of the dining room, while I remained completely in the dark.

In the blink of an eye, Cui Ying returned with an empty bowl. The rice pot was on a small table nearby. I saw Cui Ying preparing to serve rice for the young lady again.

My cousin's anger hadn't subsided. When Cui Ying handed her the bowl of rice, she said, "Go get me another empty bowl!"

Cui Ying ran to the kitchen and brought back an empty bowl. My cousin is a rare commodity; I don't know what she wants an empty bowl for. While stuffing my second bowl of rice into my mouth, I secretly watched what tricks my cousin was going to conjure up in that empty bowl.

My cousin used her ivory chopsticks, with her orchid fingers gracefully poised, she counted the rice grains, transferring them one by one from the full bowl to the empty bowl. As she counted, she suddenly lashed out at Cui Ying, "Don't you know anything? What do you do all day?"

Before she could finish speaking, my second bowl of rice was gone. As soon as I stood up, my aunt hurriedly called out, "Cui Ying, serve rice, serve rice." So, I temporarily relieved Cui Ying from her embarrassment.

But after serving the rice, Cui Ying was still called over by my cousin. "Look! The last bowl was full of rat droppings, and this one is full of pebbles. Did you even wash the rice? If I eat the pebbles, I'll get appendicitis. Who will be responsible? Rat droppings are the most unhygienic. It's disgusting! This bowl of rice is fit for you to eat!"

At that moment, my aunt pushed back her chair.

I asked, "Aunt, are you finished eating?"

"Well, my appetite isn't very good. Eating one and a half bowls is already more than usual."

After my aunt finished eating, my cousin also stood up and said, "I can't eat anymore either. Thinking about the rat droppings makes me want to throw up yesterday's meal!"

But I was different: Firstly, I was a guest, and if I didn't eat a few more bowls of rice, my aunt might think I disliked their dishes; secondly, my stomach was bigger than theirs, and I had just said a lot of things, which emptied my stomach. My cousin not only didn't talk but also sat on the sofa eating cakes and biscuits... so I originally wanted to eat four bowls, but since my aunt and cousin were both finished, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to stubbornly stay at the table alone. So, I sped up my pace and ate my third bowl and called it quits.

After the meal, I persistently talked to my aunt about eating bran and starving to death, hoping to persuade her to use her wealth-making hand, but my aunt pressed her money bag tighter and tighter. In the end, I concluded that I was powerless. So, I left, preparing to find my uncle and see if he had any solutions.

(7) A Cross Drawn on His Face

His sudden resistance surprised Ji Zhaoxiong, but he himself couldn't soften as a result.

"Alright, Boss Wu, your affairs are in my hands. Don't regret it later!" Thinking this, he turned around, pretending to leave immediately, but hoping that Qiu Haitang would perhaps figure it out himself and immediately reach out to stop him.

"I have nothing to regret!" Unexpectedly, Qiu Haitang was determined not to give him any face, his tone just as firm to the end. Thus, Ji Zhaoxiong couldn't back down and had to harden his heart and walk out without looking back.

With him gone, Qiu Haitang naturally lost the desire to read the newspaper. He really wished he could go inside immediately to discuss it with Xiang Qi; however, Yuan Baofan was here, how could he possibly talk to Xiang Qi? But the situation was clearly very tense, and if he didn't take precautions, Ji Zhaoxiong might resort to dirty tricks, and it would be too late to avoid the consequences.

"I should talk to Yu Kun first!" He hastily put on a white Indian silk robe and quickly slipped out of the Yuan's house without even taking a straw hat.

Since the birth of Xiang Qi's daughter, Yu Kun, relying on his own cleverness and Qiu Haitang's money, secretly bought a newborn boy and switched him for the girl; he also handled everything about finding a house and hiring a wet nurse. From then on, he continued to use the stage name "Grasshopper," performing in Tianjin for long periods. In the past two or three years, he secretly helped Qiu Haitang and Luo Xiang Qi countless times. The fact that Ji Zhaoxiong couldn't find their secret hideout was largely due to Zhao Yu Kun's involvement.

Up until now, he himself was still single, living year-round in a small public house in the French Concession, leading a very eccentric life: besides a narrow wooden bed that wasn't even three feet wide and a chest of clothes with four broken corners, the room was completely empty. (88)

### Natural

— Jue Hui

The world encompasses everything, but its divisions are very clear: yes or no.

Of course, yes is yes; when no, then no, that is also natural. If yes is treated as no, or no is treated as yes, it is contrary behavior.

To listen to nature is to ignore it; to sigh at what is not natural is to form passive criticism; to complain that it is futile leads to discouragement; to resent that it is not natural can only be left to fate!

To know that it is so, but not know why it is so, is foolish; to know that it is so, and also know why it is so... even the clever are not only that.

To be a model for the masses, to be a true sage, one must act naturally and righteously, for truth does not allow for going against the grain!

To be able to transform the natural, to create the constant, and to conform to the inevitable, that is the natural! There is no need for anything else.

### My Wife is a "New Woman"

— Ju

It's been two months since the wedding, time to write down some impressions of "her."

Of course, she is a modern woman. No, she says the word "modern" has a derogatory meaning, and she should be called a woman of the new era. "New Era," what a beautiful term! Oily, electric-waved hair, face covered in Three Flowers face powder, fingernails with crimson henna, "to-to" sound of leather shoes, and, and, finding a name really took some time!

The first day after the wedding, she asked me how much profit my company made. I told her the truth. "Oh! Is it that little?" She stared at me in surprise, "Then how will we maintain our life?" This question left me speechless. She had to cheerfully look at herself in the mirror and evenly apply her rouge.

If someone thinks that we still maintain silence between us because of unfamiliarity, that is a misunderstanding. Once, when I asked her to wash my handkerchief, she bluntly said: "Do you treat me like a slave? Do you still think this is the feudal era? Women are not the private property of men anymore. This is the civilized era, men and women are equally free and equal, you know?"

Her "justified" answer left me dumbfounded; I was wrong, I shouldn't use the rights of a "husband" to oppress a "new woman"; I restricted her freedom, I overturned mutual equality. "This is the civilized era, and old traditions are outdated. Women shouldn't serve men, just as men don't serve women."

I was wrong, I even begged her forgiveness as if carrying thorns on my back. However, under the "new" shroud, what am I worth? I only have the qualification to "not speak," I only have to silently suffer the consequences of my own actions. She sneered: "You don't like watching movies, you can't play cards, dance, smoke, or entertain guests, you can't do anything, you're not fit to live in this era, you're not a person who goes to big events!"

"Am I not living in the 20th century?" I shifted my gaze to books and pondered with my eyes closed. "I am definitely not outdated, I am not a residue of old-fashioned thinking, precisely because I have received seventeen years of modern education."

I also became confident. Because I have been influenced by the new era and nurtured by civilization, I am somewhat more knowledgeable than her. I am no longer distressed because I have also developed a contemptuous attitude towards her superficial understanding of the "new woman."

I must fight, I must correct her understanding.

I will use all my strength to give my wife another model of a "new woman."

### Discussing the Adaptation of "Crossroads"

— Sha Wei

A Visit with "Second Monster" Lu Si

It is well known that the film "Crossroads" is being adapted into a stage play by the Tianfeng Drama Troupe. In order to learn the details of the adaptation, I visited Mr. Lu Si Te, the adapter of the play, the next day. Upon meeting him, I couldn't help but laugh. Why? Well, his hair was so long it looked like it hadn't been cut for four months. If it weren't daytime, people who didn't know him might have thought Song Danping from "Midnight Song" had been resurrected! Monster! Monster! The "Second Monster" after Shen Siling, his reputation is well deserved. After exchanging pleasantries, I formally raised the question.

Reporter: I heard that "Crossroads" has been completely finished. Can you tell me some details about the adaptation?

Lu Si: Before I started the adaptation, the entire play in my mind's stage was originally divided into three acts; however, when I officially started writing, I felt difficulties because the film "Crossroads" left me with too much material. Three acts simply couldn't accommodate it, so now it has been changed to four acts. The first act introduces the characters of the whole play, writing about the bitterness of youth unemployment; the second act narrates Lao Zhao's hard work after getting a job, and the big quarrel between the front and back buildings caused by An's revenge on the landlady, and his unexpected romantic encounters; the third act tells about Lao Zhao and Yang Zhiying's coincidental encounter in the park, and also narrates the reasons for Big Brother Liu's departure from Shanghai and the factory's bankruptcy; the fourth act writes about Lao Zhao's "getting love" and "losing his job," and finally learns a lesson from reality and gains understanding from his actions.

Reporter: Is the adapted stage script completely faithful to Xi Ling's film legacy?

Lu Si: The main thing is to be faithful to the original. However, this is common sense: film, under the control of the director's will, captures individual fragments, which are then edited and compiled to establish a kind of film time and space, but there is a great difference between this and real time and space. And the use of this cinematic technique of focusing on time and space is not possible on the stage. Therefore, the adapted stage script differs slightly from the original in these places (time and place). In addition, I wanted to make "Crossroads" more effective here and now, so I changed the era in which the play takes place and moved it to the present day after the war. In this way, the reasons for the factory's bankruptcy and Lao Zhao's unemployment, etc., must of course be given a different explanation from the original.

Reporter: Can I know your self-criticism of the adapted version of the play?

Lu Si: In a word: "Very bad"! — Please give a lot of guidance during the performance!

Reporter: You're too kind. Then will you participate in the rehearsals?

Lu Si: No. I have absolute trust in the director of this play, Mr. Wu Chen, who has a very deep study and understanding of drama.

Talking about this, I bid farewell and came out.

### Drama News

— Jue Xin

After Gou Huisheng's performance on the New Stage, Zhang Yipeng is taking a temporary break. Yesterday, the reporter visited him. Recently, because his father, Zhang Yingjie (i.e., Gai Jiaotian), is seriously ill, and his beloved wife, Han Suqiu, is also unwell and has not fully recovered, he is not in a good mood; however, his daily practice, vocal exercises, and playwriting work are still not interrupted.

According to him, he plans to adapt the play "Iron Rooster," renaming it "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." He wants to write Zhang Jiaxiang as a character completely different from the characters he currently plays. His surrender to the Xiang commander is completely fake. He tries to assassinate him several times, but is unable to get close. Later, Chen Xiangrui discovers his actions and allows him to be executed. This is a rough outline of the whole play. After he adapts it, he feels that it will be more meaningful.

Ma Junnan Kun, a famous amateur opera singer in Shanghai, is the eldest son of Mr. Ma Jinqing, a giant in the jewelry industry. He was taught by the famous teacher Liu Bilin and is skilled in many operas. He is usually enthusiastic about charitable causes. Last night, he performed "Lianhuan Tao" at the Golden Theater to raise funds for the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, with his teacher Liu Bilin playing the qin for him.

### James Roosevelt's Path into Film

— New Film

James Roosevelt, the eldest son of the American White House owner Roosevelt, now lives in Hollywood and is also a film worker. But recently, news came that he was following his father's wishes for a trip to China. Therefore, I will write about James Roosevelt's path into film.

Early Childhood

James is Roosevelt's eldest son, serious and hardworking except during rest. From an early age, he inherited his father's upbringing. If he likes political life, he will definitely have considerable achievements in the future. At the age of twenty, he looks very experienced, and some people think he is more than that age. His thinking is rich and correct. He has a talent for speaking, and on the radio, he is often mistaken for his father.

Abandoning Politics for Film

James Roosevelt has always had a good impression of the film industry. Since the year before last, he has abandoned political life and concentrated on the film industry in Hollywood. It's strange that he is unwilling to take on military duties in the government but likes to be an executive in a film company. Since joining United Artists, he has concentrated his lifelong energy on the film industry. Therefore, in the past three years, he has made considerable contributions to the Hollywood film industry.

Announcing Engagement

Recently, news came that James Roosevelt and Ms. Romance Chet announced their engagement on April 15. Ms. Chet is a female caregiver. After a considerable period of friendship, they officially got engaged and obtained a marriage license from the authorities in advance. It is noted that James officially divorced his ex-wife, Miss Betsy Cushing, on March 7, 1940, and only found his current lover after being a widower for a year.

Departing for China

After his engagement, James Roosevelt left San Francisco on April 19, taking a clipper ship east to the wartime capital of Chongqing, with a slight delay in Cairo along the way. The only purpose of Mr. Luo's trip to China is to carry on his father's wishes and promote Sino-American relations. After arriving in Chongqing, in addition to some important matters to discuss with the Chinese authorities, he will also go to various places in the interior to visit battle sites and observe the progress of wartime construction in China. Another piece of news said that after Mr. Luo, there will be several other people from the United States coming to China to conduct investigations.

### Recent News from the Film City

— Bertha

"The Philadelphia Story" is Zhen Shanlin Hepburn's first work returning to the film industry. According to general reviews, the film can be listed as one of the best comedies of the year, because not only is Catherine's performance excellent, but James Stewart and Cary Grant are also successful. Now, Catherine has become the goal of all film companies, and they all want to sign contracts with her, but her intention is to return to the Broadway stage at least one more time.

Milan Lona has been very close to Lin Daini'er recently, and they may get engaged before this summer.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Shuo Mingdao

Chapter 7: Attacking Cities and Killing Generals in a Chaotic Battle

Li Xinyang brandished his knife and cursed at the magistrate of Qi County, "I have no grudges against you, and I kindly helped you defend the city. Unfortunately, I failed, and I wanted to escape and return home to be a good citizen. You, however, listened to the words of villains, slandered me arbitrarily, and wanted to put me to death as quickly as possible. Your cruelty is extreme. Who knew that my life should not end, and you would have a day to be caught in my grasp? Where do you think you can escape to?" The magistrate of Qi County could only beg for mercy, "Lord Li, please spare me. Take the gold and silver in my cabinet to atone for my sins." The beloved concubine also begged Hong Niangzi bitterly. Li Xin laughed loudly and said, "Dog official, I knew you were accustomed to abuse your power and scrape the people's fat, accumulating a lot of sinful money. The people of Qi County have suffered deeply! Do you want to use this gold and silver to atone for your sins today? It's useless! Not only will you lose everything you own, but you will also lose your life, so that all greedy officials in the world will know what to be warned of." Li Xin spoke eloquently, but Hong Niangzi became impatient waiting by the side, so she said to Li Xin, "Hurry up and do it! We still have to go out of the city to meet my brother. The country is being ruined by these greedy villains. Do they even deserve to be taught a lesson?" Li Xin smiled and said, "That's right." With a wave of the knife in his hand, there was only a snap, and a bloody human head rolled aside. The corpse of the magistrate of Qi County fell to the ground, and he could no longer care about his beloved concubine or gold. The beloved concubine saw Li Xin kill someone and was so frightened that she screamed for help. Hong Niangzi sneered and said, "You slut, I'll send you to be with him." She thrust her sword straight into her heart, and blood splattered everywhere, and she also fell to the ground and died. The jewelry box in her hand fell to the ground with a thud. Hong Niangzi opened the box and saw that it was full of bright pearls and gems, and she laughed, "Let me take it back. Consider it a reward for coming to Qi County again." Li Xin pointed the knife at the gold and silver in the cabinet and said to Hong Niangzi, "What should we do with this dirty money?" Hong Niangzi said, "These are all ill-gotten gains. We might as well have the boys move it back to the mountain to reward them." At this time, several of the boys from Qing Shishan were following the killings, so Hong Niangzi ordered that all the gold and silver in the cabinet be transported back to the Qing Shishan area.
