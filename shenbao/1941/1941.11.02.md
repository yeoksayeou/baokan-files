After the Fujian Provincial Trading Company successively cut back the three parts of its business - timber import and native produce export (namely Heji Trading Company) - in April and May of this year, there are still four departments: Xuan paper industry, candy, tea, and matches. Recently, due to the central government's implementation of a monopoly on sugar, tea, and firewood, it was decided to further reduce the scope. The paper, sugar, and tea departments will be closed by the end of November. The match department can continue to operate this year because the central monopoly agency has not yet been established. In the future, the company's business will, in addition to complying with the provincial-operated trade supervision rules promulgated by the central government, operate all daily necessities, and regulate the supply and demand of materials to curb the skyrocketing prices.

Ambassador Gu then expressed gratitude on behalf of the Chinese people, stating that this donation represents the donors' sympathy for China, and at the same time has the significance of reducing the suffering of people in China, and symbolizes the unity of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union in their common struggle.

The "New York Voice Forum" stated today that American political circles generally believe that US-Japan relations will become more acute within two weeks, that is, on the 15th of this month, when the new Japanese cabinet will announce its foreign policy. Because US-Japan negotiations have now been shelved, if either side initiates, it is still possible to resume negotiations.

The New York Times also carried a dispatch from Washington stating that the United States cannot make concessions to Japan and that Japan must change its attitude.

The new Tojo cabinet has expressed its firm determination to eliminate the vague atmosphere surrounding the Washington conference. If the United States wants to prevent a Pacific war and ensure the supply of rubber and tin from India and Malaya, on which its industry depends, then the United States should carefully consider Japan's firm determination and the timing of its request has arrived. This request is made for self-defense and aims to protect the survival of the country. The newspaper also stated in an article that US-Japan relations are currently on the edge of a precipice, and a slight carelessness can lead to a tragic disaster for both countries. The most important economic issue between the two countries is the oil supply. If Japan cannot transport oil from the United States, it must find a way to obtain it, even at the risk of danger.

China and the United States Cooperate Closely in Military and Economic Aspects; Chinese Base Areas Are Willing to Provide Wartime Use to the United States; Song Ziwen and Roosevelt Hold Important Talks

　　合衆社一日重慶電
United Press Dispatch, Chongqing, 1st

A certain senior Chinese official told a United Press reporter today that although China has not received any recommendations from Washington regarding a broad program for the post-war reconstruction of the international economy, China will absolutely cooperate with this matter. He also said that Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi exchanged letters with U.S. Secretary of State Hull in Washington, discussing general trade issues between countries, and that the "Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration" has also been officially sponsored by the Chinese government. He also said that China agrees with this program, which has nothing to do with the Lend-Lease Act. China's hopes for the post-war period are the same as those announced, so there is no need to use Lend-Lease aid as bait to obtain China's cooperation. At the same time, the official did not comment on the news that China and the United States have an agreement allowing the United States to use Chinese base areas, but many believe that China and the United States have an "unwritten" arrangement. Once the United States and Japan go to war, China will provide base areas for the United States to use. Well-informed political figures said that this arrangement has been completed long ago because the United States has this need in its naval and air combat strategy. The official "Central Daily News" had previously publicly made this suggestion to the United States, saying that China would provide base areas for the United States to use in the event of a conflict between the United States and Japan. Well-informed sources said that this matter is purely a wartime measure and will not continue after the war as the Japanese claim. The reaction here to the editorial in "Nippon Kōchi Shimpō" regarding the accusation that the United States is using "China as collateral" is generally that "it is extremely foolish and has no value for criticism." Minister of Military Administration General He Yingqin told a United Press reporter in early summer of this year that China would be happy to provide any air force base for the United States to use completely during the US-Japan war. Chinese people believe that they now recognize the United States as China's actual ally, so once the United States and Japan go to war, China and the United States will naturally become absolute allies, and it is natural for China to provide base areas for the United States to use. As for the post-war period, China has not suggested that the base areas be provided for the permanent use of the United States. He also said, "This is the reason why we are fighting against Japan. We will not allow it to establish base areas on Chinese territory forever." Chinese officials here also condemned the Japanese claims that General Magruder or Mr. Lattimore are "bargaining" with the Chinese side.

According to the Japanese side, the United States' request is an exchange for considering Lend-Lease aid to China. (Chongqing also denies this matter, but points out that China has previously stated that if the United States goes to war with Japan, China is willing to provide these base areas for the United States to use.)

Mr. Ma replied to the welcoming remarks at the reception of the Sino-American Cultural Association, "I have come to Chongqing after a long journey, and it is very worthwhile to hear such complimentary remarks about the military. I would like to ask this slightly sarcastic reporter to note that he has listed us among the cultural figures. The delegation is currently scattered in Washington, the two coasts, the Pacific, Hong Kong, Lashio, and Rangoon, but we will all come here. One of the characteristics of the delegation is that we have no secrets. My first public appearance may clarify the purpose of our delegation, which is to assist China in fighting aggression. Everything we do will be for this purpose, and we will do our best to do it." Minister of Education Chen Lifu delivered a speech, welcoming the delegation, saying, "China currently has two slogans, namely 'Military First' and 'Do Everything to Achieve Victory.' Our guests tonight are here to help us achieve victory, so their arrival here is more important than the arrival of the guests we have hosted before." Chen asked, "How can the Pacific be peaceful if the enemies of peace and freedom are not destroyed?" He said that the culture and civilization of the new world must be based on the principles of peace and freedom, and should be jointly undertaken by China and the Soviet Union to defeat the public enemies who violate these principles. Chen also said, "Culture has three aspects, namely education, military, and economy, among which the military is the most important, because the progress of the other two depends on the guarantee of the military. This is our first opportunity to host the representatives of the military aspect of culture." Finally, Chen raised his glass to wish the U.S. President well.

United States Expresses Indignation at the Sinking of Destroyer; President Roosevelt Says Relations with Germany Will Not Change Due to This Incident

　　合衆社一日華盛頓電
United Press Dispatch, Washington, 1st

Amid the tide of congressional condemnation of Germany for sinking the U.S. destroyer "Rubin James" west of Iceland, President Roosevelt yesterday refused to criticize what he said to outsiders that the result of this sinking might lead to a breakdown of U.S. relations. President Roosevelt told the press that from the U.S. point of view, the international situation did not change due to the "Rubin James" incident. President Roosevelt said that the ship was only carrying out its mission when it was sunk, and said that he had nothing more to announce other than the Navy's statement. The Navy Department said that the destroyer was sunk while escorting, and it was the first U.S. warship lost since the outbreak of the European war. The Navy said that there were no other details after this. President Roosevelt refused to discuss the fact that U.S. warships had sunk one or more Swedish submarines while the U.S. Navy was gradually increasing its participation in the war in the Atlantic. President Roosevelt said that he would not reveal it even if he knew it, and pointed out that this kind of information must be kept secret from Germany, because it will cause anxiety and lead to war. The first result of this sinking is that the Senate will soon pass the Neutrality Act amendment, allowing U.S. merchant ships to be armed. There is no doubt that this bill will be passed soon, because the administration has 46 votes in favor of this bill. Some speculate that U.S. public opinion may demand that the United States sever diplomatic relations with Germany to retaliate for this sinking and force the United States to the brink of war with Germany. The "Rubin James" was the first warship sunk after President Roosevelt ordered the Navy to "shoot on sight" at any Axis pirate ships entering U.S. defensive waters. The Navy Department said that the Navy Department did not know whether there were any casualties. Well-informed sources said that U.S. warships and aircraft had or were engaged in a large-scale search for the submarine. They pointed out that even if the warships and aircraft had found and sunk the submarine, the Navy Department would not announce it. The Navy Department issued a brief communique, without specifying the nationality of the submarine that sank the "Rubin James", but well-informed sources here said that they believed it was sunk by a Nazi submarine. Well-informed sources said that the "Rubin James" was apparently torpedoed near the location where two previous U.S. destroyers were sunk.

United Press Dispatch, London, 1st

British senior authorities yesterday condemned the sinking of the U.S. warship "Rubin James" and warned that this act was tantamount to Germany waging naval warfare against the United States. It is said that "The sinking of the 'Rubin James' is a maritime war by Germany against the United States. The German side's goal is to prevent U.S. goods from being transported to Britain, because these goods will enable Britain to win." British people all believe that the attack on the "Rubin James" is the worst in the war, and believe that this matter will make U.S. opinion have the possibility of revival. It is expected that the official will not make any criticism of this matter, because this incident is regarded as only related to the United States and Germany. Unofficial British people all hope that this incident can enable the United States to pass the expanded amendment to the Neutrality Act as soon as possible, allowing U.S. merchant ships to be armed and enter war zones, or completely abolish the Neutrality Act. The initial reaction of some British people was "We hope that we can sink this bloodthirsty robber, or take other better steps than the United States has taken." It is generally believed here that if the United States participates in the war, there must be other events larger than the sinking of a destroyer while escorting. However, most British people believe that there will eventually be a day when this event will happen that will cause the United States to participate in the war.

This morning, the morning newspapers prominently published the news of the sinking of the U.S. warship "Rubin James", and most focused on President Roosevelt's statement that U.S.-German relations will not change. The New York correspondents of the "Daily Mail" and "Daily Express" said that the United States has now taken the last "step" towards declaring war. The sinking of the "Rubin James" has shocked the entire country. U.S. congressmen and the press have called out loudly, saying that this is a fatal blow to national honor, and warned that if there is no retaliation, the United States will be regarded as a great shame by the world. An editorial in the "Daily Telegraph" declared, "This is a challenge to the American people and the American Navy. The American Navy must know how to answer it." The editorial briefly stated that "Nazism has decided on the path of destruction."

It was announced here last night that forty-four crew members of the sunk U.S. warship "Rubin James" have been rescued. The ship usually carries 120 people. Although the simple announcement did not mention the survival of other crew members, it is generally believed that they have all been lost.

　　合衆社一日華盛頓電

The hope for the 77 crew members of the "Rubin James" has rapidly decreased, but it has not been completely abandoned. Captain Edwards and six of his officers are also among these 77 people. However, waiting ships and aircraft are still continuing to search for other crew members in the North Pacific. At the same time, this question has not been received from the U.S. Navy since receiving President Roosevelt's shooting order. The U.S. Navy has never sunk any submarines. The President and Secretary of the Navy Knox both expressed their disapproval of announcing the sinking, because the uncertainty of the fate of the German submarines would lower the morale of the German naval personnel. Naval officials pointed out that in the previous world war, the United States lost only one destroyer, the "Jacob Jones", which was sunk by German famous submarine commander Luchs in the English Channel. Luchs towed the destroyer's lifeboats and used wireless radio to inform the British Navy of the location of the rescued Americans.

Senator McCuller said that Secretary Knox will take the best steps for the defense of the United States in the shortest possible time. Mr. Mai continued to say, "There is no doubt that Japan will participate in the war. Although Japan has a navy, it is not as strong as our country. I believe that Japan is not willing to have its navy destroyed." He forked out, "Indeed, Japan is very willing to join the war, but once this fact is implemented, it will be very unfavorable to Japan.

社評歐亞軸心的同床異夢
Editorial: The uneasy alliance of the European-Asian Axis

Germany, relying on its recent slight advantage in the war against the Soviet Union, has continued to provoke the United States in the Atlantic. Not long after the Colep incident, the US destroyer "Rubin James" was brazenly sunk by the Germans. This kind of action, if not accidental, undoubtedly has the direct intention of hindering Washington's aid to Britain and the Soviet Union. It also wants to force the United States to formally join the war, so as to indirectly encourage Japan to carry out its expansion plan in the Pacific. As far as Germany is concerned, it seems to have greater confidence in dealing with the Soviet Union alone. Its hidden worry is that Britain and the United States are becoming more and more prepared. In the future, there will be a day when Hitler will still have to deal with the war on both the eastern and western fronts alone at the most unfavorable time and environment. Therefore, instead of waiting for Britain to be fully replenished and the United States to expand its army to a satisfactory level, and then fighting on the western front, it is better to strike first, so that the United States has to go to war ahead of time. In this way, on the one hand, it takes advantage of the time, and on the other hand, it can use Japan's expansion ambitions and isolated situation to encourage it to fulfill its obligation to contain British and American forces in the East for Germany. In other words, what Hitler hopes for from Tojo today is that the military prime minister

Long Drought and Dry Air: Two Fires Yesterday; Paint Factory Fire Destroys Over 30 Buildings; Child's Body Found in Cloud Dance Hall Fire

Recently, the weather in this city has been clear and the air very dry. According to the records of the Da Wen Tai, on the 30th, the humidity was only 54.7% to 64.4%, and on the 31st, it was 48.2% to 60.4%. This not only affects the health of residents but also easily leads to fires.

Wu Liangcai Dormitory

Yesterday, the weather was sunny. Around 11 AM, a sudden fire broke out in the four-story staff dormitory of Wu Liangcai Glasses Company at No. 297 Paobulu, Public Concession. The fire quickly spread. The Central Fire Brigade received the news and rushed to the scene. It took an hour to extinguish the fire. The fourth floor was completely destroyed, and the lower floors were also slightly affected. The storefront was also damaged by water. Because the location was in a busy area, traffic was cut off. Traffic was restored after the fire was extinguished.

Shanghai Paint Factory

Around 1:30 AM yesterday, a fire broke out at the Shanghai Paint Factory at No. 209, Haige Road, Hongqiao Road, Xuhui. Flames quickly shot through the roof. The fire was extinguished by the fire brigade around 2 AM. The entire paint factory was destroyed, and the fire spread to more than 30 neighboring buildings, including Dafeng Enamel Factory, Taichang Rice Store, Yecheng Wine Store, and Huafeng Machinery Factory. The losses were estimated to be in the millions. A male resident was severely burned while escaping from the fire and was sent to the hospital for treatment.

Child Burned to Death

The day before yesterday (the 31st), a sudden fire broke out in the New Capital Hotel on the sixth floor of the New New Company on Nanjing Road, causing significant losses. In addition to the Cloud Dance Hall being affected and seeking compensation for damages, it was learned that yesterday morning, firefighters found the body of an 11 or 12-year-old child in the debris of the Cloud Dance Hall. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. It was reported that the child was a doorman named Yu from the Cloud Dance Hall.

Two Gunshots on Rue Édouard VII Yesterday

Yesterday at 11:30 AM, two gunshots were suddenly heard at the intersection of Rue Édouard VII and Rue Chu Pao San, French Concession. Fortunately, no one was injured. It was reported that six armed soldiers of an unidentified country, carrying various weapons, including some with sabers, entered the French Concession from the Old North Gate of the Nanshi through the iron gate, proceeded north on Rue de l'Ancienne Porte du Nord to Rue Édouard VII, turned east, and walked along Rue Édouard VII to No. 10 Rue Chu Pao San, in front of Ncwritz Bar. Two of the six soldiers each pulled out a pistol and fired a shot into the ground for no reason. Fortunately, no one was injured, and only two bullet holes were left in the ground. Nearby police officers heard the gunshots and rushed to investigate. The shooters had already calmly put away their guns and headed east towards the Bund. At that time, cars traveling east and west on Rue Édouard VII, as well as Chinese and foreign employees of companies and foreign firms on both sides of the north and south, were shocked and bewildered by the gunshots. Afterwards, the relevant McLane Police Station also sent detectives to the scene to investigate the truth.

Xin Pu Yu Tang Emphasizes Both Teaching and Care; Excellent Results This Year; Continued Assistance from All Sectors Needed

Xin Pu Yu Tang in Nanshi is a well-known Catholic charity that includes an infant home, an orphanage, a nursing home, and a hospital for the disabled. It provides appropriate education and care to more than a thousand poor, sick, elderly, and disabled people. The management is thorough and the facilities are perfect. It has saved countless lives for more than a decade.

This Year's Work

The hospital recently issued the following statistics on the number of people received from January 1st to the end of October this year: At the end of the 29th year, there were a total of 955 people in care, including 146 elderly people, 96 disabled people, 355 orphans, 253 patients, and 105 unemployed refugees. From January to October of the 30th year, a total of 583 new people were received, including 93 elderly people, 23 disabled people, 48 orphans, and 419 patients. From January 1st to the end of October of the 30th year, 181 people were discharged from the hospital, and 286 people died. As of the end of October, there were 1,071 people in care, 65 infants were fostered out, 12 orphans were sent to school, and 6 orphaned girls were married off. The total number of daily consultations and medications administered in ten months was 44,570. The number of female students attending the free school was 120.

Hope for Donations of Clothing and Money

Due to soaring prices and increased expenses, Xin Pu Yu Tang has appealed to enthusiastic people in society for assistance and has received widespread sympathy, with donations pouring in (the titles of donors in September and October can be found in the thank-you advertisement on the front page of today's newspaper). However, continued assistance is still needed to ensure that the care of more than a thousand people in need is not interrupted. Donations of clothing and money are welcome. Clothing can be sent to the Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street, and donations can be sent to Jihua Pharmacy on Yunnan Road, Jiao Ma Road Huamei Pharmacy, and the Silk Industry Bank on San Ma Road.

British Troops Will Land in Western Europe Soon After Sufficient Mechanical Equipment is Deployed: Broadcast by the British Embassy Information Office

Mr. Mole of the British Embassy Information Office broadcasted on the Democratic Radio Station, stating that Moscow is still in the hands of the Soviet army and will not fall into German hands for a considerable period. This is crucial because the Soviet army will not retreat easily from the Nazi attacks without exacting a heavy price, preventing the Nazis from boasting about conquering it for the time being. Germany urgently needs to occupy Moscow in terms of the current overall strategy and situation, but it has suffered 3 million casualties and countless losses of military equipment, and its true effect has not been achieved at all. Another issue that must be raised is that there is a very popular saying in Shanghai that the British are letting the Soviet Union and other unfortunate people fall into suffering without landing on the west coast of Europe. This is a serious misunderstanding. Britain has long been determined to do so, but it still takes time to re-equip its military equipment after the Dunkirk battle. The current war is entirely a mechanical war, and it is difficult to be sure of victory without sufficient equipment. Therefore, Britain can only provide assistance to the Soviet Union for the time being, and the British army must be fully prepared before launching a fatal blow to the Nazis.

Rong Wu Society's 23rd Lecture: Promoting the Doctrine of Education for All

At the 23rd lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Lecture Society, Mr. Shen Jueling spoke about the Confucian responsibility to harmonize the five teachings by exemplifying the Confucian ideal of education for all. In the third section, he stated that Confucian scholars who read the Confucian classics and receive the Confucian teaching of education for all, and who are familiar with the principles of the Doctrine of the Mean that all things are nourished together without harming each other and that ways run parallel without contradicting each other, have long been rich in harmony. Now, let us try to trace the origin of the Confucian way of using moderation and harmony. In the Zilu chapter of the Analects, "The Master said, 'If I cannot get men who follow the due medium, to whom shall I resort? Shall I not resort to the impetuous and the cautiously decided? The impetuous advance and grasp; the cautiously decided do not do what they know to be wrong.'" It is indeed possible to harmonize advancement and doing what is slightly wrong, which can be called the due medium. This still concerns individuality. If we extend it to doctrines, in the Jin Xin chapter of Mencius, "Mencius said, 'Yang Zhu would not pluck out one hair to benefit the world. Mozi would benefit the world by rubbing himself from head to heel.'" These all describe their extremes. It is indeed possible to harmonize selfishness and universal love, which can be called the Doctrine of the Mean.

Examination of Christianity's Entry into China

Therefore, in the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu, who initiated the revival of Confucianism after eight generations, used literature to reveal the Way, which can be called virtuous. However, in his "On the Way," he criticized Lao Tzu and Buddha, saying that the Way they spoke of was not the Way he spoke of, and the virtue they valued was not the virtue he valued. Although Han Yu claimed that there was no Confucius in the world and that he should not be ranked among the disciples, his learning had not yet reached the greatness of Confucius. In the Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi, based on the teachings of the Cheng brothers, extracted the two chapters "Doctrine of the Mean" and "Great Learning" from the Book of Rites and combined the Analects and Mencius to form the Four Books, writing commentaries and annotations for them, which can be called great virtue. However, in the thirteenth chapter of "Reflections at Hand," "Distinguishing Heterodoxy," he quoted Mingdao's words, saying that Buddhism and Taoism were close to reason but more harmful than Yang Zhu and Mozi. Although Cheng Zhu's philosophy occupies an important position in history, their Way had not yet reached the greatness of Confucius. How bitter were Lu Jiuyuan's words, "There is a sage in the East Sea, this mind, this principle is the same; there is a sage in the West Sea, this mind, this principle is the same." His words can be said to have seen its greatness.

Next, Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on "Examination of the Transmission of Christianity into China," saying: When did Christianity enter China? Even people in the religion are vague. Some say that "during the Eastern Han Dynasty, two Syrian Christians came to learn silk weaving, with the aim of spreading the gospel." "A Complete Record of the Reformation of Luther" states, "In the 34th year after Christ, when Ma Yuan conquered Jiaozhi, Jews came to China to avoid the massacre in Babylon." "A Brief History of the Opening of Churches in Yanjing" states, "In the 65th year, Nero massacred Christians; in the 69th year, Jerusalem was destroyed, and Christians came east." (To be continued)

Grand Stamp Exhibition to Be Held in This City

The Xinguang Stamp Society is a purely academic organization that was established in the 15th year of the Republic of China. Its members are all over the country and abroad. This year marks the 15th anniversary of its founding. The society is organizing a stamp exhibition from the 3rd to the 7th of November at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road, inviting famous philatelists from China and abroad to display their precious collections of Chinese and foreign stamps for the observation of fellow enthusiasts. The Shanghai Postal Administration will also sponsor the event by setting up a temporary post office on-site to collect and mail items, and to stamp the envelopes with a commemorative postmark. The aim is to increase public awareness of stamp collecting. It is said that the exhibits at this exhibition will include complete collections of rare and valuable stamps from five countries, and the most valuable "Red Revenue Stamp, Small Characters, One Yuan" stamp will be displayed in both new and used condition, which is truly remarkable. There are three types of admission tickets: A. Honorary Sponsor Tickets, priced at ten yuan each, allowing admission at any time during the exhibition period; B. Ordinary Admission Tickets, priced at two yuan each, for single use; C. Member Admission Tickets, priced at one yuan each. Tickets can be pre-purchased at various stamp companies and at the stationery department of Wing On Company.

No News of Zhu Xiangrong Since Abduction

Zhu Xiangrong, manager of Xincheng Trading Company on Rue Édouard VII, has been missing for seven days since being abducted on the 27th of last month. Mr. Zhu has worked for Mobil Oil for more than 20 years. Since the August 13th Incident, business has declined sharply. However, the commission given by Mobil Oil for gasoline remains the same, causing the Xincheng Company to incur losses day by day, and it has been completely depleted. Plans are underway to close down the Xincheng Company. Although his three sons each have their own jobs, they still rely on their father from time to time. The family burden is extremely heavy. There has been no news since the abduction, and the family's livelihood is precarious and extremely anxious.

Zhang Garden Opened Yesterday

Zhang Garden opened at 10 AM yesterday. At that time, Jingan Road was bustling with traffic and extremely crowded. Hundreds of guests had arrived by 9 AM. After 10 AM, Ms. Zhou Manhua and Mr. Ding Fubao unveiled the opening with applause. Guests rushed in, and the scene was unprecedented. The hotel and tea room are luxuriously decorated, the air is fresh, the dishes are exquisite, and the service is attentive. The theater is decorated in a palace style, and the tickets for the day were sold out in advance.

Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather in Shandong, here, and the East China Sea is cloudy, clear, and rather cold, with strong northwest to northeast winds. The weather around the Ogasawara Islands is bad due to a hurricane moving north-northeast or northeast. The center of the hurricane was within 120 miles of 24 degrees north latitude and 14() degrees east longitude at 6 AM, with the wind direction being north-northeast and the wind force being water-like. Also, within the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 72.5 degrees and the lowest was 49.1 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 77.5 degrees and the lowest was 57.4 degrees.

Yesterday's newspaper was published at 6:40 PM.

Ticket Seller on Tram No. 6 Assaults Passenger; Police Lawyer Expresses Outrage; Defendant Denies Profiteering, Detained for Further Questioning

Ever since Wang Wanxiang, a ticket seller for the tram company, was sentenced to life imprisonment for pushing passenger Xiang Dongchuan to his death after his attempted profiteering failed, and the public opinion severely condemned him, it was hoped that the ticket sellers would deeply repent and reform. Unexpectedly, there are still reports of them relying on their power to insult passengers.

Cause of the Conflict

At 11:55 AM on the 19th of last month, Zang Fugen, a bread deliveryman residing at No. 40 Qingchang Lane, Elgin Road, boarded a No. 6 tram from the North Station to the Bund. The fare was 20 cents. Zang paid the ticket seller No. 1326, Ni Yubiao, one yuan in legal tender. Ni gave him 80 cents in change but did not give him the ticket. When the tram reached the intersection of Hubei Road and Guangdong Road, Zang asked for the ticket. Ni not only refused to give it but also shouted "Injustice," etc., causing a conflict. Ni then violently pushed Zang, causing him to hit his head on the iron gate and get injured. Qin Fusheng, the door opener No. 143 on the tram, aided the evildoer and helped Ni violently beat Zang. Witnesses felt injustice. After investigation by Chinese Constable No. 2079, he immediately reported to the Lao Zha Police Station by telephone and ordered Detective Yin Mengfei and others to rush to the scene.

Injuries in Four Places

At that time, Zang had been injured in many places. The thousand people were taken to the police station, and Zang was sent to the hospital. Examination revealed that his forehead, skull, shoulder, chest, and other parts had been injured. A warrant was requested from the Special First Court, and Judge Zhan Liangce summoned them to the Fifth Criminal Court yesterday. Police lawyer Qian Jiuyi prosecuted them for injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Law, stating that the plaintiff had one injury on his head, which was found to have been caused by Ni Yubiao hitting him with a ticket board. The defendants should respect the passengers who provide them with food and clothing. Instead, they violently assaulted and insulted them, which is extremely hateful and should be severely punished according to the law. However, the plaintiff, Zang Fugen, did not appear due to work reasons. When questioned, Ni Yubiao claimed that the dispute arose because Zang used banknotes (but the banknote was handed over to the police station). He denied profiteering and attributed the plaintiff's injuries to his own carelessness and hitting the iron railing. The judge questioned that if he had only hit the iron gate, there would only be one injury. However, the plaintiff had as many as four or five injuries. How could he attribute them all to self-inflicted injuries? Ni's answers were evasive, while Qin Fusheng claimed that he had only tried to mediate and had not helped in the assault. After reviewing the statements, Judge Zhan ordered a postponement for further questioning.

Firefighter Yu Wenzhao Died in the Line of Duty; Funeral Held Yesterday

After firefighter Yu Wenzhao, No. 5.0, was suffocated by smoke and flames during the fire in Cichang Lane on the 29th and died, his funeral was held at the Paradise Funeral Home yesterday. Qin Bin-yan of the Fire Department of the Public Works Department, representatives from various fire brigades, and hundreds of people from all walks of life attended. The bereaved family, including his wife, children, brothers, and sisters, were overcome with grief. There were many floral wreaths. The Public Works Department military band accompanied the funeral procession, and road sacrifices were held with extreme sorrow.

Public Memorial for Qin Zhonghuan

The Dazhong News Agency was bombed on April 1st of this year, and staff member Qin Dunhuan was injured in the foot. He was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment but was soon transferred to the Yuyuan Sanatorium due to financial constraints. Despite careful treatment, he eventually died on the 18th of this month due to the disease. Colleagues and friends of the news agency held a public memorial service for Qin at Longxing Temple on Rue Édouard VII at 2 PM the day before yesterday, believing that Qin had sacrificed his life for the country. The ceremony was simple and solemn. Qin's portrait was placed on the national flag, surrounded by wreaths. Many relatives, friends, and colleagues attended the memorial service. Important party and government figures sent wreaths, including Wang Shijie, Pan Gongzhan, and Dong Xian Guang ("Sacrificed for the Country"), Xiao Tongzi and Chen Bosheng ("Dedicated to Duty"), Du Yuesheng ("Serving the Country with His Life"), Yu Hongjun ("Eternal Spirit"), the Shanghai Office of the Central News Department, the Shanghai Party Headquarters, and the Shenzhou Daily (a large wreath), the Zhengyan Newspaper and the Zhongmei Daily ("Immortal Soul"), and Pu Qiting ("Eternal Glory"), as well as elegiac couplets from colleagues at the Dazhong News Agency and the Zhengyan Newspaper, all of which highly praised Qin.

Shanghai Prostitutes (3) Translated by Kequn

In Shanghai, it is common to see manuals full of women's photos in every Chinese hotel and restaurant, shown to people for summoning. These women are the so-called "guides." However, although these women are called "guides," they are actually prostitutes in name only. The price for these guide girls is usually one yuan per hour in national currency. For those who are beautiful, the price increases to two yuan per hour. If you want to go further and have a close relationship with them, the cost will be about ten yuan. These women return to their homes with guests or stay in hotels together, all according to the convenience of the customer. I once interviewed a Chinese venereal disease expert, who said that at least 80 percent of these women are sick.

There are also many Turkish baths in Shanghai, and the women there are also prostitutes. A reporter went to a Turkish bath to investigate the content of this type of bath and the massage process. What I saw was a naked woman vigorously scrubbing herself with a dry towel. This woman is a prostitute. In some low-end Turkish baths, customers and the women there can complete their deeds in the bathroom. However, in other higher-end Turkish baths, customers are not allowed to engage in such activities with the masseuses in the bathroom. If they want to fulfill their desires, they must take them to a hotel.

I remember that I once felt unwell and went to this type of bath for a massage. When I arrived, I saw that all the equipment inside was very dirty and unbearable, making people afraid to touch it. Although the women there were wearing white uniforms, the white color had turned earthy due to the dirt. All the towels were also very unclean. I finally dared not use them and left wearing my clothes.

There is another type of disguised prostitute. These women often frequent lower-class coffee shops or bars. These women are called semi-prostitutes (This type of name is similar in nature to the private prostitutes commonly known in our country). These women are all quite beautiful and are frequented by foreigners and Chinese students. If you offer them a drink, it is said that they will get up and dance and play with you. If you pay another eight or ten yuan, they are also willing to go upstairs with you, and there are rooms available for rent there, each limited to half an hour. Once, in a bar, I heard a man on the phone summoning four of the most beautiful women to his house. In a moment, I saw four women sitting in a car and rushing to go.

In the central area of Shanghai, there are still dozens of high-end brothels run purely by Chinese people. Their customers are all wealthy Chinese. The women in these brothels are dressed beautifully and luxuriously. Their price is fifty yuan for a few hours. If the woman is well-known, the price is often doubled. A reporter once tried to visit this type of brothel. Although I had been told about the experience by two Chinese friends beforehand, after arriving there, the guard did not let me in, and I still could not enter. These brothels often prepare brandy and opium to entertain customers. Most of the women here have received a considerable education. A prostitute does not receive several customers every night. The women in these places are mostly familiar with modern hygiene methods. (To be continued)

How to Set Up a Small Experiment by Yang Chunlv (Children's Weekly)

A few years ago, Mr. Chen Heqin said this: There are more than 700 children's science research institutes in Russia. The three he visited were divided into eleven departments, including telephone, radio, automobile, photography, chemistry, mechanics, etc. Each department has a laboratory, and the automobile department has two cars, which were built by children aged eleven to seventeen and participated in a 60-kilometer race on the Moscow Avenue. There is a traffic light on Mosley Street that was invented by children.

Children, after hearing this, what are your thoughts on Russian children being able to enter research institutes, have new inventions, and do new work? Although China does not currently have a children's science research institute that can provide you with experiments, you can set up your own small laboratory as a place for research.

If your home has a suitable empty room that can be used as a laboratory, you can clean it up, hang scientific charts on the walls, place a table by the window, and put a cabinet next to it to display various scientific books and experimental equipment. This is the most perfect. Otherwise, you should choose a suitable place and set up a table specifically for placing various instruments and experimental work. The great inventor Edison sold newspapers on the train when he was young and opened a small laboratory in the corner of the carriage, where he did his experimental work whenever he had free time. This spirit is worthy of our emulation.

The equipment of a small experiment room certainly cannot be purchased with large instruments. Even simple things are not easy to buy one by one. Therefore, the only way to obtain experimental equipment is to make it yourself. Natural history specimens should be collected carefully at any time and place, and made by yourself. Simple instruments can also be made from waste materials or borrowed from daily utensils. A broken light bulb can be made into a flask; an empty ink bottle can be used as an alcohol lamp; a bamboo tube with a few holes is a water pressure tester; an old iron nail wrapped with a few turns of insulated wire becomes an electromagnet. Household glass cups, basins, spoons, clothes pegs, etc., are also used for experiments from time to time.

Children! Use your clever brains to design a small laboratory for scientific research for yourself. Take off your gloves and use your pair of omnipotent hands to harvest the fruits of science.

Jinhua Elementary School Students Organize National Construction Children's Camp by Yi

Jinhua, the most prosperous place in Zhejiang Province today, is also the most developed educational center in the province. All large and small schools are gathered here. Although Japanese planes occasionally go there to bomb, the general public has become accustomed to it and does not take it as a big deal. What is admirable is that recently, elementary school students in Jinhua County organized a National Construction Children's Camp. The date of establishment was in early September. In their spare time, they took on the most difficult work for the rear people during the war. The total number of students participating reached 10,000, with girls accounting for a quarter. The age of these elementary school students is at most fifteen or sixteen years old, but their calmness and courage in handling affairs show that they have received considerable rigorous training in the past. Now, I will tell some of this to the children in Shanghai who are used to enjoying themselves, so that you can know how the children in the rear are struggling, and what about us?

Their organization can be said to be completely militarized. The highest leader is called the Commander-in-Chief, who is also elected from among the elementary school students. However, there are several local officials and principals who serve as consultants. Below this are several departments, each responsible for their own affairs. I will not report the organization in detail. Let's talk about what they do.

The first thing is "rescue." Whenever a Japanese plane bombing occurs, they immediately notify the branch camps in the bombed area, and then the young camp soldiers immediately carry various rescue beds and equipment to set off. Upon reaching the destination, they find civilians who have been injured (the seriously injured are the responsibility of another civilian rescue team) and immediately apply medicine, bandage, and carry them. They are not panicked at all and handle things in an orderly manner. The effect is not as good as that of adults.

The second thing is "patrol." After the alarm of a Japanese plane arriving, each branch camp immediately sets off in batches to help the police work. They lead pedestrians to nearby air-raid shelters to hide, and they help to extinguish car lights immediately. If there are lights and loud noises in the house, they will come forward to intervene. When the Japanese planes arrive, almost the entire county becomes a dark and dead city. The time spent is less than three minutes. They do not return to the camp until the alarm is lifted.

The third thing is "propaganda." During holidays or Sundays, each branch camp is scheduled to take turns forming a roving lecture team to give lectures outside the city. Naturally, the materials are all kinds of wartime issues and reports. The passionate words and sincere attitude can move the listeners considerably. In the near future, they also plan to organize farmer education classes to implement the popularization of basic education for the people during the war.

The above three are just some of their more important tasks. Naturally, there are many others, but due to space constraints, they will not be described in detail. (Excerpted from the Daily News Report column of the Miller's Review)

Small Toys by Long Jusheng

Small toys are something that children welcome! Like the various animal and military toys from the Kangyuan Can Factory, the clay figures from Quanshan, Wuxi, etc., they are the beloved things of city children. But now is the era of advocating scientific toys. It is indeed an urgent task to instill scientific knowledge in children and provide them with scientific toys. Here is Qian Gongwei, the inventor of the economical electric light, who has loved studying electricity and cutting toys since he was a child. Recently, he released a new type of "Universal Flashlight," which is small and exquisite (available in various colors), with a small leather clip attached, which contains keys, is clean and beautiful, and the light is bright, making it convenient to carry around at night. It can be used as desired. It is not only a practical product for the family, but also a great scientific toy for children. How does it shine? How is it assembled? The current in the battery touches the lead wire spring, and then passes from the spring to the electric bulb (like an electric bubble) and shines, which is very interesting to study. As for how to use it, loosen the screws of the leather clip to string in several keys. Turning the screw at the rear end of the flashlight forward will make it shine, and turning it back will turn off the light. It is sold in major companies' electrical departments and various material stores, and it is a truly interesting scientific small toy!

Cricket by Zhan Zhongkuang

After the scorching summer, the climate seems to have changed. The sun does not have the fiery power of the past, and the breeze is also carrying coolness. The days tell us that this is the season of early autumn again.

In this late summer and early autumn, the natural world has another brave and fighting musician to accompany it. At the same time, in a corner of the crowded and bustling intersection of Yuqia Township Road and Guangdong Road, there is also a seasonal embellishment. The people who sell them gather in groups of twos and threes with bamboo tubes and earthen jars, waiting for customers to come. Children, you may know this brave and good-singing cricket.

Crickets, also known as "Promote Weaving," are musicians in the insect family. They have small and exquisite bodies, but they have teeth like iron pliers and a brave, unyielding, and fighting-to-the-end spirit. Whenever they face each other, they are just like enemies meeting. They will inadvertently open their teeth, raise their legs, and rush forward regardless of their lives, fighting to the death until the final victory. At that time, the victor will drum up its wings and sing loudly. This is probably its triumphal song!

It is said that there are several kinds of cricket chirping, but it is not easy for us to distinguish them when we hear them. When we hear the "Gu Gu Gu" chirping in silence, we only think it is pleasing to the ear, but those who have a heart will have infinite emotion.

I love crickets very much. I remember when I was in my hometown, when this early autumn season came, I always liked to keep and play with it in my spare time or holidays. But after the sound of gunfire, I came to this bustling Shanghai, and my mood was taken away by the environment and life. Now that it is the season for crickets, I can only understand it in my heart.

Clothes by Lin Ren

The weather is getting colder day by day. The west wind blew all night, and the sky during the day was covered with gray and white clouds, blocking the sunlight. The cold wind blew even harder. All the heat on the ground was blown away by the wind. The mercury column on the thermometer dropped faster. The wind blowing on the face seemed to be hitting it. Of course, everyone is afraid of this kind of wind. On A Liang's body, his mother put on a woolen shirt for him, and then covered it with a vest. Indeed, it felt much warmer on his body this way. Otherwise, it would be empty, and cold wind would blow in from the cuffs, which would be very uncomfortable.

"Ah, clothes really give you a lot of warmth." A Liang shook his head and talked, with some smiles on his face.

"That's right, you are really lucky to be born in this kind of family. Look at the children of poor families. Where do they have clothes to add?" His mother said with a smile. The old lady meant to teach A Liang not to be dissatisfied.

"A Liang, you just said that clothes can give you a lot of warmth. This sentence is not quite right." A Liang's words were heard by his father, who came to correct his mistake. At this time, A Liang also turned his head, and his father continued to say: "When the weather is cold, wearing more clothes, you don't feel cold, it seems that clothes can give you a lot of warmth. On the surface, it seems that there is nothing wrong, but you must know that in fact, clothes can't give you any warmth, but the warmth you get still depends on yourself. How can this be said? Why do we feel cold when we don't wear more clothes? These are all because our body has a kind of metabolism, that is, the things we eat will become a new part of the body, and the original part will die. It seems that the skin on the hand is accidentally broken, and then a new layer of skin grows under the old skin. This is also a kind of metabolism. (To be continued)

Miscellaneous Notes on the Suo Lin Nang (Part 1) by Hua Yu

Finally heard Cheng Yanqiu's "Suo Lin Nang." This script is the work of Chen Moxiang and is written very vividly. It depicts the delicate state of a wealthy lady in her boudoir very meticulously. It is also very appropriate to describe the poverty of a poor woman and the wealth of a rich woman in the wedding ceremony. Although the scene is a bit bland, it is still compact. The deletion of light and dark scenes is also quite symmetrical. The writing of the coldness of the world and the rich and noble's ignorance of hunger and cold is also very subtle. Its good point is that Xue Xiangling's temper is not good, and it is written using the method of setting off. The words of the Lu Yuanwai couple when they instructed Mother Xue are inserted before and after, which can describe the woman's rambling and eagerness to love her son, which is not very rigid. Its shortcoming is that the first half of the scene is too scattered, and the second half of the scene is too rushed. The transition is too obvious and simple. Although it is simplified, it is too reckless and easy to cause the audience to feel flustered. Another shortcoming is that the "Suo Lin Nang" is not explained. After Madam Lu rebukes Xue Xiangling for being bold, Xue Xiangling hides the bag behind her, and then the bag is never seen again, and it is not seen hanging in the niche again. It seems that the center point is not concentrated enough. Also, the scene in the middle, which inserts the views of the people on wealth and poverty, is too cumbersome, and the insertion of jokes and comments is too vulgar. It is too abrupt to come to the Lu family to seek refuge in the second half. I think it would be more complete if Hu Po came. In addition, there are too many new words in the lyrics, which do not conform to the modernization of the times. You should know that "Suo Lin Nang" is still considered an ancient play and should not be equated with modern drama. In addition, Lu Yuanwai does not need to wear a beard. Zhao Luhan should reappear to receive the support of his son-in-law, so as not to leave any gaps. But on the whole, it is still steady. As for the supporting roles, there are too many idle characters, so there are too few tense scenes. Gu Juesun does not have three scenes. In the first scene, he did not say a word. Sun Futin and Zhang Chunyan are not important, and Cao Ergeng is also relaxed. Only Wu Fuqin and Furong Cao are still tired and add color. Yanqiu's early plays were mostly compiled by Luo Shou Gong. None of the characters in the entire scene were unimportant. If there was a lack of character, the whole play would be diminished. Li Yuru's "Thirteen Sisters" is even more evenly matched. I hope to correct this point.

As for the acting skills of the supporting roles, Zhang Chunyan is experienced and disciplined, with plenty of leeway, and is indeed a good match. The side figure in the scene where he listens to the comments of passers-by is extremely beautiful. Sun Futin and Gu Juesun have no place to use their talents. Cao Ergeng has nothing to do. Ci Shaoquan is okay. Su Shengui is very complete, probably because he has a lot of experience. His voice is pleasant to listen to, and his acting is not sloppy. Furong Cao plays Meixiang, and Hu Po is played by Liu Binkun, both of whom are quite outstanding and moving.

Xiao Lang has starred in "The Electric Man," which is currently being screened in Nanjing.

Chongqing (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 1st): Chinese troops in northern Henan stormed into Zhengzhou around midnight yesterday and occupied it. Official sources here have received reports, and detailed information will be released tonight.

Luoyang: Japanese troops, who crossed the old and new Yellow Rivers and entrenched themselves in Zhongmu, Zhengzhou, and the old Rongze County, repeatedly launched attacks in several directions towards Zhangzhuang Street (southwest of Zhongmu), Shiba Lihe (south of Zhengzhou), Huanggang Temple (southwest of Zhengzhou), Xushui Town (west of Zhengzhou), and Guangwu (west of the old Rongze County), but were repelled by Chinese troops. The Chinese troops continuously attacked the Japanese troops entrenched in these areas, inflicting repeated blows.

Chinese troops bravely fought back against the attacking Japanese troops, and after fierce fighting until 10:00 PM, the Japanese troops attacking Zhangzhuang Street, Nancao, Shiba Lihe, Huanggang Temple, Xushui Town, and Shifo retreated. The Japanese troops in Zhengzhou were also pursued and retreated towards Jing-Shui Town. Chinese troops then advanced in multiple directions. One route recaptured Zhengzhou City at midnight that night, another route had crossed Liuqiao, and another route was attacking the crossing points towards Jing-Shui. The Japanese troops from the old Rongze County to Bawang City are still stubbornly resisting, and Chinese troops are stepping up their attacks. (Electric dispatch of the 1st)

Chongqing (United Press dispatch of the 1st): A military spokesman announced today that Chinese troops began entering Zhengzhou at 1:00 AM. Japanese troops in Zhengzhou engaged in a final battle with Chinese troops in the suburbs yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, after which Japanese resistance collapsed. Since the Japanese troops occupied Zhengzhou, Chinese troops have actively harassed them. The Japanese retreat was due to Chinese guerrilla activity, which made it impossible to maintain communications, and a lack of sufficient troops to defend the city.

Luoyang: (1) On the night of the 21st, a unit of Chinese troops broke into Zhengzhou City, burned down two Japanese warehouses, killed over a hundred Japanese troops, and destroyed a large quantity of Japanese supplies. (2) On the 29th, Japanese troops from Zhengzhou launched an attack towards Shiba Lihe and Huangshan Temple, engaging in a fierce battle with a unit of Chinese troops until Shenshi (3-5 PM), but were eventually repelled by the Chinese troops, suffering heavy casualties. (3) On the 21st, a unit of Chinese troops attacked Hebi, northwest of Tangyin, and engaged in a fierce battle until Chou Shi (1-3 AM) on the 22nd, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers, and damaging several sections of the Tangyin-Hebi highway.

Chinese troops recaptured strongholds such as Wangjiagou and Tianshen Temple on the night of the 28th and continued to attack the Japanese. Japanese troops on the Shijiatan side, after being repelled by the Chinese, were reinforced and launched a counterattack, and fierce fighting resumed near Shijiatan.

(Electric dispatch of the 31st)

Chongqing: The war in the Longmen Mountain area on the east bank of the Yellow River is still extremely fierce.

Chinese and Japanese troops are still fighting fiercely in the original battleground. (Electric dispatch of the 2nd)

Chongqing (Reuters dispatch of the 1st): The situation in western Shanxi, where the Japanese troops launched an offensive, is currently unclear. The only news known today is that Japanese aircraft bombed Yumen near Longmen. This place is on the east bank of the Yellow River, and the Japanese move is obviously intended to prevent the Chinese reinforcements from aiding the defending troops at the Longmen crossing, as the Japanese consider the Longmen crossing to be their target.

Louxi Bay Area: Japanese Troops Cleared

Changde: Japanese troops entrenched in Louxi Bay, across from Yueyang, have recently been pursued by Chinese troops and unable to stand their ground. On the morning of the 29th, they split up into small boats and fled back to Yueyang. There are no longer any Japanese traces in the Louxi Bay area. (Electric dispatch of the 31st)
