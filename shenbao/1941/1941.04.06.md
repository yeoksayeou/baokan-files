### Cuba and the Philippine Islands Cooperate with the US to Prevent Military Supplies from Being Shipped to Axis Countries

### US Considers Currie Report, Will Adopt Active Steps to Aid China, Hopes China Trusts Democratic System, Foreign Minister Guo to Return to Chongqing Via US to Take Office

Washington – Yesterday was China Day at the White House. However, the content of the White House discussions and any decisions made are not yet known. After returning from fishing, President Roosevelt worked at his desk and cleared up many matters. In the afternoon, he summoned Currie, who came from Chongqing, and considered his report on his visit to China. At yesterday’s press briefing, reporters asked the President for his views on aid to China. The President replied that he would have to wait until after meeting with Currie before he could comment. Therefore, active steps to aid China are expected to be taken at any time in the future. At the same time, Washington is now watching the changes in the Chongqing government with great interest. It is generally believed that these changes will strengthen the Kuomintang regime. The establishment of the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Commerce is also regarded as a result of Currie’s visit to China, which will make China’s economy stronger. This is one of the important plans necessary for victory in the war. People here warmly welcome the resolution passed by the Central Executive Committee to continue the war until all Japanese troops in China are driven out, and regard the declaration emphasizing the necessity of national military unity and discipline as a demonstration of the Chinese government’s determination not to allow communist armies, etc., to take advantage of the wartime situation to pursue other agendas. American officials also hope that the Central Executive Committee’s belief in the rhetoric of a civil political system will not just be lip service, but that the Chinese government will continue to move forward to achieve civil governance goals as the situation permits and as political education progresses. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington – The appointment of Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, as the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs seems to have come naturally and unexpectedly, as there was no prior indication of it. People here all know that Ambassador Guo is a very capable diplomat who has achieved considerable success in London. Now that he is in charge of foreign affairs, he will definitely be able to make achievements. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington – The Chinese Embassy here has confirmed the news of Guo Taiqi’s transfer to Minister of Foreign Affairs. According to another Chinese source, Guo will definitely travel to Chongqing via the United States. (United Press, 5th)

London – The Standard Evening News praised Guo Taiqi’s appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs. It stated that Guo Taiqi is an outstanding diplomat who is well-versed in Western culture. This decision by the Chinese government to select him as Minister of Foreign Affairs is extremely appropriate. Guo represented China at the Treaty of Versailles conference, but withdrew from the conference in protest against the Shandong Treaty. Guo's speeches in the United Kingdom have always been of great interest to the British. Over the past eight years, Guo has not only deepened his understanding of English literature, but has also established a collection of noble Chinese books and porcelain in the embassy to preserve his own cultural identity. When Matsuoka traveled to Europe, China appointed Ambassador Guo as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Matsuoka must have felt not only great anxiety upon hearing this, because Matsuoka should remember Guo as the most formidable opponent when debating the Northeast issue in Geneva. At the same time, Guo is one of the four famous politicians who defended China's war of resistance, and his proficiency in English and French, as well as the precision of his arguments, are admired by the world.

### 800 Japanese Residents of Panama to Be Sent to Japan

Tokyo – The Nisshin Maru is scheduled to return to Japan from Los Angeles City on the 24th, carrying 800 Japanese residents of Panama.

### US Government Prepares to Take Over Factories, Seeking to Quickly Resolve Labor Strikes

Washington – Yesterday, striking workers continued to hold up tens of millions of dollars worth of defense products. President Roosevelt issued a warning of intervention in labor strikes and takeover of factories, saying that the strike at the Allis-Chalmers plant in Milwaukee was having the most serious impact on national defense, and that if it was not resolved quickly, the government would have to take action. As for the huge Ford factory in Detroit, the strike has only lasted for three days and has not yet reached a critical level. The President also said that he had received reports that the Allis-Chalmers strike was being instigated by communists, but this could not be used to oppose all workers. The resolution of the labor strike may require the takeover of several factories and the enactment of strike laws. (United Press, 5th)

Washington – President Roosevelt discussed the issue with his cabinet members for three hours yesterday. The main topic seemed to be the labor strike issue. It is reported that Secretary of War Stimson advocated taking strong direct action to break the suspension of national defense production. (United Press, 5th)

### British Ship Buffalo Struck a Mine and Sunk in Singapore

Singapore – The Navy ship Buffalo struck a mine and sank while rushing to the aid of an aircraft that crashed near Singapore yesterday. According to a public announcement, there were minor casualties. (Reuters, 5th)

### British, American, and Dutch to Hold Far East Defense Conference, Dutch Foreign Minister to Fly to Philippines Tomorrow to Attend, Brooke-Popham and Kerr to Meet in Hong Kong

Manila – Observers today speculated that when General Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces, returns to Singapore from Hong Kong on Tuesday, it is highly possible that British, American, and Dutch defense talks will be held in Manila. Observers also believe that the Netherlands may participate in these talks, as Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens of the Dutch government-in-exile in London is scheduled to arrive here on Monday aboard a clipper plane. US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre has cancelled his trip to Baguio and is currently staying in Manila to receive British and Dutch leaders and senior officials who will participate in the talks. Those participating will include Rear Admiral Helfrich, Commander of the Dutch East Indies Fleet, who is currently flying to Manila from Batavia to meet with Kleffens. If the British and Dutch navies conduct talks with US officials, it will be the first decision for a joint British, American, and Dutch defense conference to be held in the Far East. General Brooke-Popham met with senior US military, naval, and municipal officials here earlier this week, and then flew to Hong Kong. (United Press, 5th)

Washington – Newspapers here did not express much interest in the meeting of British and American military leaders in Manila. When Secretary of State Hull was asked about this matter, Hull's answer was evasive. However, the New York Times pointed out that this was a natural and logical meeting, stating that the situation in East Asia will become clearer as a result. The interests of Britain and the United States in Asia all tend towards a common goal. What is this goal? It is that the Eastern countries should have the freedom to seek their own livelihoods without being dominated by powerful countries that oppress the happiness of others for their own selfish interests. Singapore, which is defended by Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Air Forces, is a fortress in the line of defense against Japanese advance to the south. The United States has many ships in the Pacific, and Singapore can provide base convenience for them. Therefore, the exchange of information between the two sides is indispensable, and it is believed that this exchange has already taken place in Manila. (Reuters, 5th)

Hong Kong – Yesterday, two senior British officials stationed in the Far East arrived here, one being British Ambassador Kerr, who was passing through to Chongqing, and the other being General Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces, who came from Manila, where he had consulted with senior British military officials.

Editorial

### American Concerns Regarding China's Civil Governance

Yesterday, Reuters Washington reported that all important actions and movements in the US President's office were centered on the China issue, hence yesterday was called China Day at the White House. It also stated that the US is expected to take active steps to aid China at any time in the future. People must love themselves before others love them; people must help themselves before others help them. China's arduous and extraordinary struggle, which has lasted for 45 months to date, will undoubtedly feel happy and comforted without any shame upon learning of this beautiful response from the United States! The dispatch mentioned that the recent partial changes in the organization and personnel of the National Government are considered to have strengthened the regime; the resolution to continue the war until all Japanese troops withdraw from the country, and the declaration of national military unity and strict discipline, are also accurately recognized. It can be seen that American officials not only have very little misunderstanding of China's national foundation, national policies, and political situation, but also express their approval, which contains positive support significance, based on clear understanding. Finally, the dispatch earnestly emphasizes the realization of a civil political system and the achievement of civil governance goals. Regarding this point, the Chinese government and people must not only feel "This is exactly what I want," and continue to intensify their efforts, but also feel that the American side's earnestness is not only based on its own beliefs and elaborating its own theories, thus extending it to others; but also has a stronger friendship filled within it. For both individuals and countries, the deepest and most enduring friendship is based on everything being the same and uniform between each other, making it the most precious combination and the most reliable foundation. Now, the United States hopes that China's civil governance will be completed as soon as possible, which transcends the "evangelization" of theory and faith, but is genuine concern and sincere expectation.

Observing "Civil Governance in China": China has been a nation rich in the spirit of civil governance since history. It is fundamentally suitable for civil governance, and knowledgeable people commonly believe that the only way to long-term peace and stability is civil governance. The Kuomintang, which is currently in power, regards the Three Principles of the People as the lifeblood of building the country and establishing the party. The essence of the Three Principles of the People is an entire doctrine, and it absolutely does not allow for the division or crippling of the three principles. Regardless of abandoning any part of the Three Principles of the People, or saying that emphasizing two is less than one, or saying that preserving one and removing two, it will not become the Three Principles of the People. Abandoning the entire Three Principles of the People means that there is no way to establish the party or build the country. The Principle of Democracy is one of the three elements of the Three Principles of the People, and a civil political system is the spirit and form of the Principle of Democracy. Therefore, the Kuomintang must take the realization of a civil political system as the main goal of being in power, and the inevitable direction of being in power. Other countries and Chinese people outside the Kuomintang should not worry that the Kuomintang is unwilling to achieve civil governance goals, and should only worry that they are not giving the Kuomintang the necessary time and space to complete a civil political system. However, the facts show that there is no need for such worry and concern. In other words, with the Kuomintang in power and believing in the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle of the nation, it is indeed the best guarantee for reaching civil governance.

At present, China is in the transitional stage between Kuomintang tutelage and constitutional government. In terms of the form of political organization and the essence of political operation, there is no need to hide the fact that it is not the civil governance that the British and American people are familiar with. However, this is not a state of "centrifugal force" from civil governance, but precisely a process of "centripetal force" towards civil governance: that is, it is not a degeneration from civil governance, but a progress towards civil governance. Regardless of nationality or party affiliation, everyone who studies history must know the ironclad facts of the chaos in national politics and the disturbances in national policies after China suddenly established a republic. Everyone who studies politics must know the general theory that in any nation, if the people do not have the conditions for civil governance, forcibly implementing civil governance will have inevitable bad consequences. Such theory and such facts are enough to prove how correct Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revelation of using tutelage as a transition and preparation method is. The Kuomintang established its capital in Nanjing and came to power in the 16th year of the Republic of China, which is 1927, only 14 years ago. Given the distance that the vast population is from the necessary conditions for civil governance, and the impact of the severe foreign troubles on politics and administration in the past decade, no one can bear to ask why the transitional period of tutelage has not yet passed? Even less can anyone bear to doubt the Kuomintang's sincerity in realizing civil governance!

In the past 14 years, the Kuomintang has worked hard and endured hardships and may not be understood by others. There are many, many places that can be criticized for all the measures taken. However, examining it from the perspective of seeking civil governance, even in the midst of all kinds of worries and difficulties, it cannot be said that the preparatory work for realizing civil governance has been wasted for 14 years. Vigorously promoting local autonomy is undoubtedly the main foundation of the lower layer of a civil political system. Although the establishment of the Political Consultative Council cannot be immediately referred to as civil governance, it is the most natural stepping stone and the most solid bridge at the end of the tutelage period and before constitutional government. In the theory of political science, the Political Consultative Council does not meet the general conditions and methods of modern civil governance. However, in the practical application of politics, it has supplemented the institutions that were not prepared during the tutelage period, and has exerted the extremely valuable spirit of democratic politics. Furthermore, it has laid a solid foundation that only allows progress and does not allow regression, and will ultimately realize a genuine civil political system. In other words, the achievements of the Political Consultative Council in practical politics have indeed exceeded the measurement of methods, exceeded the innate essence, and exceeded general expectations. Regarding this point, it is believed that experienced political observers at home and abroad will agree with this view.

We not only do not despise all the methods, procedures, and formalities commonly used in civil political systems, but also quite admire them. We also acknowledge the basis of their arguments when we judge civil governance based on methods, procedures, and formalities. However, examining several countries that have implemented civil governance systems, but have recently "centrifuged" from civil governance, degenerated, and gradually lost the spirit of civil governance, are they necessarily publicly abandoning all the methods, procedures, and formalities commonly used in civil political systems? Therefore, when observing civil governance in China, in addition to the above-mentioned processes and principles, and in addition to general methods, procedures, and formalities, we should understand how the Chinese government and people, in their efforts to resist the great cause of resistance, are spiritually, ideologically, and in their various different views, interacting, communicating, and how they have managed to gather strength and understand and complement each other? We suspect that if China already had a basic law and a supreme parliament, whose methods, procedures, and formalities of production were as formal and legally guaranteed as those of general civil governance countries, but the spiritual essence was unsound, even if it was called civil governance, would it necessarily benefit the resistance war! We firmly believe that haste makes waste, and excessive steps will lead to stumbling. Advancing in an orderly manner will eventually lead to civil governance!

### Matsuoka Left Germany Last Night, Taking the Soviet Route to Return Home, Met with Hitler Again the Day Before Yesterday, Chinese Side Closely Watching Matsuoka's Actions

Berlin – German wireless radio announced that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka is scheduled to leave Berlin tonight and return home via Moscow. (Havas, 5th)

Berlin – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived here from Rome yesterday and immediately held talks with Hitler. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was present. (Reuters, 5th)

Berlin – Hitler received Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka at 4 pm yesterday for talks that lasted a long time. Matsuoka will visit German arms factories this afternoon and then hold talks with the German Foreign Minister again. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

Berlin – Matsuoka visited the German Foreign Ministry this afternoon to meet with Ribbentrop for a final round of negotiations. Matsuoka also met with the heads of Japanese embassies in Europe yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

Chongqing – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Germany and Italy, and his brief stay in Moscow on his return trip, is of great concern to observers here. However, they believe that Japan's attempt to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union may not succeed. Today's editorial in the Central Daily News, entitled "The Closeness of Sino-Soviet Friendship," stated that Sino-Soviet friendship is based not only on historical relations, but also on the common interests of the two countries. Observing the complex and varied European political situation, the Soviet Union is still able to continue to implement its original policies. Now that the Far Eastern political situation is not as complex as that of Europe, there is no doubt that the Soviet Union will continue to assist China in its war and fight for independence. (Havas, 5th)

Rome – The Italian Foreign Ministry's semi-official weekly "International Relations" stated that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit is extremely important, and this development will be seen in the future. (Reuters, 5th)

Rome – When Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka left Italy, he telegraphed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano to thank them for their warm hospitality. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

### Mexican Senate Approves US-Mexico Agreement

Mexico City – The Mexican Senate held a closed-door meeting and unanimously approved the agreement between Mexico and the United States to jointly use all air bases in both countries.

After approving the above agreement, the Senate adjourned and will reconvene until the 15th of this month. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)

### Germany and Italy Protest and Demand, US Clearly Announces Rejection, Cannot Turn a Blind Eye to Ship Destruction Incidents, More Than Sixty Italian Sailors Charged

Washington

Secretary of State Hull confirmed yesterday that the United States firmly rejects Germany and Italy's protest against the seizure of ships and their demand for the release of the ships. The State Department stated that it is necessary to guard the ships to protect the ships in American ports from being destroyed. The State Department has therefore rejected the protests of the two Axis countries regarding this matter. Hull expressed his disapproval of the Axis countries' protests and demands, stating that the German Embassy could not justify its violation of international law or the breach of the US-German Treaty of Friendship and Commerce. Hull told the German Embassy, "I question whether the principles of international law allow the captain and crew of a ship of one country to destroy a ship that has taken refuge in the port of another country, without regard to local laws and the preferential treatment it has received. There is no clause in the US-German treaty that allows this behavior. The auxiliary machinery of one German ship has now been destroyed, and the propulsion machinery has also been deliberately dismantled. If the scuttling or burning of ships in other ports in the Americas is a precursor to what will happen in American ports, it is incomprehensible that the German government expects the US government to turn a blind eye to the current situation." When replying to the Italian protest, Hull cited American law to justify the legality of the American actions. President Roosevelt stated at a press conference that US Naval Attaché Rice had been requested by the United States to be recalled to the Italian government. As far as can be seen, the destruction of Italian merchant ships was mostly instigated by Rice. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington – All sectors welcomed Secretary of State Hull's clear rejection of the German and Italian protests, considering it to be justified. The public believes that the sharpness of Hull's rejection will increase the current tension between the two countries. Talk of severing relations between the two countries is now rampant again, but the public still feels that the US government will allow the Axis countries to do it first. (Reuters, 5th)

New York – According to news from Cristobal, Panama, the crew of the Italian merchant ship Conte Biancamano, which used to travel the Far East seas, are now being captured by the military and then handed over to the US Army transport ship to be transported to New York. The Italian Consul in Cristobal, Biagini, the captain and two crew members of the ship, two employees of the Italian shipping company, and three American employees are currently being detained. Yesterday, the court charged sixty-four crew members of the two Italian ships detained on Sunday with the crime of conspiring to endanger the United States. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington – The State Department disclosed yesterday that the German authorities in Berlin arrested Hermann, an employee of the US Embassy, and the Embassy negotiated with the German Foreign Ministry. He was released after interrogation. A total of eight Americans were arrested at the same time, all of whom were later released. (United Press, 5th)

### Gan-Hua Army Captures Wanshou Palace, Advancing Towards Nanchang Outskirts, Yue-Hua Army Approaches Chaoyang City

Xiushui – After capturing Xiangfu Temple, the Hua Army took advantage of the victory to sweep eastward. On the evening of the 2nd, they captured the Xishan Wanshou Palace and are still pursuing and encircling the enemy towards the outskirts of Nanchang. (News Agency, 4th)

Chongqing – Military News: (1) The Hua Army, which captured Fengxin, continues to pursue the Japanese army in separate routes, and has crossed Ruli, Wencun, Yanzhishan, Wuming Mountain and other places, and is advancing towards Anyi. (2) In this battle in northern Jiangxi, the Japanese army, with a force of 50,000 to 60,000, fought fiercely with the Hua Army in an area of 400 to 500 kilometers around for half a month, and was defeated. The Hua Army is currently clearing the battlefield. As of the 1st of this month, the results of the battle that have been verified are as follows: More than 24,000 Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, 72 were captured, more than 800 Japanese war horses were captured, 564 war horses were captured, 2,304 rifles were seized, not counting those that were thrown into the Yangtze River and have not yet been retrieved, 18 artillery pieces, 96 light and heavy machine guns, 30 boxes of smoke bombs, 104 grenade launchers, 144 steel helmets, 192 gas masks, and countless other military supplies. (3) The Japanese troops retreating from Meihua, Jinpu, Xiyan, Baizhu Ridge, etc., in the Chaoyang area fought fiercely with the Hua Army all day on the 30th of last month and were defeated and retreated. The Hua Army immediately captured these places and is now cooperating with the troops who captured Huangjiashan to besiege the county seat. (News Agency, 4th)

### He Yingqin Discusses the Battle Situation in Northern Jiangxi

Minister of Military Administration and Chief of General Staff He Yingqin made a statement to reporters today, stating that while the general opinion is that the Chinese army will continue to resist as long as the Japanese army does not withdraw from Chinese territory, he must go a step further, that is, the Chinese army and people will continue to annihilate the Japanese army as long as it does not withdraw from Chinese territory. He also reviewed the recent battles in western Hubei and northern Jiangxi, strongly emphasizing the great significance of the victory of the Hua Army on the front line in northern Jiangxi, which is the most outstanding victory of the Chinese army since the Sino-Japanese War. He mentioned the Battle of Yichang, in which the Japanese army only mobilized a small number of troops from Yichang to advance south, with a force of about three platoons, but supplemented by aircraft, artillery, cavalry, and engineering teams. The battle lasted only six days, and the Hua Army repelled them with even fewer troops than the Japanese army. He also talked about the battle in Jiangxi Province, saying that from a geographical point of view, although the Battle of Shanggao may not seem as important as the Battle of Yichang, there is no doubt that the battle in Jiangxi Province will have profound consequences for the future development of the Sino-Japanese War. When the Japanese army attacked west from Nanchang in an attempt to encircle the Hua Army, the Hua Army, which was holding a strong position in the mountains east of Shanggao, first paid attention to the flanks of the Japanese army. After defeating its flanks, it approached the center of the Japanese army, resulting in a complete failure of the Japanese army. The victory in Jiangxi Province boosted the morale of the officers and soldiers of the Hua Army. According to the latest telegrams from the front, the Hua Army is now pressing towards the outer defense line of Nanchang. He finally stated that he had telegraphed Xue Yue, the commander-in-chief of the Hunan-Jiangxi front line, and Luo Zhuoying, the commander of the Nanchang front, to congratulate them on their victory in the battle. (Reuters, 5th)

### Mercenary Troops in Suiyuan Defect One After Another

The Chen Bingyi Department was defeated by the Hua Army in Xincheng this time, and most of them surrendered. (News Agency, 4th)

Chongqing – Recently, the Japanese side broadcasted that there would be changes in the Chinese ambassadors to the Soviet Union and the United States.

軍委會發表一週戰況
Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation

重慶
Chongqing

A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that the battle situation this week is still the most intense in northern Jiangxi, followed by southern Guangdong and western Suiyuan, although there were slight contacts, but they were all small in scale and of little value, so they are only reported incidentally later. Now, let us first describe the battle in northern Jiangxi.

贛北之戰
Battle of Northern Jiangxi

The Japanese army pre-arranged two divisions, one brigade, and a crowd of 50,000 to 60,000, and attacked westward in three routes, intending to capture Shanggao in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, the Sakurai Division on the northern route was first defeated by the Chinese army. The Ikeda Independent Brigade on the southern route was then ambushed by the Chinese army. The main force, the Oga Division on the central route, fell into the Chinese army's trap and was heavily surrounded in Guanqiao, Sixi, Huayang, Shitoujie, and other places, launching an annihilation battle. As of the end of last month, most of the invading Japanese had been dealt with by the Chinese army, and a few retreated northeast in two groups. The Chinese army followed closely, annihilating another 1,000 men of the Ikeda Brigade who retreated to Longtanxu, and more than 1,000 men of the Oga Division who retreated to Yanggongxu. Fengxin City was recovered at 4 p.m. on the 29th, and Xiangfuguan at 6 p.m. on the 1st. The Chinese army is advancing towards Xishan, Wanshou Palace, and Nanchang. According to prisoners, the commander of the Oga Division has been killed in battle, the infantry commander Iwanaga is seriously injured, and there are reports that the commander of the Ikeda Brigade is also seriously injured.

粵南
Southern Guangdong

In Southern Guangdong, there were two or three small actions, namely: (1) The Japanese army attacked Hegu from Chaoyang but were repelled by the Chinese army. Now, the Chinese army has captured Huangjiashan and is approaching the western suburbs of the county seat, which should be recovered soon. (2) The Japanese army attacking north from Haifeng reached Tianxin and, after being blocked, attacked Richongxu, suffering heavy losses.

蘇浙
Jiangsu and Zhejiang

The Japanese army, advancing in three routes on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, was completely counterattacked by the Chinese army starting on the 25th. At 8 a.m. that morning, Yangcheng was recovered, followed by Zhangzhuzhen. The Japanese army completely collapsed and retreated along the original route, restoring the original situation as of the 20th.

綏西
Western Suiyuan

In Western Suiyuan, the Japanese and Chinese armies had mutual actions, namely: (1) They joined forces on the south bank of the Hetao Yellow River. After recovering Chai Dengtai and Sengai Yidan, they continued to attack the Japanese army in Lang'erpan, southwest of Zhaojun's tomb, capturing the area on the 28th and destroying the Japanese artillery positions and barbed wire. (2) At 4 p.m. on the 29th, part of the Japanese army attacked from Tongxinggong Guan Niu Ju Wanshenglong, south of Baotou, and another group attacked Baigui from Wanshengjiangxi. Both were blocked by the Chinese army, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. (4th dispatch)

三年建設計劃大綱（續昨）
Outline of the Three-Year Construction Plan (Continued from Yesterday)

重慶
Chongqing

(2) The main tasks of the three-year plan. We believe that operations must strive for final victory, and construction must achieve absolute national defense security. In accordance with these two major principles, we have formulated a three-year plan for joint implementation. The President recently instructed: (A) Regarding political aspects, all our compatriots must recognize that all party concepts and so-called left-leaning and right-leaning ideologies are outdated and old-fashioned empty talk. Therefore, today's political progress suitable for combat is the politics of the new era. Being able to defend oneself is the only way to ensure democracy; without combat, there is no democracy to speak of. The Kuomintang has always taken the task of uniting the people's strength and consolidating national defense as its mission. Now, it is organizing all compatriots to fight an unprecedented bloody battle of self-defense. To complete this task, it has absolutely no partisan prejudices. In terms of the government, it is natural to rectify discipline and improve administrative efficiency, and promote local self-government to establish the foundation of democracy. At the same time, it must require the people of the whole country to recognize the truth that the nation and national defense come first, abandon all outdated concepts that do not fit the times, so that the whole country becomes a unified and strong fighting entity. (B) Regarding economic aspects, in the economic field, we must take advantage of this wartime to establish the foundation of a national defense economy and rapidly complete economic construction work based on national defense needs. This kind of wartime economic measures should not only be implemented during the current war period but must also be extended until the day when absolute security for national defense is achieved. In order to achieve this goal, the government should take various steps to adjust various productions and finance, improve transportation, and require the people of the whole country to be universally frugal and hardworking, concentrate funds, and popularize labor. The President also made comprehensive instructions as follows: In short, if we cannot fight today, we will surely perish. Without national defense, there is no country. All our policies and facilities must be centered on national defense, and all interests and rights and wrongs must be judged based on national defense. Our army must become a highly national defense force. Our politics must become the general mechanism for mobilizing national defense forces. Our economy must be the largest source of cultivating national defense. Our compatriots must also have combat intelligence and be determined to serve the country and abide by national laws and regulations. All cultural and educational undertakings must also meet the needs of national defense and become a part of national defense. (Comprehensive summary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the Program for Resisting Japan and Building the Nation, and the recent instructions of the Party and the President, the main tasks of the two-year plan are specifically stipulated. (1) Enrich military, political, economic, and social work as a prerequisite for winning the final victory. (2) Expand the production of military and civilian materials to meet the needs of the war of resistance and stabilize the lives of the people. (3) Various national defense facilities must be improved during the war and extended after the war. The content of the facilities and the system established according to the needs of these facilities should continue to advance in quality and quantity. (4) Strengthen political organizations, and pay special attention to the establishment of grassroots political institutions to lay the foundation for democracy. (5) Adjust all political, economic, and social organizations in accordance with the Party's political program and policies, so that their institutions, personnel, laws, and regulations can become the hub for mobilizing national defense forces. (6) All cultural and educational undertakings must adapt to the needs of national defense. The education and training of various talents must be coordinated with the plans of other departments, so that talent preparation is adapted to the progress of the cause, and all plans can be completed on time.

(3) Implementation procedures of the plan. The main tasks of the three-year plan are as described above. We should formulate plans for each department based on these main tasks and then coordinate them to become a wartime three-year construction plan. However, this so-called plan is not the plan itself, but the plan's intake. The procedure from the plan's intake to the implementation of the plan is as follows: (1) The implementation period of this outline of the plan should be from 1942 to 1944. Because the plans and budgets for the next year have now been drafted by various agencies, this outline of the plan can be used as the basis for drafting. From July to December this year is the preparation period. (2) This outline of the plan is the general route for construction work within three years. However, the wartime situation is unpredictable. In order to adapt to the changing environment, this outline of the plan does not focus on annual plans and progress schedules. Each department should consider the actual situation of the year and formulate its annual plan and work progress separately. (3) This outline of the plan can only make a general estimate of the funds. Therefore, the funds listed in the plan will be incorporated into each department's annual budget by year. This not only can be coordinated with the annual financial situation, but also can adapt to changes in prices. (4) This outline of the plan is compiled based on the plans submitted by various departments. In order to make it a complete plan, two kinds of coordination work must be done: one is the overall coordination of the three-year plan outline, and the other is the coordination of the annual plan and annual budget for each year. These two kinds of work should be organized in detail by the competent authority to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. (5) After this outline of the plan is decided, party and government leaders and party departments at all levels should initiate a universal movement to promote this three-year plan so that this plan can achieve success as scheduled or earlier.

(4) Grassroots political construction. In accordance with the Outline of National Construction and the Law on the Beginning of Implementation of Self-Government, establish grassroots political organizations and complete local self-government. (1) Grassroots political organizations should focus on health facilities, handle local security, popularize national military training, and develop national sports to defend the local area and strengthen the strength to resist insults, so as to realize nationalism. (2) Grassroots political organizations should focus on popularizing education and training the people to exercise political power to establish a foundation for democracy, so as to realize the principle of people's rights. (3) Grassroots political organizations should focus on developing production undertakings, developing transportation, popularizing the cooperative system, strengthening food management, implementing land policies, and promoting land-to-the-tiller so as to develop the national economy and realize the principle of people's livelihood.

(5) In national defense economic construction: A. Regarding finance, (1) Finance and financial forces should cooperate with each other to develop the economy and cultivate tax sources to meet the needs of resisting Japan and building the nation and to establish a foundation for post-war recovery. (2) Promote and expand direct taxes based on the principles of universality and fairness to enrich the main system of national taxation. (3) Promote the current indirect taxes and select bulk daily necessities to implement a monopoly system so as to take into account both national economy and people's livelihood. (4) Provincial finances should be centrally responsible for overall coordination and adjustment, and county finances should be separated from provincial finances and strive for self-reliance so that education, nurture, health, and other policies can develop in parallel and promote the completion of local self-government. (5) Supplement the legal currency reserves and regulate the issuance of banknotes to consolidate value, improve the financial organization, strengthen control, and exert its functions. (6) Adjust foreign trade to increase production, promote exports, and use barter and reciprocity systems to increase friendly relations with friendly countries and obtain their full assistance. B. Regarding transportation, (1) Open up national defense and sea routes to facilitate the import of government materials. (2) Improve and develop inter-provincial transportation to meet the needs of the national economy. (3) Strengthen the link between front and rear transportation to prepare for the final victory. C. Regarding industry and mining, (1) Accelerate the production of raw materials and products needed for military industry to meet military needs. (2) Actively increase export materials to exchange for foreign exchange (3) Cultivate the production of daily necessities to maintain the livelihood of the people in the rear as much as possible. (4) Construct thoughtful industrial and mining enterprises to lay the foundation for industrialization. (5) Proceed with the most urgent needs that are expected to be completed quickly as a priority to ensure that the increase in production is commensurate with the expenditure of funds. (6) Economically, urge state-owned enterprises to cooperate and advance together. (7) In addition to the design of the industrial itself, prepare methods and pay attention to cultivating technical talents. D. Regarding agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, (1) Apply scientific methods to increase the production of clothing and food raw materials, export specialties, and the increase in the production of cattle and horses, and improve their quality. (2) Develop various agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry resources. (3) Prevent and eliminate agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry product processing and manufacturing to meet domestic and foreign needs. (4) Guide farmers' organizations, improve agricultural economic conditions, and improve and promote sideline occupations to develop the rural economy.

(6) National defense social construction, (1) Strengthen the organization and training of national people's organizations to coordinate with military actions to realize total national mobilization. (2) In order to improve social welfare and stabilize the people's lives, consolidate the wartime social order. (3) Promote cooperative undertakings and develop cooperative organizations to promote the development of the wartime social economy. (4) Actively provide relief to refugees, educate and raise orphans, and strengthen their organization and training to collect the displaced and stabilize people's hearts. (5) Actively promote health care and epidemic prevention to enrich the manpower for combat.

(7) National defense education and cultural construction. In the next three years, education should be more in line with the guidelines set by the Party's Fifth National Congress and the Provisional National Congress, seeking to integrate with military and political affairs and closely coordinate with social construction work, so that career development and talent cultivation can advance together to complete the mission of the Anti-Japanese War and Nation-Building Program. The facilities for education at all levels should follow the following principles (1) The promotion of national education should be coordinated with the new county system. In Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces, one central school should be established in each township within three years, and one national school should be established for every two guarantees. (2) The facilities for secondary education should seek quantitative development and qualitative improvement, so as to be able to connect with national education, higher education, and national defense and production undertakings. Special attention should be paid to the expansion and improvement of normal education and women's education. (3) Higher education should be expanded in a coordinated manner by the central government, taking into account manpower and financial resources as well as the needs of various developments. Provinces should be encouraged to set up specialized schools. When adding schools, attention should be paid to the balanced development of various disciplines. Graduate schools should be added. Existing colleges and universities should strive to improve their equipment. (4) Social education should pay special attention to the improvement of people's lives, the cultivation of people's wisdom and morality, and the enhancement of combat awareness. Therefore, in addition to continuing to handle the original affairs, we should also pay attention to the compilation of teaching materials, the training of teachers, and the expansion of the scope of teaching in order to achieve the effect of popular education. (5) Frontier education should raise funds widely and expand it as much as possible, and pay attention to adapting to the local environment to lay the foundation for national unity. (6) Education in guerrilla areas should be closely linked to military and party affairs and continue to be intensified. (7) Overseas Chinese education should use various methods adapted to the environment to seek its expansion, first focusing on the training of teachers and the compilation of teaching materials, and implementing a supervision system to strengthen the connection between domestic and foreign countries.

英軍熟諳沙漠戰術
British Troops Well-Versed in Desert Tactics

德方援義爲時已晚
German Aid to Italy Comes Too Late

開羅
Cairo

A military spokesman here criticized the British withdrawal from Benghazi today, saying that there is absolutely no need to worry because the British strategy in the area is sound and they are well-versed in desert warfare, while the Germans are not proficient in this area. The enemy forces are a mixed force of German and Italian mechanized units, with infantry and aircraft assisting tank offensives. The German offensive was launched three weeks late, possibly with the intention of luring some British forces away from Eritrea to relieve pressure on British forces in that area. However, German aid to Italy is now too late. Enemy troops and materials must be transported from Sicily to North Africa. Although the route is short, it is monitored by the British Navy, and enemy convoys have suffered heavy losses. When asked whether the German army would emulate British strategy and launch a fan-shaped offensive, the spokesman replied that this tactic relies entirely on surprise attacks and is not easy to imitate. Now, the German army can be allowed to roam around, while our army is choosing its battlefield. This is the same as the situation in the autumn when Graziani, the former commander-in-chief of the Italian army in Libya, led his troops blindly. Before the Italian army had scurried to the prepared positions of the British army, it was severely attacked and fell into disrepair. Desert warfare is different from any other land warfare. Only naval warfare can be compared to it. In naval battles, it does not matter how many miles enemy ships advance on the sea. Their losses are the same. The purpose of fighting in the worthless and desolate desert is to inflict maximum losses on the enemy's manpower and resources, and to defeat the enemy by consuming their forces as the final strategy. If our army can defeat the Italian army on the Egyptian border without having to travel long distances to Benghazi, it will be more suitable for our army and will cost less effort. Cyrenaica has no value and is just a redundant burden. Now, although our army has withdrawn to prepared positions, it is still giving the enemy a fierce blow, causing them to be wounded. British losses are minor. Benghazi is useless to both sides. It is an open secret that our army did not use the port after occupying it. The port has been blocked by sunken Italian ships, and port facilities were destroyed by British forces last week, making the port even more useless. It cannot be measured by the depth of its invasion, but must be estimated by the loss of manpower and resources. (5th Reuters dispatch)

The U.S. Navy suffered a disastrous defeat off Cape Matapan in the Mediterranean last week, suffering heavy losses. In the past few days, Italy has also lost five destroyers in the Red Sea, further weakening Italian naval strength. Of these five destroyers, two were scuttled by their crews off the coast of Arabia, and a third was bombed by British aircraft on Thursday and sank yesterday. The other two were sunk by British naval aircraft earlier this week. The two ships scuttled were the Pantellaria and Tigri, both displacing 1,500 tons. The ships sunk by British aircraft were the Leoni (1,500 tons) and the Daniele Manin and Nazario Sauro (both 1,000 tons). Some parts of the two scuttled ships are still above water. According to a report from the commander-in-chief of the British East Indies Fleet, the crews of the two Italian ships that were captured have all landed. It is now estimated that the Italian Navy has recently lost at least ten warships, including three cruisers and seven destroyers. It is also possible that one Italian cruiser and one destroyer have also sunk. Other ships, such as the battleship Vittorio Veneto and many Italian ships, have been damaged. Responsible figures in London believe that Italy still has three destroyers, two torpedo boats, and two or three submarines in the Red Sea, which the British Navy is currently searching for. Of the twenty-two Italian submarines previously announced by London, no more than six or seven are active in the Red Sea. Now that four have been sunk in the Red Sea, only two or three remain.

Lured by Lust in the Entertainment World   Huang Xinde

Joseph Conrad's novel "Victory" has been adapted for the screen, becoming this film "Lured by Lust." Although Conrad's novels are quite famous, past film adaptations of his novels, including this "Lured by Lust," have all been box-office failures. The main reason is that Conrad's appeal lies entirely in his skillful writing, especially when describing ocean scenes, which is both intimate and vivid. After being adapted for the screen, these characteristics are very difficult to maintain.

This film is like a beautifully prepared dish, using excellent ingredients, but unfortunately, it lacks salt and pepper. The main actors in this film, such as Fredric March, Betty Field, and Sir Cedric Hardwicke, are all long-established character actors with reputations, and there are no problems with their acting. However, because the director failed to tightly grasp the island setting of the story and strengthen the tension needed in the story, especially the slow development of the plot in the first half, it lacks strong stimulation.

However, the actors' efforts cannot be denied. Fredric March and Betty Field live in a small, isolated place, while Cedric Hardwicke arrives with his henchman to track them down, aiming to seize his money and lover. Betty kills his henchman, and March kills Hardwicke. This story is originally very simple, but with the efforts of March and others, it feels quite vivid and engaging. Especially March, he portrays the dispirited state of a disillusioned coal mine owner, deeply depicting his indifference to worldly affairs. Later, when he meets Betty and begins to regain his passion, his lifestyle is completely different. Betty Field is a rising star in Hollywood, and her acting is multifaceted. In this film, she is a captivating beauty of a humble background, enchanting and seductive, and her performance is extremely moving. Especially when Hardwicke's henchman comes to court her, her inner performance of shock and hatred, using a plan to lure him to his death, is most commendable. Hardwicke's portrayal of the villain is also successful. Only the fellow who plays the Chinese servant in the film, I'm sorry to say, doesn't leave a good impression on me. (The picture above is of Betty Field, who has the style of Marlene Dietrich.)

### Smiling Mimi's "Tears Like Flowers" Begins Filming - Abandoning Dancer as Lead - Zhou Manhua to Play Mimi

The long-rumored "Tears Like Flowers" is now being brought to the screen. Golden Star has decided to start filming around the 10th of this month. The female lead was originally intended to be played by famous dancers like Yang Wenying, Tian Xiuli, and He Mengdie, but ultimately, due to the nature of the dancers' professions, it was feared that they would not be able to complete the filming as scheduled. Therefore, it was decided to have actors from the Lightning Film Company play the roles instead. The finalized cast includes Shu Shi (Little Li), Xu Feng (Jin Shiyin), Lü Yukun (Little Chen), Gong Jianong (Chang Haicai), Zhou Manhua (Mimi), Yuan Shaomei (Dingxiang), Chen Qi (Gu Xiaomei), and Murong Wan'er (Manli). The cast is well-rounded and evenly developed.

The Philosophy of a Striving Life   Zong Yu

1.  Zengzi said, "A scholar cannot be without breadth and fortitude, for his burden is heavy and his path is long." To strive for the masses, one must be willing to sacrifice everything. If one fails in the struggle, one should die trying. This is a heavy burden, and it is also a long path. To be able to bear the heavy burden and travel the long path is to be broad and resolute.

Blood Rain and Jade Flowers   Gu Mingdao

Chapter Five: The Red Skirt Enviously Kills the Pomegranate Flower

He put on his red phoenix sword, locked his house, and went to the Li family village again. Li Xin then took Xu Jing and some retainers, and they rode into the city to see the magistrate of Qi County. The magistrate of Qi County saw that the people Li Xin brought with him were mostly valiant and not incompetent, and he was naturally happy. He immediately gave Li Xin the construction and asked him to defend the city. All the recruits were under Li Xin's command, and they coordinated with the government troops outside the city to defend together. That evening, the magistrate of Qi County hosted a banquet to celebrate with them, and he allowed Li Xin, Xu Jing, and the retainers to live in the summer quarters. The next day, Li Xin and Xu Jing, accompanied by the magistrate of Qi County, inspected the recruits and divided them into two large teams, A and B. Li Xin and the retainers led Team A, while Xu Jing led Team B, taking turns guarding the city. They prepared bows, arrows, wood, and stones, and lit torches. The people were instructed not to panic, and someone would be responsible for defending against the invaders. From that day on, the rumors intensified, but the people were somewhat relieved because the authorities were prepared. Two days later, scouts reported that a large group of bandits from Green Stone Mountain were indeed attacking Qi County. The government troops were already engaged in battle with the bandits on One-Sided Slope. Upon receiving the news, the magistrate of Qi County did not dare to be negligent and led the recruits to the city to defend it with Li Xin, Xu Jing, and others. The scouts continued to send reports back and forth. By the afternoon, it was learned that the bandits were very brave, and the government troops, led by Commander Ma, could not resist. One-Sided Slope was about to fall, and they requested reinforcements. The magistrate of Qi County had no troops to send and was anxiously pacing back and forth on the city wall. Li Xin volunteered to go to reinforce them, because One-Sided Slope was the shield of Qi County. If One-Sided Slope were lost, the situation for Qi County would be even worse. Therefore, he led Team A of recruits to rescue them, while Xu Jing assisted the magistrate of Qi County in defending the city. The magistrate of Qi County had no other choice and asked Li Xin to go. Li Xin put on his armor, grabbed a rusty silver spear, jumped on his warhorse, and led the recruits. He bid farewell to the magistrate of Qi County and Xu Jing, opened the city gate, and was about to go to the rescue when he learned that One-Sided Slope had already been occupied by the bandits. All three hundred government troops had been wiped out, and Commander Ma had committed suicide. The main force of the bandits was already approaching the city of Qi County. Since Li Xin had already left the city, there was no reason for him to return. So he led his troops to meet them. He saw dust rising in front of him, banners waving, and the main force of the bandits rushing towards them.

(31) Discussions on Films at the Chrysanthemum Garden: One Letter and One Petition in "Four Scholars"   Gu Mei

"Four Scholars" is also known as "The Golden Bracelet Case" or "Integrity and Justice." It is called "Four Scholars" because this opera begins with the oath of the four scholars, Mao, Gu, Liu, and Tian, and ends with the four scholars. The cause of this case is a pair of purple-gold bracelets, so it can be called "The Golden Bracelet Case." Yang Suzhen is commendable for her chastity, Song Shijie and Yang Chun are righteous and generous, Mao Peng is an honest official, and the emperor is a wise and virtuous ruler, hence the name "Integrity and Justice." It has been a popular play in both the north and south in recent years, starting with the offering to the God of Literature, Wenchang Siming Zitong Dijun, and ending with the dramatic highlight of beheading Gu Du on the spot. It can last for five hours. Nowadays, the common performance starts with Mao Peng writing the petition in Willow Forest and ends with Song Shijie in the Second Hall. In between, the role of the old woman is omitted, and the lament of the young woman is deleted. The play, which originally emphasized the roles of the old man, the young woman, the painted face, and the supporting actor, has now become a play where the supporting actor (Song Shijie) is the main character, the painted face is the guest, and the young woman and the clown are supporting roles.

The role of Wan Shi can be played by either a colorful or a flowery actor. In fact, the flowery is the proper style, and Furongcao and Wang Lanfang are both good at playing this role. Zhang Chunyan once told me that Mao Peng is good in every aspect: his body, his face, and his mouth. Li Hongfu, who played Mao Peng for Ma Lianliang, and Liu Yunfang, who played Mao Peng for Zhou Xinfang, are not as good as Zhang Chunyan. Chunyan has never sung Mao Peng, so how could he know that he has such attainments? It is truly admirable.

Wang Youqing is very good at playing the role of Yang Suzhen. He has recorded two sides of the "Four Scholars" Yang Suzhen's lament, and the tune and rhythm are excellent. Hao Shouchen is naturally excellent at playing Gu Du, and Yuan Shihai can be considered Hao's replacement among the younger generation. Zhou Xinfang is the best at playing Song Shijie, and Lei Xifu and Ma Lianliang are also good.

In this play, there is a letter and a petition. The letter is Tian Lun's letter to Gu Du asking for leniency, and the petition is Yang Suzhen's petition to redress her husband's grievances. In the letter, it is written: "Tian Lun bows respectfully and presents this letter to my elder brother, Gu Nian, Prefect of Xinyang. It has been several years since we parted at the Double Pagoda Temple. There is a woman named Yang in Yao Village. She is originally an unruly and unvirtuous person who poisoned her husband with medicated wine and falsely accused her uncle, Yao Tingchun. Three hundred taels of silver accompany this letter. Please consider our fraternal bond and return the lawsuit to my hometown. I will come to your door to thank you, my elder brother." The petition reads: "The petitioner is the widow Yang Suzhen, only eighteen years old, from Yao Village in the Fourth District and Eighth Jia of Shangcai County, Runing Prefecture, Henan. She accuses her uncle, Yao Tingchun, and her aunt, Tian, of poisoning her husband with medicated wine and stabbing her seven-year-old servant, her elder brother Yang Qing, to death. They are also accused of fraudulently selling her husband's property. Her uncle, Yao Yanchun, poisoned her husband, Tingmei, with medicated wine. Her aunt, Tian, stabbed her seven-year-old servant, her elder brother Yang Qing, to death with a sharp knife. Claiming that her mother was ill, they tricked the petitioner into going to Willow Forest and sold her to a stranger, Yang, as his wife. Yang Chun saw the golden bracelet on the petitioner's arm, asked about the situation in detail, and could not bear it. He was willing to forgo the money for her body and tore up the contract of sale on the spot. The two of them became righteous brother and sister. I am submitting this petition to redress the grievances. I have heard that everyone loves the people like their own children and that the law is not unjustly judged. I beg Your Honor to quickly arrest the criminals and bring them to justice, investigate the details of the crime, and punish the evildoers according to the law. My deceased husband will rest in peace in the underworld, and I, a humble woman, will have my life saved. I prostrate myself before Heaven and plead, I prostrate myself before Heaven and plead." This letter is recited three times on stage. Tian Lun recites it once after writing it; Song Shijie also recites it once in the middle of the night when he steals it from the public servants' room and copies it onto his lapel; and Mao Daren recites it publicly again in the Third Court when Song Shijie reveals his lapel. The petition is only read twice. Once when Mao Peng writes it and reads it to Yang Suzhen, and again when Yang Suzhen hands the petition to her adoptive father, Song Shijie, who reads it to Yang Suzhen as well.

Chongqing. The Central Daily News published an editorial this morning strongly affirming the solidity of Sino-Soviet friendship. The article first stated the importance of the Soviet Union's position in the current international situation. It also pointed out that the Soviet Union was the first country to announce its friendship with China after the Sino-Japanese war and the first to conclude a non-aggression pact with China. In the past four years, the Soviet Union has continuously provided China with material assistance and spiritual encouragement. Sino-Soviet friendship is not only based on historical relations but also on mutual interests. In a declaration on March 31, 1939, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov solemnly reaffirmed Stalin's promise to aid those who were invaded.
