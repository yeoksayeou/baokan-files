### Speculation Drives Gold Prices Sky-High; 1,500 Yuan Within Reach

Eagerly Anticipating 2,000 Yuan; Nothing More Than Scarcity of Spot Goods Making Manipulation Easy

Yesterday, the gold market was extremely volatile. Spot gold prices soared unprecedentedly, becoming even more intense, breaking through the 14,000 yuan mark and approaching the 15,000 yuan threshold. A new high of 14,800 yuan was reached, representing a five-day surge of 4,010 yuan, the largest increase on record. The main reason was that Dafeng (a gold firm) was aggressively buying, accounting for more than a quarter of the circulating funds in the city, absorbing over 5,000 taels. Defu in the morning and Mingfeng in the afternoon each bought 200-300 taels, reportedly collecting for a "certain bank." Therefore, even with Hong Kong, Tianjin, Chaozhou, and other regional groups, as well as the Hetae Bank's gold shops, selling, it was still a drop in the bucket. In short, the number of spot gold in this city is limited and easily manipulated. Hence, with multiple parties buying aggressively, coupled with retail investors buying, the market price easily soared. It is not surprising that it rose several hundred or even a thousand yuan in a single day. In fact, according to black market exchange rate calculations, it should not be so high. Therefore, the continuous surge in prices is nothing more than speculative manipulation. The October futures contract saw some covering of short positions, rising from 8,500 yuan to 8,620 yuan, a rise of 170 yuan, with about 200 taels of transactions closed. Gold ornaments also rose by 160 yuan, reaching a peak of 1,510 yuan.

Largest Increase on Record

Spot gold was volatile and uncertain, still hovering and advancing towards a peak. The market opened 130 yuan higher. A certain bank bought 10 taels from Decheng at 13,300 yuan. Defu bought over 200 taels. The price continued to rise to 13,400 yuan. Hesheng vigorously sold, rapidly retreating to 13,180 yuan. Because the US dollar surged to 35 yuan, and Defu and Dafeng were aggressively buying, Li Qinshi, Heyifeng, Yiyuan, Hetae, Shunyuan competed to raise the price, soaring another 710 yuan. Chengda bought, rising to 13,900 yuan. Mingfeng, Xinfeng, Yongyutai, Fengxiang, Heshunyuan, Hesheng, and Decheng vigorously sold, and the price began to fall. When it was heard that the US and Japan were in conflict and the US dollar retreated to 31 yuan, the price sharply declined by 800 yuan to 13,100 yuan. Chengji and Zhongxing bought. Shunyuan and Decheng repurchased. The price was raised at noon. The afternoon closed at 13,400 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon still at 13,400 yuan. Chengji, Xianghe, and Hecheng vigorously sold, retreating to 13,230 yuan. Soon, Dafeng and Mingfeng came to buy again. Xianghe, Yongcheng, Deda, and Li Qin competed to buy, and the price soared by 1,220 yuan, reaching 14,450 yuan. Hetae, Tongkang, and Yongfu sold, sharply retreating to 14,100 yuan. However, Dafeng, Mingfeng, Yongcheng, Yifeng, Chengda, and Decheng competed to buy again, so the price soared again in the evening, rising to the closing price. Decheng bought 20 taels from Yuxingyong, reaching a new high price of 14,800 yuan, a rise of 1,630 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a 1,700-yuan range throughout the day, setting a record for the largest increase and fluctuation ever. A total of 7,000 taels were traded throughout the day. Gold shops sold their own branded gold at a retail price of 15,000 yuan, repurchasing at 500 yuan less.

Spot Futures Lag Far Behind

The October futures market opened with a better market sentiment due to the high spot price, up 70 yuan to 8,500 yuan. Because Xiangxing Yong covered short positions for customers and increased their positions, buying 70 taels, and there were fewer sellers, the price rose by 100 yuan. The noon closing price was 8,600 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM, another 20 yuan higher, at 8,620 yuan. The 4:00 PM closing price was 8,600 yuan, up 170 yuan compared to the previous day, with a range of 120 yuan.

Gold Ornaments Fluctuate Fifteen Times

Jewelry stores' selling price of gold ornaments changed as many as fifteen times a day in Datongxing and Xintongxing, rising a total of 160 yuan, with the final price at 1,510 yuan (repurchasing at 60 yuan less).

### Black Market in Turmoil; Foreign Currency Surge Unabated

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the official exchange rates quoted by the Central Bank and the Exchange Bank. Smaller exchange counters such as HSBC quoted at will. The black market exchange rates for British and U.S. currencies remained chaotic and without a definite official rate. The U.S. dollar rate was uncertain. A certain Chinese broker sold a small amount of telegraphic transfers to New York at 3.375 yuan. Another broker, commissioned by a certain importer who was not allowed to apply, offered 3.25 yuan to buy a larger amount, but there were no transactions. It was said that transferring funds in this city required an additional half yuan. The noon closing rate for British currency was 2/1.1225, and the U.S. dollar remained at 3.375 yuan, the same as the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Yesterday's foreign currency market continued its upward trend. British and U.S. gold pounds surged by 15 yuan following the sharp rise in spot gold prices. British gold certificates were still stable. The market price remained steady. U.S. gold certificates rose again to 35.2 yuan, ultimately reaching 33.2 yuan, a rise of 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day. Supply and demand for Hong Kong currency remained balanced. The market price remained slightly steady. Japanese gold certificates and Korean currency also saw sharp increases. The former rose to 3.13 yuan, and the latter to 4.5 yuan.

### Such a Yarn Market; Only Daily Limit-Ups; Gray Market Still Operating

The surge in the yarn market and the severity of the daily increase make people afraid. This is due to the enthusiastic minds of speculators. The 20-count Shuangma yarn has hit the daily limit for three consecutive days, rising by a huge 200-300 yuan. As for the actual yarn trading, sales are still prohibited. However, industry members are enthusiastically trading the 10-count coarse yarn. The 20-count yarn business is still lacking. Shuangma Factory opened sharply higher in the morning, announcing the daily limit-up at 2,330 yuan. However, after profit-takers sold, it eased to 2,285 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange traded the distant months, with the bid price rising by 105 yuan, causing excitement again, and the price rose to 2,365 yuan, then eased to 2,315 yuan. At this time, the market dispersed, but the exchange trading suddenly crashed at the close, with yarn falling below the previous day's price. It was said that the rumor of the tax ban being lifted on the 24th of this month was false, so the Shuangma gray market fell to 2,240 yuan, a sharp fall of 25 yuan from the previous day's high. The market continued to be suspended in the afternoon, but gray market trading continued, starting at 2,260 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange opened and yarn and cloth suddenly jumped up again. Shuangma followed suit, rising to 2,370 yuan, then falling to 2,310 yuan. Transactions were few and far between. The situation is chaotic and the future is unpredictable. A total of 8,000 bales were traded in half a day, all peer-to-peer transactions among industry members.

The Shuangma gold futures market rose again to a cloud-piercing level. Its upward trend is as firm as a madman's recklessness. Although there is no apparent news development, the general demand from the bullish side is blindly buying regardless of market price, forming an unprecedented situation. The morning factory list opened at 2,330 yuan and immediately hit the daily limit. The futures yarn market was delayed until 10:00 AM due to margin calls. At that time, the exchange was firm and then retreated, and the factory list also fell. Therefore, the November contract opened at 2,190 yuan, then fell to 1,230 yuan. The December contract opened at 2,170 yuan, then also fell to 1,265 yuan. The January contract opened at 2,190 yuan, then also declined to 2,110 yuan. However, the noon closing price for all but the distant month rose by 30-50 yuan. In the afternoon, there was no factory list market. The gray market saw further gains. The futures yarn market rose from soft to strong, showing a surprisingly high trend. The closing was most robust. The November contract closed at 1,270 yuan, up 76 yuan. The December contract closed at 2,238 yuan, soaring 100 yuan, also hitting the daily limit. The January contract closed at 2,258 yuan, also up 100 yuan and hitting the limit. The state of reaching peak after peak can be described as unprecedented. The table is listed below.

### High Cotton Prices; Slow Consumption

The cotton market was stagnant in the morning. The international situation is dangerous, and the yarn and cloth and gold prices suddenly rise and then stagnate, making people confused. It is difficult to break the deadlock. However, the gold price suddenly soared in the afternoon, and those holding goods became firm and only slightly transacted under the increase of more than ten yuan. However, large consumption is still difficult to trigger.

American Rongjiapo 100 bales 7100 Donghua Jin

(Ten-day silver futures delivery to the factory)

Langgonghua 100 bales 563.0 Haojia Jin

Langgonghua 100 bales 567.0 Haojia Jin

A large batch of cotton arrived in port. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In addition to foreign rice from Hong Kong, there were also 5,884 bales of cotton. The cotton was produced in India, shipped to Hong Kong and then transshipped to Shanghai.

### Difficulty in Obtaining Grain; Now It Has Become a Ominous Prophecy

Although the ever-rising foreign rice has been briefly suppressed, yesterday it was suddenly blocked by foreign exchange restrictions. Gold prices soared to 14,000 yuan, and yarn and cotton also rose by 100 yuan. Suddenly, the rice market turned red with envy and burning with restlessness. Brokers immediately showed their skills, echoing the speculators in cotton yarn and gold. People in the industry naturally get the moon first near the water tower, and new large hoarders rushed to buy. Retailers and small scattered households followed. At the same time, the leather ball was thrown high, and the succession was not declining. Even though the flat-priced rice was still maintained, it became a pocket of speculators. There was no shortage of chips, and the trading was even more prosperous. The mindset of trading was the most lively. Bank warehouses opened at 144 yuan and reached 148 yuan, while foreign warehouses rose from 143 yuan to 147 yuan and 146.5 yuan, an increase of five or six yuan. Other types, such as No. 1 Saigon, are in short supply due to scarce inventory and sales. The closing price for high-quality goods broke through the 160 yuan mark and reached 162 yuan. Ordinary goods opened at 150.05 yuan, 160 yuan, an increase of seven or eight yuan. Zha Hua rice is as popular as Saigon. The highest price opened at 158-9 yuan. Other types, such as broken tip, rose from 118 yuan to 115.5 yuan, and Tokyo ration rice at 141 yuan, an increase of 2-3 yuan to 4-5 yuan. It was said that the afternoon market opened at 150 yuan.

Thin and thick new broken dual early rice, there are still more than 300 shi of rice to be delivered. At that time, the Kunshan new dual sold for only 161 yuan, and the Qingjiao kiln seed for 160 yuan. After the foreign rice rose, the sellers were determined to sell, and the price increased sharply, and the local shops were also fragrant, and they rushed to buy, an increase of five or six yuan. The Nangang early break opened to 167-8 yuan, the Kunshan new dual to 165 yuan, the Qingjiao kiln seed and Fengjing Bai Ge opened to 164-5 yuan, and the newly arrived Sijing wild rice was still fresh and popular, selling for 170 yuan. Dujian is still out of stock and there is no market.

The situation of glutinous rice is different from other goods, so the distant market goods are scarce and particularly popular. Yesterday it was even more expensive, and Hong Kong Gao Baiyuan actually had a shouting price of 180 yuan. Although it was not realized, it also opened to 178 yuan, and reached 175 yuan. Glutinous green bean is 165 yuan.

Domestic Debt Falls First and Then Recovers

Public debt was traded in the gray market, and the market was stable at first. After entering, the falling wind was strong. Type C broke through the 7 yuan and 6 yuan levels, seeing a small price of 65.65 yuan. The remaining debts also continued to fall. The fall was rare in recent times, completely due to the congestion of spot goods. However, because the sellers were too strong, the long side turned short again. In the afternoon, the recovery wind suddenly started, breaking out of 6 yuan, and rushing out of 7 yuan. Because the recovery wind was too strong, it caused some people to go short again, breaking 7 yuan again. Because the long and short sides are fighting each other, it may be difficult to stabilize for a while, or there will be a recovery wind first. Yesterday morning, Xinhua Runde Shenxing bought in, while Zhongfu Xie Kang Heng Kang and Defu sold very actively. The high price of Type C was 7.4 yuan, and it was immediately unable to support it. It broke 7 yuan and then broke 6 yuan. The decline was too fierce. In the afternoon, the recovery wind started. Lianhe covered a large amount of short positions, and Xinhua Tongshun also absorbed them. Type C opened at 6 yuan, and the trend continued to rise, and rushed out of 7 yuan. Later, because Lianyi Tongkang Hongda Dechang sold in succession, it broke 7 yuan again. Only Type E was the most solid. As a result, they all continued to be slightly 2 cents to 1 yuan small, with about 3 million yuan in transactions. Here is a brief table below.

Stock trading, 100 shares of Xinxin Company were traded, the price being 55 yuan.

### Sugar Market Tension Unabated

The trend of the sugar market has not relaxed. The company's futures are still suspended. The association's quota for existing coarse white goods in the market is 261 yuan to 256 yuan, 253 yuan for November imports, 255 yuan to 253 yuan, 252 yuan for September, 254 yuan to 253 yuan, 250 yuan for August, 252 yuan to 250 yuan, 248 yuan for July, up 2 yuan to 4 yuan. Hong Kong coarse is 230 yuan to 235 yuan, 237 yuan, again to 230 yuan, unchanged. Dutch red is 225 yuan to 230 yuan, 233 yuan, 234.5 yuan, up 15.5 yuan. Taikoo Che Bai B Mark is 260 yuan, up 16 yuan. DY Mark is 240 yuan. HX Mark is 235 yuan to 238 yuan, 240 yuan up 5 yuan.

There will be two interludes before the game: the first match is Huainan re-engaging Nanyang, and the second is a performance match between actors and opera singers. The latter boasts many famous performers, with the addition of Lu Dazhen from Paramount and former Hualian star Xu Zhaoxiong. The actors include the three musketeers Shu Shi, Mei Xi, and Liu Qiong, plus Wang Xuewu and Zha Ruigen, making for a very strong lineup. The female star Zhou Xuan will perform the tip-off finale. In their previous encounter, the Blue and White team played extremely well, ultimately winning 50 to 42 with their determination and fighting spirit. Paramount, the basketball king of Shanghai, is still strong. In the first game, they were still leading 22 to 18 in the first half, but ultimately the Blue and White team caught up and reversed the defeat. Today's victory or defeat is a matter of life or death. Paramount will also fight with its back to the wall in order to seek revenge.

### Is the Purpose of Life to be a Slave?

— Chen Zufang

A while ago, this magazine published an article on the life philosophy of a "good mother," which roughly said that a lively girl became a "typical mother" and sacrificed everything for her children. Her classmates once said to her: "Perhaps you find joy in it, but my impression of you is that it's too much of a pity. You are depriving yourself of everything limitlessly for your children. Please remember that you are not just a 'mother' but also a 'person'! You still have your future!" "Why do you like being a slave to your children? That's what Hitler's followers do."

She had also considered these words, but she did not think of herself as a follower of Hitler, and she expressed her philosophy of life! "The first chapter of the life textbook should be 'The Study of Slavery'."

What a great spirit this is! It is greater than "service," it is the spirit of dedication until death. But people will not easily be willing to be slaves, we may as well think further, is the purpose of life really to be a slave?

The author said that people who have achieved something in their careers must have been slaves to something concrete or abstract: "Medical scientists are slaves to bacteria and pathology," "Literary figures are slaves to 'rhetoric'," "At the same time, a clear pair of lovers are each other's slaves."

The author's spirit of willingness to sacrifice is admirable. She expressed her unwillingness to "enjoy laziness" and believed that being a slave to her children was an honor. But we know that things are often off by a hair's breadth, and the results are off by a thousand miles.

Do medical scientists really want to be slaves to bacteria and pathology? No, absolutely not; they want to conquer bacteria; use bacteria and pathology as tools; but the purpose is to seek the happiness of all mankind; they enslave bacteria and pathology, not become their slaves.

Are writers really slaves to "rhetoric"? No, they are not "literature for the sake of literature"; writers are "people," not "supermen"; they enslave literature and contribute to all mankind. Those who are merely slaves to "rhetoric" cannot be called "writers," they are just pitiful "literary slaves."

As for saying that scientists are "slaves to 'induction' and 'electricity'," please see, in the electrical world of the twentieth century, which electrical invention was not for the purpose of seeking happiness for people? Scientists do not "invent for the sake of invention, or for the sake of electricity."

Furthermore, to say that lovers are each other's slaves is, in other words, to be slaves to love. Isn't this the doctrine of love above all else? To be honest, love that requires each other to be slaves is false. Lovers are also companions on the journey of life. They have common life goals, common careers, and common ideals; on the journey of life, they help each other and encourage each other; when someone wants to enslave someone else, love has reached the point of bankruptcy.

Similarly, "mothers" have responsibilities to the family, just like "fathers" (of course, no one can admit that a man, when married, has children, should stay at home and be a "father" all day), in addition to being a "mother," she is also a citizen of the country and a member of society; if she has the right to be nurtured by the country and society, she has the responsibility to silently contribute her life to the society and the country. Being a parent is only a part of life's responsibilities, and being only a slave to the child is not enough to account for this life. Moreover, the responsibility of parents to their children is not to be "slaves," is it?

In short, in the world of "people," no one should be anyone else's slave; even less should we be slaves to things. Parents have a great responsibility to their children, but their responsibility is not limited to this, because at the same time, they are "citizens," they are "people"!

### Toad

— Zhu Yu

The Seventh Interpretation of Ai Zi

As the saying goes: "If you do nothing wrong in the daytime, you won't be startled by a knock on the door in the middle of the night." In other words, if you have done something wrong, even if you have the ability to change the world, you will still be uneasy. It is because you fear that what you have done (no matter how long ago) will be exposed and you will not be able to escape the law. Here is an example.

Ai Zi decided to take a sea trip one day. Because he was so engrossed in the trip, he forgot the coming of night and had to spend the night on an island. He was awakened in the middle of the night by a series of cries. He thought to himself, "How could there be someone crying on a deserted island? Is it a ghost? I'll have to ask about it!" However, the ghost did not appear, because the cries came from the water. Ai Zi, who was extremely curious, climbed to the shore to find out. At first, there were only faint cries, but later the sound of talking reached Ai Zi's ears. It was like this:

The first one said: "Alas, it's really bad luck, how could the Dragon King know our secret? He issued an order yesterday saying: All aquatic creatures with tails will be beheaded. You think, I am a turtle, clearly carrying such a ghostly tail, tomorrow is my death date, I am really heartbroken!"

The second one continued crying in a rather pitiful way.

"I really don't understand," the first one said again, "You are a toad without a tail, it's not your turn to die, why are you crying?"

The second one sobbed as he replied: "Brother Turtle, what you say is true. But, if the old Dragon King finds out that I used to have a tail in my tadpole days, wouldn't I still be a ghost under the knife tomorrow?"

"Alas, that's hard to say, who told you to be like that in the past? Our behavior of growing tails is really too bad, who knew that you were of the same kind as us in the past."

A big wave washed everything away.

Ai Zi retreated to his lodging and said to himself: "There is no turning back from doing evil deeds, because the laws of nature are clear."

### Gun-Shaped Camera

— Yong Yun

Now there is a gun stock-shaped frame that can be attached to the camera. When taking pictures, the gun stock is supported on the shoulder, and after aiming at the scenery with your eyes, you pull the trigger with your hand. With a click, the scenery is captured in the lens. With the United States gearing up for war, everything is tinged with the color of war, and the gun-shaped camera is just one example.

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fourteen A Hero's Life

However, Autumn Begonia never asked which hotel he was staying at, because he knew very well that this time Autumn Begonia would definitely not go to the Cangzhou Hotel or Yipinxian Restaurant again.

Autumn Begonia originally did not want to accept all his kindness, but before he came, he remembered very clearly that the landlady of that small inn walked into the room with a fake smile on her face and had been flirting for a while.

"It's a pity that your girl can't speak the southern language, otherwise, with his looks, would you be afraid of not having food to eat?" The gossipy landlady had said this several times.

Autumn Begonia himself was a veteran of the world, how could he not understand the meaning of what she said? Therefore, he decided to do his best to take on the burden of maintaining life, and he did not want the landlady to have the opportunity to seduce his daughter, so even though he felt extremely dissatisfied with the twenty yuan that his old friend Hou had given him, he still had to force himself to accept it.

However, how many days can twenty yuan last? (243)

### Anecdotes from Feilian Hall Drama (Part 1)

— Que Wei

Shanghai opera, since the Golden and Great Stage scrambled to invite famous actors, is equally matched and evenly matched. The author has always been a fan of opera, running between the two, often happy to listen carefully to the same repertoire and compare it. Occasionally, I reminisce, and the wonderful interest is born. I will describe one or two to share with those who have the same hobby.

What I want to criticize and compare is the entire "Fourth Son Visits His Mother." Tan Fuying's Fourth Son, in the "Sitting in the Palace" section, only gets a full house of applause for his self-reflection and self-sighing sentences. After a bloody battle, the "Zhuang Er Liu" part, because of his calm enunciation and short, abrupt final words, the old Tan style is not fancy, and it is difficult to cater to Shanghai people's preferences. He changed "Awa" to "son" in his dialogue, which I very much agree with. The allegro is too fast, and the connection is also fast, so you can't hear the benefits. He still uses a falsetto to call Xiaofan, and he omits the word "Xiao", turning it into "call Fan", which should be improved. I remember when Tan Fuying was performing at the Golden Stage in the past, Tan Xiaopei supervised Fuying every day to use his real voice to call Xiaofan. As a result, he called it a few times, and no one time did he get the "Fan" character right, and he stopped with concern. The reason is that the "Fan" character is an open mouth sound (the upper teeth must say goodbye to the lower lip when pronouncing the word). No amount of skill can make the "Fan" character longer with a real sound. It is better to use a falsetto, which can borrow the two sounds of the nose and palate to lengthen the "Fan" character. When he was captured, he threw himself down in the center of the stage, without rolling, and the posture was very beautiful. The "Fifteen Springs Apart from My Brothers" section is the most wonderful, presumably Zong Bao's father-in-law was sitting nearby, and he had to show great power. The "Old Mother" section is also good, and his hair-flinging skills have made great progress. When he was ordered to be beheaded, he jumped up from the air, not lying, at least a foot high, plus the left and right turns, which cannot be done without a solid martial arts foundation. Fuying took the opportunity to pull the cushion straight back from behind his buttocks every time he stood up, which felt crisp and clean, unlike other actors.

### Silver Screen Kaleidoscope

— Worry-Free

"Confucius" is a successful work by Minhua, and it is very popular in Shanghai, but in Southeast Asia, business is sluggish. The reason is the low level of culture, so this failure is a glorious failure.

Wu Cun is making films in Batavia, with a monthly salary of eight hundred shields. It is said that he can save three or four thousand yuan in legal tender after expenses, but he feels that the local Chinese compatriots have too low a cultural level to develop, and he still intends to return to Shanghai within the year.

Jin Yan will co-star with Violet in "Peach Blossom Robbery" in Hong Kong. He was originally scheduled to star in "New Life" for the Nanyang Company, but because of disagreements, he would rather sacrifice a huge salary. It is rare among actors that he values fame over profit.

After Bai Yang followed Gao Zhanfei to Hong Kong, she co-starred in "Eternal Fame," directed by Cai Chusheng, with Feng Zi and Rong Xiaoyi for Daguan Company.

Lan Lan has been rumored for a long time to open a coffee shop, but she has not been able to find a suitable venue for a while, and it is still a pie in the sky, but the name has been decided as "Lan Lan's Coffee Shop."

The Lianxing Company, initiated by Mei Xi and others, has reportedly purchased "St. George's Garden" as a photography studio. Their maiden work is "Spring River Flower Moon Night," directed by Mei himself, and co-starring with Zhou Manhua.

Jinshan and Wang Ying are a pair of silver screen lovers who have been living together without a marriage ceremony. They recently returned to Hong Kong to co-star in "Fifty Years of China and Japan" for Daguan Company, which is a meaningful national defense film.

### Liyuan Miscellany

— Cun Ren

Cheng Yanqiu and Yu Zhenfei only collaborated on two plays, "The Case of Selling Horses" and "The Legend of Hongfu." Although Zhenfei did not perform every night, the Golden Theater paid him a monthly fee to show their excellence. In addition, the theater specially added several sets of scenery for Yanqiu's play "Daughter's Heart," which are now ready and will be staged within the next week.

The ending of Wang Xichun's love is a matter of great concern to opera fans. According to her mother, she hopes that Xichun will make more progress in art, and that love is still the second most important thing in life. As for the Common Stage, after Jin Suwen stopped performing, Wang was hired to take her place, which is still under discussion.

After the Yifeng Society was disbanded, the female Dan Jiang Yunxia recently performed in Suzhou and will soon return to Shanghai to perform at the Paradise Theater. Han Suqiu's one-month term has expired and will not be renewed.

Zhang Wenjuan is still living in Shanghai. Her voice has recovered after losing its luster. Recently, her father said that she will still go north, or go to a theater in Tianjin to perform.

### Blood Rain in the Garden

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 18: Swearing to Sweep Away the Huns, Regardless of Self

Seeing that Liu Zongmin was indeed brave and fierce, he took out a sleeve arrow, held it in his hand, waiting for an opportunity to release it. Just as Zhang Cangqiu's saber missed, his body lunged forward. Liu Zongmin raised his large saber, intending to chop down at his back, when Chen Fei urgently released an arrow, hitting Liu Zongmin's right shoulder. A burst of pain caused him to immediately drag his saber and flee. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei galloped after him. The government troops under their command took advantage of the momentum to cover and kill, and many rebels died on the battlefield. At this critical moment, Li Yan led troops to arrive, the sound of drums and gongs greatly震, rebels swarming from all over the mountains and fields. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei fought for a while, having already achieved victory, but fearing that they would be surrounded due to their fewer troops, they withdrew their troops and retreated slowly. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei covered the rear, advancing slowly, dignified as heavenly gods. The rebels were busy collecting their defeated and残, and did not dare to pursue further. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei withdrew to Shanhaiguan, presenting the captured military equipment, horses, and heads. Wu Sangui ordered a reward. Xu Jing and Liu Yingying were delighted to hear that Zhang and Chen had ambushed and defeated the rebels. They still hoped that when the rebels arrived, they could have a great battle at Jiukou. Wu Sangui immediately ordered Ma Bao's army and Bai Xianzong's army to be divided into left and right wings, stationed at Jiukou, forming a jagged position with Shanhaiguan, waiting specifically for the rebels to arrive and engage in battle. In his heart, he was constantly worried about Yuan Yuan, wishing he had wings to fly to Beiping and rescue Yuan Yuan, but he lamented that he had no ancient escorts to send. Therefore, he was depressed. He knew that among the guards, Bai Twelve's martial arts were the best, and he also had light body skills. He summoned Bai Twelve into the room and said to him, "As you know, my most beloved is my concubine Chen Yuanyuan. It was rare for Tian Hongyu to give her to me, this is something that is hard to come by. (199)
