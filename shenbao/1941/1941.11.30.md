### Seeking Lasting Pacific Peace, U.S. Position Unwavering: Believes Japan's Actions Are Identical to Hitler's; No Compromise Unless Japanese Troops Withdraw from China and Vietnam

United Press International, Washington, 29th—Yesterday, the United States strongly adopted an unshakeable position regarding the sharp crisis in the Far East, insisting on maintaining the status quo and eliminating Japan's influence in China and Vietnam. The most reliable political figures say that the continuation of peace in the Pacific depends entirely on whether Japan can accept the United States' guidance at the final moment to achieve this process. The highest levels of government state that regarding the China issue, there is absolutely no room for compromise. This move shatters Japan's hopes of establishing a temporary agreement, maintaining its current gains, and guaranteeing no new aggression. At the same time, President Roosevelt stated that the Japanese envoy Kurusu has not yet brought Tokyo's reply regarding the United States' position on the Pacific. Senior government officials are comparing Japan's current actions in the Far East with those of the German army in invading countries such as Romania and Hungary before attacking Greece. These officials say that the United States is still willing to prove that the goal of the Japanese military's actions is not to do so, so that the door to further negotiations remains open. President Roosevelt indicated that he might meet with the Japanese envoys again, but said he had no definite appointment date. It is widely believed that the US government believes that a Japanese invasion of Thailand or Yunnan-Burma Road would pose two threats to the United States: it would threaten the source of key raw materials and threaten President Roosevelt's lend-lease policy to China. Well-informed sources say that the lend-lease policy will definitely be implemented, even if it means resorting to force. They point out that President Roosevelt, in his recent speech, guaranteed to deliver raw materials to China and Britain, and it is widely believed that his speech had no reservations. According to the most reliable information obtained yesterday, whether peace can continue in the Pacific depends on whether Japan can agree to the United States' advice at the final moment to withdraw all troops from China and temporarily maintain the status quo in other parts of the Far East. However, the most reliable sources say that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull are still seeking a so-called temporary maintenance of the status quo. These officials also say that this matter does not affect the United States' fundamental policy towards China and Vietnam, and that the United States insists that Japan must immediately cease its aggression against China and other Far Eastern countries, and there is absolutely no room for compromise on this point. What will Tokyo's response be to the strong notification from the United States? This is being awaited here, but it is not known whether the wording of Tokyo's reply will leave room for further negotiations, or whether Japan will proceed with its long-planned further aggression. They also say that, studied from a map, the current situation of Japan's invasion of China and Vietnam already threatens the Philippines and other Far Eastern interests of the United States. The threat of Japan's southward advance to the Philippines is tantamount to completing its horseshoe-shaped encirclement of the Philippines. It is indicated here that the United States is determined to resist this threat, but the decision on war or peace rests with Tokyo. Since April of this year, the United States has drafted a framework for a peaceful resolution, which includes the restoration of normal economic relations in the Far East if the Sino-Japanese war can be resolved fairly, and all countries will have the right to obtain raw materials. It is said that Secretary of State Hull is conducting negotiations with a patient attitude, but Japan is sending an expeditionary force to Vietnam at this time, which makes US officials feel deeply that Japan's method is parallel and similar to that previously adopted by Hitler. The continuous entry of Japanese troops into Vietnam is no different from the previous actions of the Nazis in occupying Czechoslovakia and other European countries. Senior officials also say that Japan's military horseshoe shape surrounds the Philippines, and the United States has to recognize that Japan's invasion of Vietnam and other Far Eastern countries is a direct threat to the United States' territorial interests, not only to the Philippines, but also to the entire Pacific.

Reuters, Washington, 29th—"The Baltimore Sun" has the words that the American people must prepare for war with Japan. Today's Washington sentiment can indeed be fully summarized by this sentence. However, this is also like President Roosevelt's answer yesterday when a reporter asked whether the situation in the Pacific would worsen: it is a question that Japan should answer. Whether Japan will go to war with the United States is determined only by Tokyo. Currently, Japan has three possible paths: agree to the key points of the United States' long-standing position in the East; remain hesitant and uncertain while economic restrictions weaken its strength; make a desperate struggle. The Washington Post says that Kurusu's mission is to see if the United States is bluffing. Key figures in Washington have now made it clear that the United States does not want to change its position on China in the slightest. Non-official observers with experience in the Far East here mostly hold the view that the Japanese warlords cannot withdraw from China while still holding great power in Japan, nor can they remain inactive, causing Japan to fall into bankruptcy due to economic restrictions. To speculate, they would rather fail honorably at the hands of the United States and others, so that they can still maintain their political power at home.

### Sharp Increase in Japanese Troops in Vietnam; Extreme Anxiety in Thailand

Reuters, Singapore, 29th—Reuters has learned from extremely reliable sources that, according to reports received, the reinforcement of Japanese troops landing in Vietnam in the past few days is a sign that Secretary of State Hull has suspended the Washington talks. This reinforcement of Japanese troops is mainly composed of aircraft, and there are also a number of infantry and artillery units that have recently landed in Saigon. However, it is still doubtful whether the exact number of Japanese troops in Vietnam today has exceeded 50,000 or 60,000. About a month ago, Japan had only about 100 aircraft in Vietnam. It is widely believed that in recent days, the number of aircraft has increased to at least 500. Most parts of Vietnam were still waterlogged a month ago, but after the monsoon rains stopped, the Japanese have hired a large number of Vietnamese workers to improve and expand the airport sites. Well-informed sources here still feel that Japan has not yet reached the stage of taking immediate action against Thailand, but its preparations seem to be quite advanced at present. If a lightning offensive by land, sea, and air and the fifth column is decided to be launched against Bangkok, the date will not be far off. The Japanese only need to continue to send a small number of aircraft and troops and transfer warships from Hainan Island to the Gulf of Siam to launch a surprise attack, which is enough to give Bangkok a fatal blow. However, conquering or occupying the interior of Thailand will be another matter. The interior of Thailand is full of mountains and dense forests. The troops required for the Japanese to carry out this military operation may be greatly increased compared to those currently prepared across the border. However, on the Japanese side, they may think that before the ABCD countries decide what action to take and before the naval reinforcements promised by the British Prime Minister can arrive in large numbers, a rapid attack on Bangkok will also be a necessary means to seize the essence of Thailand. This possibility cannot be ruled out, so there is reason to believe that the Japanese military will think that if they take the above-mentioned strategy with rapid and effective means, they may be able to avoid military disputes with the ABCD countries.

Havas News Agency, New York, 29th—According to reports from the United Kingdom, the Thai government has sent a military delegation to Singapore to hold a meeting with the British authorities there.

Reuters, Hanoi, 29th—Japanese dignitaries in Vietnam all say that whether the tense situation in the Far East can be eased depends entirely on the outcome of the Washington conference. Many parties here believe that the situation has reached the most serious point, so they are paying great attention to the news coming from Washington. The non-official information from New York that the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Vietnam is the main position of the United States is published in large characters in Vietnamese newspapers, and readers are temporarily relieved. However, seeing that the Japanese preparations in Vietnam continue unabated, they feel that Japan may not be willing to accept this request. Although some well-informed people believe that Japan does not have the spare strength to launch a major foreign war, the value of the Thai army is a complete mystery. It is only known that the Thai army has some new equipment. The Japanese army has been at war for a long time and is facing a terrain extremely favorable for attack. The outcome is not difficult to predict. And the United Kingdom and the United States have not yet given Thailand a special military guarantee to back up Thailand when it is invaded by a third country. People here cannot help but be surprised. Is it that the ABCD powers are only satisfied with preserving their own final defense line, and the invasion of Thailand may not be a sign of a major war? It is expected that the only effective weapon given to Thailand by the democratic countries is aircraft. Thailand may be able to win with this, because it is said that the aircraft in the ABCD Far East defense are indeed superior to the Japanese aircraft. As for Vietnam, it is heard that it will remain neutral in the Far East war, but since one of the belligerent countries has taken Vietnam as its starting point for operations, it goes without saying that neutrality cannot protect Vietnamese industries.

### Determined to Resist Aggression, Australia and Burma Are Prepared for Any Eventuality

United Press International, New York, 29th—CBS learned from Australian broadcasting yesterday that the Australian War Advisory Committee, after studying diplomatic intelligence from Washington, Tokyo, and London, has approved Prime Minister Curtin's proposed declaration of Australian war policy. It is understood that Curtin's statement is consistent with the previous declaration of Pacific policy. According to the previous statement, it is solemnly pointed out that Australia is extremely willing to maintain peace, but the country will also resist aggression, and its self-defense strength is also very strong.

Reuters, Rangoon, 29th—Today, the Governor of Burma issued a proclamation authorizing the Commander-in-Chief of the Burmese Army to command the Burmese Border Force in order to achieve the effect of unified command. It is generally believed that this measure is an important step in Burma's preparations to resist aggression. The Burmese Border Force has many regiments, all of whom have received excellent training in border military operations and have excellent service records. The ground defense of various airports in Burma is actually the responsibility of the army. The Burmese government also announced its decision to establish an organization based on the whole of Burma, with full power to obtain the main food supply and control its distribution. The detailed measures are currently being drafted urgently.

### Britain and the United States Economically Restricting Japan, Will Implement a Comprehensive Blockade

Reuters, London, 29th—The Times correspondent in Washington discussed the recent developments in US-Japan relations, saying that the current question is whether Japan intends to attack Thailand or Yunnan Province, or both. Some people in Washington believe that if Japan has this intention, its reply to the US document on Wednesday evening may be delayed until the military action is already underway. At the same time, another part of the people say that the current economic restrictions on Japan may be immediately expanded into a comprehensive economic blockade, and no advance warning will be given. If the final provocation is indeed added to the United States, it can be asserted that it will be accepted, because any other approach will not only affect the Pacific, but also Europe. The American people, even those in the Midwest states, will be deeply shocked if they see that the country they currently deeply suspect is now allowed to get its way.

### Germany Promises Military Assistance; Japan Expects Something

United Press International, Washington, 29th—Senator Gillette, a Democrat from Ottawa, Idaho, said today that he had learned from reliable non-official sources that Hitler had promised to provide Japan with huge military assistance in February of next year, and that by January of next year, Vichy would be forced to hand over its fleet to Japan. These officials also said that Japan hopes that the Soviet war will end soon. Gillette believes that US-Japan negotiations are unlikely to reach an agreement except perhaps to establish a delayed truce. Gillette said that Kurusu's visit to the United States was to delay waiting for German assistance for Japan to attack Thailand and the Yunnan-Burma Road.

Reuters, Tokyo, 29th—When local authorities commented on rumors that the United States had decided to set up aerial patrols in the airspace over the Burma Road, they said that this action would be considered a direct hostile act and one of the most provocative armed aggressions on the part of the ABCD front. The Japan Advertiser also commented on the claim that democratic countries had notified Thailand to protect its neutrality, saying that if the meaning of this move is to send occupying forces into Thailand, it will create a very serious situation.

### British Sea Minister Warns Japan It Is Not Too Late to Turn Back from the Brink

Reuters, Blackpool, 29th—Sea Minister Alexander mentioned the Pacific issue in a speech at the opening ceremony of Blackpool Warship Week today, saying that in the Far East, we are witnessing Japan, an old ally, now hovering on the edge of making a big mistake if it takes a wrong step. Japanese leaders have often claimed that the country is now at a crossroads, but who has led it to this position? The goodwill and cooperation of the United States and us are always listening to Japan's dispatch along the road of reason and peace. In fact, it is its warlords who have led Japan to its current predicament. I believe that many wise men in Japan can see the advantages and disadvantages, and I believe that some of its leaders will give wise advice and will not bear to let it fall into the abyss. If Japan is prepared to cooperate with the forces of justice and reason, then no one can doubt that a great and glorious destiny is waiting to come to it in East Asia. Alexander also said that what Japan can expect from Hitler is nothing other than what Italy has encountered. Hitler will use Japan to advance his evil plans, and once the goal is achieved, he will abandon it regardless. Alexander finally said that the British Navy has repeatedly broken the enemy's prestige at sea in order to enable large-scale troops to be equipped and supplied for thousands of miles of transportation by sea, and its achievements are still indelible.

### Roosevelt Calls National Defense Leaders to Discuss How to Deal with the Far East Incident; US Ships in the Pacific Are Temporarily Not Armed

Reuters, Washington, 29th—Before President Roosevelt went to the hot springs for his weekend vacation yesterday, he reviewed the government's proposed measures for dealing with any unexpected events in the Far East with national defense leaders. President Roosevelt's intimates were Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of the Army Stimson, Army Chief of Staff Marshall, and Navy Chief of Staff Stark. Secretary of State Hull also visited the President.

Reuters, Washington, 29th—It is learned from reliable sources that the United States has indeed eliminated the possibility of compromise with Japan on the China issue, and then the issue of arming US ships in the Pacific has arisen. The White House said yesterday that US ships in the Pacific will not be armed in the current environment. President Roosevelt said at a press conference, in response to a question on how long the current environment can be maintained, that the question should be answered by Tokyo. The President also said that negotiations with Japan have not broken down, but he may leave the hot springs before Monday due to the Japanese situation. Most of the news about the negotiations comes from Tokyo, because the US policy is extremely patient. The President also said that US ships sailing to Spain, Portugal and its nearby islands, and Central and South America do not intend to be armed.

### Generalissimo Chiang Sent a Note to the United States, Explaining the Necessity of Aiding China

### The Tone of the Eastern Newspaper Shows Pessimism; The Attitude of the United States Is Firm; Negotiations Are Difficult to Achieve

United Press International, Tokyo, 29th—Japanese newspapers today continued to express pessimism about the Washington talks, which were temporarily suspended to await Japan's reply to the United States. "Asahi Shimbun" said in a special editorial that negotiations cannot be successful unless the United States abandons its basic principles, and stated that negotiations must be based on reality. At the same time, the newspaper published on the cover a photo of the Japanese fleet issued by the Naval Inspection Department. The purpose of publishing the photo was to show that the Japanese Navy can absolutely protect the Pacific. "Asahi Shimbun" also said that Japan will still do its utmost "until the very last minute" to maintain peace in the Pacific. The newspaper concluded, "The environment around Japan has become so tense that Japan is unwilling to waste any more time on negotiations." "Mainichi Shimbun" said that if the United States is overly confident in its national strength and insists that Japan accept its views, "then Japan will have to suspend the current negotiations and take the necessary steps as soon as possible."

### Japanese Residents in New York Prepare to Withdraw Completely; Japanese Banks and Companies Have Stopped Doing Business One After Another

United Press International, Tokyo, 29th—"Asahi Shimbun" recently published a telegram from a correspondent in New York saying that the US-Japan relations are serious. The Japanese residents who were affected by the freezing order and remained decided to leave the United States and will return home by ship on December 14. All Japanese banks and companies in New York will only leave one or two responsible personnel. All Japanese clubs and societies in the area will be closed.

Reuters, New York, 29th—Reuters learned from Japanese leaders that Japanese banks in New York intend to close down. They are now preparing to transfer their remaining business to Yokohama Specie Bank, which will be left here alone. At this time, the New York managers of various Japanese banks are just as unsure of the final outcome of the current tense situation between the United States and Japan as others. A manager told people that he was afraid to read the newspaper. The first to plan to stop business is Mitsui Bank, and at least four others will follow suit. Of course, the closure of Japanese banks is in line with the tense stage of US-Japan talks.

### British Prime Minister Churchill's Sixtieth Birthday

Reuters, London, 29th—Sunday is British Prime Minister Churchill's sixty-seventh birthday, but no ceremonies are planned for that day. The Prime Minister has only decided to have a small gathering with his family. At that time, his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren will go to the Prime Minister's residence to celebrate his birthday. The Prime Minister will take the time on that day to draft his speech on the issue of manpower. This speech will be delivered when the government proposes the first bill in British history to recruit women.

### U.S. Government Issues Statement Condemning Finland

Havas News Agency, Washington, 28th—The State Department recently issued a communiqué saying, "We fear that Finland's cooperation with the German army has been confirmed by the country's recent actions. Since Finland's government refused to accept the US proposal to immediately cease hostilities against the Soviet Union, none of its actions have been insufficient to explain the country's position."

### Earthquake in India; Wind Disaster in Japan

Reuters, Bombay, 29th—It is heard that there was a violent earthquake in North Shawara, Rawalpindi, and Srinagar last night, lasting for several seconds. Residents of North Shawara were extremely panicked and fled to open ground. There is no damage or death

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 29th—A hurricane swept through central Japan, lasting for about twenty minutes before and after.

According to the report released on Friday, twenty-two houses were completely destroyed and more than two hundred were partially destroyed.

### British Troops Occupy Gondar; East African Italian Empire Collapses; The Number of Blackshirts Who Surrendered Is Difficult to Estimate; The Red Sea Passage Is More Stable From Now On

United Press International, London, 29th—British troops occupied Gondar yesterday. This British victory completely disintegrated the East African Empire created by Mussolini. In addition, the British army has lifted any threats to the British army's positions in Egypt and Sudan and its rear, and the situation of the Red Sea passage, the necessary route for American supplies to the Middle East, is becoming more stable.

Reuters, London, 29th—The War Office issued a statement on the Gondar campaign, stating that the military operation in Gondar was of a blocking nature, and the patriotic soldiers led by British officers undertook a large part of the mission. There were few large-scale battles, but the patrols were quite active, driving the enemy into a more and more narrow area and forcing them to surrender. On November 20, the area occupied by the troops under Italian General Vassi was still sixteen miles long from north to south and forty miles wide from east to west, but he had withdrawn from Gondar and declared the city an undefended city. The number of Italian troops stationed there who have now surrendered is difficult to estimate, because there are quite a few who have been killed or wounded and have deserted. The Italian army there originally had nine battalions of Blackshirts, the 4th Brigade of the Colonial Army, and a part of the 22nd Brigade of the Colonial Army. General Vassi's air force had only one fighter and one bomber left. The South African Air Force was responsible for assisting in the battle throughout the campaign. The British commander of Gondar is Major General Fox, 46 years old.

### Reports to Various Government Ministries: Matters Requiring Attention from the Political Council (Continued from Yesterday)

Internal Affairs

The powers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs seem inadequate, making active management difficult. It is proposed that the government consider increasing the powers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Furthermore, all matters of an internal affairs nature should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The financial and human resources of the counties are insufficient, making it difficult to implement the new county system with six or seven departments uniformly established. When approving the organization of each county, the Ministry of Internal Affairs should pay close attention. The selection of township and village heads, as well as heads of Baojia (local security units), is often unqualified. County governments should be ordered to carefully select and appoint qualified individuals. The concurrent appointment of unqualified township heads as elementary school principals has a very negative impact on education. The regulation requiring concurrent appointments need not be strictly adhered to. The relationship between the police and the people is the closest. Special attention should be paid to moral education, "understanding propriety, righteousness, and integrity, bearing responsibility, and observing discipline," in order to reform the police administration. Each county should strictly order local governments to expand warehouses and effectively manage accumulated grain reserves. The opium ban has reached the final prohibition stage. Existing anti-smoking agencies should be strengthened, funding should be increased, rewards and punishments should be strictly enforced, and the ban should be thoroughly and completely implemented in accordance with the original plan.

Finance

Regarding the state of revenues and expenditures, efforts should be made to seek a balance. When opening up new sources of revenue, close attention should be paid to whether the increased taxes hinder production or affect the minimum living standards of the people. Whether the tax revenue expenses, including anti-smuggling administrative costs, are too large, thereby reducing income. Revenue should be collected according to the principle of "those with more money contribute more," and fair collection policies should be sought to remedy financial difficulties. The government should pay more attention to cost-cutting measures, and stop things that have little effect and are not needed. Unnecessary agencies should be abolished as much as possible. All expenditures, whether central or local, should be based on the principle of having a significant impact on the war effort. Reforming the tax system, adopting a monopoly system, and issuing public bonds for goods must have appropriate institutions and personnel to cooperate in order to be effective. Budget preparation is the foundation of finance, and implementing the budget is the first condition for sound finances. The Ministry of Finance should, based on the first principle of the war effort, take on the responsibility of preparing and executing the budget. Regarding the control of finance, the current foreign exchange control situation has obviously improved compared to the past, but efforts are still needed to eliminate the black market. Regarding foreign exchange requests, whether for the government or merchants, a policy should be established and standards should be strictly defined. With regard to bank lending, policies should be determined, and the use and transfer of idle funds should be reasonably regulated.

Transportation

In recent years, telecommunications construction has made considerable progress. Wireless communication equipment should be strengthened as soon as possible to facilitate communication. Civil aviation should be expanded to facilitate travel. Special attention should be paid to safety and management to increase transport effectiveness. In the future, postal transportation services in various locations should be concentrated on automobiles as much as possible. For routes where transportation is inadequate and gasoline supply is more difficult, in addition to these issues, how to strive for self-sufficiency in transportation equipment, how to seek convenience in postal and telecommunications, how to fully utilize waterway transportation, and how to accelerate the development of postal savings and remittance are all urgent tasks. It is hoped that the transportation authorities will take immediate action. As for the engineering, transportation, and management aspects of highways, attention should also be paid to improvement. Efforts should be made to increase the number of vehicles, and thorough unity should be sought in terms of management. Start with internal cooperation within the bureau, and extend to other management agencies to achieve unified policies. Severe measures should be taken to curb driver fraud, and a military organizational structure should be implemented. As for cargo inspection, it should be brief and swift. How to divide and improve passenger and freight, and how to promote the use of non-gasoline vehicles such as coal cars, charcoal cars, and tung oil cars, and how to expand the training of drivers and technicians are all urgent tasks at present. It is hoped that these measures will be implemented soon.

Education

The education authorities have been able to diligently advance the facilities and improvements of schools at all levels according to established procedures, which is gratifying. However, the following matters need to be observed and noted: The proportion of education funds in the national general budget is too small. The government should strive to increase it from the 31st year onward under the education funding category, and allocate it strictly to meet actual needs. The implementation of the mutual aid plan for national education over several years, submitted by the government to this council and decided by the Supreme National Defense Council, has recently been rumored to have reduced central subsidies, and there is a tendency to fail to achieve it midway. The government should be requested to implement it earnestly in accordance with the original plan. The treatment of teachers at all levels is meager. During this period of high cost of living, there have been frequent instances of changing professions. Efforts should be made to provide better salaries and subsidies to maintain their livelihoods, so that they can concentrate on their teaching careers. Military training has had little effect since its implementation. The government should be requested to improve it by delineating powers and cultivating teachers. During the five years of war, there has been a lack of domestic materials. In the future, industrial education should be developed in many ways and efforts should be made to enrich it. At the same time, vocational schools should be increased and production education should be earnestly promoted in order to enrich domestic materials and increase combat power. In recent years, unrest has occurred frequently in secondary schools and above. Efforts should be made to correct this to reverse the decline. Township and village heads concurrently serving as principals of national schools are only a temporary expedient. The knowledge and qualifications of the heads of large townships are insufficient to be qualified as principals. Dedicated principals should be the principle. This council also had a resolution at its previous meeting. Improvements should be made as soon as possible in order to complete the national education plan. Private schools often feel that the source of funds is insufficient. The government should provide effective guidance so that they can develop in the same way as public schools.

Economy

In the past year or two, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been engaged in adjusting the provincial enterprises undertaken by various regions to prevent problems before they arise. However, economic facilities must be planned comprehensively with the entire country as the scope to avoid provinces acting on their own and establishing barriers. The industrial and mining enterprises founded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs have made progress in each year. The types, units, and product values have increased annually. In the future, economic facilities should be based on the principle of "building the country through industry" and attention should be paid to the construction of basic industries. It is hoped that the government will find ways to ensure the progress of the industrial and mining production industry. Efforts should be made to improve the technology of exporting minerals to reduce costs. There should also be sound institutions to support this. The management of goods and prices should be reviewed in terms of scope and method. For example, the control of liquid fuels and the supply of cotton yarn and cloth should be made with the greatest effort to regulate the market. The problem of commodity prices should focus on improving transportation, cracking down on hoarding, and adjusting institutions. It is hoped that the government will carefully consider countermeasures to first seek stability and then suppress prices to benefit the people.

Food

It is hoped that the scope of food control will be gradually and strictly defined. Strict plans should be made and carefully implemented for the collection of land taxes, the purchase of military food, the establishment of warehouses, the implementation and management of the county and township grain storage system, and the training of food personnel. As for the operation of general civilian food, it is hoped that it will be given considerable freedom in order to stimulate production and stabilize its prices. When determining the amount of requisition and purchase, attention should be paid to the psychological response of farmers to this policy and the effectiveness of continued production. In addition, attention should be paid to the fairness of the burden when purchasing grain so as to be fair and equitable. The grain purchase area should not be limited to a local area so that only a portion of the people suffer disadvantages. For hoarding food, the location of grain collection, transportation, and public security should be considered so that it can be quickly supplied in times of food shortage. In the past, the management of food in various provinces was often inappropriate. It is hoped that the Ministry of Food will play a supervisory role in promoting grain administration in various provinces. Regarding food control, it is hoped that the construction of warehouses, the strict design of warehouse management such as ventilation, moisture protection, and rat prevention, and the large-scale preparation of gathering points along rivers and highways will all be handled as soon as possible by hiring experts to carefully consider and implement proper measures.

Agriculture and Forestry

Regarding the grain production increase plan, special attention should be paid to grain-deficient areas. Cotton and hemp production are urgently needed for civilian clothing and military uniforms. Large-scale promotion should be carried out to achieve self-sufficiency. Animal husbandry and fish farming are very important for rural economy and national nutrition. They should be earnestly promoted. Agricultural products that can be exchanged for foreign exchange and wartime resources, such as tung oil, tea leaves, pig bristles, silk, camphor, and anise oil, should all be promoted. Regarding the method of breeding cattle, in addition to encouraging people to increase breeding and implementing a loan plan for plowing cattle, the government should set up farms, breed them on a large scale, distribute them for sale in various places, and pay special attention to protecting plowing cattle, banning the slaughter of plowing cattle, and preventing cattle plague. Other matters, such as the promotion of economic forestry farms, in addition to state-owned ones, efforts should still be made to support the development of private forestry farms. In addition to the current methods of agricultural loans, attention should still be paid to providing loans in kind for plowing cattle, agricultural tools, and seeds. (To be continued)

### Key Resolutions of the Provisional Assembly of Fujian

Yongan. The fifth session of the Provisional Assembly of Fujian opened on the 15th of this month. After listening to the provincial government's report, more than 70 proposals were discussed and resolved. The important ones included measures to prevent malpractice and strive for fairness in the conversion of land taxes to payment in kind; county-level finances at all levels should follow budgetary procedures and be made public. Various proposals for the interim measures for food management in the province were thoroughly studied, providing practical methods for adoption and implementation by the standing committee.

### Ma Zhanshan Discusses Recent Situation in Northeast China

Yulin. Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, recently gave a speech to reporters here, saying that the men of the Northeast Volunteer Army have been fighting bitterly for ten years like one day. The Chinese Volunteer Army in various parts of Northeast China is still striking against the Japanese everywhere. Under the iron heels of the Japanese army, the people of Northeast China hope for the National Army like a severe drought hopes for rain clouds. In addition to seizing Chinese resources, the Japanese army has recently forced the conscription of strong men in Northeast China. There are already 2 million Chinese compatriots who have been forcibly conscripted. In order to prevent their rebellion, they are mostly not allowed to fight in Chinese territory and are prepared to advance north or south, fighting against the Soviet Union or the United Kingdom and the United States. However, this kind of plan is just a waste of effort, because the Chinese compatriots in Northeast China are in high spirits, and the Japanese army cannot control them no matter where they are. 28th dispatch

Editorial

### Review of US-Japan Talks Over the Past Two Weeks

President Roosevelt met with the Japanese representative for 45 minutes on the 27th of this month. The following day, he convened a "War Cabinet" meeting at the White House. Afterwards, he went to his Warm Springs, Georgia, retreat for his usual weekend vacation. Before leaving, he told the press that US-Japan negotiations had not broken down, but how long they could continue would have to be asked of Japan. At the same time, the President believed that the key to peace or war in the Pacific rested entirely with Japan. Judging from Roosevelt's departure from Washington, it is clear that the US government is now awaiting Japan's response to Hull's note. Therefore, before Tokyo's formal reply, talks between the two sides have evidently come to a standstill. Looking back from the time Kurusu arrived in Washington to today, it has been exactly half a month. Although we have long asserted that it would be unsuccessful, it has been full of twists and turns. At one point, it even made people suspect that the US might be repeating its old appeasement tune. This doubt was not dispelled until Hull sent a note reiterating a firm stance. At this juncture, when US-Japan talks are hanging by a thread, tracing the diplomatic activities in Washington over the past two weeks may be helpful for observing the overall situation in the future.

In the two weeks after Japanese special envoy Kurusu arrived in the US, representatives from the US and Japan held a total of six meetings. However, in between, the US convened two ABCD group meetings and two "War Cabinet" meetings. This alone is sufficient to fully prove that the US is conducting talks with Japan not solely for its own interests, but representing the entire democratic front in the Far East. While the US government is engaged in diplomatic negotiations, it has by no means neglected the military preparations it should be undertaking. Kurusu arrived in Washington on the 15th of this month, which happened to be a Saturday. It was not until the 17th that he had his first meeting with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, lasting 70 minutes. Subsequently, Kurusu and Nomura held four more talks with Hull on the 18th, 20th, 22nd, and 27th. Among them, the one on the 18th lasted two hours and 45 minutes. It is said that Hull made every effort to persuade Japan to abandon aggression, withdraw from the Axis, and explained the benefits Japan could gain after changing course. The 20th was Thanksgiving, but the two sides continued to meet for one hour. According to news that emerged afterwards, the Japanese side essentially demanded three points: The ABCD alliance must be relaxed; The US must reduce aid to China; The US must stop pressuring Japan's efforts to build a "New Order in East Asia." These three points are equivalent to a restatement of Tojo's three principles. As for the price the Japanese side was willing to pay, it is said there were also three points: Not to cooperate directly with Germany; To stop military threats to the Dutch East Indies and Siberia; To be willing to end the war in China as soon as possible. This is significantly different in degree from the three major principles insisted upon by the US, namely, withdrawing from the Axis, abandoning aggression, and withdrawing troops stationed in China and Vietnam. In particular, the two items of troop withdrawal and withdrawal from the Axis are what the democratic front must fight for. Since the Japanese side's intentions had been fully revealed through the two meetings, Hull convened the first Far East Five-Power Conference on the 22nd. According to what was announced afterwards, the opinions of the participating countries were completely一致, and they were all willing to support the US's position in the talks with Japan. That evening, Hull had another long talk with the Japanese representatives for three hours. On Monday, the 24th, Hull convened the second Five-Power Conference. At this time, all sorts of bizarre rumors arose. Some said that the democratic countries had not reached a consensus, while others said that the US was prepared to sign a temporary agreement with Japan for a period of three months, in order to create a "breathing space" for confrontation in the Pacific. It was also at this time that, on the one hand, the situation on the Moscow front was urgent, and on the other hand, Hitler suddenly convened a meeting of countries that had signed the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact, attempting to counter the diplomatic struggle being waged by Washington. After three or four days of this commotion, the truth finally came to light on the 26th, when President Roosevelt met with Hu Shih and then Hull personally handed Kurusu and Nomura a note containing the basic principles of American diplomacy. The so-called US concessions to Japan turned into the US adhering to its consistent position, and the temporary agreement atmosphere, which had been quite rampant for a time, turned into a situation where US-Japan talks were on the verge of collapse. This situation has been somewhat confirmed by President Roosevelt's departure from Washington for a vacation.

In fact, if people only paid a little attention to the basic positions of the US and Japan, as well as the actual actions of both sides over the past two weeks, it would not be difficult to predict that the final fate of the Washington talks would be failure. It is universally known that Tojo's three principles are difficult to reconcile with Hull's fourteen points. At the same time, Japan's use of negotiation time to continuously increase troops in Vietnam and intensify threats to Thailand is sufficient to reveal that the Tokyo authorities have no sincerity in abandoning aggression. The US's continued strengthening of its military force in the Far East, assisting China in strengthening its border defenses, and even sending troops to Palau to station in the Dutch East Indies, also shows that the Washington authorities will not be fooled by Japan's smokescreen diplomacy. Therefore, looking ahead to the overall situation in the Far East, we believe that unless Tojo knows when to retreat, what will accompany the breakdown of US-Japan talks in the future will be a "showdown" between justice and violence.

### Fierce Tank Battle Between Soviet and German Forces on the Moscow Front; Red Army Launches Fierce Counter-Offensive Using Latest-Type Artillery in the Kalinin Sector

Reuter, Moscow, 29th – The "National Daily" Berlin dispatch states that Soviet troops on the Moscow front are still resisting desperately, just like the Soviet troops around Leningrad. Soviet artillery is constantly firing back at German forces, and the number of Soviet counter-attacks is increasing, the frequency is increasing, and the scope is also larger. According to captured artillery, the Soviet army is now using the latest-type artillery in the Moscow area.

Reuter, London, 29th – German forces on the southern wing of the Moscow front are said to have made new progress, while Soviet forces are launching fierce counter-offensives in the Kalinin sector on the northern wing. According to "Pravda," Soviet forces have broken into German lines and occupied many villages, possibly to relieve the pressure on the Klin and Volokolamsk areas, where the fighting is extremely fierce. Moscow news acknowledges that German forces have made progress south of the Soviet capital, occupying City V in the Stalinogorsk district, but at the cost of at least 2,000 casualties, the loss of 50 artillery pieces, and a large number of weapons. In some locations, Soviet counter-attacks have driven back German forces. The German High Command announced yesterday that German forces had "broken through strong enemy positions" at some point on the Moscow front. German radio broadcasts stated that on the Moscow front, German tanks continue to advance, encountering Soviet tanks that are resisting and counter-attacking, resulting in a major tank battle. As for the southern front, Soviet General Timoshenko is continuing to lead his troops in a successful counter-offensive in the Rostov area. Red Star newspaper reported that Soviet forces yesterday recaptured a city defended by German forces after street fighting. German communiqués also acknowledged that Soviet forces were launching fierce counter-offensives near Rostov and the Donets River. There is very little news about the fighting on the Crimean Peninsula, but Berlin said that "the remnants of two Soviet divisions on the peninsula have been severely battered." "Pravda" also reported progress by Soviet forces on the Leningrad front. Finnish communiqués mentioned fierce attacks by Soviet forces on the Karelian front. Swedish news agency reported that elite Finnish troops attacked the Murmansk railway, destroying a section of track, but Soviet news stated that Finnish forces had been heavily damaged and retreated.

Havas, Berlin, 29th – The German News Agency recently announced that German forces have occupied the Volokolamsk fortress city, a key point on the outer perimeter of Moscow.

Soviet Forces Making Good Progress on Southern Front; Three Elite German Divisions Annihilated

In addition, our forces have destroyed 115 enemy tanks, 1,300 trucks, and 70 artillery pieces. Our forces are currently giving the enemy no chance to breathe and are still advancing.

Random Notes on the European War

### Germany After Two Years of War

The following is a report from Stephen Laird, a reporter for the American "Life" magazine stationed in Berlin:

One day, Führer Hitler was giving a speech. I was sitting in a company car, listening to his speech through hundreds of loudspeakers along the way. I gently patted the driver on the shoulder and said, "What is he saying there?" The driver thought for a moment and replied, "He says we will definitely win." I asked him again, "So what do you think?" He remained silent, and I thought he wouldn't answer. After a while, he calmly replied, "Yes! I thought we had already won. Now I'm hoping for peace to come."

This is what the German people think. However, in Germany under Hitler's rule, the people's feelings are of little importance. They themselves admit this, so when referring to the German government, they often call it "they" instead of "we."

I lived in Germany for seven months, and the attitude of the German people has always been like this, and has not changed--always indifferent, enthusiastically patriotic, working hard, with no time to play. Although the food is rough, it is not lacking. Their government has also undergone some changes. The so-called "National Socialist Revolution" has long since ended. The future trend is showing the shadow of the past--military dictatorship. The power of the party is declining, the national economy is moving towards reaction, and even Hitler himself has changed.

After eight years of earth-shattering achievements, Hitler has proclaimed himself a superman who does not listen to the advice of those inferior to him in status. Anyone who does not please Hitler knows that they can no longer offer any unpleasant suggestions or reports to this dictator. At least four people, who used to be able to see Hitler at any time in case of emergency, told me that they now have to wait several weeks, if at all, to see the Führer. However, during the meeting, Hitler would express his own views endlessly, so that they had no chance to bring up the urgent issues they wanted to raise.

Now no one dares to ask questions in front of Hitler. Several people who often meet with him told me that not only do they have to nod and agree with everything Hitler says, but when they say yes repeatedly, they look up to him as if he were a god. Today, no one dares to say to Hitler: "The German people need peace. They are heartbroken by tightening their belts and extending working hours. They want to relax a little and taste what his promised fruits of victory are like." Today, no one dares to say to him: "Most young Germans hate the government's restraints, and even most Germans in the occupied territories do not feel liberated." When he was speaking to a group of cheering workers in a factory, he didn't know that most of them were party members wearing workers' clothes, and the real workers had been given half a day off. Hitler, however, believed that every German supported him like crazy.

Therefore, when Hitler decided to attack Soviet Russia, not even one general dared to tell him directly that it would take at least three weeks to annihilate the Red Army. German generals all knew that the military strength of Soviet Russia was much stronger than that of any country they had encountered before. Germany also had no pre-prepared "touring party" in Russia, and the Soviet government was not as easy to overthrow as Hitler had imagined. But their previous predictions had never been fulfilled. They had expressed doubts about the advance into the Rhineland, the breakthrough of the Maginot Line, and the collapse of France. Hitler was able to predict things like a god and plan everything without omission. He seemed to be a military genius. So if Hitler said that the Red Army could be defeated in three weeks, then it would be three weeks, and who would dare to say no?

Hitler is no longer just a leader of politics. He is an invincible military victor, and his life is often focused on military affairs. Because of his long-term study of military science, he has been able to deeply understand the secrets of warfare. He is the supreme commander and brilliant military strategist of Germany, and his position is unmatched. In addition to the Army General Staff, he also has his own military staff group, headed by General Alfred Jodl. General Jodl meets with him at least once a day, plans on his behalf based on his opinions, and then submits them to the Army General Staff.

Hitler is extremely pleased with this, because this is what he has always dreamed of. His favorite oil painting is of him in shining armor, sitting on horseback. He attaches great importance to this painting, and it is now hung everywhere throughout the country. Being a great military conqueror is actually much more fun than being a shop owner or a political leader of other failed middle class.

Except for going to the front to supervise the battle, Hitler's daily life is roughly the same in Berchtesgaden and Berlin. He usually goes to bed at two o'clock in the morning and does not get up until eleven o'clock. He actually sleeps only about four hours, and spends most of the rest of his time meditating or reading. According to people who know him, Hitler reads two books a day, mostly specialized books on military equipment or military history. He reads quickly and can remember everything he sees.

Every morning, he usually takes a bath in a green ceramic basin and shaves himself with a gold-plated razor. When he is in Berlin, there is also a barber and manicurist from the barber shop of the Kaiserhof Hotel to serve him. He wears a simple uniform all year round, which he created himself, adopting the style of the National Socialist uniform and changing to the color of the army uniform.

His diet is very simple and very regular. He eats breakfast alone in his bedroom, drinking Chinese tea and eating porridge, toast, butter and jam. Lunch consists of cold salad, eggs, fruit, and non-alcoholic beer. Dinner is roughly the same as lunch, sometimes with soup, rice, or pancakes. The chef who has worked for Hitler for more than a decade is short and fat, named Menanburg. He used to run a restaurant in Berlin and was proficient in cooking Austrian cuisine, especially good at making the pastries that Hitler loved to eat, but Hitler is now setting an example for the people and does not eat much anymore.

The non-alcoholic beer that Hitler drinks is specially made for him by a Munich brewery. Guests can drink whatever wine they like, but they are not allowed to smoke. Hitler considers smoking the most poisonous thing in the world, so he often says that he would rather see his enemies smoking than see his friends smoking. Hitler likes to tell anecdotes about celebrities and imitate other people's actions during meals, which is his unique talent.

When Hitler goes out, he travels in a twin-engine Condor plane, a black Mercedes-Benz limousine, a gray Mercedes-Benz six-wheeled military vehicle, and a special train, which he takes. The planes and vehicles are equipped with wireless radios, and the train has a section equipped with transmitters and receivers to receive news from all over the world.

Hitler's household is managed by three women—Linqi, Cross, and Youngkeff—and the servants are all young married women with children. Hitler is always running around or dictating orders in the reception room during the day, and rarely sees him sitting at his desk. He takes walks as exercise, and fills his pockets with nuts to feed the squirrels. He is an expert at waiting, often lying still for months, planning secretly. Once launched, he becomes tense and excited, as if he is much younger than usual. He is truly as still as a virgin, moving like a fleeing rabbit.

In addition to using war as a game, Hitler has sometimes looked at illustrated magazines from around the world (including Life, which is flown to him by German diplomats), reviewed weekly newsreels, compiled war reports from the General Headquarters, and listened to Wagner records, which he calls the ideal expression of the heyday of Germanism (an opera singer told me that Hitler has listened to this record two hundred times) (To be continued)

### Two US Yangtze Patrol Gunboats Quietly Left Shanghai Last Night; Believed to be Escorting Troop Withdrawal Ships to the Philippines; Rear Admiral Glassford Accompanied on the USS Luzon; Three British Ships All Repainted Gray in Preparation for Evacuation of Nationals

Approximately ten hours after the last batch of US Marines boarded the President Harrison and left Shanghai, the USS Luzon (flagship) and USS Wake gunboats of the US Yangtze Patrol Force quietly left Shanghai from the estuary at 12:15 AM the same night. Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the fleet, also accompanied on the Luzon. The two gunboats are departing China following a recent announcement from Washington.

Escorting Troop Withdrawal Ships to Manila

The only remaining American gunboat in Shanghai is the USS Wake. It is widely believed that the Wake is staying in Shanghai to evacuate US officials if necessary. In other parts of China, only two American gunboats remain: the USS Mindanao, patrolling the Pearl River, and the USS Tutuila, stationed near Chongqing on the Yangtze River. Naval officials are remaining tight-lipped, but well-informed sources believe that the Luzon and Wake will escort the President Madison and President Harrison, which are carrying returning US military personnel and civilians, likely to Manila.

Japanese Ship Izumo Fitted with Special Net

The "Continental Daily News" reports that the Japanese flagship Izumo, docked in front of the NYK company wharf, was quite active the previous day and was fitted with a special net on its side, apparently to protect against magnetic mines. This indicates that the ship will sail out within a few days.

Concordia Medical and Army Medical Staff Evacuating

The "Shanghai Times" reports a Reuters dispatch from Beijing dated the 28th, stating that the American professors and doctors of the Peking Union Medical College will evacuate in early December following evacuation advice from the American Embassy in Beijing. It is also disclosed that the US Marines stationed in Beijing will also depart in early December. American military equipment and munitions were loaded onto trains yesterday and transported to Qinhuangdao, where the US military will board a transport ship to depart.

British Evacuation Ships Ready to Sail

A total of 1,075 British nationals (including women and children) have recently registered with the British Consulate General in Shanghai, preparing to evacuate. Of these, 500 are scheduled to depart Shanghai on the Anhui at 9:00 AM on the 28th, which is currently docked off the Bund outside of the French Concession at the Jardine Matheson wharf. Among the 500 British nationals, 72 came from Tianjin to Shanghai. Also docked near the Anhui are the Ewo vessel Mingsheng and the Taikoo vessel Chongqing. All three ships have been painted gray and the ship names have been removed, so it is generally expected that the other two ships will also transport British nationals from Shanghai for evacuation. The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that British nationals in Shanghai will evacuate to Hong Kong on the Anhui and change ships to Australia. This morning, the British Consul General announced that the luggage of the evacuating British nationals will be allowed to be loaded onto the ship on Tuesday (December 2nd). The previous statement that loading would take place on Monday has been changed. The Anhui is currently docked at the Jardine Matheson wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Passengers are prohibited from boarding until the final notification, and farewells are limited to the wharf area.

### Western Newspaper Reports Over One Hundred Men and Women Arrested

During the arrests, over seventy assorted handguns, approximately five thousand rounds of ammunition, eight hand grenades, seven bags of explosive materials, four boxes of chemicals, eighteen wireless radios, and six boxes of secret documents were seized.

### Soviet Films Banned in the French Concession; All Political Activities and Propaganda, Regardless of Source, are Prohibited

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that it has been learned that Soviet films, since being imported into the Shanghai market, have been banned for the first time by the French Concession Police Department from being screened within the Concession. A spokesperson for the French Police Department, in response to reporters' questions, acknowledged that the Inspection Section of the Police Department had banned the screening of Soviet films, and issued the following formal statement:

In order to maintain order and prevent incidents that disrupt public security, the French Concession authorities have recently taken measures to prohibit all political activities and propaganda, regardless of their source. This is in accordance with the regulations of the French Concession, which stipulate that the French Concession must observe absolute neutrality. Therefore, the French authorities have reached an agreement with Soviet film distributors that Soviet films will no longer be screened within the French Concession. The above news was disclosed two weeks after the Soviet films were stopped from being screened.

The most recent film was screened at the Dôme Theatre. Since then, no Soviet films have been screened in any of the theaters in the French Concession. Soviet films are very popular in Shanghai, especially among Russians, and many of them are musical films. Others depict various current situations in the Soviet Union.

### Inspection of Price-Gouging Stores to Begin Today; Equipped with Red Seals to Temporarily Close Stores

At the same time, the Municipal Council hopes to supply the International Settlement with large quantities of stored rice from outside the Concession, such as Pudong.

Over 30,000 Bags of Licensed Rice Sold

The registration of licensed rice stockpiles for rice shops lacking rice in the International Settlement has been completed.

### Rotary Club Continues to Collect Toys for Needy Children at Christmas

The toy drive organized by the Rotary Club, a well-known social organization in this city, in enthusiastic cooperation with the Asia Theater Company, has held two free charity events at the Majestic Theatre and one film screening at the Nanjing Theatre. Six thousand toys have already been collected, but this is still four-tenths short of the target of ten thousand. Recently, various charitable organizations in this city have also sent letters to the club, requesting the distribution of toys as Christmas gifts for needy children. Therefore, the club feels that the number of toys collected is increasingly insufficient for distribution. Giving toys to needy children is a form of educational spiritual relief. The club has been doing this for more than ten years. With the enthusiastic sympathy of the public, it has been able to proceed smoothly and achieve satisfactory results every year. In addition to those already collected this year, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate the remaining four thousand toys, so that needy children can also smile on the festive day of Christmas. Toys, whether new, old, complete or damaged, are all welcome. Donations should be sent to the Marty Motor Company at 640 Avenue Foch, or to Mr. Marber at telephone number 13016. Someone will be sent to collect them.

### Woodbridge's Radio Speech Delivers Earnest Advice to Japan, World Will Never Accept Hegemonic Policy, Prosperity Can Be Restored if Japan Awakens

The well-known foreign commentator, Mr. Woodbridge, recently gave a radio speech on the China-America Broadcasting Station, entitled "If Japan Can Regain Sanity." The full text can be found in the Continental Daily News. The translated gist is as follows: "At present, some people in Japan hope that Japan and the Soviet Union can reach a compromise on the Far East issue. The Japan Times, the mouthpiece of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has proposed seven conditions to persuade the United States to agree to maintain peace in East Asia. The Japanese Prime Minister has also announced three goals, all of which Japan hopes to achieve in the Washington negotiations. However, the US government is unwilling to accept either of the above two requests.

Mistakes Made Due to Following the Beaten Path

The Tanaka Memorial of 1927 advocated conquering the world. Although some Japanese have denounced it as bizarre and absurd, various facts prove that Japan's policy is undoubtedly opportunistic. It once used the occupation of Northeast China to test the reaction of various countries, but the result was that it did not encounter the slightest obstruction. The Lugouqiao Incident in 1937 was not originally intended to be far-reaching. At first, it was only intended to be used as an excuse for military action in North China. Unexpectedly, the scope of the incident expanded day by day, and the attitude of the world's countries showed that it would not encounter any powerful blows on its way forward. That winter, it still intended to accept peace negotiations, thinking that it should stop at the right time. Unexpectedly, various countries made one mistake after another.

Germany and Japan Have Different Aims

We have only seen the transition from the "New Order" in China to the "New Order in East Asia," and then to the so-called "Greater East Asia New Order" and the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The latter includes China, Australia, and Malaya. If we interpret Matsuoka's words seriously, California is also within its scope. However, these are all the intentions of the Japanese military. The Japanese government did not originally have such intentions until the outbreak of the European War, which gave it an unprecedented opportunity to achieve its goals. Japan joined the Axis powers out of practical necessity. The Germans sincerely wished to see Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States meet on the battlefield. In this way, it would not only be able to contain the United Kingdom and the United States, but also weaken Japan's own strength, so that Germany could go anywhere.

It's Still Time to Pull Back from the Brink

My (Woodbridge's self-designation) delusions arose from recent telegrams from Washington. The telegrams briefly listed the conditions put forward by the United States. If these conditions are accepted by Japan, I dream that Japan will eventually have a day of clarity. The conditions put forward by the United States now are to urge Japan to withdraw from the Axis powers, or at least guarantee that it will not join the Axis powers in combat, give up its attempts to advance south and north, withdraw its troops from China and Vietnam, and guarantee equal commercial opportunities for all countries in the Pacific. Now we assume that the Japanese have accepted these conditions.

Otherwise, the Disaster Is Unimaginable

According to the Japanese Minister of Finance, when he was asked to increase the supplementary expenditure of 3.8 billion yuan, he said to the parliament that the total amount of government expenditure since the incident was about 48 billion yuan, which was about the sum of the total expenditure for the 70 years before 1936. He also admitted that the British and American freezing orders have had a serious impact on Japan. Therefore, if the freezing orders are still strictly enforced, the "China Incident" is still not resolved, and Japan goes to war with the United Kingdom and the United States, then in addition to the losses of the army and navy, the economic difficulties will make the lives of the Japanese people in the future unimaginable.

Restoring Prosperity Is Not Difficult

However, if it can accept the conditions of the United States, then its future will be completely new. The economic losses suffered in the China Incident and the Northeast Incident will take years to make up for. However, its economic prospects will definitely change dramatically in a few months and tend towards prosperity. If the Japanese army can withdraw from China, then there will be no obstacles between China and Japan, and they can work together. Japan's past attempts at monopoly must be abandoned. Because of its geographical proximity to China, it will definitely be able to obtain considerable economic benefits from China. At the same time, dismissing its nearly one million troops will add infinite manpower to its industrial development. Japan is currently busy with war and dealing with incidents, so it has no spare capacity to engage in trade and shipping. The United States' proposed condition of equal commercial opportunities for Pacific countries will naturally be interpreted as giving Japan equal rights to freely use the raw materials of Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Macau, the United States, and China. The United Kingdom and the United States will still have to devote themselves to fire production. In this way, Japan will have excellent opportunities in the commodity market after production. The merchant ships currently requisitioned by Japan for military use can then be used on the Pacific supply line.

Survival or Destruction, the Choice Is Theirs

The concept of national glory is by no means essential to Japan at present. Japan's way out at present is either survival or destruction, either prosperity or destruction. It can endure the current sacrifices and stand forever in the position of a civilized country. These slight sacrifices will be enough to compensate in a few years. If it does not change its original intention, it will inevitably fall into destruction. If Japan can change its current state, it should immediately return to its loyal allies, cooperate with them, and forever be a strong country in the world. Japan has always misinterpreted the word cooperation, because the original meaning of cooperation is to work together to achieve the same goal, rather than use force to subdue others in order to achieve one's own selfish desires. Unless Japan can cleanse itself of the hatred caused by the past four years, East Asia will never have a day of peace.

### Paramount Sports Club Donates Huge Scholarship Fund, Charitable Basketball Game Achieves Satisfactory Results, Scholarship Fund Reaches Over 6,000 Yuan

The Shanghai News Readers' Scholarship Fund received over 6,000 yuan from the Paramount Sports Club yesterday from the proceeds of charitable basketball game tickets, the highest donation record since the fundraising this year, enough to subsidize more than 100 poor students. This great act of righteousness has given powerful support to the colleagues of this newspaper's scholarship fund and is deeply appreciated.

Mr. Ku Lien-cheng Was Kind and Benevolent

The Paramount Sports Club was founded before the war by the philanthropist Mr. Ku Lien-cheng, with a well-established organization. It has held charitable competitions over the years, with the proceeds being allocated to charitable causes, achieving outstanding results. Mr. Ku was kind and benevolent, and spared no effort in promoting sports. He was happy to provide support to social welfare and charitable organizations whenever they requested it. He was truly a practitioner of "the greatest joy is in doing good."

Ticket Income Is Equally Distributed

The club's letter stated, "The ticket income from our club's charitable basketball game will be equally distributed to the Shanghai News Readers' Scholarship Fund, the News Daily Loan Scholarship Fund, and the Jidong Children's Education Home's scholarship savings. The result of the competition is that the total income is 19,131 yuan in national currency (all competition expenses of approximately 3,000 yuan are borne by President Ku himself), which has been verified by accountant Xu Yongzuo to be accurate. It is estimated that the Shanghai News Readers' Scholarship Fund should receive 6,377 yuan in national currency. A check is attached for your acceptance and a receipt would be appreciated."

Total Scholarship Fund Is Nearly 50,000

Yesterday's donations included 6,377 yuan from the Paramount Sports Club, 500 yuan from Liu He Ji, and 10 yuan from Mr. Luo Hongtao, totaling 6,887 yuan. The previous balance was 40,430.82 yuan, for a total of 47,317.82 yuan.

### Huge Fire on Chu Pao San Road Yesterday Morning, Destroyed More Than Twenty Houses, Jin Tai Paper Shop Caught Fire and Suffered Heavy Losses, Many People Burned, One Woman and One Child Died, Fire Also Broke Out on Jing An Temple Road Yesterday Afternoon

An unprecedented fire broke out in the French Concession yesterday morning. The fire was so fierce that it had never been seen before. As a result, more than twenty houses were destroyed and more than ten people were killed or injured. The details of the incident are recorded below.

All Fire Engines Dispatched

The Jin Tai Paper Shop at 4 and 6 Chu Pao San Road suddenly caught fire at about 1:00 yesterday morning. At that time, because the shop was piled with a huge amount of paper, the fire spread extremely fiercely. The flames soared and quickly burned to neighboring houses. Residents were awakened from their dreams, fleeing for their lives, and the order was chaotic, with crying and shouting filling the air. The Central Fire Brigade was notified and drove to the scene. Because the fire was not easy to extinguish, it requested that more vehicles be dispatched. Therefore, the French Concession Fire Brigade immediately dispatched all of its approximately 20 pump trucks and ambulances. The Public Concession also dispatched six pump trucks to assist in fighting the fire at the scene. The fire was completely extinguished until noon yesterday.

The Area Burned Covered Dozens of Families

After the incident, it was inspected that the fire extended north to the Hua Du Ballroom at 51 Avenue Edward VII, and south to 49 Rue du Consulat, including 4 and 6 Chu Pao San Road, the Jin Tai Paper Shop, 8 and 10, the Li Chang First Warehouse, 12, the Heng He Tai Paper and Foil Shop, 14 and 16, the Ping An Hotel, 18 and 20, a silver dollar bar, 22 and 24, the Tong Yi Shop, 26 and 28, a certain wine bar, 44 Rue du Consulat, the An Le Barber Shop, 46, 48, 50, and 52, and on Avenue Edward VII, it extended to 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, and 47, etc., more than twenty houses. Among them, the Ping An Hotel had more than 140 rooms on the upper floors of the above numbers, all of which were burned down, resulting in the greatest loss.

Thirteen People Injured, Two Killed

When the fire was raging, residents fled one after another, and many people were injured. A total of eight men and women fell and were injured by jumping from buildings, and four people were burned. All were sent to the hospital for treatment. The injured included Mao Jiangshi, Liu Zhangshi, Wu Yingchang, Wu Jiangshi (wife of lawyer Lu Ping), Zhang Yebi, Jin Jiabin, and many others. It was also learned that one woman and one child had died in the fire, and one firefighter was injured. After the incident, the police learned that the fire started at the Jin Tai Paper Shop and went to summon the owner, Tang Shaotai. Unexpectedly, Tang had fled in fear of punishment. Statistics show that the losses in this battle were extremely large, but most of them had fire insurance.

Fire Also Broke Out on Jing An Temple Road

At 2:30 yesterday afternoon, a fire suddenly broke out on the ground floor of No. 3, 646 Lane (Ming Yu Fang), Jing An Temple Road, Public Concession, and immediately spread, breaking through the roof. After the fire brigade learned of this, it immediately drove to the scene to fight the fire, which was finally extinguished after a long time. At that time, many residents lived on the upper floors of the building. Because the ladder was burned, they fell and were injured by jumping from the building, and several people were burned. Sun Hufa, 29 years old, was injured in the face, hands, and left foot. Sun Saijin, 57 years old, was injured in the face and hands. Dai Gentang, 21 years old, was injured in the head. Chen Sijin, 26 years old, was burned all over the body. The above were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. In addition, Sun Linzhuang, 38 years old, was burned all over the body. Dong Abao, 12 years old, and Wu Jiakui, 40 years old, were injured in the head and face. They were sent to the Red Cross Hospital. It was also learned that the bodies of one man, one woman, one boy, and one girl were found in the fire after the incident.

### Dance Girl Almost Electrocuted by Her Husband After Breaking Off Engagement, Yan Yinhe Sentenced to Five Years for Attempted Murder

Zhong Yumei, a 19-year-old Henan woman living at 1 Huanghe Road, worked as a dance girl at the Jue Lu Ballroom. In March of this year, she met a dance patron, Yan Yinhe, a 29-year-old man from Suzhou. At that time, Yan claimed that he had not yet married and intended to spend the rest of his life with Zhong. Zhong was seduced by his sweet words and registered their engagement with Yan in the newspaper in May, and immediately began cohabitation. Unexpectedly, after cohabitation, she discovered that Yan was actually an

Unemployed Idler

His food, clothing, housing, and transportation all depended on Zhong's income from dancing. When that was not enough, he used all kinds of methods to swindle her savings of more than 4,000 yuan. Unable to bear the hardship, she managed to break off the engagement with Yan in September, but Yan still pestered her from time to time. At about 3:00 the day before yesterday afternoon, Yan went to the Asia Hotel at 571 Hankou Road, opened room 242, and telephoned Zhong, using the excuse of buying a winter coat on her behalf,

Luring Her to Come

At this time, Yan had started to want to kill Zhong, as he could no longer obtain money from her. He imitated the method used by the Zhou brothers to kill their father, and purchased a very long roll of electric wire and three plugs from an old goods stall on Ningbo Road in the French Concession. One plug was installed at each end of the electric wire. Another plug was installed on the electric light in the room using a light bulb socket. Then, one end of the plug was inserted, so that the electric wire

Passed Through Current

Reaching the plug at the other end. After arranging everything properly, when the woman came, Yan became intimate with her. After the event, taking advantage of her exhaustion, he suddenly placed the plug carrying an electric current on her right waist, intending to electrocute her to death. The woman felt pain from the electricity and struggled with all her might, and shouted for help. The tea room attendant opened the door and entered, and the woman was rescued. The incident was reported to the Old Gate Police Station, and Hua Detective Liu Junjie rushed there and

Arrested Yan

Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi prosecuted him for attempted murder, and stated that the hospital examination showed that Zhong's right waist was burned, but the injury was minor. When questioned, Yan admitted that he intended to kill the woman, but claimed that he had repeatedly attempted suicide and that he had agreed with the woman to die together this time. However, Zhong denied this. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Xiao sentenced Yan Yinhe to five years of imprisonment for attempted murder, and the electric wire, plugs, etc. were confiscated.

### Deputy Director of the Police Department Captures a Bandit, Confiscates a Pistol

The North China Daily News said that the Deputy Director of the Public Concession Police Department, T. Robertson, personally captured an armed bandit at the Racecourse at 8:45 yesterday morning (28th). A few minutes before being arrested, the bandit, together with three other bandits (none of whom were armed), had robbed a Chinese man of his overcoat, 340 yuan in cash, and a bank check at the intersection of Dagu Road and Ma Huo Road, and then dispersed. The other three bandits fled to the French Concession. The armed bandit stayed behind, threatening the victim not to call the police, and then also headed towards the French Concession. However, the victim was unwilling to give up and followed from a distance. After entering the French Concession, he reported to two Chinese constables to pursue. The bandit fled quickly. After returning to the Public Concession via several roads, Robertson was driving his car east along Racecourse Road, heading to the Police Headquarters for work. He heard the police siren blaring and saw the bandit fleeing towards Racecourse Road, with two Chinese constables chasing behind. Robertson then drove his car to block him, jumped out of the car, and captured the bandit. He confiscated a pistol and four bullets from him. Two of the other bandits who committed the robbery were also arrested by detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station not long after. They were escorted to the First Special Court for questioning this morning (29th).

Commercial News

### Gold Supply Abundant; Fluctuation Range Gradually Decreases

Yesterday, the cash market started dark, and the fluctuation turned small. The trend continued to weaken, and the price once fell below 13,000 yuan. Because the US-Japan negotiations have been difficult to obtain accurate news, all parties are tired, and the market transaction is supply to wholesale, and demand is zero. Xiangxing Yong sold 460 taels, Tianyuan advanced 420 taels, Mingfeng sold 380 taels, and Chengji advanced 380 taels, Hesheng and bill merchants each advanced 1790 taels, and Zhongxing advanced 140 taels. It was still difficult to resist the selling momentum. The price fell sharply from the morning opening price of 13,500 yuan to a low price of 12,950 yuan, which was pulled up by short covering. The closing price was still 400 yuan lower. Half-day transactions totaled 7,360 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and the outside market price was 13,300 yuan.

Cash Continues to Fall by 400 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 13,500 yuan at 9:00 AM, the same as the closing price the previous night. Xianghe, Xiangxing Yong, Mingfeng, and Tianyuan came to sell aggressively, and the price plunged by 550 yuan, entering below 13,000 yuan, falling to a low price of 12,950 yuan. Chengji suddenly came to advance aggressively, and Xianghe repurchased Hesheng, Yongcheng, bill merchants, and Zhongxing to compete for strength, and the price rose back by 300 yuan, rising to 13,250 yuan. Xiangxing Yong, Tongkang Yong, and Tianyuan sold again, and the price fell back to 13,050 yuan. The closing price at 10:30 AM was 13,100 yuan, a further decrease of 400 yuan from the closing price the previous night. There was a difference of 550 yuan in half a day. There was no market in the afternoon. The selling price of the gold store's own brand gold in Jinmen City was 13,400 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by about 1,000 yuan.

Jewelry First Small, Then Recovered

The exchange price of silver building jewelry per tael was first quoted by Datonghang and Xintonghang as 50 yuan lower, at 1,350 yuan. At 1:30 PM, it rose back by 30 yuan, totaling 1,380 yuan (purchase price reduced by 150 yuan). Patterned silver still hangs at 22 yuan, and the black market at 16 yuan is said to be flat.

### Black Market Exchange Rate Remains Stable

The foreign exchange market yesterday, the Central Bank and HSBC's quotes did not fluctuate. The prices of small counters such as HSBC were also flat. The black market exchange rate of British and American foreign exchange, the black market British exchange rate, one pound was quoted at 3.75, with supply but no demand, and remained stable throughout. The US exchange rate showed a slight softening, and it was not certain that 3.75 could be settled. A certain non-essential goods foreign firm once raised the price to settle, but did not get it, and there was no transaction. The closing price at noon was the same as the previous price, which was flat with the previous day and the US slightly softened. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Yesterday's foreign currency market, British and American gold pounds each fell by 10 yuan, British gold bills rose by 1 yuan, and American gold bills once fell to 26.5 yuan, and finally were 27.4 yuan, which was an increase of 20 cents compared with the previous day. Hong Kong bills were slightly tired, and Japanese gold bills and Korean bills did not change. The former still stood at the original price of 2.7 yuan, and the latter was still 2.6 yuan. The demand for military tickets was surprisingly strong, and the evening market was as high as 3.6 yuan.

### Large Investors Add to Positions on Dips; Prevent Excessive Fall in Yarn Market

The yarn market started weak and then rose, but the trend was slightly calm. This is because the bulls are preparing to take delivery, and the shorts also intend to cover. Therefore, the table surface is loose and tight. The large investors have no intention of abandoning the goods they bought, and they continue to add to their positions on dips, so the market is stabilizing. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 2,440 yuan, and the low price was 2,365 yuan. Due to the week-end relationship in the afternoon, as usual

Double Horse opened flat in the morning. The opening price was 2,410 yuan. As soon as this price opened, there were many sellers in the market, and the market fell straight to 2,365 yuan. At this time, gold also fell. Unexpectedly, the opening price of yarn and cloth on the exchange did not fall sharply, and people's hearts took a good step. At the same time, large investors took delivery, so the shorts also actively covered, and the market slowly rose back to 2,440 yuan at the close. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 2,850 bales.

The market situation of the Golden Double Horse Futures Yarn Market, after the delivery in November, started trading again yesterday, and the market atmosphere turned from weak to strong, with fluctuations ranging from 70 to 80 yuan to more than 100 yuan. When the morning first opened, it was first because of rumors that the negotiations between the US and Japan seemed to be turning unfavorable, and people were generally concerned and inevitably had unnecessary worries. Therefore, the factory orders first fell, and once fell to a low price of 2,365.00. Relying on the weakness of the futures yarn, gold companies and securities firms successively spit out, and the December contract opened at a low price of 2,350 yuan, the January contract opened at 2,470 yuan, and also once fell to 2,450 yuan, and the February contract was close to the low price of 2,520 yuan. After entering, with the gold market turning strong, the current yarn is also hovering upstream, people's hearts are stable, and the buying side absorbs suddenly and sees strong again, and the prices of each month's futures rise successively, the recent term rose to 2,450.00, the January contract also rose to 2,530.00, and the February contract rose to 2,580.00. Its fluctuating trend is completely tied to the gold market and factory orders. In fact, the current trend of the yarn market is following the general attention of people to the international situation, and its root is the tightening of silver funds and the relationship of mortgages. It is said that the cost of yarn is 300 to 400 yuan higher than the current market price. Therefore, due to this level, those who short can't help but have concerns, while the potential of the multi-party is inevitably reduced due to the obstruction of the situation and silver funds. Observing its trend, if the silver funds and the environment can be slightly relaxed, the change will inevitably be rapid. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and the list is shown below

The current cotton situation is still stagnant. The factory side has no appetite for processing due to the sluggish yarn market. The industry is watching with hands tied as the end of the year approaches. Everyone is waiting for the opportunity to decide the outcome.

The New York cotton market rose in the early morning due to purchases by peers and brokers, and then fell back due to short covering and profit-taking by the Southern gangs. Yesterday's closing price fell by about three or four pounds from the previous day.

There were few transactions in the Indian cotton market. At the same time, the market was slightly tired due to the continuous short covering by cotton merchants and sales by speculators. Yesterday's closing prices fell by two or three rupees each. It is also predicted that the market situation will continue to be slightly lower by half a rupee when the market opens today.

### The Essentials of Price Control

— Jack

Looking at the implementation of prices by the Shanghai Municipal Council since November, it can be roughly divided into two parts: (A) Control methods, which are further divided into three items: Control of four daily necessities: rice, flour, coal, and oil; Approval of the limited prices of imported goods, medicines, etc. assessed by the Importers Association; Crackdown on hoarding of dangerous liquids and substances. The current status of the implementation of the first two items, with regard to necessities, the control of rice is the strictest, such as the establishment of rice sales offices, restrictions on the quantity of goods, investigation of hoarding, and prohibition of private transportation; flour is being investigated and funds are being raised to purchase flour for flat sales from the prohibition of transportation; as for edible oil, only merchants are being invited to contract for purchase and the selling price is being controlled; coal is only being investigated for the use of coal in industry. (B) Control techniques, which include Regulations on the setting of labels on retail items; Verification of records of goods purchased, sold, and inventoried.

We analyze the price control policies adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Council, which include the following four types: One is to purchase and sell at half price, such as the measures for necessities such as rice, flour, powder, oil, and coal; the second is to limit prices, such as the announcement of limited prices for imported goods, food, medicines, etc.; the third is to limit the quantity purchased, such as the restriction of one dou of food rice per person; the fourth is to crack down on national hoarding, such as the registration of rice and flour, and the regulations on licensing for the storage of dangerous liquids and substances. Although; transportation is difficult, funds are short and thin, and it is difficult to see results by selling cheaply, this is the difficulty of selling at flat prices. When supply and demand are balanced, prices will be flat. If you force a fixed limit, evils will arise. This is the difficulty of limiting prices. Investigation and statistics, dance planning and arrangement, if there is anything that is not successful, it will be difficult to succeed. This is the difficulty of limiting purchases. The value of the currency is falling, prices are rising, and protecting wealth and seeking profit is the constant sentiment of people. This is the difficulty of cracking down on hoarding. If the system is not complete, the organization is not strict, the planning is not thorough, and the implementation is not effective, as a result, the effect is not seen but the evils have already arisen, and the price has not been halved and the law has been relaxed. For example, today's limited-price products, the stores selling them, for example, have no goods and refuse to sell them. Also, for example, the limited quantity of rice, the profiteering奸民, with their waists wrapped in rope, privately transport it out of the border. The limited-price products are not in short supply, and the limited quantity of rice is only one dou, and its evils are like this, and others are irrelevant.

The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office once said: In order to seek a balance in the import of goods and a reasonable supply of prices, it is intended to seek cooperation with the Price Equalization Fund Committee, various shipping companies, and commercial officials from various countries: This is the premise of flat-price purchase and sale. It also said: Officially set prices must not be exceeded, and those who violate them will be punished; at the same time, members of the Importers Association will also refuse to continue supplying goods to those who violate them; This is the pillar of limited prices. It is also said: When necessary, retail sales will be carried out on their own. In the future, those who purchase goods will be given identification cards and a per capita allocation method will be adopted; This is the foundation for limiting purchases. It is further claimed that the supply of goods is limited to urgent needs, and if possible, containers should be opened and labels should be removed; and importers will recover old containers and old labels before distributing new goods; This is the key to cracking down on hoarding. Therefore, today's Shanghai Municipal Council controls the payment of compensation, striving to eliminate evils and achieve effects, to have strict laws and flat prices, to not disturb the people but to have the reality of benefiting the people, to punish hoarding but not to infringe on the inventory that should be there, which is solid enough to be the political body to be used.

### Domestic Debt Stable

The over-the-counter market for public bonds was extremely stable yesterday. Moreover, due to the Saturday closing relationship, there were very few transactions, and the trend was still uncertain. The rise and fall of various public bonds differed quite a bit. Both the bulls and the bears were expecting something and had their own goals. It is feared that there will not be any huge ups and downs for the time being. Yesterday was Saturday and the market opened at 11:00 AM, with only one trade. The pressure from the shorts still felt relatively heavy. Type C once rose to 8.7 yuan after opening, but failed to stabilize. Type B had more scattered retail demand, so it was uniquely superior. The buyers only absorbed a slight drop in Rund and Yiji. The sellers were accompanied by Dingkang and Tongkang. As a result, except for Type D, which did not open, and Type A, which had no high or low prices, the other three types also varied. The total transaction volume was estimated to be about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock transaction: 100 shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 60 yuan per share.

### Western Flour Uniquely Tired; Japonica Rice Continues to Report Declines

Since the suspension of northern sales of foreign flour, the market situation has become increasingly lifeless. Although there is demand in this street, those who hold the goods are timid and fearful, and mostly take the initiative to devalue the price and sell early. In particular, the imported flour registered in West Wharf is tired. Yesterday, the price of West Wharf Golden Dragon was discussed as 35 yuan, which is close to the flat-price public sale price. However, the stock of wheat in the small wheat wharf has been dry for a long time, and new arrivals have not followed. Occasionally, there are arrivals that still try to defend, so Duke wheat is still standing between 72 and 3 yuan. Bran has been cleared by inland villages, and small bags of bran have seen a slight station again, with a price opening at 56 yuan.

The northern transportation of foreign wheat flour has not stopped. Those who have been transporting to Tianjin for days have been recorded in this newspaper many times. It is now known that the Yih和 洋行 Rising Sun Wheel will go to Tianjin today. In addition to transporting bulk foreign rice and sugar, there are also a large number of 43,300 bags of foreign wheat flour transported to Tianjin.

Foreign rice continues to arrive at the port. The Yih和 洋行 Rising Sun Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and unloaded 5,072 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, mooring at the Roosevelt Wharf. Another 8,341 bags of foreign rice are scheduled to be transported to Tianjin by the original ship today, and 2,000 bags will be added in this city to be transported to Tianjin, (祖)

Yesterday, foreign rice was still scarce in the market, and domestic rice was gradually becoming more prosperous. Yesterday, vendors brought three or four hundred bags of northern and southern japonica rice and top-grade rice, but the actual sales were not even half of the appetite, so the price of each rice was reduced by two or three yuan. Kunshan's new japonica rice ranged from 180 yuan to 175 yuan, Qingsi thin rice from 171 yuan to 170 yuan, Du pointed rice 164 yuan, and Yinyuan 180 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains Rose More, Fell Less

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market situation, edible oil first saw a setback due to the urgent sale of floating hoarding, and finally returned to rise after being absorbed and purchased by people in the industry. As a result, the former and latter are similar to each other, with a slight difference of two or three yuan. Soybeans saw a turn-up of two or three yuan due to the lively sales of local customers, and corn also tended to rise by one or two yuan due to weak hoarding purchases. The unified market sold more than 100 barrels of Dayun soybean oil, 10 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil, and another 200 cans, 500 dan of Rihua factory vegetable oil, 1,000 bags of Tianjin New Jinyuan, another 400 bags of green beans, 2,000 bags of corn spot, and more than 300 tons of futures.

### Sugar Market Without Major Fluctuations

Yesterday was Saturday, with the joint venture company settling accounts and futures trading suspended. Only over three thousand bags of spot goods were traded. The trend was stable, without major fluctuations. The guild's pricing: this month's No. 24 coarse white was initially priced at 202 yuan in the morning, reaching 204 yuan, then 203.5 yuan in the afternoon, ultimately closing at 204 yuan. October was initially priced at 200 yuan to 201 yuan in the morning, with one afternoon session at 202 yuan. September was at 196 yuan. Hong Kong coarse was at 171 yuan to 175 yuan. Taikoo (DY refined white) mark was at 177 yuan, HX mark at 176 yuan. Dutch red spot goods were at 168 yuan to 169.5 yuan, opening higher by one yuan to 170.5 yuan in the afternoon, with road goods trading at 173.5 yuan.

The Java Company's Zhisali ship arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 6,000 tons of sugar, totaling 60,000 bags, loaded from Java. It docked at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. Also, Jardine Matheson's Rising Sun ship loaded 2,180 bags of sugar from this city and transported them to Tianjin.

### Anthracite Coal Plummets: Coal Merchants Reap What They Sow

In the coal market, since the new arrival of white coal, managers and dealers have resumed sales as usual. The informal market has disappeared, and old stockpiles are rushing to be released, causing anthracite coal to be greatly stimulated, with prices reversing and plummeting. Indian anthracite coal entered the market at 800 yuan, but the future market only opened at 720 yuan. Kailan coal also followed suit, plummeting to 650 yuan for lumps, a sharp drop of over 100 yuan. Things reach an extreme and then revert, prosperity is followed by decline, the principles of heaven circulate, and it can be said to be unerring. Those who climb high fall hard, and coal merchants reap what they sow.

### Rosary Peas Not Very Useful

Rosary peas, also known as red beans, are scarce in both arrivals and inventory. However, this item, aside from its occasional use in medicinal materials, is primarily used in pastry shops as "eyes" in powdered goods, with minimal demand. Therefore, market prices have not been able to rise significantly. Yesterday, the market price was 200 yuan, only a limited increase from before.

### Cotton Cloth Trading Exceptionally Brisk

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market fluctuated, with exceptionally brisk trading, as both buyers and sellers showed little interest. Selling prices first declined and then rebounded. Flower and butterfly coarse cloth was initially sold at 89.25 yuan in the morning, closing at 90.05 yuan to 90.1 yuan. Fuguang fine cloth factory orders were bid up to 80 yuan in the future market, but no transactions occurred. Spot goods were generally 2 yuan cheaper per bolt. Other grades of coarse and fine cloth showed little fluctuation compared to the previous day, with some increasing or decreasing by 5 jiao. Over 100 pieces were traded on this street.

Eastern Cloth: Futures prices fell sharply due to the steep decline of Blue Phoenix gauze. Lu soft cloth and regular colored ball mark cloth for December opened down 2.5 yuan, closing at 82.1 yuan, a drop of 2.9 yuan per bolt compared to before settlement. January closed at 84.8 yuan, also down 2.69 yuan. Spot market selling prices showed minimal changes. The leading fine cloth factory orders closed at 88 yuan at noon, up 5 jiao, while lower-grade miscellaneous fine cloth continued to decline by 5 jiao to 1 yuan due to sluggish actual sales, with few transactions.

### Western-Lettered Woolen Fabrics Not So Special

Yesterday, the woolen fabric trend was stable. Western-style fabrics had stronger market conditions than general fabrics. Actual sales seemed weaker than at the beginning of the week. Prices for riding breeches, pilica, and light floral woolen fabrics were generally weak internally but strong externally. Woolen fabrics with Western letters have recently become less popular than before. This is because this year, domestically produced goods, whether Western-style or floral, iroko, doskin, panama, or single-sided floral, all have Western letters woven into them. They are everywhere in the market and are no longer special. Conversely, genuine English woolen fabrics often no longer have Western letters woven into them. Therefore, woolen fabrics with letters today are no longer a valuable selling point.

### The Way of Reading

— Qingzheng

When it comes to the words "reading," we should first understand why we read. Most people only know how to "memorize mechanically" and cannot understand its truth. Now I will summarize it in one sentence: Reading is for learning the principles of being a person. Some people think that reading is for becoming a high official and making a fortune, but that is not correct. I remember Zeng Guofan's letter to his son Ji Hong saying: "... I don't want you to become a high official, but I hope you will be a gentleman who understands principles through reading... You must not be greedy for luxury..." (From this, we can know that reading is not for personal wealth and enjoyment, but to make some contributions to society and the country.)

As for what attitude should be adopted when reading? I think the first thing to do is to concentrate your mind and body. For example, when writing an essay, my mind is only thinking about how to write the essay, and I don't care about anything else; as the saying goes, "You can't do two things at once," otherwise you are not focused, and the same is true for reading and doing things. If you don't concentrate on reading, then this lesson is equivalent to "reading in vain;" because his heart has not received it, how can he understand the book? Secondly, you must not think you are too smart. Zhu Xi said: "Because he first has the idea of ​​becoming a sage, it is difficult to enter." Reading should also have durability. If you read a lesson for a long time and still cannot understand its true meaning, if you don't have durability, you simply don't like to read it; or you read for a while and then go to play, and after playing for a while, you come back to read; all of this is useless.

If you want to understand the true meaning of reading, you should have the above-mentioned attitudes, carefully read it several times, extract the essence, and remember it firmly; don't read too much and then find it difficult to understand the reason. Therefore, reading is not about quantity, but about being able to understand the essence of the book.

Some people also get discouraged because they don't read well. I think if you read according to the above principles, you will eventually succeed! Because "failure is the mother of success!"

### The Water-Drinking American

— Liyi

Abraham Lincoln, the American president who liberated the slaves, was very poor when he was young. Once, he went to work in a printing shop in England. Almost everyone in the shop, which had more than fifty workers, liked to drink beer, before breakfast, during breakfast, after breakfast, during lunch, during dinner, and after dinner, they had to drink several times a day; but Lincoln didn't drink any, he only drank some plain water, and his work efficiency was greater than others. He could carry lead type with both hands up and down the stairs, but others couldn't do it. Therefore, everyone called him "the water-drinking American." The other workers often owed a lot of money because of excessive drinking, and their salaries were spent as soon as they got them. Later, even the hotel refused to lend them money for wine, so they had to ask Lincoln to guarantee their credit. Lincoln not only did not waste his salary, but also had excellent credit. Only then did the workers have the opportunity to taste wine again; and Lincoln then deducted the workers' wine money on the spot when he paid his salary every Saturday and returned it to the hotel without any ambiguity. Therefore, later, this water-drinking American was considered by the manager to be the most reusable worker in the entire printing shop. All urgent documents were ordered to be handled by him, because he not only did it better than others, but also did it faster, and his salary was naturally particularly high, so Lincoln's life gradually improved!

Children! Perseverance is the first requirement for success. None of the great men did not struggle from hardship. After reading the anecdotes of Lincoln, how should you encourage yourself to work hard!

### 30,000 People Freeze to Death a Year

— Yingdai

Children, this shocking number, maybe you wouldn't know if I didn't mention it, right? In Shanghai, this city, about 30,000 people freeze to death a year, which is really shocking. And among these 30,000 people who froze to death, children account for a large number. Maybe close to ten thousand!

When we go to the streets, we can see people freezing to death lying on the side of the road every day, which is terrible to see. Among them, there are men, women, old, and young. Although some die from illness, most of them freeze to death. These people have no home to return to and no place to complain. It is not without reason that some people go down the path of depravity in order to eat white bread and die without regret, but these people are only a small part after all.

Even if adults don't care about them, but children are pure-hearted, it's not like they all eat white bread, right? So many children die on the road every day due to hunger and cold, isn't it an innocent disaster, and worthy of our sympathy? Therefore, we cannot ignore this issue!

Children are the future masters of the country. Among these innocent children who freeze to death on the road, there may be those with talent who can be cultivated in the future. Therefore, the more children who die unjustly today, the more national vitality will be lost in the future. Whether from the perspective of sympathy or the perspective of the country, we cannot sit idly by and watch so many children die unjustly, and we should find ways to reduce it.

The above numbers are obtained from the statistics of the Pushan Villa, a charitable organization that specializes in collecting corpses from the streets, and must be quite accurate. Moreover, according to the situation in previous years, the more people die in winter. When a cold spell comes, many people will die. Now, winter is coming again, and the cold is constantly attacking us. Children who freeze to death due to hunger and cold will naturally increase with the degree of cold weather. If you don't want to let children die unjustly like this, in addition to hoping that charitable organizations will provide more relief, you also have to hope that every child can save some candy money to help these poor children. The fewer children who die unjustly, the better. So not only is it disaster relief, it can simply be regarded as saving the country!

### Improved Baked Sweet Potato

— Zhi

Now I want to talk to you children about eating, which is "Improved Baked Sweet Potato." What is "Improved Baked Sweet Potato?" This is what I invented, let me tell you slowly!

Baked sweet potato is a popular food that fills the streets and alleys now. It is fragrant, sweet, soft, and has an inconspicuous temptation, which is its heat. So it is great to eat when it is cold. Unfortunately, the price is too expensive. A small one sells for 1 jiao, and a larger one costs 2 or 3 jiao. As for raw sweet potatoes, you can buy a jin for only 8 or 9 jiao, so it is best to bake it yourself. But after I baked it several times, it was mostly not thoroughly baked. If I wanted to bake it for a longer time, then the half-raw and half-cooked outer skin would be too burnt to eat. So I was eager to get a wonderful way to bake sweet potatoes myself, and the result was finally satisfactory.

The method: put the washed sweet potatoes in a pot, and cook them like boiled sweet potatoes until all the sweet potatoes are cooked (don't be too soft, otherwise the skin will easily fall off), then take them out and use lead wire clips to put them on the stove to dry, until the skin is like the skin of the baked sweet potatoes sold outside, and then you are successful. Children, think how economical and convenient it is! In addition, there are two points that you should pay attention to: Be careful of the stove fire burning your little hands when you do it. After it is done, let your parents taste the good and big ones first.

### The Phenomenon of Cold

The climate is gradually getting colder with the withering of the trees. The northwest wind blew all day, and a layer of dark clouds densely covered the gloomy sky. Not a ray of sunshine could penetrate through, so the mercury column of the thermometer suddenly dropped to about forty or fifty degrees; it was only ten degrees or so away from the freezing point, and the phenomenon of cold was fully expressed, so the breath exhaled from everyone's mouth turned white; the water pipes in Awei's house were wrapped with straw; the leaves in the garden fell one by one, but the leaves of the pine tree were still green, not afraid of the cold at all; When Awei went to school, he saw beggars trembling and groaning by the road... These special scenes were being played out in front of Awei, and he was asking in his mind "Why?" He thought about it again and again, but he couldn't answer himself, so he had to ask his brother, which was the most convenient.

"Why does the breath we exhale from our mouths turn white in winter? This is because when the climate is cold, the temperature is of course lower than the temperature of our body, and most of the gas exhaled from our mouths is water vapor, which condenses when it encounters the cold air outside and turns into fog, so it looks white. Why do water pipes need to be wrapped with straw? When the temperature drops to 32 degrees Fahrenheit, all water will freeze. There is always water in the water pipes exposed to the air. When the water freezes in the water pipes, it will expand, and this expansion force is very large. If the water pipes are full of water, they will be burst by the expansion, so when it is cold, they must be wrapped with straw, because straw does not conduct cold and heat. Wrapping it outside the water pipes, the cold air cannot freeze the water in the water pipes, and the water pipes will not be burst. Other trees lose their leaves, but why don't pine trees lose their leaves? The composition of pine tree leaves is not much different from the leaves of other deciduous trees. The reason why it does not lose its leaves is that the skin of pine tree leaves is more sticky and tough than other tree leaves, so it can be green even in winter. Don't say that beggars tremble in cold weather, even we will tremble. Why? You must know that this is a natural movement. When trembling in the cold, it can make the muscles of our body move, and at the same time, it can speed up the circulation of blood in the body, and the body will become warmer. This kind of trembling is the same principle as rubbing our hands together or getting up and jumping when our hands are cold to warm our body. The reason why the beggars on the road are trembling is that they don't have thick clothes to wear and no hot food to eat!" Awei's brother solved his four "whys" one by one. Of course, he was very grateful in his heart, but he didn't say it.

### Blind Fish in the Cave

— Xinfang

Two weeks ago, I participated in the worship of the Hua Dong Baptist Church. That day, Mr. Zhang Chunjiang was responsible for preaching. He quoted an anecdote from his study abroad in the United States in those years to encourage us to have a spirit of unremitting struggle for everything, whether in the academic era or after entering the society. He said: "One day, when I followed a few friends to travel somewhere in the United States, we suddenly entered a deep cave. The cave was pitch black, and the sun could never shine on this corner. There was a small pool under the cave, and several small fish were swimming back and forth in the pool. Strangely, I stared at it and found that none of these fish's eyes were not blind.

"Why are none of these fish's eyes not blind?" Mr. Zhang wanted us to think about it. "Of course, it is because they are in a dark environment all day long, and the function of their eyes has gradually disappeared, resulting in this phenomenon."

Children! Mr. Zhang's narration is a great lesson for us. If we don't use our brains for a day, what will be the difference between the result and the blind fish in the cave?

Children! Please use a pen to black out the black spots to make a picture.

### Opportunities and Successes of Movie Stars

— Yifan

For all kinds of performing arts, if you want to improve, the first thing is to have talents and methods of training talents, which is especially important in the film industry. For example, in the United States, I don't know how many thousands of people hope to become stars, and as a result, hope often turns into dreams. The MGM film company has a famous intelligence appraiser, Edward Gario, who tells people: The opportunity is very important for the election of stars and the success or failure of stars (opportunity is like our country's saying of fate). He cited the following examples of big stars:

Myrna Loy: Before becoming famous, she was a minimal character. It was not until a new director discovered that her face had natural beauty and her actions were natural, and he took a fancy to her, so she went smoothly and achieved today's status.

Ann Sheridan is a famous "Oomph" girl. Her fame relied on a journalist inventing a new word OOMPH.

How did Dorothy Lamour become famous? When the star test was held, the director suddenly stopped testing other actresses and paid special attention to Miss Dorothy in the crowd. Therefore, her fame rose sharply and her luck was high.

The examiners of Hollywood star exams believe that frontal tests may not be perfect, so there is another method of side knocking, which has also discovered many talents.

Tyrone Power and Sonja Henie are both famous people who failed the initial test. Before joining 20th Century Fox, Betty Grable had failed the exams of two film companies. Linda Darnell was recognized by the director a year after the exam. It can be seen that the rise and fall of movie stars in the film city depends on their acting skills and physical beauty, but the fate of good and bad luck is also an important key.

### Discovering New Talents from the Stage

— Ciping

Yan Jun Joins the National Federation

Not long ago, film companies were in excessive demand in order to increase production, but due to the lack of actors, it was not enough to distribute them, and there was an outcry for an actor shortage. Therefore, various companies set up actor training classes, etc., to greatly promote new people, but the new people who graduated from the training classes, the achievements on the silver screen are simply rare. Most of the red stars on the screen today are still discovered from the stage. Han Fei was one of them not long ago.

Recently, Yan Jun, a popular young actor on the stage who played in "Metamorphosis" at the Carlton, has recently joined China's largest Lianying Film Company with the introduction of Yan Ciping. Jun has been appreciated and valued by producer Zhang Shankun. He signed a formal contract in the Lilac Garden yesterday. It is said that the first year is a series of films, and four films will be shot on a special contract within a year, with a remuneration of 1,200 to 1,600 yuan per film. The National Federation Company has many young and beautiful female stars who are enough to attract people, such as Chen Yunshang, Chen Yanyan, Tong Yuejuan, Yuan Meiyun, Gu Lanjun, Wang Xichun, etc., but there are very few male actors who are healthy and of the right height. Now Yan Jun's joining the National Federation Company is to strengthen the lineup of male actors in the National Federation, so that female actors are not allowed to be beautiful in the front, so the National Federation is gradually strengthening.

### Deanna Durbin's New Film After Marriage

It was previously reported that Deanna Durbin had disagreements with the Universal Film Company and had terminated the contract. According to a sea letter received from New York, this is not true. The original letter stated that Deanna Durbin still has a four-year contract with the company. During this period, she can only make films for Universal, so new films will be continuously shipped to China. The one that will arrive in Shanghai soon is "Paul" co-starred with Charles Laughton.

### Franke Hosts the Press

— Haixing

The Chinese Film Academy has decided to start recruiting students in early November. Therefore, the president of the academy, Franke, specially hosted fellow journalists at the Huizhong Hotel at noon yesterday. He also invited them to visit the academy site at 994 Xiahui Road beforehand and discussed the direction of the "Film Academy" on the spot. Newcomers from the industry provided many opinions. According to Franke, a famous European director with decades of experience in film art, "Children of the World," which was recently screened in the United Nations, is his first work in China.

Chen Yunshang returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Due to the fatigue of the journey, she has extended her leave from the National Federation for a week. Wan Cang is currently rushing to complete the filming work for her new work "Private Love."

There is news from Chen Yunshang that Tan Ying will return to Shanghai within the year to rejoin the film industry.

According to Zhang Huichong, if his new work "Wu Xiong After the Robbery" can be completed within the year, he will perform magic for a week at the Great Shanghai Theater on New Year's Day of the Gregorian calendar. The wonderful programs include water escape and fire escape performances.

"Home" has been scheduled to be screened at the Shanghai Guangtong Theater on New Year's Day of the Gregorian calendar, and the ticket price will not increase.

Chapter 19: Dusk, the Dust of the Nomad Cavalry Fills the City

As they were talking, the golden drums shook loudly, and shouts rose up. Zhang Cangqiu and others had already crossed the river from the front. Liu Yining immediately got on his horse, and Xu Jing also followed suit. Everyone turned around and killed them, sweeping away the fleeing bandits. Seven or eight out of ten bandits were killed or wounded, and the rest fled with Li Yan. Xu Jing, Liu Yining, Zhang Cangqiu, and Chen Fei joined forces, and they were very happy. They pursued and killed them for a while, and took Luanzhou by force. The sky was bright, so they collected the troops to appease the people, and then picked up Ma Bao and Bai Xianzong to cross the river and rest for a day. Xu Jing and Liu Yining's troops were stationed in the Xuantan Temple in the north of the city. Liu Yining was resting on the kang, and Xu Jing went to Bai Xianzong to get gold wound medicine. Bai Xianzong knew about it and came to comfort him. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei also came to visit. Knowing that Liu Yining's injury was still light, they were relieved a lot and praised Liu Yining's ability to bravely kill the bandits. After sitting for a while, they heard that Wu Sangui had led his troops into the city, so they hurried to see Sangui, so they left. At dusk, Xu Jing returned to the temple alone and saw Liu Yining sleeping alone in the room. A candle as thick as an arm was lit on the table, and there was silence, with only two soldiers standing outside the door, serving Liu Yining. When Liu Yining saw Xu Jing come back, he said, "Brother Jing is back? Is General Wu about to advance? We must use our own strength to defeat the bandits, and don't rely on the strength of others." Xu Jing said, "Yes." He sat down on the edge of the kang. He also said, "General Wu said that he will advance the day after tomorrow. Tonight, he left us to drink in the camp. He knew that you were injured by an arrow when you crossed the river to kill the bandits, and he taught me to comfort you. Tomorrow morning, he will also send officials to comfort you." (23)
