### It is Rumored that Germany Plans to Convene a Conference of European Countries to Formulate Economic Revival Procedures, Excluding Britain from the Outside

United Press, Washington, 23rd: White House Secretary O'Leary told reporters yesterday that President Roosevelt had received confirmed news that Germany planned to convene a conference of European countries at the end of this year and the beginning of next year to discuss the establishment of a new European order with various countries as its puppets, and said that news from German diplomatic circles indicated that Germany, because it had sacrificed too much in the war against the Soviet Union, was preparing for this conference. O'Leary also said that the purpose advocated by Germany was to use noble words such as economic revival and the restoration of freedom to various countries, but what it actually built was nothing more than a group of puppet countries controlled by Germany behind the scenes. O'Leary also said that the message received by the President was that the Germans had submitted notifications to various Axis powers, belligerent countries, and neutral countries, except for Britain. O'Leary also said that all those who believe in democracy and resist the warlord control of Europe and the world should be fully aware of the nature of this conference.

Reuters, Washington, 23rd: White House Secretary O'Leary told reporters that the White House had learned from undisclosed sources that Germany was now planning to convene a conference to formulate procedures for the economic revival and independent restoration of European countries, and that the list of countries it intended to invite to the meeting did not include Britain. People who truly believe in democracy and oppose military rule that divides Europe and the world should not lightly believe in this plan. When asked whether Germany wanted to propose an economic peace, O'Leary did not answer directly, but said that President Roosevelt and the State Department had received intelligence that Germany intended to convene a conference. O'Leary also said that the meeting was planned to be held in December or January, at a time deemed appropriate by Germany. Among those whom Germany intended to invite to the meeting were some belligerent countries, all Axis powers, and some neutral countries.

### It is Rumored that the Three Giants of France, Germany, and Italy Will Meet to Seek to Strengthen Military Cooperation

United Press, New York, 23rd: Rome Radio reported last night that Mussolini will attend a meeting between General Petain and Hitler, which will be held in France in the near future. French reports said that Marshal Petain and Associate Darlan will meet with Air Force Commander-in-Chief Goering next week, but said that Hitler is expected not to attend the meeting. European reports said that the meeting was convened by Germany to request France to allow the dispatch of German troops to Africa, fearing that it would further allow Germany to use the French fleet to strengthen German-French cooperation.

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said recently that whether the rumored meeting between French Marshal Petain's cabinet associate Darlan and Aviation Minister Goering in the occupied areas of France is true will be proven by facts. However, since the dismissal of General Weygand, Commissioner for French Overseas Territories in Africa, whether new factors have arisen in Franco-German relations is a question that cannot be answered at this time. According to political figures here, the French government has been criticized by foreign governments for exercising its sovereignty within the scope of the armistice agreement, but the United States is not motivated by humanitarian or political motives, but harbors ulterior motives. Whether the United States will take further blockade measures or even seize French territories is still difficult to judge at this time.

US-French Relations Are Hanging by a Thread

Reuters, Washington, 23rd: According to well-informed sources here, the State Department's reaction to Weygand's dismissal may not be the US's early recognition of General de Gaulle, the leader of Free France. The United States is very disappointed with the developments in French North Africa, because this development is a blow to the US policy towards French North Africa. However, according to well-informed sources, the United States may not immediately sever relations with Vichy, especially while Petain is still the French head of state and the United States has not yet severed relations with Berlin. If the United States breaks off relations with Germany, Franco-American relations will naturally break down.

### US Coal Miners Resume Work Today; Accept President's Recommendation; Dispute Submitted to Arbitration

Reuters, Washington, 23rd: The Policy Committee of the United Mine Workers of America has advocated that coal miners should resume work immediately to await the outcome of the arbitration of the steel company's coal mine dispute. Thus, the US coal mine strike has come to an end. President Roosevelt immediately appointed Steelyman, Director of the Labor Department's Mediation Service, as the public representative, Ferris, Chairman of the Board of Directors of US Steel, as the employer representative, and Lewis, the leader of the Mine Workers Union, as the labor representative, so that the meeting of the three-person arbitration panel could be held immediately. Coal mines are now gradually resuming work, and they can all work normally on Sunday.

### Manila Holds Air Raid Drill

### Former Chief of Staff of the French Air Force Joins the Free French Forces

Reuters, London, 23rd: Today, the Free French Headquarters announced that General Audic, former Chief of Staff of the French Air Force, has joined the Free French Forces. Mr. Audic was appointed Chief of Staff of the French Air Force after the armistice, and then went to the United States.

### Finland and Romania Decide to Join the Anti-Comintern Pact

### Sino-British-Australian-Dutch Warning to Japan: Strong Unity to Resist Aggression, Maintain Far East Interests, Support the US Position, US-Japan Peace or War Negotiations Have Reached a Decisive Stage

Reuters, Washington, 23rd – US Secretary of State Hull, Japanese Ambassador Nomura, and Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu met at Hull's residence yesterday afternoon for three hours. Subsequently, according to State Department officials, there were no special new developments. Continued talks are expected to be held early next week. Nomura and Kurusu made no comments on the talks.

United Press, Washington, 23rd – Among the major Pacific nations – the United States, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies – as the Tokyo government attempts to decide whether to continue the negotiations initiated by its special envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura here, a terrible warning has been issued to Japan, implying that these four nations have united to resist further Japanese aggression. The ABCD powers have unanimously agreed to fully support the United States' position in the recent negotiations with Japan, and it is generally believed that Secretary of State Hull must have informed the two Japanese envoys of this situation during an informal meeting at his residence last night. The meeting of the ABCD powers yesterday is widely seen as delivering the following three points to Japan: Most nations are determined to maintain their interests in the Far East; To protect these interests, most nations firmly support US leadership; All nations will continue to impose economic sanctions on Japan until Japan demonstrates a more conciliatory attitude. After the meeting, Australian Minister Casey immediately declared, "There are absolutely no cracks among the ABCD powers that Japan believes are encircling it."

United Press, Washington, 23rd – US-Japan negotiations to decide on "peace or war" reached a critical stage yesterday. US Secretary of State Hull has held meetings with the diplomatic envoys of major countries involved in the negotiations. Attendees included British Ambassador Halifax, Dutch Minister Loudon, Australian Minister Casey, and Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih. The British, Australian, Dutch, and American diplomatic envoys met for about two hours before Hull invited Dr. Hu Shih to join the meeting. Hull then temporarily left the meeting room to meet with South American Minister Crous, who had been scheduled in advance. According to a State Department spokesperson, the meeting was purely for the "exchange of information." However, it is noteworthy that although Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih had recently recovered from an illness, Mr. Hull urged Dr. Hu to attend the meeting. Everyone in attendance thoroughly discussed the situation in the Far East yesterday. Mr. Hull apparently informed the diplomatic representatives of the progress of the US-Japan negotiations. It is reported that the reason for the negotiations is due to reports of further Japanese military actions in Vietnam and the possibility of a Japanese attack on Thailand. At the same time, a report from Bangkok stated that Thailand is implementing mobilization in a state of peace. Some quarters here speculate that the Vietnam issue is related to the Washington negotiations. Some believe that Japan is preparing to take action to strengthen the position of those attending the negotiations here. Others believe that Japanese military personnel are attempting to prevent any possibility of reconciliation with the United States, and are therefore taking unhurried steps to embarrass Japanese politicians.

United Press, Washington, 23rd – Important nations in the Pacific, including China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands, held a meeting with Hull yesterday and all agreed to support the United States' position in the recent negotiations with Japan. After the meeting, British Ambassador Halifax said, "We are all in unanimous agreement with Mr. Hull's handling of the situation." Mr. Halifax also said, "The ABCD nations have complete confidence in Mr. Hull's handling of the situation." He also confirmed that the US Secretary of State had informed the ABCD nations of the progress of the negotiations. When asked if there was hope of resolving the Pacific problem, Lord Halifax smiled and replied, "I have always been an optimist, but I do not underestimate or overestimate developments." He also said, "I believe that exploratory talks should be viewed as exploratory, without raising the temperature." Dr. Hu Shih appeared very pleased. He said that the ABCD nations have all agreed that China is not afraid of any event and has no reason to be alarmed, a clear reference to speculation that China must make concessions if the US-Japan problem can be resolved. A State Department spokesman said, "The meeting discussed all situations related to the international situation of the participating countries, and no conclusions can be discussed at this time."

International News Service, Washington, 23rd – China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands formally joined the United States yesterday in demanding that Japan immediately abandon its pro-Axis relationship and policy of aggression. After a three-hour meeting between Secretary of State Hull and senior diplomatic representatives of the four governments, the ABCD nations have organized a united front in Washington to resist Japanese aggression in the Pacific. The issue of peace or war between Japan and the United States in the Pacific is approaching a critical juncture, making the formation of the united front particularly important. Since the US-Japan talks began in Washington, this is the first time that the ABCD nations have held a joint meeting. It is reported that the diplomatic representatives in attendance agreed with the four points recently proposed by Hull to resolve the Pacific problem: Japan must withdraw from the Axis; Abandon the aggressive expansion policy; Withdraw troops from China and Vietnam; All countries have equal commercial opportunities in the Pacific. It is reported that the Japanese representative has replied that Japan may regard the Axis agreement as a dead letter, but cannot formally withdraw from the Axis, because since Japan signed the Axis treaty, successive cabinets have strongly asserted that the relationship with the Axis is the fundamental principle of Japanese policy. It is understood that Hull's attitude is firm, and he resolutely stated that if the United States and Japan want to resolve the problems between the two countries, Japan must publicly renounce the Axis. It was also revealed by authoritative sources that although China is reportedly insisting on restoring the status quo before the Manchurian Incident of 1931, the US opinion is that China must return to the position before the Japanese invasion of China in July 1937.

Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd – Japanese sources in unusually well-informed diplomatic circles are pessimistic about the talks in Washington. American diplomatic circles also believe that unless there is an incredible miracle, the tense situation cannot be eased, and American intelligence reported by local newspapers also corroborates this view. The failure of the discussions in Washington does not mean an immediate declaration of war, but will place Japan in a position where it has no choice but to take action immediately, eventually leading to war, such as coveting the Burma Road and invading Thailand, or attempting to seize war materials from the Dutch East Indies.

### Japan's Arrow of Aggression is Already on the String: Thailand Implements Mobilization, Warning People to Remain Silent to Avoid Leaking Military Secrets, Strange Aircraft Constantly Cross the Border for Reconnaissance

Reuters, Bangkok, 23rd – The Thai people are now increasingly worried that Japanese troops may soon invade Thailand. Newspapers are urging Thais to follow the authorities' orders and remain silent if they see troop movements in the country, to avoid rumors spreading and endangering the leakage of military secrets.

Reuters, Bangkok, 23rd – The well-informed "Suvarnabhumi Daily" predicts that Thailand will mobilize all its resources and place them on a wartime footing. The newspaper expects the government to submit a bill to this effect to the current parliament. According to qualified observers, whether the newspaper's prediction is accurate or not, there is no doubt that it reflects the seriousness of the situation. The "Siri Krong Daily" also assured the public that Thailand has now followed the other countries in the Far East in implementing armaments and that the war in the Far East will surely come, and Thailand will inevitably be drawn into the vortex.

Reuters, Chongqing, 23rd – Chinese officials attach great importance to the Japanese invasion of the Thai border, believing that this unexpected incident was intentionally created to test whether Britain and the United States will genuinely help Thailand if it is attacked and to what extent the joint plans of Thailand, Britain, and the United States have progressed. At the same time, it is said that this unexpected incident will be a further oppression of Thailand.

Reuters, Bangkok, 23rd – Local newspapers reported that aircraft of unknown nationality repeatedly invaded the Thai border from Vietnam. According to reports, one aircraft flew over the Nakhon Si Thammarat airfield on the southern coast of Thailand in the forenoon of November 17th and 18th, circling for half an hour, and then flying east across the Gulf of Siam. On November 20th, two French aircraft flew over the Mekong River from the direction of Vietnam's Chak and conducted reconnaissance flights over Nakhon Phanom in Thai territory.

### Japan-Vietnam Relations: Seeking Ways to Resolve Certain Difficult Issues

### British Warships Continuously Sail to the Far East: Singapore's Defenses are Consolidated, British and American Navies Cooperate Effectively, A Factor for Stabilizing the Pacific

United Press, Singapore, 23rd – Singapore officials have repeatedly pointed out that what Vice Admiral Layton said before, "The naval power of this naval base here must be a factor for stability in the Far East," will be proven in the near future. It is generally recognized that the timely arrival of the British fleet has had a changing effect on Japan's claims to move south. The navy maintains secrecy. All parties acknowledge that Churchill's guaranteed naval reinforcement in the Pacific is not merely a threat as Japanese newspapers believe. Well-informed sources expect the development of unified British and American naval command in the Pacific, with sufficient strength to support Churchill and President Roosevelt's warnings to prevent aggressors in the Far East.

Reuters, Cairo, 23rd – A Reuters correspondent reports that the New Zealand troops' capture of the Gaps Fort is of great significance, as it proves that the British mobile forces advancing from the south have now reached the rear of the Axis forces stationed around Solum and Halfaya Pass, putting these enemy troops at risk of being attacked from both sides.

Havas Agency, New York, 22nd – According to dispatches received here from Cairo, British troops who had been defending Tobruk Harbor for several months broke out yesterday in order to make contact with the British mechanized forces attacking Libya. They have now broken through the German-Italian encirclement and advanced five miles.

Reuters, Cairo, 23rd – According to war reports received here today from various sources, the British offensive in the Western Desert continues to unfold very successfully. The British Air Force has maintained its superiority throughout. It is expected that the war will end in another two or three days. Officials say that the action of the British army surrounding the Axis forces between Halfaya and Omar is progressing very satisfactorily. It is reported that American-made tanks have taken the lead and achieved the results of capturing Gaps and destroying a large number of Axis tanks and armored vehicles. The scope of this war may be one of the largest in history. Its battlefield starts from Gaps, forty-five miles southeast of Tobruk, and reaches Lech. According to the headquarters bulletin, General Cunningham used the strategic opportunity he had gained to place his armored main force in the middle of the German tank concentration points on both the east and west sides. Although the German tank force repeatedly attempted to break through to the west, it ultimately failed. Although the losses of both sides cannot be estimated at present, it is known that the enemy's losses are still greater than those of the British. British troops in Tobruk, with a large number of tanks gradually transported in by the British Navy for many weeks, launched a surprise attack on Friday morning, hoping to make contact with the British troops occupying Lech. Before long, they seized three important enemy strongholds three miles northeast of Tobruk, and a smaller stronghold nearby. At night, the troops in Tobruk still made progress despite fierce resistance.

British Air Force Carries Out Extensive Activities, Flying Fortresses Come Out to Assist in the Battle

Reuters, Cairo, 23rd – A British Air Force bulletin stated that on Friday, British fighter planes and bombers carried out extensive activities in the Libyan campaign. Flying Fortress planes also came out to assist in the battle, fiercely bombing Ghazala. Enemy tanks and motor transport vehicles in other places such as Bardia were also bombed. An enemy fighter plane was strafed by a British bomber, caught fire, and crashed. British fighter planes also went out on large-scale patrols and attacked enemy planes whenever they encountered them, shooting down and destroying eight enemy planes in total. Ground fire also shot down a German fighter plane. It is confirmed that thirty-seven enemy fighter planes were destroyed on Thursday, and the previous report of twenty-two was inaccurate. Five British planes that went into battle are missing.

Allied Forces Adopt Encirclement Strategy, German Army Still Fights Like a Cornered Beast

Reuters, London, 23rd – According to the opinions of various observers, since the New Zealand troops captured the Gaps Fort, the Libyan war has developed into four military operations. The British Air Force's control of the skies over the Western Desert has proven to be of great assistance to the land army. There are fierce battles between Omar and Halfaya. The British army has taken encirclement actions to annihilate the German armored forces holding the positions. Further west, there is a major battle in the triangle between Lech, Gaps, and a small village about 45 miles southeast of Tobruk. The main force of German tanks there is fighting like a cornered beast, hoping to regain contact with the armored forces west of Tobruk. The defenders of Tobruk are now gradually advancing southeast towards the outer perimeter defense line, but have encountered strong resistance.

International News Service, New York, 23rd – Military expert Captain Kracht discussed the Libyan war situation, saying that based on news from all sides, the British offensive in Libya continues to be favorable to the British. It is reported that at least two German-Italian strong tank forces are surrounded on the Egyptian border and cut off from the main force. The British also said that many German tanks and armored vehicles have been destroyed. It can be seen that since the British army launched its offensive, the Axis mechanized forces have suffered heavy losses. The next few days may be the most critical moment in the overall situation, which will determine the victory or defeat of the battle. It is estimated that the Axis armored forces surrounded are two or three German tank divisions stationed in North Africa. If the British claim that this tank division has been completely defeated is true, and if the British army can strengthen the encirclement, enough to eliminate the German-Italian army, then the British army will have the possibility of continuing to penetrate into Libya, and may even reach Tripoli.

Editorial

### The Importance of the Far East Five-Power Conference

Yesterday, representatives from the five countries of China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia held an important meeting in Washington. On the surface, it was an "exchange of information," but in reality, it was certainly related to the US-Japan talks, which are approaching a decisive stage. Since the US-Japan talks began, this is the first time that representatives from the five powers with direct relations to the Pacific situation have held a plenary meeting. The importance of its nature is self-evident. Although it cannot be said that the future of peace or war in the Pacific has been decided by this ABCD meeting, it can at least be said that the joint position of the democratic camp in dealing with Japan has been further confirmed by this collective discussion. British Ambassador Halifax stated after the meeting that "all the countries participating in the meeting have reached complete agreement and unanimously support the position taken by the United States in its talks with Japan." At the same time, Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih, who attended the meeting despite being ill, expressed "pleasure" after the meeting and resolutely declared that "China is not panicking about any event and has no reason to be alarmed." Then, at least it can be inferred that the United States' position in its talks with Japan remains firm, in other words, it still insists on an anti-aggression attitude.

In parallel with this five-power conference, there are reports that the US-Japan talks have encountered difficulties. At the same time, according to Reuters dispatches, it seems that the Tokyo side is also expressing pessimism about the future of the talks. Assuming that the US-Japan talks have developed to a certain extent, making it necessary for the countries concerned to hold a joint meeting to decide how to deal with the situation, then undoubtedly, one side of the talks must have formally notified the other side of the terms it has put forward, either accepting or rejecting them or proposing an alternative plan. According to reports from earlier today, Hull had notified Kurusu and Nomura that "President Roosevelt absolutely cannot agree to take the Tojo Two Principles as the basis for talks." On the same day, United Press also issued a message stating that Hull had put forward four principles: Japan withdraws from the Axis; Stop moving south and north; Withdraw troops from China and Vietnam; Guarantee Japan equal economic opportunities in the Pacific region. If these two pieces of news are true, then undoubtedly, Japan must have replied to Hull, telling him that at most it can accept some of these four principles. Let us assume that Japan can fully accept the second principle, but expresses that it cannot publicly withdraw from the Axis for the first principle, and can only continue to maintain neutrality in the European war; for the third principle, it expresses that the United States must assist in resolving the "China Incident"; for the fourth principle, it expresses that Japan must enjoy "privileges." In this way, on the surface, it seems that Japan has made considerable concessions, but in reality, it is still "deceitful talk" and treats President Roosevelt as a "fool," thinking that such "concessions" can be exchanged for the United States' "peace." Leaving aside what the Washington authorities think of such bargaining, even the representatives of the four countries of China, Britain, the Netherlands, and Australia who attended the meeting yesterday would probably sneer at it! Because today, anyone should recognize that Japan has long been "terminally ill." The "expansion craze" it suffers from cannot be suppressed by any diplomatic negotiations or paper agreements. Its "established national policy" has long become a consistent policy of successive cabinets. All it is waiting for is a "suitable opportunity." No matter what kind of compromise it reaches with the United States, it will never be able to keep its word in the end. Unless Japan can be disarmed voluntarily, it will inevitably have a day when it will still use future "opportunities" to launch new offensives due to the drive of internal and external environments. Therefore, the United States will not want to reach an agreement with Japan, but if it still wants to negotiate a concrete result in order to stabilize the overall situation in the Far East, then at a minimum, it must insist on the above four principles, because otherwise, it would be disloyal to the entire democratic camp in the Far East, and it would be tantamount to making trouble for itself. With the wisdom of Roosevelt and Hull, we dare to assert that they will never be so foolish.

Conversely, from Japan's perspective, if the Tojo cabinet fully accepts the four principles put forward by Hull without any discount, then Tojo will fall. If it does not accept them and cannot reach a compromise with the United States, then Tojo has no choice but to take a risk, or he will have to resign. Therefore, thinking about the current Tojo cabinet, if the Washington authorities still insist on their original position after the five-power conference and are unwilling to make any concessions, then this brand-new military cabinet has only two choices: "action" and "resignation." In fact, for the above reasons, the United States represents not only its own interests in these talks with Japan, but also the interests of the entire democratic camp in the Far East. The convening of yesterday's five-power conference is clear evidence of this. Therefore, even from the standpoint of the four countries of China, Britain, the Netherlands, and Australia, the United States must not be satisfied with an incomplete compromise. In other words, for the sake of the safety of the entire Far East, the United States must insist that Japan completely change its attitude in these talks with Japan, that is, completely abandon its policy of aggression. The United States must not gamble the safety of its allies on an unreliable guarantee from Japan. Therefore, it can be asserted that unless Japan fully accepts the Hull principles this time, it will have no more opportunities for trickery or deception. The common position decided by the five-power conference is the death knell for Japan's speculative diplomacy.

### Nazi Troops Heavily Reinforced, Launching a General Offensive on Soviet Capital, Germany Claims Breakthrough of Tula Soviet Defense Line

Reuters, Moscow, 23rd—A city named Klin, located northwest of Moscow, is now mentioned in the latest Soviet communiqué. It is reported that particularly fierce battles took place yesterday in Klin, Volokolamsk, Tula, and the Rostov-on-Don region.

Havas, Moscow, 22nd—Local radio stations have just announced that the fighting on the Moscow front is exceptionally fierce. Soviet troops are still putting up strong resistance on all lines, but in several places, they have been forced to retreat. Heavy fighting occurred day and night yesterday on the Volokolamsk front. German forces reinforced the Mogaisk front with four fresh divisions, attempting to break through the Soviet defenses, launching repeated attacks without cease.

United Press, Berlin, 23rd—Following the announcement yesterday of the capture of Rostov, the German side also claimed that German armored units made a new breakthrough south of Moscow yesterday and are now driving large forces from this location into the northern line of the Soviet capital. The newly breached location is likely in the Tula area, as German forces there are driving large armies towards the north and south lines.

Reuters, London, 23rd—Tula is one of the most important outer defense lines leading to Moscow. The fighting on its main roads is now intensifying daily. According to Soviet news agencies, the German side has brought in fresh troops to assist in the battle, and Tula is now putting up an increasingly difficult defense. All residents are engaged in building defensive works or have been called up for military service, with the sole aim of repelling the enemy. However, even though the city is on the front lines, shops and medical institutions are still operating as usual.

German Gambles on Last Effort Before Cold – Battlefield Piled with Thousands of Corpses

Reuters, Kuibyshev, 23rd—According to the latest front-line reports received by TASS, the German offensive launched on Moscow two days ago is the last desperate effort before the arrival of winter. However, it has so far failed to break through the Soviet defenses and has made little progress. Fierce fighting continues on the main roads leading to Moscow. The fields and roads around Moscow are littered with thousands upon thousands of German corpses, and the wreckage of tanks and armored vehicles is also scattered along the way. Although the enemy has a greater number of tanks, they have failed to penetrate deep into Soviet positions. However, the Soviet forces have occasionally abandoned one or two strongholds, retreating to new, pre-arranged positions and launching counter-attacks. The enemy attacked in the direction of Mogaisk with four divisions of infantry but was repulsed after half a day of fighting. German forces launched fierce attacks on Soviet positions in the areas of Maloyaroslavets and Roslavl but were driven back by Soviet artillery fire. There was fighting near Novgorod, 90 miles south of Leningrad. Soviet artillery destroyed 37 enemy cannons, 16 mortars, and several ammunition vehicles, and annihilated approximately 4,000 German soldiers.

### 川江 Journey (3)

— Ji Sheng

The next morning, I saw another lively scene. The towpath followed the left bank up a steep hill. On the hill was a temple. Forty or fifty people were gathered on the narrow road in front of the temple, making a lot of noise. Among this crowd, three or five were selling peanuts and rice noodle cakes, and another three or five were long-distance travelers resting their feet like us. The rest of the group was issuing rhythmic roars, fighting the rapids.

Wu Zixu bumped through Wenzhao Pass...

Ah ha, ah ha...

Zhao Zilong single-handedly rescues A'dou

Ah ha, ah ha...

A man with a clear face and neat clothes, about thirty years old, stretched his neck, his face flushed, standing in the crowd, turning left and right, singing opera lines. His hands moved non-stop in the air, like keeping time, like conducting. Under him was a group of hunched-over, roaring trackers, each of whom walked to the upper hand of the temple and turned down again, using tow boards and ropes to attach to the bamboo cables just placed on the rocks and walk forward. Their steps were as neat as their roars. Their shoulders and backs were purple, and they were covered in sweat, trying to pull a heavily loaded boat, which had fallen more than ten zhang downstream, to the middle of the rapids, under the rocks. As the boat approached the shore, a dozen or so trackers hurried down the rocks, jumped onto the boat, and took up bamboo poles to work; some used the bamboo poles to hold against the rocks at the bow to avoid collisions, some used the iron hooks on the other end of the bamboo poles to hook the holes in the rocks, and some simply撑directly forward. The noisy shouting, the chaotic footsteps, the clear sound of iron hooks hitting the rocks, and the衝擊 between the raging tide and the wooden boat, were interwoven into another kind of fighting sound.

On the shore, the caller and some of the trackers sat under the eaves, eating rice noodle cakes, only two people were assigned to pull one end of the bamboo cable on the shore, looped around the rocks eight or nine zhang upstream. The wooden boat gradually left the shore, and the sailors on the boat raised their oars and rowed vigorously across the rapids. The boat was pushed back by the water, and the slack bamboo cable became taut. Suddenly, bursts of silvery-white浪花 splashed in all directions, and the dozen or so oars became disordered and rapid, losing their original rhythm. At this time, the boat had reached the mainstream. Soon, the tension on the boat suddenly decreased, the number of oars decreased, and bamboo poles were seen flying in the air again. Here, the bamboo cable looped around the rocks was released, and a white dragon穿went straight across the river, disappearing on the side of the boat. The boat reached the other shore and slowly rowed into the quiet Wenhe River, and the dozen sailors jumped ashore to carry the cables.

Our boat was actually carried to the foot of the rocks by two trackers. We were greeted onto the boat and rowed towards the other shore. Not long after leaving the shore, we saw the group in front of the temple helping the boatmen of another heavily loaded boat that had just gone up the slope.

Ya... ya... ya...

Ah ha, ah ha...

They started singing again. I learned later that this group of trackers, led by the old caller in front of the temple, worked like this forever, and they were professionals who "pulled滩."

"The Shu Road is harder than ascending to青天" This is the feeling of the upstream客 and mountain climbers. If you go downstream, you won't have this idea in your 心裏.

Depart from Baidi in the colorful clouds of dawn, return to Jiangling in a thousand li in a day.

The sounds of apes on both banks cannot be stopped, the light boat has already passed over ten thousand重山!

In order to envy this kind of 快意 travel, I often like to find opportunities to take downstream boats.

During the summer vacation, I took two sections of wooden boats back to Chongqing. The wooden boat, which was scheduled to depart at 6 o'clock, was delayed until 9 o'clock due to the poor ticketing method, which made us passengers, who were punctual and could not have more breakfast, anxious. "Farewell! Leshan", the boat was released into the mainstream of the Minjiang River,飘飘荡荡, came to the confluence of the Minjiang River and the Dadu River. The roar of the Dadu River, the sobs of the Minjiang River, plus the boatmen's efforts to push the oars, the boat was quickly sent through the rapids. The漩涡 still floated non-stop, but the water flow was much slower. I thought: This is the section where the boatmen should row harder. Who knows, the facts were contrary to my imagination. Six oars were斜 inserted on both sides of the舷 like pairs of treasure swords, and the boatmen were either sitting or lying on the bow,吸 smoking and "摆龙门阵" (talking). After our conversation and inquiries, we realized a little about their theory of going downstream: "推滩不推平" "Slow boats run faster than fast horses", as long as it is not急流险滩, let the boat go down with the water渦, it is already very fast, why be so anxious? However, the boat owner, who was in charge of the rudder, often urged the boatmen to "推呀! "推呀", he took the excuse that the boat was small and there were many passengers, so it was impossible to cook, so he only stopped for a short time. It was not until one o'clock in the afternoon that all the passengers on the boat could no longer endure the pain of hunger, thirst, and expansion of 排泄物, and stated that they would take care of their own meals and forced the boat to stop, which he agreed to. At this time, the boat had traveled more than one hundred and thirty 里. (This is　里, one　里 is about one-third of a kilometer, two-thirds of a 市里.)

### The French Police Department Strictly Enforces Laws, Businesses Severely Punished for Raising Prices, Licenses of Five Cigarette Shops Revoked, Three Pharmacies and Grocery Stores Sealed, Price Limits Must Be Implemented Gradually, Hoping the Public Will Be Patient

The French Concession Police Department, in order to stipulate that retail stores must not exceed the stipulated price limits, issued a notice yesterday, "All retailers selling various imported goods must follow the prices stipulated by the authorities, as published in foreign newspapers. Each retailer can obtain the price list from the police station in charge."

Licenses of Five Stores Revoked

The French Concession Police Department, according to the price control regulations, seized a large quantity of stockpiled soap at Tianli Cigarette Shop at 252 Avenue Edward VII, Hengxing Cigarette Shop at 309, Dayousheng Candle Shop at 452, Congxingxiang Cigarette Shop at 133 Rue Wagner, and Qiaoyuan Cigarette Shop at 274 Ningxing Street, and revoked their business licenses. Several of them were selling at prices exceeding the maximum price limit stipulated by the French Municipal Council, or were hiding goods in an attempt to sell them at higher prices. Such actions, according to the price control regulations promulgated by the French Consulate General, should be severely punished. It can be seen that the price limits for retail goods set by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement are also implemented in the French Concession.

Three Price-Gouging Stores Closed

It is reported that the first store in the French Concession to be punished by the authorities for violating the price limits was Renjia Pharmacy at 601 Avenue Joffre. After the Shanghai Municipal Council announced the price limits, the pharmacy continued to sell Carnation milk powder above the price limits. The French Police Department sent police to investigate and confirmed the facts and seized three cans of Carnation milk powder. The store owner was taken to the police station and sentenced to one week of suspension. According to an investigation by a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the French Police Department also ordered the closure of Yudaxiang North Goods and Seafood Shop at 25 Rue Cardinal Mercier and Fengtai Canned Food Shop at 47 Rue Cardinal Mercier, which sold goods above the price limits.

Decisive Action Pleases the Public

It is reported that since the two concessions actively implemented price controls, prices have gradually stabilized. However, some unscrupulous merchants are still acting insincerely, hiding some goods in secret rooms and refusing to sell them at the limited price, which is a major obstacle to the authorities' price management. Therefore, the authorities of both concessions have announced to the public, hoping to report speculative profiteering behavior. The French Concession is particularly decisive. The aforementioned retailers stockpiled a large quantity of soap and refused to sell it, or raised the price. Dayousheng Candle Shop even built a waterproof cement cellar under the ground, specializing in stockpiling goods, with soap being the largest. It is rumored that all the seized soap will be confiscated as a warning to those who hoard and speculate. Currently, the aforementioned stores whose licenses have been revoked have a paper seal pasted on their doors, which reads, "This store is ordered to suspend business by the Police Department for selling goods above the price limit." People who see it express great satisfaction.

Price Notices Dared to Be Torn Down

Since the authorities of the two concessions began to manage price increases and announced the suppression of the prices of various daily necessities, yesterday morning, they printed the published prices of goods in English on forms and posted them on the walls next to cigarette and grocery stores within the concessions for reference during sales. However, some shameless stores regarded the law as a mere scrap of paper and tore down the price list. A reporter from Daguan News Agency passed by Fuchang North Goods Incense and Candle Shop at 197 Rue Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession yesterday morning and saw two apprentices tearing down the price list posted by the French authorities at the entrance. The reporter stepped forward to ask the reason, but the two apprentices gave no answer. As someone openly tore down the price list posted by the authorities, the intention was to be dissatisfied with the price limited by the authorities, and they should be sanctioned urgently.

Wartime Controls Value Speed

Mr. Felippe, Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told reporters the day before yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Council was replying to letters published in the newspaper for the first time, but he was very interested in a letter signed "Fair" published in the "Letter to the Editor" column of the North-China Daily News and was willing to take this opportunity to discuss it. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council recently published the announcement on the maximum retail price limits for controlled goods, it is well known that some retailers will inevitably encounter some difficulties as a result. However, if the regulations on retail prices can be carefully considered and take into account all aspects so that all parties do not feel difficulties, then the purchase price of the goods purchased by each retailer before must be investigated. If so, the control of retail prices may be delayed to this day and still not be implemented. The excessive speculation and profiteering of retailers has become an open secret. For the sake of public interest, the Shanghai Municipal Council has no choice but to quickly implement price controls regardless of the difficulties of some people. Once wartime economy is implemented, it is inevitable that some people will encounter difficulties. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to mention the dissatisfaction expressed by many people about the slowness of the strict implementation of the maximum price limits received by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Announced Price Limits Have Been Carefully Verified

The implementation of price controls is a major matter that cannot be completed in a hurry. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that this measure must be implemented gradually. I hope that those who support the price control measure must be patient. It must be known that the publication of the maximum retail prices of various goods must be thoroughly investigated by the Shanghai Municipal Council or the trade associations cooperating with the Shanghai Municipal Council, otherwise the result will be more harm than good. An early publication is not only unfair but may also cause unnecessary price increases. The Shanghai Municipal Council is doing its best to expand its price control mechanism and implement it as soon as possible. It is hoped that the public will have a spirit of patience and cooperation with the Shanghai Municipal Council. Any constructive suggestions are welcome.

### Panama Ship Still Aground After Stranding, Not Yet Rescued, Work Difficult Due to Bad Weather

According to shipping sources, it has been confirmed that all 200 passengers on the Japanese ship Basaimaru (transliteration), which sank outside Wusongkou on the 17th, were tragically lost. Efforts are now being made to salvage the bodies. Also, the Panama ship Santa Inez, which ran aground 25 miles outside Wusongkou on the evening of the 19th, is currently undergoing rescue work. However, due to the bad weather in recent days, the ship has been severely battered by huge waves. Although the Carmen Maller, which was hired to undertake the salvage work, has made all preparations, it has been unable to start work.

### Jianghai Customs Commissioner Luo Fude Completed His Term Yesterday

Luo Fude, an Englishman and Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, has served in the Chinese Customs for 36 years and as Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs for 7 years. As of yesterday, his term has expired, and he has decided to retire. As a result of the Japanese Consul General Horiuchi Kansei's urging of the Inspector General of Customs, Merleau, it was decided to appoint Akayada Tasuke, Commissioner of the Qingdao Customs, as his successor. The vacant position of Commissioner of the Qingdao Customs will be temporarily filled by Goffredo, an Italian and Deputy Commissioner of the Qingdao Customs. It is reported that Akayada, who served as the Jianghai Customs Administrative Commissioner last year, arrived in Shanghai by the Dalian Maru from Qingdao on the 19th and announced his assumption of office yesterday.

### First Batch of Withdrawing U.S. Troops to Depart for Philippines Tomorrow

The first U.S. troop transport ship Madison President (9,000 tons), which arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 p.m. on the 21st of this month, will depart from Shanghai for Manila on the 25th. It is reported that the first batch of withdrawing U.S. troops, more than 130 in number, is scheduled to board the ship on the 24th. As for the second troop transport ship Harrison President, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai today and is scheduled to depart on the 29th. The U.S. troops on the Madison President will be led by a military band and will march in formation from Jing'an Temple Road via Nanjing Road to the Bund.

### Most of the British and American Nationals Withdrawing from Shanghai Are Women, Children, and Missionaries, Those Who Have Jobs and Do Business in Shanghai Say They Are Unwilling to Give Up Their Rights

According to foreign sources yesterday, some British nationals are currently packing their luggage in preparation for withdrawing on the Anhui, which will arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. It is also known that some of the American nationals who plan to leave Shanghai on the Madison President on the 25th are those who came to Shanghai from North China and other inland areas some days ago to gather and wait for the ship. Most of them are American missionaries. It is reported that most of the cabins on the Madison President, which arrived in Shanghai on the 21st, and the Harrison President, which is about to arrive in Shanghai, are occupied by the U.S. Navy's Fourth Marine Regiment withdrawing from Shanghai. Of the remaining 200 cabins, 150 have already been reserved by American nationals. Of the British and American nationals withdrawing from Shanghai this time, four-fifths are women and children. Most of the British and American nationals who currently have jobs and do business in Shanghai say that they are unwilling to give up their rights in Shanghai unless it is absolutely necessary.

About 600 British Nationals Withdrawing

According to the Japanese-language Tairiku Shinpo, after the British Embassy repeatedly advised British nationals in China to withdraw, a considerable number of British nationals who have followed the advice and departed from Hankou and Tianjin have arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, when they withdraw from Shanghai in the future, it is estimated that the total number, including those who have come to Shanghai from various places, will reach more than 600. They will withdraw to India. The British ship Anhui, which will transport British nationals withdrawing, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th, but the date of departure has not yet been announced.

### Christmas is Coming, Comfort Activities

As Christmas is approaching in a blink of an eye, the expatriate community of this port, in order to show their concern for their motherland's soldiers and to show their solidarity, has initiated various comfort activities.

French Free Forces

The French僑民 in Shanghai who support the continuation of the war, and the侨民 of all countries who sympathize with the French Free Forces, have launched a campaign to raise Christmas comfort donations for the French Free Forces. As of yesterday, they have received 50,000 yuan in national currency. The donations are scheduled to end on the first of next month, and then be remitted to General Tegore in London.

British侨民 Support Soldiers

The British侨民 wartime central donation in this port has nearly reached one million. Recently, the association remitted the donations to the Egyptian Chamber of Commerce, the British Navy Comfort General Association, and the National Red Cross, and has received letters of thanks.

Comfort Child Refugees

The movement to comfort child refugees of all countries launched by the Shanghai Children's Home has achieved good results since it began. The donations will be delivered to the embassies and consulates of all countries in Shanghai during Christmas, and then forwarded to child refugee relief organizations in various countries.

### U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Not Replaced

According to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 22nd, Truitt, Second Secretary of the U.S. Embassy, has left Chongqing and flown to Hong Kong to take up the post of U.S. Consul General. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, as there was no news of a replacement for the Consul General in Shanghai, the matter was very sudden, so he visited the U.S. Consulate General on Jiangxi Road. Yesterday was a holiday, and the Consul on duty replied that the U.S. Consulate had not received any orders regarding the replacement of the Consul General and did not believe that the Consul General would be replaced. The rumor that Truitt was coming to Shanghai to take up a position in the consulate was completely unfounded. Although Consul General Lockhart is currently on sick leave and his duties are being performed by Consul Stanton, Lockhart has recently recovered and will be discharged from the hospital after a few more days of recuperation and will return to work. The reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency also noted that the United Press dispatch was not published and he did not know what the original text was, so he inquired with the United Press. After investigation, it was clarified that the original telegram only stated that Truitt was coming to Shanghai to take up a position in the U.S. Consulate and did not say anything about "going to Shanghai to take up the position of Consul General there." Therefore, this was clearly due to the translator's negligence and mistook a deer for a horse. Truitt's original name is Dium Right, and he is the Second Secretary of the Embassy.

### Shanghai Municipal Council May Dismiss Many More Foreign Seamen, All Employees Anxious

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's dredger Jianshe has been requisitioned by the Japanese and the crew has been dismissed, the crew members believe that the Council's action is unreasonable and have requested severance pay equivalent to five years' wages, the last month's salary to be paid as usual, and compensation for bedding and luggage lost on the ship during the Battle of Shanghai. After the above request was made, the Council has agreed to reply within next week, and it is still difficult to predict whether it will be satisfactory. One wave has not subsided, and another has risen. Simas (Jewish), an engineer in the Council's dredging department, has drafted a list of 36 foreign seamen, including Yang Fuquan, who are to be dismissed. All employees are extremely anxious upon hearing this news and sincerely hope that the Council will automatically cancel the dismissal in order to maintain the employees' livelihoods.

### Tram Company Requests Price Increase, Shanghai Municipal Council Temporarily Ignores, Because the Council Is Actively Suppressing Prices, Public Transportation Agencies Should Not Increase Prices

Since the British Tram Company in the International Settlement increased fares by as much as 90% in September of this year, it is heard that the company has recently requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to increase fares by 50% to 60% from December 1st. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that the Council is currently actively suppressing prices and that trams are a public transportation agency and should not increase prices, so it has decided to temporarily ignore the company's request.

### French Concession Sets Up Rice Warehouse, Handling Group Rice Purchases, Deadline for This Month is the 26th, Applications for Next Month Scheduled to Begin in Early Month

The French Police Department issued a notice yesterday for the handling of group rice purchases, "A rice warehouse for issuing monthly rice requirements for factories, businesses, etc. with more than 30 employees has been set up on the open space of the McLellan Police Station. The issuance of rice allocated for November will stop on the evening of the 26th of this month, and the police stations will stop receiving application forms for November allocation at noon on the 24th of this month. As for application forms for December allocation, they can be submitted to the police stations every morning from December 1st (Monday) to December 5th (Friday) and from December 8th (Monday) to December 12th (Friday). The rice warehouse will also be open during the same period."

Second Collective Trading

According to reporters, the procedures for the first phase of collective rice trading of 20,000 bags of rice have been completed. After the French Concession Bureau opened the Xuehuali Road Gongji Warehouse and the Masnan Road Fengcheng Warehouse for delivery, there is no shortage of rice in the rice shops. The Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association began the second phase of collective rice trading registration yesterday. Rice shops in the city that need to purchase more rice can register at the Rice Shop Industry Association on Shanhai Pass Road. After the association compiles the list, the Bean and Rice Industry Association will convene a meeting to discuss the allocation plan within days.

Hoarders Secretly Transport Flour from Pudong

Since the authorities of the two concessions controlled rice, they also strictly controlled flour. The price of flour quickly fell from more than 60 yuan per bag to more than 30 yuan. As a result, hoarders secretly transported large quantities of stored flour out of the concessions. However, the flour within the two concessions could not be moved due to the authorities' ban. Therefore, they secretly transported the flour stored in warehouses in Pudong out of the concessions, resulting in a distorted phenomenon where the price of flour in the concessions was different from the price of flour in the warehouses in Pudong. The flour in the concessions was 40 yuan per bag, while the flour in the warehouses in Pudong reached 50 yuan per bag. Although there are more than one million bags of flour stored in the city, this stored flour is very important for the people's livelihood in the city before the arrival of cheap flour. It is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention and quickly stop it.

### Tofu Industry Calls on Shanghai Municipal Council for Attention

The tofu industry in the city has sent representatives to appeal to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council to lower the price of beans, and has also investigated the quantity of beans and supply situation in each shop. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council attach great importance to it and will not only prevent the industry from raising prices, which would increase the burden on the common people, but will also investigate the purchase and sale prices from the bean merchants for verification.

### Chinese Engineers Shouldering Reconstruction Work

— Yu Bin

Dr. Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs, is a renowned geologist and metallurgist. Under his leadership, ten thousand Chinese engineers are currently engaged in industrial and other industries related to the war effort, as well as transportation, mining, metallurgy, and the construction of Free China.

Chen Lifu, Minister of Education, obtained a doctorate in engineering from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, USA. Under Chen's guidance, thousands of young students are studying at universities and specialized colleges to become engineers. Free China recognizes the importance of engineers to wartime industry and construction, and the engineers are not failing to meet expectations.

Throughout China's five-thousand-year history, engineers have made their greatest contribution to the lives of this agricultural nation. Therefore, Yu the Great is known as China's hydraulic engineer. Today, engineers are essential for building canals and dikes for irrigation, dredging rivers, and surveying waterways.

Modern Chinese engineers, recognizing the slow pace of improving military equipment and modernizing it, have become ordnance experts. In recent years, ordnance engineers have been joined by a large number of graduates from engineering, chemistry, and physics, all of whom have received advanced training at the ordnance schools established by the Ministry of War.

Before the war, the aviation industry was in its infancy. Over the past four years, through the continuous efforts of engineers from various disciplines, in addition to the state-owned aircraft factories, great achievements that would have taken many years have been accomplished. Chemical and civil engineers have also made their greatest efforts in preparing for air raids.

Military, civil, and communications engineers, in addition to serving in armories and aircraft factories, are also very active in war-related duties. The guiding engineers and senior mechanical engineers currently serving in the mechanized units are truly the hope for forming a modern army.

The successful relocation of factories to the west proves the efforts of Chinese engineers in responding to extraordinary times. The fact that mechanical factories were able to resume operations within three weeks of arriving at their destination is a testament to the hard work of their chief engineers. In addition to manufacturing ordnance parts, they are also engaged in the manufacture of agricultural and industrial tools, as well as generators and other machinery. Generators and machinery suitable for the chemical industry are manufactured under wartime conditions using very simple tools. As a result, Chinese engineers have become increasingly confident in their ability to succeed.

Automobile engineers have been able to improve gasoline vehicles to use charcoal, alcohol, tung oil, and other vegetable oils. At the same time, chemists have completed the manufacture of alcohol, refining of tung oil, distillation of bituminous coal, and compression of coal gas. The success of most industries is due to the needs of the war and the genius of Chinese engineers.

Mining engineers use machines relocated inland and improved local methods to mine coal, iron, gold, lead, tin, antimony, mercury, silver, copper, and other minerals. Metallurgists are responsible for smelting and refining. Civil engineers build railways, highways, airfields, bridges, and buildings. The 600 kilometers of railway that have been completed, the hundreds of kilometers of railway under construction, the 5,000 kilometers of highway that have been completed, and the 4,900 kilometers of highway under construction are all proof of the harvest of these efforts.

New power plants commonly used in wartime industry, using steam or hydropower, have been completed to supply electricity. Electrical engineers have laid a foundation for the electrification of the Northwest and Southwest, with achievements that cannot be compared to those before the war.

Textile engineers manage new-style cotton and wool textile factories in West China. Before the war, only Shaanxi had one new-style cotton textile factory. The center of the textile industry is now concentrated in Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong.

Chemical engineers are currently engaged in bleaching pig bristles, reeling silk, refining tung oil, melting tea leaves, and other agricultural products for export. Engineers engaged in food preservation and canning are very important to the military and civilians.

Machinery purchased before the war that was left unused has now been put to use. Local methods used a century ago have now been improved to compensate for the lack of mechanical products. The theories that scholars learned before the war have advanced to the stage of practical application, and most have gone from theorists to practitioners.

### Gong Wu Stage Attacked by Two Bombs

At the Gong Wu Stage, next door to the Great World amusement park on Avenue Edward VII, at around 9 p.m. on the 22nd, while the second act of the "Strange Hero Ouyang De" was being performed, as the stage scenery was being changed and the electric lights were turned off, unexpectedly someone from the upper gallery threw two hand grenades, which landed in front of the stage door, causing a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke. One spectator was hit in the face by a piece of shrapnel, bleeding profusely. The audience panicked and rushed to escape through the doors. Afterwards, the theater authorities immediately ordered the servants to close the iron gates, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. When the French police heard the alarm and arrived in police cars, the bomber could not be apprehended. Later, an ambulance was summoned to take the injured person to the hospital for treatment.

### Two Shops Violate Weights and Measures, Defraud Customers, Fined

The Tongxingxiang Rice Shop at No. 495 Yichang Road and the Wanggongxing Meat Shop at No. 1053 Tokyo Road, on the 17th of this month, were both found to be using inaccurate weights and measures to defraud customers of their property. This was discovered by French Detective Fernandagan, who manages weights and measures for the Public Security Bureau, and Chinese Detective Fan Youyou of the Putuo Road Police Station. They reported this to the First Special District Court, which issued summonses to the owners of the two shops, Zhao Songshou and Han Baozhen, to appear before the Eighth Criminal Court. The Public Security Bureau's lawyer, Peng Qixi, prosecuted them for using weights and measures that violated the prescribed standards under Article 208 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Qiu, they were each severely punished.

### Murderer Yang Jiaju Dies of Illness in Prison

Yang Jiaju (also known as Xiao Yang, residing at No. 110, Lane 315, Tongfu Road), a Cantonese, previously committed murders and other terrorist acts within the Public Concession with Yongxing (also known as Chaofan, Zhu Qin, nicknamed "Pockmarked Yongxing"). He was arrested by Chinese Detective Huang Fusen of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the First Special District Court, which sentenced him to life imprisonment. Yang appealed the verdict to the Second Branch of the Higher Court, which, after hearing the case, overturned the original verdict and reduced the sentence to seven years of imprisonment. He was immediately sent to prison to serve his sentence. However, Yang contracted an illness in prison, and the prison doctor's treatment was ineffective. He died on the 17th of this month. The prosecutor of the First Special District Court confirmed that the death was genuine and ordered his sons, Jizong and Shaozong, to claim the body and provide a coffin.

### An Auxiliary to the Five-Year Plan: The Soviet Rationing System

— Peng Yipeng

Allocation to Promote Production, Thoroughly Implementing Class Struggle Characteristics

During World War I, the Tsarist Russian government, recognizing the severity of material panic within the country, also emulated the German method and implemented a special item rationing system. However, the issuance of such rations did not correspond to the actual supply of goods. As a result, the abnormal condition of non-fulfillment often occurred, and the public's trust in the rations was completely lost.

Following the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet government rose to power. On the one hand, it declared the nationalization of land, financial institutions, large industries, ships, etc.; on the other hand, it abandoned the rules of monetary economics, implemented the compulsory requisition of means of production, and the imposition of labor, using rationing to manage a unified distribution system. All Soviet people received the same allotment, regardless of diligence or laziness. Because of the equality of treatment for both the diligent and the lazy, a general state of idleness was created, which led to phenomena such as insufficient material supply and rampant black market transactions, until the implementation of the New Economic Policy. As it was gradually overcome and the unprecedented undertaking of the Industrial Five-Year Plan began, the economic situation within the Soviet Union greatly improved. The fact that it can now compete with Germany is the result of the past efforts of the Soviet government and people.

The Soviet Union's past efforts have gone through countless hardships; such as the initial domestic war, the siege of the great powers, domestic material panic, soaring prices, and the flooding of paper money, etc. The fact that the daily consumer life of the Soviet people could survive so many difficulties cannot but be attributed to the Soviet government's production increase policies and rationing policies. Now that the world is in turmoil and consumption controls are prevalent, and everyone is paying attention to the implementation of the rationing system, it seems not meaningless to review the Soviet Union's past rationing system.

The use of the rationing system is based on a background of insufficient materials, and it is not easy to increase their supply in a short period of time. Therefore, we must make appropriate distribution based on what we have in order to seek equality of enjoyment, and to prevent the monopoly and improper waste of a few people. To seek the maintenance of the lives of the entire society; only by maintaining the lives of the entire society can we overcome the fundamental abnormal condition of insufficient material supply through increased production.

During the first Five-Year Plan era in the Soviet Union, the countermeasure to the insufficient supply of materials was to adopt a rationing system. And from the distribution of rations, the role of encouraging increased production was injected. At that time, according to the so-called "principle of class nature and impulsiveness", the allocation and allocation prices of food, clothing, etc. were distributed differently depending on the amount of labor value provided to the society. As a result, the general clergy who made no contribution to social production and the general propertied class who sat idle were not allowed to enjoy rations. Because the distribution of rations was given according to the provision of labor, it was called a labor voucher. There were two types of these rations. The first type was divided into A and B forms. Form A was given to factory workers, and Form B was given to general laborers. The second type was distributed to those with non-wage income; as for merchants, brokers, and those without civil rights, they were not given it. As for factories, government offices, armies, schools, clubs, etc., special distribution agencies were set up to carry out special distribution methods.

Under this method, merchants, wealthy peasants, monks, and other people who did not receive rations had to purchase materials at high prices. Therefore, at that time, the domestic commodity market in the Soviet Union was divided into three types of prices. The first type was the standard price market using rations. The other two types were the profit price market using currency to purchase and the market price market. The so-called profit price market was used when state-owned commodity operations traded commodities; the so-called market price was the price at which individual stores operated commodity sales. The Soviet government believed that those who did not work and eat without rations should pay the most expensive price to obtain their living conditions; if they provided their labor to the society, they could obtain low-cost items with rations. This different treatment did originate from their class concept, but it also deeply implies the great significance of rewarding labor and encouraging production.

However, since there are three different prices with disparate values ​​in the market, the illegal use of rations is inevitable. In order to prevent the misuse of rations, the Soviet government gradually increased its pricing in order to curb its malpractices. In addition, the financial inflation that was vigorously promoted at that time had a significant stimulus to market prices. However, due to the gradual success of the production increase policy, the supply of materials has greatly increased. Therefore, from 1935, the rationing system for bread and various commodities was abolished, and all were distributed according to profit prices. Before that, the Soviet government had gradually narrowed the difference between standard prices and profit prices. Therefore, the suspension of rations did not cause disturbances among the people.

This rationing system in the Soviet Union is significantly different from the rationing system implemented in Germany today. To put it briefly:

The Soviet Union decides commodity prices and distribution volumes based on class viewpoints, while Germany makes unequal regulations based on the physical condition of the people.

Soviet rations are all registered and limited to designated stores; both buyers and sellers are stipulated and cannot be separated. In addition to registered ones, Germany also has bearer ones, and bearer ones can be purchased from any store.

The Soviet Union permits the purchase of materials by means other than rations; Germany does not. For specific commodities using rations, no other transactions may be made other than ration transactions.

The Soviet Union allows the existence of black market transactions and black market prices, aiming to make the wealthy hand over their wealth to society. Germany strictly prohibits the black market.

Therefore, the Soviet ration can be called classism; the German rationing system can be called totalitarianism. The Soviet rationing system has an active production increase effect; the German rationing system is based on the supply of materials and implements passive equal distribution.

### The British Rationing System

— Yu Binran

The People and the King Receive the Same Treatment, Housewives Cooperate and Contribute the Most

On April 15th of this year, the British Minister of Food, Wilder, stated the difficulty of food supply in the next three months to warn his people. The effect is obviously to intensify the implementation of its food security policy, so it then compulsorily requisitioned all idle land to plant food crops, and those who violated the order were forced to buy it at a price of 25 pounds. It's not Britain's food problem, then

Regarding the consumption of foodstuffs, Britain has implemented a special permit system since October 8, 1939. The scope of implementation includes beef, canned food, cheese products, grains, etc. It also requisitioned margarine and wheat, etc., and at the same time used the average price one week before the start of the war as the price limit standard to prohibit over-the-counter transactions. At this point, the three main points of Britain's wartime consumption control policy have been demonstrated: 　Implementing a quantitative rationing system;　Implementing a requisition system when necessary as a backing for the public sales system;　Stopping price increases and implementing a price limit system

The important consumer goods that have already implemented a quantitative rationing system mainly include more than 20 types such as butter, bacon, sugar, meat, coffee, canned food, sausages, vegetables, milk, eggs, cooking oil, and black tea. At the beginning of last year, it was stipulated that each person could only eat 4 ounces of butter and bacon and 12 ounces of sugar per week, uniformly across the country. Even the king and all members of the royal family were subject to the same restrictions. Since the end of last year and the beginning of this year, the allocation of the following seven necessities has been reduced as needed; therefore, to this day, each person is limited to purchasing fresh meat for one shilling and two pence per week (previously, two shillings and six pence could be purchased), eight ounces of sugar, six ounces of butter and margarine in total, five ounces of bacon, and two ounces of cooking oil and jam each; the purchase volume for hotels and other industries is subject to separate regulations.

The role played by trade control and the management of imported product categories in the British necessities consumption control is also extremely important. Because Britain is an island nation, the supply of materials in the island nation, in addition to domestic production, mostly depends on overseas imports. In order to save transportation capacity, the import of non-essential goods should be prohibited and restricted in order to free up cargo ship tonnage to carry essential imports. For example, import permits were implemented for raw silk and silk fabrics in early October 1939; from November of the same year, it was extended to wool; in early 1940, it was extended to paper; in April of the same year, it was extended to cotton, rayon products, and linen products, etc. Looking back at the price-limited commodities announced in Shanghai today, the meaning of the so-called "necessities" is extremely bizarre. Not only is it not relevant to Chinese consumption, but it may not be entirely necessary for foreigners. On a day when the number of ship tonnage is extremely limited, whether the import of these "necessities" is "necessary" is worth considering when compared with the scope of the import permit system implemented in the UK itself.

Britain's wartime consumption control policy is supplemented by an active production increase policy, and it has achieved great success. For example, the self-sufficiency rate of potatoes has increased to 96%, the self-sufficiency rate of meat has also increased to 48%, and the self-sufficiency rate of wheat, wheat flour, fruits, sugar, and jam has increased to about 23%, which is a great improvement compared with before the war. In the past, there were many courtyards, idle land, hunting grounds, gardens, etc. in the UK itself, but now they are used as farmland for food crops under the government's compulsory cultivation and incentive development policies. The increase in the self-sufficiency rate of the above-mentioned food crops is the contribution of this policy.

In the implementation of Britain's wartime consumption control policy, the cooperation of housewives from all walks of life in Britain plays an especially important role. Because the daily material consumption life of the people is planned and managed by women. Housewives who can deeply understand the overall situation and assist the authorities in carrying out consumption saving and the distribution system will naturally achieve twice the result with half the effort.

—Colorfully printed—　—Distinguishing Men, Women, Old, and Young—

The rationing system is the main policy in today's wartime consumption control in Germany and was implemented at the same time as the start of the war.

Three weeks after the start of the war against Poland in 1939, citizens were required to obtain permits to purchase food. There were six types of permits, each in a different color: Bread ration (red); for bread and flour. Meat ration (light blue); for meat. Milk ration (green); for milk. Fat ration (yellow); for butter, cooking oil, etc. Sugar ration (white); for sugar. Food ration (rose); for oatmeal, rice, noodles, potatoes, eggs, coffee, seasonings, starch, sweets.

There are two types of these permits: one is like a public bond certificate with coupons attached. When purchasing goods, one cuts off a corner, like cutting off an interest coupon when receiving interest on a public bond. The other type is like the porridge or meal tickets issued by charitable organizations in Shanghai—one sheet is used once. The former type is used for bread, food, etc. The face of the ticket proves the user's name, address, and purchase quantity and has regional restrictions. It is invalid outside the designated area. The above is issued to individuals; hospitals, schools, etc., have group tickets. Users are divided into: Ordinary consumer purchase tickets; Heavy industry worker purchase tickets; Special industry worker purchase tickets; Tickets for children under six; Tickets for children under fourteen. Even general farmers and producers and sellers of the above items must first report their inventory and production estimates. Even when using their own products for personal use, they must use a fixed amount of consumption coupons. The products and inventory beyond the fixed amount must all be sold and cannot all be used to prevent the malpractice of hoarding.

The above is the form of allocation. As for the allocation amount, it is determined separately based on age, gender, and occupation, and it is gradually reduced over time. The amount stipulated in the second phase is

The amount each ordinary consumer can purchase per week: Meat (500 grams); Bread (240 grams); Fat (268.85 grams); Sugar (250 grams).

The amount each heavy industry worker can purchase per week: Meat (1,000 grams); Bread (3,800 grams); Fat (393.75 grams); Sugar (same as above).

The amount each special industry worker can purchase per week: Meat (1,200 grams); Bread (4,800 grams); Fat (740 grams); Sugar (same as above).

The coupon method for food consumption was already implemented during the last European war. This time, Germany is using the coupon method for clothes and hats in addition to food, which is unprecedented. For the year from November 1939, Germans were only allowed to use 100 clothing coupons. Different scores are stipulated for each type of clothing. For men, each suit of clothes is 60 points, a pair of socks is 6 points, and underwear is a uniform color, accounting for 27 to 35 points depending on the type. Therefore, each German man is only allowed to wear one suit of outerwear, one set of underwear, and one pair of socks per year, because these three types have already reached 100 points. As for women's clothing, it is more preferential. Presumably, the National Socialists also dislike old hags. Therefore, each set of women's clothing is 45 points, a pair of socks is 4 points, and they are allowed to wear six pairs a year; the first four pairs are 4 points each, and the last two pairs are 8 points each. In addition, bras are 4 points, gloves are 5 points, scarves are 5 points, handkerchiefs are 1 point, underwear is 10 points, skirts are 12 points, shirts are 15 points, etc. These have all been stipulated. These clothing coupons have different colors according to gender and age: Two- and three-year-olds are rose; Three- to fourteen-year-olds are green for boys and blue for girls; Those over fourteen are yellow for men and orange for women. Slightly revised from April of last year. The biggest change is that adults have increased from 100 points to 150 points, young children have increased from 70 points to 170 points, and babies have increased to 60 points. This is not the result of an increase in supply; it is because the past restrictions were too strict and had to be relaxed.

### Thinking of the Public Interest

— Wuwei

I am grateful that the authorities of the two concessions have taken decisive measures to implement the price control of daily necessities at retail. If this step could have been realized sooner, the exploitation suffered by the citizens from unscrupulous merchants raising prices could certainly have been less. However, having said that, there are always many twists and turns and obstacles in doing anything, not to mention controlling prices, from a few cents or fractions of a cent to dozens or hundreds of dollars' worth of things. It is quite a troublesome task to investigate them one by one and mark the reasonable price.

"There is a price but no goods." This is the first phenomenon after the price control is implemented. A friend wanted to buy a five-pound package of good XX malt extract milk powder. After inquiring at more than a dozen department stores and pharmacies in a row, they all refused, saying, "It's already sold out." In fact, according to insiders, although the source of this kind of goods is indeed lacking, it is not enough to meet the needs of retail. I heard that when this thing was the most expensive, it cost one hundred and twenty yuan to buy, but the current limited price is sixty-seven yuan. No wonder one has to "knock on nine doors and not one will open."

The result was not wrong. That friend finally asked an acquaintance to buy a bottle at the limited price of the Public Works Department. This kind of thing is not a necessity for ordinary people, but the elderly, the weak, children, and patients can't do without milk powder substitutes. I hope that the enlightened merchants who have the goods will not take profit too seriously for anything. As the Public Works Department said, everyone must think of the public interest, so that they can search their hearts in the quiet of night and not be ashamed.

### Another Ardent Hope for the Authorities: Suppressing High Rents Is Imminent

— Hao

The crimes of "house vermin" who exploit residents are extremely heinous, even more so than those of "commodity vermin." For several years, under the circumstance of "rare goods are available," they only knew how to constantly extort and exploit the subtenants. As for Mr. Li Zhen's accusation to the public that "rent should be calculated in US dollars," it is an extremely absurd thing that makes people furious. The subtenants, under the circumstance of "there is nowhere else to live," have nowhere to complain about their suffering and can only allow themselves to be exploited and live in pain. Since "commodity vermin" and "house vermin" are both thieves who exploit residents, now that "commodity vermin" have been ordered by the authorities to be sanctioned and have disappeared and dare not act recklessly, it is also necessary to impose the same sanctions on "house vermin." Therefore, I cannot help but petition the authorities of the two concessions on behalf of the vast majority of subtenants in the city to immediately issue an order to sanction "house vermin" in order to stabilize the lives of residents and complete the work.

I hope that the authorities of the two concessions will immediately order landlords and tenants to automatically reduce rents to a reasonable level. If there is an attempt to obtain undue profits, once it is found out or reported by tenants, the "house vermin" will be immediately arrested and severely punished according to law, or their lease rights will be cancelled, or even they will be deported.

It is stipulated that if landlords (major landlords) intend to increase rent to tenants (subtenants) in the future, they must apply to the competent authorities for approval and shall not increase it without authorization.

It is stipulated that if a tenant sublets the remaining house to a subtenant, the amount of rent that should be proportionally distributed should be based on the advantages and disadvantages of the room's location, according to the rent paid to the landlord and the amount of water, electricity, housing donations, and repair costs. However, the total amount of rent collected shall not exceed the total amount of the above-mentioned rent and reasonable profits. The room occupied by the tenant himself should have a certain limit; otherwise, if it occupies too much space, a corresponding amount should also be proportionally distributed when distributing the rent.

If a subtenant believes that the rent he is responsible for is too high, he can request a reasonable reduction from the subtenant in accordance with the Public Works Department's notice. If the subtenant refuses, he can report to the authorities for compulsory reduction or be punished according to law.

The interests of the subtenant that should be respected by the subtenant should also be respected, and unreasonable demands cannot be made.

Finally, I must state that there are also many subtenants who deeply understand the overall situation, and they are not included in what is mentioned in this article.

### Charitable Mahjong

— Zhigang

Shanghai people play mahjong, it's really common! It's hard to calculate the time and energy spent playing mahjong.

Recently, according to Western newspaper reports: the Scandinavian Women's Association organized by foreigners in Shanghai (a group organized by Scandinavian expatriate women in Shanghai) has begun to hold a kind of "charitable mahjong" entertainment. They invite members to play mahjong together in the club, and each winner donates the money they win to be used as charitable funds.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fourteen: Living the Life of a Hero

The first person, with his face to the side, ran for his life, his mind completely focused on the person behind him. He crashed right into Begonia; the second person didn't notice that there was an irrelevant bystander behind the person he was chasing. Seeing the person slow down, he immediately pounced on him and started fighting. No matter how quickly Begonia dodged, he still fell flat on his back.

This fall wouldn't have mattered at all under normal circumstances, but today, he was already exhausted from being on stage. At the same time, he was still coughing incessantly; when he fell, he felt a sharp pain in his waist and chest. It took him a good four or five minutes to get up.

The two culprits were still fighting on the sidewalk. Begonia could only look at them with a bitter face. Knowing that he couldn't withstand their punches, he could only walk away silently.

When he got home, Meibao had already prepared a relatively sumptuous dinner for him.

"Dad, you don't look well. You must be too tired today?" Seeing that he looked very tired, and his cough had gotten worse, and he had little appetite, Meibao became very anxious. (270)

### A Mother's Heart

— Yi

A mother's love is originally the purest and greatest thing in the world. A mother who loves her children with her whole heart and implements educational work can create many successful people through her motherly love and education.

In Fort Worth, Texas, USA, there is a Children's Home And Aid Society, which is purely a children's charity. This institution, famous throughout the United States, was founded by a great woman, Edna Gladney, and she continues her great and sacred work to this day.

To commemorate her great achievements, MGM Studios specially produced a technicolor film, *A Mother's Heart*, and dedicated it to this great woman.

This film, starring Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon, tells the story of Edna Gladney's wedding preparations before marriage and the happy family life enjoyed by Mr. Gladney after marriage. However, after her only son died in a car accident on a Christmas Day, she lived a lonely life. On a wedding anniversary night, a Dr. Mai brought a child to her home, hoping to take him in for the night. At first, she refused, but later she suddenly realized that raising children was a very valuable work, so she started a nursery at home.

She encountered the pain and obstruction of her husband's bankruptcy and death, and the non-cooperation of the municipal authorities, but she was not discouraged. She went to every state, every city, and every family in the United States to raise donations, and as a result, she created the Texas Children's Home And Aid Society, adopting children and choosing suitable parents for them, so that they could enjoy the happiness and rights that humans should enjoy.

She believes that every child who is born into this world becomes a member of humanity and should be treated the same as all human beings, and should not be discriminated against because they have no parents. She also believes that if the human beings in this world have better friendship and better understanding, then life will be more beautiful.

This is indeed an excellent and extremely meaningful film. The film itself has vivid stories, humorous interjections, moving performances, and beautiful colors, which can touch our hearts everywhere, making us understand that motherly love is indeed the most precious. Whether we think about it from the point of view of entertainment or the meaning of life, we are very worthy of appreciating this film, especially many mothers.

Because of the noble value of this film, the authorities of the Dihua Cinema specially donated all the proceeds from the first screening, excluding expenses, to three charitable organizations. The first is the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association, whose work is divided into three parts: newsboy schools, orphanages, and Huile Garden. The second is the Shanghai Children's Hospital, located at 51 Moliai Road. In the past year, more than 1,000 sick children have been hospitalized, and more than 10,000 have been treated as outpatients. The third is the Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital. From June 27th to May of this year, it has delivered 2,552 births, treated 21,371 outpatients, and the maternal mortality rate is 3 per thousand, with excellent results, no less than any women and children's hospital in the world. The economic sources of these three organizations are mostly from donations from enthusiastic people in the society.

Before the screening of *A Mother's Heart*, this journal specially introduces this film to readers in a warm manner, hoping that the society will have a deeper level of sympathy and cooperation for children's welfare work, and have greater interest and more active implementation in raising children.

My family problems

### Announcement of Essay Contest Winners: Eighth Installment - Country Wife

— Qi

I married a country girl as my wife according to the will of my parents and the words of the matchmaker. At that time, I was only seventeen, and she was one year younger than me.

She was not only illiterate, unable to recognize a single character, but also a believer of the feudal era. She admired superstition and yearned for wealth and status. When I returned to our small room, she would constantly chatter about the neighbors, saying whose husband had a high monthly salary and good fortune. Then there were things like we were out of firewood and rice. She simply had no words to comfort her husband after a hard day. If I had something to say, she would cry and weep for hours, making everyone aware of it, and attracting ignorant women from the front, upper, and rear buildings to come and watch the commotion. Also, beating the children was something she often did, sometimes to vent her anger, sometimes as a way of disciplining them. We have two children, one seven years old and the other eight. After returning home from school, if they didn't understand something in their homework, even if it was very simple, they had to wait for me to come back to solve it. I had to write things at night, which made me feel even more rushed and overwhelmed. As for her, she only knew how to tell stories, either superstitious ones or those about monsters. When a friend came to my house, if the friend was male, he would go back and mock me. If the friend was female, my wife would argue with me for several evenings. Whenever I went out for entertainment on Sundays, I had nothing to talk about with her. I liked to watch meaningful movies, but she always wanted to listen to Shanghai opera or Yue opera, stories of talented scholars and beautiful women, tragedies that induced tears. If I had business problems that I couldn't solve, I could only bear them in silence.

Her good points also existed: diligence, frugality, and hard work, and she didn't smoke or gamble. But how could I be satisfied with just these things? I need a woman with a respectable profession, who is the same age, has the same level of education, personality, and interests as me. So that we can both pursue independent lives and share the joys of life together. In our free time, we can study together and discuss current affairs.

Heavens! I now have such a female colleague. I have investigated everything about her situation and background. She is also diligent, frugal, and hardworking, with no bad habits, because I have known this from spending time with her every day at work, seeing her clothes and her ability to handle matters. She and I have a very good relationship, so I often think about divorcing that ignorant country woman, but I am often prevented by my own reason. I deeply regret why I married this kind of woman in the first place. I am only twenty-six years old now, and I believe that if things continue like this, it will not end well. I feel that this unsatisfactory family may one day break apart, ah! I'm afraid, I don't know what to do?

Editor's Note: Regarding Mr. Hong's family problem, I believe that Mr. Hong himself should bear part of the responsibility. A woman who has not received education often has inappropriate behavior, but this is not her own fault, but perhaps the negligence of her parents. Mr. Qi should show her sympathy and take on the responsibility of teaching her, so that she knows what is the proper way. You like to watch meaningful films, that's great. You can take her to see them a few times and patiently explain them to her, so that she develops an interest. She likes to watch local operas, you might as well go with her a few times. To make married life happy, you must not insist on your own views, but need mutual understanding and cooperation.

Please do not underestimate the virtues of diligence, frugality, and hard work. The fact that she does not smoke or gamble can be said to be very valuable. And the woman with a respectable profession that you hope to have as your wife may not actually give you a complete life. When both parents go out to work at the same time, no one will take care of the household chores, and who will take care of your two children?

To want to divorce your wife and consider your female colleague because of a lack of education is a dangerous idea. You cannot only care about your own happiness, you must also care about the happiness of your wife, the happiness of your children, and the happiness of your female colleague.

To be troubled by the dissatisfaction with the current environment is a very ordinary thing. Please remember that only those who can create a new family life and a new and beautiful environment are great men, heroes in the family.

This is the time to eat mutton again. Although mutton is a tonic for winter, many people don't like to eat it. Why? It's just that the muttony smell doesn't sit well with some people. In fact, there is a way to remove the muttony smell. Just boil the radish and mutton together first, and the smell will be removed. The best way to cook mutton is braised in soy sauce, with plenty of sugar. Adding winter bamboo shoots as an accompaniment is like icing on the cake. After it freezes, it can be sliced, and that's mutton jelly. It's excellent to have with wine. For those who like noodles, using braised mutton and mutton jelly as a topping is also very flavorful.
