Molotov's Declaration: Denouncing Germany for Violating Agreements

TASS, Moscow, 22nd - Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, issued a declaration today, the original text of which is as follows: "To the people of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government and its leader, Comrade Stalin, have authorized me to make the following statement: At 4:00 AM this morning, German troops, without making any demands or declaring war, suddenly attacked our country. Several points on our border were attacked, and the cities of Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Sevastopol, and Kaunas were bombed by German aircraft, resulting in more than 200 casualties. In addition, enemy aircraft and artillery have been bombarding our positions from Romania and Finland. This attack is an unprecedented act of perfidy. The Soviet Union and Germany have a non-aggression pact, and the Soviet government has strictly adhered to all the provisions of the treaty. During the period of its implementation, the German government has not been able to find any pretext for Soviet violations. However, the German side has disregarded everything and attacked our country. Therefore, the responsibility for this predatory attack rests entirely with the German fascist rulers. At 5:30 AM, after the German troops began their attack, the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, on behalf of the German government, sent a note to the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, stating that the German government had decided to wage war on the Soviet Union regarding the concentration of Red Army troops on the eastern border of Germany. In reply, I, on behalf of the Soviet government, stated that even at the last moment, the German government had not made any demands to the Soviet government. Although the Soviet Union maintained a peaceful stance, the German side still carried out the attack. Therefore, the German side is the aggressor. Under the instructions of the Soviet government, I must state that our air force and troops have never violated the border at any point. From this point of view, the Romanian radio report that Soviet aircraft bombed Romanian airfields is purely a lie and a provocation. Hitler made the same lies and provocations today. Hitler is attempting to falsely accuse the Soviet Union of violating the treaty, but these accusations come too late. Now that the Soviet Union has been attacked, the Soviet government has ordered its troops to repel this predatory attack and drive the German troops out of our territory. This war, which has been forced upon us, was not launched by the German people, workers, peasants, and intellectuals, whose suffering we deeply understand. In fact, the war was launched by the cruel German fascist rulers who have enslaved the peoples of France, Poland, Holland, Norway, Denmark, and others. The Soviet government is confident that our heroic Red Army, Navy, and Air Force will fulfill their glorious responsibility and inflict a devastating blow on the invaders. We have repelled the attacks of arrogant enemies more than once. When Napoleon invaded Russia, our people responded with "fighting for the motherland," and as a result, Napoleon suffered a crushing defeat and was destroyed. Hitler is now launching a so-called new crusade war against our country and will suffer the same fate. For the motherland, for glory, for freedom, our Red Army and people will once again achieve victory. The Soviet government is confident that the entire nation, workers, peasants, and intellectuals will fulfill their respective duties. At present, our people must implement unprecedented solidarity. In order to support the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force and to guarantee victory against the enemy, every person must demonstrate the discipline and self-sacrifice of a true Soviet patriot. People of the Soviet Union, the government now asks you to further support our glorious Bolshevik Party, the Soviet government, and our great leader, Stalin. We are fighting for justice, the enemy will be defeated, and victory will be ours."

Editorial

### The Outbreak of the German-Soviet War

The German-Soviet war has finally broken out, opening a new page in world history!

The confrontation between the Soviet Union and Germany, two countries that have always been on opposite sides, was something that people had considered inevitable for years. However, after the rise of appeasement policies, the Soviet Union, in order to avoid encirclement by capitalist countries, and Germany, in order to reduce the danger of fighting on two fronts, led to the failure of mutual assistance negotiations between the Soviet Union and the democratic countries, resulting in an unexpected rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany. The outbreak of the European war then became unavoidable. This war, which started in Northeast Europe, spread to Northern Europe, and had a significant impact in Western Europe, then expanded along the Danube River to the Balkans and the Mediterranean. After twenty-two months, it has now returned to its original starting point. This outcome was probably something that the parties who signed the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact never anticipated.

First of all, it should be pointed out that while there are indeed various contradictions between the Soviet Union and the Nazis, from ideology to political systems, this war is also a result of complex and intertwined international interests and should not be viewed as a struggle between two ideologies or two political systems, just as the previous rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany could not be viewed as a reconciliation between communism and Nazism. Therefore, this war should be observed specifically from the actual situation.

The fact that the Nazi summer offensive did not break out in the English Channel or the Atlantic but unexpectedly revisited the eastward advance in "Mein Kampf" not only shows the uncertainty of attacking Britain but also reflects Hitler's foresight. From the perspective of German-Soviet relations since the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact, the only thing that existed between the two sides was armed peace amid mutual suspicion, not genuine mutual assistance and mutual protection. The fact that the Soviet Union abandoned its consistently advocated principle of collective security and turned to the mutual guarantees of the Nazis to seek its own security was partly due to Chamberlain's appeasement policy but also shows that the Soviet side attached great importance to the danger of being attacked by the Nazis. In Hitler's mind, the grain of Ukraine and the oil of Azerbaijan were essential elements for establishing the Nazi "new order," and the prolonged indecision of the war against Britain made his covetousness increasingly eager to the point of impatience. At the same time, the Soviet Union's intensified strengthening of its defense in the Baltic Sea and its blatant concern for the Danube River basin and the Balkans were seen by the Nazis as a thorn in their side. Germany may not have been unaware of the hidden dangers based on Poland's experience in fighting Germany, and the delay in launching an attack on Britain, apart from the lack of sufficient strength, was probably also a major concern. With the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, the sharp situation between the Soviet Union and Germany became increasingly apparent. Yesterday's incident was at least being considered and arranged for actual implementation in the office on Wilhelmstrasse at that time. After the end of the battles in the Balkans and Crete, the German side did not intend to continue advancing eastward. The appeals of the former authorities in Iraq could be ignored, and the war in Syria was even viewed as a bystander, which shows that attention was focused elsewhere. Whether it was the issue of resources, the Middle East issue, or whether it was to consolidate the occupied areas of Europe or continue the war against Britain, a general solution could be obtained from the war against the Soviet Union. If victory could be achieved in one battle, the current difficulties could be easily resolved. What Hitler is currently engaged in is probably such a wishful calculation.

According to yesterday's news, in addition to gathering a large force, the German side also used Finland's and Romania's territorial disputes with the Soviet Union as an aid, launching a full-scale offensive against the Soviet Union from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. Molotov's declaration at 9:00 AM yesterday (6:00 PM Shanghai time) also clearly accepted the German challenge. This battle, which is larger in scale than the Western Front campaign last summer, has already unfolded along the entire western border of the Soviet Union. Comparing the strength of the two armies, they are slightly equal in terms of quantity, while the Soviet side has more reserves. In terms of quality, comparing the previous combat performance of the two armies in attacking the Mannerheim Line and the Maginot Line, there is a difference in combat effectiveness. However, the history and quality of the Red Army, even after many changes, still cannot be underestimated. For example, the paratrooper tactics that the Nazis have repeatedly used and made effective were invented by the Soviet Union. After the end of the Soviet-Finnish War last spring, the Soviet side made major changes to its military personnel, starting with Voroshilov, and actively engaged in training based on the experiences of the Soviet-Finnish War and the Western Front campaign, and abolished the system of political commissars to concentrate the responsibilities of officers at all levels. The effect of this will be answered in this battle. From a purely military point of view, if no special changes occur, Hitler's usual blitzkrieg offensive may not be able to maintain its past combat record. This is not only because the Soviet Union is unusually vast, and the German army will encounter the same difficulties as Japan's invasion of China, but also because the Soviet side has long been prepared to arrange the heart of its economic industry and defense in a safe area far from the western border. Therefore, if the Nazi goal is only Ukraine and Baku, then due to geographical location, it may be able to succeed, but the Slavic nation, which is good at using scorched-earth tactics, may not be willing to let the enemy easily obtain these priceless treasures. If Hitler intends to coerce the Soviet Union with military force and then accept his so-called new order or wants to fundamentally defeat the Soviet Union, then the outcome is uncertain. Judging from common sense, once this war breaks out, its resolution will not be decided in an instant. As for whether Hitler is risking the danger of fighting on two fronts because he already has special confidence, it is not yet possible to determine at this moment.

The occurrence of this event is naturally a major key to the international situation, and any reactions will be reserved. One point that can be clarified is that during the previous brewing period, both sides actively plotted in the diplomatic field. In addition to the already seen German-Soviet-Japanese pact, Hess's trip to Britain and Cripps's return home were also important episodes in the meantime. The success of these has the same significant impact on the future of both sides as military strength. If the democratic countries and the Soviet Union abandon their resentments because of the common war against the Nazis, and the collective security movement, which had already been disillusioned two years ago, is revived, then the chaotic current situation may gradually reveal light, although this joint operation must still go through an arduous process. If they still regard each other as strangers and watch the success or failure of the war, then it is naturally what Hitler would like to hear, and the Nazi power after that will be as powerful as the sun in the sky and irresistible!

German-Soviet War Stuns Japan

United Press, Tokyo, 22nd - Officials here were shocked by the news of Germany's declaration of war on the Soviet Union but declined to elaborate on what impact this situation would have on Japan. Foreign Minister Matsuoka received a report from Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima that Germany had attacked the Soviet Union and immediately reported this news and other issues to the Emperor. According to the Domei News Agency, a joint meeting of the government and the General Headquarters may be held tomorrow morning. This meeting is apparently to study the question of Japan's position. Observers believe that Japan's position is quite complicated due to the existence of the German-Japanese Tripartite Pact and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, and it seems that it will adopt a wait-and-see policy for the time being. Some observers believe that Japan may distance itself from Germany because of the Soviet-Japanese Treaty, especially the recent declaration of Soviet-Japanese friendship. Other observers believe that Japan may try to adjust its relations with the United States. Some people believe that this situation is another influence on Japan and will wait for the opportunity to negotiate with the Dutch East Indies again.

Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd - After the German-Soviet declaration of war, the Japanese government decided to convene an emergency liaison meeting between the government and the High Command at 9:00 AM tomorrow. Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima informed the Japanese government of this development after noon. Hours later, Foreign Minister Matsuoka entered the Imperial Palace to report to the Emperor. It seems unlikely that any official reaction will be available before tomorrow morning's liaison meeting. According to Japanese semi-official sources, a diplomatic source said that the German-Soviet war not only created an extremely complex international situation but also triggered a conflict between capitalism and socialism around the world in addition to the European war. It is expected that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union may form an alliance. The promotion of this war was due to the Soviet Union's obstruction of the supply of Bessarabia to Germany and the Soviet Union's attitude towards the German offensive in the Balkans.

Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd - Urgent telegrams from New York and Berlin regarding the German-Soviet war have been published by newspapers and have caused general surprise because until the last minute, the public had not heard of rumors that the two countries were about to go to war. Official criticism of the German-Soviet war is not yet available, but it is heard that government officials are currently discussing the matter.

Romanian Leader's Proclamation to the Soldiers: The Time Has Come to Recover Lost Territory

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 22nd - Romanian Leader Antonescu issued a book to the soldiers this morning, saying, "I now issue an order, and the soldiers will sweep away the enemy troops in the northeast and liberate the enslaved compatriots, so as not to be chained by the Bolsheviks. Restore the old Bessarabia and Bukovina forests and lands of our country."

Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 22nd - Romanian Broadcasting reported that the Romanian navy, army, and air force began general mobilization at midnight.

Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 22nd - Romanian leader Antonescu is now commanding the war on the Soviet-Romanian border and has appointed his brother Mihai as the Minister of State.

United Press, Stockholm, 22nd - It was learned here yesterday that the borders of Sweden and Finland are now almost completely closed, and border patrols have also been strengthened. Traffic between Sweden and Denmark has virtually been cut off.

Finland as a Nazi Tool: The United States Regrets

International News Service, Washington, 22nd - Officials here regard the German declaration of war on the Soviet Union as not surprising but regret the alliance between Finland and Germany, as Finland has been regarded as a friend of the United States. Democratic Senator George said, "The surrender of the Soviet Union seems unlikely, so the war between Germany and the Soviet Union can give England a few months to breathe. During this period, England can use the assistance of the United States to recuperate, and the United States can calmly implement the national defense program. This incident will never shake the position of the United States, only showing that Germany and the Soviet Union are not trustworthy." Representative Fish said, "The European situation is now more complicated, and the United States has a stronger reason to stay out of it."

United Press, Helsinki, 22nd - Although Helsinki was congested last night due to the sudden increase in military vehicle traffic, it was very calm. Railway traffic here is not out of the ordinary but cannot be compared with January 1939. The Finnish government's call for reservists to enlist has caused the work of building air-raid shelters on the ground in Helsinki to come to a standstill. The doors of air-raid shelters in northern Finland, which had been closed for more than a year, have now been reopened.

Sweden Decides to Maintain Neutrality: Closes Border Traffic

Havas, Switzerland, 22nd - According to a correspondent for the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" stationed in Stockholm, the current situation in Finland will not affect Sweden, but if war breaks out in Finland, the situation will be different. Fortunately, the Swedish people have reached a consensus and will be able to continue to maintain a neutral policy. The necessary preparations have been completed here during the past week. The Swedish Parliament is scheduled to hold a secret meeting next Friday, but it is believed that there will be no changes in its foreign policy.

Reuters, Stockholm, 22nd - The Swedish Cabinet convened an emergency meeting this morning. The King returned to the palace from his country villa at 10:15 AM and received Foreign Minister Gunther and Prime Minister Hansson fifteen minutes later, dispersing at 11:20 AM. Swedish Radio issued instructions to ships sailing at sea, stating that in view of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, they must immediately return to Swedish ports.

### Key Points of the German Note to the Soviet Union

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd - The key points of the German Foreign Ministry's note to the Soviet government are as follows: (1) It details how the German government attempted to set aside the different concepts of National Socialism and Communism, which advocated opposing views, and decided to seek a way to maintain a balance of interests. (2) The Soviet government's willingness to conclude a friendship treaty with Germany clearly proves that the Soviet government sympathizes with the German government, that is to say, the Soviet government should be able to understand the German government's intentions and not spread communism in Germany. (3) After signing the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the German government's policy towards the Soviet Union underwent a fundamental change and completely adopted a friendly attitude, hoping that the Soviet Union would adopt the same policy towards Germany. How could one have known that human hearts are unpredictable and things go against one's wishes? (4) Finally, the German government presented various pieces of evidence to clarify the Soviet Union's conspiracy against Germany, especially in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and other countries. The Communist Party had distributed various anti-German leaflets, and the evidence was irrefutable and could not be concealed.

### German Foreign Minister Receives Envoys from Various Countries

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st - This morning, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop received the ambassadors of Italy, Japan, Turkey, and Spain, as well as the envoys of Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland, Romania, Sweden, Slovakia, and Croatia, totaling eleven countries. These eleven countries are either allies of Germany or have close diplomatic ties with Germany. Therefore, after the German government decided on measures to be taken against the Soviet Union, it immediately notified the resident envoys of these countries.

### Turkey Convenes Emergency Cabinet Meeting

International News Agency, New York, 22nd - The National Broadcasting Company stated yesterday that, according to a Rome wireless report, Turkish President İsmet İnönü convened an important cabinet meeting in Istanbul on Sunday.

United Press, London, 22nd - It was learned here yesterday from a broadcast from Ankara that the Turkish parliament has approved the extension of military alert on its western border for three months.

### Chinese People Determined to Strive, All of America Extends Sympathy - US Ambassador Gauss's Interview with Reporters

Chongqing - When the newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Gauss, met with Chinese news reporters, he remained strictly silent regarding the recent developments in the international situation. When asked about US-Japan relations, he stated that the future developments are difficult to predict, but the attitude of the United States can be clearly understood through its actions. Gauss greatly praised the Chinese people for maintaining a cheerful spirit despite suffering various wartime hardships. He continued by saying that the US government and people, in light of the resolute and tireless efforts of the Chinese people, naturally extend their sympathy. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

### Chairman Chiang's Instructions at the National Financial Conference - Establishing a Financial and Economic Foundation, Implementing Grain and Land Policies

The full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions at the Financial Conference is as follows: Today, the second National Financial Conference and Pacification Conference are holding their opening ceremony. The Chairman's instructions just now explained the significance and importance of the conference's tasks, which everyone must thoroughly understand. Today, I will add a few more points to what the Chairman said and offer them to my fellow comrades. Originally, the nature of the Pacification Conference and the Financial Conference have many things in common, that is, to coordinate the military and political aspects of the rear to jointly consolidate the foundation of resistance and national construction. Therefore, my opinions on several fundamental issues at the National Financial Conference should also be carefully listened to by all comrades attending the Pacification Conference, so that we can help each other practically and proceed in a unified manner. Since the establishment of the National Government, two National Financial Conferences have been held. The first conference was to abolish likin throughout the country, and the second conference was to abolish various exorbitant taxes and levies in various places. The implementation of these two major events eliminated the heavy obstacles to the national economy and allowed people's livelihood to develop freely. They were all major reforms related to the country. However, the achievements of these two conferences were still of a passive nature, focusing on the aspect of (eliminating malpractices). Today, the second National Financial Conference that we are holding is the same as the past two conferences in its task, but it is entirely about carrying out

### Active Construction

work. It is to build a sound national finance during the resistance and construction period, and to establish a permanent foundation for national finance. In other words, it is necessary to comprehensively plan and rationally allocate national finance, so that the construction undertakings of various provinces, especially economic construction, will not have the phenomenon of uneven distribution of wealth and poverty, but will be able to develop universally and balancedly. In order to achieve this goal, the government must first determine two goals: (1) To balance national financial revenue and expenditure, (2) To equalize the burden on the people. These two points are the basic policies of modern government resistance and construction, so everyone must recognize that this financial conference is by no means comparable to an ordinary conference. Its task is not only to implement the transfer of land tax to the central government and establish a financial revenue and expenditure system. Although these two matters are the main plans of this conference, in terms of the entire spirit and fundamental nature that the conference wants to implement, this conference is really the most important conference related to the national economy and people's livelihood and the future of national construction. When we think back to the hardships and difficulties that the national government has gone through in finance since its establishment, how much we have known, and now that the resistance and construction have been going on for four years, not only is there no dangerous phenomenon in national finance, both internally and externally, but it is becoming sounder and more stable day by day. From this, on the one hand, we can see the greatness of the latent power of our national economy, and on the other hand, it is enough to show the soundness and correctness of the policies implemented by our government, and the difficulty and preciousness of the achievements obtained through past hard struggles. Everyone must know that we are now engaged in a protracted resistance and construction, and the reason why finance can still be maintained to such an extent is due to the success of the legal tender policy. What is this legal tender policy? Today, it may as well be stated clearly that it is the

### Monetary Revolution

the success of. When I inspected various provinces and entered Sichuan in the 24th year of the Republic of China, I saw the complexity of the currency system in various places, which was really frightening. Therefore, I studied the pain of the people and the darkness of society. The crux of all kinds of malpractices lies in this. Furthermore, I thought that if the country were to have a war with foreign countries, the financial economy would be even more chaotic and would directly control the country's lifeline. Therefore, if our country wants to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and be able to cope with all internal and external difficulties, the only important task is to unify the currency system in finance and economy, so that legal tender can circulate smoothly throughout the country, so that the people will not suffer the pain of exploitation in the past, and the wartime will not be affected by the chaos of finance and finance. Therefore, when I arrived in Sichuan at that time, in addition to the implementation of the fire prevention zone system in Sichuan, I also decided that the central government must implement the policy of unifying the national currency system. This policy of unifying the currency system is something that everyone has considered very difficult and impossible to achieve for decades, and it is also something that any financier in the past dared not do. Our financial authorities seem to be able to follow the government's policy and the principle of the Prime Minister's currency revolution, not avoiding complaints, and working hard despite all kinds of difficulties. Later, they were able to completely complete it. Therefore, our resistance and construction can achieve such results today. When our legal tender policy was first implemented, the financial and financial circles in the country and various commercial banks at that time believed that the unification of the currency system would cause a great loss to their interests. Before it started, there were many discussions expressing complete opposition, and many rumors and slanders occurred, which almost caused the national market to shake. After the government issued an order and thoroughly implemented it, not only did the financial circles and various banks and money houses not suffer any losses, but all their businesses suddenly advanced, and commerce was exceptionally developed. All public and private economic undertakings could

### Thrive

If we compare the situation before and after the unification of the currency system, the development of all economic industries in our country after the implementation of the currency system has really felt like a thousand miles a day. This is a very obvious fact in recent years. We are now approaching the glorious victory of resistance and construction, which has already been decided. It is also approaching the time when we have to overcome and break through all the final difficulties. We must think back to all the dangers and difficulties we have experienced in the past, as well as the unification of China's currency system in the 24th year of the Republic of China, which could not be unified for hundreds of years, and the bad habits that could not be broken in the past, so that legal tender could be implemented without hindrance, and finance could be developed as much as possible. The most difficult and chaotic big problem was completely solved. What financial problems cannot be solved in the future? However, this is entirely the progress of the times, and the progress of the knowledge and thinking of our people across the country, as well as the ability of the financial and industrial circles across the country to understand the big picture, understand the righteousness, and unanimously support the government's policies, not hesitating to sacrifice the interests of the small self, and to contribute to the country, so that we can get such an effect of today's resistance and construction. From the experience of unifying the currency system, we can get a definition, that is, "Everything that is beneficial to the country and the people must also be beneficial to the individual." Therefore, the government must seek to implement any policy that is beneficial to the country and the people to the end, no matter what difficulties it encounters, and there is no reason why this policy will not succeed. We must now establish a financial foundation for national construction, and we must transfer the national land tax to the central government for management. The national financial revenue and expenditure system and the local autonomous financial revenue and expenditure system must also be clearly divided. Only then can the country become a modern country. The former land tax will be explained later. For the latter financial revenue and expenditure system, if it can be established separately, on the one hand, the expenses of local autonomous undertakings can be guaranteed, and the new county system can be completed as scheduled, so that it will not be like the past in name only. On the other hand, after the national financial revenue and expenditure system is established, not only the central finance

### Will Be Solid From Now On

Moreover, all construction undertakings in various provinces, especially national defense and economic undertakings, can also be effectively promoted, and there will never be any unhealthy and deformed situations like in the past, so that the remote and sparsely populated areas have no construction power for important national defense undertakings, which is equivalent to a desert. Therefore, these two things are the basic important tasks of the entire national economy and people's livelihood at present, not only related to finance. Whether it is the comrades attending this financial conference and economic conference, as well as the central and local responsible officials, we must recognize that this is not only a problem related to the national financial economy, but also a problem related to the survival of our farmers, workers, merchants, students, and people from all walks of life. Therefore, everyone must work together to implement today's financial policies to the end. Only in this way can the resistance and construction war be won, and the country can be built. Originally, the war and the construction of the country were one and the same thing. Because we want to build the country, we must fight, and the war is precisely for the sake of building the country. Therefore, at the beginning of the war, the foundation for building the country had already been laid, and during the war, we must work hard to build the country. During this period, because we want to establish the foundation for building the country, we have proposed three concrete policies and tried our best to ensure that they are implemented. The first is to implement the new system and promote local autonomy. If the new county system can be implemented effectively in accordance with the prescribed plan and goals, and local autonomy can be effective, the national politics will have a solid foundation, and all national construction work can be completely successful. The second is financial revenue and expenditure.

### Should Seek Balance

The burden on the people must be equal. The former requires the government to be able to abide by the resolution and the budget to implement the principle of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, which is not difficult to do. As for the latter, it is actually the most important. During this period of resistance and construction, we must not allow the rich people not to pay, but instead allow the poor masses to bear the expenses of the country. This is the most unfair thing. In the future, we must effectively correct it to seek the average burden of the people. However, if we want to average the national burden, we must first rectify the national taxation. To rectify the national taxation, the central government must formulate an entire plan and implement it in a unified manner in order to achieve this goal. The third is to implement the Prime Minister's land and food policies. Originally, in the Prime Minister's will, regarding the construction of national finance and economic undertakings, the most important tasks during the revolutionary period were three: (1) To implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, we must implement the "Monetary Revolution," which is to unify the currency system. (2) We must strictly implement "food management" at all times, whether in peacetime or wartime, and set up a special food administration. If the country cannot manage food, then the people's food and military food will have no foundation. In this way, the country can never become a modern country.

### Allied Forces Surround on Three Sides, Damascus Finally Falls - British Forces in the North Advance Towards Palmyra - Syrian War May End Soon

United Press, 12th - It was announced here late yesterday evening that Allied forces have entered Damascus.

Havase News Agency, Beirut, 21st - An official communique was recently released stating: (1) Our army has been pressured by enemy forces. In order to avoid war on the outskirts of the city, it has withdrawn from the city of Damascus to new positions outside the city to continue fighting today. (2) Enemy motorized units that have invaded the Syrian state from Iraq are now advancing towards the city of Palmyra.

Reuters, Jerusalem, 22nd - According to news from Beirut, the Vichy forces under the command of General Dentz have retreated to new positions north of Damascus.

Havase News Agency, Vichy, 21st - Regarding the French army's withdrawal from the city of Damascus, no detailed report has been received here. It is heard that the French General Staff was originally worried that the defenders' retreat route would be cut off and the city might be completely surrounded. Since the British army repeatedly failed to attack Damascus, it adopted a new strategy, implementing an encirclement offensive on the east, west, and south sides, and infiltrating a small number of troops into the city. However, as enemy reinforcements continued to arrive, the situation became increasingly dangerous, and the British artillery outside the city resumed shelling the city, causing severe damage to the Mohajreen New District in the west of the city. Under these circumstances, the defenders in the city had to move to new positions outside the city to continue the protest in order to avoid widespread death and destruction.

Reuters, Floriano, 22nd - Free French leader General Tegol met with a Reuters reporter last night, saying that the fall of Damascus will definitely bring the Vichy army's resistance in Syria to a swift end. General Tegol placed a large map of Syria in front of him, saying that the Free French entered Damascus at 3:00 AM, and although the British army has not yet entered the city, the victory of the French relies heavily on the help of the British army.

Reuters, Cairo, 22nd - The news from Beirut that the central army has taken Damascus has now been confirmed by the official venue. According to reports from scouts and confessions from prisoners of war, Syrian Affairs Officer General Dentz has used all of his forces for the rear of the battlefield and has no reserves. As a result, the Syrian war is expected to end soon.

Reuters, Cairo, 22nd - A British Air Force communique for the Middle East stated yesterday that on Friday, British troops destroyed many armored tanks on the road from Damascus to Beirut, and ships in the port of Beirut were also bombed by naval aviation. Four large wharves there were hit, and one ship suspected of being a submarine was also hit.

Famous Mosque Bombed - Arabs Angrily Protest to Britain

Haitong News Agency, Beirut, 22nd - Regarding the damage caused by the British army's shelling of Damascus, eyewitnesses said that it was even worse than the damage suffered in 1925. Half of the Umayyad Mosque has been destroyed, and a fire has broken out in the historically valuable part of the city. The number of civilian deaths has already reached 500 and is still increasing.

Haitong News Agency, Beirut, 22nd - According to news received here last night, the Syrian protest against the British artillery shelling of Damascus, especially the mosque, has been forwarded to British Ambassador to Iraq Cornwallis by the Iraqi government.

Haitong News Agency, Beirut, 22nd - After receiving news here of the British army's bombing of Damascus and the destruction of the world-famous Umayyad Mosque, the Arab delegation immediately visited the British High Commissioner to protest. The Arab people gathered in front of the commissioner's office to demonstrate, and British and Jewish military police suppressed them everywhere.

Haitong News Agency, Beirut, 22nd - All mosques in the Egyptian capital read out protests against the British army's shelling of Damascus and the Umayyad Church on Friday. Students from Al-Azhar University marched and demonstrated at the British Embassy to protest the shelling, and no accidents occurred.

### Britain Issues Ultimatum to French East Africa - Demanding to Join the Free French Forces - Otherwise, an Imminent Blockade Will Be Implemented - Negotiations on Using Railways Have Reached a Stalemate

Reuters, London, 22nd - According to Vichy Radio, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, has issued a letter of ultimatum to French Somaliland, and France has protested to Britain and notified the United States. British pressure on French Somaliland continues to increase, and this letter of ultimatum has finally been issued. Negotiations on the British use of the railway from Addis Ababa to Djibouti have reached a stalemate because General Wavell's conditions are unacceptable to the French. The above-mentioned letter of ultimatum has not yet been confirmed in London.

Lubei News Agency, London, 22nd - It is now learned that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, has asked the governors of Djibouti and French Somaliland to state their position and immediately join the Free French Forces or publicly announce that they do not approve of the pro-German policies of Syria. If they do not negotiate on this proposal, General Wavell is willing to allow women and children to withdraw from Djibouti and is willing to provide milk and necessary food until the evacuation of women and children is completed. Djibouti is a seaport with a railway connecting it to Addis Ababa, the capital of the 9,000-square-mile French colony at the mouth of the Red Sea, with a population of 15,000 before the war. According to Vichy news, General Wavell issued a letter of ultimatum demanding that French Somaliland join the Free French Forces, otherwise the French colony will be in danger of famine due to the implementation of a strict blockade. The Vichy government has ordered French Ambassador to Spain Walter to deliver a protest to British Ambassador to Spain Hall.

Content of France's Protest to Britain

Havase News Agency, Vichy, 21st - French Ambassador to Spain Pittry visited British Ambassador Sir Hall today and personally delivered a note from the French government, protesting against Britain's threat to starve the people of French Somaliland in East Africa. The French government also instructed Ambassador to the United States Hai Henry to deliver the same note to the US government, urging it to pay attention. The full text of the note is translated as follows: (1) General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Near East Forces, on June 9, 1941, notified the French authorities in writing on behalf of the British government that if French Somaliland does not return to the Tegol faction, Britain will intensify its blockade and starve all the residents of the area. On the contrary, if it can be accepted with pleasure, Britain will take various steps to transport food to maintain the people's food and guarantee its economic interests. This document is almost equivalent to an ultimatum. (2) This kind of ultimatum is equivalent to sentencing all the residents in a certain territory to death by starvation in order to force them to rebel against their motherland. There is almost no precedent for this kind of means in human history. However, the people of French Somaliland have expressed to the military and political authorities their decision to be loyal to the Petain government. All kinds of rumors from the outside world are not true. French Somaliland has been surrounded by British troops and the Tegol faction for two months. Only five of the more than 2,000 French expatriates have crossed the border to join the Tegol faction. (3) The British authorities have been implementing blockade measures against French Somaliland since September 1940, and have been quite effective. For example, in March and April of this year, several children starved to death due to lack of food. The people of French Somaliland, in dire straits, only rose up to resist this inhumane measure, and once issued an earnest appeal to the British government and the International Red Cross representative in Somaliland. (4) The French government has allowed other countries to transport food through the French port of Djibouti under the auspices of the International Red Cross to Abyssinia to relieve the general sick and injured adults and children. This attitude is not biased towards any of the belligerent countries, but rather the French in this painful period still want to express their inherent humanitarianism and selfless spirit. This is in stark contrast to the attitude of the United Kingdom.

### Major Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over the English Channel, 28 German Planes Shot Down, American-Made Tomahawk Planes Achieve Remarkable Results

Reuters, London, 22nd: According to the communiqué, the British Air Force fiercely attacked the German Air Force in northern France during the day yesterday, destroying 28 of their fighters, while only four British planes were lost. The British are now using new-style Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft, which rise faster, fly higher, and have greater firepower than older models. Yesterday was the fifth consecutive day of attacks on northern France during the day. The attacks were carried out in two waves, and the scale of power and the intensity of the attacks were unprecedented since the British Air Force adopted an offensive stance. Both waves of British aircraft broke through the German fighter formations and severely bombed the German-occupied airfields. In the first wave, at least eleven enemy aircraft were destroyed in the morning. Three hours later, the second wave of the British Air Force moved out and destroyed even more enemy aircraft, resulting in a battle result of destroying 28 enemy aircraft in one day. This is the greatest harvest since the British air war last autumn. As a result, the German aircraft lost a total of 65 aircraft in the past five days.

Haidisha, Berlin, 22nd: According to the official statement, British aircraft attempted to invade the German-occupied area yesterday, losing a total of 26 aircraft, 24 of which were shot down by German aircraft, and two were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Five German planes are missing.

Reuters, London, 22nd: This morning, the Ministry of Aviation issued a communiqué stating that a large number of British bombers continued to bomb Germany's heavy industrial areas last night. The main targets were Cologne and Dusseldorf. The docks of Dunkirk and Boulogne were also bombed by British aircraft.

Reuters, London, 22nd: Last night, the intelligence department of the Ministry of Aviation reported that the American-made single-seat Tomahawk fighter aircraft are unique in their lift-off and striking power, and have achieved remarkable results in the recent fierce air battles in the Middle East. It is now known that British Empire pilots have used this type of aircraft to defend the British fleet outside Syria to prevent German dive bombers from attacking, and to resist German and Italian aircraft attacking in the Near East. The Ministry of Aviation added a comment saying that since this latest type of fighter aircraft has gradually appeared in increasing numbers, it has shot down many of the best German and Italian aircraft. This not only shows that the material assistance provided by the United States to Britain and the Allies continues to develop, but also shows that Britain's sky power in the Middle East is increasing day by day. All those who fly this aircraft praise its ease of use and its ability to safely defeat German and Italian aircraft.

### US Secretary of the Army Announces the Formation of Army Air Corps, Appoints a Commander to Command Independently, The Department of the Army Also Asks Congress to Approve Extending the Enlistment Period of the National Defense Force by One Year

United Press, Washington, 22nd: Secretary of the Army Colonel Stimson announced yesterday that he had ordered the reorganization of the activities of the United States Army Air Corps into an independent agency called the "Army Air Corps." This agency will combine the general headquarters into one under the name of "Army Air Corps" and will be commanded independently by an officer. This new air force command will only be controlled by the Chief of Staff. It is reported that Major General Arnold may be the commander of this new agency. Colonel Stimson strongly opposed merging the air forces of the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps to form an absolutely independent Air Force Department. He said, "With this change, whether it is assisting ground troops in combat or establishing a long-range and powerful force such as special task forces, it will have the effect of creating unified command and can assist naval, land, and air operations."

Reuters, Washington, 22nd: Secretary of the Army Stimson announced that a unified organization called the Army Air Corps has now been established. All training, supplies, and other matters will be under the control of a senior air force officer who will be responsible only to the Army Chief of Staff.

Reuters, Washington, 22nd: The US Department of the Army has submitted a request to President Roosevelt to ask Congress to approve the extension of the enlistment period of the National Guard to one year beyond the existing one year. When the Department of the Army announced this matter, it said that legislation must be enacted to extend the enlistment period of the National Guard. As for the final decision, it is a matter of public policy that should be handled by the President and Congress. If Congress does not agree, the first batch of 290,000 people in the current National Guard will be demobilized on September 16.

### Full Text of Hitler's Declaration

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: German Führer Hitler's declaration of war on the Soviet Union was read by Propaganda Minister Goebbels at 3:30 this morning. The content roughly stated that the Soviet Union had been betraying the treaty of friendship signed with Germany, and the Soviet Union had been in contact with Britain to promote policies against Germany and the whole of Europe for more than a year. The Soviet Union is now gathering a large army of 160 divisions on Germany's eastern border. In order to prevent this military action, Germany is forced to decide to form an alliance with Finland and Romania, placing the future destiny of Germany and its people in the hands of our soldiers. The full text of the Führer's declaration is as follows:

German people, National Socialist comrades, I have carefully maintained silence for several months. At this moment, I can speak frankly. When Germany received Britain's declaration of war on September 23, 1939, Britain repeatedly attempted to obstruct the unity of Europe and waged war against the strongest country on the European continent. In the summer of 1939, Britain began to use its old tricks from the World War, attempting to destroy Germany through an encirclement policy, creating various lies, claiming that various nations had been threatened, and providing promises of assistance and guarantees to induce them to fight against Germany. The situation was the same as during the World War. From May to August 1939, Britain continuously broadcast promises to the world, stating that Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Bessarabia, Ukraine, etc. had all been directly threatened by Germany. Some of these countries were deceived and accepted Britain's guarantee promises, joining the front line of encircling Germany. Under this situation, I shouldered the heavy responsibility of the history of the German nation, using facts to protect the countries deceived by the British lies, and first stabilize the position of the eastern border, limited to the scope of our interests. The German people have never harbored hostility towards the Soviet people. However, the Jewish Bolshevik rulers in Moscow have for more than 20 years always regarded inciting the flames of war in Germany and even the whole of Europe as their mission. Germany has never attempted to import National Socialism into the Soviet Union. However, the Bolshevik rulers in Moscow have always wanted to control Germany and other European nations by political means and force. The result of this activity of the Soviet Union only plunged various countries into chaos and famine. On the contrary, in the recent 20 years, I have strived to create a new social order for Germany through productive work. The purpose of this national economic and social policy is to create a true people's society and eliminate class differences. In August 1939, in extremely difficult circumstances, I sent the Foreign Minister to Moscow, striving to counter Britain's policy of encircling Germany. At that time, Germany solemnly assured Moscow that the proposed territories and countries, except for Lithuania, were all outside the scope of Germany's political interests, and signed a special agreement with it on the condition that Britain incited Poland to fight against Germany. The content of this agreement was quite harsh on the Germans in the countries concerned. As many as 500,000 German men and women were forced to leave their homes and return to their country overnight. However, thousands of Germans mysteriously disappeared, and their whereabouts were unknown. Among them, 160 were citizens of Germany. I had to keep silent about all of this at the time, and hoped that I could finally alleviate this tension. However, when our army entered Poland, the Soviet rulers suddenly violated the treaty and made a demand for Lithuania. Germany never intended to occupy Lithuania, nor did it make this request to the Lithuanian government. On the contrary, Germany refused the application of the then government of Lithuania for German troops to enter Lithuania. Even so, I still agreed to the new request of the Soviet Union. After the victory in the Polish campaign, I made peace proposals to the Western countries, but they were ultimately unsuccessful due to international conspiracies and the refusal of Jewish war agitators. At that time, Britain held out the hope of mobilizing a European alliance to deal with Germany, including the Balkans and the Soviet Union. The British government later decided to send Cripps as ambassador to the Soviet Union, going to Moscow to fulfill the instruction to promote British-Soviet relations and make the Soviet Union produce pro-British tendencies. The effect gradually became apparent in the autumn of 1939 and the spring of 1940. The Soviet Union forcibly conquered Finland and the Baltic countries, its motives were hypocritical and ridiculous, but I still maintained silence. However, the figures in the Kremlin went a step further. In the spring of 1940, Germany complied with the provisions of the so-called treaty of friendship and withdrew the German army from the eastern border. At that time, the Soviet Union had begun to concentrate its troops. This measure can be regarded as a deliberate threat to Germany. According to Molotov, in the spring of 1940, there were 22 Soviet divisions in the Baltic countries. Although the Soviet government concealed its meaning, its role in demonstrating against Germany was self-evident. After the German army defeated the resistance of Britain and France on the western front on May 10, 1940, the Soviet army continued to expand its operations on the eastern front. After August 1940, I considered that the eastern border could no longer be left empty and undefended. Later, the Soviet Foreign Commissar for Foreign Affairs asked Germany the following four questions:

(1) Molotov asked, if the Soviet Union attacks Romania, will Germany's guarantee to Romania also be directed against the Soviet Union? I replied that Germany's guarantee to Romania is of a general nature and we will abide by it unconditionally. The Soviet Union has declared to us that the Soviet Union has no other interests in Romania except for Bessarabia, so the occupation of Northern Bukovina has already violated this guarantee. Therefore, I believe that the Soviet Union cannot have any other intentions towards Romania.

(2) Molotov asked, the Soviet Union still feels threatened by Finland, so it has decided that it can no longer tolerate it. Does Germany have no intention of helping Finland? Will it withdraw its troops passing through Kirkenes? I replied that Germany still has absolutely no political interests in Finland. However, the German government believes that it cannot tolerate the Soviet Union's launching an attack on the small nation of Finland. We can never believe that Finland can threaten the Soviet Union, nor do we want the Baltic Sea to cause a war.

(3) Molotov asked, can Germany agree to the Soviet Union providing guarantees to Bulgaria and sending Soviet troops to Bulgaria for protection? Molotov also made it clear that he had no intention of abolishing the Bulgarian King. I replied that Bulgaria is an autonomous country. I don't know if Bulgaria has ever asked the Soviet Union to provide guarantees, like Romania to Germany, but I am willing to discuss this matter with my allies.

(4) Molotov asked, the Soviet Union needs the convenience of free passage through the Dardanelles and requires the occupation of important bases in the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. Can Germany agree? I replied that Germany is willing to agree to amend the Mondreux Treaty at any time, with the premise of benefiting the Black Sea countries, but cannot agree to the Soviet Union occupying bases in the straits. My attitude on this is based on the position of a responsible leader of Germany and a representative of European culture. The result was to increase the Soviet Union's anti-German activities, immediately starting conspiracy activities against Romania and Bulgaria. A coup occurred in Romania, attempting to overthrow Antonescu's government. At that time, I still thought it was best to keep silence. However, after the Soviet Union's failure this time, it supplemented its concentrated troops on the border, threatening Germany. The Yugoslav campaign was evidence of British-Soviet cooperation. When I was striving to appease the Balkan countries and invited Yugoslavia to join the Tripartite Pact, Britain and the Soviet Union launched a coup in Yugoslavia overnight. The influence of the Soviet Union on this Serbian coup was greater than that of Britain. We still kept silent about it. The Soviet leaders went a step further. The German government has now obtained evidence of the Soviet Union inciting Serbia to fight against Germany. The Soviet Union had guaranteed to transport munitions, weapons, aircraft, etc. from Thessaloniki to Serbia. This happened when I was urging Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to ease tensions with the Soviet Union. After our army quickly occupied Thessaloniki, the Soviet-Anglo-Saxon conspiracy failed. At this point, Moscow had destroyed the German-Soviet treaty of friendship and revealed its contents. At this moment, I can no longer stand by and remain silent, becoming a sinner of the German people. The Soviet Union has gathered 160 divisions on Germany's eastern border, and violations of the border have occurred repeatedly. From the night of June 17 to the 18th, Soviet sentries were shelled from German territory, so it is necessary to take action to resist the Bolsheviks.

German people, our soldiers are now stationed with Finnish soldiers along the Arctic Ocean, protecting Finnish territory. From Prussia to the Black Sea, German troops are jointly defending with Romanian troops. This front line is not only protecting one country, but is protecting the security of the whole of Europe. Therefore, I have now decided to place the future destiny of Germany and its people in the hands of the soldiers. God bless me and help me fight. June 22, 1941, Hitler (signed)

### Great Contribution of the Chinese Transportation Industry: Successful Testing of Tung Oil Cars, Perfected After Several Studies and Transformations, Fuel Consumption of Only 24 Cents Per Kilometer, Transportation Industry Authority Comes to Shanghai to Talk About the Test Drive in Chongqing

The successful testing of domestically produced tung oil cars in the capital Chongqing on the 4th of this month has been reported in this newspaper. However, the transportation industry and machinery experts are quite concerned about the manufacturing process. Yesterday, an authority in the transportation industry returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, saying that when he was in Chongqing, he personally participated in the grand ceremony of the tung oil car test drive. It is said that Mr. Zhang Shigan, who participated in the Beijing-Yunnan Highway tour group with vegetable oil cars, is the chief engineer of the China Motor Manufacturing Company. Recently, he drove the tung oil car successfully manufactured by the company to Chongqing, invited people from all walks of life, and went to the capital to test the car. From Hualongqiao to Beipei Hot Springs, a distance of 60 kilometers, the round trip took one and a half hours. Tung oil was used entirely. When climbing Laoyingyan, the speed was 30 kilometers in third gear. In other places, it was 40 kilometers or more, which was no different from driving a gasoline car.

Burn Vegetable Oil to Drive Cars

The China Motor Manufacturing Company imitated the German Benz diesel engine and used vegetable oil to drive the car. When the company was founded in 1937, it began to study it, and fortunately it succeeded in more than a year. In the spring of 1938, the Executive Yuan held a Beijing-Yunnan Highway tour group, and the company sent a car to participate. From Shanghai to Kunming, and then from Kunming via Guizhou and Guangdong to Shanghai, it performed a total of 14,000 kilometers. The results were excellent. The car did not carry fuel with it, and completely used the vegetable oil produced locally by the construction bureaus of various provinces, such as cottonseed oil in Shanghai, peanut oil in Nanjing, rapeseed oil in Anhui Province, sesame oil and rapeseed oil in Jiangxi Province, vegetable oil and soybean oil in Hubei Province, tung oil and opium oil in Guizhou Province, and rapeseed oil in Yunnan Province.

Tung Oil Driving Laid the Foundation Early

When tung oil was first used in Guizhou Province, the results were exceptionally good, and the power was very great, ranking first among all oils. However, because the car was driven for a little longer, obstacles occurred inside the machine, and it often stopped for repairs on the way. The tung oil was very viscous, the oil quality easily changed, the oil surface formed a skin, and the oil pipe was blocked, causing the components to not move freely. However, although the results were not satisfactory, the fact that tung oil can drive cars was indeed laid its foundation at that time.

Research and Improvement Repeatedly Failed

Mr. Zeng Yangfu, the chairman of the company, believed that tung oil driving was the only way to fuel oil during wartime. Since he had already found a clue, he should obtain its results. So he encouraged Zhang to conduct further research, and added many assistant chemical experts to assist in the test. At first, they started from the chemical aspect, using chemical drugs and materials to prevent oxidation, and infiltrating other thin oils into the tung oil, in order to prevent it from drying out and correct its viscosity. However, the result was too much carbon, and the cylinder was easily damaged, so it failed. Then, they reformed from the physical aspect, adding external heat to the tung oil tank to reduce its viscosity, and switching to diesel oil when parking the car to prevent the oil pipe from forming a skin. However, this method increased the number of parts, the procedures were complicated, and management was difficult, which was definitely not something that ordinary drivers could handle, so it was not considered successful.

Final Decision: Fundamental Transformation

The final decision was to fundamentally transform the manufacturing work based on the performance of tung oil itself. The heat unit contained in tung oil and diesel oil was compared with each other to determine the volume of the pre-combustion chamber, so that it fully conformed to the application of tung oil. This was to enable tung oil to fully gasify in the pre-combustion chamber, to be completely burned in the cylinder, leaving no carbon residue, so the cylinder was extremely clean, and obstacles were not easy to occur in the parts. The pressure during tung oil injection was also increased to resist the thick viscosity of tung oil, so that tung oil could be completely turned into a thin mist when sprayed out, so that it could be in close contact with high-pressure air and fully gasify in the pre-combustion chamber, and the injection time was advanced to correct the shortcomings of the slow combustion of tung oil.

All Obstacles Removed, Test Successful

The ventilation points of each roadway were more tightly sealed, so that air could not come into contact with the tung oil, the oil surface could not change, and the oil pipe would not be blocked and obstacles would occur. Alcohol was used to start the car when it was cold, and there was no difficulty in starting. According to the above improvement methods, the company has conducted strict long-term tests on several new cars it manufactured, and the results are extremely satisfactory. The experiment of using domestically produced tung oil to replace imported gasoline and diesel oil to drive cars has been completely successful so far.

From Guiyang to Chongqing in 15 Hours

The engine of the car driven by Zhang to the capital this time was manufactured by the company itself based on the test results, so it is extremely suitable for using tung oil. The car departed from the company's Guilin branch to Chongqing, covering a distance of 1,200 kilometers, carrying 2.5 tons of goods, and using tung oil entirely. In terms of the machine, no obstacles occurred at all. The speed per hour was as high as 55 kilometers, and the average speed was 35 kilometers. It only took 15 hours from Guiyang to Haitangxi. Climbing mountains and crossing ridges was slightly slower than gasoline cars, but the ability was quite good, and all the slopes could be traveled smoothly, which was completely the same as when using diesel oil.

24 Kilometers Cost 6 Yuan

Tung oil is 15 gallons per catty. The market price in Guilin is 86 yuan per dan, and the price per gallon is 6 yuan. It can travel 24 kilometers per gallon on flat ground, so the fuel cost per kilometer is only 24 cents. This was determined during the Guiyang-Chongqing trip, and the average consumption was 18.3 kilometers per gallon. All tung oil was purchased from oil shops in the city and was not refined. The refined oil evaporates and loses its power, the horsepower is reduced, and the amount used is more, so the results are not good. The purchased oil is filtered with native cloth before it can be added to the car's oil tank for use. The filtering method is the same as that used by tofu shops to filter soybean juice.

Daqu Maotai is Burned to Start

When starting a cold car, use a little alcohol. Daqu Maotai can also be used. To clean the parts, use boiling water, and the oil stains will be removed immediately. To store tung oil, use bamboo baskets. Therefore, the fuel used by the company's demonstration car this time and its treatment method are all the most commonly used old methods in our country, which can be called completely domestic products.

### Lugouqiao Battle Fourth Anniversary: All Circles are Preparing for Commemoration, Strict Precautions on Both Boundary Sides

The fourth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7th is approaching. Various circles in this city, due to the special circumstances, will not hold any commemorative ceremonies. However, they have already planned and are actively preparing for commemorative measures for this great historical day. According to a reporter from the Daguang News Agency, the police authorities of the two concession areas in this city, considering the current tense situation and the important position of Shanghai, will implement emergency precautions ahead of time to maintain the security of the concessions and ensure public peace. The preventive measures will be stricter than in the past to prevent accidents. It is said that any gatherings or parades will be prohibited for a week before and after the anniversary to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble.

### Japanese Soldiers in Shengze Area Frequently Attacked

According to a person from Wujiang, the Shengze area in Wujiang County, located between the Sujia Road and Taihu Lake, is a strategic location. Usually, twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers are stationed there. However, the Loyal Patriotic Army scattered in the area frequently launches attacks, causing the Japanese soldiers to be in a state of panic. One week ago, late at night, a unit of the Loyal Patriotic Army took advantage of the Japanese soldiers' unpreparedness and stormed into the town with lightning speed. The Japanese soldiers were caught off guard and suffered heavy losses. When the Japanese soldiers in Wujiang County City heard the news, they urgently dispatched a large force. However, the Chinese army had already withdrawn safely.

### Shanghai's Trade Surplus in May Exceeds 100 Million Yuan, Transportation Still Maintains Original Status, and Essential Supplies are Sufficient

Since the expansion of the European war, transportation has become difficult, and the trade of all countries in the world has been affected. This city is one of the largest international cities, and the Pacific sea route can still maintain its original status. Therefore, this city's trade with foreign countries has not only not been adversely affected but has instead become increasingly prosperous. According to the Jianghai Customs, Shanghai's foreign trade in May had an import value of 26,098,944 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to 70,649,841 legal tender yuan, and an export value of 197,688,592 yuan. The resulting trade surplus amounted to 127,038,751 yuan, a record rarely seen in the city's history.

Food Still Occupies the Top Spot in Imports

Among the goods imported in May, food still occupied the top spot, with a total value of 8,998,640 Customs Gold Units, an increase compared to the previous month. Among them, foreign rice accounted for the largest share, with a total import of 555,971 metric tons in May, valued at 4,876,980 Customs Gold Units. Imports from Burma accounted for five-tenths, or 240,722 metric tons. Next was Annam with 217,721 metric tons, followed by Thailand with 89,982 metric tons. From January to May, Shanghai's import of foreign rice has reached 3,611,892 metric tons, indicating that there is absolutely no shortage of food for the city's residents.

Cotton and Oils Arrive in Shanghai in Large Quantities

Cotton ranked second in import volume, as Shanghai has always been a textile center. Its import value was 5,662,411 Customs Gold Units. Imports from India accounted for one-half of the total, and the quantity of American cotton was also considerable. Oil imports ranked third, with a value of 1,581,854 Customs Gold Units. The Dutch East Indies accounted for slightly less than one-half of the source, followed by the United States and other places. Gasoline alone reached 6,868,473 liters, equivalent to 223,649 Customs Gold Units. Diesel imports reached 8,460 tons, equivalent to 319,762 Customs Gold Units. It is evident that the city's fuel situation has not yet deteriorated.

Sugar Trade Suddenly Leaps Forward

Sugar, which used to have a small share in import volume, has now jumped to fourth place, with a total value of 1,158,067 Customs Gold Units. Six-tenths of it came from the Dutch East Indies. It is reported that the sudden increase in quantity is due to merchants fearing disputes in the South Pacific and placing large orders. Paper ranked fifth, with a value of 967,174 Customs Gold Units. Imports from the United States accounted for two-thirds, followed by Taiwan and other places. In addition to the above categories, goods with larger imports include chemicals and metals.

Metals are Transported Inland for Construction

As for export goods, textiles used to be the most numerous. However, in May, metal products jumped to the top, with a value of 29,063,189 yuan. Among them, iron accounted for the largest share. The largest export destination was the Guangdong leased territory (Kowloon), with a value of 10,398,908 yuan. It is said that it was transferred to free China for construction purposes. The next destinations were India, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, which is believed to be for military use. Textiles (including silk fabrics) ranked second in exports, with a value of 28,966,547 yuan. More than one-half was exported to the United States, followed by Japan and India.

Shanghai Cotton Fabrics Sell Well Abroad

Cotton fabrics ranked third in export value, with a value of 15,346,372 yuan. The Dutch East Indies was the largest export destination, followed by the United States, Hong Kong, and India. Textile products ranked fourth, with a value of 18,691,766 yuan. They were mostly exported to Hong Kong, India, and Annam. Animal products ranked fifth, with a value of 14,584,392 yuan. Three-quarters were exported to the United States, followed by Japan. In addition to the above categories, goods with larger exports included groceries and grains.

### Japanese Strictly Check Household Registration in Hongkou, Increase Number of Military Police Posts

Since Japanese people in Hongkou and the areas beyond the boundaries of the road have been assassinated one after another, the Japanese side's investigation of residents in the area has become more stringent than before. According to a reporter from Pinghu News Agency, in the past week, two Japanese military police officers have been conducting door-to-door investigations of households in the Hongkou district, filling in the household's population, name, occupation, and other items on the forms they carry. At the same time, the number of Japanese military police posts in the Hongkou district has also increased, with each post increasing from one person to three or four people. The area around the Waibaidu Bridge is particularly noticeable. It is also learned that the Hongkou Citizens' Union also distributed household registration survey forms a week ago through the district's Baozhang and Jiazhang, ordering them to be filled out and guaranteed by each household. It is said that each household will have to pay a security fee of one yuan per month to cover the union's operating expenses.

### Twelve American Ships to Take Over the Far East Route, Voyage Kept Secret, Ships to Sail According to Schedule to Carry Passengers and Cargo, Schedule Could Be Arranged Within a Week

After the American Maritime Commission requisitioned seven President liners belonging to the American President Lines as auxiliary naval vessels, the authorities of the President Lines in this area, in order to ensure the safety of maritime travel and prevent all possible accidents, will keep the voyage of the company's ships and the names of the ships sailing to America secret. Previously scheduled voyages have been canceled. This measure not only emulates the cautious steps taken by the Allied countries during the war but is also a necessary measure given the tense relations between the United States and Germany and Italy. Subsequent replenishment of new ship schedules has not been determined, so it is necessary to reschedule.

Adam's Round-the-World Voyage Cancelled

The company in this area has received a telegram from its headquarters stating that the twelve President liners dispatched to the Far East will sail to Shanghai according to schedule to carry cargo and passengers to replace the shortage caused by the requisition of seven ships. The itinerary of the President Adam's liner, which was originally scheduled to sail from the United States on July 24 for a round-the-world voyage to Shanghai, has also been canceled. The itinerary of the President Pierce liner will also be changed and has not yet been determined. However, as the ship is listed on the micro-name list, it may be necessary to keep it secret.

Twelve American Ships Regularly Sail to Shanghai

Of the twelve President liners newly dispatched to the Far East, the remaining ships, except for the President Van Buren liner and the President Polk liner, which are still docked at the shipyard and have not yet been completed, will be sailed here as soon as possible. Among them, the President Garfield and President Monroe liners are sister ships to the President Van Buren, President Polk, and President Jackson liners. Each has a load of 16,000 tons and was recently recommended for construction by the Maritime Commission. The remaining four President liners, the President Buchanan, President Johnson, President Taylor, and President Fillmore, are cargo ships. The other four President liners, the President Madison, President Grant, President Harrison, and President Taylor, are said to have originally belonged to the former Dollar Steamship Lines and have been idle for a long time. The company is now extensively repairing the old ships at the San Francisco shipyard to allow them to sail to the Far East as soon as possible and maintain the route.

Revised Schedule to be Announced Within a Week

It is learned that the company authorities have done their best to expedite the scheduling of the twelve ships in order to meet the needs of shipping. Although the company has not made a decisive decision on the ship's sailing date and route, the company authorities will announce it within a week. The company will also do its best to purchase and utilize the cargo space of military transports in order to supply merchants.

### Polish Representative Broadcasts: Continue the Struggle, Democratic Countries Must Cooperate Closely

The League of Democratic Nations, initiated by Mr. Alexander, the head of the British Embassy Information Office in this city, makes broadcast speeches every Friday evening on XMHA radio. Last week's speaker was the Polish representative, who stated in brief: Germany disregarded the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and invaded Poland. The Soviet Union then followed suit and invaded our country's eastern border. We tried our best to resist, but due to the disparity in military strength, our country fell into the hands of the enemy. However, the people of our country, united from top to bottom, have not engaged in any acts of treason from beginning to end, which is truly a cause for self-consolation. At present, the Polish people are under the "new order," with tens of thousands of people being deprived of their property and their lives being destroyed. Those who have no home to return to are too numerous to count. Anyone who disobeys Nazi orders is killed or imprisoned. The so-called freedom and culture have long disappeared from Poland. Most countries in Europe are now under the iron heel of the Nazis. Hitler's former claims of peace, merely aimed at abolishing the Treaty of Versailles, have now been torn to shreds, and he is realizing his ambition to rule Europe. We must remember this. The democratic nations are now fighting for national freedom and respect for the democratic principles of individuals. We must cooperate closely to realize this belief. Poland and the Czech Republic have already completed the first step. After this, whether during wartime or after peace is achieved, we must advance and retreat together with the democratic countries. Our homeland has two: one is our own country, and the other is Great Britain. How should all the people of Poland intensify their struggle and efforts for their homeland?

### Crime Rate Decreased Last Week

According to the Shanghai Municipal Police, the number of crimes committed has been declining month by month in recent months. Last week, a total of 326 criminal cases occurred in the Public Concession, a decrease of four cases compared to the previous week. 455 criminals were arrested, a decrease of eleven compared to the previous week. The security within the concession has been strengthened by the addition of the White Russian reserve team of the police force and the assistance of the American defense forces stationed in Shanghai.

### The Rainy Season Has Arrived, Desperate to Get Rid of Stock, Rice Market Rumors are Alarmist, Current Situation is Unrelated to Rice Transport, Market Price is Difficult to Manipulate Due to Government Rice Intervention

Since the general large-scale hoarders fabricated various rumors at the end of last week in an attempt to raise rice prices but failed, they are now spreading alarmist rumors, saying that the Shanghai Municipal Council has encountered difficulties in ordering foreign rice from Hong Kong, in an attempt to confuse market sentiment. Their intentions are truly hateful. Yesterday, the reporter paid a special visit to a certain gentleman close to the authorities and asked for his opinion. According to him:

Hoarders Constantly Think of Sabotage

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council began selling foreign rice on a widespread basis in this city, the general large-scale hoarders have constantly thought of sabotaging it. However, in order to thoroughly solve the city's food problem, the authorities are determined to overcome difficulties and resolutely implement it. Not only has it gained the support of the entire city's population, but all legitimate rice merchants have also cooperated sincerely with it, so that the city's rice prices can be suppressed. Recently, the market price has been difficult to fluctuate sharply, but the difference from the selling price of the Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice is limited, making it impossible for the general hoarders to hoard and manipulate prices, and they also feel it difficult to sell. The millions of bags of foreign rice they have hoarded in warehouses are prone to spoilage due to the arrival of the rainy season.

Attempt to Induce Blind Obedience

Based on the above situation, the general hoarders have no other way to think of than to create various alarmist rumors in the market in an attempt to induce the general blindly following people to buy in large quantities. As for the 280,000 bags of Hong Kong rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the first phase, in addition to the 220,000 bags that have arrived one after another, the remaining 60,000 bags will definitely arrive in Shanghai within the month. The various grain stores have also already begun to order Hong Kong rice from the authorities in the second phase, and the quantity has reached more than 6,000 tons (that is, more than 60,000 bags). There is no limit to the quantity ordered, and the source will not be interrupted. Therefore, the rice market's situation is undoubtedly assured. Also, according to shipping circles, the Yong Sheng Wheel of the Japanese Heiwa Company arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon, carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice.

### Clerk of Salt Industry Bank Shot and Killed by Gatekeeper, Argument Led to Shooting, Lu Peiwen Died, Perpetrator Fled

Yesterday, a shooting occurred in the Beijing Road branch of the Salt Industry Bank, where a gatekeeper shot and killed the bank's deputy chief clerk. The perpetrator fled the scene afterward. Details of the incident are as follows:

Argument Leads to Shooting, Lu Shot Four Times

Lu Peiwen, 35, a native of Beiping and the deputy chief clerk of the Salt Industry Bank at 280 Beijing Road, had worked at the bank for many years. He was known for his diligence. He resided in the dormitory on the second floor of the bank. Yesterday, at 10:10 AM, Lu, being on a Sunday holiday, had nothing to do. He stepped out of the dormitory door and saw Meng Xianwu (26, a native of Beiping), the bank's gatekeeper, dressed in plain clothes. Because the gatekeeper was under his management, Lu went up to correct him, telling Meng that he should wear his uniform. Meng replied that it was Sunday and there was no need to wear the uniform, leading to an argument. The argument escalated. Unexpectedly, the young gatekeeper, in a fit of anger, disregarded the consequences and pulled out his service pistol, firing four shots at Lu. Lu was unable to defend himself against the sudden shooting and was hit in the chest, abdomen, and left temple. He immediately bled profusely and collapsed in a pool of blood. He barely had a breath left.

Dies in the Afternoon, Perpetrator Ardently Pursued

The perpetrator, Meng Xianwu, seeing that he had committed a major homicide, feared punishment and fled downstairs with his gun, disappearing without a trace. At the time, the people in the bank's dormitory had heard the gunshots and went out to investigate. Upon discovering the bloodshed, they reported it to the Central Police Station by telephone. A large group of detectives arrived and summoned an ambulance to take him to Tongren Hospital for medical treatment. However, Lu's injuries were critical and he had lost too much blood. He died at around 0:30 PM, and his body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. The police station immediately launched a rigorous pursuit of the perpetrator, Meng Xianwu, to arrest him and bring him to justice. It is said that Meng and Lu had some kind of discord in the past, with frequent arguments, leading to a long-standing animosity. This blood case has now occurred. It is also said that the bank authorities will provide generous funeral arrangements for Lu, as his family members are not in Shanghai.

### Resisting Arrest, Opening Fire, Bandit Sentenced

On the 5th of this month, at 7:15 PM, five bandits suddenly broke into the Yuan Da Coal Ball Company at 33 Alabaster Road, brandishing handguns and ordering the employees to remain silent. As they began to search for valuables, Hua Detective Huang Fusen and Detective Mu Liang Yuliang of the Shanghai Municipal Police rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. In desperation, the bandits only managed to grab two gold rings. They were unable to seize other valuables and fled out the door. They encountered the detectives and opened fire to resist arrest and escape. The detectives returned fire. As a result, two of the bandits, Xu and Cai, were hit in vital areas and died one after another. They abandoned a handgun with five bullets. The detectives apprehended two bandits from Haimen, Chen Yaowen and Wang Yixiang. They learned that an accomplice from Haimen, Ni Chunfa, was hiding in a room at the Asian Hotel on Hankou Road. They rushed to the address and arrested Ni, along with a woman named Jiang Mao囡. They were taken to the police station and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The trial judge, Zhong Qing, reviewed the case in court the other day. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, prosecuted them for the crime of gang robbery and stated that a leader named Wang Xilin was still at large and requested a thorough investigation. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive answers and asked for leniency. Judge Zhong sentenced Chen Yaowen, Wang Yixiang, and Ni Chunfa to five years in prison each. The handgun and bullets were confiscated, and one gold ring was returned to the owner.

### Stealing a Handgun, Committing a Crime, Arrested and Sentenced

Tang Yonggen, a local Shanghai resident who was an apprentice at the Yongkang Pawnshop at 255 Kaifeng Road, was dismissed by his master, Wang Haicheng, in April of last year due to his gambling addiction. He had been unemployed for more than a year. In March of this year, he went to Nanxiang to seek work from his friend, Chuan Zheng hai (who worked at the local police station). He stole a Mauser handgun with five bullets. He secretly returned to Shanghai and committed a robbery in the Hongkou district. On May 10, at 7:50 AM, Tang Yonggen, armed with a handgun and two handcuffs, broke into the Yongkang Pawnshop on Kaifeng Road. He brandished the handgun and threatened his former master, Wang Haicheng, and shop employee Wang Bingji. He handcuffed them and robbed them of 343 pieces of gold jewelry and 978 yuan in cash. He fled with the loot but was spotted and arrested by detectives. He was handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation. The trial judge, Huang, sentenced Tang Yonggen to five years in prison. The handgun and bullets were confiscated, and the stolen goods were returned to the owner.

### Gang Fight on Wenshi Road the Other Day, Caused by a Woman, Shoemaker Harassed a Woman Leading to Conflict, As a Result 25 Perpetrators Arrested

Yesterday, local newspapers in this city published a piece of news about a large-scale gang fight between hooligans from Beinan Road and Qipu Road and dalbing (large pancake) cooks. According to the reporter from Shewen News Agency, the truth of the matter is quite different from what was originally reported. Therefore, the details are as follows:

Harassment of Women Causes Strife

At 8:00 PM the night before (the 21st), at the Xinji Shoe Shop at 1 Changchun Lane, Wenshi Road, Public Concession, several shoemakers were cooling off at the alley entrance. At that time, a woman passed by. The shoemakers made fun of her. The woman left in anger. Unexpectedly, the woman was the sister-in-law of a gangster, nicknamed Auntie Yun. She was the mistress of Lu Chunlin, a famous hooligan known as Little Overlord in the Beinan Road area. Yun complained to Lu, who immediately went to negotiate. Unexpectedly, he was beaten by the shoemakers. Feeling humiliated, Lu gathered more than a hundred of his gang, each armed with iron rulers, iron rods, and nunchakus. They went to the scene with great fanfare to seek revenge.

A Chaotic Battle, Three Dead and Injured

The shoemakers at the shoe shop, knowing that they would definitely come back for revenge, also gathered more than one hundred shoemakers, holding sharp tools such as leather knives, and lined up on the road to wait. When the two sides met, a big fight broke out. For a time, shouts were heard. The nearby patrol officers were unable to stop it and immediately reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Police. Detective Feng Baishun and Deputy Detective Huang Fusen rushed to the scene to apprehend the perpetrators. The perpetrators fled in all directions. Twenty-five perpetrators were apprehended. It was discovered that Chen Xiaomao, a member of the gang, had a knife wound in the chest, and Wei Zhitong and Shi Lewen had back injuries. They were immediately sent to Baolong and Red Cross Hospitals for treatment. As a result, Chen died of his injuries. The police station will escort the apprehended criminals to the court this morning for questioning.

### Letter

To whom it may concern:

I, Lin Daofu, would like to state that upon reading the news article titled "Embezzlement of Watch Materials" in your newspaper on the 12th of this month, I was deeply shocked. The Yixin Watch Shop is a business that I solely own. I entrusted my younger brother, Daohua, to assist in management, and the business is doing quite well. However, my wife, Chen, is aggressive, tyrannical, and unreasonable. I have repeatedly warned her to no avail, and I feel like I am sitting on pins and needles. Over time, I became ill from worry. In order to avoid troubles and recuperate, I followed my doctor's advice and temporarily resided at 77 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road. Recently, as a bill was due, I instructed my younger brother, Daohua, to move some of the goods to the Riverside Building as collateral. This is my disposal of my own property, and my younger brother carried out my instructions. No one has the right to object. Unexpectedly, the shrew Chen dared to falsely report a robbery to the police and arbitrarily slander my younger brother, causing him great suffering. Fortunately, the First Special District Court showed its impartiality and released him in court. These are the facts of what happened. However, the report in your newspaper is completely inconsistent with the facts. I have specially commissioned your lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper demanding correction. Based on this, I am writing to you to request that you investigate and make a correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Su Junbo, June 21st.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather around Shandong and here is cloudy, clear, and hot. The wind is variable.

Educational News

### Primary and Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province Relocated to Shanghai to Resume Classes: Disbursement of Relief Funds According to Shanghai Standards

Jiangsu Province's relocated primary and secondary schools in Shanghai requested the Ministry of Education to allocate relief funds, which was approved. In May, 151,000 yuan in relief funds was allocated to the schools. The disbursement process is briefly described as follows:

(1) Telegram Requesting Equal Relief Due to Hardship: At the beginning of this semester, Shanghai schools, due to high prices and difficult living conditions, requested the Ministry of Education to allocate relief funds. The liaison office also needed to submit a report to the Ministry and Provincial Department, stating the difficult living conditions of colleagues in various schools, requesting equal relief as Shanghai schools. The Ministry, led by Lei You, adopted the suggestion and issued relief funds, along with a draft distribution plan. Schools in this province were to receive a total of 136,000 yuan.

(2) Negotiating Distribution Standards: Minister Lei requested the liaison office to negotiate distribution standards with educational authorities in Shanghai, which had been done several times. At the same time, it was heard that the Central Government had allocated an additional 600,000 yuan. To ensure that schools could receive more relief, the liaison office immediately sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education, requesting a portion of the 600,000 yuan to be allocated for relief to private schools in this province. Furthermore, the relief funds for colleges and above in Shanghai totaled 400,000 yuan, while the technical classes of the Jiangsu Industrial School and Sericulture School in this province were not included. The liaison office also telegraphed the Ministry to request assistance, sending four telegrams in succession, urging prompt approval. It was expected that the Ministry of Education, mindful of the difficult situation of the relocated schools in this province, might slightly increase the allocation. However, due to the urgency, schools, noting that relief funds for Shanghai schools had already been issued, began demanding their allocations. Fearing further delays and misunderstandings, the liaison office negotiated with educational authorities on May 12th to increase the allocation by 15,000 yuan, bringing the total to 151,000 yuan, including the previously allocated 136,000 yuan. This was distributed without waiting for the Ministry's instructions.

(3) Reporting Distribution Results to the Ministry and Provincial Department: The liaison office had already reported the distribution plan to the Ministry for instructions. As no reply had been received, the liaison office consulted with educational authorities and, based on the Shanghai standards for public and private schools, determined the proportional amounts. Ninety percent for provincial middle schools, forty-five percent for public middle schools and provincial primary schools, twenty-four percent for county private middle schools, and twelve percent for county private primary schools were allocated from the total of 151,000 yuan. The distribution results were as follows: (1) 170 classes in provincial middle schools (excluding vocational classes) received 660 yuan per class, totaling 112,489 yuan; (2) 34 classes in public middle schools and provincial primary schools received 330 yuan per class, totaling 11,249 yuan; county private middle schools were verified to have 136 classes (including science labs and other educational institutions), receiving 176 yuan per class, totaling 23,998 yuan; county private primary schools had 37 classes, receiving 88 yuan per class, totaling 3,264 yuan, totaling 151,000 yuan. The liaison office has now reported the distribution results to the Ministry and Provincial Department. In addition, the relief funds for the vocational classes of the Sericulture School and Jiangsu Industrial School already existed, but the disbursement procedures were still being finalized, so they were not issued at the same time. (4) Supplementary Explanation on the Completion of Distribution: The nature of this relief fund differed from the previous subsidy, which was intended for administrative support. Therefore, schools could allocate a portion for school administrative expenses, with the remainder distributed as salary subsidies to teachers and staff. In accordance with the Provincial Department's instructions, a portion was allocated for emergency reserve funds for Shanghai schools and scholarships for poor students. This relief fund was specifically designated for relieving the living expenses of teachers and staff, and neither the school authorities nor the administrative authorities could allocate it for other purposes. (2) Regarding the distribution standards, Shanghai's standards were higher, with 900 yuan per class for public middle schools and 140 yuan per class for private middle schools. Schools in this province resuming classes in Shanghai had more classes, so following Shanghai standards would not be sufficient. If the Shanghai standards were followed for provincial or private schools, the allocation for other schools would be further reduced. Moreover, this relief fund was a general allocation for all schools in Shanghai. It was not possible to adopt the previous standards for the subsidy and it was also inconvenient to establish new standards that differed from those of Shanghai schools. Therefore, the liaison office, with the consent of relevant authorities, followed the Shanghai standards proportionally. (Dahua News Agency)

### Prospects of the Shanghai Textile Industry

— Nie Guangzhong

After the Shanghai yarn market plummeted last summer, it only showed signs of recovery in October of last year due to the reopening of the Burma Road and the slightly smoother inland transportation. Since the beginning of spring, the general optimism has faded again, partly due to the Japanese military occupying the coast of western Guangdong and intensifying the coastal blockade; partly due to the disputes in Thailand and Vietnam, threatening the outbreak of war in the Far East at any time; and partly due to Japan intensifying its control over the markets in the occupied territories. In addition, the electricity supply in this city was reduced due to coal shortages. Since the end of February, some yarn factories have even implemented reduced working hours. Subsequently, due to the frequent blood-related cases in the city, the four major banks suspended operations for a time, and yarn prices soared with the rise in the exchange rate. As a result, manufacturers were happy again. However, before long, all kinds of unfavorable factors at the beginning of the year became more serious. The four major banks resumed operations, and the rumors subsided. In addition, with the establishment of the Sino-American and Sino-British exchange stabilization loans and the implementation of stabilization operations, the exchange rate loosened greatly, and the gold price collapsed. The yarn market then plummeted. Today, the gold price is falling sharply with small rebounds, and is in a state of decline. However, yarn prices have rebounded, and last weekend's situation became a surge, which is truly incredible.

### The Truth About the Exhaustion of Warehouse Receipts

Commodity transactions, even if speculative, are ultimately determined by actual supply and demand. The current sharp rise in the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn is said to be due to the tight supply of warehouse receipts and insufficient chips. This can also be regarded as the evolution of the law of supply and demand. However, the shortage of warehouse receipts is purely due to long positions buying up and closing out positions. Statistics show that the daily turnover of the yarn market is mostly inter-dealer transactions, and the amount sold to customers is negligible. As shown in the following table (in yuan):

The speculative nature of inter-dealer transactions is already well known. In fact, even the so-called customer transactions, in today's difficult transportation situation, are not without those who buy low and sell high. Customers, like securities firms and gold firms, are merely a label indicating the source, and are not necessarily all actual sales. Since they are not actual sales, inventories will not decrease. As for the purpose of long positions closing out warehouse receipts, it is nothing more than selling high. Therefore, the temporary shortage of chips today is the abundance of chips tomorrow. This goes without saying.

### Accumulation of Yarn Day by Day and Month by Month

The rice market is different from the yarn market. Rice is mainly consumed locally, and its supply area is in other cities. Therefore, hoarders have the possibility of local manipulation, but they are still no match for the impact of public sales of cheap rice. Yarn is the opposite. Its supply area is local, and its main consumption area is in other cities. Only when external freight is smooth, there will be a situation of demand exceeding supply, so that hoarders can be sure to make profits. Unfortunately, at this time and in this place, external sales are extremely unlikely. On the contrary, the rise in yarn prices has prompted manufacturers to increase production and sell futures. Therefore, yarn hoarders cannot insist on not selling like rice hoarders, because their most likely encounter is overproduction leading to oversupply.

According to Finance & Commerce, as of the end of February this year, there were 67 Chinese and foreign yarn factories in this city, with a total of more than 2.64 million spindles. Their maximum yarn production can reach 130,000 bales per month. After March, Japanese yarn factories reduced working hours by more than 50%, and British factories also reduced working hours by about 30%. Chinese merchants followed suit and reduced night shifts. However, at that time, the city's yarn production still reached more than 75,000 bales. Although there were further reductions in working hours by Chinese merchants due to electricity rationing, since the sharp rise in yarn prices in early May, those who had reduced production also resumed one after another. Therefore, the current yarn production is 90,000 to 100,000 bales per month.

Although supply is increasing, customer sales have not improved. Judging from the changes in yarn inventories in each month of this year, the most recent figures seem to have been affected by the reduction in working hours and are gradually decreasing. However, compared with the same period last year, there has been an increase in every month, and the increase has almost exceeded 50% to 60%. This shows the intensity of speculation in the current yarn market, and it also shows how serious its future dangers are.

The above yarn inventory figures are limited to those in warehouses. If we estimate the entire city, it should be more than 330,000 to 340,000 bales. In view of the difficulty of transportation, the sluggish actual sales, and the rising yarn prices stimulating yarn factories to increase production, the cotton yarn inventories are expected to continue to increase in the future.

### Cotton Inventories Increase with Time

In terms of actual sales channels, the cotton yarn in this city is still mainly sold to various parts of the Southwest and the occupied territories. Those exported to various parts of Southeast Asia account for only about 10%, and their position is not very important. However, recently, the coastal blockade has not been relaxed, the ports of eastern Zhejiang have been closed, the markets in the occupied territories have been prohibited from importing, and the situation in Southeast Asia is becoming more and more tense. Although international diplomatic activities are still uncertain, the general trend is that the United States and the Soviet Union are on the brink of war. If there are no sudden changes in the international situation in the future, there will be no way to open up the sales channels for cotton yarn. The degree of overproduction will become more serious. The demand for raw cotton will naturally decrease.

If the United States participates in the war, the import of American cotton to China will become a problem. However, the actual sales channels will also come to an end. In addition, recently, due to the easing of foreign exchange, manufacturers have taken the opportunity to settle a large amount of imported cotton. In addition, due to the reduction in working hours in March, cotton yarn consumption has also decreased. Therefore, the current cotton inventories in this city are also increasing sharply. Judging from the current operating conditions of yarn factories, the current cotton inventories are enough to supply more than five months of consumption in the future.

Although the New York cotton market has been rising in recent months (the current price per pound is about one cent higher than last month), fortunately, the exchange rate of Shanghai to the US dollar is also continuing to fall, which can offset the increase, and the burden on manufacturers has not increased as a result. As for transportation ships, after the presidential ship was requisitioned, a replacement has been designated to come to Shanghai. As Shanghai is the largest and last stronghold of American interests in China, as long as its role exists, transportation conditions and business relations will also exist. This can be asserted. Therefore, the fate of the cotton spinning industry in this city lies not in raw cotton but in actual sales. If actual sales cannot be opened up, the fragile foothold of the yarn market will not be improved.

### The Inside Story of Short Positions Paying Out

However, at this time and in this place, the sluggish actual sales are an irredeemable fate. There are nets outside and machines inside. Managing it depends only on speculative transactions. Knowing that speculative transactions are inherently prone to sharp rises and falls, knowledgeable people all know that moving to a better place is the right choice. However, those who are short-sighted do not plan for this. Instead, they use speculative activities to create various schemes in order to maintain yarn prices at a relatively high level. What they do is not enough. They know that this is not a long-term solution, but they only seek to temporarily raise yarn prices in order to sell spot goods and futures as much as possible, and obtain profits similar to scalping. When yarn prices fall back, the losses will belong to others. They can then safely produce the futures that have already been sold at high prices. After all the high-priced futures that have been sold have been produced in full, if yarn prices still do not improve, they can then find another way. Like the previous Double Horse market, it was called spot trading, but there was actually no time limit. This is to encourage hoarding. Charging interest to long positions and collecting warehouse rent is to increase their costs and ensure that yarn prices rise day by day. Yarn prices can rise faster than others. However, recently, due to the too high rise in yarn prices, and because short positions are not subject to time constraints, and because long positions have various burdens while short positions do not, people have changed to short positions. Especially since the surge in yarn prices in early May this year, short positions in the Double Horse market have become more favorable. As a result, the yarn market, which is overproduced, has become more and more depressed.

At a time when hoarding is rampant, prices of all goods are rising, and people's livelihoods are declining, anything that can suppress rising prices, no matter what the motive, seems to be beneficial to people's livelihoods and should be temporarily retained. The long positions' interest subsidy method is one example. Unfortunately, the so-called Double Horse market authorities did not plan for this. Instead, they reversed the previous system and created a short positions' payout method last week, opening a way out for yarn-hoarding long positions. They can transfer their interest burden to short positions. They seem to be afraid that people will not hoard yarn and that yarn prices will not rise.

Since the creation of the short positions' payout method, the yarn prices, which had been sluggish, jumped horizontally under the addition of long positions and the reversal of short positions, and surged nearly 100 yuan per bale last week. The short positions' payout method can be said to have fulfilled its responsibility for the price-raising plan. However, who can believe that the yarn market can be relied on only for speculation and be revived?

From the speculator's point of view, the interest to be paid by long positions can be offset by the payout of short positions. But in fact, long positions can only obtain a part of the short positions' payout, and the other part is obtained by the intermediaries. Therefore, long positions still need to bear part of the interest and still need to pay warehouse rent, so their total burden is actually no less than that of short positions. The only beneficiaries are speculative banks.

### Spot Prices More Expensive Than Futures, Getting Further and Further Apart

Not only that, at a time when yarn production is excessive, inventories are piled up, and external sales are extremely limited due to transportation difficulties and other factors, and the international situation is becoming more and more dangerous, the general trend is not optimistic. Looking back, since the opening of the so-called futures yarn market, futures yarn prices have always been 50 to 60 yuan lower than spot yarn prices. Last week, spot yarn prices surged nearly 100 yuan, while futures yarn prices rose only 40 yuan. Therefore, the difference between the two has now reached a huge 100 yuan. The bleak prospects of the yarn market can be seen. (Unit: Yuan)

When the so-called futures yarn market was first opened, speculators with strong financial strength sold spot goods to the spot yarn market and bought to the futures yarn market, obtaining huge arbitrage profits from it. At this stage, the futures yarn price should have moved in the opposite direction to the spot yarn price; in fact, the futures yarn still rose and fell with the spot yarn. Today, because the spot yarn is much more expensive than the futures yarn, short spot positions also changed to futures yarn to cover their position; therefore, the turnover of the futures yarn is almost equal to that of the spot yarn. Logically, the futures yarn should rise and fall in proportion to the spot yarn; in fact, the opposite is true. The spot yarn is surging, but the rise in the futures yarn is extremely limited, which is even more thought-provoking.

### News and Knowledge of the Yarn Market

— Spoken by Mr. Zhang Yifan, Notes by Feng Zhida

——Textbook for "Business Journalism" at the School of Commerce, University of Shanghai——

The modern textile industry in our country sprouted in 1890; ten years later, it faced competition from British merchants setting up factories in China; five years later, Japanese merchants followed suit. During World War I, the pressure from foreign merchants temporarily eased, and national industries were able to catch their breath; at that time, Chinese yarn businesses developed particularly rapidly. However, the competition from Japanese merchants also intensified simultaneously. As of before the August 13th Incident, Chinese merchants accounted for only 50% of the total number of spindles in the country, while Japanese merchants accounted for as much as 45%. British merchants were confined to a corner of Shanghai, and their position was no longer important. After the outbreak of the war, Chinese-owned yarn factories were either destroyed by artillery fire or "managed" by the Japanese. Only those in the Shanghai International Settlement survived. Statistics show that of the 2,628,000 spindles owned by Chinese merchants before the war, 1,200,000 were destroyed by artillery fire, and 862,000 were controlled by the Japanese. However, there were quite a few small-scale yarn factories newly established in the Shanghai International Settlement and various provinces in the southwest.

Count The fineness of cotton yarn is expressed in counts. Each count is 840 yards long, which is the same both domestically and abroad. For example, 10-count yarn is 8,400 yards long; 20-count yarn is 16,800 yards long. The lower the count, the coarser the yarn. Conversely, the higher the count, the finer the yarn. Generally, yarn below 19 counts is called coarse yarn, yarn above 20 counts is called medium yarn, and yarn above 45 counts is called fine yarn.

Bales of Yarn Cotton yarn is traded in bales, also known as pieces. Each bale weighs 400 pounds net. Each bale is divided into four grass bundles, and each grass bundle is divided into ten small bundles; each small bundle (or skein) weighs ten pounds and is divided into several yarn balls according to the count. For example, 10-count yarn is divided into ten yarn balls; 20-count yarn is divided into twenty yarn balls. Each yarn ball is uniformly divided into ten large skeins. Each large skein is further divided into seven small skeins. Each small skein is uniformly 840 yards long. Small bundles are wrapped in paper, and grass bundles are wrapped in grass bags. Large bales (i.e., bales) are wrapped in burlap and bound with iron hoops. The unit for reporting yarn prices and bidding prices is one large bale.

Types Cotton yarn can be classified by count, such as 10-count yarn and 20-count yarn; it can also be classified by fineness, such as coarse yarn and fine yarn. In terms of processing, there are distinctions between single-strand, double-strand, multi-strand, right-hand twist, and left-hand twist. Single-strand yarn is spun from a single strand of yarn, and those below 20 counts are all single-strand yarn. Double-strand yarn is spun from two strands of yarn, hence it is also known as "money." Fine yarn above 30 counts is sometimes twisted from three strands of yarn, which is what is called three-strand yarn. When spinning, yarn spindles that turn to the right are called right-hand twist; those that turn to the left are called left-hand twist. The yarn used in hand-operated wooden looms in rural areas is all right-hand twist. However, for machine weaving, the suitability of using right-hand or left-hand yarn depends on the arrangement of the machine. In addition, there are types such as lightning yarn and milky yarn. The former uses high-speed machines to pass the yarn through the flame of an electric arc, burning off the fine hairs on the yarn, resulting in a glossy product. The latter is immersed in caustic soda solution to give it a silk-like appearance.

Quality The quality of cotton yarn is determined by: (1) whether the color is good; (2) whether the thickness is uniform; (3) the strength of the twist; (4) the amount of fuzz. Yarn that is glossy in color, fine and uniform, can be stretched, and has less fuzz is considered to be of superior quality. Cotton yarn is traded on exchanges, so the quality of each product is first assessed to determine its grade; then, a certain type of yarn is designated as the standard product, so as to determine the limits of price increases or decreases for various yarns of the same or different grades.

Cost The cost of cotton yarn is broadly divided into two categories: one is the cost of raw cotton, and the other is the cost of manufacturing. The cost of raw cotton is the value of the raw cotton used. Generally, each bale of 20-count yarn uses about 350 pounds of raw cotton. The raw cotton cost is calculated by multiplying the current price of raw cotton by the amount of cotton used. Manufacturing costs include wages, power, management, taxes, and fire and water insurance costs per bale. Based on the current situation, the total cost of each bale of 20-count yarn should not exceed 1,345 yuan. Today's yarn prices have risen significantly, and the thick profits of manufacturers can be imagined.

Yarn Factories Yarn factories are the basic suppliers of the yarn market. Before the August 13th Incident, there were 31 Chinese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, with more than 1,237,000 spindles, producing more than 540,000 bales of yarn annually. There were more than 8,750 looms, producing 150,000 to 160,000 square yards of cloth annually. In addition, there were 33 Japanese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, with 1,358,000 spindles and more than 1,360 looms. There were four British-owned yarn factories, with 187,000 spindles and 2,890 looms, so they had long presented a situation of the guest overshadowing the host. After the outbreak of the war, as many as 21 yarn factories outside the concession area were damaged by the war, and 10 were "managed" by the Japanese. However, within the concession area, new yarn factories sprang up like mushrooms after rain. As of the end of February of this year, the existing yarn factories and their equipment in Shanghai are generally as shown in the following table.

It is estimated that if all the existing spindles in Chinese and foreign yarn factories in the city are put into operation, the maximum yarn production should be around 150,000 bales per month, requiring about 170,000 to 180,000 bales of raw cotton.

Raw Cotton Because domestic cotton has short fibers, yarns with higher counts need to be mixed with American cotton. Therefore, cotton imports have always been one of the biggest burdens on Shanghai's foreign exchange. This was the case before the war, and even more so during the war. Because cotton production in the occupied areas is controlled by the Japanese, and the amount of surplus cotton sold to Shanghai last year was only about 400,000 bales, factories need to rely even more on imports. In this environment of fluctuating exchange rates and unpredictable international situations, manufacturers are most concerned about the source of cotton. Precisely because of this, whenever foreign exchange rates are favorable, manufacturers import in large quantities, so the amount of raw cotton stored in Shanghai regularly maintains enough for more than half a year's needs.

Sales Channels Yarn is the main raw material for our clothing. Because of the abundance of yarn factories in Shanghai, it has always been the main supply area for cotton yarn in the country, with a considerable amount being re-exported every year. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the North China market was closed by Japanese merchants, followed by the closure of the gateways to Central China and even the occupied areas of South China. Therefore, the export of cotton yarn from this city is only limited to free China, and in recent years, attention has also been paid to the development of the Nanyang market. However, the absorption capacity of this new market accounts for at most only 5% to 6% of the total output, which is entirely absorbed by weaving factories in this city and the free areas in the southwest. Last autumn, the Japanese army intensified its blockade of our coast, followed by the British closure of the Burma Road. The inland gateways were completely closed. As a result, the yarn industry in this city was almost completely suffocated. Suspensions of work and reductions in work followed one after another, and the disastrous fall in yarn prices was beyond recovery. From this, it can be seen that the southwest sales channels are the lifeline of the yarn industry in this city.

Market Before the war, the cotton yarn trade in this city was concentrated in the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange. After the outbreak of the war, the exchange was ordered to close. Subsequently, speculative merchants organized a black market, which moved several times and is now located downstairs in a certain building at Tongli Geli on Beijing Road. Upstairs in the same building is the Japanese yarn market. It is designated that 20-count Shuangma yarn is the standard for all cotton yarn transactions, nominally only doing spot transactions, but in fact, there is no deadline constraint. Now, a futures market has been set up on Aidoa Road, trading in contracts with terms of one to two months. It also uses 20-count Shuangma as the standard, but it is called "Golden Shuangma," while spot Shuangma is called "factory order" to show the difference. Even so, spot Shuangma is still nominal, and it is still possible to buy and sell short, but the bulls have to pay interest every day, which is a major source of income for banks. The bears have no burden. But from last week, the bears also have to pay, and this money is collected by the bulls, so the bulls' interest burden is reduced. But speculators will not be stingy with this burden; what they are pursuing is greater profit.

Interest Payment This is the biggest source of income for banks. Currently, cotton yarn speculation starts with five bales. Each bale of cotton yarn is worth about 1,450 yuan, so five bales require a total of 7,250 yuan. Assuming a margin of 200 yuan is deducted, the bank nominally advances 7,050 yuan for the bull, and the monthly interest is calculated at 1.1%, so the bull's monthly interest burden is more than nine yuan. In addition, there are also storage and commission fees to be paid. In fact, the bank does not really advance funds to buy for the bull. At most, it only buys the excess amount of bulls after offsetting the bulls and bears on that day. If the excess amount is for the bears, then there is no need to advance funds to buy at all. However, it still charges interest from every bull customer. Now, this interest is paid by the bears. In the end, it is still collected by the bank. Moreover, because this payment amount is constantly changing, and the right to allocate it belongs to the bank, the bulls may not be able to collect it all, and the bank still has to divide a portion of it. This is another way to make money. Therefore, the victory of speculators belongs to the bank. (Note) This draft has been revised and supplemented by Mr. Zhang.

### Yarn and Cotton: Both American and Indian Cotton Markets Rise

The New York cotton market initially weakened due to good crop yield forecasts but rebounded due to purchases by spot traders and industry players. As a result, closing prices rose by 9 to 11 points compared to the previous day.

The Bombay cotton market rose due to purchases by speculators and industry players. As a result, closing prices rose by 0.50 to 4 rupees 75 compared to the previous day. Also, the forecast price has not yet been reached.

In addition, the following are Indian cotton statistics recorded from September 1, last year, to June 21, this year (per bale of 400 pounds):

Total listed in Bombay: 2,770,004 bales

Remaining in Bombay: 1,411,000 bales

Total listed in Karachi: 1,201,000 bales

Exports from Karachi: 1,134,000 bales

Remaining in Karachi: 275,000 bales

### North-South Goods: Jinshan Branches Progress Step by Step

Because this year's new Jinshan branch goods have been reported to have failed, the old goods in the Shanghai market have been progressing step by step. Yesterday, the market price of high-quality Yuan branches sold by Yuan Branch Shops reached 260 to 270 yuan, flat branches 170 to 180 yuan, and Lanzhu branches have also been shouting high. According to a letter from Zhangzhou, the new goods are only two tenths.

### Hainan Dried Longan Rises Sharply, Tianjin Almonds Arrive

Hainan dried longan, because there has been a recent lack of continuous arrivals, and most have been transferred to refrigerated warehouses, to seek future good prices, so the number of existing goods is even scarcer. Yesterday, it was heard that a number of goods opened by Beishi Haojia, with good appearance and color, rose by 30 yuan, and ordinary goods rose by more than 10 yuan. Hao goods are almost sold out, and the future market price of high-quality goods may reach 300 yuan.

Yesterday, 19 pieces of almonds were shipped from Tianjin, and 300 bags of raw peanuts came from Yantai.

### Miscellaneous Items: Soap and Matches Rise Together, Foreign Candles Also Follow Good Exchange Rates

Soap Raw materials such as coconut oil are rumored to have been secretly purchased by Germany, and then, with the frequent rise in cigarette prices on the market, all parties have resumed purchasing. Holders have tightened buying prices, and factory shipments are as sparse as stars in the morning. Therefore, prices have followed suit and risen. It is estimated that the new boxes of Guben Soap are 54 yuan, Baixiang Mao Soap 44 yuan, and Huangxiang Mao Soap 43 yuan, all up 3 to 4 yuan from before.

Matches It is rumored that the unified tax will be increased, and the establishment of a joint sales association is possible. Future buying prices will inevitably rise. Peers and hoarders continue to purchase and accumulate, so prices have continued to rise by white yuan compared to before. For example, Meili Pi has risen to 750 yuan per box, Fenghuang Brand 730 yuan, second-class miscellaneous brands 630 yuan, and third-class brands 580 yuan.

In addition, Baili's Ship Brand foreign candles, 28 yuan and 8 jiao per box, have also risen by 1 yuan and 5 jiao.

### Miscellaneous News: Woolen Fabrics and Materials Arrive, Butter Leather Also Comes to Shanghai

This year, the Shanghai woolen fabric market commonly says that, in addition to British foreign firms still accepting orders for Western woolen fabrics, it is unpredictable whether they can come to Shanghai due to changes in the current situation. Therefore, those inside and outside the industry are constantly hoarding goods, regarding them as rare treasures. Yesterday, 22 boxes of woolen fabrics and 418 pieces of wool were shipped from Hong Kong. With this support, manufacturers do not have to worry about not having goods to weave.

The price of Shanghai cowhide is also unprecedentedly high. Therefore, the price of shoe sole leather is high and difficult to purchase. Yesterday, 109 pieces of cowhide were also shipped from Hong Kong, and 198 pieces of butter came from Tianjin, which can be used for soap making and other purposes.

### Hardware: The Market for This Local Yuan Nail is Stagnant

The market for this local factory's Yuan nails, which has been without improvement for a long time, remains stagnant recently. Because the only outlet to the Nanyang Islands is currently without any search and receipt, and Beiyang gangs and inland river merchants on the Yangtze River Road are also uninterested, the transactions are only with small factories and scattered users in this street. Transactions are naturally quiet, and it is difficult to see the morale boosted. The market atmosphere remains sluggish. Recently, the asking price for each barrel of Beisi price is still 160 yuan, which has not seen honor or disgrace compared to the previous market. However, the bottom plate is particularly loose.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of Wang Danlao

— Sun Choucheng

Mr. Dan Kui has noble character and is a famous elder of Jiangsu. After resigning as a member of the Daohuai Committee, he lived in seclusion in agriculture, writing books and making speeches, asking about rain and assessing sunshine, enjoying himself leisurely. After the Incident, he lived in Shanghai and suffered from nasal cancer. Because of his old age and weakness, he passed away on the 17th of this month. The next day, the coffin was closed at the Central Funeral Home. Many students and old friends went to see him off, and when talking about the longevity of this elder (82 years old), it was due to his moderation in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Excerpts are taken to fulfill this publication.

Mr. Wang was originally from Nanjing, followed officials to Chongming, and Du Yan Gong died in Chongming. The family could not support the coffin back to their hometown, so they were buried outside the northeast city, and then lived in Chongming. He was poor at home and worked hard, so he always used cotton fabrics for "clothing" and did not seek beauty. After gaining fame in the Gengchen year, he went from the Shuchang Scattered Library Department Cao to Nanyang to investigate commerce, and then served as a Shangbu Canyi Right Cheng. He still adhered to the principle of wearing coarse cloth clothes and rarely made silk clothes. He also strongly discouraged luxury in the clothes worn by his family. Because Chongming produces cotton, his family's style focuses on diligence and thrift, not only growing and spinning their own cotton, but also dyeing and making it themselves. Clean and simple is enough to describe it. He had no bad habits in his life and hated opium even more. His father, Mr. Pingyi, gave him the name Qingmu, which contained the meaning of encouraging him to emulate Lin Wenzhong Gong as a famous Confucian and a famous minister. Mr. Wang regarded Wenzhong's political achievements, banning opium, and dissolving Liuhe as the most important, so he wrote articles to persuade the people to reject drugs and wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with Britain about the official sale of opium in Hong Kong, criticizing in words and writing without any effort. Regarding water conservancy, he wrote books such as "The Strategy of Water Control and Disaster Prevention in the Taihu Basin" and "A Brief Description of Inspecting the Liuhe Qipu Baimao Water Conservancy," with thorough discussions and benefits to people's livelihood. He did not seek beauty in "food" and embraced the principle of being frugal and refined in diet, regarding garden vegetables as more precious than delicacies, so he was a vegetarian in his later years. In view of the soaring rice prices and the difficulty of civilian life, in addition to writing three articles on rice, he once wrote to the authorities, advocating to investigate the households that need food and flat rice, compile registers, and order wealthy people to donate funds to run flat rice sales, and determine the amount of flat rice sales according to the number of people, so that there would be no partiality. The measures he set were fair, detailed, and worthy of emulation. He did not advocate building luxurious houses for "housing." In the fourth year of the Republic of China, he built a tomb for his parents' coffins behind Dashiqiao in Baochenxi, 50 miles from the city, and then built a house on the left of the tomb to live in, named Nongyinlu. In addition to reading the Rites, he arranged the tomb fields. On the left, right, and rear three sides of the hut, he dug ditches to store fish. There was a bamboo garden to the north of the ditch, a lotus pond at the gate, and a small garden. Along the road, ditches, and plants, there were thousands of elm, catalpa, locust, and willow trees, like a rural home. On weekdays, he mingled with farmers and interacted with villagers and elders. Because he was grateful for the help of the villagers during construction, he named this area Deyicun. He founded Shecang to imitate Zhu Zi's method of spring distribution and autumn collection, and donated a Qiuqiji Elementary School with an attached agricultural experiment field, so that students could learn farming in their spare time. He spent time talking about mulberry and hemp with farmers, as if it were the first Taohuayuan. After the Incident, he moved to Shanghai, and the rented house was unusually small. In view of the insatiable greed of Shanghai's second landlords, he wrote articles to advise them, but those who were taught were sincere, and those who listened were disdainful. This is also clear evidence that people's hearts are not ancient, only value money, and do not abide by morality. The problem of "transportation" is greatly related to Mr. Wang. During the Qing Dynasty, the discussion of the Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway's commercial operation was very heated. Mr. Wang was elected as the director and pioneered the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. In the Xinhai year, he had a brief discussion on advising Suzhou railway shareholders to recover the Nanqian railway funds and organize a bank. In addition to detailing the advantages and disadvantages of state-owned and commercially operated railways, he advocated strict supervision of the government's large foreign debts to increase the burden on the people. It was very thorough. Last year, he also wrote "The Painful History of China's Self-Run Railway," lamenting that the railways were nationalized, and the commercially operated shares were either returned or reduced slightly. The loss of the people's investment was small. He borrowed foreign debts to build them, and the loss of rights and interests and the extension of the term of the railway debts caused great losses to the people. As for his personal travel, he advocated walking in his youth, and did not prepare a chartered car in his later years. His contentment with poverty and love of Taoism is even more worthy of imitation.

### New York's Chinese Summer Fashion

— Zhang Mengzhao

Take the strengths of others to make up for one's own weaknesses, so I often advocate that Chinese studies should be the warp, and Western studies should be the weft. Chinese and Western exchanges will lead to great achievements in academics. This is true of spiritual culture, and why not of material things? The advantage of Chinese clothing is comfort. The disadvantage is inconvenience. The advantage of Western clothing is convenience, but the disadvantage is tightness. If they can be used together, taking the strengths and making up for the weaknesses, wouldn't that be wonderful? Recently, I read a New York communication that said, "...On May 25th, at the closing of the American China Aid Week, a Chinese cloth exhibition was held at the Hotel Astor in New York, inviting the press to publicize it widely. Among them, patterns such as dragons and phoenixes, ancient coins, butterflies, flower girls, and figures all have the flavor of ancient Chinese times. They are elegant, pleasing to the eye, and warmly welcomed by the local American women. Currently, 65 famous American weaving factories have unanimously participated in weaving, according to the above-mentioned various patterns, weaving 4.5 million yards, which is designated as the 1941 style... At the same time, Ms. Zhang Qianyang, a Chinese living in the United States, gave a speech on Chinese styles at the Biltimore Hotel on the afternoon of June 4th, explaining the influence of Chinese styles on American women's summer fashion styles in 1941. She also said that the Chinese styles she introduced were not directly copied from Chinese samples, but were the result of indirect influence; for example, the "Lotus Leaves Emerging from Water" picture she saw in Hangzhou indirectly inspired her to improve the shape of the "Chinese Umbrella" and influenced the style of the "Chinese Umbrella" she introduced. Ms. Zhang has maintained close contact with the American United Relief Association to promote Chinese styles..." I often see Western women wearing Chinese cheongsams, looking graceful and beautiful, while the so-called progressive Chinese women's clothing is bought by many masters, and there are gifts such as wooden boxes and stoves. Today, not to mention that the gifts are neither Chinese nor Western, isn't it strange? To cherish the national essence, we should pay attention to our country's inherent "summer fashion" and use ingenuity to plant, cultivate, and promote it. I look forward to it.

### One Week's Family Meal Plan

— Ms. Huaying

The vegetables and beans that are on the market in early summer, the knife beans are old, and the green peppers are also spicy: fortunately, the eggplant is just right. There are two types of eggplant, the thin and long one is the Ningbo variety, and the thick and conical one is the local variety. The Ningbo variety has fewer seeds and is glutinous, which the local variety cannot match. The current price is about 2.5 jiao per catty, and from an economic point of view, you can also eat it. My family loves to eat eggplant, so we have been eating it every day for the past few days. Dong's method has three types. One is eggplant stuffed with meat, digging out the eggplant belly and chopping the pork into mince and adding good soy sauce to stuff it in. The second is deep-fried eggplant with batter, breaking up and stirring eggs and putting them in flour, and cutting the eggplant into sections and dragging them in flour to deep-fry. The third is stir-fried eggplant with shrimp roe, which is very simple. You only need to buy some dried shrimp roe from the southern goods store and stir-fry it with the eggplant. As for the vegetarian method, one is to braise the eggplant with sweet sauce, and the other is to steam the eggplant and mix it with soy sesame oil or sesame sauce, which are both very delicious.

### Coal Balls, Past and Present

— Jing Shusen

"Tofu and meat are the same price" - this sentence was originally a description of the high price of things; but now, it can almost be said: "It has become a reality." That said, if you compare it with other commodity prices, then, the price, which is less than ten times different from before the war, is not very expensive! Because there are even more expensive commodity prices that I can tell you!

What are even more expensive commodity prices? I think readers will definitely point out the rice price of 150 yuan per stone, right? Yes, rice prices are indeed very expensive, but the ratio of its difference from before the war is still less than fifteen or sixteen times; only coal balls, which cost seventeen or eighteen yuan per load, exceed the pre-war price by more than ten times. This ratio is truly shocking!

Our lives depend entirely on eating to maintain; except for melons and fruits, which can be eaten raw, everything else must be cooked? Like in rural areas, you can still use other plants as fuel, but only in this city of Shanghai, because of the population, location, and equipment, you must use coal balls!

I remember that before the war, coal balls were only 70 or 80 cents per load; if you were old, you wouldn't even be able to buy official goods. Often, you would pay a high price and buy inferior goods. People's hearts are not ancient; this is extremely

Recently, in the newspaper, someone claiming to be a "sucker" posted a large advertisement about coal balls. This is a well-intentioned person with a lot of bitterness, worthy of our praise!

In fact, doing business and buying and selling is a legitimate act of seeking profit from capital; however, in this period of national crisis, engaging in hoarding and raising prices is already a criminal offense; now that you have raised someone else's price, you still want to let people be "sucked." Is this something that a "person" should do! Although merchants love profit more than rulers love beauty, don't "forget" the "eight" characters "genuine goods at fair prices, honest to all ages" hanging on your door!

### New Discussions on "Living" Overseas

— Xin Liang

A department store in New York recently installed a new type of lighting equipment that is almost indistinguishable from sunlight. They installed many 1,000-watt Nova-Lux lamps inside the white walls. The light is first reflected from the walls, making it soft and brilliant. People even think it's sunlight. When turning the lights on or off in the morning or evening, this novel light doesn't suddenly brighten or dim, but gradually changes over about fifteen minutes. Isn't this just like the moment before the sun rises or sets?

Sears, Roebuck and Co. in Chicago is the only store in the world without glass windows. The engineer who built this house said that regulating air and equipping lights in this type of glassless building is easier to manage than others. Furthermore, operating expenses can be reduced significantly. The goods in the store are no longer exposed to strong sunlight and damaged; the noise from outside can all be avoided, and besides, we can save a lot of wall space to store goods.

Brief News: The Modern Celebrity Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition, hosted by Cunde Middle School at 149 Guba Road, will officially open on the 27th of this month. The exhibition will last for two days and close on the 29th. Twenty percent of the sales proceeds will be used specifically for scholarship loans. At the same time, the labor products of all primary and secondary school students, such as toys, embroidery, and knitting, will be sold in a charity sale. This action benefits poor students and is indeed significant.

Spring and Autumn

### Suicide

— Jue Hui

When it comes to something that can truly shine through the ages and be immortal, nothing is more suitable than suicide.

The origins of suicide, and who started it, have been lost to classical research; but it has existed since ancient times, so there is no need to avoid talking about it. If you don't believe it, there is plenty of evidence:

In the past, women could not easily be seen by others. A maiden in her boudoir, for "some reason," was glanced at by a "slick rogue." She cried for three days, starved for three days, and silently hanged herself from the beam.

In the past, men were not allowed to show their faces in public except to study and seek fame. A scholar from a scholarly family went to the street "in person" to buy a pancake. His wife, upon hearing the news, immediately jumped into the well and died.

This proves that current suicides are not only "seeking antiquity"; but also a secret recipe handed down from ancestors!

But the methods have become scientific: raw opium, lysol, arsenic, electricity, the Huangpu River is uncovered, and so on.

The reasons have also expanded: family property gambled away, burdened with debt; the cosmetics market, empty-handed; love battlefield, defeated in a love triangle; and some are truly because they have no food to eat. And so on.

However, although progress has been made step by step, the sensation is far less than in ancient times! Previously, suicide might still have the hope of erecting a monument of chastity; but now, even providing a coffin is precarious; probably because there are too many such events, it is not surprising.

In fact, thinking calmly: "A good death is better than a bad life"; living and fighting hard can still accomplish two things, is there really a ghost after death?

Especially at the moment, today, at this very minute, we simply cannot find any reason to commit suicide...

Those who commit suicide are all "insects" in Ah Q's mouth!

### Talking About Tuition Fees

— Xu Daming

In today's world where the prices of everything are skyrocketing, tuition fees are certainly no exception. Because the living expenses of teachers and staff are also rising along with the high prices, the school's expenses have to increase as well. Therefore, we say that due to unavoidable price increases, it is "understandable" today - in order to overcome this "difficult time" together.

However, we must pay attention to the fact that some principals are using the school as a "speculative market" under the pretext of "huge expenses."

Therefore, at the moment when schools throughout Shanghai are discussing how to increase tuition and miscellaneous fees for the next semester, we have the need to provide methods.

This can be divided into two aspects:

First, regarding private schools, this issue is relatively serious, because the power to increase or decrease private school tuition fees is in the hands of the principal alone, but this is not without solutions. One is to exert collective strength—the families of all students (or start by implementing it by grade, and then gradually expand it to the entire school, which may be easier) must have an organization that is responsible for reviewing. In this way, the tuition fees of their children can achieve the effect of cooperation between the school and the family. At the same time, teachers can also be contacted to supervise together.

Second, we know that most private schools in Shanghai receive the "Shanghai Municipal Council Private School Subsidy." Therefore, in addition to being responsible for the preliminary assessment and investigation of the equipment of each school, the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council should pay more attention to the economic avenues of each school after receiving the subsidy, especially the expenses of tuition and miscellaneous fees. The Chinese Education Department should be responsible for providing advice to avoid increasing the burden on parents. We hope that this can be combined with the above point and carried out simultaneously to exert greater power.

Secondly, we must also consider the issue of fee increases in public schools.

But this is not an unsolvable problem. From the perspective of the Shanghai Municipal Council: First, reduce the rate of fee increases and automatically reduce the burden on parents; second, increase the number of free places. Third, we have seen Mr. Sheng Zhensheng’s "Report on the Implementation of the Half-Day Double-Shift System for Primary Schools" in the "Primary School Teachers" monthly magazine. After reading it, we feel that the Shanghai Municipal Council should increase the number of schools of this nature (low tuition fees and supplies provided by the Shanghai Municipal Council) as much as possible so that children in the concession have the opportunity to enroll universally. However, one thing must be noted, that is, schools of this nature should also be increased to complete primary schools for fifth and sixth grades, because after graduating at the age of four, it seems more difficult than ascending to the sky to find a career under today's unreasonable social system. This is something that the Chinese Education Department should strive for.

As for the parents, they can also jointly request the school authorities to explain the reasons for such a large increase in fees.

In short, schools should understand the difficulties of families, and parents should also understand the situation and difficulties of the school (referring to some schools that are truly running schools). If everyone can understand each other, understand each other, and then develop the effect of helping each other, and overcome the difficulties of today, that is the best policy. As for those who only care about the interests of a few private individuals and act arbitrarily, then we should unceremoniously use collective power to sanction them!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(9) A Strange Farmer

But the gauze problem could not be solved like this. Begonia was always extremely distressed by his face, which had been mutilated like a monster. According to his wishes, he really didn't want to walk out of Li's Village with this ugly face exposed. But Old Master Wu had another opinion, believing that if a person covered a large piece of gauze on their face, the appearance would inevitably be too mysterious. It would be very easy to attract attention in normal times, let alone in this time of chaotic soldiers and horses and drastic changes in the situation.

"In case people in the team see you as a spy, it will be too late to explain!" The nearly seventy-year-old uncle kept rubbing his dry hands that looked like chicken feet as he said.

Begonia tied and untied the piece of gauze left over from three years ago on his face dozens of times. Until the very moment before setting off, he decided to listen to his uncle's advice and discarded the gauze. He only pulled the brim of his felt hat down extra low to cover the upper part of his face.

A broken mule cart carried him. After traveling for most of the day, they arrived at Waguanji near the canal.

From here to Cangxian Station on the Jinpu Railway, there were still about thirty miles to go. It was obviously impossible to finish the journey that day, so Begonia followed his cousin's suggestion and went into an inn to rest together.

The inns in small northern towns are always very low and dark. It happened to be near dusk again. The waiter walked into the room carrying a kerosene lamp. In the dim, gray light, he suddenly saw Begonia's appearance after taking off his hat and was almost so frightened that he dropped the lamp in his hand.

"What do you two want to eat?" The waiter ignored Begonia, who was wearing a long gown, and instead asked Wu Da, who was wearing short clothes and shorts. He was obviously extremely frightened by that ugly face.

"First bring a plate of smoked meat. Is it okay to have thirty thin pancakes?" Wu Da asked his brother, while lighting a cigarette and putting it in his mouth to smoke. (139)

Everyone says that things are expensive and life is difficult;

But everyone says that the shells at the wine and vegetable restaurants are not expensive for 40 yuan a table and the wine and drinks for 100 or 20 yuan a table.

But people use a hundred lights in the big warehouse to play mahjong all night long.
