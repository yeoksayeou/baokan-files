### Britain and the United States Complete Preparations in the Far East to Prevent Further Japanese Aggression. Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras is Confident that U.S.-Japan Negotiations Will Uphold Promises and Not Harm Chinese Interests

United Press, Singapore, 20th. Before his recent departure for Batavia, former British Minister of Information, Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras, granted an exclusive interview to a United Press reporter. According to Mr. Aras, "I am deeply confident that Washington, in any negotiations with Tokyo, will absolutely respect the rights and interests of China." Mr. Aras also told the reporter, "The American people have decided to stop aggression. The free nations of the Pacific and the East must maintain their independence and integrity." When asked about his impressions from his recent trip to the United States, Mr. Aras stated, "The entire country, including the Midwest, is united in destroying Nazism. I am fully aware that the people there (in the Midwest) fully understand the dangers the United States faces in the international situation." Mr. Aras also pointed out that the resolution passed by the American Legion at its convention in Milwaukee reflects the attitude and determination of the United States. Regarding the situation in the Pacific, Mr. Aras said, "Rumors and misinformation have been constantly spreading, claiming that the United States advocates a policy of appeasement in the Pacific. However, this is merely wishful thinking." The Far Eastern situation has greatly improved recently due to the close cooperation between Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, China, and the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that the increasingly solidified Singapore fortress will be the defense line for the entire East and the Pacific. It is reinforced by the powerful bases of Hawaii, Midway Island, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and New Zealand, making its strength more than sufficient to resist any aggression that disrupts the peace of the Pacific. Mr. Aras stated, "People in my country have told me that the Dutch East Indies is currently building strong defenses and is in excellent contact with us and the United States." During his flight from Hawaii to Singapore, the pilots included two Dutch rubber plantation owners who briefed him on the defenses of the Dutch East Indies. They said that all Dutch people spend a day and a night each week training and working with the local troops. The Dutch East Indies has 2,500 excellent aircraft, mostly from the United States, and its coastal defenses are impregnable. They said their only major concern was parachute landings, so they are focusing their training on combating parachute troops. Finally, Mr. Aras said, "As long as the powerful U.S. fleet remains in the Pacific, it is doubtful that Japan would dare attempt to land in Hawaii, as this would be tantamount to suicide." Mr. Aras emphasized that the future of humanity depends on the effectiveness of democratic national defense. "For civilization to achieve its highest progress, Britain and the United States must have a deep understanding, and the Pacific will become increasingly important due to advancements in transportation and the development of resources," he said.

United Press, Singapore, 20th. Sir Thomas Shenton Whitelegge Thomas, Governor of the Straits Settlements, declared today in an exclusive interview with a United Press reporter that Britain and the United States will cooperate with any country that hopes for peace in the Pacific. However, Britain and the United States are determined to prevent "massive aggression." Sir Thomas stated, "In recent months, Britain and the United States have developed reasonable and necessary cooperation in the Pacific." He said that Washington fully understands the problems in the Pacific, and Britain is also making every effort to avoid making mistakes due to lack of preparation. Sir Thomas emphasized that modern warfare relies on economics and industry for 75 percent. He said that the supply of rubber, tin, and other raw materials essential to American industry, commerce, and agriculture is in the Pacific and the East and is controlled by countries friendly to the United States. Sir Thomas also warmly praised President Roosevelt's ability to understand international affairs in detail and to demonstrate his great leadership in a vast continent where differences of opinion are inevitable. Sir Thomas also stated that supplies from the United States have already arrived. Although the Lend-Lease Act has not yet been practically applied to Singapore, all future imports will be shipped in accordance with the Act. He said that before requesting any supplies, the actual defense needs of the Straits Settlements, especially regarding steel, are being thoroughly considered by the supply director. He declared that American assistance is highly valued, but he hopes that this assistance will increase due to the common problems of Britain and the United States in the Pacific. When asked about his views on the situation, Sir Thomas replied with a smile, "I am not worried about the past, nor have I ever been worried."

If the Dutch East Indies is Attacked, Britain Will Swiftly Come to the Rescue

Mr. Aras will Meet with Mr. Clark Kerr

United Press, Batavia, 20th. Former British Minister of Information, Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras, strongly implied yesterday that Singapore troops may be immediately dispatched to the Dutch East Indies. Mr. Aras has a special mission in Singapore. He criticized Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pownall, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Far East, for saying that British troops stationed in Malaya could not defend the Dutch East Indies without direct approval from London. "I believe the British will take the quickest possible action (if the Dutch East Indies is attacked). The Netherlands is our ally."

British Outpost in the Far East Becomes a Strong Fortress

Impressions of an American Reporter Visiting Singapore

United Press, Singapore, 20th. The impression gained from a fleeting visit to Singapore is that the area is already prepared to act when necessary. The authorities are determined to avoid the mistakes of unpreparedness made in Europe. Singapore's defenses are being strengthened daily, and troops are constantly arriving here from the mother country and various parts of the Empire. These troops are among the best in the Empire, eager to fight. Singapore is a springboard for protecting the eastern Pacific, and its defense plan is the same as Hawaii's. If any war occurs in the Pacific, it is clear that naval and air forces must be used to protect the security of naval bases and to attack enemy ships, supplies, and transportation centers. Many new air bases with underground storage rooms are scattered throughout many areas. These airfields have many American aircraft. Singapore's naval base has 22 square miles of deep-water anchorage, more than enough to accommodate the combined British and American navies.

Our Assistance Will Not Be Delayed." Regarding the general situation in the Pacific, he said, "Australia's responsibilities in the Pacific and the world are increasing daily. Australia is now taking active action. Its development is similar to that of the United States before the Civil War." Mr. Aras also said that the purpose of his trip was to meet with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies to lay the foundation for an "ABCD diplomatic front." He also stated that in addition to assisting the British Ambassador ("Governor-General") and Consul-General in political matters, he also hopes to promote closer British-Dutch relations. Regarding Japan, Mr. Aras said, "Things are currently in a dormant state, but it cannot be said that the crisis has passed." He also said that he believes that at the beginning of the European war, Britain was unprepared in Europe, but "we are now preparing here to prevent the scourge of aggression. If we had prepared in 1939, there would not have been aggression in Europe." Accompanying Mr. Aras was his wife, Lady Diana Aras. They will return to Singapore on Sunday to meet with the British Ambassador to China, Mr. Clark Kerr, who is traveling from Chongqing to Singapore.

United Press, Simla, 20th. It was learned here yesterday that the international trade management issues discussed in the important meeting in Singapore, especially focusing on economic warfare. The meeting began last week, and representatives of the British Empire are holding talks with former British Minister of Information, Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras.

Editorial

### Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras’s Correct Remarks

Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras, the British special envoy to the Far East, is currently visiting the Dutch East Indies and plans to visit Australia before returning to Singapore to meet with the British Ambassador to China, Mr. Clark Kerr. Undoubtedly, amidst the intermittent U.S.-Japan talks, Mr. Aras, based on his original mission, is intensifying the close cooperation of the ABCD group in the Far East. His statements can, of course, somewhat represent the common intentions of this group. Before leaving Singapore, he made a statement to American reporters, emphasizing: "I am deeply confident that Washington, in any negotiations with Tokyo, will absolutely respect Chinese interests." After arriving in Batavia, he spoke twice more, first saying, "The current tranquility in the Far East is definitely not due to the United States sacrificing China to negotiate with Japan," and then, "The situation is currently in a dormant state, but it cannot be readily assumed that the crisis has passed." He also implied that if the Dutch East Indies is attacked, the British army in Singapore may immediately be dispatched to assist.

From these two short statements, at least two points can be seen: first, Britain and the United States will absolutely not betray China; and second, although exploratory talks are taking place between the United States and Japan, the vigilance and cooperation of the democratic front in the Far East have absolutely not been relaxed as a result. If anyone, because of the failure of the U.S.-Japan talks, hastily believes that the overall situation in the Far East can now be worry-free, that would be the same mistake as mistakenly thinking that President Roosevelt intended to sacrifice China to appease Japan because the United States attempted to suppress Japan through negotiations. While a spokesman for the Japanese army declared, "Regardless of any opposition, we are determined to proceed with the war against China and obtain raw materials from the Dutch East Indies," Mr. Aras has made clear statements that the crisis has not passed and that the British army is determined to assist the Dutch East Indies. Although this may be a coincidental coincidence, it is not without a sense of confrontation and unwillingness to show weakness.

Originally, we have long said that Japan's talks with the United States are not sincerely seeking reconciliation or thoroughly repenting its misdeeds. In reality, it is only because both objective circumstances and internal conditions are temporarily unfavorable to carrying out new adventurous actions, and the economic sanctions imposed by Britain and the United States are indeed sufficient to isolate Japan to death. Therefore, it is happy to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is preparing to free up its forces to deal with the situation in Europe to hold talks with Washington in order to delay the time and slightly relieve the suffering of economic suffocation. However, regardless of whether negotiations have reached an agreement or are still in progress, if any unexpected changes occur in the international situation, allowing Japan to once again have an opportunity to take advantage of, then anyone who dares to assert that Tokyo's radicals will definitely make a comeback, reverting to their old ways. All promises, guarantees, and even all agreements will be equal to waste paper. Precisely because of this reason, we have always believed that President Roosevelt's U.S.-Japan talks, if not for other purposes, or similarly intending to delay the time in order to complete the necessary preparations in all aspects, especially in the Far East defense, before actually using force, then it seems that he is making an unnecessary move.

Judging from Mr. Aras's tireless efforts and the fact that the Chinese army has not yet launched a general counteroffensive, it can be seen that although the entire front of the ABCD group in the Far East has been established, the specific methods for each item related to technology, especially the issue of military supply and military cooperation, seem to still have room for active enrichment and adjustment. Therefore, the interpretation mentioned above that President Roosevelt's talks with Japan are intended to take the opportunity to complete the necessary preparations may not be without reason. From China's perspective, the most terrifying thing is that the United States engages in negotiations with Japan while neglecting to support the democratic group in the Far East. However, the facts now prove that this is absolutely not the case. Not only has President Roosevelt expressed his intention to step up aid to China in the implementation report of the Lend-Lease Act, but also the fact that he has sent a military delegation of as many as forty people to China and that the Dutch East Indies has 2,500 excellent warplanes, mostly from the United States, as Mr. Aras mentioned yesterday, is enough to prove that the United States' anti-aggression policy and its determination to defend the integrity of the Far East have absolutely not changed.

Under these circumstances, we believe that the most important point is that the democratic front itself, including China, must not neglect the necessary vigilance or relax the necessary arrangements due to some recent so-called "truce" atmosphere. Based on the above-mentioned reasons that Japan cannot be trusted to abide by any constraints, regardless of whether the U.S.-Japan negotiations will be successful, the source of trouble in the Far East has not been fundamentally eradicated. Therefore, it must not be mistakenly believed that the crisis has disappeared. Mr. Aras's statement yesterday is a crucial warning to every democratic force in the Far East.

Japan Closely Watches the Development of the European War

East Reports Government's Cautious Diplomacy

Reuters, Tokyo, 20th. The "Chugai Commercial News" predicts that if Leningrad, Kiev, and Odessa fall in succession before winter arrives, the German-Soviet war situation can be decided. The United Kingdom and the United States have no ability to assist the Soviet Union in preventing the advance of the German army. Soon, the Soviet Union will change its war policy.

Havas, Tokyo, 19th. The Japanese "Guangzhi Shimbun" recently published an editorial advising the government not to lightly disclose the current stage of negotiations between Japan and the United States, stating that during negotiations between the two governments, there are often stages involving larger goals. The government can weigh the pros and cons and publicly disclose these goals to the people in order to gain their support or prevent opposition actions. Especially at present, the international situation is intricate and subtle. Those who practice diplomacy may inadvertently fall into danger. Therefore, the people should place complete trust in the highest authorities and their responsible advisors and should not act rashly. It should be understood that diplomatic negotiations are like commercial negotiations, with every ounce being contested. Government personnel should act alone without public interference. Otherwise, if they succeed, they will gain trust and thus retain their positions. If they unfortunately fail, they will only have to retire, which is not a good policy.

### U.S.-Japan Negotiations are in Progress. President Roosevelt Did Not Disclose the Nature of the Talks When Receiving Reporters

Reuters, Washington, 20th. Yesterday, when President Roosevelt received reporters from various newspapers, he refused to discuss the nature of his talks with Japanese Ambassador Nomura, saying that there was no new news regarding Japanese issues or the Far East situation in the past 24 hours. President Roosevelt also stated that his talks with Secretary of State Hull on Friday did not involve Far Eastern issues and that he meets or speaks with the Secretary of State from time to time to discuss all international developments.

China Has Undergone Four Years of Bloodshed, and National Consciousness Has Become More Resilient

U.S. Sanctions Against Japan Must Not Be Relaxed. Ambassador Hu Shih Delivers a Speech in the United States

Hafner Agency, Cincinnati, 20th. Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shih, said in a speech at the Annual Meeting of the Life Insurance Association of America: "The economic embargo imposed by the United States has begun to show a significant impact on the national life and military arrogance of Japan. I deeply believe that once the American people have fully recognized the astonishing effectiveness of this economic weapon, they will not relax or abandon it in the slightest until this measure successfully awakens the Japanese military and the Japanese people to the clear lesson that aggression does not pay and that war is suicide." When discussing the Sino-Japanese war, Ambassador Hu said, "We still have vast land and unlimited manpower. Our unified national historical consciousness has undergone a new baptism of fire and blood, and it is stronger and more unyielding than before. Japan's political isolation and spiritual rejection have long been completed due to its own actions, and the suffocating economic encirclement of Japan is also being completed."

### Fierce Fighting in Ukraine. Germany Claims to Have Occupied Kiev. Moscow and London Have Not Yet Confirmed. Soviet Troops Resist Strongly, Fighting for Every Inch of Land

United Press, Berlin, 20th. The German High Command issued a special communique yesterday stating that after breaking through the strong fortifications on the west bank of the Dnieper River, German troops entered Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, yesterday morning.

Reuters, London, 20th. Although Germany has officially announced that it has entered Kiev, the Soviet communique issued at noon did not announce any changes in the situation there, only stating that the fighting in the Ukrainian capital region was extremely fierce. London has also not confirmed the fall of Kiev, believing that German propaganda cannot be trusted. The Soviet Command may have decided to leave powerful troops in prominent locations to implement its planned strategy. There is also no news of continued progress by German forces in the Murmansk region. The Soviet army's mouthpiece, Red Star, said that in recent attacks approaching Kiev, Germany lost ten divisions, hundreds of tanks, and hundreds of aircraft. Even if Kiev is indeed occupied by German forces, it will deal a heavy blow to the Soviet Union, but Germany has also suffered heavy losses after fighting around it for many days. The loss of Kiev is not yet considered extremely important. If the German army advances further east, the Soviet Union's war industry will face a greater threat.

Reuters, Moscow, 19th. It is admitted here that the situation in Kiev is serious, but the soldiers and civilians defending the city have not yet given up their determination to fight for every inch of land. During the offensive in the first half of August, German troops once reached the outskirts of Kiev at the cost of 20,000 soldiers being buried in the battlefield and a large number of war machines being destroyed, but were eventually forced to retreat due to the strong resistance of the defenders. Now, disregarding unprecedented losses, they have once again attacked a certain part of the Kiev defense line.

German War Report

Hafner Agency, Headquarters of the Führer, 20th. This afternoon, the German war report stated that German infantry, after days of arduous fighting, and with the assistance of the Air Force, broke through the strong defensive works of the Soviet army in Kiev. Yesterday, German troops ventured to break through the city of Kiev and hoisted the German flag high above the citadel. After the Soviet commander fled Kiev, the Soviet troops defending the city surrendered and laid down their arms. German troops had already occupied the city of Poltava the day before yesterday. As a result of the joint offensive by German ground, naval and air forces in mid-September, they occupied Moon Island and Worm Island, not far from the Gulf of Riga. Last night, German aircraft bombed Odessa and Moscow.

Hafner Agency, Berlin, 20th. The first news of the German occupation of Kiev to reach Berlin was a telephone report from war correspondent Senck, who said: "We crossed the small river into Kiev fully armed at midnight. We were shivering with cold on the riverbank, but our teeth did not chatter. When we climbed to the defense line, we were ordered to attack. Hand grenades and flame throwers were used together. After the first defensive work was captured, we learned that we would encounter the secret police team. We proceeded step by step, and by dusk, Kiev was completely in our hands. The city's ammunition depots were first bombed by aircraft and then bombarded with the largest caliber artillery."

### British Delegation Departs for Moscow. Large Quantities of War Equipment are Shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 20th. Lord Beaverbrook, Minister Without Portfolio, who is leading the British delegation to Moscow, has now departed for. Before leaving, he said that British industry has stepped up production to fully support the Soviet Union and will build an unprecedented number of tanks.

The Soviet Union will soon have a large number of American-made aircraft and tanks. Harriman also said that his mission is entirely technical and that he will have interesting talks with the United Kingdom to jointly analyze the entire issue of providing supplies to aid the Soviet Union. This task is extremely important, and it has now been proven that both the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have determination and pay attention to it. Several American technicians will also travel to the Soviet Union.

### Twelve British Warships Under Repair in the United States

United Press, Washington, 20th. Secretary of the Navy Knox announced yesterday that twelve British warships are currently under repair in American seaports, including one battleship, two aircraft carriers, five cruisers, one submarine, two gunboats, and one minesweeper.

German Troops Continue to Advance Adventurously to the East; Four Soviet Armies Are Surrounded

United Press, London, 20th. British military experts here believe that some Soviet armies in Kiev have been surrounded by German troops and are in danger of being annihilated. The troops of General von Rundstedt of the German army are tightening their pressure on Crimea and advancing towards the Kharkov and Donets industrial areas. However, British military experts also believe that these surrounded Soviet troops may be able to break through the encirclement, as in Minsk. Some even believe that the troops of General von Rundstedt, who encircled the Soviet troops east of Kiev, may soon be counter-encircled by the Soviet troops.

Havas, Vichy, 19th. After German troops crossed the Dnieper River at Kremenchug, they continued to advance to the northeast and have occupied the city of Poltava (90 miles southwest of Kharkov and 300 miles southeast of Kiev).

Kiev is the Second Largest City in the Soviet Union and Occupies an Important Position in History

Havas, Vichy, 19th

Military figures here attach great importance to the German occupation of Kiev, believing that this will have a significant impact on the Soviet Union and the entire Slavic world. Kiev is the capital of the Ukrainian Republic and is very important in Russian history. It is also the cultural center of the South Slavic people in Eastern Europe and the second largest city in the Soviet Union, second only to Moscow. For this reason, the German occupation of Kiev is politically important. According to historical records, Kiev has always been a base for separatist activities. For example, the German-backed Ukrainian autonomous government in 1918 was in that city for eighteen months. In addition, it is the same economically. The Ukrainian state is known as the "breadbasket of Europe," and the wheat produced is exported through Kiev.

### German Raider in the Pacific Said to Be Sunk; Location West of Panama Canal; Washington Claims No Intelligence Received

Reuters, New York, 20th – It was rumored here yesterday that "after sinking several other merchant ships in the South Pacific, a German raider has been sunk." This news originated from London but has not been confirmed. Further details are currently unavailable. According to London, the raider was sunk west of the Panama Canal. Panama and Batavia reported last week that a Dutch cargo ship en route from the Dutch East Indies to the canal was overdue and feared lost, possibly sunk by the raider. The London report did not mention the nationality of the ship that sank the raider. During yesterday's press conference, President Roosevelt declined to comment on London's claim that Britain had sunk a Nazi raider.

Reuters, Washington, 10th – The Navy Department stated yesterday that it has not received intelligence regarding the rumor that a German raider was sunk in the Pacific.

### Thailand Wishes to Maintain Friendship with All Nations; Parliament Votes Down Ban on Foreigners Entering

Reuters, Bangkok, 20th – Yesterday, the Thai Parliament voted 42 to 24 against a proposal by a member to ban foreigners from entering the country amidst the current international situation to prevent Fifth Column activities and to maintain national economic standards.

The Minister of Interior stated that the Thai government has adequate means to deal with Fifth Column activities and warned Thais not to leak state secrets.

Soviet Troops Firmly Defend Leningrad; Three Thousand Nazi Elite Killed or Wounded

Associated Press, Moscow, 20th – "Red Star" reports that the German 12th Tank Division launched a new offensive southeast of Leningrad on Wednesday, attempting to break through Soviet positions.

### Soviet Night Hawks Bomb Berlin; British Planes Attack Northern German Targets

Reuters, London, 20th – Although the German official news agency stated that British planes attacked Berlin last night, according to London sources, the British Air Force did not attack Berlin while bombing northwestern Germany. It appears that Soviet planes bombed the German capital. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that British bombers attacked dockyards, warehouses, and railway yards at Stettin, Germany's largest Baltic port, last night. Two British planes are missing. Coastal Command aircraft also bombed targets near Nantes last night, and all British planes returned safely to base. Stettin is an important supply base for German forces on the Eastern Front. The British Air Force heavily bombed the area last October, with the Politz synthetic gasoline plant as the main target. British planes must fly 600 miles to raid the area.

### Many Minor Japanese Newspapers to Cease Publication Due to Shortage of Printing Supplies

### Second Three-Year Plan Being Implemented; Actively Developing Resources; Transportation Industry to See Rapid Development; Output of Iron, Coal, and Cement Can All Be Increased

Chongqing – News from here yesterday stated that Xinjiang, China's largest and least populated province, is currently implementing its second three-year plan, actively developing its natural resources. Under the rule of pro-Soviet Governor Sheng Shicai, Xinjiang began its first three-year plan in 1937, the year the Sino-Japanese War began. Its second three-year plan began last year, coinciding with the Soviet Union's three-year plan. Achievements of the first three-year plan include the construction of 22 canals, the dredging of nine rivers, and the construction of two major reservoirs, using irrigation to reclaim 30,000 acres of wasteland. Official sources here state that after the first year of the plan concluded, 30 vehicles operated on the province's new and old highways. In the second year, another 360 drivers were trained, and 700 more transport vehicles were added, increasing transport to 4.5 million tons. When the first three-year plan was completed, 15 wireless radio stations were established, and a 700-mile long-distance telephone line was installed. In Urumqi alone, 1,000 telephones have been installed. Xinjiang's fuel oil can also be self-sufficient, with annual coal production increasing to 350,000 tons, cement production increasing to 20,000 tons per year, and iron ore production increasing to 10,000 tons per year. Undeveloped resources include gold mines near Tacheng on the border, jade in Yutian, and copper in Kuqa. In the past four years, 42 light industrial factories have been established to manufacture matches, flour, textiles, and wool products. The center of Xinjiang's light industry is Yili, where there is a university, 15 middle schools, 300 primary schools, and 122 public education centers.

The error was due to unclear telegram codes, and it is hereby corrected.

### Random Notes on the European War (8) (2) The Structure of the Stalin Line

This is also a report from the New York Times:

The Soviet Union's defense system is indeed unique. The "Stalin Line," now world-renowned, is a decentralized version of the French "Maginot Line," becoming the latest type of modern defensive fortification. The designer was Marshal Tukhachevsky, the most famous military strategist in Soviet Russia, who was unfortunately sacrificed in the 1937 purge.

Many units in this type of defensive fortification are circular, resembling wheel spokes. The Russians call them "pillboxes." Although their shapes vary, their layouts are all designed to allow shooting in all directions. One company or more often forms a triangle. Their sizes vary; some can accommodate a company, while others can accommodate a battalion. However, how these "three pillboxes" are coordinated and where troops are stationed is inconsistent. Some are independent, while others are closely connected. The purpose of connecting is to allow mutual support. Some "pillboxes," especially the larger ones, are easy to see, making it easy to lure the enemy to attack. However, once the enemy attacks, it easily falls into the fire net of many hidden "pillboxes." These hidden "pillboxes" are often disguised with mud and grass (Russians are known for their excellent camouflage), numbering in the thousands. Most "pillboxes" have tank sheds and store large quantities of gasoline, making them front-line fueling stations. If they feel difficult to defend for long, they can be blown up at any time. The amount of gasoline stored in the "pillboxes" is said to be considerable. The gasoline normally used in Soviet villages is concentrated on collective farms. In times of crisis, they transport this gasoline to specially built oil depots inside the "pillboxes," preventing even a drop from falling into the enemy's hands.

Many larger "pillboxes," especially those on the outskirts of major cities, are equipped with anti-aircraft guns that can be fired from the gun ports. Depending on their size, these "pillboxes" are also equipped with various calibers of cannons, placed in special gun positions, separated from the main body, and protected by machine guns and flamethrowers. "Pillboxes" have trenches leading outside, allowing the defenders to retreat to nearby forests.

These trenches are six feet deep and have no cover. The bottom and sides are supported by wooden blocks and special barbed wire to make them strong. When the defenders withdraw, local farmers drive disguised tractors to transport the cannons. The word "encircled" in German war reports often refers to the encirclement of these "pillboxes."

Although the "pillboxes" and trenches are simple in construction, the fortifications are extremely strong, built with the most refined steel plate and cement. They are fully equipped with electric lights and running water. The supply of running water is crucial in the Soviet Union.

The tactical role of this type of fortification is very clear, truly "absorbing the enemy like a sponge," as Soviet officers say. The Red Army uses this strategy to disconnect large enemy units, making it impossible for them to achieve their intended results. The tank vanguard responsible for breaking through the defense line is instead cut off. If they turn to attack those "pillboxes," the effectiveness of the blitzkrieg is destroyed. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the German war reports stating that their vanguard has entered enemy positions are actually effective.

The ultimate goal of this decentralized defensive fortification is to disperse the enemy's main offensive, forcing them to fight individually, and to isolate their vanguard. The Red Army uses this defense method, borrowing the operational secrets commonly used by the German General Staff, and persevering with them, ultimately preventing the German army from progressing. In other words, the Soviet defense strategy relies on the large number of their own manpower to extend the front line to disperse the enemy's forces. During the last European War, the German army launched a pincer offensive against the Imperial Russian army, capturing a large number of prisoners. However, in this war, the German army only obtained the same number of prisoners in the Polish area occupied by the Red Army, where these "pillboxes" were not built. A recent German war report stated that the Soviet Union put out sixty "arms" to deal with the German army. This bizarre military intelligence report clearly refers to the "pillbox" defenses. To date, the Soviet Union has been able to use this advantage in manpower to defend thousands of pillboxes on the one hand, while still having enough strength to form mobile units to meet the enemy at any time and in any place. They are also able to retreat slowly, avoiding large-scale mobile warfare, and luring the enemy into predetermined defensive lines to annihilate them, so that the attackers' losses are greater than the Red Army's losses when fighting and retreating. One advantage of the Red Army's "pillbox" defensive fortifications is that the enemy cannot predict the extent of man-made obstacles. Under these circumstances, forcibly crossing rivers, occupying hills, or seizing railway hubs becomes less important. In other words, the importance of natural obstacles is reduced by man-made obstacles. These man-made obstacles are no less important than fortresses. The reason why the German army has repeatedly failed to conquer Leningrad is precisely because of this.

The outside world knows little about this type of Soviet defensive fortification; even fragments of information have not been leaked out. However, the German General Staff, claiming to have mastered the inside story of the "Stalin Line," may have underestimated the strategic value of this defense line. (The End)

### International Radio Station to Broadcast Northwest Observation Team's Solar Eclipse Report; Time from 8:00 AM, Wavelength 25 Meters; Fujian and Shaanxi Observation Teams Have Departed for Their Destinations

Chongqing – On the 21st, during the solar eclipse, the International Radio Station will broadcast the spectacle of the solar eclipse from the Lintao Northwest Solar Eclipse Observation Team via the Ministry of Communications' Xianzhou Radio Station to allow listeners across the region who are unable to witness the solar eclipse to enjoy it. Scientists around the world are exploring the principles of the impact of solar eclipses on radio wave emissions. For this solar eclipse, in addition to station director Mr. Ma Dan personally going to the Northwest to observe and study the relationship between the solar eclipse and radio waves, the British Broadcasting Corporation and RCA in the United States have been contacted to test whether they can receive the station's broadcast and break through the interference of the solar eclipse. It is reported that the station's solar eclipse program will be broadcast from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM tomorrow, using a 25-meter omnidirectional wavelength. (20th)

Yongan – The total solar eclipse on the 21st will enter China from Soviet Central Asia, passing through Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other provinces, covering 112 counties and cities, a distance of 4,000 kilometers, lasting 85 minutes. The longest duration will be 3 minutes and 21 seconds in Chong'an, northern Fujian. The total eclipse zone includes 14 counties and cities, including Xining, Lintao, Tianshui, Fengxian, Qianjiang, Zhongxiang, Wuchang, Hankou, Nanchang, Shangrao, Chong'an, and Qingyuan. The last total solar eclipse visible in China was on July of the year Ji You in the Ming Jiajing Dynasty, which is August 21, 1542. The total eclipse zone was limited to the Yellow River basin. This time, in addition to the Yellow River basin, the Yangtze River basin is also included. Moreover, in China, even in places not within the total eclipse zone, the amount of the sun covered will be mostly 50% or more, truly a rare opportunity. The Fujian team organized by the China Solar Eclipse Observation Committee, with more than 60 experts, has departed from Yongan to Chong'an to work. (19th)

Baoji – The Shaanxi Provincial Solar Eclipse Observation Team, a group of more than 50 people led by Wang Jiesan, arrived in Baoji on the 19th and decided to go to Huangniupu on the 20th to conduct observations. (19th)

Mount Wuyi – In the past 399 years, there have been only two total solar eclipses visible in our country. One was on August 11, 1546, and the other was on July of the year Ji You in the Ming Jiajing Dynasty, when the solar eclipse passed through the Yellow River basin. The other one is the one on September 21 this year. It will start on the east coast of the Black Sea in the forenoon, pass through Central Asia and enter Xinjiang, traverse from northwest to southeast, and diagonally cross the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, including the provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, before entering the Pacific Ocean. The width of the total eclipse zone averages 140 kilometers, and the duration is 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The entire journey in our country is about 3,500 kilometers long, lasting 80 minutes. Academic groups, astronomical observatories, and other institutions in the country cherish this once-in-a-millennium opportunity and have organized observation teams to conduct observations in Gansu and Fujian provinces. The focus of observation will be placed on Mount Wuyi in the east. Mount Wuyi is one of China's famous mountains, where the Song Dynasty Confucian Zhu Xi lectured. It is known for its tea production. It is located in Chong'an County on the northern border of Fujian Province and is the best observation location in the southeast this time. The Fujian Provincial Meteorological Bureau organized an observation committee half a year ago to prepare and sent personnel to Chongqing to liaise with relevant central agencies and national universities in advance. Currently, there are more than 30 units from academic groups and institutions participating in the observation from within and outside the province, including the Chinese Astronomical Society, the Bureau of Land Surveying, the Astronomical Observatory, the Fujian Provincial Meteorological Bureau, the Geological Survey Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Zhongshan University, Xiamen University, Zhejiang University, the Fuzhou branch of the Central News Agency, the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, the Audiovisual Education Office, and the Provincial Radio Station. Among them, there are five main observation teams with more than 60 experts, each carrying and transporting instruments and taking on more than 20 tasks, including (the beginning and end times of the solar eclipse), (solar eclipse photography), (changes in the high-altitude electron layer), (geomagnetic changes), and (telegraph changes). Hundreds of spectators have come from afar from Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other places. This grand event on a famous mountain is unprecedented and will surely contribute to astronomy in our country. (20th)

### Sino-Burmese Immigration Negotiations Have Begun

Rangoon – When Sino-Burmese negotiations on the issue of Chinese immigrants to Burma began yesterday, the chief Chinese representative Hui Rongfu was absent due to illness. His opening speech was read by another person, emphasizing the mutually interdependent relationship between China and Burma and stating that China and Burma are on the side of the democratic front. The recent remarks by British Prime Minister Churchill have indicated his awareness that Japan's southward advance in the Pacific is a real danger. Today's negotiations are another demonstration of cooperation between China and Burma. The Burmese Prime Minister rose to speak, saying that although Burma's proposals seek to limit the entry of new Chinese immigrants, there is absolutely no intention to impose unfair or insulting conditions on Chinese immigrants. Burma also intends to treat Chinese people already in Burma generously. Burma has benefited greatly from Chinese immigrants in the past, and it is necessary to maintain harmony between China and Burma at any cost. The best way to achieve this goal is to implement mutually agreed restrictions on Chinese immigrants, thereby dispelling the natural fears of the Burmese people. (Reuters, 20th)

### Ministry of Finance: Reorganizing Salt Tax

Chongqing: The reorganization of salt taxes has been under discussion for a long time. The authorities, considering that salt will soon be a government monopoly, do not wish to make many changes. Therefore, they are only adopting a system of ad valorem taxation. All regular and additional taxes other than production and sales taxes, such as construction special funds, additional tax reorganization fees, and public welfare fees, will be abolished. Hereafter, production taxes will be collected at the production site, and sales taxes will be levied on the cost of salt at a rate of 10% when it arrives at the sales location, with absolutely no double taxation. The tax for industrial salt remains at one yuan per dan (unit of weight). The new method will be implemented this month. The average monthly revenue is expected to be 50 million yuan, doubling the previous amount. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

### Wang and Xu Win the Right to the Finals in the Grass Court Tennis All-Grades Singles - Wang Wenzheng Eliminates Tang Baojia in Straight Sets - Xu Chengwei Wins Li Guofan After a Hard-Fought Five-Set Match

In this year's Grass Court Senior Singles semi-finals, the four knights of the Chinese tennis world, Wang Wenzheng, Xu Chengwei, Li Guofan, and Tang Xianjia, met at the Association's tennis court yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to compete for the right to the finals. Given the miracle of a Chinese takeover, the number of spectators reached thousands, with domestic fans accounting for the vast majority, creating an unprecedented scene. As a result of the semi-finals, Wang Wenzheng eliminated Tang Baojia in straight sets, while Xu Chengwei eliminated Li Guofan after a hard-fought five-set match, turning defeat into victory. The match between Xu and Li was full of surprises and was quite exciting. Wang and Xu will meet in the finals at a later date. The results of yesterday's semi-finals are as follows:

Two Sets of Performances

In the match between Wang and Tang, Tang Baojia had little power to resist under the one-sided situation. Regardless of smashes or volleys, Wang Wenzheng could move at will. If Wang had not shown mercy, Tang would have been completely defeated. Xu Chengwei and Li Guofan both arrived late and did not start until 4:30 PM. The strength of the two was almost indistinguishable, and the victory or defeat depended on luck. In terms of technique, Li Guofan seemed to be slightly better, but it was a pity that he suffered defeat due to chaos and instability in a winnable situation. After a hard-fought battle that lasted two hours, both were exhausted. Xu's serve was not as good as Li's, but his backhand was Xu's masterpiece, showing the style of his older brother Xu Chengji. His diagonal draws with both forehands and backhands were also wonderfully executed, but his ball-striking skills were still immature. Li Guofan's serve had the style of Lin Baohua, powerful and deep into the corner. It was a pity that Li lost many points on his serve, resulting in a reversal of fortune.

Highlights of the Fierce Battle In the match between Wang and Tang, Wang completed five games in one breath in the first set, and Tang only won one game before Wang easily won with a score of six to one. In the second set, Wang still took the lead with five consecutive games, then released one game, and won again with a score of six to one. In the third set, Tang broke Wang Wenzheng's serve and won the first game, but then suffered a major setback, losing six consecutive games. The score was again six to one. In summary, Wang won in straight sets. Following this, Xu and Li fought. Li Guofan showed maturity and physical strength, both with the upper hand. It was a pity that Li had a two-to-one lead, and in the fourth set, he trailed by one to five, and caught up to five to five, but he failed to achieve complete success in the end. Xu then made it seven to five, tying the score at two sets each, which was a pity. In the fifth and final set, the linesman misjudged a good ball as out of bounds, losing the game point. Otherwise, it would have been five-all, so victory or defeat was really a matter of luck. Li Guofan completely dominated in the first, second, and third sets. In the fourth set, the situation relaxed, and Xu took the lead with a score of five to one. Although Li chased and tied it to five each, it was a pity that he could not achieve complete success. In the final decisive set, after Li led by three to two, Xu won three consecutive games, and won by six to four.

### Cai Guoheng and Averig Will Compete - Junior Singles Champion - Parker Cup Doubles Final Cancelled

The International Parker Cup Doubles Tournament, originally scheduled to decide this year's champion at the Association's court this afternoon, was canceled due to the French Municipal Council Police Department's ban on competitions in the French Concession. The final of the Men's Junior Singles Championship was also decided to be postponed. The semi-finals of this tournament were held a few days ago. Up-and-coming player Cai Guoheng defeated Auguste in straight sets, and Kuang Tianhan lost to Averig by three to one. The final between Cai Guoheng and Averig is expected to be a one-sided situation, as Cai is actually a Group A player, only slightly less experienced than Li Guofan and Tang Baojia. Averig, on the other hand, is a second-rate player from French business, with mediocre strength. The results of the Junior Singles and Men's Doubles are recorded as follows. The All-Shanghai Xiangqi Charity Tournament opens today.

### All-Shanghai Xiangqi Charity Tournament Opens Today - Xiafeng vs. Customs Today

### Yarn and Cotton Flowers - All Because of the Influx of Hot Money - Cotton Yarn Buying is Booming

The yarn market continues to be good, and the price increases are ongoing. At the same time, the sales of spot yarn have improved significantly. The Hong Kong merchants have a slightly stronger demand for the 20-count medium and low-grade yarns, buying about 300 bales. There is no appetite for other 32-count and 42-count yarns. Therefore, people's sentiment is good, and the bulls are further adding to the momentum. However, because there are very few factory orders, the market is not very prosperous. However, some people are bullish because of raw materials and expect prices to rise. However, if prices rise, there will be no shortage of short sellers. In this regard, the lineup of both bulls and bears is quite solid. The highest price for Double Horse 20-count yarn was 1,758 yuan, the lowest price was 1,745 yuan, and the closing price was 1,713 yuan. However, after the market closed, rumors suddenly came about, and sellers gathered, saying that it was doing at 1,745 or 1,746 yuan. The current situation in the yarn market looks good in terms of common sense, but judging from past trends, it is often the opposite.

Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the upward momentum from the previous day, with the first lot priced at 1,750 yuan. As soon as this lot opened, the atmosphere on the trading floor was lively, and buying was booming. The so-called "table top" caused a scramble to enter, and it soon rose to 1,757 yuan. Shortly after, it was heard that the Exchange opened high, and the second lot was soft, and people's sentiment eased slightly, falling to 1,746 yuan. However, the spot yarn purchases by Guangdong merchants were not weak, and it rose again to 1,758 yuan. Subsequently, a slightly larger amount of large households released, and the market was slightly soft, and it was tired to 1,753 yuan at the close. According to statistics, 8,840 bales were traded in half a day. On the 21st, 280 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 300 South Seas 40

Fellow merchants 8,500 Total 8,840

The Jin Double Horse futures market is slowly soaring, and the ground is relatively stable. Although US cotton continues to decline strongly, and general buyers are quite willing to absorb it in this dull atmosphere, and are not willing to wait for a long time, coupled with the influx of hot money. Furthermore, it is said that the sales of spot yarn have not moved, so factory orders are firm as soon as they open. Furthermore, due to the influence of large households, the market is standing firm. The human sentiment of the future yarn should be glowing, especially since the trading this month is about to be delivered. With the multi-party pull, the short sellers have to buy back, so the market price rises. The September contract opened at a high price of 1,668 yuan, the October contract opened at 1,674 yuan, and the November contract opened at 1,683 yuan. The initial opening transaction was circuitous and varied. In the middle, the Exchange was firm and then soft again. The recent meeting rolled slightly to 1,664 yuan, the October contract fell to 1,669 yuan, and the November contract also fell to 1,681 yuan. Until the close, the bulls came to purchase again, so the prices went up two to four yuan. As a result, the recent contract closed at 1,668 yuan, rising six yuan, the October contract was 1,672 yuan, also rising four yuan, and the November contract was at 1,682 yuan, rising two yuan. The transaction price list is listed below:

### Foreign Cotton Continues to Fall - Spot Cotton Buyers Lack Enthusiasm

The spot cotton situation is slightly mediocre, and the trading is not as enthusiastic as the previous day. This is because the foreign cotton is falling rapidly, and the yarn market has no big hopes. Although the speculative mentality is to always look up, the real spot buyers lack enthusiasm.

The New York cotton market first fell due to negative news from the Soviet Union and weakness in New Orleans. Then, it rebounded slightly due to short covering. Yesterday's closing price was about 27 or 28 points lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market first fell due to cotton merchants selling a large number of long positions. However, it rose slightly later due to some profit-taking buying. Yesterday's closing prices fell by about four rupees. It is also predicted that the opening market today will continue to be small by 2.75 rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trading is undoubtedly because overseas direct cotton setting, there is no development at present. All parties can only recruit for spot cotton.

### Finance - Cash Fluctuates Without Stability

Yesterday's gold market was dismal. The October contract delivery trading opened at one hundred and several tens of taels. The market trend turned from strong to weak. It went out and in the 6,900 yuan level, only 15 yuan high and low, and finally rolled slightly for five yuan. Cash, on the other hand, was fluctuating uncertainly, first rising and then returning. A certain bank once again supplied purchases, and the securities brokers tried their best to sell, causing it to break through 9,100 yuan and then immediately return. From the morning opening, the price was the same as the last price of the previous day. The gold shops did each other 20 taels, at 9,070 yuan. A certain bank received the money, and Xianghe entered a small money shop for 30 taels, rising to 9,080 yuan. Suddenly, Taikangrun, Yongfengyu and other cash shops started to spit out, slightly seeing the market falling. A Shanghai west merchant entered a certain cash shop for 20 taels at 9,065 yuan. Unexpectedly, Xianghe supplied more bravely, and after raising it to 9,100 yuan, there were fewer sellers, and the price continued to rise to 9,160 yuan. At the beginning, Defu supplied ten taels, followed by continuous sales. At that time, the enterers were waiting and watching, so it was also shouted down to within 9,100 yuan. A bill merchant sold ten taels to a gold shop for 9,080 yuan. Suddenly, the bank helped to do 20 taels with each other and raised it to 9,100 yuan. In the end, Defu shouted 9,090 yuan for sale, and at that time, there were few responders. The price was 20 yuan higher than the previous day's closing. There was a high and low of 95 yuan. The number of transactions was five hundred and several tens of taels. The retail price of the cash shop's main brand gold was 9,150 yuan. The purchase price was 200 yuan lower than the selling price. Jewelry gold first rose by ten yuan, and then returned to the same level.

Futures Sparsely Non-Existent

### Sugar and Woolen Foreign Exchange - Under Discussion

The foreign exchange market yesterday, the central and HSBC both listed prices were flat, and the HSBC small counter price was also fixed. Overseas Chinese businessmen in the black market were willing to sell US exchange rate of 5.125, but it was difficult to get a counterpart. The general importers who were not allowed to apply were also not responding to 4.75, so the price was still 4.75, English exchange 28125. It is heard that the Stabilisation Fund will also be calculating the supply and settlement of foreign exchange for woolen cloth, sugar and other general legitimate importers, which is under discussion. It is also heard that importers who are not allowed to apply are contacting foreign merchants. It is said that they will buy goods with US dollars in the future.

### Chongqing and Shanghai Compare Term Deposits - Facilitates the Transfer of Hot Money

The Sichuan Gang banks in this city have recently handled Chongqing-compared term deposits, with no restrictions on the number of deposits, but each household must have at least 1,000 yuan of Chongqing currency, and the term is specified for half a month, with the middle and end of each month as the deposit and withdrawal dates. If you want to deposit before the term, it can also be accommodated, but it must still be interest-bearing from the middle or end of the month, so that Chongqing can deposit and withdraw. Deposit interest rates are based on the Chongqing comparison interest rate for each period, and are set once every half month (the previous period this year was around 2 points per month), and the deposits are calculated in Chongqing's general national currency. Shanghai deposits are converted according to the exchange rate from Shanghai to Chongqing on that day (for example, if you deposit more than 700 yuan of national currency in Shanghai now, you can get 1,000 yuan of Chongqing national currency). If you want to withdraw part or all of the principal and interest on the due date, it will be converted into Shanghai currency according to the exchange rate from Chongqing to Shanghai on that day. If you want to withdraw it in Chongqing or a city other than Chongqing, you can also open a draft.

### Securities - Domestic Debt Slightly Down

The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was done in the morning. It started at eleven o'clock. Category C was first opened at 72.2 corners, but for a time, the selling was extremely active, breaking two yuan and seeing a low price of 1.6 corners. The reason was that there was also an issue of 120 million military public bonds, and the bulls were discouraged and the front line was broken through. The environment has also become a negative one, but the bulls may not be willing to stop immediately. Yesterday, Kai Panji Ji Lianyi 90% Yitai bought in, while the sellers like Renfeng Dazhong Dahua Xinfeng Huachang bravely sold, which made the market go down in a straight line. Although Runde Sheng Dahong Daxinfu still had needs, and Le Mao still had a large number of sales, Ding Kang Shuntai Lianhe also had a steady supply, which caused the close to only Category C and E to slightly recover, and all other types were still tired and unable to rise. As a result, the market price uniformly returned to small four corners and a half to seven corners. The total number of transactions was 1.56 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### Grain Prices: Foreign Rice Initially Rises, Then Falls

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice initially rose and then fell. The final result was a slight drop, nearing one yuan. This was because the morning market inherited the bullish trend from the previous night, and everyone expected prices to continue rising. Indeed, retail sales were strong, especially for weekend purchases. Furthermore, buyers from Hangzhou and other inland Zhejiang areas came to the market to purchase broken rice and various grades of rice from Zhongguan. Market sentiment was extremely strong, and the prices of all types of rice rose uniformly. Xiaowen current rice reached 107 yuan, Saigon No. 1 reached 119 yuan, No. 2 reached 110 yuan, and other types of rice all rose in unison. The Xiaojiao Yinhua Company also opened at 134.5 yuan, an increase of more than one yuan compared to the closing price of the previous night. However, after the rise, there was profit-taking, and due to unfavorable rumors, retail investors actively sold at the high prices, causing the market to fall sharply. Bank godowns and Xiaojiao immediately fell from 106.5 yuan to 105.5 yuan, and Yinhua Company also fell by half a yuan, with other types of rice following suit. As a result, prices fell by about one yuan compared to the previous night. Transaction volume still reached 14,000 to 15,000 bags, with Yinhua Company trading 300 to 400 tons.

The market for thick and thin japonica domestic rice has a limited daily supply due to inconvenient transportation. Sales are mainly to local shops to meet actual demand, and the market is more grounded and predictable, unlike foreign rice, which fluctuates wildly. Yesterday, as foreign rice prices showed strength in the morning, people's expectations also became unusually firm. Both new and old japonica rice sold briskly, with prices rising by two to three yuan. Specifically, new rice from Nanhui opened at 153 yuan, and old rice at 150 yuan. New japonica rice from Pudong was priced as high as 153.5 yuan, and then at 150.05 yuan. As for thick broken japonica rice from Wuxi, sales were relatively slow due to slightly larger arrivals, and no transactions were reported.

The glutinous rice market still has ample supply and inventory, and sellers' sentiment is quite firm. Retail sales to food stalls and cake shops are also quite brisk. Consequently, the price of glutinous rice has increased by one yuan amidst the high prices of other goods. Hong Kong special white glutinous rice sold for 128-129 yuan, high-grade glutinous rice for 127 yuan, then 123 yuan, and glutinous tea rice for 114.5-114 yuan.

Another shipment of Saigon corn arrived. The French company 列康特里勒号 arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening, bringing 9,773 bags of yellow bagged corn from Saigon, and was berthed at buoys 11 and 12 for unloading and transshipment. (Group)

### Local Merchants Continue to Actively Purchase Vermicelli

Yesterday morning, the vermicelli market showed considerable activity due to the bullish sentiment from the previous day. Local merchants were actively purchasing vermicelli in response to the rising prices, and weekend retail sales were also good. Additionally, there were inquiries about exporting existing vermicelli stock, and new orders had not yet been finalized, leading to upward market sentiment and gradually rising prices. Jinlong vermicelli from West Godown rose from 30.07 yuan to 30.08 yuan, East Godown vermicelli to 31.55 yuan, and Paotai vermicelli from 32.665 yuan to 32.7 yuan. Banana vermicelli was priced at 22.5 yuan, all increasing by two to three yuan compared to the previous market price. However, by the afternoon, the number of buyers suddenly decreased, and those seeking to profit from the price increase were unable to sell out completely. The market quickly turned sluggish. In the afternoon market, West Godown vermicelli was initially sold at 31.75 yuan, but later there were few buyers even at 30.06 yuan. Transaction volume was less than 10,000 bags. However, the supply of wheat was low, and the market remained strong.

### Oil Market: News of Continued Oil Arrivals in Shanghai; Oil Merchants Remain Silent

The edible oil market has been sluggish recently due to the surge in supply and slow sales. News has emerged that large quantities are still arriving from Tianjin and Qingdao, and that Dalian oil is also expected to arrive in Shanghai. This has caused oil merchants to remain silent, afraid to engage in speculation. Other speculative groups involved in yarn, cotton, and rice have also expressed their inability to influence the market. Consequently, the market has lacked support and has continued to decline. Yesterday, the prices of various oils fell by two to five yuan compared to the previous day. Sales included over 200 barrels of raw Qingdao oil and soybean oil, over 8,000 piculs of Daya Factory refined oil, and around 5,000 barrels of Rihua Factory vegetable oil. Lide and Yoshida factories each sold 100 barrels of vegetable oil. (Detailed prices are in the market price section)

### Textiles: Autumn Sales Progress

Factory Cloth: The market rose slightly yesterday as rumors subsided and interest from traders and hoarders increased. Retail sales by local merchants also progressed due to seasonal demand, leading to a uniform increase in cloth prices. White cloth, both coarse and fine, and twill cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. Dyed cloth increased by about 0.5 yuan in some cases. Transaction volume decreased due to Saturday. Approximately 100 pieces of coarse cloth were purchased by the Zhejiang-East Textile Merchant Guild, and 40-50 pieces by other groups. The Guangdong-Hong Kong and Nanyang Merchant Guild purchased 200-300 pieces of coarse cloth, twill cloth, and dyed cloth. On the 21st, three pieces of textile were shipped to Singapore, and 360 pieces to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: The Shanghai Cloth Exchange's leading futures contract rose steadily as short sellers covered their positions. The current month's contract rose by 0.6 yuan, and the contracts for October to December rose by 0.25 to 0.39 yuan. In the spot market, the price also rose by 0.2 yuan. Fine cloth from the leading mill for the new contract closed at 59.1 yuan, and the old contract at 57.9 yuan. Dyed "Four Gentlemen" serge, new contract with new tax, was priced at 1.2375 yuan per yard, and the old contract at 1.165 yuan, also rising by 0.005 to 0.0075 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Rainproof Cloth Sales Are Brisk

Rainproof Cloth: Currently, there is brisk sales to Western-style clothing manufacturers, and the demand from merchants in this city is stronger than before. This is because the quality and appearance of these cloths, in various shades of color, are similar to imported fabrics. While imported fabrics sell for around 40 yuan per yard, the rainproof cloth only sells for around 6-7 yuan. Jin Xiong brand rainproof cloth has been on the market for a long time and is in high demand. As a result, companies such as Rentai, Yinbian, and Shuanglu have recently increased production significantly, and their prices are a few cents cheaper per yard than Yousheng. However, buyers still prefer the Jin Xiong brand. Yesterday, Rentai's Renyuan Taishan and Yin Xinji brands were sold at 6.5 yuan, and Yousheng's Jin Xiong brand was sold at 6.9 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Coarse Sand is Firm; Dutch Red is Weak

Yesterday, there was a telegram from Holland regarding sugar. Coarse sand for shipment in October and November was priced at US$7.35 CIF & KG. As a result, the price of coarse sand in Shanghai was very firm. The company's futures contract for the end of the month opened at 135.3 yuan to 134.8 yuan, and closed at 135 yuan, up 0.2 yuan. The contract for October 10 opened at 136.3 yuan to 135.9 yuan, and closed at 136.3 yuan, up 0.4 yuan. The spot market for delivery in September was priced at 136 yuan to 135.8 yuan, August at 135.4 yuan to 135.5 yuan, July at 135 yuan to 134.8 yuan, and June at 134.4 yuan, with increases similar to those in the futures market. Taikoo White DY mark was priced at 144 yuan, HX mark at 138 yuan, down 0.5 yuan. H mark coarse red was priced at 114 yuan, and Dutch Red at 123.5 yuan to 122.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan. Transaction volume was not strong due to the weekend, totaling over 27,000 bags.

### Seafood: Continued Arrivals of Sea Shrimp

There have been continuous arrivals of sea shrimp recently, and sales are still active. Medium-sized sea shrimp are currently selling for 378 yuan to 385 yuan, and Du Hua shrimp for 465 yuan to 490 yuan, with prices remaining stable.

### Cork Oak (1)

— Gao Jiannong

The cork oak is a type of tree belonging to the Quercus genus of the Fagaceae family. One type grows in China, distributed in Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces. It is a deciduous tree, growing up to 25 meters tall. The type that grows along the Mediterranean coast, in countries like Spain, Portugal, southern France, Italy, Sicily, and Algeria, is an evergreen tree, growing up to 20 meters tall, but usually only 6-7 meters. The two types are very similar in appearance; their leaves are alternate, oblong-shaped, with short petioles, thick texture, serrated edges, and dense white or grayish-white soft hairs on the underside. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers on the same tree: male flowers are arranged in long, drooping spikes; female flowers grow in the leaf axils or at the ends of branches, in capitate inflorescences that stand erect. The fruit is an acorn, with a bowl-shaped cupule at the base.

Currently, Spain and Portugal are the largest producers of cork, supplying over half of the world's needs. Therefore, the Mediterranean cork oak has attracted our attention and interest. Everything described below refers to it.

From birth to the age of five or six, the outer bark of the cork oak is smooth. Afterwards, it slowly begins to crack. These cracks can be very deep in older trees, sometimes reaching 30 centimeters (one Chinese foot). This layer of outer bark is absolutely not suitable for use as cork as we commonly know it. Europeans call it "male cork." It is necessary to peel off this layer of male outer bark, and then the fine, soft, and elastic "female cork" can grow underneath.

In reality, all oaks, botanical plants, can produce cork; that is, they can all utilize their cambium layer, producing parenchyma tissue inward and phellem tissue outward, which is cork. Therefore, cork is simply some dead tissue. However, in flexible oak plants, this cork extends very deep into the wood, and there is no fixed location; this results in alternating layers of wood and cork, which we cannot utilize at all. As for the "cork oak," its cambium layer is always outside the wood and does not migrate. Although initially hard and soft cork layers alternate in production—this layer separation can sometimes be seen very clearly on a bottle stopper—after the age of ten, its cork-producing function gets on track, and from then on it simply produces cork step by step.

The procedure of removing the outer bark (female cork) for the first time can only be done when the tree is fifteen years old, at which point the circumference of the trunk is probably 30 centimeters. People use an ax or saw to make two types of cuts on the trunk: one that goes around the trunk, and one that goes straight up and down. Then, using the duck-billed ax handle, they pry open and remove the bark, which is shaped like a "cannon barrel." From then on, the tree's cambium layer slowly produces the fine cork. However, it is always necessary to wait ten or fifteen years—depending entirely on the environment in which the tree is located—for the cork to grow to a thickness of around three centimeters, at which point it can be harvested in the manner described earlier. However, whether removing the outer bark or harvesting the cork, one should never strip the tree completely bare, leaving it exposed to the elements, which can cause injury or death. A Frenchman named Capgrand Mothe was the first to have a great sense of compassion, fearing that the cork oak would be embarrassed by having its "pants" removed, and thought to put a coat on it; that is, to wrap the tree with rags or worthless male cork that had been peeled off. As a result, the cork obtained was finer and had fewer gaps. To clarify: removing the outer bark or harvesting the cork is generally done in the month from June 15th to July 15th; trees from 50 to 150 years old produce the best quality cork. (To be continued)

### Shanghai This Afternoon at 1:30 PM: The Rare Phenomenon of a Partial Solar Eclipse Will Be Visible; 92% of the Sun Will Be Obscured; Cloudy Skies Will Affect Observation

Today, Shanghai and the central part of China will be able to witness the first total solar eclipse in 400 years. This total solar eclipse will first appear around 12 noon in Soviet Central Asia. Twenty-seven minutes later, it will enter Chinese territory from Xinjiang, moving southeast through Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and exiting through northern Fujian at 1:30 PM. Around 3 PM, it will end northeast of Taiwan. At that point, the moon's shadow will bid farewell to the Earth. The total time spent within China is approximately 80 minutes, covering a distance of approximately 2,350 kilometers. In terms of the duration of the total solar eclipse visible in various locations, northern Fujian will have the longest duration at 2 minutes and 21 seconds. However, the current weather conditions in southeastern China are highly unfavorable, making it difficult to obtain satisfactory results in Fujian. The observation sites in Gansu and Russia appear to be the most convenient. The average width of the total eclipse is approximately 135 kilometers. What is visible in Shanghai will only be a partial eclipse. At 1:30 PM (new time), 92% of the sun's surface will be obscured by the moon's shadow.

If the weather is clear today, it will suddenly turn dark, as if it were nighttime. Because solar eclipses are rare and are related to various astronomical and scientific knowledge, astronomers from various countries have formed teams to go to suitable locations for observation in order to collect solid materials. For ordinary people who wish to observe with the naked eye, the simplest method is to use ordinary glasses fitted with black lenses, such as those used by sailors for sextants. Glasses that have been partially or completely smoked black can also be used for observation. However, whether there will be changes in the weather today is a major concern for those observing the eclipse, because if the sky is covered by clouds, it will inevitably affect the observation of the eclipse and cause various difficulties. According to the meteorological reports from various locations reported by the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday, it was raining in the sky over Hankou, while it was clear in Nanjing. The average atmospheric pressure in Shanghai is not very low, but it is still difficult to determine whether there will be changes in the weather today.

Observation Times

According to experts, the predicted time for the first contact (when the edges of the sun and moon first touch) in Shanghai is 1:09 PM, the time of maximum eclipse (i.e., the greatest partial eclipse) is 1:30 PM, and the time of restoration (when the sun completely emerges from the moon's shadow) is 2:04 PM. The area in China where the total solar eclipse is visible covers approximately 116 counties in eight provinces. In the above areas, the longest duration of the total solar eclipse, from totality (when the sun is completely obscured) to reappearance (when the sun first emerges from the moon's shadow), is 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

A Fortunate Opportunity

This total eclipse is truly a rare celestial phenomenon that occurs only once every few centuries. Assuming that China's area accounts for two-fiftieths of the globe, the opportunity for the center of the total eclipse belt to fall in China occurs only once every century. In terms of time and location, being visible at noon in the densely populated areas along the Yellow River and Yangtze River, in the past 500 years, apart from one occurrence in the Yellow River basin in July of the 21st year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty (1542), today is the second time. The distance between the two occurrences is four centuries. Therefore, our ability to witness a total solar eclipse today is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Breaking Superstition

The Shanghai YMCA invited Mr. Xu Lu, the director of the Engineering Department of Zhijiang University, to give a lecture on solar eclipses, which was held at the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao yesterday afternoon at 4 PM. The lecture, entitled "The Principles of Solar Eclipses and Methods of Observation," recounted that solar eclipses are not strange events, and have been discovered countless times since history began. However, superstitious ideas prevailed in ancient times. Now that science is flourishing, the time of a solar eclipse can be calculated in advance. This total eclipse is truly a once-in-a-century opportunity. The principles of solar eclipses were repeatedly emphasized and explained in detail.

A Brilliant Spectacle

According to Xu's lecture, in the moment before the solar eclipse, the moon's black shadow gradually approaches and merges with the sun from west to east. At this time, the moon becomes a black shadow, which proves that the moon itself cannot emit light. A chromosphere is seen around the circumference of the two intersecting celestial bodies (sun and moon), emitting intense flames. According to records, these flames reach tens of thousands of miles in height. Sunspots are where these flames erupt. During the total eclipse, the observed flames have different shapes and colors, some resembling orchid leaves, some resembling fountains, and some resembling eruptions. The largest flames, furthest from the eruption point, are approximately several million miles long. There is also strong radiation emitting from the flames, creating a magnificent and spectacular sight.

### How to Observe a Total Solar Eclipse

— Written by Priest Mao Ruoxu, Director of the Xujiahui Observatory

Yesterday afternoon, a reporter drove to Xujiahui to visit Priest Xu Runnong, who introduced him to Priest Mao Ruoxu (Lepere K. Dumas, S.J.), the acting director of the Observatory. Priest Mao is a renowned astronomer, famous throughout the world. He specially published an article in Shen Bao on the day of the total eclipse, explaining the best locations to observe the solar eclipse, which has scientific value. As for the essay on this total eclipse, it will be published in the Chinese National Magazine (La Revue National Chinoise) in October, which those concerned about solar eclipses should definitely read. Translator's Note

The total eclipse of September 21, 1941, provides observers of solar eclipses with a good opportunity to choose an observation location, because the area traversed by the total eclipse's shadow is very wide, approximately 7,000 kilometers or more. The entire duration of the eclipse is seven minutes and forty seconds, which is not extremely long, but is sufficient for observation, while the duration of totality is two hundred and two seconds. The eclipse's path travels from northwest to southeast, dividing the Asian continent into two parts, passing through various different regions, including plateaus, deserts, river areas, hilly areas, and finally the southeastern coast of China. The eclipse begins at sunrise in the North Caucasus, and its shadow gradually progresses through the Caspian Sea and Soviet Central Asia, before entering Chinese territory from the northwest, crossing the heart of the country, dividing the entire territory into two parts, and then leaving Chinese territory and disappearing into the Pacific Ocean.

The path of the total eclipse—its progress through China—is explained in detail in the attached map. It enters Xinjiang Province at 8:37 AM (Xinjiang time). The average width of the total eclipse belt is approximately 130 kilometers. After that, it takes only 80 minutes to sweep across China in a southeasterly direction, covering a distance of 4,000 kilometers.

The areas through which the solar eclipse's shadow passes are as follows: the Tianshan Mountains and the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang Province, the northern Tarim Basin, northern Qinghai Province, southern Gansu Province, southern Shaanxi Province, all of Hubei Province, a small part of southern Zhejiang Province, and northern Fujian Province. There are also many famous cities within the shadow area, such as Kuqa and Luntai in Xinjiang Province, Lintao and Tianshui in Gansu Province, with the provincial capital Lanzhou just outside the shadow area, Fengxian and Ankang in Shaanxi Province, Baokang and Xianning in Hubei Province, as well as the three towns of Wuhan, Jiujiang and Yongxiu in Jiangxi Province, as well as the provincial capital Nanchang, Pucheng, Jianyang, and Fuan in Fujian Province, as well as other famous cities that are not listed here. The total eclipse belt passes through the most densely populated parts of mainland China, crossing many highways and seven important railway lines, including the Longhai Railway, the Pinghan Railway, the Yuehan Railway, the Nanchang-Hunan Railway, the entire Nansun Railway, the Nanjing-Nanchang Railway, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It also crosses the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province.

Reports indicate that the Chinese government has dispatched two observation teams to Fujian and Gansu to record the phenomena of the solar eclipse. In the near future, we will surely receive good reports.

### Further Extension of the Deadline for Goods Stored in Customs Warehouses

Regarding imported goods stored in customs warehouses, the Jianghai Customs has issued another notice extending the storage deadline. It is now known that the Customs believes that the situation has not yet become peaceful, and therefore has extended the deadline for imported goods stored in customs warehouses again until the end of this year. This measure has a significant impact on commodity prices, and it is hoped that there will be no further extensions in the future, so as to avoid fueling speculation.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Announces Flood Prevention Plan: Raising Ground Level Along the River in the Central and Northern Districts; Installing Valves on All Underground Sewers; Building a Large New Ditch and Installing Pumps in the Western District

According to an announcement by the Municipal Council, the Public Works Department has recognized that waterlogging has frequently plagued the Settlement in recent years, causing significant impact. Therefore, a plan has been drafted to mitigate most of the flooding caused by factors beyond the Council's control. According to this plan, the ground level along the river in the central and northern districts of the Settlement will be raised to prevent the intrusion of extremely high tides. All underground sewers will be equipped with a type of valve, and pumps will be installed at some sewer outlets to drain rainwater during high tides. The western district of Shanghai, which is five times the size of the central district, is most prone to waterlogging during heavy rains. Therefore, similar measures as in other districts will be taken, including installing the same type of valves on underground sewers, burying a large new ditch that is eight feet deep and twelve feet wide, and installing a pump on top of the new ditch to drain approximately 1.5 million gallons of accumulated water per day. The eastern district has very little water accumulation, so fewer defensive measures are needed. The aforementioned plan was approved by the Council at its regular meeting on the 17th of this month, with an estimated cost of around 4 million yuan. It is planned to allocate one-tenth of the funds this year, and the flood prevention project is planned to be initiated quickly, with the goal of completing most of it before the start of the flood season next year.

Mr. Gimson's Great Efforts

This summer, the city has repeatedly experienced flooding, and citizens have criticized the authorities for neglecting flood prevention. However, the public is unaware that Mr. Gimson, the Director of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, has been quietly drafting a plan, overcoming various difficulties related to the details, and has finally devised a solution to the Shanghai flooding problem. It is said that the Public Works Department completed its plan after conducting various experiments, and submitted it to the Council in the form of concrete and specific recommendations. As for the implementation of this plan, it is not yet known exactly how long it will take to complete. However, qualified sources say that the duration should not exceed two years. Considering the magnitude of the project, the two-year period cannot be considered long. Shanghai has suffered from flooding since time immemorial due to its low-lying terrain. Whenever there is torrential rain, even if it only lasts for a few hours, the central district, especially the areas on the outer roads of the Settlement, are invariably plagued by water accumulation.

Preventing Flooding is Beneficial to Shanghai

The damages suffered by Shanghai as a result of this have not been accurately quantified, but it is estimated to be over one million yuan annually. From an agricultural point of view, vegetable growers have been disappointed in Shanghai, so almost all of the vegetables needed by the city are supplied from other cities. The repeated flooding of the central commercial district of the Public Settlement and the major thoroughfares of the French Concession has also caused great inconvenience to the citizens. Flooding has been particularly severe in recent years, so the criticism directed at the authorities has been more intense than in previous years. Qualified sources believe that completely preventing flooding is a huge project that the Municipal Council cannot undertake. Even if it were possible, the Council would have difficulty raising the huge amount of funding required. However, any plan that can improve the flooding situation is beneficial to the city.

Dredging the Huangpu River Cannot Be Neglected

The English-language "China Press" stated that the Municipal Council has approved the flood prevention plan proposed by Mr. Gimson, the Director of the Public Works Department of the Council, and has decided to allocate 4 million yuan to implement it. Taxpayers in the Public Settlement fear that taxes will be increased again. Some people have stated that the Council should make a greater effort to restore the dredging work around Shanghai by the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, as this would be the best strategy. The most important reason for flooding in Shanghai is the lack of dredging of the Huangpu River and the various creeks connecting to the city since the outbreak of the war in 1937. Unless the dredging work is restored, the plan that the Municipal Council intends to implement is bound to fail, and will only cause taxpayers to bear unnecessary burdens. The reporter recently asked a spokesperson for the Municipal Council about these points. According to the response, the flood prevention plan will not fail.

### Eliminating Remaining Black Market Foreign Exchange; US Dollar Notes Must Have Restricted Circulation; Following the Example of British Gold Pound Notes

The recently published "Millard's Review" contained an article by A. B. Aaleson, stating that since the Exchange Equalization Fund has been managing the foreign exchange market, there are still remnants of the black market for foreign exchange in the city. The reasons for this are no more than three: (1) US dollar notes can still be freely bought and sold in Shanghai. The price of each US dollar actually exceeds the statutory exchange rate of the Exchange Equalization Fund by more than two yuan. All banks can generally accept and pay with them, unlike British gold pound notes, which British banks generally refuse to accept and pay with, except for special reasons. (2) The foreign exchange provided before the democratic countries' banks implemented the freeze on funds on July 26 can continue to be cashed abroad. The black market buys this type of foreign exchange at an increased price. (3) The black market can purchase foreign exchange for export goods at a price that is one-tenth higher than the Exchange Equalization Fund's exchange rate. For these reasons, remnants of the black market still remain. The buyers in the black market are no more than those whose imported goods cannot obtain foreign exchange from the banks designated by the Exchange Equalization Fund, and foreigners who are unable to obtain foreign exchange after selling real estate, etc. Therefore, the Exchange Equalization Fund must request the US, British, and Dutch governments to notify banks, warning them that the statutory foreign exchange for imported goods must not flow into the black market, and request that the United States stop the circulation of US dollar notes abroad. Foreign exchange for export goods must be sold to the banks designated by the Exchange Equalization Fund at the statutory exchange rate. In this way, the remnants of the black market foreign exchange can be eliminated, which will prove to be of great benefit to the city, as merchants suffer significant losses during flooding. As for the method of raising the 4 million yuan needed by the Municipal Council, it will be decided soon. It cannot be said now whether this money will be raised by increasing taxes.

### The SS Zoella Lykes Sets Sail Without Unloading Gasoline

The new cargo ship SS Zoella Lykes of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai for the first time on the evening of the 11th of this month and docked at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to unload cargo. After the cargo was unloaded, it was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Manila on the 16th. Unexpectedly, due to the fact that more than 7,000 barrels of gasoline were still on board and customs formalities had not been completed, it was detained by the customs. After learning of this, the Japanese authorities immediately notified the customs, ordering that the gasoline on board had to be unloaded in Shanghai. After negotiations with the customs and the Japanese consulate by the American consulate, a resolution was reached. The ship set sail at 2 p.m. yesterday and exited the Wusongkou at 3:50 p.m., heading straight for the Philippines. None of the gasoline on board was unloaded, and it was transported to the Philippines as originally planned, without any fines.

### Regarding the Sniper Attack: Japanese Ultimatum

According to Dalu News, Horiuchi, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, has sent a note to the Shanghai Municipal Council, urging it to pay attention to the recent sniper attacks on Japanese nationals in the International Settlement. A spokesman for the Municipal Council confirmed that the Council had received the note, stating that "the Council is greatly concerned about this situation." However, the spokesman declined to say how the Municipal Council would respond to the note.

### Robbers Snatch Guard's Box Cannon, Guard Shot Dead, Original Gun and Robber's Gun Seized, Another Guard's Handgun Robbed and Wounded by Bullet

A guard named Ge Xitai, from Yangzhou, forty-eight years old, badge number 627, working at No. 25, Lane, Beile Road, i.e. Baoanli in the French Concession, was on duty at the lane entrance at about 6:30 p.m. yesterday when three robbers suddenly approached, pretending to ask for directions. Two of the robbers then produced handguns,

Threatening Ge

and forbidding him from making any noise. One of the robbers, unarmed, forcibly cut the lanyard of the box cannon he was wearing with scissors, and snatched the weapon. However, Ge was unwilling to submit and followed closely behind. As the robbers fled north to Luzon Road, crossed Avenue Edward VII, and reached Chongqing Road and Weihaiwei Road, the guard secretly reported to a Chinese constable on duty, who joined in the pursuit. The constable drew his gun and fired a shot, which struck one of the robbers near his right breast,

Penetrating his Back

and killing him on the spot. The other two robbers managed to escape. The constable found the original stolen box cannon in the dead man's pocket, as well as a robber's gun. The body was sent by Constable No. 3198 to Shijiang Hospital and then to the morgue. It is reported that the dead robber was about thirty years old and was wearing a brown striped woolen suit. In another incident yesterday, a guard's handgun was robbed and he was wounded by a bullet.

### Restriction on Gasoline Supply, New Methods to be Established, Maximum Supply Limit of Sixty Gallons per Month

It is reported that British company Asiatic Petroleum Company and American company Texaco are considering specific measures to restrict the amount of gasoline used by consumers in the city. The general idea is to supply based on the average amount used in the past four, five, six, three months, but the maximum supply limit is 60 gallons per month. Nighttime service will be suspended, effective from the 23rd. Gasoline sales will also be suspended on Sundays. According to investigations, Shanghai's gasoline reserves have increased slightly recently due to the arrival of British and American ships, which brought a batch of gasoline. It can supply the city for about six more days. The implementation of the restrictions this time is due to the past occurrence of black market transactions, so it is necessary to prevent them.

### Extortionist Arrested in Dadong Teahouse, Stole a Handgun and Took a Risk, Extortion Finally Leads to Legal Trouble

The extortionist Wu Bohe, also known as Zhang Jianhua, (28 years old this year, from Ningbo) colluded with Hua Ziming, who is at large, between the 4th and 9th of this month, sending letters to the home of Yu Ronglu, a wealthy Shanghai merchant from Ningbo, at No. 18, Lane 58, Metcalfe Road, extorting US$2,000 (equivalent to 40,000 legal currency). He was arrested by the Chengdu Road Police Station, and a Whiteley-brand handgun and seven bullets were seized. He was taken into custody for investigation.

Stealing a Handgun

The defendant confessed that he was introduced by a friend to work as a clerk at Laoda Fang Tea and Food Shop at No. 542, Nanjing Road, on March 1 last year. After being dismissed by the shop owner Chen Zhenyan on June 30, he went to Suzhou to join the army. On March 3 of this year, he secretly came to Shanghai with Zhu Liang after conspiring to do so. Late at night, they pried open the wooden door of Laoda Fang, broke into the shop, opened the cash register drawer, and stole Chen Zhenyan's self-defense handgun and more than 100 bullets, returning to Suzhou.

Resorting to Suicide

Around August 20, he saw a young man attempting suicide in the park. After he managed to rescue him, he inquired about the reason for his suicide. The young man claimed to be surnamed Yu, named Xiaochun, from Ningbo, and a cousin of the plaintiff in this case. Due to unemployment and inability to make a living, he had begged people for help without success, feeling that living in the world was meaningless, so he attempted suicide. Zhu Liang learned of the situation and also resented Yu Ronglu for not caring about his own family, so he took Yu Xiaochun to Suzhou and decided to ask Yu Ronglu to provide Yu Xiaochun with US$2,000, otherwise, they would end his life.

Extortion

Therefore, Hua Ziming and I were sent to Shanghai with hand grenades, a handgun, bullets, and extortion letters to deliver. According to the confession, the police sent the criminal Wu to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning, filing a public prosecution for crimes of extortion, theft, and endangering public safety. Judge Zhong took the bench and heard the case. Zhu, a maid of the plaintiff's family, testified that on the morning of the 4th of this month, the defendant came to our back door, took out a package, and asked me to send it upstairs for the master to see. I ignored him, and he then used a gun to force me to take it up. The master opened the package, which contained a bomb and an extortion letter. The master then telegraphed the police station, who sent detectives to take the bomb away.

Solving the Case in the Teahouse

And ordered the master to pretend to agree to pay the money, and to go to the Bund Park to deliver it as agreed. But on the morning of the 9th, the defendant himself broke the appointment, and in the afternoon, he called my master and asked him to go to Dadong Teahouse to pay the money. Following up, the plaintiff Yu Yinglu testified that before I went to Dadong Teahouse, I had already notified the police station, and pre-arranged plainclothes detectives to wait in the teahouse. When the defendant arrived at about 4 o'clock and was in contact with him, the detectives swarmed up and arrested him, and seized a handgun loaded with live ammunition from his side. After the court verified the situation and questioned the defendant in detail, he was ordered to be remanded in custody, and the hearing was postponed to the 27th. The handgun bullets were first returned to Chen Zhenyan to receive.

### New Hong Kong Government Entry Regulations Witness Qualifications

In order to meet wartime needs, the Hong Kong government has promulgated new entry regulations, strictly limiting entry and transit passengers. The newly established conditions for guarantors applying for entry permits are as follows: (1) Justices of the Peace in Hong Kong; (2) Barristers or lawyers practicing in Hong Kong; (3) Chinese government agencies with offices in Hong Kong; (4) Major banks or shipping companies in Hong Kong; (5) Those who hold title deeds to land in Hong Kong proving that they are wholly owned by them; (6) Managers of Western or Chinese General Chamber of Commerce or owners of member firms under them, or office staff of the firms; (7) Members of stock trading associations or brokerage trading associations, etc. Only then will they have the power to sign guarantees for others. The regulations stipulate that the guarantor must sign at the Immigration Department before approval can be granted, with the aim of preventing the mixing in of undesirable elements. However, temporary entry permits issued by China Travel Service are still given preferential treatment. Transit passengers are allowed to be exempted from providing a guarantor and given a special certificate to pass through Hong Kong. Those visiting relatives are also exempted from guarantee and given a special certificate with a time limit to leave Hong Kong, because the company has handled entry matters in the past with good credit, and are allowed to continue to handle matters flexibly according to previous practice.

### A Note on the Industrial Accident at the Xin Xin Mooncake Factory

The Xin Xin Company's mooncake factory, located on Niuzhuang Road, is a three-bay house with a spacious area. In the corner of the room is a baking oven, which is about the size of a room, and as high as the eaves. Steel grids are stacked in layers, and steam is boiling. The mooncakes are placed inside and replaced from time to time, so there is no immersion in gas or the drawback of being over-burnt. It is said to have been designed by experts and recently completed. Opposite the oven is the ingredient room, and to the right is the mooncake printing room. Dozens of male and female workers are all dressed in snow-white clothes and hats, which is quite neat. They are arranged at tables, each performing their duties, moving quickly and in an orderly manner. Once the mooncakes are printed, they are placed on steel trays and sent to be baked in batches. According to technician Zhuo Junyan, the amount of ingredients used and the seasoning process are all personally handled by me. Even the smallest nut must be peeled and washed clean. Zhuo Junyan believes that ordinary mooncakes are too sweet and greasy, and are not suitable for serving with wine. The Phoenix Thousand-Layer Mooncake is designed to make up for this shortcoming. All the ingredients used in the mooncake are savory, and are based on fresh and delicious ingredients that can be served with wine. The crust of the mooncake is made with genuine white shortening and lotus seed paste, which is soft and snow-white, and is the Vitamin Mooncake. Other mooncakes, such as the Yuanbao Gold and Silver Mooncakes, are also quite interesting and suitable for women's psychology. As for the various brocade boxes, they are all able to come up with new ideas and never stick to old methods. The decoration is extremely exquisite, and the styles include fan-shaped, oval, crescent-shaped, octagonal, plum blossom-shaped and various patterns, so the boxes are elegant and beautiful according to the shape of the mooncakes.

### Observation and Experiment of Solar Eclipse

— Zhang Chunlu

A solar eclipse is truly a cosmic spectacle. In broad daylight, a dark shadow suddenly comes from the west, gradually obscuring the sun, and suddenly the world becomes dark. After a few minutes, the sun slowly reappears, still shining on the earth. But this phenomenon is difficult to see. According to astronomers, there are an average of 238 solar eclipses every 100 years, of which only 66 are total eclipses. If we talk about a certain place, then the chance of seeing it is even less, only once every 360 years.

We are very lucky that there happens to be a solar eclipse at noon today; and this solar eclipse, in some places in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang and other provinces, can see the total solar eclipse. Children who live in Shanghai can also see a partial solar eclipse (only part of it is eclipsed). Many scientists have brought various instruments to observe in places with total eclipses, because this is a rare opportunity in decades!

Children! Although we do not have observation instruments and cannot run to the place of the total eclipse. But you can't miss this opportunity to observe with the naked eye. If the sunlight is too strong during a partial eclipse and the naked eye cannot look directly at it, you can wear a pair of sunglasses or tinted glasses, or you can see through colored or tinted glass. If you put some clear water in a basin, then pour some ink into it, stir it evenly and put it in the sunlight, so that the sunlight is reflected from the surface of the water for observation, then many people can observe it together (as shown in the picture above). As for the principle of solar eclipses, I think the children have already understood it. That is because the moon travels between the sun and the earth, blocking the light from the sun to the earth, and a part of the earth is in the shadow behind the moon, and this becomes a solar eclipse (as shown in the picture above). To deeply understand this principle, you can use a simple method to do an experiment yourself. Use candlelight (or kerosene lamp) to represent the sun, a ball (or something else) to represent the moon, and your head to represent the earth. If one is on a straight line, then the candlelight is blocked by the ball, and the cause of the solar eclipse is also the same. If you move the ball up or down slightly, you can see part of the candlelight, which is exactly the same as a partial solar eclipse. Move it again, and the candlelight is completely exposed, which can indicate the principle that even if the moon is in the middle of the sun and the earth, a solar eclipse does not occur (as shown in the middle picture).

Dear children! Observation and experiment are important tasks in scientific research, which can help you to expose the mysterious phenomena of nature and to reveal the truth of natural changes. Children, give it a try!

### What is a Solar Eclipse?

— Zhao

Brother: Brother, what exactly is a solar eclipse? I learned very little about astronomy at school. A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that there will be a solar eclipse this year, and that most of this area is in China!

Brother: Astronomy is indeed a very profound science, but solar eclipses are not difficult to explain clearly in simple terms.

Brother: Then please explain my doubts in the simplest terms.

Brother: Okay, let's start! The sun's rays shining on the earth are blocked by the moon in the middle, which is called a solar eclipse. Complete blockage means that the sun cannot be seen on earth, which is called a total eclipse. Blocking part of it still allows you to see the sun, but there is a piece missing, which is called a partial eclipse.

Brother: The moon is much smaller than the sun, how can it block the huge sunlight?

Brother: Yes, the moon is very small, so the area of the solar eclipse is a very small part of the earth. However, the reason why it can block the sunlight in the solar eclipse area can be proved by experiment: first close your left eye, and put a copper coin in front of your right eye about half a foot away, and look at the sun, can't you see the sun?

Brother: Ah! Yes, if there were no copper coins, my eyes would definitely not be able to open.

Brother: Because the copper coin blocked your line of sight to the sun, you can only get the light reflected from the side. It's not completely dark like during a solar eclipse, because the solar eclipse area is large, and the reflected light from the side cannot reach the line of sight, so it is naturally dark. Now open your left eye and look at the sun...

Brother: I am forced to open it.

Brother: This is because the copper coin is too small to block the line of sight of both eyes at the same time. Just like during a solar eclipse, place A becomes dark and place B remains bright.

Brother: I heard that there is also something called a gold coin eclipse, what exactly is it?

Brother: The earth's orbit around the sun is elliptical, so the distance between the earth and the sun is far and near. When the sun is farther away from the earth, the moon can only block the central part of the sun, so it looks like a gold coin, you might as well try it with a copper coin.

Brother: Oh! I remembered, in Chinese customs, there is something called "wild moon swallowing domestic moon" which we call a lunar eclipse. It must be that the earth is in the middle blocking the sunlight shining on the moon.

Brother: Not only is it so during a lunar eclipse, but the waxing and waning of the moon at ordinary times is also related to the earth and the sun.

Brother: Astronomers have a very clear understanding of the sun, why are they still tirelessly researching it?

Brother: Of course, there is no end to learning, I want to get new discoveries from this. And recently there was a person named Einstein who created many theories, many of which are different from before. Many scientists want to prove whether his theory is consistent with the facts, so they must observe the facts in detail. However, this kind of science is more profound and cannot be simply explained.

### The Height of Body Temperature

— Lin Ren

My younger sister's fever subsided a little the next morning. On this day, Mother got up early and came to see my younger sister. She touched Mother's forehead. Although the fever had subsided a lot, it had not completely gone away. Such a good result overnight had made her old heart a lot more at ease. Otherwise, with a worried mind, she would have eaten half less dinner last night, and even had trouble falling asleep at night.

"Fortunately, my younger sister's fever has subsided a bit, otherwise, it would be a very annoying thing," Mother said softly with a look of joy on her face, so as not to disturb my younger sister's sleep.

"That's right, if the body temperature rises further, it would indeed be very dangerous," Ah Liang's father said casually, but these words contained some unlucky elements in Mother's mind, so she had to ask Ah Liang's father and him not to stay here any longer. So Ah Liang followed his father to another room. However, these words that Mother thought were unlucky entered Ah Liang's ears and aroused a question.

"Dad, then how high can a person's body temperature be?" Ah Liang asked softly.

"If a person's body temperature reaches 107 degrees Fahrenheit, that person will definitely not be able to live. It is 100% certain that he will die. Even if it reaches 105 degrees, it is very dangerous, but there is still a glimmer of hope, because once the body reaches such a high temperature, it seems to be burning, and the brain will stop functioning. If that person's body is originally not strong, even if it reaches 105 degrees, he will not be able to bear it and die. However, the strangest thing is that in summer, the weather is extremely hot, and when the mercury column of the thermometer rises to more than 120 degrees, we can still work and will not die from the heat. Even if it is hot to 140 or 150 degrees, people will not die from the heat, isn't this a very strange thing? What is the reason for this? It's all because our body has the ability to sweat, otherwise, we will inevitably die from the heat, because the hotter the weather, the more we sweat, and these high-temperature places must be very dry, so that your sweat can evaporate quickly, and the body will feel cooler. Although a person's body temperature cannot exceed the standard of 98.4 degrees, it cannot be too low either. If it drops below 66 degrees, he will also die. At this time, the blood vessels in the body are affected by the low body temperature and become paralyzed. The circulation of blood is also obstructed, leading to stiffness and death. Therefore, everyone's body temperature must reach the standard of 90.4 degrees, not a little more or a little less, otherwise, they cannot be considered healthy, and all human beings have such a standard body temperature, whether they are yellow, white, black, red and other different races of people, their body temperatures are mostly the same, which is also a very strange thing." Ah Liang's father then closed his storybox and went out.

### On the Types of Early Morning Movies

— Courtesy and Righteousness

Besides the first-run movies, various cinemas screen early morning movies every Sunday and on public holidays. Obviously, this is to facilitate people who are usually too busy on weekdays, especially students. Here, leaving aside the main feature early morning screenings, let's talk about a few films that are regularly screened in the early morning. Generally speaking, the quality of early morning movies is quite high. Although the films screened in the early morning are not necessarily the biggest box office hits or the most critically acclaimed films of the past, early morning movies generally fall into three categories:

Musical films often account for the largest number of early morning films; this is naturally because the student community has a special love for singing. Deanna Durbin's musicals seem to be the most popular, such as "One Hundred Men and a Girl," "That Certain Age," "Mad About Music," and "It's a Date," which people never tire of watching. Secondly, such as "The Great Waltz," "Strike Up the Band," "Maytime," "Sweethearts," and "Ramona," are also beautiful musical masterpieces worth watching, and it is no accident that they are enthusiastically supported by the audience.

War films and films with grand scenes similar to war are also as popular as musical films. Errol Flynn's "The Adventures of Robin Hood," "The Adventures of Robin Hood," etc., are the most popular. Secondly, such as "The Charge of the Light Brigade," "The Last Days of Pompeii," "The Crusades," and "New Outlaws of the Marsh," often make people feel the need to watch them again, because they are so great and moving!

Historical films and literary films often attract a large audience, especially people with higher levels of knowledge, due to their moving themes. Such as "You Can't Take It With You," "The Life of Emile Zola," "A Tale of Two Cities," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," "Maid of Salem," "Camille," "Marie Antoinette," and "Oliver Twist," are all of profound significance. Sometimes, to cater to children, films such as "The Little Princess" and "Mulan" are screened; or horror films such as "The Invisible Man Returns" and "The Mad Doctor of Market Street"; or slapstick comedies such as "The Taming of the Shrew" and "Blockheads"; or cartoons such as "Mickey Mouse Collection" and "Donald Duck," the standard is lower!

In addition, it is worth mentioning that several domestic film theaters screen old films such as "Crossroads," "Street Angel," and "Lost Lamb," which have a special flavor. In short, the standard of early morning movies is high, and the price is extra cheap, which is a great convenience for people who are usually too busy!

New Movie Introduction

### The Road to Stardom for a Singer

— Zeng Xuan

"The Road to Stardom for a Singer" focuses on the singing of the heroine Mary Martin, and the performance is humorous. Mary plays Cindy, a girl who is fascinated by singing and dancing. Her voice is not as soaring as Jeanette MacDonald's, but it is sweet, clear, and crisp, and her high and low notes are melodious and pleasant. Her performance is also very dedicated. Changing from a standard American accent to a southern American accent makes it even more unique.

Since "One Touch of Venus," the male lead, Don Ameche, has starred in several similar song and dance films, which are quite popular with the audience; however, it always feels that his facial muscles are not very flexible, so his acting is not amazing. Paramount probably borrowed him from 20th Century Fox to star in "The Road to Stardom for a Singer" because of his fame. In this film, Don plays director Lloyd. Although he has a lot of scenes, his acting skills are not as brilliant as before, and it seems that he will not have much progress in the future.

The original English name of "The Road to Stardom for a Singer" is translated as "Kiss the Boys Goodbye". The big advertisement for the film on the side of the road also depicts a girl raising her lips high, "waiting for a kiss." But the so-called "Kiss the Boys Goodbye" is just the name of a song in the film and has nothing to do with the film itself.

Several songs in this film are very pleasant to listen to. The song and dance scenes are not grand. Rochester, the gravel-voiced black man in the supporting cast, dances very well. In this film, there is only a short slapstick dance performance, and there is nothing new. The plot seems to be very ordinary. The heroine Cindy is a rich girl, but she fails the audition for a stage singer on Broadway in New York. Director Lloyd goes south to look for a female lead. Cindy returns to her hometown in the south and tricks Lloyd into her house. Cindy pretends to be pretentious, singing and dancing, but still does not meet Lloyd's expectations. She then forcibly drags Lloyd back to New York. Lloyd is eventually seduced by Cindy's beauty and promises her the lead role. Cindy suspects that Lloyd is deceiving her, and is very angry. At the welcome party, she deliberately flaunts her charm. When singing in public, she takes off all her clothes, leaving only a bathrobe, embarrassing Lloyd. The song is bleak and she returns to her hometown. Lloyd chases after her to explain the misunderstanding and make a vow of lifelong love. Then, the screen shows Don and Mary hugging and about to kiss, and then turning to the audience under the screen to say: "Everyone, it's over." This "gimmick" is seen for the first time.
