### U.S. House of Representatives Passes Appropriation for Developing Naval and Air Bases; Fortifications to be Constructed in Newfoundland, Guam, and Other Locations; Military Attachés Dispatched to the Dutch East Indies and Singapore

Washington – Amidst the danger of the United States declaring war on Japan, the House of Representatives yesterday passed with an overwhelming majority a bill allocating US$245,228,500 for establishing naval and air bases in Newfoundland, Trinidad, Samoa, and Guam. The bill was then submitted to the Senate. Guam is located 1,500 miles south of Yokohama. The House, disregarding Japan’s opposition, decided to establish a naval base on the island, sparking the most bellicose remarks against Japan by American lawmakers in years. The passage of this bill is the first step in President's proposal last week to supplement national defense expenditures by $898,000,000. Representative Vinson, a Democrat from Georgia and Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, when initiating the debate on establishing naval bases in Guam and Samoa, read a letter from Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, advising Congress to disregard Japan’s opposition and proceed with expanding bases in the Pacific. The letter stated, "The US proposal to improve Guam's defense is by no means for offensive purposes. If Japan deems it as offensive, I think we can disregard Japan's suspicions. Fundamentally, Guam is a US territory. Our actions should be based on the best interests of the United States and should not be influenced by foreign countries." Vinson then recited a letter of similar nature from Secretary of the Navy Knox, stating that improving Guam's defense is of utmost importance to the Navy. Vinson added critically that the U.S. Navy is now fully prepared to deal with any contingency. During the debate, Representative Faddis, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, urged the United States to notify Japan immediately that if Japan attacked Singapore, the U.S. Navy would cut off their main supply line and annihilate them. Representative Anderson, a Republican from Minnesota, urged the U.S. to impose a complete embargo on raw materials to Japan. Faddis said that the blood of the Chinese people was still fresh on Japan’s hands, yet they were thinking of further portraying themselves as peace-loving people to the whole world, which was tantamount to secretly threatening the United States and forcing the United States to cooperate with them. The time for the United States to rise up has come. We do not need to worry that the Japanese will seize Singapore. Japan would never dare to engage in a war with a first-class nation unless absolutely necessary. Representative Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, stated that the House's previous opposition to fortifying Guam to avoid provoking Japan was a cowardly attitude. (United Press dispatch of the 20th)

Washington – The House of Representatives yesterday passed the naval base development appropriation bill and also approved, on a temporary basis, $4.7 million for shelters to allow the use of Guam's harbor for naval, land, and air forces, and to develop Guam into an outpost of the Fourth Fleet's maritime air force. It also approved $8.1 million for similar development of the base on Tutuila Island in the Samoan Islands. In the process of naval base advancement, the House also tentatively approved the continued allocation of $66 million for the development of bases in the Atlantic acquired from Britain. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)

Washington – The US government yesterday dispatched Major Jackson as the Army Attaché to Bangkok, Major Brink as the Army Attaché to Singapore, and Lieutenant Colonel Campbell as the Army Attaché to Batavia to enhance Army intelligence in the Far East. All three are currently in the Philippines and will assume their posts on March 1. (United Press dispatch of the 20th)

Nomura Makes Speech in the United States; Strives to Ease Tensions

Washington – Japanese Ambassador Nomura, in a moderate tone last night, strove to ease tensions in the Far East and stated that he did not believe that war would break out between the United States and Japan. He also said that if the United States did not want to launch a war, then war could be avoided. However, he insisted that Japan would always abide by the Axis treaty. (International News Service dispatch of the 20th)

Washington – Nomura told reporters yesterday that Japan did not like seeing a great power establish naval and air bases near Japan. However, Japan recognized that the Philippines, Guam, and Samoa were US territories and therefore the United States had the right in principle to make any arrangements on those islands. He believed that the United States would not build huge naval and air bases in the Philippines. Someone then asked Ambassador Nomura to explain the report made to the Diet this week by Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi, who said that Japan was trying to ensure that the Philippines would not endanger Japan in the future. Nomura replied that he did not believe that we have the terror of being threatened by the Philippines. He said that Japan certainly did not want to see naval and army bases, such as Guam and Samoa, approaching. When it came to the question of whether he considered the Philippines to be included within the scope of Japan's economic expansion, Nomura firmly refused to answer. He pointed out that the Philippines still belonged to the United States, but that Japan had already obtained a large amount of raw materials from the Philippines and also sold products to the Philippines. Nomura said that Japan was interested in the House's approval of the Guam defense works. He said that Japan considered its southward advance to be merely an economic event. (United Press dispatch of the 20th)

Washington – Japanese Ambassador Nomura told a United Press reporter that Japan hoped to quickly resolve the China Incident and said that he hoped that the Chongqing government could also participate in this effort. If China could establish peace, then the United States' policy of equal trade opportunities and Japan's goals could be integrated. In the current occupied areas of China, the situation has formed a prelude to this equality. Nomura emphasized that Japan's final procedure was to give third countries complete commercial equality in China. Regarding the Soviet Union, Nomura said that Japan was negotiating with the Soviet Union on long-pending cases, including fishery agreements and the demarcation of the border between Manchuria and Mongolia. Regarding the issue of demarcation between Manchuria and Mongolia, Japan must have talked with the Soviet Union about concluding a non-aggression treaty. (United Press dispatch of the 20th)

If Japan Does Not Change Its Current Policy, It Is Difficult to Hope for Restoring Friendship with the United States

New York – Ambassador Nomura has now arrived and is in a time of tense US-Japan relations. Both Tokyo and Washington believe that Nomura will present Roosevelt with a kind of magically effective proposal to dispel war rumors and restore friendship between the two countries. However, reporters in the United States, within the Japanese cabinet and among the people, could not find anyone who believed that this proposal could succeed unless unexpected changes occurred in world affairs. It is not easy to reconcile the United States and Japan, and the prerequisite for reconciliation is the following three conditions: (1) Japan must have a strong and powerful government that unifies the national will and represents the will of the people. Since the Manchurian Incident, the Japanese cabinet has changed frequently, and no one can control the warlords. (2) Japan must enlarge its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere plan. (3) The Sino-Japanese War should be ended, and China should remain a free and independent country. (4) Japan should withdraw from the alliance with Germany and Italy. Some observers believe that Nomura is prepared to act quickly or to make generous concessions when the time is ripe, depending on the fate of the Axis powers in Europe. (United Press dispatch of the 20th)

Washington – The situation in the Far East has become the focus of attention for political and diplomatic circles here. In general, it is believed that unless Japan changes its current policy in the Western Pacific, the United States cannot concede an inch of the position it holds in the Far East.

### Australia and India Prepare to Cope with Contingencies; Australian Troops Landing in Singapore Stationed at Various Strongholds in Malaya

Melbourne – Acting Australian Prime Minister Fadden said in a speech that after reviewing the national defense system, the government has continued to take precautions to prevent sudden and unexpected events. Australia will not take any action or words that could shake peace in the Pacific. If war is forced upon Australia's doorstep, it will not be caused by us. Others should not think that we have no way to call for help and are not suitable for such a great test. The Australian troops landing in Malaya are of the same quality as the Australian troops who defeated the Italian army in Libya and are famous for the Gallipoli campaign. Australia is prepared to cope with any event and believes that Britain will win victory. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)

Bombay – The entire territory of India is now closely watching the tense situation in the Far East. The arrival of Australian troops in Singapore has aroused widespread satisfaction. Many Indian soldiers have enlisted in Malaya, and the strict training they have received after enlisting has given them a thorough understanding of everything in Malaya. The Indian government is now prepared to cope with any contingency. (Reuters dispatch of the 10th)

Singapore – An official spokesman declared last night that the arrival of Australian troops in Singapore was enough to further ensure the safety of Malaya. Early yesterday morning, the landing soldiers were dispatched to various strongholds in Malaya. The spokesman said that the arrival of Australian troops in Malaya should give greater optimism about security issues. Australia should be proud of its sons and daughters who are undertaking important work in the defense of the empire. The so-called important work was first in Britain, then in the Middle East, and now in East Asia. At the same time, the army commander, Lieutenant General Bennett, declared that the Australian troops were undertaking serious work in Malaya. He broadcasted, "We are undertaking serious work here. Australians have always regarded Singapore as Australia's outpost, so we feel that defending Singapore is very helpful to our own national defense. Our troops have been trained as assault soldiers, and I dare to say that they will be able to fight bravely, just like the heroic political achievements of their ancestors in the past. I now shout to the people of Malaya, your war is our war. If the enemy comes to Malaya, Australians will also come and severely injure this invading enemy." (United Press dispatch of the 20th)

It is heard that the Dutch East Indies government intends to send Dutch experts to accompany the Japanese to the locations they have designated. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)

Tokyo – Japanese semi-official sources in Batavia said that Yoshizawa and Hogesteger, director of the Dutch Commercial Bureau, received news that some residents along the Malay border had moved to the interior of Thailand, and that a large number of British destroyers, aircraft, and merchant ships carrying troops had arrived in southern Burma. (Haito News Agency dispatch of the 20th)

Tokyo – According to news from Bangkok, the Thai government has denied the claims that British warships appeared near the Thai coast and that British troops invaded southern Thailand. (Haito News Agency dispatch of the 20th)

### Japan Makes Demands to the Dutch East Indies

Batavia – According to news broadcast by a US radio station, after the Japanese government reopened economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies authorities, it has made several formal demands, one of which is to raise the number of Japanese farmers allowed to go to the Dutch East Indies, and the other is to allow Japan to study the production status and development of the Dutch East Indies oil fields. It is generally believed that the Dutch East Indies government will accept these demands, but with the condition that when Japanese experts inspect the Dutch East Indies oil fields, they should be accompanied by Tredenton. A meeting will be held this morning to exchange opinions on the Dutch East Indies and Japanese proposals, and meetings will continue tomorrow morning. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)

There were also previous reports that there were three Japanese destroyers in the Gulf of Siam, and another was stationed in Bangkok. (United Press dispatch of the 20th)

### U.S. Senate Debates Lend-Lease Bill

Washington – Democratic Senator Bailey, during the third day of Senate debate on the Lend-Lease Bill yesterday, declared that the implementation of this bill meant that the United States was interfering in the European war. He hoped that this interference would not mean war. If it became war, then he was prepared to participate in the war. This bill could give the United States the opportunity to liberate the world from totalitarian revolution. Another Democratic Senator, Connally, declared that democratic countries must act in unison, otherwise they would be defeated individually. If the Axis powers were victorious in Europe, they would soon attempt to invade North and South America. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)

Editorial

### Has the International Situation Eased?

Some believe that the international situation has eased somewhat recently. This impression may not be accurate. In terms of the situation, starting from the September 18th Incident in 1931 further back, and starting from the end of August 1939 closer up, every minute has been gradually worsening, until today and beyond, continuing to worsen, never stopping, and certainly not improving in the slightest. As for the atmosphere feeling tense or relaxed, it is only the psychological reaction of those who do not grasp the core of the situation following superficial fluctuations, and there is no change in the continuously worsening international situation. Even the panic a few days ago and the relief recently are both excessive.

Why do some think it has eased recently? In Europe: the agreement between Turkey and Bulgaria is merely a side issue in the evolution of the international situation and is insufficient to prevent the possible expansion of the Balkan war. Looking at it from another angle, it can also be seen as planting another hidden cause for the worsening situation. In short, the world situation considers the European situation to be a very important link. The European situation has already unfolded as it is now. Even if a settlement were mediated by an unexpected opportunity, it would at most make the war "stop" for a few years, but it would not be the "end" of the war. Moreover, there is no hope of mediation succeeding. Everything depends on the decisive battle between Britain and Germany. Recognizing this point, we know that the surface may have some temporary relaxation, but it is irrelevant to the fundamental issue.

In the Pacific: the Sino-Japanese War has already reached its fifth year. The front line may be stalemated or active, but the fact is that it is comprehensively stuck in a state of war. The current trend has also spread beyond the scope of China and Japan, with Japan's southward advance as the center, touching French Indochina, Thailand, the Dutch East Indies, and the United States and the Commonwealth of Australia. The panic a few days ago was due to the tense situation of Japan's southward advance. The Japanese authorities repeatedly stated that they would implement their strategy and must realize the so-called co-prosperity sphere, regardless of all protests, regardless of all opposition, and so on. Not only did they state this, but everything they did was obviously a layout for gradually implementing the southward advance. Therefore, the signs made Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia have to take joint countermeasures and actions. As a result, the general public felt that there would be a new war that would break out at any moment in that area, and the situation seemed precarious. The recent situation has no reason to be comforting. The biggest reason is only that the Japanese side's tone has softened. For example, Foreign Minister Matsuoka said that Japan does not intend to be the leader of all the people in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but only has confidence in having the strength to lead. Also, Foreign Minister Ohashi said that the government does not want to achieve its goals by force, but only wants to find solutions through negotiation. Also, Ambassador to the UK Shigemitsu verbally assured British Foreign Minister Butler that Japan had no intention of attacking British territories in the Pacific. Also, Ambassador to the United States Nomura also said that a US-Japan war could be avoided, and so on. In addition, the Japanese have proposed in both Tokyo and London that they are willing to mediate the European war. This is probably an act directed by Hitler, one of the faces of his usual peace offensives, and US Congressman Faddis immediately mocked it, saying, "The blood of the Chinese people on Japan's hands has not yet dried, yet they are thinking of further portraying themselves as peace-loving people to the whole world." However, the Japanese making this proposal at this time can also correspond and complement their other softened tones. Because of these various reasons, some think it has eased. If the world is convinced that the situation has eased somewhat, then there is no doubt that it is a great success of the Japanese side's anesthetization operation, and it is also a great success of borrowing "time." And the United States, in addition to unremittingly carrying out practical work, such as promoting the Aid Bill, sending warships to the west, and fortifying Guam, Secretary of State Welles also made a ruthless exposure of the Japanese side's words, saying, "In today's extremely serious situation in the world, the US government is more interested in the actions of other countries than in the statements made by their spokesmen." This is a pointed statement. Sweet words are useless, where is the easing? The intention is to relax the hearts of all parties, possibly to delay the countermeasures and actions of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia, and then wait for the arrival of the environment they expect and seize the most favorable opportunity to realize their southward advance. In short, the key to the safety of the Pacific lies in whether Japan corrects its aggression in the invasion of China and the southward advance in facts and actions. Although this is related to the European situation and the entire international situation, it forms a separate link. No matter how the European situation is, no matter how the world situation is, the key is always here. If the key is not resolved for one day, the crisis will not be eliminated for one day, and Japan has so far no sign of correcting its aggressive strategy, and is obviously waiting for an opportunity to act. So, how can there be any so-called easing? The Pacific situation has unfolded as it is now. The remaining diverging paths are one, within the form and scope of the Sino-Japanese War, to force Japan to turn back from failure by China's frontal warfare and the strong support of the United States, etc.; the other is to leave the fighting to the Western Pacific and then force Japan to turn back. The decision of the diverging paths is greatly related to the decisive battle between Britain and Germany in Europe. If the United States' attitude is wise and strong, and it does not further adopt direct and active means, then no matter how soft the tone of the aggressors may be, it will at most make them temporarily wander in the above-mentioned diverging paths, and there is still no hope of restoring peace in the Pacific.

### Reorganization of Existing Japanese Forces; Unable to Increase Troop Deployment; Newly Organized Regiments Reduced in Size; Progress on All Chinese Fronts

Chongqing: A military spokesman stated to news reporters today that, in order to deceive the world and for the purpose of estimating its troop strength in China, Japan is currently broadcasting news of an increase in its army's size. In reality, the Japanese side is only reorganizing its existing forces and has not increased troop deployment. Currently, newly organized regiments of the Japanese army have been reduced from the former three battalions to two battalions, totaling 1,700 men, whereas previously there were 3,700 men. Therefore, the Japanese side can establish new regiments and new divisions without increasing its total troop strength, and can proclaim that they have surplus strength for a southward advance.

The friendly relations between Turkey and Bulgaria have now been reaffirmed. Given the current international situation, the two countries had to find a new way to clarify their relationship. After sincere negotiations, this agreement was established. I, on behalf of the government, express my satisfaction with this matter. This treaty demonstrates Bulgaria's desire for peace and will become Bulgaria's policy thereafter. Bulgaria has no intention of threatening other countries. Our country's immutable foreign policy is 'non-aggression.' We are deeply pleased that our country's policy has been understood by Turkey, thereby enhancing the friendly relations between the two countries. I believe that the parliament will unanimously approve this policy." (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 20th)

### Rumor that Germany Will Force Greece to Ceasefire with Italy

London: The Daily Telegraph diplomatic correspondent says that people here believe that Hitler's next move will be to coerce Greece into a ceasefire with Italy. If Greece refuses, Hitler will immediately threaten to send his armored divisions to Thessaly and Macedonia. The Greek army is currently fully engaged in fighting in Albania. Without reinforcements, it will be difficult to resist attacks from fresh German troops. After defeating the Italian army in North Africa, Britain is now able to increase its aid to Greece in the sea, land, and air. To make Greece better prepared to deal with the threat, it should be advised to stop its offensive in Albania to conserve ammunition for confronting the new enemy. A large delegation of American staff representatives has been in Athens for several months and must now be planning something. Germany is now planning to supply arms to the rebel factions in Macedonia and Croatia to carry out terrorist activities against the governments of Greece and southern Yugoslavia, to coerce the two countries.

Nairobi: This official bulletin announces that British forces are increasing pressure on the Italian Somaliland frontier Choba River battle line. An Italian counterattack was repulsed. The Italians suffered 40 fatalities, including 10 officers.

Khartoum: The fall of the city of Dancilla, 40 miles southwest of Lake Tana, was briefly announced yesterday. The capture of the city is the most important victory achieved by the Abyssinian patriotic forces to date. Strategically, Dancilla controls the entire province of Gojjam. The Italian side stationed a large unit of Blackshirts and other white troops there. It is not yet known whether these Italian troops were present when the city fell. On Sunday, the Italians abandoned the city under pressure. For several weeks prior, British officers had led patriotic Abyssinian troops in guerrilla warfare, frequently applying pressure, once attacking to within a few feet of the city's strong defenses, then approaching to attack for five days, finally cooperating with the British Air Force to deliver the final blow. British aircraft transmitted messages, allowing the patriotic Abyssinian troops to capture some of the Italian garrison that had fled the bombing. The remaining Italian garrison is retreating southeast towards the city of Bahrdar Georgis, south of Lake Tana, repeatedly harassed by small units of Abyssinian troops along the way. Dancilla is located at the foot of the northern slope of the 7,000-foot Abyssinian plateau and is the meeting point of two camel trails from the Abyssinian capital to the Sudanese border town of Gallabat and to a town on the Blue Nile. The city is sparsely populated, but since the Italian occupation, a road has been built along the camel trail to facilitate the transport of locally produced coffee, wheat, and other commodities.

London: A Reuters special correspondent reported that the Greek army achieved local victories in several locations on the northern Albanian border yesterday. Although Italian reinforcements have arrived, the Greek army is still maintaining its offensive on the entire front. Several divisions of fresh Italian troops have been seen moving between Elbasan and the Skumbi River. The Italian army also counterattacked in the districts of Tufari and Moschopolis, but the Greek army attacked at night, breaking through the Italian lines in the Tufari district and capturing hundreds of enemies. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Southern National Capital: According to reliable sources, German aircraft flew over Greece on Tuesday for reconnaissance purposes, without dropping bombs, and the Greek side did not fire upon them.

### British, Australian, and South African Air Forces Conduct Intense Activity; Assisting British and Greek Forces in East Africa and Albania

Cairo: The latest communique issued by the Middle East Command describes the intense activity of the British Air Force, the South African Air Force, and the Australian Air Force. It is reported that the airfields on the Italian Dodecanese Islands were bombed on the nights of February 16th and 17th. In the past two days, the British Air Force has assisted the Greek army in combat, concentrating bombing on Italian positions in the Tepelene area. Enemy troops and military buildings north of Tepelene were also heavily bombed. Bombing results could not be seen due to fog on the ground. Several squadrons of British fighters conducted offensive patrols. British aircraft also continued to provide assistance to British forces on all fronts in Italian East Africa. Military targets in and near Keren were attacked several times. While conducting offensive patrols, South African Air Force fighters shot down two Italian bombers. After strafing enemy aircraft on the ground at Karga, one bomber was seen to catch fire. Enemy fighters attempted to intercept British aircraft but were repelled. Military targets in Meiga, Abyssinia, were also bombed. On February 17th and 18th, enemy aircraft attacked Benghazi, one of which was shot down by an Australian squadron. The remaining aircraft were also heavily damaged and were likely unable to return to base. Anti-aircraft fire shot down one enemy bomber. One British bomber did not return to base.

### Japan Suggests to Britain its Willingness to Mediate in the European War; Matsuoka Has Formally Sent a Letter to Eden; Britain's Policy Will Not Change and the Offer Will Be Rejected

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has sent a special letter to British Foreign Minister Eden, stating that he is willing to take any necessary measures to restore normalcy not only in the Far East but also throughout the world. This official action, which supports the remarks made by Tokyo spokesman Ishii yesterday, gives special meaning to the idea of ​​mediating the war, which is far different from an occasional suggestion by a subordinate. Although Ishii stated that he had not consulted with Germany and Italy, this is a major step from the head of a government that has treaty relations with Germany and Italy. Matsuoka's letter will of course receive the consideration requested by the proposer, but the general and unchangeable principles of British policy are unlikely to change as a result. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

London: Undersecretary Butler's remarks in the House of Commons on Wednesday confirmed the claim that Japan will mediate in the European war. When a Member of Parliament asked the Undersecretary to make a statement on the situation in the Far East, Butler mentioned the general outline of the situation in the Far East, which has become increasingly tense due to certain events, such as the dispute between Thailand and French Indochina, and said, "A Japanese official spokesman made a statement to the press yesterday, and the British Foreign Minister has now received a special letter from the Japanese Foreign Minister, couched in gentle terms, with the general content being the same as the remarks of the Japanese spokesman. The British government is now paying considerable attention to this letter." (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

London: Japan has formally notified Britain of its willingness to mediate in the European war. Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka has sent a special letter to British Foreign Minister Eden. The letter is couched in polite terms and is largely the same as the statement made by the Japanese official spokesman yesterday. Observers here say that they believe that Britain will definitely reject this suggestion. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

Tokyo: The Miyako Shimbun newspaper said in an editorial today that Japan is the only country qualified to mediate in the European war. Although there is currently no hope for such mediation, Japan must be prepared to make contributions to mediation when the time is ripe. The Chugai Shogyo Shimpo newspaper also had an editorial, saying that Britain and the United States are now deliberately spreading unfounded rumors about the crisis in the Far East and are strengthening their military plans and defense work. Although the rumors will soon disappear, their war preparations cannot be laughed off. Japan can only promote its East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in response. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

London: A diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle published a startling comment regarding the source of the Japanese peace overture, saying that some observers believe that Japan and Germany have actually drawn up joint actions, in which Japan's activities in the Far East will be consistent with Germany's activities in Europe. This action was originally scheduled to be implemented last week, but for reasons that are not yet clear, the schedule was disrupted, so Japan issued a peace movement to divert attention, so that the disrupted schedule could be reorganized. Other observers believe that Japan's declaration and Matsuoka's telegram to the British Foreign Minister were directly instructed by the German Foreign Ministry and believe that this is a logical move by Hitler before implementing military operations in the spring, aimed at disrupting and diverting the attention of the United States, and again blaming Britain and the Allies for prolonging the war.

### Japanese-Soviet Negotiations Now Beginning

Tokyo: The Information Bureau issued a communique this afternoon announcing that Japanese-Soviet trade talks will begin for the first time in Moscow on the 17th of this month, in accordance with the agreement recently reached between Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa and Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov.

### Vietnam Increases Air Force Strength; Prohibits Japanese Rubber Shipments; Tokyo Accuses Vietnam of Anti-Japanese Activity

Hanoi: According to semi-official French sources, over a hundred members of the French Air Force have arrived here by French ship and have immediately gone to various air force bases in Saigon and key points in Cambodia and Laos to serve. These air force personnel were sent here by ship from France to increase the strength of the Vietnamese Air Force because the French-German armistice agreement does not allow French aircraft to fly over French airspace. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Tokyo: A Hanoi dispatch yesterday stated that French Vietnam has prohibited Japanese commercial firms from exporting rubber. French officials have issued new orders controlling rubber exports. It is heard that the Vietnamese government will form a joint government-commercial rubber export company. Representatives from the four major rubber groups and the government will jointly organize the company. All rubber exports from Vietnam will be sold through the company. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

Tokyo: An article published here today strongly criticized the Vietnamese authorities, accusing Vietnam of engaging in anti-Japanese activities. It is reported that a French staff officer negotiated the purchase of 200 aircraft from Singapore, part of which was exchanged for information to be provided to Japan's plan for Singapore. This rumor was reported by the Japanese telegraph office in Hanoi, which stated that as a result of the investigation, it has been discovered that the French authorities have continuously adopted economic and military means with the aim of defeating the Japanese Air Force in Southeast Asia. This trend has become more obvious since Britain and the United States reacted strongly to Japan's mediation of the Thai-French Indochina border conflict, and since British Indian and Australian troops have gathered along the southwestern border of Thailand.

European War Chat (30) (6)

### War Diary of a British Officer on the Western Front

4 PM: Montdidier and Compiègne have both fallen.

6 PM: Enemy forces have occupied Forges-les-Eaux and Granville. Rumor has it that the vanguard has reached Beauvais and Pontoise, only twenty miles northwest of Paris.

June 9th, 9:45 AM: Yesterday afternoon, the situation changed rapidly. The German army, with mechanized units as its vanguard, launched a large-scale offensive north of Reims. They have already crossed the Aisne River in a rapid advance. The British and French air forces will use all their strength to prevent the movement of the enemy tank corps. This offensive may be the beginning of a major encirclement. The German army intends to penetrate deep into France as far as the Loire River, and then, disregarding the French government, negotiate peace directly with the French people.

June 10th: Bridges are mined, ready to be blown up. As usual, the national spirit of destruction is very lacking, often only blowing up a few bridge arches near the shore, making repairs very easy. The Loire River here is several hundred yards wide. I think if the French line collapses, and they still want to continue resisting, the Loire River will be the last line of defense.

June 12th, 11:30 AM: There are three fresh German divisions south of Reims. Yesterday, the French command retreated to Maine, stationed in the town. There are now eighty German divisions on the line from the Channel to Montmédy. The French army has only thirty-five exhausted divisions. France no longer has any hope of turning defeat into victory.

12:10 PM: One-third of the French troops in the occupied areas have been withdrawn, further confirming the rumor of the French army's demoralization. It is estimated that half of the soldiers in the French army have hometowns in the occupied areas.

11:00 PM: Very bad news again tonight: the Seine River line has been breached.

June 13th, 10:40 AM: The general opinion is that the French army is about to retreat completely. Last night, a French officer told me, "We only have thirty-five divisions. Normally, each division defends no more than seven kilometers, but now some divisions have to defend thirty kilometers. Some are indeed elite troops, but some are not very reliable. The German army has eighty divisions, all better equipped than us. What can you do?"

12:00 AM: It is said that tens of thousands of French soldiers have abandoned their weapons and fled to the south bank of the Marne River. It is a recognized fact that 60% of French shells fail to explode.

The British Air Force squadron is scheduled to fly to the coast tonight. If the situation is not very urgent, we may follow in a day or two.

June 14th: The French army abandoned Paris last night, and the German Fourteenth Army will occupy it today. Although heavy clouds and rain have prevented air force activity, judging from intercepted German military orders, a large-scale bombing will be launched as soon as the weather clears.

12:15 PM: General Georges announced that the French army will retreat to the Loire River defense line and has decided to abandon the Maginot Line. This report is a major turning point in the war.

3:59 PM: General Georges also announced, "All organized resistance has completely ceased."

June 15th: Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, left Orléans with Wu Daoer and Osborne, via Le Mans to Angers. Le Mans is the location of the transport command. We visited British Commander General Brooke. We also visited the naval officer in charge of the evacuation. His name seemed to be Gallat, a serious and shrewd man. I will never forget the atmosphere in his office. The office room was in a large building, connected by wide rooms on both sides. It was very hot in the evening, and the seven or eight naval officers working indoors were so hot that they rolled up their sleeves. The room was as silent as death. Except for the occasional whisper, no one spoke. Only when giving orders by phone could the only sound be heard. The voice of command was concise and powerful, making it easy to understand their intentions. The air in the room was like that in a church. Everyone had their own thing to do, and they were doing it wholeheartedly. Soldiers who came to the office, whether officers or soldiers, were touched by this solemn atmosphere.

In addition to the 12,000 people we were about to evacuate, there were approximately 75,000 British troops still in France.

June 16th: Yesterday, we hurriedly left Angers. After saying a few words to a pilot at the airport, I learned that German tanks were only fourteen miles away from the road. The Air Force Commander-in-Chief advised me to wait at the airport until all the planes had flown out before going to South Tours. Wu Daoer and Osborne and I set off immediately.

The scenery along the way was very good. I have been familiar with this area since I was a child, but I have never crossed the Loire River so early before. The sandy beaches next to the river were wide and flat, and both sides were vineyards, which felt as familiar as home to me. We followed the south bank of the river, and at every village and bridge, resolute elderly villagers stopped and inspected. They all carried rifles and were very able to endure hardship. They set up obstacles to prevent the enemy's lighter motorized units. Although they could not stop the progress of tanks, they could stop motorcycles and military vehicles.

In the afternoon, we arrived at the headquarters of the British Air Force squadron south of Tours. The situation was chaotic. The relocation was originally scheduled to begin last night, but it was delayed by several hours. All kinds of objects were scattered all over the ground. This place was like a garbage dump this morning. There were officers' torn uniforms, typewriters, cars, trucks, medical supplies, etc. scattered everywhere on the grass.

We are waiting to depart, whether by car or plane, depending on the situation.

June 17th, 10:15 AM: This morning, the first reconnaissance plane brought accurate news of the enemy. German troops have entered Orléans. All the bridges have been blown up, and some places have caught fire. There were twelve vehicle-carrying vehicles parked on a small bridge twelve miles southwest of Orléans. This is nothing, but behind the tanks there were several refugee vehicles. The German engineering team is repairing the broken bridge. German tanks and French refugee vehicles are patiently waiting to cross the bridge together.

The military operation of retreating to the Bay of Biscay has not been completely completed.

The weather has provided a lot of convenience for the evacuation. Thunderstorms made it impossible to see clearly across the way. Last night, I hid under a Blenheim aircraft at the airport. Even though I was hiding there, the water passing under the plane almost washed me away.

Last night, a train drove by. An officer in our high-altitude artillery unit heard it in his sleep and thought it was a German mechanized unit. He immediately jumped out of bed but dislocated a toe. This was the first casualty in the high-altitude artillery unit.

12:00 PM: Received news of the French seeking peace.

5:30 PM: The last batch of ground personnel has departed.

5:50 PM: Air Force personnel and the Air Force Commander-in-Chief also flew away by plane.

5:55 PM: Wu Daoer, Osborne, and I, as well as thirty other officers, departed from the South Tours airport on five Blenheim aircraft.

8:00 PM: Landed in Hastings, England.

Later, I learned that a German motorcycle unit led the mechanized units into South Tours at midnight. (The End)

### Speech by Chairman Chiang at the 7th Anniversary Commemoration of the New Life Movement

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Fellow compatriots, why do we advocate propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame? Everyone must know that the opposite of "propriety" is a lack of order, discipline, and rules; the opposite of "righteousness" is a lack of trustworthiness, responsibility, and duty; the opposite of "integrity" is a lack of right and wrong, public and private, and a lack of emphasis on moral character;

The opposite of "shame" is a lack of integrity, shame, and awareness. Therefore, we must correct these shortcomings to truly practice the "Four Cardinal Principles." Looking at our New Life Movement, why do we advocate neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, plainness, speed, and certainty? This is to fundamentally cure the greatest ills of our nation. Everyone must know that the opposite of "neatness" is

Chaos and Disorganization

The opposite of "cleanliness" is filth and corruption; the opposite of "simplicity" is complexity and cumbersomeness; the opposite of "plainness" is luxury and extravagance; the opposite of "speed" is slowness and apathy; the opposite of "certainty" is hypocrisy and deceit. If these six major ills can be completely eradicated, China's nation-building work will advance a thousand miles a day. It is precisely because we have not completely eradicated these six major ills that even though the soldiers and civilians on the front lines have achieved

Heroic Achievements

The social atmosphere and individual lives of our entire nation still cannot promote the success of the war of resistance and nation-building. I believe that the shortcomings mentioned above, as manifested in social vices, are nothing more than the four ugly things: opium, gambling, theft, and prostitution. As manifested in individual lives, they are nothing more than the four inferior qualities: extravagance, laziness, greed, and cowardice. We only need to think about what the Japanese are

Occupied Areas

The rewards are nothing but opium, gambling, theft, and prostitution, and we can know that these four are toxins that cripple the lives of our nation. We only need to think about the fact that anyone who is extravagant, lazy, corrupt, and cowardly, even if they do not sell out the country, will harm the country, and we can know that these four are the greatest evils that hinder our war of resistance and nation-building. In a nutshell, opium, gambling, theft, and prostitution are public enemies of social survival,

Extravagance, Laziness, Greed, and Cowardice

Are the great enemies of individual life. If we cannot use the spirit of great courage and forbearance to mercilessly eliminate these two internal enemies, then our society will be unable to survive, and individuals will never be able to become self-reliant. We have fought to this day and have the confidence to expel foreign enemies and achieve victory, but if we do not defeat these two internal enemies, even if we expel the Japanese army, our

Nation and People

Will still have no way out, and may even be doomed to the tragic fate of a semi-colony. I ask, how can we face the revolutionary martyrs, how can we face the soldiers and civilians on the front lines, how can we face the compatriots who are suffering and displaced? Therefore, I ask everyone not to treat the New Life Movement as something unrelated to the war of resistance and nation-building. You must know that this is truly related to our 450 million people

Life and Death

A major event that determines the fate of thousands of generations. The reason why I am saying this repeatedly is to make our compatriots understand this meaning, to practice the New Life with full determination, and to promote society and implement the New Life with full enthusiasm. Now is the beginning of the eighth year of the New Life Movement. I feel that

Past Work

Was not real enough, nor was it universal enough. I believe that from now on, we should pay special attention to the assessment of the New Life Movement. We should implement assessments universally in the New Life Movement branch associations of various provinces and cities and in organizations at all levels, to evaluate the merits and demerits of various achievements, and we must hold them regularly in batches and stages, using the method of competition, rewards, and punishments to encourage everyone to practice the New Life. As for the actual work of transforming society and changing the social atmosphere in the future, I would like to put forward four points to our compatriots today, hoping that we will pay attention to them together and implement them consistently. First, we must earnestly abstain from gambling. Gambling is entertainment in various countries and seems unremarkable, but in our country, it is truly the greatest shame of the nation. It is not only a symbol of national decline and corruption but also the greatest obstacle to national morality. Everyone only needs to see people who gamble together. Because of

Victory and Loss

They become face-to-face enemies who compete and fight with each other, even to family members and friends, due to differences in victory and loss. Some people criticize the widespread gambling in China as causing the national vice of jealousy and hatred. This is not without reason. Therefore, gambling not only wastes time and money but also harms the feelings of national compatriots and is the greatest thief of love and sincerity. From now on, the whole country, from top to bottom, must deeply recognize that gambling and the mutual love and help of the nation in the new era cannot coexist. Whether in the front or the rear, in families, schools, or organizations, we should persuade each other to stop gambling and completely eradicate it. We must take advantage of this time of war to sweep away what is common in

All Levels of Society

This most shameful and painful stain. Second, we must thoroughly eliminate opium. The government has repeatedly ordered the prohibition of opium and the rejection of drugs. On the sixth anniversary of the New Life Movement last year, I also made the elimination of opium as one of the main tasks. At the end of the year, when the six-year opium prohibition plan expired, I sent a telegram to the whole country, urging them to abstain. At present, the prohibition of planting, transporting, selling, and smoking opium in our rear provinces has been largely completed, but the occupied areas are implementing a policy of poisoning them. We in the rear should be even more painfully aware and jointly eliminate the remaining opium, and we must not allow it to revive and undo all our previous efforts due to lack of prevention. We must know that the compatriots in the occupied areas cannot even quit opium freely if you are determined to quit opium. This is truly a miserable situation where you cannot live or die. However, our nation must not sit still and wait for death. Therefore, I especially want to urge the compatriots in the occupied areas that no matter what, we need to treat opium,

With Hatred and Abhorrence

Resolve to quit, swear not to be tempted, and regard quitting opium as important as fighting on the battlefield. Our governments and leaders at all levels should regard eliminating the embers of opium as the central task of this year's New Life Movement, and must thoroughly enforce the laws. The people should also encourage each other and cooperate to report. As for the political and military authorities, after recovering every lost territory in the front, they should regard thoroughly prohibiting opium as the most important policy for comforting and reforming the people. We must remove this greatest scourge so that all unreasonable vices can be eliminated and the spirit of positive progress can be brought into play. (Telegraph from the 18th) (To be continued)

### Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee Reports on Domestic Economic Conditions: Strengthening National Defense and Actively Manufacturing Airplanes and Tanks; The Current War Is Actually a War for Stockpiling and Storing

Moscow: The 18th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party continued its meeting yesterday. After the debate on Malenkov's report was concluded by 31 representatives, the Congress proceeded to discuss the second item on the agenda, a report by Voznesensky, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and Chairman of the State Planning Committee, on the state of the Soviet economy in 1940 and the development plan for the national economy in 1941. Voznesensky said that 1940 was a year of new progress for the Soviet Union. Neither the economic crisis in capitalist countries nor the imperialist war could prevent the development of the Soviet national economy. The Soviet economy is not affected by the current frenzy encountered by capitalist economies. Although the experience of this imperialist war is very important to us, technically and economically, the current imperialist war is a motor war. Motors require high technical standards, large quantities of oil, and non-ferrous metals. Regarding this aspect, the industry of the entire capitalist country is in adjustment. The current imperialist war is also a war of stockpiling. According to the war's sustainability, destructiveness, the collapse of the international small-capital system, and the distribution of labor, it shows the urgent need for stockpiling by the belligerent countries. The Soviet Union is paying close attention to the technical, economic, and other main points of this war and is taking appropriate steps to ensure that the national economy obtains advanced technology, and the country should also be in a state of preparation."

Making Military Supplies Without Spare Effort

Regarding the output of the Soviet Union and the United States, if the figures for both countries in 1929 were 100%, then the output of the United States in 1940 was 111%, while that of the Soviet Union was 534%. This is a typical example of the productive capacity of capitalism and socialism. The Soviet national economy has developed in all sectors. In the three years of the Third Five-Year Plan, the value of Soviet industrial products has increased from 95,500,000,000 rubles to 137,500,000 rubles, an increase of 44%. As for the output of the machinery manufacturing industry, it has also increased by 76%. As far as the national defense industry is concerned, no effort is spared in manufacturing aircraft, tanks, military supplies, and gunboats. (Omitted below) In short, the goals of the Soviet Union in 1941 are to: consolidate the independence of the Soviet national economy and avoid capitalist encirclement, so that it will not have to rely on capitalism economically (especially regarding machinery manufacturing and steel); continue to develop the socialist output of all sectors of the national economy; prevent uneven development of the national economy and possible failures caused by the development of new resources.

### Japanese Army Unable to Blockade Guangdong Province

Hong Kong: Several tanks and cavalry units have arrived in Nantou, proving that the Japanese army will have to garrison south of Danshui for some time. The number of Japanese warships along Dapeng Bay has increased to four, including one supply ship. It is reported that although the Hong Kong-Shaoguan highway has been closed, the cost of living in Shaoguan has not increased. The prices of motors, parts, gasoline, and oil may gradually increase in the future, but household appliances have not been affected. Although Japan has occupied the southern section of the Hong Kong-Shaoguan highway, it has not been able to completely blockade Guangdong Province, as there are other roads that can be used. Tungsten sand and tung oil, which were intended to be shipped to the United States via Daya Bay, are now being held in the interior, awaiting shipment. Chinese military authorities are still obtaining supplies of truck parts and gasoline via the Burma Road. It is said that this supply does not come from the Soviet Union.

### Overseas Japanese in Nanyang Discuss Situation in Shanghai: Australia Will Surely Assist Britain in Restraining Japan; 150 Japanese Nationals Evacuate to Return Home; Shanghai Japanese Newspaper Urges Residents to Prepare

The Japanese ship Kashima Maru set sail from Mumbai, India, on January 29, carrying over 150 Japanese passengers returning to Japan. Many of them were evacuating due to the perilous situation in the Pacific. On its way, it was inspected by British authorities in Singapore for about three hours on the 9th of this month. It then continued its voyage and arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 19th), docking at the Pujiang wharf. Among the passengers were Mr. Takayama Sataro, a trader from Manila; Mr. Ogata Hiroshi, a responsible officer of a rubber company in Nanyang; Mr. Mori Haruki, an official from the Japanese Consulate-General in Manila; and Mr. Ayao Tsutomu, an employee of Ishihara Sangyo in Singapore. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Kobe on the 21st.

Australian People Fully Support Britain

According to the English-language "China Press," a certain Japanese resident who studied at a school in Shanghai and has been doing business in Australia for three years, is now returning to Japan. He told reporters that neither Japan nor Australia would initiate a war against each other. However, if Britain goes to war with Japan, Australia will undoubtedly join the war. He left Australia on February 5 and traveled for a week in the Philippine Islands and the Dutch East Indies. He received fair treatment while traveling in the Philippines, but he felt unwelcome in the Dutch East Indies. The authorities there regarded and treated all Japanese residents as potential spies.

German Raider Engaged in Activity

Regarding the news of Nazi surface raiders operating in the Pacific, he heard from responsible parties before departing from Nanyang that a German surface raider shelled Nauru Island. The ship first flew the Japanese flag, but when it approached Nauru Island, it suddenly opened fire on several small ships in the harbor and then changed to the Nazi flag.

Australia Implements National Defense Training

As for Australia's attitude towards the European war, the Australian people are giving Britain their full support. However, Australia has not yet passed a conscription law to create an expeditionary force. Therefore, the Australian troops sent to Egypt, Palestine, and the Near East are all volunteers. At the same time, all Australian people are receiving national defense training, but the training period is only a few months, which is too short.

Entry of Japanese Nationals Now Extremely Strict

Since the outbreak of the European war, all communist organizations in Australia have been banned and are not allowed to hold meetings. Before this, communist groups in Australia were very active, but they suddenly disappeared after the German-Soviet pact was signed. Australia has tightened the enforcement of its immigration laws. Few Japanese people go to Australia unless they have direct trade relations with the country. According to current Australian law, Japanese people are not allowed to open stores or operate retail businesses in Australia.

Japanese Newspaper Believes Crisis is Imminent

Yesterday, the "Continental Daily News" published an article urging Japanese residents in Shanghai to make active preparations to deal with the current situation. The article was titled "Urging Local Residents to Make a Resolution." The gist of the article was that the four-nation conference of Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands held in Washington, and the evacuation of residents from various places in the Far East by Britain and the United States, indicate a looming storm. However, it is extremely difficult to find a direct cause for war in the concrete facts. This move by Britain and the United States is undoubtedly an attempt to intimidate Japan, but it is a misconception to try to stop Japan's southward advance in establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, Japan must inform Britain and the United States of this determination. Japan is determined to work for world peace until the very last moment of war, but it will never yield to the pressure of Britain and the United States. Japan is fully prepared domestically, so it is hoped that the Japanese community in Shanghai will exert all its efforts in the spirit of the new system to cope with the current situation.

Record of the Trial of the Fangdan Land Case

Barrister Bolland Mistakenly Quotes the Book of Songs as a Good Story

The case of four Chinese landowners suing the Municipal Council for the collection of Fangdan land tax continued to be heard at the Consular Court in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Those present included Mr. Lang, secretary of the Consular Court; the plaintiffs Fang Jiaping, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, and Fang Wende; the defense lawyers Liu Shifang and Wang Jian; and the Municipal Council's defense lawyers Bolland and Ru Baoyi. The hearing lasted about two hours and adjourned around 4:00 PM. The case was adjourned to next Tuesday (the 25th) for further hearing.

Barrister Bolland Mistakenly Quotes the Book of Songs

In fact, Ru Baoyi, the Municipal Council's defense lawyer, sat on the witness stand because he was called as a witness by Barrister Bolland at the previous hearing. He presented various Chinese land laws and the Great Qing Code as evidence. Therefore, after yesterday's hearing began, Barrister Liu Shifang also severely questioned the points made at the previous hearing. Mr. Liu claimed that Barrister Bolland, the defendant's defense lawyer, had quoted a sentence from the ancient Chinese book "Mencius," "All the land under heaven belongs to the Emperor," claiming that the land of the Chinese people was all leased from the Emperor. The people did not have land ownership, so they should pay rent and taxes. Therefore, regardless of whether it was Fangdan land or Daoqi land, they should pay rent and taxes to the authorities according to this example. This statement is a misunderstanding because the saying did not come from Mencius, but from the Book of Songs, and in terms of meaning, it does not mean that the Chinese people do not have land ownership. Mencius was merely quoting the Book of Songs at the time as an expression of indignation.

Daoqi and Fangdan Are Clearly Different

He continued, "(1) The Daoqi land held by foreigners is marked as a perpetual lease, while the land certificates held by the Chinese are marked with the words 'ownership,' which means that the Consular Court also noted the word 'ownership' on the Fangdan in the English record of the Municipal Council at the last hearing of this case. (2) Barrister Bolland said that in the announcement of Landao Tai on February 24, 1855, it stated that Chinese people who rented land and built houses in the concession area had to pay rent and taxes. This refers to Chinese people who rented land from private concessionaires and had to pay rent, and it does not mean that land rented from the Emperor had to pay rent, nor is it related to the Fangdan land that needs to pay rent. However, Judge Fei Tang mistakenly translated Landao Tai's distance from private land rent to the land lease regulations that require land tax to be paid."

Proving that Land Guards Are Civil Servants

Recalling the previous hearing, Ru Baoyi claimed that the land guards were bad people and not civil servants. However, the land guard position of Zhu Ruiqing, one of the plaintiffs, was indeed appointed by the Land Bureau and has a letter of appointment as proof. Even if the Municipal Council purchases real estate, it must be stamped by the land guard to take effect. It can be seen that his position is not as Ru Baoyi said. Furthermore, Ru Baoyi also said that according to the Great Qing Code, the transfer and inheritance of Fangdan land must be registered for transfer, but it is not known where this is stated in the Great Qing Code. In fact, most of the Fangdan currently held were issued during the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty. Since no new Fangdan has been issued, there is naturally no need to register the transfer during transfer and inheritance.

### Splitting Fangdan Does Not Violate the Law

As for Ru Baoyi's claim that splitting the Fangdan is illegal, this is also incorrect. A photograph of a split Fangdan appears in the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau's annual publication of the Republic of China in 1928, with a note below stating, "This is a split single. When the people sell a portion of the land on the original single, they cut off half or a corner of the single and hand it over to the owner to hold as proof of business." At the time, Barrister Liu also presented a copy of the Shanghai Special Municipality's municipal regulations and pointed out that Article 6 of the rules for the issuance of business licenses by the Shanghai Special Municipality Land Bureau, approved on July 3, 1929, states, "For old field singles that have been cut or divided, after verification, the hill number shall be assigned separately," which is proof that Fangdan can be split.

When Barrister Liu spoke eloquently in court, Barrister Bolland, the Municipal Council's defense lawyer, frequently tried to stop him from speaking, but Judge Lang allowed Mr. Liu to continue speaking without interruption until the court adjourned at 4:00 PM. Barrister Ru Baoyi did not offer any rebuttal from the start of the hearing to the adjournment.

Western Residents Advocate Fair Taxation

British resident Liddell wrote to the North-China Daily News yesterday, criticizing the current tax system of the Municipal Council, stating, in brief, that when Barrister Bolland, the Municipal Council's defense lawyer, defended the Municipal Council in the Consular Court's trial of the "Fangdan Land Case," he said that taxpayers should fairly bear taxes for the benefit of society and strongly criticized "the injustice of privileged classes being exempt from rent." The Municipal Council cannot tolerate such unfair facts. Bolland's words are very suitable for Fangdan land, why are they not suitable for owner-occupied land? I believe that the Municipal Council's Tax System Improvement Committee should pay close attention to this. The Fangdan case is of great importance. If the Municipal Council wins the case, its annual income can increase by more than one million yuan.

### A Small Number of American Missionaries Prepare to Return Home

According to the Continental Daily News, the rumor that a large number of American missionaries will leave China is confirmed to be untrue. According to sources revealed by the authorities yesterday, only about 25 percent of American missionaries are preparing to return home in accordance with the State Department's advice, and about 5 percent will evacuate by the end of April. It is said that each of these missionaries can receive a considerable travel subsidy. Usually, about 20 percent of American missionaries return home on leave. According to a survey conducted this month (covering about 60 percent of church personnel in China), as of October 1, 1940, there were a total of 1,483 American missionaries in China. Since the U.S. announced the evacuation of nationals last year, about 329 people have left China as of February 10 this year. There are currently 1,154 missionaries remaining in China, and about 75 will leave China by the end of April, accounting for about 5 percent of the total. They are now preparing their luggage and waiting for ships to return home. It is estimated that there are about 329 American missionaries in the coastal areas of China, most of whom are in Japanese-occupied areas. Very few American missionaries are evacuating from Free China. There are about 200 missionaries in the interior of China, and only eight had left their posts as of February 10, some of whom had reached retirement age. When the State Department advised nationals to return home, six Presbyterian missionaries and one "American Church" missionary continued to serve as usual, even while on leave.

### "Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch" Was Bombed Yesterday; Three People Threw Four Bombs, One Exploded; Bodyguard Zhao Wanjun Shot in the Head and Killed

Yesterday morning, the "Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch" at No. 15 Bund, Public Concession, was suddenly bombed. A total of four bombs were thrown, only one of which exploded. The bombers also opened fire with pistols near the stairs, resulting in the death of one bodyguard from a gunshot wound. In addition, one employee was cut in the face by shattered glass. The details of the case are described below.

Three Men Rush In and Throw Bombs

At around 10:15 AM yesterday, three middle-aged men suddenly entered the "Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch" at No. 15 Bund, Public Concession, one after another. One of them, dressed in a Western suit, drew out two grenades and threw them inside. One fell on the right side of the passageway inside the gate and did not explode, while the other fell at the entrance of the stairs and exploded immediately, causing damage to the walls and glass in many places. The staff in the counter were shocked at the time and fell to the ground, afraid to move.

Four Shots Fired, Bodyguard Killed

At the same time, another man went straight to the second floor and threw two military grenades. Because the fuses were not pulled, they did not explode when they landed. The man then turned around and went downstairs, where he met Zhao Wanjun (28 years old), a bodyguard from Zhenjiang, near the stairs. Zhao tried to stop him, but the man pulled out a pistol and fired four shots at Zhao. One bullet hit Zhao's head, penetrating his temple into his brain, and another bullet hit his chest. He immediately fell to the stairs.

Amidst the Chaos, Three People Escape

After the grenade throwers met, they discarded their weapons and escaped without a trace in the chaos. More than 30 Japanese military police stationed in the adjacent Bank of Communications also mobilized to guard the area. At the same time, police vehicles and a large number of Chinese and Western detectives dispatched by the police also rushed to the scene of the incident and cut off traffic in the surrounding area for a thorough search, but to no avail. The bodyguard Zhao Wanjun was sent to Renji Hospital, but he died before arriving at the hospital due to the critical gunshot wound. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. When one bomb exploded at the entrance of the stairs, all the glass windows were shattered, causing glass shards to cut the face of employee Xue Hong, but he was not seriously injured. The police have summoned the male and female staff of the "Bank" for questioning and have taken the seized pistols and unexploded grenades back for inspection.

### U.S. Ship Chaumont Returned Home Yesterday Morning

Mooring Time in Shanghai Less Than 24 Hours This Time

The U.S. Navy's 10,000-ton transport ship Chaumont, shortened its mooring time in Shanghai to less than 24 hours this time (this is the shortest time for a U.S. transport ship to moor in Shanghai), and left the British Navy pontoon in the Pujiang River slowly yesterday morning (the 20th) to return to the United States. About 105 U.S. Marine Corps members of the Fourth Marine Regiment, whose service in Shanghai has expired, all took the ship back to various ports on the east and west coasts of the United States. In addition, about 150 U.S. Marine Corps members stationed in Tianjin and Beijing, whose service in North China has expired, and U.S. Asian Fleet personnel whose service in the East has ended, also took the ship. The Chaumont will sail back to the United States via Manila, Guam, and Honolulu. Previously, U.S. transport ships would always stop in Shanghai twice each time they came to Asia. The first time was on the way from Manila to Qinhuangdao, stopping briefly at Wusongkou or Shanghai so that the personnel on board could disembark, and then proceeding to Qinhuangdao or Qingdao and Yantai as usual. On the way back, they would stop in Shanghai for about ten days, allowing the crew to disembark and enjoy themselves for a few days before crossing the Pacific back to the United States. However, this time the Chaumont did not follow this practice, but sailed directly from Manila to Qinhuangdao, and stopped briefly in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday on the way back.

### Imported Rice Arrives in Increasing Amounts, Rice Prices Rise

Someone Is Manipulating Behind the Scenes, Which Cannot Be Explained by Common Sense

Today, due to the turmoil in the Pacific, rice merchants have taken the opportunity to stir up trouble, causing rice prices to exceed limits, making it more difficult for ordinary people to make a living. This week, imported rice has been arriving in Shanghai continuously. Yesterday, the market blindly raised rice prices by several cents because of rumors that a ship carrying flour from Australia was blocked in Hong Kong. The ship was carrying flour, so even if it was detained, what does it have to do with rice prices? Such illegal manipulation and monopoly is hated by all people. No wonder there are complaints from the outside about the fact that the price limit is getting higher and higher, and the rice arrivals are increasing, but the rice prices are rising, believing that it is a breach of trust. Yesterday, a Japanese ship, Blyo Maru, arrived directly from Yangon with more than 70,000 bags of rice, managed by Yamashita Kisen Co. It arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and stopped at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to unload. From Monday to Wednesday this week, a total of 63,732 bags of imported rice arrived in three days. Including the 70,000 bags of rice brought by the Japanese ship yesterday, the total is a huge 133,732 bags. It is said that a large amount of rice will arrive in Shanghai in the coming days. Considering the prosperous source of imported rice, the rice price should not rise.

### Municipal Council's Japanese Deputy Secretary-General Teraoka Succeeds

Municipal Council's Japanese Deputy Secretary-General Hideshiko Yubisuku is scheduled to retire at the end of this month. Secretary-General Philip held a farewell banquet for him at the Shanghai Club the night before last. As for the successor, Teraoka Kesshei, who works at the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai and was recommended by the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai, has been officially announced at noon yesterday. The Municipal Council has made a decision. Teraoka graduated from the Political Department of Tokyo University and then entered the Europe and America Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He has served in the Japanese embassies in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany. He was transferred to the Shanghai Consulate-General in August last year. It is now said that Hideshiko Yubisuku, the outgoing Japanese Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, believes that Teraoka has been in Shanghai for a short time and is unfamiliar with many of the Municipal Council's staff. He is scheduled to host a banquet for the important officials of the Municipal Council at the Hongkou Japanese Club at 6:00 PM on the 25th of this month to introduce Teraoka.

### Measures to Suppress Hoarding Have Been Ordered by the Ministry

The National Government has promulgated measures to suppress hoarding, a total of 26 articles, which list the types of important daily necessities in detail and strictly stipulate the measures for punishment and reward for reporting. It is said that the relevant authorities in Shanghai have recently received the ministry's order to implement it earnestly. Ordinary legitimate merchants have expressed their support, but they hope that the government will clearly distinguish the limits of hoarding when actually applying these measures, and pay special attention to rewarding legitimate merchants in the crackdown on speculation, so as to ensure an uninterrupted source of goods. Those who are found to have solid evidence of hoarding should be severely punished in accordance with the promulgated measures.

### Dutch Ship Chizharlinka Will Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

The Java Mailboat Company's new mailboat Chizharlinka has already passed through Hong Kong and is coming to Shanghai, and will arrive at the port tomorrow (the 22nd). The Royal Company's South African line Tegel berg vessel has also sailed north and is expected to arrive at the port next Thursday or Friday.

### A Humble Opinion on the Urgent Need to Improve the Current Situation of the Public Concession (I)

— Nash

Mr. Nash, the Acting Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, has served in the Bureau for 25 years and has recently resigned from the Bureau and is about to leave Shanghai. Based on his past experience and the current situation, he published an article in his personal capacity entitled "Humble Opinion on the Urgent Need to Improve the Shanghai Public Concession," which is a famous work after the "Fei Tang Report." It is now translated by the Dazhong News Agency and published in sections. Mr. Nash will leave Shanghai and return to China on the 25th of this month. We express our infinite admiration for his parting words. We wish Mr. Nash a happy future.

Although I advocate attaching importance to the strength of the sovereign powers of various countries in the Public Concession and their accurate historical estimates, the current happiness of the Public Concession is based on the independence of municipal policies and separation from the national policies of the countries concerned. This statement may seem self-contradictory at first hearing.

Ten Years of Tranquility

Since China was defeated militarily and politically by Britain in 1840, and British settlements were established until the First World War, the greatest power in the Public Concession was in the hands of Britain and the United States. From 1914 to 1925, Britain was weakened by the European War, and its control over the Public Concession was slightly weakened. At the same time, Japan's naval power in the Western Pacific expanded due to the opportunity of the European War, and its political power in China also increased. The United States, adhering to the policies of the Liberal Party and the Isolationists, tried to mitigate Japan's power and maintain the status quo, as shown in the Washington Treaty of 1922 and the liberal policy reported by Shidehara in China. All of this changed the control of the Public Concession. From 1914 to 1925, Britain's fatigue after the war, the United States' indifference, Japan's acquiescence, and China's powerlessness were enough to explain the interaction of various countries' policies in China, and the Shanghai Public Concession was the focus. These policies canceled each other out and maintained a balance, which finally enabled our municipal life to achieve ten years of tranquility.

Legitimate Aspirations

China's lack of power and influence in the municipal life of the Shanghai Public Concession came to an end in 1925, replaced by the power of the National Revolution, insisting that the Public Concession was a part of Chinese territory, and that its municipal life must conform to the national aspirations and speeches of the Chinese people, and that the Chinese people must not always be in a passive position. In the five years that followed, the trend of British and American policies in China, especially in the Shanghai Public Concession, was, as Chamberlain said in his Christmas memorandum in 1926, to constantly concede to China's legitimate aspirations. In the Public Concession, these aspirations are not consistent with traditional municipal policies and customs, and the method proposed by Judge Fei Tang is to translate this inconsistency into future harmonious Sino-foreign relations, through the "transitional era" and finally the "return of the concession" period.

Fei Tang Report

What the British and American expatriates in the Shanghai Public Concession considered "absurd" from 1925 to 1930 unexpectedly became a historical fact of the British and American governments' policies in China. The recommendations made by the Fei Tang Report regarding the improvement of the Shanghai Public Concession used this policy as a tool to revise the Yangjingbang land regulations, which were previously considered to be related to China's weakness, so that China would have a gradually increasing and ultimately surpassing power in all aspects of the municipal life goals and municipal policies of the Public Concession. Although the expatriates in Shanghai expressed an uncompromising attitude, the British and American governments had actually formulated this policy. The governments recognized the National Government established in Nanjing in 1928 as a progressive government in China, and the most enthusiastic political and commercial relations had developed between Britain and the United States. Such a government should be given the right to vote to Chinese citizens in the civil concession after preparing to abolish the consular jurisdiction treaty. For the sake of fairness, the municipal life of the Public Concession should have the greatest power occupied by the Chinese.

Different Policies

This is the policy of Britain and the United States, and this policy is very different from Japan's imperial policy. Japan believes that the legitimacy of China's national aspirations has not yet reached its time, and Japan's military power has greatly increased due to the opportunity of the world war. Some expatriates in Shanghai thought that Japan's purpose in China was the same as that of Britain and the United States, but this is a big mistake. Basically, Japan wants to make Britain and the United States submit to Japanese power in the Far East, and also make China do so. Japan and China are brothers in Asia, and Japan implicitly regards itself as the eldest brother. Japan's intention to call China brothers is to make Europe and the United States have no foothold in East Asia. Japan wants to see China strong in order to help it exclude Europe and the United States, but it does not want China to be too strong, lest Japan itself also be excluded.

Japan Concedes

From the Washington Treaty of 1923 to the Japanese army's invasion of Northeast China in 1931, Japan's concessions during this decade were only temporary. In fact, what represented Japan's diplomatic policy in China was Tanaka's "active" action, not Bihara's passive acquiescence. Although Japan made concessions in the Washington Treaty to maintain the balance of power of the British and American navies in the Western Pacific and the Chinese coast, it was not enough to represent the true spirit of Japan's foreign policy. To know the true face of Japan's foreign policy, it can be seen in the following event; that is, at that time, when the Western countries were engaged in the Great War, Japan put forward "21 Articles" of requirements to China, intending to swallow China in one go.

Excluding Europe and the West

I should insert a word here, that is, the purpose of this article is not to condemn the diplomatic policies of Japan or any country. I am only using objective facts to explain the inevitability of Japan's dual goals, that is, Japan wants to control China in its "geographical scope," while excluding the power of European and Western countries. Therefore, although Japan allows the powers to concede to China's legitimate aspirations and recognizes itself as neutral and reasonable, it sees its own role differently. Therefore, in the Shanghai Public Concession, where the elite of China gathers, Japan witnessed that the status of British and American rule gradually progressed to the power of the Chinese people, and could not help but be jealous, thinking that China's power would surpass Japan. In order to carry out its dual goals of simultaneously weakening the power of the powers and China, Japan at that time severely criticized the tolerance policy of the British and American policy towards China, believing that this policy violated the traditional policy of the Public Concession.

### American Sails Small Yacht Across the Pacific Ocean: Journey from Shanghai to America Expected to Take Three Months; Sufficient Food for Half a Year Stored on Board

The Continental Daily News reports: Mr. Scheffer, a senior crew member of the American President Lines and a native of San Francisco, California, is fond of adventure. Last June, he designed and built a small yacht in Hong Kong, named "Cynjo." Accompanied by his wife and brother-in-law, he sailed the yacht from Hong Kong to Taiwan. In November, Mr. and Mrs. Scheffer arrived in Shanghai, preparing to sail the yacht across the Pacific Ocean. Yesterday (19th), Mr. Scheffer stated that he and his wife plan to lead a crew of four, setting sail from Shanghai within the month, taking the route through Honolulu to America. The journey is expected to take three months, but the yacht is stocked with enough food for half a year, and there are facilities for collecting rainwater to supplement the fresh water supply. The "Cynjo" is made of hardwood, 40 feet long, 25 tons in weight, with two sails totaling 1,100 square feet in area, two masts 58 feet and 48 feet long, and equipped with an auxiliary gasoline engine for use in ports and during departure.

### Shi Guqi Robbery Case: Bandit Leader Killed

More than Ten Accomplices Arrested; Interrogation; Remanded for Further Investigation

The Shi Guqi antique shop at 70 Jiaotong Road was burglarized and robbed of antiques and cash worth approximately 200,000 yuan a few days ago. However, after the incident, Chief Detective Jiang Shangpei and Detective Ren Fengbiao of the Central Police Department obtained clues and arrested Sun Liansheng, Zhang Rongsheng, Shan Xiaoxin, Huang Daxing, Tang Jinpei, Liu Botang, Song Xueren, Jiang Weihuai, Hong Afu, Cheng Ruiting, Lu Linquan, Chen Guiqing, Chen Lu, Wu Yiren and others involved in the case at various locations, including Room 520 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road (the main culprit was at large at the time, so the information was not released). It has now been determined that the main culprit in this case, Zhang Xiong from Zhejiang, passed by the Da Guangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday morning. Officers waited for him, and when Zhang arrived, they approached and arrested him. Zhang resisted and was shot and captured by the detective. Yesterday morning, Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police department, informed the First Special Court that the suspect Zhang was in the hospital and could not be brought to court, requesting permission to remand him in custody for a joint trial with Sun Liansheng and others. Judge Feng granted the request.

Furthermore, it was reported that at 10:05 a.m. the day before yesterday, near the Da Guangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road, the bandit leader of the Shi Guqi robbery case, using the alias Zhong Yongquan, was loitering in front of the cinema. He was ordered to stop by Detective No. 203 of the Central Police Department, but he refused. The detective fired a shot, hitting him in the chest, and he fell to the ground and was captured. He was immediately taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the bandit died yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. due to the vital injury caused by the bullet.

### Meng Jiangnu Film Lawsuit: Appeal Judgement Yesterday

Liu Zhonghao of Guohua Film Company previously entrusted Zhang Niankun as the company's representative to distribute films such as "Meng Jiangnu" in South China. Later, due to disputes over accounts, both parties filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court. The court ruled that Guohua should repay Zhang Niankun 1,800 yuan in national currency and 482.34 Hong Kong dollars, and confirmed that Zhang Niankun had a lien on the films "Meng Jiangnu," "Romantic Ghost," "Li Sanniang," and "New Hell" produced by the company. Both parties expressed dissatisfaction with the judgement. Zhang appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, engaging lawyers Lu Jun and Tang Juexian. Guohua Company also engaged lawyer Feng Xizui to appeal. The High Court found the case to involve complex and confusing accounts, and after several months of investigation, the case was finally concluded. Yesterday afternoon, the court ruled to modify the portion of the judgment regarding Guohua's repayment of 1,800 yuan in national currency to Zhang Niankun, ordering Guohua to repay Zhang Niankun 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. The appeals of Zhang Niankun and Guohua Company were otherwise dismissed.

### Peng Bowei Dies Yesterday

Peng Bowei, an elderly Hunan man in his sixties, residing at 44 Le'an Lane, Avenue Joffre, was shot by thugs near the intersection of Rue Tenant de la Tour and Avenue du Roi Albert in the French Concession at 6:00 p.m. on the 17th of this month. He was shot in the back, and the assailants fled the scene. The French police sent Peng to Guangci Hospital for treatment while ordering detectives to investigate and arrest the fugitives. These details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after Peng was admitted to the hospital, doctors performed surgery to remove the bullet. Unfortunately, his condition deteriorated, and he died yesterday at noon. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the morgue in the small ward of Taile Sidal Road. The police also notified the family, who claimed the body at 3:00 p.m. that afternoon and took it to the funeral home for embalming. The police are still diligently investigating the assailants.

### Wuhe Weaving Factory: Labor Dispute Resolved

The 300 to 400 employees of the Wuhe Weaving Factory at 120 Route Lafayette in the French Concession and the Jin Situ Temple branch factory on Connaught Road in the British Concession went on strike on the 19th because their request for an increase in the monthly rice subsidy was not met. According to a report from a Dagang News reporter yesterday, labor and management negotiated at the main factory on Route Lafayette at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. With the agreement of both parties, the rice subsidy was increased from 10 yuan to 14 yuan per month. Therefore, the labor dispute has been completely resolved, and all workers will resume work this morning.

### Bandit Chen Qilin and Others: Committed Eight Kidnappings; Also Committed Multiple Robberies; Police Request Severe Punishment According to Law

Business News

### Finance: US Dollar Still Flowing Out; Market Fluctuations Remain Stable

In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. Although the off-market prices for GBP/USD were flat, the trend remained weak. Speculators sold off approximately one million US dollars after making some purchases in the morning. The trading price for US dollars was mostly 5.65625 yuan in the morning, reaching 5.71875 yuan in the afternoon. Before the evening close, news of a non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union was reported, leading to varied speculation. The market saw a return to stability, and both GBP/USD closed flat. Only the forward US dollar strengthened by 0.03125. Based on the foreign exchange market situation, it is currently in a state of fluctuation. However, Corley's trip to Chengdu and his imminent return to the US will be beneficial and harmless to the Chinese foreign exchange market. The British pound has lost its importance in Shanghai's market compared to the US dollar. Therefore, only the US dollar saw inflows and outflows. Moreover, savings deposits in US dollars not only do not earn interest, but may also require depositors to pay handling fees. In short, this action will not be detrimental to US dollar depositors.

US Dollar Fluctuates Slightly

Initially, long and short-term London exchange rates both rose by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and the London gold price was stable. Foreign exchange rates between GBP/USD and Shanghai were flat. USD fell by 0.025 against GBP, slightly against Shanghai by 0.08 points, and there was no trading against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the bank's opening this morning, the spot selling price was 3 pence 4.46875 for GBP and 5.65625 yuan for USD, which was flat for GBP and down 0.03125 for USD compared to the previous day's evening close. After opening, speculators bought slightly, but foreign banks supplied generously, so the market was firm. The settlement price for US dollars for this month for speculators was 5.65625 yuan, and for February it was 5.59375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax increased by 0.50%. Afterwards, market sentiment suddenly loosened due to a bomb somewhere. Speculators switched from buying to selling, selling to an American bank. The US dollar price for next month was quoted at 5.65625 yuan, and for this month it reached 5.6875 yuan. However, by noon, the selling pressure had subsided, and the market returned to stability. The closing price for spot US dollars was 5.65625 yuan, and for GBP it was 3 pence 4.453125. The initial outlook for the market showed no major changes. It was reported that Huaxing Shanghai had paid American banks for US dollars for this month at a price of 5.65625 yuan. Soon after, speculators began to sell aggressively, and there were many negative rumors, so the February US dollar reached 5.71875 yuan, and the March US dollar also traded at 5.6875 yuan. Before the close, there were rumors of a treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, which caused the market to recover slightly. As a result, the spot and current month's US dollar closed at 5.6875 yuan, GBP at 3 pence 4.46875, and the next month's US dollar at 5.65625 yuan. GBP at 3 pence 4.45125, with no difference between the spot and forward GBP rates compared to the previous day, and only a 0.03125 increase in the forward US dollar.

Hong Kong Exchange Rate Fluctuates

The spot Shanghai dollar rose by 2.5 yuan to 434 yuan. At 11:30 a.m., the spot Shanghai dollar fell back by 1 yuan to 433 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged.

Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Falls Slightly

Tianjin, 20th (Thursday) - The exchange market opened sluggish this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate remained unchanged, still opening at 3 pence 8.8125. The renewal telegraphic transfer rate was 0.0625 higher at 6.25 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 0.25 yuan to 90.05 yuan. The "Joint Note" off-market price rose slightly by 0.1 yuan to 81 yuan.

### Gold Market Tries to Rise but Falters; Spot Price Raises Around 400 Yuan

Haxia off-market trading has made buyers even less interested. The early morning rise had reached 6,170 yuan, but later it went downwards, hovering between 6,000 yuan and 6,100 yuan. There was a risk of re-entering the 6,000 yuan mark. The offshore market after the previous day's close was very expensive, so the opening price was 6,000 yuan. However, after the "Reserve Branch" was bombed, market sentiment fell, and Gonghe, Chengji, De and other companies aggressively sold, falling back to 6,020 yuan. By the time the market closed at noon, it was still 6,082 yuan. The market once hardened to 6,100 yuan, but when new Fengyong, Ren Chengyong, and Mingfeng came to sell due to the continuing rise of foreign exchange rates, it fell to 6,010 yuan. The closing result was 6,035 yuan, down 50 yuan from the previous day. The current market spot price was 420 yuan higher than the futures price in the morning. It was heard that transactions at 380 yuan had occurred in the afternoon. The total daily transaction was about 10,000 taels. The price of silverware stabilized, and the price of Guan Jin etc. was flat.

Haxia Falls 50 Yuan

The offshore market insisted after the previous day's late close. Although various parties had no intention of buying more, the selling had stopped. Therefore, the opening price was 6,120 yuan, 35 yuan higher than the previous day. The market was quite active after the opening, and the buying was very strong, continuing to rise and reaching 6,170 yuan. After the aforementioned incident was reported, market sentiment relaxed imperceptibly, and it was considered a selling opportunity. At one time, there was a wave of selling, with Gonghe, Chengji, and Defu being the most active sellers. Although other silver companies absorbed some, they were ultimately unable to resist the crowd and fell to 6,020 yuan. At that time, there was concern that it might enter the 6,000 yuan mark, but Da Feng, Hesheng, and others vigorously bought to stop the decline and rose back to 6,100 yuan. However, the silver companies turned to selling again, and Tong Kangyong and others came to sell, causing the market to fall back to 6,035 yuan. At this time, Da Feng, Hengji, and others suddenly had the intention to buy, and took the opportunity to search and buy at a low price, pulling it up 40-50 yuan. The market closed at 6,090 yuan before the close, and the final result was 6,082 yuan, down 50 yuan from the previous day. There were many customers limiting the price in the afternoon, so it was pressed to 6,050 yuan. However, it hardened, and Hesheng, Yida, Tong Kangyong and others were willing to buy, pushing it to 6,100 yuan. However, the foreign exchange rate was reported to be rising, so the selling pressure rose sharply. New Fengyong, Ren Chengyong, Mingfeng, and others sold a lot, and it actually fell to 6,010 yuan. Because retail investors held on, the closing was still at 6,035 yuan, down 50 yuan from the previous day. The daily fluctuation was 160 yuan. The selling price of the current brand gold of the cash shop was more than ten yuan higher than Haxia (spot), and the purchase price was forty yuan lower. The current standard gold was lower than the listed price by fifty to sixty yuan, and the transactions were rarely opened.

Silverware Returns After Rising

The selling price of silverware and jewelry was listed at 670 yuan per tael at 9:25 a.m., and then fell by 10 yuan at 11:20 a.m., and remained unchanged thereafter. It is estimated that Datonghang, Xinhang, and others have all suspended 660 yuan, and the purchase is about 40 yuan lower.

### Foreign Currency Still in High Demand

In yesterday's foreign currency market, although Haxia market prices were weak, the prices of British and American gold pounds rose because of the high cash price, while the price of British gold notes remained stable. The market price of US dollar notes initially reached 17.55 yuan, but eventually fell to 17.3 yuan, down 0.1 yuan from the previous day. The supply of Hong Kong notes was abundant, and the market price was weak. There was demand for Singapore notes and Annam, Roby, and Philippines notes, and the market prices all rose uniformly. The supply and demand for Japanese and Korean gold notes was equal, and the market price was stable. The former remained at 1.74 yuan, and the latter remained at 1.35 yuan.

### Oil Market: Oilcake Manipulation Has Many Twists and Turns

The oilcake market yesterday was still within the scope of speculation, but its excitement has slightly reduced. However, the trend of the day had many twists and turns. Previously, the market price rose wave after wave in a tense atmosphere, but later the selling pressure turned strong, and it was a downward trend. In short, those who make a fortune from national difficulties all take the purpose of getting the money. Therefore, its changes are even more profound. Yesterday, the result was that current soybean oil rose slightly by 0.25 yuan, peanut oil rose by 0.5 yuan, and peanut oil fell by 2 yuan. A Hong Kong comprador went to Jiaozhou for 1,200 pieces at a price of 105 yuan. Soybean oil only opened 180 barrels of Dalian current oil and 700-800 barrels of futures oil. Soybean cake inland and Hong Kong compradors went to current cake for more than 5,000 pieces, and other futures cake totaled about 40,000 pieces. The market price rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. On the 21st, 555 bags of soybeans were exported to Xiamen, 1,025 bags to Hong Kong, 3,440 bags to Singapore, 6,000 pieces of soybean cake to Xiamen, 1,800 pieces to Hong Kong, 100 bags of peanuts to Singapore, 310 tins of sesame oil to Xiamen, and 630 tins to Hong Kong.

### North-South Goods: Miscellaneous Litchi Weak

Although the arrival of miscellaneous litchi in the market is scarce, the market stock is still not thin. Therefore, the trend is very weak. In addition, the sales of each helper are narrow, making it more difficult to turn around. Therefore, the recent market price has dropped by 5-10 yuan. Only the sales in Hangzhou are more active.

### Cinchona Tree

By Gao Jiannong

The Cinchona tree is a tall, evergreen tree about seventy to eighty feet high on the Le Quinqui Mountains. Its leaves are ovate, opposite, and glossy. It bears small white flowers with tubular corollas in conical panicles. Its bark contains a white, needle-like crystal with an extremely bitter taste and is an effective treatment for malaria. This is where the medicinal name Cinchona "frost" comes from. The name cinchona is derived from the native South American word for "skin of skin." Its Latin name is Cinchona, named after the Countess Cinchone, wife of the Viceroy of Peru. The Countess contracted malaria in Peru in the early seventeenth century. Following the advice of a Jesuit priest, she took the so-called "Jesuit powder" and made a complete recovery. This powder was made from the bark of the Cinchona tree. The Countess returned to her home country of Spain in 1632 and brought the Cinchona medicine to Europe for the first time. People named the medicine after her name. (To be continued)

### Grain: Over 70,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai; Forward Contract Traders and Hoarders Still Dominate the Market

A large batch of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Blyo Marn of the Japanese shipping company Yamashita Kisen Kaisha has brought over 70,000 bags of foreign rice from Yangon (yesterday's report incorrectly stated Saigon). It has arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is unloading at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong. It is said that a large shipment will arrive within a few days.

Foreign rice was seen to be strong yesterday morning. Since new forward contracts have not yet arrived, the forward contracts that have been negotiated in recent days are difficult to confirm. It is also rumored that one or two batches have been cancelled due to a lack of ships. Therefore, although the market has lacked stimulus due to the easing of international tensions, the excitement of buying has not diminished. Moreover, since general high-quality goods have already reached the price limit and the authorities are strictly limiting prices, those who hold goods are unwilling to sell when they hear that the Hong Kong telegraphic rate is rising. As a result, high-quality goods are scarce in the market. Under the lack of goods available for purchase, general customers have turned their attention to mid-grade goods. At one time, the sales of mid-grade goods became brisk, and sellers took the opportunity to push up prices. The market became tighter than before. The situation did not diminish until the close, and the closing price was again raised by one yuan. The first grade West Guanzhong was 85-84.5 yuan, the second grade was 80 yuan, the first grade Siamese was 85 yuan, the next was 83 yuan, the fire-roasted was 84 yuan, the small roasted was 76 yuan, the rice was 73 yuan, and the broken tip was 67-64.5 yuan. Forward contracts also took the opportunity to push up prices, so the forward contracts for each month were raised by 0.5-1 yuan. The first grade Saigon February-March opened at 96.5 yuan, and the forward contracts were 98-98.35 yuan. The current small roasted rice was 90.05 yuan, 91 yuan, and 91.5 yuan, and February was 88 yuan, 88.35 yuan, and 89.1 yuan. The lower part of February to the beginning of March was 89-89.5 yuan. There were also 600-700 tons of transactions. Over 10,000 bags of current rice were opened.

Due to sunny weather, the source of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice continues to flow in, resulting in oversupply. The selling price continues to depreciate by 0.5 yuan. Kunshan Yuanjing opened at 107.5-107 yuan, and the price of Hejian was 103.5-102 yuan. Qingjiao Baodao Hejian was 99.5-99 yuan.

With major companies hoarding, the sales of glutinous rice have become smooth, and the market price has risen by 0.5 yuan along with the foreign rice due to the small amount of rice on the market. Hong Kong special was opened at 83.5 yuan, and ordinary was 82.5 yuan.

### Flour Market Remains Tense

The flour market did not escape the tense situation yesterday. Although the flour companies and warehouses have supplies, they cannot be cashed out immediately. Therefore, the demand for foreign flour is still urgent. Moreover, in the high rice price environment, speculators and hoarders all have unexpected desires. The total market price for Linglou brand flour was 25.55 yuan, and for Jinlong brand flour was 24.5 yuan. About 10,000 bags were transacted. It is said that there are still 300,000-400,000 bags of foreign flour on the way, which will arrive at the end of the month and the beginning of the month. However, there are frequent obstacles along the way at present, and there is a risk of interruption at any time, so the market is still strong.

The source of wheat is still quiet. The foreign wheat ships have been damaged on the way and will be delayed for another week or ten days. The price of domestic Du wheat is also high, and few goods arrive. Although the factories have a strong need for raw materials, they regret that there are no goods to buy. It is said that the price of wheat in the concession is approaching 40 yuan, with dozens of bags being sold by this street office. The rest of the trading is as usual.

### Securities: Government Bonds Have Buying Interest

The off-market price of government bonds continued to advance yesterday. The buyers were all strong and still interested in buying. For example, Xinfu Company has been buying continuously for many days and still has no intention of stopping. Maoda's buying is another new force. At this price, there must be an organization, and a huge change in the future is inevitable. However, only raising the price of Class C bonds shows a weakness. Let's see what happens later. Yesterday morning, Xinfu alone entered more than 400,000, and Lianhe, Hongda, Yongkang, Tongsheng and other companies also bought a lot. Tongkang has already been released, and Dade and Hengfu have also sold a lot. Xinfu raised the opening price to 66 yuan, fearing that it might fall. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to drag another 200,000-300,000, and Hengkang followed suit. The opening price was once raised to over 6 yuan. Hongda, Tongkang, and Hengfu sold, and it once fell back to 5.7 yuan. Near the close, Maoda suddenly had an appetite for 300,000, and the market price was raised to over 6 yuan again. At that time, the sellers were only Lianyi, Yizhong, Lianhe and Shengchang, which were not enough to resist. Therefore, the resulting increase was not uniform. Most rose by 0.5-0.8 yuan, while Class C bonds alone rose by 1.05 yuan, indicating that the price increase was only focused on one type. The turnover was about 2.5-2.6 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

The transaction of 30 shares of Sanyou Industrial Society shares was transacted at a price of 24 yuan.

London, 19th (Wednesday) - Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debts and Far East company stocks remained flat. Only the price of the Mercantile Bank shares fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence to £7 and 15 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton Flowers: Cotton Yarn Falls and Rises; Cotton is Not in Demand

The yarn market continues to see increases, but the trend is still uncertain. This is because people are unsettled, and speculators are constantly entering and exiting the market with large sums, causing fluctuations. Actual sales have improved slightly, but large transactions are still hindered by transportation difficulties and inability to purchase in bulk. 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 1,298 yuan at its highest and 1,255 yuan at its lowest. In the afternoon, it started at 1,268 yuan, fell to 1,264 yuan, and ended at 1,266 yuan. Today, 1,040 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the strong momentum from the previous afternoon. There were more buyers than sellers in the market, creating a tight situation. The initial price was 1,280 yuan, rising slightly to 1,283 yuan. Bull traders then sold, causing the price to fall to 1,271 yuan. At this point, smaller companies entered the market, driving the price up to 1,298 yuan. However, as the price rose, rumors spread, and the bid price suddenly dropped by 100 yuan. This triggered a sharp decline in the market, with shouts of selling echoing. The price plummeted to 1,255 yuan. Subsequently, those who had profited covered their positions, pushing the price back up to 1,274 yuan. The closing price was 1,268 yuan. The total transaction volume for the half-day was 9,150 bales. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below:

Hong Kong: 475 bales; Inland: 5 bales

Ningbo: 12 bales; Fellow Traders: 7,650 bales

Total: 9,150 bales

The current cotton situation is relatively quiet because the yarn market is more stable, but demand from factories is weak, so the overall trend remains flat.

New York cotton cloth market conditions are quiet and mixed. Due to buying by fellow traders and short covering, prices suddenly rose. As a result, the closing prices were higher than the previous day by up to eight points. Indian cotton was slightly weak, with predictions of a decline.

Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was generally quiet. Because the yarn market seemed to be firming and foreign exchange rates were stabilizing, there were a few spot cotton transactions yesterday.

### Piece Goods: Speculative Market Causes Disorder in the Cloth Market

The cloth market yesterday was stable, because actual transactions were sluggish. Inventories of cotton cloth are too high, and sentiment is weak, so sellers are unable to raise prices. For some white goods, fine cloth and twill increased by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece, and coarse cloth increased by 2.5 jiao per piece. Quotations for bleached and dyed cloth varied. Small amounts were still sold at the original price. Sales at retail stores on the street increased slightly due to the sudden clear weather, with a small amount of restocking. Transactions with out-of-town merchants were sparse. Shipments to Fujian and Zhejiang were intermittent. Although transportation to Hong Kong was smooth, purchases were weak. Yesterday, over 100 pieces of twill-colored cloth and coarse cloth were sold. Today, 48 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Xiamen, 375 pieces to Hong Kong, and 135 pieces to Singapore.

East Cloth: Rose sharply and fell quickly, fluctuations remained significant. In the white goods Dragon Head fine cloth market, the morning price rose to a maximum of 45.3 yuan, then fell back to 42.8 yuan. The market then rebounded to 44.25 yuan, but ultimately declined to 43.67 yuan due to sluggish actual sales. As a result, the closing price was about 5 jiao higher per piece than the previous day. However, futures were a different story. On the exchange, the current month was driven up to 45.3 yuan due to a short squeeze, matching the closing price for March.

### Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Rises Slightly

Yesterday, the sugar market was flat, fluctuating by only two or three jiao. The guild's cleared price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 81.5 yuan at the warehouse. There were more transactions of spot and futures outside the warehouse, initially at 80.8 to 80.9 yuan, then rising to 81.1 to 81.24 yuan, and then slightly easing to 81.1 to 81.2 yuan. Old Dutch red sugar was 61.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar B mark was 80.5 to 80.7 yuan at the warehouse, DY mark was 79.75 yuan at the Western warehouse, and HX mark was 79.2 to 79.5 yuan, all rising by two or three jiao. Yesterday, 3,200 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### Seafood: Fish Maw is Expensive

Recently, fish maw has been increasingly expensive as sources have become difficult and inventories have thinned. The market is strong, with high-grade products such as Guangzhou fish maw selling for 1,500 yuan, followed by hanging slices at 700 yuan, king slices at 640 yuan, and long glue at 3,200 yuan.

### Guangxi Province Advocates Special Ethnic Group Women's Education

Special Teacher Training School Enrollment

(Guilin Air Dispatch) Guangxi Province is advocating education for special ethnic groups, ensuring that children of the Miao, Yao, Zhuang, and Yi groups have access to schooling. However, education for women of these groups is still lacking. The provincial government recently received a report from Liu Jie, the director of the Provincial Special Education Teacher Training School, stating that the lack of education is the reason for the undeveloped intellect and backward customs of these groups. According to recent inquiries, students have said they are willing to bring their sisters and relatives to study. They have even requested this from the director. It is believed that these hundreds of thousands of special ethnic group women, under our government, should not be excluded from education. It is proposed to recruit a preparatory class for special ethnic group women's elementary teachers in the spring of this year, requesting approval. The provincial government has approved this and instructed each county to select students. According to the school's enrollment guidelines, the class will have 50 students selected from the Miao, Yao, Zhuang, Yi, and other special ethnic groups in each county. The enrollment date is March 1. Training will be conducted separately from existing male students, with a multi-grade teaching system based on their proficiency level. The preparatory class will last one to two years. Students who pass the examination at the end of the program will be promoted to the school's elementary normal department. After enrollment, the school will provide food, lodging, and books, as well as a mosquito net, cotton quilt, padded quilt, bed sheet, straw mat, and cotton clothing. Each semester, students will receive a stipend of one yuan and five jiao in national currency for shoes, socks, leather shoes, stationery, and paper.

### Bear to Teach the Children to Hide Their Smiles?

— A Question —

—A Visit to the New Puyu Hall—

On a bitterly cold afternoon, this reporter made the first visit in over three years since the end of the war to the New Puyu Hall. It was unexpected that in the war-torn zone, there could be such a perfect orphanage. The scene of ruins and debris contrasted sharply with the New Puyu Hall, which houses orphans, the elderly, and the disabled. They are like spring grass growing in rubble, needing nourishment and cultivation to thrive in the harsh environment. I will describe what I saw and felt below, as a report from the sidelines to the readers. Beyond the duty of reporting, it contains a sincere call for help.

Environment

On a vast field of over 120 acres, European-style buildings are nestled among lush trees. It houses a nursery, orphanage (divided into boys' and girls' sections), disability home, nursing home, mental asylum, housing for widows and widowers, free clinic, and a volunteer school. Each section has a lounge, classroom, pharmacy, and bedroom, and is managed by a nun responsible for education and care. The most commendable aspect of the facility is the attention to hygiene. Even in the dead of winter, each person must bathe once a week. Those who fall ill are immediately taken to the infirmary and isolated. Secondly, the bedrooms are clean, with neatly arranged iron beds and spotless white bedding. In terms of facilities, the hall could accommodate two or even three times as many orphans, elderly, and disabled people as it currently does. However, due to a lack of funds, it struggles to maintain its current state. Therefore, the hall's leaders have to painfully abandon many needed relief efforts and focus on educating and caring for the existing orphans. The excellent environment and facilities can only be used to expand the intake in the future.

Education and Care

Charity work should involve both education and care to enable orphans to stand on their own in society in the future. The New Puyu Hall pays great attention to this and puts it into practice. The nursery is equipped with educational toys for young children to play with, bringing smiles to their faces. The older orphans study at school for four hours each day. The girls, in addition to studying, are also taught sewing and embroidery. Even the elderly in their sixties and those who are disabled receive literacy education every day. They also do light manual work, such as sewing buttons, knitting gloves, and making paper flowers. This income, though small, helps to offset some of the hall's expenses. The supervising nuns are from Belgium, and their homeland has also fallen into tragic circumstances. Yet, they remain committed to the cause here and persevere in the face of hardship. The deputy head nun is Chinese and has served at the New Puyu Hall for nearly 30 years, earning the love and respect of all. All the nuns have a belief in love, sacrifice, and saving the world, serving the orphaned and suffering, treating the orphans like their own children and the elderly like their own elders. Their warmth is like that of a family.

Looking Back

Looking back, listening to the nuns recount the past is like reading a glorious history. In fact, it is a glorious history. Just look at the majestic buildings, the perfect facilities, and the astonishing number of orphans and sick people who have been cared for over the years, and you can imagine the great achievements of the founders and the continued dedication of their successors. When the Chinese army retreated from the west and Nanshi was occupied, the nuns evacuated the hall's residents day and night, settling them safely in the Luban Road area. The local poor, unable to care for both the old and the young, abandoned their young children and even infants at the hall. After the gates of the French Concession were closed, hundreds of children cried amidst the sounds of artillery fire and bombs. Some died of fright, some died of illness, and some died of starvation. It was not until after repeated negotiations that the nuns arrived. Only one child was still barely alive; all the others had died. What a tragic event! The rescued child is now three or four years old and lives with the other children who have been taken in. But now, they face a food shortage, and the lives of these children are once again threatened. The leaders cannot bear to see this tragedy repeated, so they are doing their best to maintain the situation and are making this plea.

Looking Ahead

This reporter personally experienced it, seeing the orphans living an orderly life, each small face showing an innocent smile; the elderly and disabled also living peacefully, enjoying their final years. This status quo needs to be supported by people in society. In other words, the New Puyu Hall has no fixed funding and is facing the abyss of despair in this time of expensive food. The hall's future, and thus the future of the orphans, elderly, and disabled, can only be hoped for with the support of people in society. The hall has educated and cared for countless orphans, the girls marrying after their selection, completing their responsibilities, but now even daily provisions have become a problem. Such a complete future is difficult to talk about; can people in society bear to see their education and care abandoned halfway, the lives of children cut short? As I write this, the smiles on the faces of the orphans reappear before my eyes. Children do not understand, how would they know a food shortage is imminent? However, can the people in society "bear to teach the children to hide their smiles?" We all feel unhappy when our own children are unhappy, but we should also know that there are countless orphans without parents who are about to fall into despair, not only losing their smiles forever, but also their lives. How should we give them what they need, like satisfying the desires of our own children? Looking ahead for the orphans, we only hope that this appeal will receive an enthusiastic response from readers, doing their utmost to help this group of pitiful orphans, the elderly, and the disabled.

### The Sacred Mission

— Editor

After the fall of Greater Shanghai, some enthusiastic people in society formed refugee shelters, while others established reformatories for the destitute. They ran around appealing and calling out for the unfortunate compatriots, advocating for their lives. Their enthusiasm is commendable, and their spirit is admirable! However, like a fleeting epiphyllum, it didn't last long. Refugee shelters, struggling with financial difficulties, sent refugees back to their hometowns one after another. Even more tragically, some charitable organizations saw corruption cases. In these three years, indeed, the "isolated island" saw a distorted development that made shortsighted people forget the pain of reality. However, unfortunate incidents such as corruption cases were also among the reasons that hindered various charitable undertakings.

Now, in a corner of Nanshi, there is such an orphanage, a paradise for the old and weak. Under the arduous efforts of nuns with a spirit of sacrifice and salvation, it has been sustained for so long and has already achieved good results. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have children? After reading the preceding "Visit to the New Pu Yu Tang," we should reflect and feel ashamed. Reflect – we have taken the wrong steps; Ashamed – this was originally our responsibility!

According to the record of this newspaper's local news two days ago, they need 16,000 yuan per month. Apart from the regular income of 6,000 yuan, there is a shortfall of 10,000 yuan. Calculated annually, it is only 100,000 yuan. Given the fluctuations in the economic market, a week's loss is 10,000,000 yuan. The amount of 100,000 yuan is even more insignificant. I hope people from all walks of life, for themselves, for their children and grandchildren, for the country, and for the nation, will complete this sacred mission.

"According to Director Ma, this was what Garrison Commander Yuan personally took a fancy to on the day you held your fifth-anniversary celebration," Father added in explanation.

Although Xiangqi saw a few soldiers sitting in the guest seats on that day, she would never have imagined that the fattest one with the worst attitude was the Garrison Commander Yuan who intended to swallow her up.

"About how old is he?" After struggling for a long time, she couldn't help but ask.

"Actually, he's only in his thirties," Mother rushed to answer.

"Thirties?" This was greatly beyond Xiangqi's expectations. She remembered that the ages of the few soldiers she saw were at least in their forties. "It's best to have Dad get a picture to look at first."

Mother seemed to think it was too much trouble, and said in a very heavy voice:

"Child, the matter is...certainly...good....First...their...bride price...sent...here, your elder brother's medical...expenses...won't be a worry...You...why...be...undecided?"

But Father agreed with Xiangqi's suggestion.

A little over a week later, Mr. Luo brought back two things from Director Ma: one was a picture of a man in his thirties, wearing plain clothes, with a very thin appearance; the other was a letter of appointment as a staff member of the Second Section of the Department of Education.

Xiangqi stared at the photo for a long time and said very suspiciously.

"This person seems to be someone I didn't see that day."

"Maybe wearing military uniform and wearing plain clothes are a bit different, but it's definitely not fake!" Father explained from the side.

The matter was decided like this.

Forty days later, with Governor Hu as the witness, a wedding ceremony similar to a farce was performed in the largest restaurant in Tianjin. The most magical thing was not this wedding, but the fickle groom: the one in the photo was originally a man in his thirties with a delicate appearance; in less than two months, he had become a man in his forties, tall and fat, half like an ox and half like a fierce tiger.

The Entertainment World

### "The Three Mesquiteers"

— Cheng Bingnu

Starring in "The Three Mesquiteers" are Kay Kyser, Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, George Zucco, and Helen Parrish, etc. Kay Kyser is an American radio broadcasting star. His "appearance" is very much like Roque, except that his mouth is fluent, but his acting is really not very brilliant. However, this man is exceptionally hardworking, and quite a few people like him. Although Peter Lorre is full of acting skill, there isn't much acting to be done in "The Three Mesquiteers." Karloff and Zucco are similarly in insignificant positions. "The Three Mesquiteers" and all of that, at first glance, seems unusually stimulating, but it's really just so-so.

The story of "The Three Mesquiteers" probably got too unreasonable for the sake of being too stimulating. The three demons wanted to seize Helen Parrish's property, first using ghosts and monsters to frighten her, and then trying to put her to death, but the methods were very clumsy. Kay Kyser is a broadcasting star who was invited to her house to sing at Helen's birthday party, and the bizarre legends surrounding the three demons in the house were finally broken.

Apart from this nonsensical story, the whole play is not without its merits, which is the thickness of the atmosphere of terror. The director used sound effects and deliberately created a sense of mystery to make the audience shiver. For example, when Zucco cast spells, the lights in the house went out, ghosts wailed, and there was a storm; Kyser went alone to explore the underground mechanism and exposed the secret of the three demons; and when sleeping at night, he saw a walking light in the dark, which was actually a dog's tail. All of these were mixed with a lot of jokes amidst the tension and excitement.

However, the playwrights didn't seem to feel satisfied with this achievement, so they added a few songs to give the ladies who love songs a chance to appreciate them. Thus, "The Three Mesquiteers" became a three-flavored soup made with "horror, humor, and singing" as ingredients.

### Tang Ruoqing Recovers from Illness and Performs New Mei Luo Xiang; Duanmu Lanxin Guest Stars

Of the five famous plays scheduled to be performed for the China Travel Service's eighth-anniversary celebration, "Sunrise," "Li Xiangjun," and "Hua Mulan" have already been performed. On the evening of "Hua Mulan's" performance, Tang Ruoqing suddenly fainted in the dressing room due to physical exhaustion. At that time, it not only caused a commotion among the backstage personnel, but also the audience expressed concern. However, the performance dates for the five famous plays had already been decided, so although Tang Ruoqing has recovered her health in these three days, in order to avoid disappointing the audience who have already reserved seats, it was decided to perform "New Mei Luo Xiang" as scheduled starting tomorrow night. "Hua Mulan" will be performed after "Thunderstorm" has finished. It is said that in "New Mei Luo Xiang," in addition to Tang Ruoqing playing the villainous sophisticated young woman Xiao Chunlan, and Tang Huaiqiu still playing the veteran Bai Senqing, the newcomer to the stage, Duanmu Lanxin, will be cast in the role of Mei Luo Xiang. Duanmu Lanxin has an amazing acting talent. It is heard that the China Travel Service first invited her to guest star, meet the audience, and then hire her as a full-time actor.
