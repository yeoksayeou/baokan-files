### U.S. to Greatly Expand Defense Facilities in Various Regions of the Pacific; $35 Million Gold Dollars Earmarked; Kimmel Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet

Washington – President Roosevelt, in his budget message to Congress yesterday, essentially declared that the United States will greatly expand its defense facilities in the Pacific, including Guam, the Philippines, the Samoan Islands, Hawaii, Palmyra, Johnston Island, and Midway Island. President Roosevelt plans to earmark over 35 million U.S. dollars in this area. The Navy Department plans to spend $1,437,500 on Guam and $5.5 million in the Fourteenth Naval District to deepen and improve port waterways, etc. A year ago, the Navy Department's request for funds within the Fourteenth District to improve Guam was rejected by Congress. This time, the government will again ask Congress for approval. An additional $13 million is requested for projects in Hawaii. The Navy Department will also request $215,000 for Philippine defense projects, the largest amount in recent years. Of the Guam expenditure, $187,500 will be used to expand military motor roads and $250,000 to improve power plants. In addition, a storage depot for seaplanes will be built on Midway Island, a gasoline depot on Johnston Island, and $1,491,000 will be used in Sitka, Alaska (formerly the capital of the Russian era). A naval air station will be built in Dutch Harbor, requiring $2,292,000. The Army Department's expenses have not yet been published, but its expenditure in the Philippines is expected to be comparable to that of the Navy. (United Press, 9th)

Washington - Of all the items in the U.S. budget, the one that may draw the most attention in the Far East is the section concerning the Navy Department. This section states in very clear terms that the United States intends to build the largest navy the world has ever seen. Last year's naval expenditure was already very large, but this year's expenditure is about 100 million yuan higher than last year's. This budget stipulates that the item for new construction and machinery is about $1,135,000,000 (last year it was $561,000,000). In addition, it stipulates that the expense for armament, ordnance, and ammunition is $380,000,000. This year's naval air force budget is $434,000,000 (last year it was $355,000,000). The maintenance cost for warships is also set at $206,000,000, and the expenditure for artillery is $167,000,000. The increase in the number of naval personnel can also be seen in the new figure for naval salaries, which has increased from $284,000,000 last year to $411,000,000 this year. This year's expenditure on naval docks and shipyards will also reach $175,000,000. President Roosevelt estimates a shortfall of $9,210,000,000, which will create an unprecedented public debt of $58,367,000,000, and the current public debt limit of $49,000,000,000 will inevitably increase. The deficit in 1931 was only $16,185,000,000. The unprecedented national revenue of $87,000,000,000 will be $7,000,000,000 more than the most prosperous year, 1929. The national defense expenditure set by the President includes $3,447,000,000 for the Navy, $5,956,000,000 for the Army, $407,000,000 for various agencies including the Detective Bureau, and $1,000,000,000 for future appropriations. The President's budget book is thousands of pages long, listing various national defense expenditures in detail, to prevent opponents from criticizing him. (Reuters, 9th)

### U.S. Reorganizes Navy; Two Fleets Stationed in the Pacific; Naval Personnel Increased by 40,000

Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday replaced the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy and ordered all U.S. warships to prepare for full wartime readiness. The new Commander-in-Chief of the Navy is Rear Admiral Kimmel, replacing Admiral Richardson. Admiral Hepburn remains Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, and Admiral Andrews remains in command of the expanding Atlantic Fleet. Captain Knox said that the United States is currently reorganizing its fleet system. Captain Knox stated that this reorganization represents a "readjustment to reality." "We are currently gradually expanding our Atlantic Fleet to make it independent." He said that the strength of the Atlantic Fleet is also being considered for change, and its current strength is 125 warships. The U.S. fleet will henceforth be called the "U.S. Navy" and will be divided into three main groups: two fleets stationed in the Pacific and one stationed in the Atlantic. The "Pacific Fleet" will be stationed in Hawaii, and the commander of that fleet will also serve as commander-in-chief of the three major fleets. Admiral Richardson has been ordered to report to Captain Knox for certain undisclosed responsibilities. The Secretary of the Navy said that according to current decisions, this reorganization will not affect the routine fleet exercise plan in the Pacific in the spring. When President Roosevelt ordered all warships to prepare for full wartime strength, he authorized the Navy Department to increase personnel from 192,000 to 233,000. Captain Knox said that this increase in personnel also applies to naval reservists. He said that as the fleet gradually expands, it will increase again. All appointed warships are making preparations for full wartime strength. Knox announced that President Roosevelt's order will take effect on February 1, 1941. Rear Admiral Kimmel is 58 years old. Knox announced that he graduated from the Annapolis Naval Academy in 1904, and his two sons are also serving in the Navy. Kimmel was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1937. (United Press, 9th)

Washington - U.S. Navy Secretary Knox said yesterday that the Navy Department plans to ask Congress to authorize the construction of 100 auxiliary ships such as submarines, patrol boats, minesweepers, and scout ships. When asked by reporters about the possibility of continuing to aid Britain with destroyers, Knox replied that he did not think the U.S. Navy could allocate any more destroyers without hindering the efficiency of the U.S. Navy. However, the final decision is not up to him. (Reuters, 9th)

### As a Result of the Budget, U.S. Will Raise Taxes; Methods to Be Decided by Congress

Washington – It is expected in official circles that as a result of President Roosevelt's budget message, income tax and excess profits tax will be greatly increased immediately. Tax revenue will reach the highest peak in American history under the current budget process, but the President has proposed increasing taxes. The methods of increasing taxes will be left to Congress. Increases in gift tax and property tax are also expected. The budget also proposes increasing the number of detectives by 500 to deter espionage and sabotage. This team already has 1,500 people, which is the same number as during the last European war. (Reuters, 9th)

### Constructing New Bases; Roosevelt's Huge Budget Emphasizes Caribbean Defense

Washington – President Roosevelt's proposed budget for 1942 emphasizes the defense of the Caribbean, but states that most of the emergency construction projects in the region have already been completed in previous budgets. The only new project in this budget is to improve the naval and air station on St. John's Island at a cost of $1,105,000. It is also planned to strengthen naval fortifications in Guantanamo with $170,000. As for the naval defense plan on Isla Grande, Puerto Rico, the air force aspects include $300,000 to expand the airfield, $255,000 to open additional airfields, $250,000 to expand business, and $2,000,000 to build residences for unmarried officers. The Army Department stated that the authorities will continue this new project, including the construction of bomb and gasoline warehouses at a cost of $1,021,000. The Army and Navy will build a dock near the Panama Canal in the Atlantic Ocean at a cost of $7,500,000 so that American ships can sail there for repairs without having to detour to Norfolk. (United Press, 9th)

Washington – House Speaker Rayburn, a Democrat from Texas, yesterday consulted with Secretary of State Hull and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to draft a new bill that would allow the United States to lend Britain hundreds of millions of dollars. President Roosevelt yesterday asked Congress to approve a huge budget for the coming year, totaling $17,585,000,000, and some in political circles predict that aid to Britain will require an additional $30 to $100 billion outside the domestic budget. Defense expenditure accounts for 62 percent of this budget. Yesterday, the President stated in his budget message that of the total of $28,000,000,000 allocated for national defense over three years, the distribution is $13,704,000,000 for the Army, $11,587,000,000 for the Navy, $1,902,000,000 for factory expansion, and $1,287,000,000 for other items. The Army's expenditure does not include the cost of building double locks for the Panama Canal or other items. This total amount can support the largest army of 1.4 million people and 300 warships in the United States during peacetime. The Army currently has 100,000 conscripts and 500,000 regular soldiers. Salaries alone require $11 billion, and food and supplies cost $1,781,901,000. Air Force personnel require $1,190,854,000. Among the various defense construction projects, there are ship repair docks, airfields, underground gasoline depots, bomb-proof ammunition depots, seaplane storage depots, aircraft runways, port projects, large-scale aircraft manufacturing, new automatic rifles, anti-aircraft guns, and large coastal artillery. There will also be a large number of Flying Fortresses equipped with bulletproof gasoline tanks and armored gunner seats. President Roosevelt also requested $250 million in emergency funds, the purpose of which was not specified in detail, but is likely for the construction of new bases in the Caribbean (leased from Britain).

### U.S. Aid to China, Britain, and Greece; President Urges Expedited Handling; May Submit Appropriation Requests at Any Time; Secretary of State Hull Reports Insiders in Senate

Washington – News yesterday that President Roosevelt's proposed bill to lease war materials to China, Britain, and Greece will be submitted to Congress within 48 hours. It is rumored that President Roosevelt will request Congress to expedite the handling of this bill. Sources familiar with the matter said that President Roosevelt may not request a specific amount of funds, but will make requests to Congress from time to time to allocate funds for the purpose of carrying out this procedure. It is understood that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to invite Secretary of State Hull and his staff to provide an insider's account of the European war and other world situations. (United Press, 9th)

Washington – A draft bill granting the U.S. government greater power to lend ships, tanks, artillery, and aircraft to Britain and other democracies has been prepared and is expected to be submitted to Congress tomorrow. It is expected that both houses will consider this bill simultaneously. According to House Speaker Rayburn, the sooner this bill is passed, the better. It is rumored that this bill is a completely new bill and does not contain any amendments to the Neutrality Act. The $2,750,000,000 in funds requested by President Roosevelt in his message to Congress for U.S. defense purposes does not include aid to Britain, because the plans of various democracies to manufacture armaments have not yet been approved by Congress. However, President Roosevelt has stated that $2,500,000,000 will be needed in the next two years, and this amount will be increased as needed. Today, according to Washington news, the majority of the American people believe that the United States should give Britain all assistance except war. Therefore, they do not express surprise at President Roosevelt's huge budget of $4,375,000,000. Democratic leader Barkley said today that this budget is the minimum amount that the United States should spend on national defense. It is generally acknowledged that the majority of the increased expenditure will come from increased income tax. (Reuters, 9th)

### Mexican Oil Exports to Japan Reach One Million Barrels; Quantity Increases as Japan Joins Axis

New York – Authoritative sources here revealed last night that since the start of the European war, Japan has directly imported almost one million barrels of oil from Mexico. It is said that these ships carrying oil may have been transferred to Germany under the Axis agreement. Before mid-November before the European war, Japan was unable to import kerosene from Mexico. However, in contradiction to this, Mexican oil began to flow into Japan. When Germany bombed London and Japan joined the Axis powers, the import of Mexican oil to Japan increased even more.

Editorial

### The Evolving International Triad

All of the future will immediately impact the international situation. Although the origins are distant and the brewing has been long, in recent days, these trends have successively developed to the point of imminent explosion, becoming the three most noteworthy patterns of the current moment: First, Bulgaria is experiencing extreme pressure, both internally in its politics and externally in its neutrality, and it appears increasingly unable to maintain its original state. Second, the Thai government has declared a state of so-called war on the Thai-Vietnamese border. Third, the United States has, in effect, shed the cloak of neutrality, openly making a sharp and rapid advance on the international stage. None of these three are sudden or isolated events.

Regarding all the news about Bulgaria, sometimes it spreads rapidly, sometimes we recognize it, making it confusing and difficult to discern the truth. However, experience tells us that this is not fabricated out of nothing, but rather smoke indicating fire; not illusory, but a hint before exposure; not external disruption, but internal struggles to eliminate changes and promote transformations. In mid-November of last year, Bulgaria almost joined the German-Italian Axis after Hungary and Romania, due to overwhelming pressure. However, the Soviet Union expressed dissent, and the country pulled back from the brink. Five months have passed, and now Bulgaria is wavering again. Today, it is still difficult to understand who has won the struggle, or how the Soviet Union and Germany-Italy have positioned themselves in these five months. The Soviet Union's actions on the international stage are extremely clever, but the international community has determined that it is unwilling to fight with real strength, which has become its only weakness in dealing with the world. With this weakness, it is not difficult for international desperados to "exploit" it. It is not necessary to ask what choices the Bulgarian authorities will make, or how its people will support or oppose them. In short, if the changes cannot be eliminated and the original state is altered, the Balkans will immediately experience a great wave, which will initially affect the strategy between Greece and Italy, and then affect Turkey, Yugoslavia, and even the Soviet Union's neutrality.

Regarding Thailand and French Vietnam, diplomatic negotiations have turned into armed conflict. For months, the situation has sometimes eased slightly and sometimes become extremely tense. Assuming that yesterday's report that the Thai government declared a state of war on the Thai-Vietnamese border is accurate, then in terms of international law, it cannot be immediately regarded as a declaration of war, but it is very different from a silent armed conflict. It is not necessary to elaborate on how declaring a local state of war affects the rights and obligations of international third parties, but it must be seen as a trend towards formal war between Thailand and Vietnam, that is, with France. The problem is too complex and delicate. Thailand has shown various signs of colluding with Japan, and its own fragility and international interests cannot withstand any pressure from Britain and the United States. The Vietnamese authorities have declared their determination to resist. Once the fighting starts, the Vichy government will certainly not sit idly by, and General Catroux will certainly not condone Thailand. It is as if there is no quick knife that can solve the tangled mess, nor is it a dispute that countries with intertwined interests will allow to arise and perish on its own. So, who are Thailand's allies, who are French Vietnam's allies, and how will the international community divide itself in this dispute? Although chaos may be allowed in the initial stages, it will eventually become clear. The evolution is unlikely to be grasped by any party today. Relevant countries may not have time to participate in this matter today, but when a formal state of war is established, it will immediately become a serious issue that relevant countries must resolve.

As for the attitude of the United States, this newspaper already described it yesterday as having entered a new era. Last night, we learned that the U.S. authorities, in order to make the navy "meet the facts," have already reallocated it and are preparing for full wartime strength, dividing the entire naval force into three major fleets, one in the Atlantic and two in the Pacific, with the commander of the Pacific Fleet also serving as the commander-in-chief of the three major fleets. The world will surely be able to distinguish the weight and significance of this measure. In addition, we have learned that the bill to lease war materials to China, Britain, and Greece will quickly begin its journey in Congress. After the U.S. Congress passes President Roosevelt's military spending bill, the American people will bear a daily military expenditure of 48 million U.S. dollars; this is a greater number than what is paid by general belligerent countries. From the increasingly strong steps of the United States, showing a spirit of both sword and shoes, it is clear that the United States does not have the weakness of "unwilling to fight with real strength" in the international arena; and the remaining question of whether or not it will fight only asks whether the aggressor nations will provoke it!

Normally, reasoning about the above three patterns, each pattern's development is an extension of the world's war situation. Although we do not want to see the war situation expand, expansion cannot be stopped by will. Bulgaria is the easiest medium to cause the war situation to expand. As for the United States, taking the victory or defeat of China and Britain as its own victory or defeat is its wisest view; to support the war efforts of China, Britain, and Greece as a substitute for fighting itself is its wisest policy. For, by normal reasoning, if Germany cannot defeat Britain, it will never dare to provoke the United States; if Japan cannot defeat China, it will never dare to provoke the United States. Therefore, the United States only needs to vigorously support China and Britain, and it can avoid direct warfare. However, the two countries of Japan and Germany will eventually recognize that if they cannot overcome the United States, they will not be able to defeat China and Britain. Under this recognition, will they retreat when they know the situation, or will they take a risk and provoke the United States? The matter is unknowable, that is, the chances of peace and war are half and half. Moreover, if Thailand and Vietnam actually go to war, the consequences will affect the military strategic position of Singapore, the Philippines, and Burma. If this happens, the front line is getting closer and closer to the United States.

### Most of the Japanese Troops Crossing the Sui River Were Eliminated by Chinese Forces; Chinese Forces in Southern Shanxi Entered the East Gate of Qinshui; Japanese Troops Suffering a Crushing Defeat at Yanglousi in Northern Hunan

Lanzhou - According to front-line reports, the Japanese troops who crossed from Baotou to the west bank of the Yellow River to invade China were fiercely attacked by a certain Chinese unit. On the evening of the 31st, all the Japanese troops were defeated, and most of them crossed the river and fled back. Only a small part remains, and the Chinese army is encircling and annihilating them. (9th Dispatch) A Chinese military spokesman in Chongqing told reporters today that the Japanese troops around Xuzhou began to harass the Chinese forces on the northwest sides after adding a division. In the past week, the battles in central China have had no major significance and appear to be exploratory in nature, testing the Chinese military strength. The main area of activity is Tongcheng, south of Hankou, where two Japanese regiments attempted to advance south, and in the mountains west of Nanchang, Chinese positions were attacked. In Shandong Province, a Japanese regiment moved south from Jinan, but was ambushed, and the Chinese army killed hundreds of them. Other battles occurred on the railway line from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou, in areas south of the Yellow River, and in western Shanxi. (Reuters, 9th)

A Certain Place in Western Sui - Since last month, the Japanese troops entrenched in western Sui have been restless from time to time. They have been attacked by Chinese forces many times. After the defeat, the Japanese once again invaded on December 28 of last year, with Wang Ying's troops as the vanguard, and are now confronting the Chinese army. The Central News Agency reporter interviewed a certain senior officer to understand the true situation of the battle. According to him, this time the Japanese sent more than 4,000 soldiers, dozens of artillery pieces, and several aircraft to cross the river and invade China in three routes. After being met by Chinese resistance, the Japanese did not succeed. In addition, the Japanese once again sent a mixed force to reinforce from Tangaimuduga (east of Wanxing West). They engaged in bloody battles with the Chinese army in the areas of Wanxing West, Halahaozi (north of Wanxing West), Mao Bu La Gou (west of Six Points), and Six Points. Until 3 a.m. on the morning of the decision, the battle extended to Tangaimuduga, Baitu Liang, Wang Da Liang, and En Yibei (all southwest of Tangaimuduga). On the night of the invasion of Chou Haibula, two Japanese vehicles were destroyed by the Chinese army.

After fierce fighting until the morning of the 7th, the Japanese were unable to withstand it and retreated in defeat. (7th Dispatch)

### Zhang Jia'ao on Post-War Construction

Chongqing - Zhang Jia'ao recently discussed the progress of the construction in the Greater Rear Area, saying, "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the setbacks and sacrifices we have endured are truly difficult to describe in detail. However, adversity builds a nation, as the ancient saying goes. I dare to respectfully inform the people of Shanghai that the progress of our Greater Rear Area's construction is advancing at an incredible speed, having established its foundation for new life and revival under the threat of Japanese artillery fire. We know that every nation in the world has its difficult and challenging historical stages, and its deep-rooted strength stems from the people's resolute determination to overcome all difficulties and turn danger into safety. Regarding the current situation of post-war construction, in terms of transportation, the main artery of the highway, stretching over ten thousand li from Yangon, across China from west to east and north to south, and to Moscow, has been completed. Travel and transportation are becoming more convenient day by day. Recently, I traveled to the Northwest and saw magnificent river fortresses along the way, with boundless resources and wealth waiting to be developed. It is truly felt that the great endowment to us is exceptionally generous. Major cities across the country can communicate via telephone and telegraph. During my trip to the Northwest, which lasted over a month and spanned five provinces, I could directly call Chongqing, the wartime capital, anytime and anywhere. Postal and telegraph services have been widely established even in remote areas. Railway construction has been vigorously pursued in recent years. Those under construction include the Xiang-Gui, Qian-Gui, Dian-Mian, Xu-Kun, and Cheng-Yu railways. In terms of water transport, we are actively developing shipping routes and building our own ships. All plans that can enrich inland river transport are being comprehensively planned and implemented. In addition, the aviation network has been expanded, and post station transport is being promoted. In the past, people in Shanghai viewed the provinces in the Rear Area as extremely poor and suffering, with extremely inconvenient transportation. In fact, this general concept has become a thing of the past. The establishment of a new China is now in sight during this great era of resistance and construction, thanks to the power of national mobilization. I deeply believe that our compatriots residing on the isolated island of Shanghai, looking west to Sichuan and thinking of its vibrant and ever-changing situation, will have boundless emotion and excitement, and will roll up their sleeves and rise up, joining hands to embrace the motherland and work together on the great cause of resistance and construction. We, in light of the speed and magnitude of the progress in post-war construction promoted by the past three years of war, and looking ahead, feel that our responsibilities are even heavier and our efforts are endless. We can only strengthen our beliefs, implement our spirit, and, under the sole leadership of the supreme leader, prepare to move further, to endure the greater setbacks and costs that a newly emerging nation must inevitably face, to exhaust our sincerity, and to strive for the final victory of the war as soon as possible."

### The Power of Youth (Continued)

— Zhen Lifu

In short, our country's life education integrates the cultivation of oneself in dealing with people and the world. From ancient times to the present, and even into the infinite future, it is consistently preserved in the soul of every individual. In times of urgency, it unleashes infinite brilliance. As Aeschylus said, "A person is only satisfied after dedicating himself to an event greater than himself." (J. Royee, Philosophy of Royalty). We Chinese have never easily let go of handling great events. The so-called "a scholar reveals his integrity in times of poverty" is an extremely valuable lesson left by countless benevolent and righteous people over thousands of years. Everything our youth are showing now is a replay of this lesson. Japan thinks it cannot be ignored and feels shocked, but for us, it is commonplace and not surprising at all.

With these lovely young people, what kind of result will occur for our future of resistance and construction? I think everyone already knows the answer in their hearts, and there is no need to describe it in detail. However, perhaps some people still suspect that I am making optimistic propaganda, so I must cite some facts to comfort the compatriots across the country.

First, the thoughts and actions of our youth now are more practical. The past problems of empty talk and fantasy have gradually decreased. Since the Japanese destroyed our cultural relics, our only response is to desperately build. The current achievements are naturally far from ideal, but in terms of the speed of progress, I believe that our central government's grand scale for building a new China can definitely be completed by the youth of today. There are two most obvious examples that can be used as a basis for speculation. One is that the majority of students now tend towards practical subjects in their learning aspirations. The following is a statistical table of the number of students admitted to public vocational schools and above in the past three years:

Also, the total number of applicants was 11,119 in the 27th year, 20,006 in the 28th year, and approximately over 20,000 in the 29th year. Why are there so many people entering engineering? Because the social need is great, which also shows the rapid advance of construction projects. It can be determined that the future prospects for students after graduation are not as difficult as before. During each graduation season, the Ministry of Education introduces all the graduates to various agencies according to their majors. However, the result is always that the demand exceeds the supply. The majority of graduates from many schools are snatched up before they are even introduced. The only difficulty we feel now is that the existing schools cannot fully accommodate students who are eager to enroll. Everyone unanimously sees that the construction industry will be greatly accelerated in the future, and the number of construction talents needed will be many times greater than it is now. Not only is this the case for engineering, but also for literature, law, commerce, and teacher training. Therefore, in the minds of general students, there is a very serious feeling, which is how to use their knowledge to gain social status. Thus, a practical and hardworking atmosphere is unconsciously developed. Even under the constant threat of air raids, people are still attending classes and studying in air raid shelters.

Japanese Small Warships to Sail to Hanoi

Hanoi - Well-informed sources close to Japanese officials stated yesterday that several Japanese small warships will sail up the Red River to Hanoi on Monday. These sources stated that the reason for the Japanese warships to enter Hanoi is to provide military support for the Franco-Japanese negotiations currently underway in Tokyo. At the same time, Japan attempted to transport a batch of tanks, troops, and artillery from Haiphong to Hanoi on Tuesday, but the French refused to allow the vehicles to enter Hanoi. They are currently piled up in the suburbs of Hanoi. Informed sources stated that the military supplies were not intended to be transported to the Chinese border, but are related to the Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. (9th United Press dispatch)

Hanoi - Major General Anan, an official from the Japanese Army Ministry, arrived here yesterday and was received by Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux, who hosted a luncheon in his honor, along with General Martin, Commander of the French Forces in Vietnam, General Nishimura, Head of the Japanese Military Delegation, and several members of the Japanese Navy and Consulate.

Thai and Vietnamese Aircraft Bomb Each Other

Saigon - Today, Saigon Radio broadcast news stating that Thai aircraft had bombed Sisophon and another border city in Cambodia, killing two and injuring eleven. In addition, Thai troops launched a surprise attack. On the evening of January 7, French aircraft bombed several locations in Thailand in retaliation. Reports from Bangkok that Thai troops had invaded 15 miles into Vietnam and that French troops had retreated are all unfounded. Thai reconnaissance teams have occasionally crossed into French territory and attempted to incite the natives, but once they come into contact with French troops, they flee back to Thailand. It is reported that Vietnamese French officials are quite interested in the messages broadcast by Bangkok, stating that the Thai government does not want to cause difficulties for both sides. It has been pointed out that the statement in Bangkok Radio seems to contradict the actions of the Thai military. The increasingly rampant behavior of the Thai military seems likely to provoke severe retaliation from the Vietnamese side, but the general public still believes that the situation is not completely hopeless. If the Bangkok authorities declare that Thai troops will cease all hostile actions on a certain day and time, the French side will also adopt the same attitude of ceasing retaliation. Such a method will surely create a more harmonious atmosphere. When someone asked Vietnamese officials about this matter, they all refused to express an opinion, only saying that the hostile actions of the Thai side have forced them to take appropriate measures. The evolution of these measures will depend entirely on the events that occur and the attitude of Bangkok. (9th Reuters dispatch)

Bangkok - Thai military officials declared that after 30 Thai aircraft continuously bombed on January 6, they forced the Vietnamese army to retreat in panic from Poipet in Cambodia to Sisophon. During the retreat, they were trapped by Thai aircraft, causing the ranks to be disorganized. (9th Reuters dispatch)

### Amid German Advance, Balkan Situation Chaotic / Iron Guard Unstable in Romania / Bulgarian Prime Minister's Difficult Diplomacy, Rumors of Resignation

Budapest - Hungarian newspapers yesterday prominently published news from the capital cities of Bulgaria and Romania stating that the situation within Romania is gradually becoming unstable. The news states that Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu was forced to arrest several radical members of the Iron Guard in order to maintain his own power. It is reported that the radical elements of the Iron Guard insisted that Antonescu quickly reorganize the cabinet, causing the general situation in the Romanian capital to become tense. Many residents of the Romanian capital who are able to move have already moved out of the city, as they fear that this conflict will escalate into street fighting or other riots. (9th United Press dispatch)

Budapest - It is rumored that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov intends to resign after returning to the Bulgarian capital from a visit to Vienna. As a result, the Balkan situation became increasingly tense last night, fearing that the war would soon extend to the Balkans. It is rumored that the situation in Romania is becoming more critical due to the Iron Guard's declaration of war on General Antonescu. It is also rumored that Germany intends to take severe measures to oppose the Soviet Union's sudden actions against Romania. Furthermore, it is rumored that an increasing number of German and Soviet troops are now confronting each other on the Soviet-Romanian border. The entry of German troops into Bulgaria was expected by most people, but it did not materialize yesterday. Diplomatic circles still have divided opinions on this issue. Some believe that this rumor was spread by the Germans to divert attention from other actions, while others insist that the military action of German troops entering Bulgaria will still arrive on time. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov refused to comment on his visit to Vienna. Filov also denied the news that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had handed him an ultimatum demanding that German troops enter Bulgaria, and that he had accepted the ultimatum. As for the rumor that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet has concentrated outside Bulgarian ports, this matter remains mysterious and unpredictable. (9th International Service dispatch)

Bucharest - Senior naval circles claimed yesterday that a Soviet warship squadron, approximately nine ships, was severely warned by Romanian warships not to approach.

Swiss Capital - According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the British Minister to Romania submitted a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denying rumors about instability in Romania. The Romanian Embassy in the UK also stated that Romania is maintaining a normal state, but bad weather has slightly disrupted transportation. (9th Haitong dispatch)

Bulgarian Capital - Interior Minister Gabrovski announced that all regions are maintaining a calm and normal state. The police have been ordered to severely punish those who spread rumors, distribute pamphlets, and engage in various activities that endanger the country. Large-scale demonstrations will be held in various regions in the coming days. Cabinet Prime Minister Filov and other cabinet members will deliver speeches on the current situation. (9th Haitong dispatch)

Vichy - Regarding the situation in the Balkan Peninsula, rumors have been rife in recent days. After repeated denials by the authorities of the countries concerned, the situation has become clearer. What has been clarified is that the King of Bulgaria did not go to Berlin. Although the Bulgarian Cabinet Prime Minister Filov went to Vienna, it has not yet been confirmed that he met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The Soviet Union's recall of its envoys to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, and the two statements of German troops entering Bulgaria, have also been proven untrue. Romanian telephone and telegraph communications were interrupted for a time, but have been restored. As for German-Soviet relations, only the issue of navigation management on the Danube River remains to be resolved. The International Commission for the Management of Navigation on the Danube River closed last month without reaching an agreement. According to the Soviet Union, navigation on the lower reaches of the Danube River should be jointly managed by the Soviet Union and Romania. The commission is scheduled to reconvene this month to discuss this matter. In addition, the Turkish Foreign Minister delivered a speech a few days ago, forcefully stating that the country's foreign policy is purely defensive in nature and has not changed. The Turkish President's visit to the Slesvig district to inspect defenses also has no significant meaning. (8th Havas dispatch)

Swiss City - The correspondent of the Swiss Basel City News in Berlin recently reported that the Soviet Union and Germany have been conducting business negotiations in Moscow for two months. They have recently signed a protocol to extend the effective period of the current business agreement by 18 months, until August 1, 1942. It is still difficult to know what changes will occur in German-Soviet business relations after that. In general, the two sides will increase the amount of certain goods exchanged within the current trade scope, but the total trade volume may not increase. (8th Havas dispatch)

### British Forces Close in on Tobruk / Italian Situation Increasingly Serious / Now Concentrating All Forces in North Africa / Preparing to Defend the Benghazi Line to the Death

London - Reuters correspondent telegraphed from British headquarters in Cairo: the Italian garrison in Tobruk may not receive more reinforcements, and their situation is becoming more serious. British aircraft reconnaissance in the Tobruk area did not see Italian troop movements. British empire forces are gradually approaching Tobruk City. The British headquarters in Cairo is now unwilling to comment on the nature of British progress. However, they know that the British forces are making progress that makes the commander "extremely satisfied". Officials recently disclosed that three commanders of the Italian Blackshirt Legion abandoned their troops and fled overnight before the fall of Bardia, indicating that the morale of the Italian army led by General Graziani, the commander of the Italian army in Libya, has completely disintegrated. (9th Reuters dispatch)

Cairo - A British military spokesperson stated that the number of British tanks, armored vehicles, and infantry concentrated in the Tobruk area is increasing daily. However, there is still one way for the Italian army to retreat, which is to follow the coast to Derna, 75 miles west. There is currently no sign that the Italian army is withdrawing from Tobruk. Furthermore, a senior official of the British Air Force stated that the continued arrival of Royal Air Force aircraft to the front line is not as rapid as it was two and a half months ago. The Italian army can obtain assistance from Germany, and our future will be very difficult. However, our hope of success is greater than it was two and a half months ago. Since the British Air Force in the Middle East began fighting with Italy, it has shot down 500 Italian aircraft and carried out 2,000 air raids on various parts of Italy. The British aircraft losses are less than 100 aircraft. (9th United Press dispatch)

British Headquarters - According to reliable military intelligence last night, the Italian high command has abandoned Tobruk, allowing it to be besieged and even lost. At the same time, it is concentrating all its forces in North Africa, planning to defend the Benghazi line to the death. Furthermore, the Australian mechanized units have cut off the road to the west of Tobruk. (9th International Service dispatch)

Rome - The Italian high command stated that yesterday, a major battle was still ongoing between Bardia and Tobruk. The Italian communiqué stated that a British destroyer was destroyed off the coast of Solum. However, it admitted that British aircraft again heavily bombed Tripoli, with four Italians dead and at least ten injured. The Italian communiqué also stated that three British aircraft were shot down. (9th International Service dispatch)

Cairo - Tobruk has been completely surrounded by Allied forces, and its defense works are now under the artillery fire of the British vanguard. It is reported that there are very few Italian defenders active, and there is no sign of external reinforcements arriving. (9th Reuters dispatch)

Gong Da Xiang Silk Fabric Store, located at 1212-1213 Haig Road in the Shanghai West, a two-story building, is owned by Ningbo native Ye Deben (50 years old), who also serves as the manager.

Two kidnappers restrained Ye, while the other took out a pre-prepared rope and tied his hands behind his back. Seeing the pistols, Ye did not resist and allowed the kidnappers to do as they pleased. After tying him up, they dragged him outside and pushed him into a Cloud Flying Automobile Company car, license number 12376, which was waiting at the door. The kidnappers also boarded the car, which sped off to the north. At around 9:00 PM that evening, the car was found on Di Feng Road near Ping Yuan Road.

According to the English "North China Daily Mail," with the cooperation of the Japanese Military Police, the Public Concession police have arrested a Chinese thief in Hangzhou who had been wanted for three weeks.

### 大房東串通三房客　控二房東遷讓　三房客向大房東挖租房屋　與泰蛋行不服上訴昨開審
Head Landlord Colludes with Third-Party Tenants to Sue Second-Party Tenant for Eviction. Third-Party Tenants Offer to Rent Premises Directly from Head Landlord. Appeals Against Tai Dan Egg Company Heard Yesterday.

He Xing Real Estate Company, located at 444 Beijing Road, constructed residences at No. 612, Di Die Lane, and several street-facing shops along Tiantong Road before the "August 13th" Incident. Egg merchant Dai Huaiqin, wanting to open an egg shop there, paid a gratuity of 3,600 yuan and a deposit of 320 yuan to rent five interconnected shikumen houses from the real estate company at Nos. 624, 626, and 628 Tiantong Road and No. 9 inside Lane 612. Construction of these houses was halted due to the Shanghai War and resumed when the war shifted westward, finally completing in January of the Republic of China year 27 (1938). At that time, due to a shortage of eggs, Dai Huaiqin only opened the Xing Tai Egg Company at No. 628 Tiantong Road on February 1st of the same year, using No. 9 in the lane as a residence. Although Dai Huaiqin rented the street-facing shops at Nos. 624 and 626 Tiantong Road, she sub-rented them, through the introduction of a rent collector from He Xing Real Estate Company, to Huang Kecheng, owner of the Little Luzon Hat Shop on Fourth Avenue, to operate the Standard Coal Briquette Factory. Dai Huaiqin had spent over 5,000 yuan on gratuities, deposits, and renovations when renting the premises, so she sub-rented to Huang Kecheng for 100 yuan per month (including taxes), with a fixed term of one year. Dai Huaiqin's lease with He Xing Real Estate Company was an indefinite lease. The lease agreements were effective from February of the Republic of China year 27 (1938). Huang Kecheng's Standard Coal Briquette Factory also opened in February of the same year. Later, Dai Huaiqin, finding the original location insufficient, wanted to reclaim the premises sub-rented to Huang Kecheng for her own use. Although the lease had expired, Huang Kecheng refused to move out. After legal proceedings, the two parties reached a settlement, but Huang Kecheng still did not move out by the end of April of last year. Dai Huaiqin had no choice but to sue Huang Kecheng. Huang Kecheng lost the lawsuit and then offered to rent the premises directly from He Xing Real Estate Company. He Xing Real Estate Company then sued Dai Huaiqin for eviction, claiming that the lease term was two years. However, the court found that the lease agreement had been altered, so He Xing Real Estate Company lost again. Later, He Xing Real Estate Company filed another petition with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting an order for Dai Huaiqin's eviction, arguing that Dai Huaiqin had sublet the entire premises and invited the third-party tenant Huang Kecheng and others to testify. The original trial ruled against Dai Huaiqin. Dai, dissatisfied with the ruling, recently hired lawyer Yan Yinwu to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Judge Jia held a hearing to investigate. The appellant, Dai Huaiqin, and her lawyer insisted that the appellant had leased street-facing shops at Nos. 624, 626, and 628 Tiantong Road and a two-bay residence at No. 9 in Lane 612 from the appellee, He Xing Real Estate Company. Except for the sub-rental of Nos. 624 and 626, the appellant used all the remaining premises and never sublet the entire premises. There was no provision in the lease agreement prohibiting sub-rental. Furthermore, in August of the Republic of China year 27 (1938), the appellee was notified by registered mail about the third-party tenants building a mezzanine. The appellee never objected. How can they now claim ignorance of the appellant's sub-rental of the premises? The court also questioned the appellee's side and announced a postponement for further hearings.

### 法巡房昨破獲　轉竊布匹賊黨　抄出臟布五百餘疋
French Police Raid Yesterday, Busting a Gang Stealing and Reselling Fabrics, Seizing Over Five Hundred Bolts of Stolen Fabric.

French Police Chief Inspector Li Xianyang, along with Inspectors Lü Zhuke, Dai Rongyan, Detectives Zhang Dongcheng, Tan Yangsheng, He Xiaopei, and others, learned that a gang of thieves had established an organization in Nanyongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, specializing in stealing fabrics. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, they went to raid the area. At Nos. 35 and 36 of the lane, they arrested five men and three women, including the thief Sun Xuedao, and seized over thirty bolts of fabric in the kitchen, taking them all back to the police station. Subsequently, based on the confessions of the suspects, they rushed to No. 6 Dexing Lane, Baliliqiao Street, and arrested three Anhui natives, including Long Zhenxing (38 years old), seizing over five hundred bolts of stolen fabric, worth over 10,000 yuan. After investigation, the police learned that the fabrics were all from the Hengfeng Fabric Factory. The factory had, a few days ago, dispatched a truck fully loaded with fabrics to the Taikoo Wharf, when the gang of thieves took the opportunity to steal them.

It was also learned that the Hengfeng Company on Sichuan Road, No. 126 Alley in the English Concession, had recently reported the theft of a large quantity of fabrics, valued at over 10,000 yuan, to the Public Concession police, requesting an investigation. The French Concession police have now discovered that the gang of thieves involved in this case were hiding at No. 35 Nanyongji Lane, Wangzhi Road. They rushed to the address the night before last and arrested a person named Shen and seized over twenty bolts of stolen fabric. According to Shen's confession, the mastermind, Long Zhengxing, resided at No. 36 Kunlin Lane. The detectives then arrested Long and eleven other accomplices and seized an additional fifty or so bolts of stolen fabric, totaling twelve suspects and the stolen goods. After investigation, Long Zhengxing confessed to masterminding the theft, and Shen and the other eleven also confessed to participating in the theft, admitting that several other accomplices were still at large. The detectives reported this information to the head of the police, who, considering that the crime occurred within the English Concession, ordered the twelve suspects and all the stolen goods to be transferred to the Central Police Station of the English Concession for further investigation, to pursue the remaining accomplices and send them to the First Special District Court for prosecution.

In the middle, HSBC bought US dollars for this month at 5 yuan 5625/10000, and the securities firm Detefu poured in, once flying from 6,350 yuan to 6,398 yuan.

Finally, as the foreign exchange changed little, the securities firms sold again, dropping to 6,372 yuan at the close, a squeeze of 30 yuan compared to the previous day. The rise and fall for the day were 48 yuan. The price of the company's gold cards and "Haxia Chi" were the same. Receiving at a low of 40 yuan, the current standard gold price was 560 yuan lower than the listed gold price. There were few open transactions.

### 飾金尙無更動
There is No Change in Gold Ornaments.

The price of silver ornaments from silver shops remained unchanged. It is estimated that Da Tonghang, Xin Tonghang, and others still hung at 650 yuan, and the receiving price was reduced by 30 yuan.

### 外幣微降
Foreign Currencies Decline Slightly.

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the "Haxia Chi" market sentiment, hovered and trended lower. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan. British gold tickets remained flat, and the market price stood still. The American gold tickets followed the downward trend, once retreating to 17 yuan and 8 jiao 6 fen, and finally to 17 yuan and 9 jiao, a squeeze of 1 jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets fell and then returned to flat. Japanese gold tickets had even supply and demand, and the market price stood still. The evening market still stood at 1 yuan 6 jiao on the original price. Korean tickets trended lower again, retreating to 1 yuan 2 jiao in the evening market.

### 糧食　洋峭至昨始漸納軌　各米大都已在限價上　粳米亦隨之回落兩元零
Food: Imported "Yang Qiao" Rice Gradually Comes Under Control Yesterday. Most Rice is Already Above the Price Limit. Japonica Rice Also Falls Back Two Yuan Plus.

Rice brokers, after being ordered to suspend entry for two weeks, yesterday completed their term and resumed trading. These brokers, having been warned, now have a stricter association organization, and management methods all comply with regulations. They refuse all improper trading on commission and will immediately report it, so it is difficult for general hoarding households to cause trouble. Moreover, the concession authorities have started to thoroughly investigate inventories, which makes them uneasy. Therefore, with this shallow hope, they have successively released the large quantities of inventory that they were previously unwilling to release, "breaking the silence of the past month and becoming lively." Saigon No. 1 and 2, and Siam No. 3, which have long been unseen, opened early. Not only were they related to the scarcity of goods, but they were still set at the follow-up price, with the new evaluation having already limited it to a one-yuan decrease. Therefore, from the high of 77 yuan to the low of 74 yuan, rice, mung beans, broken rice, and polished rice have also been evaluated at a two-yuan decrease. Tea rice opened at 75 yuan, broken rice high from 72 yuan and 70 yuan, settled at 69 yuan, Tokyo polished pointed rice at 76 yuan and a half, down two or three yuan from the previous market. If we look at the black market, the premium price for the previous hoarding has depreciated by four or five yuan, which is truly a good sign that the rice market has not seen in recent months. The reason for this severe drop is that the shipments scheduled for both the morning and the evening are too many, and people's hearts have already become weak. In addition, the Rice Company Association was assigned to supply 30,000 bags of Saigon No. 2 to the industry, which has already oversupplied. Furthermore, after the brokers resumed their presence, they frantically promoted sales to store customers, and the floating households who profited were willing to sell. Therefore, the high prices of all kinds of rice plummeted in unison. Then, because there was news in the market that the Thai-Vietnamese war was expanding, the market began to stabilize. The selling prices of various kinds of rice are still on the price limit line. Small twists and broken rice are sold within the new evaluation. The return cargo has seen a sharp drop. Small twist, December 9th loaded, small bag 88-89 yuan. New transactions included Heyi Saigon No. 1, February, 90 yuan 02 jiao, totaling 1,000 tons. Shenji Small twist, 7,500 tons, January 15th loading, was 82 yuan 78 jiao, with 300 tons of returned original bags transacted.

Thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice, in this environment where sales are sluggish and selling intentions are loose, the market follows the imported rice and falls by more than two yuan. It is estimated that Kunshan Hu's white japonica saw 103 yuan to 100 yuan, Qingjiao Hu's thin rice saw 97-8 yuan, high 99 yuan, original bag 102 yuan.

Imported rice continues to arrive. Yesterday, the Jihe Foreign Company's Fuluxun ship arrived with 2,209 bags from Hong Kong, berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Zu) The price of flour has fallen slightly.

### 麵粉
Flour. Yesterday's imported flour market saw a slight decline, probably because the drop in rice prices had some impact on the current flour sales. Local customers and entrants all intended to wait for an opportunity to buy again. Wild Boar and Beautiful Brand imported flour were held back with little trading. Only Flower Bird Clock Tower flour was slightly favored by the local market, with less than 5,000 bags transacted. Clock Tower Brand declined from 24 yuan, 3 jiao and a half to 24 yuan. Flower Bird Brand has secretly loosened to within 24 yuan. The situation is quite soft. However, in the afternoon, news spread that the Thai-Vietnamese situation was beneficial, and people's hearts returned to stability. Plain-priced flour was still sold at 21 yuan and 5 jiao, plus 3 jiao for other miscellaneous expenses, with 3,000 bags supplied by the two factories.

Imported flour continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, another 7,200 bags were imported by the Jihe Foreign Company's Fuluxun ship from Hong Kong.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat trading remained in a state of stalemate. Because the current inventory is exhausted, the owners are trying to raise prices, and the factories are unwilling to lower prices to buy again because they want to buy goods without any. Therefore, both sides are still mutually holding back. It is heard that the Japanese factories have slightly received some retail purchases, at a price of 29 yuan and 5 jiao.

### 油餅　豆餅投機　交易猖狂
Oilcake: Soybean Cake Speculation, Transactions Rampant.

In recent days, soybean cake speculation and transactions have been quite rampant. Rice and oil worms are all frightened by it, using it as a tool for bulls and bears. Yesterday, Changzhou Feizi brand cakes were sold for delivery in the first half of January for three vehicles, Chayuan Long cakes for seven vehicles, and Xingji cakes for 8,000 pieces. Lizi brand cakes were sold for delivery in March for 5,000 pieces. As a result of the competition between the two sides, the sellers had a slight advantage, and the market price was down two or three jiao from before.

### 證券　公債市况兔起鶻落　結果仍是漲多跌少
Securities: Government Bonds Market Situation Rises and Falls Sharply, Resulting in More Rises Than Falls.

The government bond black market had a very turbulent situation yesterday, rising and falling sharply, with a difference of about one yuan in the high and low, which seemed to indicate a change. Whether this will cause a turnaround is not necessarily certain, but at least there will be no drastic decline. It is inevitable that bulls will be too crowded and come out when prices are high, because the increase since the New Year has been as high as four or five yuan. It is not very easy to reach 70 yuan in one fell swoop. Even if it can be reached, it will inevitably go through several detours and gradually reach its destination. An overly rapid advance will inevitably suffer setbacks, which is the norm of things. There are no major flaws in the environment, but the trading floor is gradually reaching a saturation point, and only absorbing without releasing is only a minority. The transactions yesterday by the two firms, Xinfu and Tongkang, still adhered to their consistent style, continuously absorbing in the morning and afternoon, but Lemao and No. 16 sold out at high prices, and various firms saw very active sellers following suit. For a time, the high and low prices differed by about one yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was the one quoted by the Wantai Firm, which was 68 yuan and 9 jiao, a new high price. For a time, selling accounts rose up like bees and declined in a straight line, closing at the lowest price of the afternoon. However, the result was still a rise of one or two jiao compared to the previous day. Type A, on the other hand, fell by a small two jiao. Type D rose by 7 jiao in the afternoon due to rice trading. The total number of transactions was 3.56 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock trading: 50 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded, at a price of 9 yuan and 2 jiao.

The stock market had a large rise and fall throughout the day, with sellers having a relatively large advantage, but at the close, short positions rose again to cover, and at the same time, new investors were also active. The underlying potential was still good. The dramatic changes in the market situation were caused by various rumors. There were extremely many transactions. Rubber stocks and industrial stocks lacked progress.

London, 8th (Wednesday) dispatch. Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debts and Far East British companies' stocks were all flat and sluggish, and the market situation generally remained unchanged.

### 紗花　總結束期漸近　沙市反覺安靜
Yarn and Cotton: The End of the Year is Approaching, the Yarn Market Feels Quiet.

The yarn market is still in a state of uncertainty, but the trend is more stable. As a result, the range of rise and fall is within ten yuan. Because of the relationship between the lunar year and the approaching end of the year, both the long and short sides are preparing to wait for the spring to decide the outcome, so the market trading is not as prosperous as it used to be. As for the actual demand, it is even more idle. The highest price of 20-count Double Horse yarn once saw 1,358 yuan, and the low was 1,345 yuan. The afternoon market was calm, starting at 1,355 yuan, then 1,352 yuan. Transactions were few.

The opening market situation of Double Horse was flat in the morning, and the atmosphere was friendly, but the psychology of the public opened high and tended to sell. The opening price was 1,355 yuan. At this time, the market was not tight, and the hat-snatching orders and floating longs probably sold out. At the same time, there was not much change in foreign exchange, and the market gradually fell to 1,345 yuan. The price was slightly weak, and sellers were not strong. Shorts profited and covered, and it was rumored that the price of gold had risen slightly. The situation suddenly became tense, and it suddenly rose to 1,358 yuan. However, the current sales were not strong, and the closing price saw a setback of several yuan, to 1,353 yuan. It is estimated that the half-day transaction statistics were 5,760 bales. The market situation of 20-count Double Horse yarn had no major changes. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows.

Same trade 5,600, Hong Kong 130, Ningbo 30. Statistics 5,760.

### 棉市亦無上下
Cotton Market Also Unchanged.

The current cotton situation has no great ups and downs to distinguish. This is because the end of the year is approaching, so the factories' needs are still not developing. However, the flower companies have slightly made some mutual purchases and decorations. However, the market price has not changed much. Yesterday, 41 bales of cotton came from Hong Kong.

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is active. First, because of purchases from the same industry, and then because of the increase in domestic raw cotton consumption, and the good spot transactions, the closing price was more than ten pounds higher than the previous day, up to more than twenty pounds. India's quick forecast also rose by more than one rupee.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has continued to be exceptionally quiet in recent days. The purchases from all parties are very weak, and the transactions in the same industry are also rare. All are holding a wait-and-see attitude.

### 疋頭　實銷雖清　廠盤不賤
Piece Goods: Although Actual Sales Are Clear, Factory Prices Are Not Cheap.

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was slightly higher, because although actual sales were clear, the same trade and customer gangs were very lively in their transactions. The cheap inventory on the market gradually cleared. This was because the factory prices were not cheap, and people's hearts were determined. The selling market was generally flat. Some of the scarce goods rose by one or two jiao per bolt. The Shui Street traded more than 600 pieces of various fabrics, Zhejiang-Fujian gang handled more than 200 pieces of dyed cloth, pongee, and coarse and fine cloth, Guangdong-Hong Kong gang handled more than 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, and the Nanyang gang handled more than 5,000 bolts of bleached cloth, khaki, etc.

Eastern Cloth: Initial flatness, then firmness. White goods

### British Air Force Bravely Bombs Elbasan in Rain and Snow; Greek Frontline Troops Make Steady Progress; Large Numbers of Italian Troops Reinforce Albanian Territory

Athens: A Royal Air Force communique states that British aircraft bravely braved heavy rain and snow to effectively bomb the Italian command headquarters and military depots in Elbasan, the central location of Italian command in Albania. High-explosive and incendiary bombs continuously rained down on the military buildings, causing numerous large fires. All British aircraft returned safely after completing their mission. It is also reported that several squadrons of Italian low-flying bombers and fighter planes were deployed yesterday, attempting to impede the advance of the Greek army on all fronts. However, the fiercely brave and skilled Greek Evzones, mountain cavalry, and other infantry continued their fierce fighting without pause. A Greek official spokesman stated that the operations of the Greek forward posts have consistently achieved satisfactory results and that the Greek army continues to maintain its dominant position. The spokesman also said that according to various reports received by the Greek command, the fighting in the central Këlcyrë area is fierce, and many Italian troops have been captured in the northern region. The spokesman denied reports of Italian troops repelling the Greek army's attack on the Pogradec area, stating that Italian troops were repelled by the Greek army while counter-attacking the advancing Greek troops, leaving twenty corpses on the battlefield and fleeing. The spokesman continued, stating that the Italian troops in a certain area along the coast north of Sarandë have been completely cleared. Italian troops were unable to escape and were all captured by the Greek army. In addition, the Greek army has also occupied important and heavily fortified positions in the mountains of Mokra. Furthermore, a Greek army communique stated, "In local battles, our army has captured 300 Italian troops and countless military supplies, including many automatic rifles and mortars. Our air force has also bombed the enemy and strafed them with machine guns, shooting down three Italian planes. Our air force returned safely to base after the operations." Also, a Ministry of Public Security communique stated that Italian aircraft bombed Thessaloniki in northeastern Greece, but there were no casualties and the damage was not significant. A correspondent from the United Press accompanying the Italian troops in the Mokra Mountains reported that the fascist army is now using new heavy artillery capable of firing sixteen miles on railways, hoping to counter-attack and expand its activities (United Press dispatch on the 9th). Athens: Athens Radio reports that 35,000 Italian troops boarded ships from Vlorë yesterday, indicating that the Italian situation is very discouraging. From Pogradec to the coastal area, Greek troops are making steady progress without resistance. Between Tepelenë and Këlcyrë, Greek troops have made some new gains, and the Italian troops in that area are in dire straits (United Press dispatch on the 9th). Vichy: According to a report from a French Times correspondent stationed on the Italian border, the Italian side has dispatched reinforcements, transporting them by sea and air across the Strait of Otranto to Albania (Reuters dispatch on the 9th).

### Strong Consciousness Among People in Free China Areas; Unprecedented Unity and Solidarity; Astonishing Developments in Various Constructions; Mr. Fei, Returned from a Tour, Gave a Speech at the Rotary Club Yesterday

Mr. Fei, a Western staff member of the YMCA, recently returned to Shanghai from Free China. Yesterday, he gave a speech at the local Rotary Club, sharing his observations. He stated that he had witnessed astonishing progress in Free China, which was due to the continuous striving of the people. Therefore, he did not believe that any other country in the world could demonstrate better results than China.

Building a Railway in Sixty Days

Mr. Fei visited Kunming twice, once three years ago when he only saw one yarn factory there. When he returned to Kunming a year later, he found the place vibrant and completely different from before. There were no fewer than thirty-six large-scale factories, and many more were under construction. Mr. Fei went on to say that similar progress could be seen in other areas of Free China. The railway system between important cities was particularly developed. One railway, 137 miles long, was completed in just sixty days. People often say that Easterners work slowly, but based on what he has seen, this is actually inaccurate.

Unprecedented Unity and Solidarity

Mr. Fei then recounted his experiences of fleeing during Japanese bombing raids. When he traveled from Hong Kong to the mainland, he traveled secretly at night every day to avoid Japanese air raids. Although Japanese aircraft wreaked havoc everywhere, the people were determined, encouraging and urging each other on. He repeatedly heard people express their determination to persevere to the end, and he never saw anyone complaining. This was truly amazing. Mr. Fei said that he felt fortunate to witness the birth of a new China. Although there were rumors of various factional divisions, in reality, China's current unity and solidarity are unprecedented in history. He stated that this war is actually a blessing for China. Things that would have taken China several generations (thirty years being a generation) to achieve in peacetime are now being accomplished in three years.

Urgent Need for Aircraft Fuel and Gasoline

After Mr. Fei finished his speech, he told reporters that he believed China's greatest needs at the moment are transport vehicles, gasoline, fighter planes, and bombers. He said that the main reason for rising prices in China is the lack of adequate transportation facilities. Mr. Fei also told his fellow Rotarians that he had traveled extensively in the past three years to various provinces of China, as well as Annam, Siam, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and the United States. He said that the American people are very different from before. Previously, those who sympathized with isolationists accounted for nearly 80 percent, but now the entire country unanimously supports the government's policy of assisting democratic countries. Public opinion is even more advanced than the government on this point.

### British Electrical Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning; Trolleys on All Routes Restored; Temporary Police Precautions Have Been Lifted; Workers' Conditions Resolved Through Open Consultation

Workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramways Company in the International Settlement demanded improved treatment. After striking the previous morning, they accepted advice and resumed work yesterday morning. Trolleys and trackless trolleys on all routes within the Settlement were fully restored. All temporary police precautions were also lifted. The company has responded to the conditions put forward by the workers and has agreed to further open negotiations to resolve the issues. Tram services resumed simultaneously in the British and French concessions.

Entering the Factory Yesterday Morning to Resume Work

After the trolley workers accepted advice and agreed to resume work first while waiting for a legal solution, the labor side immediately dispatched staff to notify the workers the day before yesterday. As a result, machine workers and traffic workers all entered the factory to resume work at six o'clock yesterday morning, according to the company's scheduled shifts. At the same time, the Traffic Department dispatched personnel to schedule vehicles and prepare to restore trolley service. By eight o'clock yesterday morning, trolleys on all routes had completely left the factory and resumed operation. However, trackless trolleys on all routes were not fully restored until around nine o'clock. As for the trams in the British and French concessions, they also resumed mutual service.

Traffic Restored, Precautions Lifted

The various temporary police precautions at the general office of the trolley company on North Suzhou Road, as well as the Jing'an Temple Station on Hardoon Road and the general materials depot on Route Doumer, were lifted immediately after the workers resumed work. The barbed wire and other barricades in front of Jing'an Temple Station have been removed. After the trolleys and trackless trolleys in the International Settlement completely left the factory and resumed operation, public transport within the Settlement was fully restored. Public buses have suspended the addition of vehicles on various public bus routes. Shanghai citizens, seeing that the trolley services have been restored, all hope that both labor and management should embrace a spirit of cooperation to seek reasonable improvements in workers' treatment. The workers' strike and suspension of trolley services have a profound impact on traffic.

Labor and Management Consult to Resolve Conditions

A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from the workers' side yesterday that regarding the conditions put forward by the workers, in addition to the second condition regarding year-end bonuses and special bonuses which has been negotiated and resolved, and the fifth condition that the company agreed to increase ticket sellers on trackless trolley routes 14 and 15, the remaining conditions including the first condition of increasing wages by 50 percent, the third condition that drivers, coppersmiths, and ticket sellers would receive wage increases every four days, and the fourth condition that the company would deduct the welfare contributions payable to the union when paying workers' wages, have been submitted to the board of directors for review. Further open negotiations will be held to resolve the issues. It is heard that the company is making every effort to improve workers' treatment so that they can maintain their current livelihoods.

### Shanghai's Savings for Nation-Building Exceed 10 Million Yuan; Ranking Third in the Country; Headquarters Has Telegraphed Encouragement to the Promotion Agencies; Principal and Interest of the Savings Are Extremely Safe and Generous

Since the National General Association for Savings for Nation-Building launched the savings for nation-building campaign, all regions have responded and promoted it enthusiastically. All provinces and cities across the country, as well as government and commercial banks and postal remittance bureaus, have accepted savings for nation-building. The four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) and provincial and municipal banks, postal remittance bureaus, etc., have issued savings bonds for the campaign with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The total amount of savings stored nationwide last year has exceeded the predetermined amount of 200 million yuan. Regarding the isolated island of Shanghai, although savings bonds for nation-building are temporarily not publicly sold due to the special circumstances, various banks have agreed to purchase savings bonds from Hong Kong on behalf of customers and handle savings for nation-building. The citizens of the isolated island have spared no effort in promoting the savings movement, and the amount subscribed by the end of last year was 11 million yuan, ranking third among all regions in the country. The General Association deeply appreciated the citizens of Shanghai and sent a telegram to the Shanghai promotion agencies to commend them. It is heard that the majority of the subscribed funds in Shanghai are savings deposits, followed by savings bonds. In addition to the assets invested with the savings as the primary guarantee, and the issuing bank being directly responsible to the depositors, the safety of the principal and interest of these savings is guaranteed by the government. The utilization of the savings is carried out entirely in accordance with Article 5 of the Regulations on Savings for Nation-Building.

### Western Newspaper Reports Workers Did Not Make Demands

The English-language "China Press" reports that the workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramways Company abruptly ended their lightning strike this morning (9th) and resumed work together at 7:45 am, which was unexpected and quite astonishing. It was previously expected that this labor dispute would be prolonged or even spread to other public transport companies in the city. This expectation has now been disproven. However, the most surprising thing this morning is that the workers did not make any demands to the company, nor did they explain the reason for the strike. A member of the British trolley company emphatically denied this morning that the workers had made any demands. According to him, there is no basis to the Chinese newspapers' report that the workers made five demands. The company is greatly puzzled by the workers' sudden strike because it has not yet been able to ascertain the motivation behind it. Now that the workers have unconditionally resumed work, it is quite gratifying.

### The Truth About Du Chongyuan's Detention in Xinjiang

After Du Chongyuan was detained in Xinjiang by the provincial government chairman Sheng Shicai, Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, and others sent telegrams to inquire about rescuing him. It is heard that Chairman Sheng has telegraphed back to Huang and others about the detention process, stating that it is related to politics and that Du was attempting to undermine the rear in Xinjiang. The evidence is conclusive. Please explain the situation in detail to Du's relatives and friends. If Du's relatives and friends have any doubts about this case and want to come to Xinjiang to see the evidence, they are welcome to do so.

### The Increase in Rates by the Shanghai Municipal Council Will Exacerbate Inflation; Contradicting the Policy of Suppressing Inflation; The Ratepayers' Meeting Should Give Serious Consideration

The four million citizens of Shanghai are under high price pressure and have no room to breathe. The sudden news that the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to increase rates by 40 percent starting on the first day of this year is like a bolt from the blue, causing great shock. A certain ratepayer told reporters yesterday that the soaring prices in Shanghai have already reached a serious level, and all those who care about social order are taking it as a hidden danger. Now, in order to meet its exchange rate subsidies and other expenses, the Municipal Council is making unlimited rate increases, which is completely contrary to its usual policy of suppressing inflation. Why not select Chinese staff for such large Western personnel exchange subsidies? The orchestra setting is already criticized by public opinion, why not resolutely remove it? The most serious reflection of the rate increase is the further increase in rents. Landlords increase land taxes, and landlords increase rates, which are ultimately passed on to tenants. The increase in various license fees also comes from the general public. It is expected that high price pressure will be intensified by the rate increases. How can we, the small people, bear it? We have nothing else to say but to hope that the Municipal Council will pay special attention to the public's ability to bear the burden when discussing rate increases at the special Ratepayers' Meeting.

### Sincere Consultation on Five Labor-Management Disputes; Resolution of Knitting Worker Strike

The telegraph operators of the Pacific, Great Eastern, and Great Northern Telegraph Bureaus requested that the authorities increase their salaries. Since the incident occurred on the 6th, the bureau and representatives of the telegraph operators had an hour-long conversation yesterday, and there is now a glimmer of hope. According to the telegraph operators, the demands they made this time were a last resort. They are well aware of the complex current situation and the difficulties they face. Therefore, they maintained a upright position and made reasonable demands in a sincere manner, and they hoped that the bureau would understand their difficulties.

Dockworkers Strike Mediation

The Suzhou Creek dockworkers' strike has been going on for four days since its launch. In order to avoid further expansion of the incident, the person in charge of the labor union scheduled a meeting yesterday morning to mediate between labor and management. Because the management did not attend, the mediation failed and was rescheduled for the morning of the 11th of this month, hoping to end the strike as soon as possible. Yesterday noon, representatives from various offices specially prepared 5,000 steamed buns and went to distribute them to the striking workers to express their condolences. Yesterday, the branches of all docks in the city, including 80,000 workers, held a joint meeting at the Shanghai Dockworkers' Union and resolved: (1) To establish a support committee and take unified action; (2) Workers at all docks in the city will provide as much spiritual and material assistance as possible. Knitting Workers Resume Work

More than 300 engineers and technicians belonging to 129 electrical knitting sock factories in the city put forward various demands, including improved treatment and increased cost-of-living allowances. The matter was fully resolved at 9:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. The management has accepted all the conditions put forward by the labor side and both parties have signed a contract.

Postal Workers' Deadline for Reply

The Shanghai Postal Administration and all its branches in the city's postmen and deliverymen, etc., last November submitted a request to Director-General Chaplim, requesting that the Kunming General Office increase the cost-of-living allowance by 50 percent, and the year-end double salary allowance should also be included. Chaplim immediately telegraphed the General Office, but due to postal delays, he did not receive any information. Later, he telegraphed again to urge them. The General Office telegraphed back, agreeing to increase the allowance by 25 percent, which must be formally approved by the Ministry of Communications. It is now known that all employees of the Shanghai Bureau are feeling increasingly difficult in their livelihoods and have telegraphed again, setting a deadline for a satisfactory reply by next Tuesday.

Taxi Worker Strike

All office staff and drivers of the four major taxi companies in the city, including Xiang Sheng, Yun Fei, Tailai, and Yinse, had previously asked the company authorities to increase their salaries and allowances. The political department of the Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession once came forward to mediate, but the two sides insisted on their own views and reached a stalemate. According to reliable sources from the News Agency yesterday, the employees of the four major taxi companies once convened a meeting at around 5:00 p.m. yesterday.

### The "Fang Dan" Tax Case Continued Yesterday

The case of four wealthy Chinese gentlemen, Wan Jiaping, Hu Jingwan, Zhu Ruiqing, and Fang Wende, suing the Municipal Council over the "Fang Dan" land tax was held for the second continued hearing in the Consular Court yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Council Committee Hall. At that time, the defendant's lawyer, Boyland, attacked the second plaintiff, Hu Jingfang, in a similar manner to his attack on the first plaintiff, Fang Jiaping, during the first hearing the day before.

Boyland stated that you (the plaintiffs) receive all the benefits and protection provided by the Municipal Council, but are unwilling to pay land tax to maintain the Municipal Council's expenses. Furthermore, since the plaintiffs do not pay land tax to the Municipal Council, they have also not paid taxes to the Chinese government. Regarding this point, although the second plaintiff, Hu Jingfang, was unable to produce tax receipts from the Chinese government, he denied not paying taxes to the government. Boyland then mentioned that the plaintiffs had requested the Lawyers' Association to forward the case to the Chongqing government, attempting to use political pressure to win the case. The plaintiffs did not answer because this matter was not within the scope of the law. Boyland continued, saying that the ownership of the "Fang Dan" held by the second plaintiff, Hu Jingfang, was questionable. The plaintiff replied that assuming the ownership of the land does not belong to me, then the Municipal Council should not collect tax from me even more so. After some questions and answers that were not related to the case, Boyland asked the plaintiff whether the "Fang Dan" he possessed was picked up from the street. The plaintiff replied that it was inherited from his ancestors. Finally, the plaintiff's lawyer, Liu Shifang, stated that more than forty years ago, when the Public Concession expanded to the boundary of the plaintiff Hu Jingfang's property, there were no regulations on collecting land tax. Six years ago, when the plaintiff built a house and started paying house tax, the Municipal Council did not request the collection of land tax.

### Another Rice Merchant Transacted Beyond the Limit and Was Sentenced to Ten Months Imprisonment; Da Dexing Company Increased Prices and Sold Twice

In order to stabilize the rice market, the Shanghai Municipal Council strictly enforces the price limits of the Price Evaluation Committee and prosecutes rice merchants who hoard, speculate, manipulate, and sell rice above the price limit. Recently, a rice merchant named Zhang Junlong was sentenced to ten months in prison for exceeding the price limit by a court. Now, in order to thoroughly investigate the matter, the political department of the Municipal Council has dispatched a large number of detectives to various rice shops and warehouses to investigate inventory and sales prices. On the 25th of last month, Mao Guobao, a Chinese detective of the department, investigated the ledgers of the Da Dexing Grain Shop at No. 676 Zhejiang Road and found that on the 21st, ten bags of No. 1 Gongmi rice were sold for 92.5 yuan, exceeding the price limit of 5.5 yuan per dan. There were also ten bags of GK No. 2 Saigon rice sold for 87 yuan, but the ledger was changed to No. 1 Saigon to meet the price limit (because the price limit for No. 1 Gong rice was 87 yuan, and the price limit for No. 2 Saigon rice was 81.5 yuan). In fact, it also exceeded 5.5 yuan per dan. He then reported it to the First Special District Court and obtained an arrest warrant. The previous day, the manager of the shop, Gao Hanting from Wuxi, was arrested by Detective Mao. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court.
