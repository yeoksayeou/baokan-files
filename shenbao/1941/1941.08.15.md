### Roosevelt-Churchill Talks Concluded: Anglo-American Joint Declaration Issued: Wishing Invaded Nations to Restore Autonomous Governments, Resolving to Reduce Armaments and Maintain Lasting Peace; Beaverbrook to Visit the US to Discuss Details of Lend-Lease

Reuters, London, 14th - Acting Prime Minister Attlee today made a statement that people have been eagerly awaiting. President Roosevelt of the United States and Prime Minister Churchill, representing the British government, met at sea. Officials from both governments accompanied them, including senior personnel from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The US President and the Prime Minister held several meetings, considering the danger posed to world civilization by the military control policies of the German Hitler government and its vassal governments. They also stated the steps that Britain and the US should take in response to this danger. Both sides agreed to issue the following joint declaration:

The US President and the British Prime Minister, having met, believe that some common principles of their national policies should be stated: (1) Neither country seeks aggrandizement, territorial or other; (2) Neither country desires to see any territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; (3) They respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them; (4) They will endeavor to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity; while respecting existing obligations; (5) They desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and social security; (6) After the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want; (7) Such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance; (8) They believe that all of the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers. They believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments. Both sides also continued to study all issues stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act regarding the supply of arms to Britain and all countries actively resisting aggression. British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook will participate in this discussion and will travel to Washington to discuss the details with US officials, which will further include the issue of supplies to the Soviet Union.

Reuters, London, 14th - Acting Prime Minister and Lord Privy Seal Attlee's remarks tonight, in addition to being broadcast on the British Broadcasting Corporation's domestic and overseas programs, will also be rebroadcast in the Americas by the American Broadcasting System. The British Broadcasting Corporation will also broadcast this statement in various dialects and in foreign language broadcasts. United Press, London, 14th - Officials announced today that Churchill and his entourage of 23 people left England in great secrecy, so that even some of his party did not know their destination.

### Philippine Resident Commissioner to the US Broadcast Speech Advocating US Policy

United Press, Washington, 14th - Philippine Resident Commissioner to the US, Elisa Ysalte, broadcast to the entire United States last night, saying that the Filipino people are deeply aware that unless democratic countries win in the current great war, they will never be able to realize their ideal of independence. The Philippine people have already decided to support the United States in any event. It is essential to maintain the status quo in the China Sea area. If we allow this area to be controlled by imperialist countries through appeasement, the efforts of the United States and other democratic countries to preserve the free world will be greatly harmed. At risk now is the free trade of the entire world and the export of important raw materials to the United States.

### Roosevelt and Churchill Write to Stalin Reaffirming Their Determination to Aid the Soviet Union

United Press, London, 14th - Reliable sources revealed today that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill jointly wrote to Stalin, expressing their admiration for the Soviet Union's position and reaffirming their determination to provide the Soviet Union with all possible assistance.

Havas, Washington, 14th - The White House announced that President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, British Minister of Supply Beaverbrook, and British and American staff officers recently held a meeting somewhere at sea.

United Press, Washington, 14th - Well-informed sources said yesterday that as soon as President Roosevelt returns from his trip, a second Lend-Lease program worth approximately 600 million yuan will be submitted to Congress. Observers believe that a large portion of the funds will be used to purchase food, and the rest will be used to purchase large and medium-sized bombers, ammunition, and artillery.

### Japanese Minister of State Kiichirō Hiranuma Assassinated: Assailant Claimed to Seek Autographed Calligraphy; Made an Appointment to Visit, Then Opened Fire; Hiranuma Injured While Pursuing the Assailant, Nishiyama, Who Was Apprehended

United Press, Tokyo, 14th - Japanese Minister of State Kiichirō Hiranuma was assassinated at his private residence today, suffering a gunshot wound. Police announced the assailant's name as Nishiyama, 35 years old, who claimed to be seeking Hiranuma's autographed calligraphy and made an appointment to visit. Unexpectedly, he used a handgun to shoot.

Shot in the neck, Hiranuma, despite being injured, pursued the assailant to the gate, where the guards apprehended him. At 1:00 PM, the Emperor dispatched imperial physician Matsunaga to examine him, and he and the Empress jointly sent several baskets of fruit. Prime Minister Konoe and other senior government officials also visited Hiranuma's private residence. Police investigating the case did not allow newspapers to publish the matter until 1:00 PM in the afternoon.

According to Domei News Agency, the Tokyo District Criminal Court Prosecutor's Office announced that this attempted assassination occurred at 8:00 AM today at Hiranuma's home. The Prosecutor's Office reported that Ishiya visited Hiranuma at 8:00 AM. While the two were talking in the reception room of Hiranuma's home, Ishiya suddenly drew a

handgun and opened fire. The Prosecutor's Office did not disclose Hiranuma's condition. Hiranuma was appointed to form a cabinet on January 5, 1939, after the collapse of the first Konoe cabinet, but his cabinet also collapsed eight months later after the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. In Konoe's second cabinet, Hiranuma was appointed Minister of Home Affairs. In Konoe's third cabinet, Hiranuma remained in the cabinet as a Minister of State. Hiranuma, 76 years old, has long been known as "Japan's number one fascist" and is the leader of the reactionary patriotic organization Kokusuikai, and an opponent of all liberalism. However, when he took office as Prime Minister on January 5, 1939, and in recent conversations, Hiranuma often stated that political parties should be able to have a say in the government and that the wishes of the people should be respected. His friends said that his

change of heart was due to his advanced age. Hiranuma has always been single, which is rare in Japan, because arranging marriages for children is the most important obligation of Japanese parents. Hiranuma occasionally drinks, and he prefers Japanese sake to Western liquor. This is one aspect of Hiranuma's nationalistic tendencies, but he prefers to smoke British Westminster brand cigarettes instead of Japanese-made ones. Hiranuma came from a poor background and was born in Okayama Prefecture in northwestern Japan. In 1888, after graduating from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University, he entered the Ministry of Justice and rose through the ranks to become President of the Supreme Court. Although he held a

high position, he continued to study and teach law at Tokyo Imperial University. In 1907, the university awarded him a doctorate in law. In 1926, he was

granted the title of Baron. After Hiranuma became Minister of Justice, he entered the House of Peers. After receiving the title of nobility in 1926, he became Vice President of the Privy Council for ten consecutive years. The main reason why Hiranuma failed to become President of the Privy Council was his open opposition to Makino, the Emperor's top advisor. Makino was a liberal and was assassinated in the February 26 Incident in 1936. In the same year, Hiranuma was promoted to President of the Privy Council. Since then, Hiranuma has severed ties with the Kokusuikai. Several years ago, Hiranuma expressed his anti-Kokusuikai views, saying, "Fascism may be good in Italy, but I do not believe that fascism, communism, or Hitlerism is beneficial to Japan." Generally reliable sources said that Hiranuma

was shot in the eye, but the government refused to confirm this point this afternoon. Ishii, Deputy Spokesman of the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, stated, "Hiranuma is an important figure in Japan today, so a thorough investigation must be conducted before a formal statement can be made to the press."

### Special Party Branch of the Aviation Commission Issues Letter to Compatriots: Japanese Air Force Suffered Heavy Losses in the Past Four Years; Calls on Compatriots Nationwide to Build a New Air Force

Chongqing - Tomorrow, August 14th, is Air Force Day. The Special Party Branch and the Political Department of the Aviation Commission issued a letter to compatriots nationwide and a letter to overseas Chinese, calling on compatriots at home and abroad to build a new air force. (13th dispatch)

Chongqing - The Special Party Branch and Political Department of the Aviation Commission issued a letter to compatriots nationwide for Air Force Day, stating in part: Our Air Force has been in existence for a full four years. During these four years, a total of 2,054 Japanese aircraft have been shot down and destroyed by us, and a total of 2,650 Japanese air force personnel have been captured and killed by us. Many coastal commercial ports have been occupied, and the capital has been moved from Nanjing to Chongqing. The Jiaoqiao airfield has also been trampled upon, but our young Air Force has not only not been destroyed, but has grown and developed. It has made progress in both equipment and technology. The Japanese are carrying out a planned aggression, an aggression that has taken place after the Air Force has been established for twenty years. But our Air Force was only recently established, and the war of resistance has not affected its rapid growth. We acknowledge the inferiority of the Chinese Air Force, but because of our flexible use, we have achieved some victories. Today, our dark period has passed. Now, in the war of resistance against aggression, the great democratic countries such as China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are completely on our side. There is no doubt that final victory will belong to us. However, the future environment requires the use of subjective conditions, and the final victory requires the struggle of self-reliance. What is this subjective condition? In terms of the Air Force, the first is to contribute money and effort to support the Air Force vigorously and effectively. The second is the construction of a new Air Force. The Chinese Air Force is determined to shed blood, but hopes that compatriots across the country will have a timely understanding and rise up to assist the government in order to quickly promote the establishment of a large Air Force.

Editorial

### The Economic War in Asia

During the First World War, the Asian nations, except for a few who participated in destructive activities, the Chinese and Japanese countries were fortunate to avoid being drawn into the vortex, so the virgin economic strength of Asia was preserved. Today, the World War is being re-enacted, and its roots can be deduced from the first outbreak. The sharpness of weapons and the dedication of soldiers have been improved and demonstrated. It has stimulated all Asian nations to choose a line and participate in the war. The peaceful and benevolent Asian nations are divided into carrying spears and waiting for the arrival of death. Is this self-inflicted, or is it a liquidation of natural competition, and must all mankind go through this stage before reaching the other side? Regardless of how this matter develops, it will be difficult for the Asian people to maintain the status quo and order before the war, and this is what we should prepare for urgently.

Asia's abundant resources surpass the rest of the world, and our country is blessed with innate savings that everyone knows, but unfortunately, it has not been developed and utilized in time, resulting in long-standing attraction for foreign powers. This is why foreign aggression has become increasingly serious and will be completely resolved in the great war.

Recently, the Nazis divided the world into four self-sufficient countries based on the current distribution of economic resources: the Nazis rule all of Europe and Africa, the Soviet Union rules Central Asia and Siberia, the United States rules North and South America, and Japan rules the entire coastline of East Asia. This kind of arrogant dream should be dismissed, but it shows the goal of competing for economy at a glance. Recently, the South Pacific has shown a sword-drawing posture, which is on the verge of breaking out, which is enough to show that countries have been unbearable and will resort to force to solve the problem. What do human beings want to obtain from Asia? Let's try to say it.

The main resources of Asia that the Western countries rely on to maintain production include silk, tungsten, antimony, rubber, tin, manganese, etc. The United States uses about half of them. US steel, canned food, automobiles, and farm implement manufacturing plants require huge amounts of tin, and the production of tin must first transport Asian raw tin to the United Kingdom or the Netherlands for refining before transporting it to the United States. If all tin-producing areas are occupied by the Japanese army or the South Pacific route is cut off by the Japanese army, the US military industry will be greatly hit and will be shut down, because there is no effective remedy at present. Manganese and antimony also rely entirely on the supply of Asia. Although Cuba and Brazil have a slight production, they are of no avail, and there are no substitutes, so they are must-contend national defense raw materials. This is why the Burma Road has become an important international transportation line. As for tungsten and silk, there are substitutes, which are not a problem in the United States, and the United States can use this point to attack Japan. If the United States does not buy Japanese silk and then prohibits the export of oil to Japan, it will be enough to give Japan a heavy blow. Regarding the supply of rubber, Mexico and Brazil have a continuous supply, and there is no danger of interruption in the United States.

Now, what is the purpose of Japan's southward advance? Some commentators believe that Japan's coveting of the Dutch East Indies is to seize its large output of rubber, tin, and mineral oil to enrich its military raw materials, but in fact, it is not entirely the case. Vietnam and Thailand are both rubber-producing areas, each producing about 50,000 tons per year, and they can jointly produce 100,000 tons per year. Japan's military needs will not exceed 50,000 tons at most, so the output of one country is enough to supply Japan's consumption, and there is no need to search for it in the East Indies. Also, the tin production of the two countries is also enough to meet Japan's military needs. However, mineral oil is a natural specialty of the East Indies, and the output of the two countries is extremely small. This is one of the purposes of Japan's southward advance, which is undoubtedly. At the same time, intercepting the only international route for the export of tin, antimony, and manganese to hit the United States must also be one of its purposes. The United States can stop Japan from taking mineral oil from the East Indies, and Japan can also make a big fuss about preventing the United States from seizing its tin. As for the tin, antimony, and manganese produced on the Asian continent, it must be easily plundered by the Japanese army, and the United States will feel more difficult to fight back. The situation of the competition for economic resources in the South Pacific is probably like this.

Our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, and is endowed with the right time, place, and people, but unfortunately, it has not been used to its full potential, resulting in the covetous gaze of strong neighbors, which is indeed a pity. However, we not only have no stingy thoughts, but also advocate cooperation with countries that share the same goals to develop our country's resources for the common enjoyment of mankind. The point we strive for is that economic cooperation must be mutually beneficial and not one-sided. If we take aggressive actions and seize them by force, we will never tolerate it and must give them a powerful blow.

### The United States Transports 800,000 Tons of Supplies to China, Part of the US Aid Program to China; Cargo Transportation on the Burma Road Can Be Increased

Chongqing - According to sources in charge here, the United States is currently transporting 800,000 tons of supplies to China, which is part of the US aid program to China. US transportation experts stated after inspecting the Burma Road that the current cargo tonnage passing through the road can be doubled or even tripled. (14th Reuters dispatch)

### Chinese Students Studying in the United States Allowed to Travel by US

Chongqing - Due to the increasingly tense international situation, the US government ordered the President Shipping Company, which sails to the Far East, to prohibit ordinary Chinese passengers from traveling to the United States. Those holding official passports must also be handled by the company at its discretion. Only those holding diplomatic passports are not restricted. Many Chinese students who were going to study in the United States this summer were stranded in Hong Kong and could not depart. After learning of this matter, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately consulted with the US side. It has now received a reply from the US Embassy in Hong Kong stating that the US State Department has instructed the shipping company to allow Chinese students to buy tickets and take ships to the United States as usual.

### Military Commission Releases Weekly War Situation: August 8th to 14th

Chongqing - Weekly war situation, August 8th to 14th, the spokesman of the Military Commission said that this week the Japanese Air Force suddenly carried out long-term and extensive bombing in the cities of China's rear, especially in China's capital. According to the Japanese spokesman, its purpose is to achieve various fantasies and to make China submit: (1) Destroy the productivity of China's vast rear; (2) Attack the tenacity of China's anti-Japanese people; (3) Shake the stability and strengthening power of Chongqing, etc. The rest said that not only is there no tactical or strategic significance, but this kind of behavior is enough to show their boredom and entrapment in the quagmire. The various fantasies of Japan cannot be realized, but instead give China various gains, that is, in the spiritual aspect: (1) Exercise our physique to make it agile; (2) Strengthen our hatred of the enemy; in fact, (1) The Japanese side lost more aircraft, gasoline and personnel, and the Chinese side lost less houses and roads; (2) All the work on the Chinese side is still proceeding as usual and has not been affected in the slightest. It can be imagined that the newspapers that are clearly visible are still published every day as usual, and all other institutions can be imagined. It is a dream to solve the war in this way. As for the Japanese army, in the battle northeast of Yichang, except for a small part of the Japanese army near Caojiayu that was surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese, the rest have returned to their original positions. In this battle, a total of more than 5,000 Japanese were killed or wounded, and a large number of spoils of war were captured. It was the first victory of the Chinese army in western Hubei since the summer of this year. In the battle in the Jingzhou and Shashi area, Hao Xue was completely recovered by the 10th, and the Japanese retreated north to Cenhekou. The Japanese in Xinkou and Jinjiabu were also defeated and retreated north, abandoning a large number of military supplies along the way. On the south bank of Taihu Lake, a Chinese unit captured the Japanese stronghold of Xinchen Town northwest of Jiaxing on the evening of the 8th, killing and wounding more than 400 Japanese. The Chinese army captured 5 light machine guns, 148 rifles, and many other spoils of war. On the evening of the 6th, a Chinese unit in northern Hunan attacked the Japanese near Linxiang and bombed a Japanese army train, killing and wounding more than 300 Japanese and burning more than 400 barrels of Japanese gasoline. Other scattered war situations are omitted. (14th dispatch)

### Japanese Planes Re-attack Chongqing, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Yunnan Provinces All Attacked, Losses Everywhere Extremely Minor

Chongqing: Three waves of Japanese bombers, totaling one hundred and seventeen planes, flew over Chongqing for two and a half hours today, the seventh consecutive day of bombing. The attacks over the past few months have reached twenty-six times. The Japanese planes today still focused on the western city walls and the area between the already destroyed press club. The press club has been bombed repeatedly for two years, resulting in its destruction yesterday. A village one mile upstream in a safe zone on the south bank of the Yangtze River, as well as areas on the north bank of the Yangtze River and Jiangbei, one mile from the urban area, were all bombed by Japanese planes. The first wave of Japanese planes, totaling sixty-three, were divided into small groups and flew from all directions to bomb Chongqing for ten minutes. Three fires broke out, but were quickly extinguished. The Haitang Temple (transliteration) area near the safe zone was also bombed by twenty-three Japanese planes. A Chinese military spokesman said that these continuous air raids clearly show that the Japanese army needs to show combat performance in China due to its plan to advance north. (United Press dispatch from the 14th)

### Representatives of Four Countries, Britain, the United States, Australia, and Canada, Hold a Meeting on the Far East Situation; The U.S. Approves Treaties to Enhance Friendship

United Press Washington dispatch, 14th: British, American, Australian, and Canadian officials held a meeting on the Far East situation yesterday at the office of Secretary of State Hull. Key figures at the meeting included Duff Cooper, the former British Minister of Information, who is now going to Singapore to take up a new position. The meeting was originally for the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to exchange ratifications of the three treaties concluded to promote peace and friendship among the aforementioned countries. After the completion of the mutual recognition ceremony, they discussed Japan's actions in the Far East and other matters. It is reported that Hull and the Canadian Chargé d'Affaires to the U.S., the New Zealand representative (represented by the British Ambassador Halifax), and the Australian Minister to the U.S. had previously entered into an agreement to establish a committee to handle disputes.

Reuters Washington dispatch, 14th: Former British Minister of Information Duff Cooper, on his way to take office in the Far East, passed through here and met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday. Afterwards, he told people that Britain is prepared to cooperate with the United States on parallel lines around the world. Cooper only said regarding the tense situation in the Far East that Britain feels it cannot allow Japan to act arbitrarily in the Pacific. Cooper also participated in the ceremony when representatives of the four countries, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, formally exchanged the signed texts of treaties to promote peace. This treaty replaces the old treaty of 1914 and stipulates that each country will organize committees to resolve various issues, instead of being handled by a single committee composed of Britain and the United States. This treaty was negotiated last year and is now formally signed.

United Press Washington dispatch, 14th: In response to the question of what influence the Soviet Union has on the Far East situation, Duff Cooper replied, "The Soviet Union has always been helpful in the global situation (the Far East is also a part)."

Reuters Melbourne dispatch, 14th: The Australian War Cabinet discussed various important policy matters with the leaders of the three armed services yesterday and continued to discuss the situation in the Far East. They then reviewed the issue of military pay. Minister for the Army Spender announced that the families of missing soldiers can receive pay for six months after the soldiers go missing. The procedures for implementing the Cabinet's proposal that Australian Prime Minister Menzies should go to London were also extensively discussed. It is expected that the War Cabinet will continue to consider this matter at today's meeting, and a resolution will probably be submitted separately to both houses of Parliament. At present, the general focus of the Labor Party is on the Labor Party conference during the parliamentary session, but the vast majority of the Labor Party is expected to support this resolution.

Central News Agency Batavia dispatch, 14th: Authoritative sources say that the Dutch feel that Japan's occupation of Vietnam is a direct threat to the Dutch East Indies. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to restore normal business relations with Japan. The Japanese announcement that the Dutch-Japanese economic negotiations have reopened is incomprehensible.

### Burma Prepares to Resist Aggression; Sends Personnel to Chongqing to Study Air Defense

Reuters Rangoon dispatch, 14th: With the threat of war closing in on Burma's neighbors, the Burmese are now actively preparing to defend against attacks on Burmese territory. Burmese people generally say that if other countries endanger the lives and happiness of Burma's sixteen million people in their desire to contend for power and profit, then we will defend ourselves to the last person. We are not isolated and helpless. Burma is a country that reveres Buddhism and has religious ties with other countries in the Far East. Having not known war for sixty-three years, it now realizes that if its borders are invaded, then its religion will not be preserved. Those who covet Burma have been broadcasting special propaganda to Burma for months, but the Burmese always scoff at it, because in the eyes of the Burmese, those who violate the law and kill and plunder peaceful countries will be punished by heaven. When Governor of Burma Smith recently inspected various places, the chiefs of the border tribes welcomed him holding British flags and singing war songs, and swore to him that they were willing to die for freedom and promised to implement blackout regulations and accept other restrictions, and to organize guerrilla teams when necessary. The enthusiasm was extremely high. The attitude of the Burmese can be seen from this.

Reuters Rangoon dispatch, 14th: In order to further accelerate the progress of the air defense measures he has adopted, the Burmese Minister of Home Affairs has now decided to send one air defense officer, one medical officer, and one police officer to Chongqing for a week to study the actual bombing situation. The three members are Chief Administrative Officer Captain Tong Laine, Director of Medical Services of the Defense Force Aliason, and Rangoon Police Chief U Tong Aung.

The modern equipment and weapons in the Indian army are all supplied by local Indian arsenals or shipped from overseas." General Wavell said that he was extremely satisfied with the recent inspection of the Northwest and the training of Indian troops. Wavell also said that "any enemy who tries to invade India within the realm of possibility will encounter our fierce obstruction."

### British-Japanese Talks; Contents Kept Secret; The "Tokyo Newspaper" Comments on the Situation, Saying It Has Reached a Serious Stage

United Press Tokyo dispatch, 14th: The British Embassy here refuses to announce the contents of the recent talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda. When asked if the contents were about joint defense of the Dutch East Indies, officials said that this was a "new meeting" for us. The "Zhongwai Business Newspaper" criticized the actions of the United States over the past two weeks in a weekly commentary, saying that before a possible complete severance of relations, an absolute embargo and the withdrawal of consuls are the only possible steps in the future. It also said that the United States had previously been unwilling to make a firm response to Japan's southward advance, but Washington has now decided to take firm action. Therefore, the situation has progressed to a serious stage. The newspaper commented on the domestic situation, saying, "The government must show the people of the country, tell them the country's position and how the people should act. Today, the government has reached a critical period and must not hide the truth from the people for fear of divulging the country's strength to the world. Foreign countries already know Japan's strength, but the Japanese people do not." The "National News" vehemently criticized the ABCD countries for attempting to stop Japan's "co-prosperity" activities, and warned the United States that if the latter takes any further steps against Japan in any form, the relations between the U.S. and Japan will undergo the most severe change. It also said that Britain has been exhausted by two years of war, so it deliberately misinterprets the situation in national defense. It also said, "The New Order in East Asia" should be interpreted as "requiring very little self-defense," so the United States should not be used by Britain to pull chestnuts out of the fire for Britain.

### Unprecedented U.S. War Games Held on the West Coast

Reuters Port Lewis, Washington dispatch, 14th: At dawn yesterday, the West Coast began the largest war games in history. At that time, the Los Angeles Coast Guard remotely saw a fleet coming to invade, and Fort Warden opened fire. After sixteen minutes, the adjudicator ruled that the fort was destroyed. The fleet continued to sail south, and in Seattle, McChord Airfield and half of the defending air force were judged to be destroyed.

### Britain Strengthens Far East Air Force; Warships Escort Ten Thousand Miles; A Large Number of Soldiers Arrive in Singapore

Reuters London dispatch, 14th:

The British Air Ministry's Information Office recently stated that the convoys that have sailed to the Far East in the past few months have all arrived safely after a long journey of ten thousand miles, without the loss of a single person or plane due to enemy action. This is due to the proper protection of warships and aircraft along the way. These convoys carried thousands of soldiers to strengthen the British Air Force in the Far East. The second largest ship, which departed from a port in northern England in the past half month, arrived safely in Singapore a few days ago, without seeing any signs of enemy submarines or aircraft along the way. The voyage was as comfortable as before the war. Those who have now arrived in the Far East have not only replaced the soldiers whose tours of duty have expired, but also provided fresh troops needed for the airfields in Malaya and Burma. Most of them have been transferred from the British bomber and fighter squadrons and have full experience in air combat day and night, so they are of great help to the defense of the Far East.

### Soviet Communiqué Admits Withdrawal from Smolensk; Situation in Southern Ukraine Deteriorates; No Changes in Warfare in Other Areas

TASS Moscow dispatch, 14th: The Soviet Information Bureau issued the war report for August 13th as follows: On the 13th, our army fought the enemy in the Kholm, Staraya Russa, Smolensk, and Velikiye Luki areas. A few days ago, our army withdrew from Smolensk. Our air force continued to strike the enemy. On the 12th, 43 enemy planes were destroyed, and we also lost 35 planes. On the Baltic front, our submarine sank a German oil tanker of 5,000 tons. Also, the Finnish radio station claimed that Soviet planes bombed Dobruja, which the Soviet official has absolutely denied.

Reuters London dispatch, 14th: There have been no major changes in the long Soviet front line, but the Soviets admit that the situation in southern Ukraine has deteriorated. In other areas, fierce fighting is continuing. Neither side has made significant favorable progress. Another place where the Germans claim progress is only north of Lake Peipsi. According to unconfirmed reports, German troops there have reached the Baltic Sea, cutting off Soviet traffic to Tallinn (the capital of Estonia). If this is true, then the German left wing will encounter strong resistance from isolated troops, and the German lines of communication will also be threatened. Tallinn itself is heavily defended, and the Soviet army can use it and Hango Island, across the Gulf of Finland, to completely control the narrow gulf. If Tallinn falls, then the situation of Hango Island will also be greatly threatened. There have been no changes in the war situation around Murmansk in the north or Kiev in the south. Although the German army, which is trying to cut off the ports of Odessa and Nikolaev, is currently advancing, the German side may not shift its main offensive force to this area. It is generally believed that the German army intends to trap the Soviet fresh troops in this area when it resumes its real offensive towards Moscow. It is believed that the number of Soviet troops in this area is not very large, because with the Black Sea under Soviet control, the German eastward advance does not seem to be advancing too far. Currently, the German army is still far from the Dnieper River. If it attacks the river, it will threaten the Don River coal-producing region, which is close to the important Soviet industrial center. It is believed that Odessa must have strong defenses, especially along the coast. The Soviet fleet is strong enough to control the Black Sea. In summary, the threat to Odessa now seems more imminent, but it must be understood that the German goal is not Odessa, but Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev.

### Germany Pressures Bulgaria to Send Troops to Participate in the Attack on the Soviet Union

TASS Bern dispatch, 14th: According to reliable sources, Germany has requested that Bulgaria send two divisions of "reliable" soldiers to the Eastern Front "in the name of volunteers." In Hitler's eyes, this method would allow Bulgaria to participate in the Hitler government's "anti-communist crusade" without having to declare war on the Soviet Union. It is reported that Bulgaria has not yet responded to this request. The Bulgarian authorities explained to Germany that Bulgaria's non-participation in the war could give Germany more food aid, so it is best not to participate. The Bulgarian authorities believe that if Bulgaria participates in the war, it will inevitably lead to internal divisions.

### Germany Plots to Seize Two Black Sea Ports to Seize Large Quantities of Food There

Reuters Moscow dispatch, 14th: Regarding the German claim that the German army is advancing rapidly in Ukraine, the Soviet military responded yesterday that "nothing important happened on the front line on Tuesday." If something very important had happened on the front line, the Soviet side would not have said this, and yesterday's Soviet communique did not mention new place names, indicating that the main German force had not made progress, but this does not mean that the German vanguard would not risk attacking again, because the German army may try to seize the Black Sea port of Nikolaev (70 miles northeast of Odessa) in an attempt to seize large quantities of stored grain there. Currently, Nikolaev has not suffered a serious threat. If it does, then there is every reason to believe that the Soviet side will follow Stalin's policy and transfer the stored grain inland. In any case, the grain has now been harvested. If the Soviet side needs to make a strategic withdrawal, it may abandon a part of the agricultural land in Ukraine and defend the strong positions in the Dnieper River Bay. From an industrial point of view, protecting the Dnieper River is very important.

Reuters London dispatch, 14th: The German and Soviet war reports on the Eastern Front are both silent on the development of the war. The Soviet communiqué said that there was nothing to report, while the Germans still said that the war is proceeding according to plan. Currently, the new war seems to be concentrated in Ukraine. The Berlin communiqué said that the German and Romanian allied forces are now attacking General Patton's troops. German radio said that it has reached the Black Sea coast between Odessa and the Bug River estuary. The latest Soviet communiqué declared that on the evening of August 13, nothing of importance had been reported on any front. The Soviet Air Force cooperated with the army to severely attack enemy mechanized units, infantry, and airfields.

Havas Berlin dispatch, 14th: The official has just issued a communiqué saying that the German army has reached the Black Sea coast between the Soviet port of Odessa and the Bug River estuary.

### The U.S. Will No Longer Recognize the Vichy Pétain Government; If the Axis Powers Invade Africa, Weigand's Resistance; The U.S. Will Implement the Lend-Lease Act to Provide Assistance

United Press Washington dispatch, 14th: Yesterday, the U.S. will provide assistance, but conversely, if General Weygand can separate from the Vichy government and does not cooperate with it, and if the French forces led by General Weygand do not resist when the Axis powers of Europe invade Africa, then the United States will resume recognizing the Vichy government, and will instead recognize the "Free France" led by de Gaulle, and will implement the Lend-Lease Act. He will be recognized as the head of the honorary Free France movement. General Weygand is afraid that he will not give Pétain and Admiral Darlan military cooperation in order to attach himself to the Axis powers, because General Weygand left Vichy and went to Africa when Pétain announced cooperation with Germany. It is also learned that if Weygand immediately surrenders to Germany, the United States will seize Martinique and other French territories in the Americas with other Western Hemisphere countries.

All United Press Washington dispatch, 14th: Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that he is waiting for information from U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy before issuing a statement on future U.S.-French relations, and fully analyzing Vichy's new actions. When asked, Hull refused to discuss this speculation. This question believes that if full cooperation" to the Axis powers in the invasion of French territories in Africa has been established, then the United States is prepared to take appropriate action. In answering questions from the press about rumors that the United States is considering seizing Martinique Island, Hull said that Washington has no information on this issue other than the German rumors.

Havas dispatch, 13th, Washington: After French Head of State Pétain gave a broadcast speech yesterday, most members of both houses of Congress here advocated severing diplomatic relations with France. The American newspapers also did not like Pétain's speech, and strongly stated that if the naval bases on the coast of French West Africa were allowed to be used by Germany, it would pose a serious danger to the United States. However, the official side remained silent on this and refused to comment, only saying that the government authorities would have to reopen negotiations with the French government on the issue of French Martinique Island and French territories in the Western Hemisphere in order to obtain assurances that they would not be used by forces hostile to the United States.

Pétain Establishes Political Tribunal Havas dispatch, 13th, Vichy: According to well-informed sources here, Head of State Pétain announced yesterday when he broadcast that he would establish a political tribunal, but this does not mean that the Lyon Supreme Court will stop trying those responsible for the "disaster of the country," because its purpose is to enable Head of State Pétain to quickly convict all political criminals in the future. Even before the formal verdict, the Head of State has the power to punish them, because the Head of State is the supreme judge. According to the establishment of the Lyon Supreme Court a year ago, it was set up to try various ministers who had been derelict in their duties. Former Prime Minister Daladier, former Commander-in-Chief of National Defense Gamelin, former Prime Minister Blum, former Minister of the Interior Mantel, and former Minister of Aviation Cote are all among those accused, and are still in prison. In short, the political tribunal decided to be established this time is roughly a consultative body, and does not conflict with the Lyon Supreme Court. It is heard that the person in charge will prepare his opinion letter on October 15 and submit it to Head of State Pétain for review.

### Darlan Issues Letter to the Officers and Soldiers

Havas dispatch, 14th, Vichy: After Darlan took over as Deputy Chief of State and Minister of National Defense, he recently issued a letter to the officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, saying that he was honored to be entrusted with this important task by the Head of State, and would do his best to perform his duties with impartiality and treat all officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force equally, regardless of rank. Head of State Pétain has dedicated himself to the country, and with his great wisdom and courage, he has opened up a path for us. I will naturally follow this path, and all my comrades must take the four words of glory, motherland, discipline, and character as the norm.

International News Service Washington dispatch, 14th: Secretary of State Hull yesterday denied that Washington was about to take action on Martinique Island. Germany claimed that as a result of Vichy's cooperation with the Axis powers, the U.S. was prepared to seize the French West Indies. Hull commented on the news, saying that the German rumors are the only basis for the news. (Authoritative sources in Berlin claimed last night that the U.S. will seize Martinique Island on the grounds that French-German cooperation will threaten the Western Hemisphere. The same source strongly stated that France and the Axis powers will strongly denounce British and American joint intervention in European affairs. German-French peaceful cooperation can harm the United States, which is generally considered "laughable." At the same time, well-informed sources said that Washington is now considering severing commercial relations with French North Africa. According to the U.S.-French agreement, the U.S. can transport various necessities, including oil, to French territories, but once the commercial agreement is cancelled, U.S. relations with France will be on the verge of collapse.

### Japan Implements Mobilization Law; Prices Greatly Affected; Stocks and Shipping are Under Control; Similar Orders in North China

United Press Tokyo dispatch, 14th: Since the National Mobilization Commission implemented four articles of the Imperial Mobilization Law, Japan today has officially entered the wartime foundation. The four bills are about controlling the stock market, various shipping, the government's official pricing of corporate bonds and prices, and controlling prices regulations, which will replace the price regulation regulations of last September. There are 7,000 kinds of goods affected by it. The move to control stock prices is to avoid the collapse of market prices in order to facilitate the slight call of capital for the expansion of factories. The detailed rules for controlling prices have not been announced, but this regulation is to prevent poor distribution and hoarding. As for the regulations on controlling shipping, they enable government agencies to have direct and complete guidance on domestic commercial shipping. This new shipping management includes regulations on all shipping-related charges. The "Manchukuo" also has a mobilization bill similar to that of Japan. Often, after the first step is implemented in Tokyo, "Manchukuo" will follow suit. North China also has similar economic orders to cooperate with Japan in establishing a "Co-Prosperity Sphere."

### British Planes Bomb Italy Fiercely; Chemical Plant

Reuters Cairo dispatch, 14th: Since the British Air Force has stepped up its attacks on Germany and northern France, its scope of activities has been expanding day by day. On Sunday, it even flew to southern Italy and fiercely bombed a chemical plant in Jing Luotoni. According to a communiqué issued by the British Air Force Command in the Middle East here, when British planes attacked this area in southern Italy, they dropped many bombs, hitting the storage depot and severely damaging it. The entire target caught fire and the flames soared into the sky. Other British planes destroyed military buildings in Caliati. Several targets in the western Sineka area were also bombed by the British Air Force on Sunday night. After British planes bombed Gatzella Airfield, the results could not be clearly seen due to low clouds. Military buildings attacked in Badia caught fire, and the levee in Duna was also bombed and damaged. Also, on Sunday night, enemy planes flew over Malta and dropped bombs, causing minor material damage. British fighter planes intercepted them and shot down two enemy planes. On the same night, British bombers made a long-distance attack on the port of Tripoli, destroying buildings in the port and starting a fire near the power plant. British planes also fiercely strafed enemy motor vehicles on the nearby coastal highway. One British plane was lost in the above battles.

### Turkish Cabinet: Rumors of Reorganization, British Ambassador Hosts Turkish Foreign Minister

Hava Khan, 14th – A dispatch from the Turkish capital:

Rumors of a cabinet reshuffle have been rife recently. It is said that the current Prime Minister, Seydan Ruogu, will resign, and Foreign Minister Samsala Zhuoge Lu will succeed him in forming a cabinet. As for the selection of the new foreign minister, it will likely be either the ambassador to Germany, Jie Laide, or the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Meinai Gezhuo Lu.

Reuters, 14th – A dispatch from the Turkish capital: British Ambassador Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen hosted Turkish Foreign Minister Samsala Zhuoge Lu and four Turkish cabinet members last night.

Reuters, 14th – A dispatch from the Turkish capital: The British Ambassador recently delivered a letter to the Foreign Minister, stating that the British and Soviet declaration to Turkey has in no way altered the 1939 treaty, nor has it expanded the limits and obligations of this treaty. The meaning of the declaration is merely to reiterate the obligations to Turkey contained in the first clause of the treaty signed in October 1939.

### Germany Building Defense Works in Norway

United Press, 10th – A dispatch from London: A senior Norwegian source told the United Press today that, according to reliable information received in London, German troops are actively building fortifications in Norway, and a large number of workers have been sent from Denmark and Germany. German troops are now stepping up their control over Norway. They anticipate that British or Allied forces may attack the German forces via the North Sea because a new front has been established on the Soviet-Finnish border. The accelerated construction of airfields and coastal defenses in Norway has been particularly noticeable in the past two weeks.

### US President Approves Establishment of Special Protection Force to Prevent Espionage

Reuters, 14th – A dispatch from Washington:

President Roosevelt has approved a plan to establish a special protection force to defend naval facilities and prevent sabotage and espionage.

### Reminiscences of a Visit with Indian Poet Laureate Tagore (I)

— Xu Baoqian

The eighty-year-old Indian poet laureate Rabindranath Tagore passed away in Calcutta on the 17th of this month. The loss of this "wooden-tongued bell" of Eastern civilization is truly as stated in Chairman Chiang's condolence message. Two years ago, I had the opportunity to attend the World Christian Conference in India, and I was able to visit contemporary Indian celebrities such as Gandhi, Tagore, and Nehru. I was honored to be hosted by Tagore and stayed for two days at the International University he founded, where I had the opportunity to witness Tagore's demeanor, listen to his words, and visit the educational and rural improvement projects he held. I have always felt fortunate. Now, at the request of friends at the Shen Bao, I am writing a series of articles to introduce aspects of Tagore's life, writings, thoughts, and career.

The Initiation of the Visiting Group

The World Christian Conference was held in Madura, India, at the end of November of the 27th year of the Republic. Some of the Chinese representatives invited Ms. Lester, a British friend familiar with the situation in India and who had visited China several times, to initiate an international visiting group. More than ten people joined at that time, representing the nationalities of Britain, America, China, Japan, Canada, and South Africa (blacks). Mr. Kagawa Toyohiko, a prominent Japanese Christian, originally intended to join, but stopped due to matters, and changed to Murao. We left Madura and headed north on the morning of the 30th, and arrived in Wardha the next morning. After several miles, we reached Mahatma Gandhi's residence, named Swgaon. We left Wardha on the morning of January 28th, and arrived in Calcutta on the morning of the 4th. We arrived at Santiniketan (meaning "Abode of Peace") on the 7th, which is Tagore's residence and the location of the International University.

The Process of Visiting Tagore

The first impression of the International University run by Tagore was that it did not look like the site of an ordinary university, but a large forest. Ancient trees stood tall, and the environment was quiet. Only when we saw the buildings scattered everywhere and the groups of male and female students did we suddenly realize that this was a forest academy.

Tagore treated us with special courtesy. We lived in Western-style houses and ate Western food. This was very different from the way Gandhi entertained guests.

At 1:45 p.m. on the 7th, Tagore made an exception (it is said that Tagore's usual talk time is often at 5 p.m.) to give us a quarter of an hour of conversation. At that time, Tagore was already seventy-eight years old. Although his waist was slightly bent, his eyes were piercing, his spirit was high, his white hair hung down, his silver beard was long, he wore a silk robe, and his nose was high. We could not help but think of the demeanor of the Russian literary giant Tolstoy in the photographs. Our group sat around Tagore, asking him many questions about various aspects in a quarter of an hour. As far as I can remember, most of them focused on Tagore's attitude towards the national movement, his international thoughts, and the educational and rural work he had done himself.

Tagore frankly told us that he expressed deep sympathy for the national movement. He admired Gandhi's personality and ability to lead the masses. He also admired Nehru and regarded him as a "rising star." However, he said: He was already old, and he was a poet after all, so he could not contribute much to this great national liberation movement, which made him feel sorry.

Tagore also told us: Unfortunately, he was accused of the "bad name" of a poet, so people always thought that he did not pay attention to the practical problems of life. In fact, the education he ran was completely integrated with life. Moreover, the rural work he did was still pioneering, because at that time, the national movement led by Gandhi had not yet started to reform the rural areas.

Tagore also said: In his literary works, he advocated the liberation of the oppressed classes and started decades ago. The dance drama we can see tonight is a work from Tagore's middle age. Tagore adapted this script based on the story of Ananda being tempted by a demon girl in the Buddhist scriptures. He placed the demon girl in several classes. Finally, she and Ananda were bathed in the Buddha's light and gained salvation. In this way, it demonstrates Tagore's idea of liberating civilians.

Tagore advocated the harmony of Eastern and Western cultures and advocated international peace. He tried his best to oppose all aggressive wars. He deeply admired the inherent advantages of Japanese culture. However, he was deeply dissatisfied with Japan's recent trend towards militarism. When the August 13th Incident occurred, tens of thousands of innocent Chinese people were bombed, which aroused dissatisfaction among the public opinion of India. Noguchi Ujo, a famous Japanese poet, knew Tagore. Driven by patriotism, he wrote to Tagore in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic to defend the government's actions in invading China. This caused Tagore's dissatisfaction. Noguchi was greatly disappointed by Tagore's reply, which was straightforward, and wrote to Tagore again in August. After receiving the letter, Tagore was very disappointed in Noguchi and severely rebuked him in his reply. Tagore printed the four letters in which he and Noguchi debated and distributed one copy to each of us. After reading it, I asked Murao, a Japanese who was traveling with me. According to the answer, it must have been written by someone else for Tagore, and the wording can be said to be skillful.

Visiting Tagore's Career

At 3:30 p.m. on the 7th, we were invited to attend Tagore's grand social gathering to entertain an Indian prince. It is said that the prince's father was a close friend of Tagore and had donated a lot of money to the cause run by Tagore. At the meeting, we met three Chinese students: one named Wang Junjing (Ms.), who came to study nearby because she lived in Myanmar; one named Shi Xiulu (from Jiangsu); and one named Shi Fazhou, both of whom had been ordained as monks and had lived in Ceylon for a year. We met in a foreign land, and naturally had another kind of emotion. After the meeting, we visited the International University campus and internal facilities (see details below). From 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on the 7th, the male and female students of the International University performed Tagore's song and dance drama for a certain prince. The name of the drama is Chadra, and the content describes the story of Ananda being tempted by a demon girl and being rescued by the supernatural power of the Tathagata Buddha. (To be continued)

### The United States Has Completed Necessary Preparations and Has Determination in the Far East; Major Changes Are Expected in the Spring of Next Year; The Foundation for World Peace Has Now Been Laid

According to a special dispatch from Washington published in the Continental Daily News yesterday, the United States has fully prepared its naval and air forces and is determined to curb Japan's new adventures in the Far East. Therefore, the relationship between the two countries is on the verge of erupting. If the Soviet Union can resist the German army until the winter of the year, and China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands work together to defeat Japan in the spring of next year, then Britain will be able to transfer its forces in the Far East to Europe to eliminate Hitler's forces. Then, at the end of 1942, there is hope for the realization of world peace. Secretary of State Hull's statement on the 12th almost explained the ultimate goal of the United States.

The Continental Daily News published a special telegram from Washington on the 13th yesterday, saying that the relationship between the United States and Japan today has reached the point of eruption. According to well-informed sources, the United States seems to have decided early on to fully prepare its naval and air forces to curb Japan's new expansion in the Far East. Today, the United Kingdom and the United States are completely consistent in policy and action. If Japan advances militarily to the south or north, Japan will inevitably encounter armed sanctions.

The United States Arranges for Both Offense and Defense

According to qualified observers of the Far East problem here, in the past two years, the US policy has been quite disappointing to most Chinese people. However, this policy has allowed the United States to calmly arrange military affairs and allow Britain to gain a more solid position in the skies of Western Europe, so as to prevent the Axis powers from winning victories in various parts of the world. Two years ago, the United States was completely unprepared. The actions of Congress were very slow, and the attitude of the public was indifferent. Any drastic measures were inappropriate at that time. Two years ago, Singapore and Myanmar were not prepared, and the Atlantic base that President Roosevelt exchanged for the US destroyer also lacked facilities for both offensive and defensive purposes. If the United States and Japan were at war at that time, the small number of American aircraft that Britain could obtain would be intercepted, which would be enough to contribute to Britain's failure and enable Japan to win a possible victory. However, today's situation is very different. Because Germany's war against the Soviet Union has consumed a large amount of manpower and machinery, it is believed that if Hitler can be contained until this winter, the democratic countries will surely win.

Division of Labor and Cooperation to Resist Aggression

The observer told reporters that if Germany is frustrated, the "grand strategy" of the global war will be to attack Japan, and China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands will cooperate to defeat Japan in the coming spring. If this strategy can be completed, Hitler's situation will be hopeless. Japan's threat has been removed, and the situation in the Pacific can be stabilized. Then, China will receive aircraft supplies from the Philippines, Hawaii, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. At this time, China's responsibility is to sweep away the Japanese troops trapped in mainland China. Under these circumstances, the entire military force of the United Kingdom in Singapore, the Dutch-Indian military force, and the US Far East Fleet can be transferred to the Atlantic to destroy Hitler's positions in Europe. The observer firmly believes that Soviet Russia will be able to contain the German army until this winter, and before the coming spring, it will be able to weaken Japan's strength and its threat. If these major aspects can be realized, the end of 1942 will come with peace.

Hull's Statement is Firm

Although the Congress and the American people have no explanation, the enthusiastic support for the war against Japan far exceeds the support for participating in a purely European war. Most Americans still believe that the European war is a purely European affair, so they do not pay much attention to Hitler's Western Hemisphere plan. However, the general American people, who understand Japan, are deeply convinced that Japan is not an ideal ally. Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull's statement on the purpose and policy of the United States was not used as a bait for Japan or other countries, but was a final summary of the US policy on its own purpose. This policy has always been based on maintaining peace in a rational and appropriate way. Approaching the point of entering the war, this statement is almost a clear statement of the US goal.

### Former Site of British Intelligence Agency Prepared to Be Relocated

Yesterday, the Japanese owner of Greenland Building, No. 2 Beijing Road, notified the British Intelligence Agency in the building to relocate. According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the British Intelligence Agency recently stated that although the Japanese owner has not ordered them to move out, they have been notified to relocate when the lease expires. Therefore, the British Intelligence Agency is now making preparations for this.

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that Shanghai has been rumored that the Cathay Land Company has sold Hamilton House to a certain Sino-Japanese business, and that the sale of Riverside Apartments is also being negotiated. A certain member of the Cathay Land Company firmly denied this.

### Charity Organizations Hold Emergency Relief in the Nanshi Area; Blockade Status Not Removed; Relief Area Expanded

The famine in Nanshi is full of cries. All charity organizations are deeply concerned. The Zhongjiao Daoyi Association on Tongfu Road in this city has organized a relief group and promoted emergency relief for the poor people in Nanshi. It has been distributing relief supplies continuously for days. On the former memorial day of the Shanghai War, it also sent vehicles to distribute relief items such as wheat cakes, steamed buns, and wheat flour as usual. The scope of relief has now been extended to Tangjiawan, Chenghuang Temple, Haichao Temple Road, Xietu Road, Longhua Road, Gaochang Temple, and other places. It is reported that the association's emergency relief will continue until the blockade status is completely eliminated, so as to benefit the general poor.

### Banks Are Ordered to Balance Unsettled Foreign Exchange Today; Taylor Will Propose Measures to Manage the Foreign Exchange Market; There Is No Specific Method for Applying for Foreign Exchange

Since the freezing orders of the United Kingdom and the United States were implemented, there have been many unclear points and difficulties in the implementation of Chinese and foreign banks. Mr. Taylor, an assistant to the Stabilization Commission, came to Shanghai to provide instructions and investigations. After arriving in Shanghai, Taylor has already made preliminary contact with foreign banks such as Citibank on the 13th, but as of yesterday, no contact with the Chinese banking community has been heard. It is said that Taylor will return to Hong Kong and make a suggestion to the Stabilization Fund based on the results of the investigation in Shanghai, in accordance with the government's determination to stabilize the Shanghai foreign exchange market and effectively manage and prevent the Japanese from taking advantage of the principle. It is rumored that there is a saying that the US exchange rate will be maintained at 5 yuan and the British exchange rate will be 3 pence.

Chinese Banks Will Have Suggestions

It is heard that Chinese banks will also submit a suggestion to the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, requesting instructions on whether Chinese legitimate merchants need to go through application procedures when applying for foreign exchange. The Chinese financial authorities have not yet promulgated specific methods for this point, resulting in no way to follow. According to the current expedient method, all legitimate merchants applying for foreign exchange from Chinese and foreign banks must (1) have dealings with the bank, and (2) submit documents to prove that they are indeed a legitimate need. The simplicity of the method has many drawbacks, because the Japanese can use the Shanghai free trade port as a medium to transship and absorb foreign materials from Shanghai.

Deadline to Balance Foreign Exchange Today

The Bank of China will notify Chinese banks operating foreign exchange that checks and mortgage bills issued before July 26 may still be handled for receipt and payment with the US banks' accounts in accordance with the provisions of General Note No. 55. If they wish to transfer funds, the Central Bank may handle them on their behalf in accordance with the provisions of General Note No. 60. It is now learned that the Central Bank has ordered all banks to balance the above-mentioned unreceived foreign exchange by the deadline today and handle the receipt and payment on their behalf. The purpose of this method is to enable these banks to avoid business difficulties due to the freezing of funds. Taking August as an example, Chinese banks have experienced short selling of foreign exchange. Because this move contains speculative nature, the Central Bank has strictly ordered Chinese banks with such circumstances to make up for the short sales immediately and balance them all by today. Yesterday's report that the Central Bank will announce measures to manage the black market foreign exchange is a misunderstanding of the deadline for balancing foreign exchange trading. The Central Bank, fearing that the rumors were untrue and would have a profound impact, officially and firmly denied it yesterday.

Black Market Foreign Exchange is Rampant and Planning for Remediation

After the order to freeze funds was issued, most people in the local market believed that the black market for foreign exchange would disappear invisibly, or at least not undergo the drastic changes of the past. Unexpectedly, the black market foreign exchange trade is still free, just as before. In fact, the control of foreign exchange has been transferred to the hands of fourteen foreign firms. In recent days, many companies have settled their accounts, and speculators have secretly absorbed them in the name of import foreign firms. As a result, foreign banks took the opportunity to raise prices and were unwilling to provide much. Although there were selling prices, they often could not be obtained in full when they were asked to settle. As a result, demand exceeded supply, and the exchange rate tightened. HSBC's listing has shrunk for three consecutive days, and the black market for the US exchange rate has broken through the 5 yuan mark, and the British exchange rate is unprecedentedly tight, and it is impossible to stabilize the black market.

### Business Corps Chinese Team Assists in Guarding

This year's fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War, the authorities are more strict in preparing and defending than in previous years. In addition to the full mobilization of police and arresters, members of the International Business Corps also participated in assisting in the defense. The Chinese team and the translation team members were also ordered to form 26 car patrol teams, which took armed vehicles from 5:00 a.m. on the 9th to 8:00 a.m. yesterday, taking turns patrolling the main roads in the central district day and night. Therefore, during the standby period, the order within the boundary was safe and no accidents occurred. As for the remaining members of the two teams, they were also armed and waiting for orders during the standby period, ready to be dispatched at any time. This time, all the Chinese members of the Business Corps enthusiastically participated despite the hot weather, and a small number of team members went out to defend despite their illnesses. Their spirit of enthusiastically serving the local area is deeply admirable and is a great honor for our Chinese people. From today, the two concessions will resume ordinary standby.

### Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Conducts Survey of Living Expenses of Salaried Class; Seeks 500 Chinese Household Budgeting Families

Recently, prices have risen day by day, which has had a great impact on the living expenses of the salaried class. The current cost of living index of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council was originally compiled for workers and Westerners and is not applicable to the Chinese salaried class.

Each family will record detailed income and expenditure accounts for three months from October 1, 30th year of the Republic. The department has printed special account books, which are sent to each account-keeping family every month. Each family is assigned a number. The account book cover does not contain the name, only the number. After analysis, the index is published, and there is no other intention or any cost.

Three Standards for Budgeting Families

(2) The salary and other income of the head of the family, regardless of the amount, is limited to an average of no more than 1,000 legal currency per month. The distribution of households should account for 7 out of 10 below 500 yuan, and 3 out of 10 between 500 and 1,000 yuan. Those whose salary is in foreign currency are not eligible. (3) The family population should be at least two people, husband and wife, together with children and dependents, up to 10 people. Lodgers and servants are excluded.

Attention to All Schools

To be cautious, the checks issued by this newspaper to applicant students, bearing the school's name, will have the phrase "or bearer" crossed out to prevent abuse. Students can then submit these checks to their paying bank or school. This method poses no problem for schools with bank accounts, but may present difficulties for those without. Therefore, we have requested the issuing bank to honor the checks when presented by the bearer, with the school's seal and responsible person's endorsement. We kindly ask schools to accept these checks when students submit them for tuition payments and not refuse them, appreciating the students' difficulties and the need for strict scholarship disbursement procedures.

High School and University Group

The High School and University Scholarship Committee will convene on the 19th of this month for the final review. The list of approved recipients is scheduled to be announced on the 10th. Please pay attention. If there are any changes to the "Intended School" listed on the application form, please notify this newspaper with a letter and attach the admission notice immediately. If school exam results are not released before the 19th, please inform this newspaper. Otherwise, checks bearing the name of a school different from the one the student attends will not be cashed. We hope for your attention and cooperation.

The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund Committee held its second meeting on the afternoon of the 13th. In addition to the five committee members – Shen Siliang, Chen Qingshi, Nie Lingyu, Lu Gaoyi, and Zhao Zongyu – staff from other groups were also present. The committee reviewed the elementary school applicants one by one, taking two hours to approve eighty names (list above). Regarding the case of the seven orphans from the Youyou Child Care Center who were admitted to Suzhou Middle School, and the request from the center for subsidies for the students' room and board in addition to tuition, the committee decided to only approve tuition assistance as per regulations, and found it difficult to approve room and board subsidies.

### Abandoned for Ten Years; Pouring Out Endless Hidden Pain: Visit to Scholarship Applicant, No. 8

Miss L. is nineteen years old this year, and plans to enter the English Department of a certain church university after the summer vacation. Her sister, twelve years old, has been admitted to a certain church girls' school. They both applied for scholarships at the same time. In Miss L.'s resume section, it was filled in: "Father abandoned the family and did not care for it when the applicant was eight years old because he had an affair, and it has been more than ten years since then." When I saw this application form, it aroused keen attention, so I visited her the day after receiving the documents.

I took the No. 22 bus to the intersection of Fulu Road and Qiqi Road, walked not far west, and found their address. After knocking on the copper ring on the shikumen for a few times, a young woman opened the door.

"Is there a Miss L. here?" I asked the young woman. At the same time, I glanced at the living room, which was very clean.

"Where are you from? What's the matter?" the young woman asked me politely.

"I am from the newspaper for the scholarship matter. I want to visit two Miss Ls. Do they live here?"

"Yes, there are Miss Ls here. They live in the pavilion room on the third floor."

"Can I go in from here?" Because the living room was a room, I dared not rush in. After receiving her permission, she led me through the living room and walked up the escalator. I turned around and said thank you to her.

Walking up to the pavilion room on the third floor, a lady in her fifties was already welcoming me at the door. I walked into the pavilion room, and the lady invited me to sit on a square stool and poured me a cup of boiled water. She sat on the bed opposite me. The furnishings in the room were very simple, but very clean. I already knew that this family was quite noble.

"Two ladies applied for scholarships to our newspaper, and I am here to visit today. Have the two ladies gone out? Is this Mrs. L.?"

"I don't dare, yes. It's really unfortunate, they both have something to go out. "Mrs. L. answered my questions in a calm tone.

"Miss L. took the ×× University exam. I think she must have been admitted? Looking at the results, her studies are very good."

"The exam period has not arrived yet. They are still diligent. When the eldest one was studying in middle school, she also worked as a tutor to supplement her pocket money because the economy was too difficult."

"How many sisters and brothers does Miss L. have? What does Mr. L. do? Where is he now?"

Mrs. L. sighed after hearing my words.

"Our family should be able to help others as much as possible. Who would have thought that we are now living such a difficult life, and the children have to ask others for help to study!" Mrs. L. said in a sad tone, telling her experience and family situation. "The children's father is a legislator in the government. He abandoned us ten years ago! At first, I sued him in court. After several hearings, the case was not closed. Later, he ran away to another place, and the lawsuit was shelved. Since then, he has abandoned the entire family and does not care about the children!"

"The eldest son is twenty-six years old this year. He is married and is now working at the Qinhuangdao Customs. Now we rely entirely on him to send 100 yuan a month to support us. The second daughter is twenty-four years old and is idle at home. The third daughter is twenty-two years old and works as a family teacher. The fourth daughter is nineteen years old. She just graduated from middle school and wants to go to university, so she applied to your newspaper, because I am illiterate myself, of course I hope my children can study well, but now there is no strength? The fifth son is seventeen years old and went to the rear to join the army last year. I heard that he is now in some military academy. The sixth daughter, twelve years old, just graduated from elementary school and has been admitted to ×× Girls' School. They are all very good, but the younger daughter is going to middle school in the second half of the year. The journey is very long and it is very inconvenient to go back and forth, and the expenses are also very high: she cannot read and teach like her sister to earn some pocket money."

Family disputes and personal trauma are usually not easily confided to others. But for the sake of a scholarship application visit, I didn't want to, and shouldn't have, inquired into everything in the past, but only asked about the current economic life situation. Unexpectedly, this aroused the inner trauma of the parents of the applicants, and they confided to us, without any concealment, the course of their life's misery. This is something we are very sorry for and should give unlimited sympathy.

I highly doubt that a national legislator cannot "establish" his own "law".

"Mrs. L., your children are very ambitious, you are still a blessed person!" I comforted her sympathetically when I left. (T)

### Welfare Bakery Fire; Four Killed and Injured; Apprentice Jumps Out Window and Dies in Flames; Three Injured Severely Climbing Through Skylight

Around 2:25 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at Welfare Bakery Company, established by Shandong native Yang Guanlin at Nos. 483-491 Rue du Consulat. The fire spread rapidly and could not be contained, resulting in a total of four deaths and injuries. The fire was extinguished around 4:00 PM, causing severe losses. Welfare Bakery Company, which also manufactures candies and biscuits, has been in operation for many years and has a thriving business, having opened three branches on Avenue Joffre.

Oil Pan Explodes

Around 2:25 PM yesterday afternoon, while the company was busy at work, the diesel oven pipe on the upper floor of the workshop at No. 485 suddenly ruptured with a loud noise, causing diesel to spill and catch fire. The fire quickly spread to Nos. 487 and 483. Within five minutes, five rooms on the floor were engulfed in flames. Seeing this situation, the workers scattered to find exits. However, the floor had only one staircase leading to the retail department at No. 493, and all the windows were covered with wire mesh, making it impossible to jump down. Zhang Wenjie (32 years old), Tong Zhiding (24 years old), and Xu Yaoxing (around 30 years old) climbed through the skylight and jumped from the roof. They were all covered in flames. Zhang was the most severely injured, with burns to his head, chest, hands, and feet. Xu Yaoxing suffered burns to his hands and feet, and his head was fractured from the fall. Tong Zhiding was the least injured. All three were taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

Apprentice Burned to Death

An apprentice, only 15 years old, panicked at the sight of the fire. Unaware that the windows were nailed with wire mesh, he tried to climb out of the window. However, the fire had already reached him, and he perished in the flames. When the fire broke out, the fire department was immediately notified and dispatched fire engines to the scene. However, since oil is lighter than water, the burning oil floated on the water surface. Therefore, despite efforts to spray water, the fire only intensified. The fire was gradually extinguished using chemical foam. After investigation, it was found that five large rooms were destroyed. The company had reportedly insured for 150,000 yuan with an insurance company. The person in charge of the company stated that this was the previous insurance policy, and with the current high prices, the losses would exceed 150,000 yuan.

### Ding's Ointment Sells Well

Recently, the weather has been humid and sultry, and various surgical conditions such as redness, swelling, pain, dampness, and heat boils have become prevalent. As a result, the sales of Ding's Ointment produced by China No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory have increased, surpassing imported products. It is said that this ointment can eliminate the shape and traces of early-stage heat boils in two hours. If the swelling has already subsided, it can also drain pus and close the wound. When used for dampness, it can immediately draw out large amounts of moisture and toxins, clear internal toxins, and often heal the affected area quickly.

### Yarn; Bulls Rush into the Future Yarn Market; Spot Yarn Prices Rise Steadily

The yarn market has turned upward again. This is because the consolidation for several days has triggered bullish activity, resulting in a particularly strong rebound. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants have a strong demand for 32-count single yarn, and prices are rising. As a result, market sentiment is good. In addition, the yarn and cloth market conditions on the exchange are rising steadily, further intensifying the speculative mood of general traders and triggering a buying spree, pushing the market forward. However, transactions of 20-count yarn by Hong Kong merchants remain weak. The deficit of those with sufficient capital is not being offset. General speculators, given the tense situation, are starting to switch from short to long positions. Therefore, the price has broken through the 160 yuan mark. The upward momentum is strong. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 1,641 yuan, and the low price is 1,624 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 1,633 yuan. Due to the high prices on the exchange and strong market sentiment, the buying momentum intensified, rising directly to 1,655 yuan. The final price was 1,652 yuan. Regarding the current situation of the yarn market, some say that if the price rises by several tens of yuan, they will sell, while others will buy, which is a purely speculative effect.

The morning opening of Double Horse was enthusiastic because the exchange price had already risen on the previous day, and the bulls followed. The opening price was 1,630 yuan, and it soon fell to 1,624 yuan. However, it was heard that the price of Blue Phoenix yarn was not loosening, and buyers increased their bids. Under this environment, those who were short had no power to resist and scrambled to cover their positions, pushing the price back up to 1,641 yuan. However, those who were making profits sold, causing the price to loosen again to 1,632 yuan. The closing price was 1,636 yuan. It was found that the total volume of transactions during the half-day was 7,700 bales. The amounts purchased by each trading group are listed below: Hong Kong, 200 bales; Traders, 7,500 bales; Total, 7,700 bales.

The future market for Gold Double Horse yarn continued the momentum of the previous day and advanced sharply again. At the initial opening, although the spot yarn price rose sharply by more than 20 yuan due to the lack of market on the previous day, the future yarn price hovered. The opening price for the August contract was 1,475 yuan, slightly down by 3 yuan. The September contract was 1,554 yuan, also down by 3 yuan. The October contract was 1,568.5 yuan, slightly down by 1.5 yuan. Later, as the gold market rose sharply and the exchange also rose, market sentiment became excited. Bulls came one after another, and the market price rose steadily under the cover of buying sentiment. However, as floating longs and retail investors sold from time to time, the noon closing price for the August contract was 1,478 yuan, the September contract was 1,561 yuan, and the October contract was 1,578.5 yuan, which were still mixed. 9,220 bales were traded, During the afternon session, the market situation became increasingly strong, and positive news spread frequently. In addition, the spot yarn foundation was solid, which further aroused the trust of buyers. Therefore, demand exceeded supply on the trading floor, and prices rose sharply. Especially near the close, due to the gold market being outside the market by nearly 200 yuan, the three-lot October contract once broke out of the 1,600 yuan range. As a result, the August contract was 1,489 yuan, an increase of 11 yuan at the close; the September contract was 1,579 yuan, a high increase of 22 yuan; and the October contract was 1,596 yuan, a sharp increase of 26.5 yuan. The difference between the near and far terms was 107 yuan. The total volume traded during the day was 16,440 bales, an increase of 6,940 bales compared to the previous day. Observing the strong foundation of the yarn market, there is no lack of bulls pushing up the price and other factors. With the addition of short selling from retail investors, there is a chance for further increases. The table of market prices during the day is listed below.

### U.S. Cotton Loan Passed, Fine Cotton Inevitably to Rise, New York Buying, Industry Speculation, and Short Covering All Present, Shanghai Transactions of Fine Cotton Not as Numerous as Coarse Cotton

The local cotton market situation is even more enthusiastic, transactions are active, prices are firm, 42s and 32s raw materials inevitably rise, but fine cotton is too expensive after all, there is not much spot, and less trading, although the demand for coarse cotton is not strong, the transaction of the traders is prosperous, so the transaction of foreign cotton is enthusiastically expanded due to the excitement of the people, American cotton, Mitelin and high-grade Brazilian cotton are all up five or six yuan from the previous day, because all parties have a good buying intention, and American and Indian cotton have risen again, the general intention of the traders and hoarders is to collect the spot, and continue to work hard, at the same time, a few factories are also ordering large batches of Brazilian cotton arriving in Shanghai in September and October to compete, yesterday Jardine Matheson's ship "Yusheng" arrived in Shanghai in the morning, transporting 4,500 bales of cotton from Calcutta, India, stored in the Roosevelt Warehouse, after this arrival continues, the yarn factory's raw materials, even if the situation changes, will not be in danger of shortage, but people think that this cotton has been plundered, and they have to seek foreign cotton, resulting in this phenomenon, yesterday's cotton transactions are as follows,

The Indian cotton market first rose due to buying by European exporters, and then fell due to selling by retail investors, but then rose again due to short covering and speculative buying, yesterday's closing prices each rose two to six rupees, and it is predicted that the opening market today will rise by five rupees due to the sharp rise in American cotton,

### Japanese Merchants Prefer to Settle Foreign Exchange Inward, Making Large New Transactions

### Confessions of a Weakling: My Hopes for Scholarship Applicants

— Xintang

A Sound Mind is Essential, and a Strong Body is Absolutely Necessary

I have been out of middle school for six years, and I still have a strong desire to study, but I am a disabled person, a lung disease sufferer. I am very envious of you scholarship applicants, who have received the enthusiastic appeals of zealous reporters and the support of society's most kind people from impossible circumstances, allowing you to continue to advance. I rejoice in your future, but the other day, when I saw in a "visiting record" a scholarship applicant with a thin physique, I couldn't help but remember my tragedy, which is a good reference for applicants. My family is also very poor, living entirely off of five acres of land. I am a little luckier than you, in that I have good relatives who often support me, allowing me to enter middle school. Later, I received help from a cousin uncle, finally getting into high school. In the two years leading up to graduation, I prepared to enter the Central Political School, where there are no costs. So I studied hard day and night, never going to bed before twelve o'clock every night. When I was tired, I desperately drank black tea, which was quite effective, so there was not a single word in chemistry or physics that I did not read thoroughly. But after supporting myself like this for two months, my body finally changed. It was inevitable that I would become thinner, my chest felt sore from time to time, and I also suffered from insomnia. My innate constitution was not very good, so in the third month, I contracted the frightening symptom of spitting blood. I spat out large mouthfuls, each time filling a spittoon, and from then on, I gradually became unable to get up and stopped going to school. At that time, my uncle called me to his house, where I helped with some paperwork, and I was fortunate enough not to be forced by life, barely surviving until now, but this fate is tragic.

Diligence in reading is important, but physical fitness is equally important. I have seen many classmates who studied diligently for many years and later developed lung disease, disappointing and regrettable everyone.

Scholarship applicants, I think you are all excellent talents, but quickly pay attention to your physical fitness, and do not be like me in blindly reading and destroying yourself. It is very helpful to take notes when reading each book. Mathematics only requires a flexible mind and doing a lot of practice... When dealing with homework, I hope you add interest to it. We must have appropriate allocation of energy, and our bodies and minds must have suitable adjustments. When reading to a certain point, please do not neglect exercise, taking a walk, practicing boxing, which are most beneficial. Wasting your body is as disappointing as wasting your studies. You are even more hardworking children from difficult backgrounds, and nutrition is out of the question. At the same time, many people's enthusiasm is placed on you, so you must not disappoint them, so pay attention to your body in addition to your studies.

I remember Mr. Wu Zhihui's three major elements for students:

(1) Bright and happy.

(2) Useful.

(3) Honest.

Happiness is important. No matter how poor and difficult we are, many adult histories tell us that poverty is the whip that encourages us to move forward.

Editor's note: The writer has seen many scholarship applications submitted to this newspaper, most of which describe their own circumstances and educational aspirations in a sad way, and there are also on-site investigation reports from various gentlemen: living in a corner of poverty, wearing ragged clothes, a sad picture of scholars, truly sad and real, giving me unparalleled emotion. Du Fu said: "How can I get thousands of mansions to shelter all the poor scholars in the world," but it is only sympathy for the same illness, and I am powerless. However, after sobbing, I got a kind of inexplicable comfort: only in poverty can we make progress, the so-called put to death and then live, the aspirations of the poor scholars are very ambitious, if they do not give up, they will succeed. What kind of person is Shun, what kind of person am I, those who have the ability are also like this. However, in this struggle process, I hope to overcome all difficulties and cultivate our noble spirit well. The material environment of the students has been fully shown in the eyes and writings of the gentlemen, and the mental distress is probably only known to those who have experienced it. Most of the students cried out loud when they stated their cases, no wonder, but please keep optimism in your heart at all times, and various material things such as malnutrition, poor and cramped housing, are already inferior to others, and mental distress will destroy the health of the body, and thus fall into mental illness, then it is difficult. Only with a healthy body can there be a healthy mind, please think twice. This should also be the case in a simple and arduous academic career. The ancients hung their heads and pricked their thighs, and collected fireflies to illuminate the snow, which were passed down as beautiful stories, but may I ask, if there is no strong body, coupled with moderate labor, and spiritual cultivation, their hard work will only be entangled with the demons of disease, how can they realize their ideals? What Mr. Xintang said is due to his previous lack of physical training, "focusing only on reading the books in front of him, and not opening his ears to things outside the window," the method is too old, and there are many drawbacks, please students also pay attention to the necessity of labor and cultivation at the same time, so that they can reach the perfect state.

Eleven Midnight Song

That person did not answer, but first sized up Mei Bao with a very funny expression.

"Why not? She has a pair of hands, as long as she can pick up the ruler and hit her own unfeeling child with force. What's wrong with being a teacher?"

Mei Bao also laughed, and at the same time, she remembered that he was Zhao Uncle, who had come to Zhangshu Village to see them three or four years ago, from the middle-aged man's funny attitude and laughable words.

Zhao Uncle seemed to have been here for several days. This time, he even brought many things that could not be bought in the countryside, and a large bag of unopened Western candies. Although the clothes he was wearing were still as old and worn as last time. This evening, because Mei Bao had also brought back some food from the city, plus a basket of freshly steamed dumplings and a few stir-fried dishes made by Xiao Gouzi, everyone ate very happily. Qiu Haitang and his daughter both poured several glasses of Wujiapi for Zhao Yukun, and he and Xiao Gouzi rushed to eat and drink like crazy, until the last two bottles of Wujiapi he brought were also emptied, before he was willing to put down the cup and chopsticks in his hand.

"Lao Er, it seems that you will not be able to change your sky-is-falling-down-I-don't-care temperament even when you are old!"

Qiu Haitang stood against the wall, watching Xiao Gouzi and Mei Bao clean up the dishes, and said to Yukun with a smile.

"Isn't it good this way? Otherwise, how could I be able to be happy like it's New Year's every day?" Yukun stood up from the bench with staggering steps. "Tonight is very good, I still have to go around a few circles outside the village!" (185)

### Reading Editorials

— Li Jialin

Essential for Youth

Today's Shanghai is full of depravity and filth in many places.

What young people study in their spare time is either peach-colored reports or gray news, and the general reading materials are too bad. But we have to look for the reading materials that our young people need in today's major newspapers. There is no doubt that the editorial is one of the main ones, but I know that there are probably not many people who read it every day, because it is still a relatively tedious task.

Mr. Chen in our school is still tutoring us for free during the summer vacation. He told us to read editorials, and temporarily designated us to read the Shenbao editorials every day. Mr. Chen said: There are many excellent materials in the editorials. It is not easy to collect these materials at ordinary times, and the literary value of the editorials is also very valuable. There are many satisfactory aspects to the application of idioms and the structure of sentences, especially the ability to be relevant.

As for what is the biggest gain for us to read editorials? That is, reading it can make us more aware of the current international situation. We know that in the editorials, the commentary on the international situation is quite thorough, and the insights are quite superb. In today's turbulent world, we are not fools, not blind people, how can we not care about the evolution of today's international situation? To be honest, the evolution of the international situation has a great relationship with our country and ourselves. I am really sad that there are some so-called senior Chinese people, so-called intellectual youths, who are very concerned about peach-colored reports and gray news! But if you talk to them about the current international situation, they will be irrelevant and talk nonsense, or when they are unhappy, they may say to you that they do not want to talk about current affairs.

Finally, I want to say that I do not want to attack those who are indifferent to the world situation, but I advise everyone to read editorials, especially young people. I believe that my motivation cannot be considered bad!

### A Lot of Nonsense

— Huanjun

B: No! This morning, I was taking the entrance exam for that school, and there is probably no problem with being admitted.

A: Oh...

### What's So Funny?

— Translated by Wu Rurong

"Where did you go just now?" The manager was unhappy. "To the barber to get a haircut." "You can't use office hours to do your private affairs." "Isn't my hair growing during office hours too?" "Not all of it." "Therefore, I didn't shave my hair clean."

The voice on the phone: "Hello, can you please ask the doctor to come to my house immediately? My child swallowed a needle." The doctor's maid: "The doctor is busy operating on a patient right now. If you need the needle right away, I can send one over first."

When a wealthy man was visiting a hospital, he was touched by the exquisite equipment inside, so he said to the head nurse: "If I have an accident on the road in the future, I hope to come here to recuperate." The head nurse said: "Sir, having an accident is not enough. There must be a physiological miracle, because this is a women's hospital!" (Remuneration for Scholarship Fund)

### The Annals of the Chrysanthemum Kingdom

— Deng Xiaoxian

(1) The Tongtian Sect Leader Has a Full House of Disciples (Part 1)

Speaking of the North Country Pear Garden, there is a Tongtian Sect Leader, that is, the well-known Wang Yaoqing boss. Speaking of Wang Yaoqing, he can be called a generation of famous actors. In those days, he and Tan Da Wang called the sky to match, and his reputation really filled the north and south of the Yangtze River. In terms of art, his skills really have unique places, especially in performing Qizhuang opera and Daomadan opera, which is really unmatched by ordinary people. In recent decades, Yaoqing has been old, and limited by his voice, so he no longer puts on makeup and goes on stage, but amuses himself by teaching his disciples. Yaoqing originally had a lot of disciples, and in the past ten years, he has been engaged in teaching his disciples, and people have flocked to join Wang's family. Therefore, the ancient Mao Xuan (Yaoqing's self-proclaimed ancient Mao Xuan) has a full house of disciples, and the number of disciples is countless. Therefore, his colleagues gave him the title of "Tongtian Sect Leader". Some people say that the four words "Tongtian Sect Leader" contain two meanings besides the above reasons: one is that he has a wide belly, knows a lot of skills, and has boundless magic; the other is that although he has boundless magic, he is a heretic, so he is called "Tongtian Sect Leader". Otherwise, why not call him "Original Heavenly Venerable"? Although the words are a bit like that, they are actually reasonable.

Someone asked me Wang Yaoqing. How many disciples are there in the end? In this section, it is really necessary to write it out and tell the readers. According to Yaoqing's own statistics, there are Guo Xianglin, Luo Xiaobao, Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, Shang Xiaoyun, Xiao Cuihua, Wang Yifang, Jiang Miaoxiang, Rong Diexian, Huang Yulin, Ma Yanbing, Wang Yunfang, Dai Yanwan, Wu Lanfang, Guo Xiaoqing, Li Jizhi, Cheng Yuqing, Zhao Tongshan, Li Lingfeng, Jin Biyan, Li Xiangyun, Nan Tiesheng, Wang Shengyi, Sun Chengfang, Su Jingzi, Zhang Xiaoshan, Song Dezhu, (above are male)

Mr. Deng Xiaoxian, a special writer for this publication, wrote "Annals of the Chrysanthemum Kingdom", which is novel, tortuous, interesting and meaningful. Please pay attention to it, readers. (Editor)

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Shuo Mingdao

Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan's Small Characters, Delicate Gauze

The lyricist, upon hearing Yuan Yuan's words, scratched his head and sighed, saying, "Yuan Yuan, of course, I don't want anything bad to happen to you. It's just that regarding our matter, my mother has already agreed, but my father still won't budge. It can only be realized after I pass the autumn examination, so I have to wait patiently, preparing to make a name for myself in one fell swoop, and our good fortune can also be fulfilled, and my father won't object. How can I open my mouth to my father now? Moreover, if I want to free you from the registry of entertainers, I have to spend a lot of money in front of your adoptive mother. How can I get that money in a snap?" After the lyricist finished speaking, he sighed again for a long time, rubbing his hands frequently, but all in vain. Yuan Yuan said, "I regret going on that Lingyan trip with you the day before yesterday, otherwise, I wouldn't have met that Tian Hongyu." The lyricist said, "It's useless. Since Tian Hongyu came here, how could he not want to visit the beautiful women of Jiangnan? Your fame has long been all over the southeast, how could he not know? Moreover, his father has that 'butterfly' there encouraging him. The 'butterfly' originally wanted to find a way to ruin us because she was jealous of our love. Even if we didn't meet at Lingyan, she would have led him to you." Yuan Yuan stamped her small foot and said, "That bastard is too hateful! Is it really my fate to be afflicted by evil stars? You love me, but if, unfortunately, what you fear becomes a reality, what will we do? It's better to be prepared. Can't you think of a good way?" Yuan Yuan said, her voice trembling slightly, tears welling up in her eyes, almost about to cry. Seeing her like this, the lyricist really had no good plan for a while, and he felt very uncomfortable, as if needles were pricking him. After a while, he scratched his head with his hand, then clenched his fist and knocked on the table, like an ant on a hot pan. After a long time, he blurted out, "Then...then...what should we do? Shouldn't you move again?" Seeing him so embarrassed, Yuan Yuan felt both pity and annoyance. She frowned and then said, "According to me, there is only one way, which is for you and me to leave here together tomorrow night and avoid meeting them. Then Tian Hongyu won't be able to do anything to us."
