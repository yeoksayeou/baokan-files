Government Spokesperson Reports on the Battle Situation to Newspaper Reporters

Chongqing: The Chinese government spokesperson told newspaper reporters this afternoon that Changsha is still in the hands of the Chinese army. The Chinese army is determined to defend the city at all costs. Regarding the future of Changsha, the Chinese side believes it is very hopeful. Chongqing was still able to communicate with Changsha by telephone this morning. The city is no longer an important food and transportation center because the Chinese side has made all necessary preparations to cope with the Japanese offensive. All highways and railways within a 50-mile radius of the city have been systematically destroyed. Currently, the Japanese army closest to Changsha is still eight miles from the city. Changsha reported at 9 AM this morning that the situation has not changed. The Japanese army is still holding the Laotang River, which they reached on September 27th. The Japanese side claims to have entered Changsha on the evening of September 27th, stating that hundreds of Japanese paratroopers arrived in the northern suburbs at that time. However, according to a telephone call from Changsha on the evening of September 28th, all Japanese troops have been cleared. After crossing the Miluo River, the Japanese army advanced southward in four routes. The main force on the left flank advanced along the main highway northeast of Changsha, while the right flank attacked along the Yuehan Railway, reaching the Laotang River north of Changsha and then being unable to continue their advance. At the same time, the Chinese army operating behind the Japanese lines has begun to encircle them from the east, west, and north. The eastern route advanced westward along the main highway, the western route attacked the railway line, and the northern route moved south from the Miluo River. As a result, 100,000 Japanese troops along the north bank of the Laotang River were surrounded. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

Editorial

### Post-War World Reconstruction

Considering that the thoughts and lives of modern humans are turbulent and dazzling, the speed of their evolution is truly like lightning too fast to cover one's ears, and there are things that are incredible. Today, the diligent and self-improving efforts of the nations are aimed at seeking a way for humans to conquer nature and contribute all their gains to humanity, so as to enhance the common enjoyment of welfare as the individual or collective way of life. This kind of issues such as the construction of the future world or the transformation of human civilization, regardless of whether there is an interruption of war, are brewing into the central issue of the world at this stage in a subtle way, and it has long been recognized by philosophers, and we should not be afraid of rhetoric and have repeatedly elaborated on it.

President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill held talks on the ship. Most of the content is kept secret, but its scope is broad. And it is undoubtedly aimed at resolving various issues with the lives of people around the world as the destination. Therefore, the future trend of human life after the war will inevitably be found in this "Atlantic Charter of Human Rights".

Recently, a scientific conference is being held in London, and its purpose is the post-war world construction, first of all, how to maintain the lives of the people in the invaded countries as a prerequisite, as well as all adjustments in the mode of production and the economic system. It can be seen that the world construction in the future will focus on the transformation of the entire economic structure. The trend of the major revolution in economic life has become clear.

The British representative explained that the post-war production mechanism is incomplete, and it is impossible to restore the old view in a short period of time. Therefore, some countries must be responsible for supplying other ethnic groups, just as the countries in the Democratic Front must rely on the United States to supply armaments. But the issues involved in production methods and transaction policies are profound. For other countries to produce, how will international income and expenditure be settled? Where will the profits come from? What are the standards for trading procedures? There is no conclusion, and we must discuss it at length. Some say that we can follow the path of the past to find a solution, but the result may be to repeat the mistakes after the First World War. Since 1918, the major powers have been exhausted in their efforts to restore the old system, and finally failed and promoted the outbreak of the Second World War. Therefore, the system must be thoroughly transformed, and there is no room for dispute, but how to transform it depends on the joint research and solutions of people from all countries.

What can be predicted in the theory is that in the future, issues such as production, consumption, transaction, and distribution will never be left to the free will of various countries as in the past. The mutual restraint and mutual control between countries will inevitably intensify. If a country with low production efficiency is bound to be oppressed by a country with high production efficiency, so as to give up this production, it is expected. If we want to manufacture cars, but due to the inefficiency of others, we must give up this kind of production attempt, then the future is self-evident. This is the case with production, and so is consumption. Where can we achieve the goal of common enjoyment? This is really worth discussing.

Those who are familiar with modern problems point out that there will be a gold pound group, a mark group, a dollar group, a Soviet group, and a Japanese gold group after the war, each delineating its sphere of influence and accommodating small ethnic groups. In a large range, we will seek to realize a conditional free trade system, and all weak ethnic areas will be reduced to dumping tails or material supply places.

Although it is a recognized argument that the economic system must be reformed in the future, the extent and method of its transformation depends on the evolution of the war and the determination of mankind. Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky's speech can be described as a needle in the eye. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's experience of reform over the past 20 years due to the defects of the private economic system is more than enough. Now, to melt the world's economic institutions into one furnace, its responsibility is far greater and more difficult than the revolution in the Soviet Union.

Now clarify our position and expectations. Our national customs are honest and do not compete with the world, which is well known in the world. In recent years, due to the internal and external troubles, although there have been no major achievements in science to contribute to mankind, it is also our contribution to preserve the great oriental culture and material resources for thousands of years and to supply the needs of friendly countries. We are fighting for sovereignty, and we must fight for national survival. We will make our best efforts to cooperate with the people of friendly countries to seek the happiness of the entire human race, but our free and independent living conditions must be complete and have the support of friendly countries. At the beginning of this world construction discussion, I hope to tell the participants this. And encourage the people of the country!

Japanese Troops in Shantou Will Not Withdraw

Hong Kong: According to reliable sources here, detachments from the Japanese 28th, 104th, and 108th Divisions, who participated in the Fujian Province battles, are now returning to Guangdong Province and are stationed in Shantou, Kowloon, Guangzhou, and Zhongshan County. Because the Japanese troops are being transferred back to Guangdong Province, the Japanese troops in Shantou and other coastal areas are unlikely to withdraw. In the past two weeks, the Japanese defense forces stationed in Guangdong Province, seeing that the Japanese troops in Fujian Province are about to return, have been transferred to Chengkang (transliteration), Taiping Tang, and other northern fortresses to defend Guangdong and prevent guerrilla attacks. Because the tense situation between Vietnam and Thailand has eased, the Japanese warships patrolling the South China Sea are returning north. Three Japanese fleets, including light cruisers, destroyers, troop transports, and minesweepers, can be seen offshore of Shantou this week. These ships are currently returning to Taiwan for repairs. There are forty Japanese naval aircraft parked on the Japanese airfields in Shantou and Nan'ao. These aircraft bombed the Fujian-Guangdong border last week. Other Japanese aircraft are conducting daily reconnaissance flights over the skies of Pinghe, Shao'an, Yunxiao, and Fengshun, because large groups of guerrillas are gathering in the above-mentioned areas. Other Chinese guerrillas are attacking Japanese troops in the Jiangmen Xinhui area, north of Shenzhen, along the Hong Kong-Guangdong Road. It is said that the Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties in August. (International News Agency dispatch from the 29th)

### Professor Pan Chaoying of the United States Talks About the Recent Situation of U.S. Aid to China, Sympathizing with China's War Effort and Providing Assistance, Overseas Chinese Donations are Particularly Enthusiastic

Chongqing: Dr. Pan Chaoying, former professor at Princeton University in the United States, left the United States in August and arrived in Chongqing from Hong Kong a few days ago. When interviewed by reporters about the recent situation of U.S. aid to China, he said that the United States has traditionally been friendly to China and has expressed sympathy for our resistance to Japan since the beginning. However, because there is no immediate conflict of interest, and some people doubt the sustainability of our resistance to Japan, the initial assistance was only spiritual. After the Battle of Shanghai, the heroic fighting of our army became clear, and from doubt it turned into admiration. After the Panay incident, the United States was very angry, and the activities of our national diplomatic envoys in the United States have also been effective. The resistance to Japan has been sustained, which has made the people of that country turn from admiration to material assistance. Among them, Catholics account for one-sixth of the U.S. population, and their donations are very large. Catholics in various places are enthusiastically promoting it. As for the overseas Chinese, the situation is very enthusiastic. In small ports with fewer overseas Chinese, the results of their donations often exceed expectations. The average amount of donations is five yuan per person per month, and whole numbers are not counted. Situ Meitang and Ruan Benwan, leaders of the overseas Chinese in eastern America, have lived overseas for 50 years and are both over 60 years old. Because of the heroic fighting of their motherland, they said that they must return to the country to witness the accompanying capital of the holy war and pay tribute to the leader who is respected by people at home and abroad, so as to have no regrets. They have now put everything aside and will soon set off. Situ and Ruan are highly respected among the overseas Chinese in eastern America and can represent the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for their motherland. As for the U.S.-Japan talks, Pan said that the United States' main goal at present is to help Britain and the Soviet Union defeat Hitler, so it is not impossible to make partial adjustments to the relationship with Japan, but it will never sacrifice our country to accommodate Japan, because there are fundamental factors between the United States and Japan that cannot be resolved. When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech to the Associated Press reporter, he happened to be in Hong Kong. When he asked his British and American friends, they all said that this statement was very (timely) and admired it. International relations are complicated, diplomatic operations are constantly changing, and all of them take their own national interests as the premise. This is a matter of course, but sometimes, because of the righteous and firm proposition, the precarious situation can be slightly saved. Pan, in addition to teaching at the university, has traveled all over the United States and Canada to appeal for aid for the resistance against Japan. He is very accomplished. This time, he plans to introduce the situation of the country's resistance against Japan in friendly countries at any time, so as to fulfill his national duty. (Dispatch from the 29th)

Kathmandu, Nepal, Reuters, 29th: Nepalese Prime Minister Rana said in a speech yesterday that the armies of those whose purposes are upright will be a hundred times stronger, so those who are determined to fight for selfless purposes, such as Britain, will surely win the final victory.

### Red Army of Leningrad Counterattacks, Breaks Through Three German Defense Lines; Two Romanian Brigades Annihilated on Southern Front; Soviet Forces Capture Five Towns on Northwest Front

TASS, Battlefield Report, 29th: The strength of the Leningrad garrison is growing daily. On several lines, the Red Army has repeatedly launched counterattacks. At 5:00 AM on the 26th, the Red Army launched a counterattack against the German positions, which had three strong defensive lines. It first occupied the enemy's first line of defense, and then successively broke through the enemy's second and third lines of defense. Heavy fighting continued from morning to dusk. As a result, all three enemy defensive lines were occupied by our forces. During the night, the enemy attempted a counterattack but failed, suffering extremely heavy losses. The Red Army led by General Botleyev has annihilated 700 enemy soldiers.

TASS, Northwest Front, 29th: The Red Army's anti-aircraft artillery has been extremely effective near Leningrad. Recently, the anti-aircraft artillery unit shot down 49 enemy planes. The fighting was very fierce at the time, and enemy planes could not break through into Leningrad.

Havas, Moscow, 29th: The Information Bureau announced in its war report this morning that our forces fought the enemy on all fronts last night. The Romanian Second and Fourth Brigades on the southern front have been annihilated by our forces.

United Press of America, Moscow, 29th: The positions of the Soviet Red Army in the Leningrad area seemed to have advanced yesterday. The area has been under constant pressure from the German forces for more than a month. News from the front indicates that not only has the Soviet resistance been strengthened, but the strength of the counterattack has also increased. Soviet forces broke through multiple points of the German trenches, each 150 meters apart, outside the suburbs, and seized these well-defended positions. According to the "Red Star" newspaper, the German forces seem to have made no progress. After the Soviet forces launched a counterattack towards Staraya Russa, 125 miles south of Leningrad, they strongly broke through the German fortified positions and successively captured five towns with a rapid sweeping posture. It is said that fierce fighting is still continuing in that area. According to information from Ilinka, the German forces concentrated large armies there at the end of the week, which reduced the strength of the neighboring strongholds along the Desna River. According to reports, the German forces have built three rings of fortress-like battlefields on the Desna front. According to reports, Soviet infantry, with the help of artillery, launched an attack on the German forces and forcibly crossed the river, after which they occupied the first line of defense. "Izvestia" reported that after Marshal Timoshenko occupied Ilinka, he expanded the offensive to the neighboring areas of the Esna River and continued to capture ten villages. The Soviets and Germans immediately built new positions within the armed positions previously built by the Germans along the coast.

Reuters, Moscow, 29th: A recent Soviet communique stated that no fewer than 98 German planes were destroyed last Friday, and 36 Soviet planes were also lost. On September 27, two German reconnaissance planes were shot down over Moscow. On the 28th, two German bombers were shot down. The Soviet Northern Fleet sank one enemy transport ship of 8,000 tons and one of 4,000 tons. The coastal artillery and Soviet ships of the Baltic Fleet sank one enemy cruiser and one destroyer each, and heavily damaged two other enemy destroyers. In the Black Sea, one enemy oil tanker of 2,000 tons was also sunk. The announcements regarding land battles were as simple as usual, merely stating, "On September 28, our forces engaged the enemy along the entire front."

United Press of America, London, 29th: Reliable military sources here stated yesterday that the fact that the German forces have not announced any new victories in Ukraine and Crimea proves that the war has turned in favor of the Soviet forces. Although fierce fighting continues in the Crimea, heavy and continuous rains have brought the German mechanized forces to a standstill. Yesterday, this station heard Berlin radio broadcasts reporting that the Red Army had launched many fierce counterattacks.

### German Side Reports That General Potapov Was Ordered to Be Executed by the Soviet Authorities

Haitong News Agency, Nanjing, 29th: General Potapov, the commander of the Southern Front Army Group of the Soviet Army, was secretly shot by the secret police on the 23rd of this month in Stalingrad. According to Soviet prisoners of war east of the Dnieper River, General Potapov received an order of dismissal from Stalin on the 12th. General Timoshenko temporarily replaced General Potapov as the commander of the Southern Front Army Group. On the same day, the secret police sent a plane to transport General Potapov to Stalingrad. On the morning of the 23rd, Kruglov, a confidant of the Director of the Secret Police, briefly interrogated him. Then, at 11:30 AM, he was shot in the secret police prison. General Potapov was born 58 years ago in a poor Cossack farmer's family. At the age of 20, he became a cavalryman. In 1918, he joined the Bolshevik Party and participated in the civil war. In 1919, he was promoted to commander of the First Cavalry Army and helped defend Saritsani (i.e., Stalingrad). At that time, Stalin was the political commissar of Saritsani. In 1935, Potapov was promoted to general. In 1937, he served as the commander of the Moscow Military District and concurrently as the Deputy People's Commissar of Defense. His wife was a descendant of the Russian aristocracy and was shot in 1938. Recently, the Soviet army was annihilated by five armies in Kyiv. This is said to be the reason for the execution of General Potapov.

### Nazi Troops Advance into Kharkov, Attempt to Occupy the Donets Basin

United Press of America, London, 29th: News today stated that the German attack on the isthmus to approach Crimea is showing signs of slowing down, and seems to have launched a fierce attack on Kharkov, still seeking to achieve its goal of reaching the Donets Basin. According to various reports, the "spearhead" of Nazi mechanized divisions and motorized infantry is engaged in fierce fighting with Soviet troops east of Poltava along the Kharkov railway line. The remnants of the Soviet troops trapped east of Kyiv are still fiercely resisting the Nazis. It is heard that General Potapov reorganized the communist troops in Kharkov after withdrawing from Kyiv in an attempt to prevent the German troops from invading Kharkov, because Kharkov is the largest industrial city in eastern Ukraine and the lock of the Donets Basin, and is the gateway to one of the main routes to the Caucasus. Currently, it is raining everywhere on the entire front. The activities of millions of soldiers and machines have entered the 100th day of the German-Soviet war. Both sides are making great efforts to fight one of the unprecedented wars in the world. The situation on the entire front is not very clear at present, but according to various reports, the Soviet army still maintains a dominant position on the central front. It is heard that the troops of Marshal Timoshenko have launched a new counterattack to relieve the crisis in Leningrad. The Leningrad area still seems to be unchanged, but it is heard that Marshal Voroshilov has launched a counterattack in Staraya Russa, 150 miles south of Leningrad. However, the German's great offensive seems to be concentrated on Kharkov, which guards the Caucasus oil fields. The Germans have not yet gained a foothold on the Crimean Peninsula, but the battle for the isthmus is still underway, because the isthmus is the main entrance to Crimea. British military experts said that they have no reliable news to prove that the German advance in the Sea of Azov is not a mistake. Some people believe that the Germans may be planning an attempt to enter Moscow, so that they can flank Timoshenko from Orel and Tula to achieve a record of achievement far exceeding the Battle of Kyiv.

### US-Japan Policies on the Far East Are Diametrically Opposed; Economic Warfare Exists in Fact; Danger of Shooting War Is Extremely High

United Press of America, New York, 29th: The danger of a shooting war between the United States and Japan today is considered to be the greatest that the two Pacific nations have ever had since their relationship began. A bloody battle is inevitable, which is what everyone is speculating about. Many Americans in Washington and the Far East believe that in the near future, the possibility of our troops fighting in the Pacific is greater than in the Atlantic. But most impartial observers say that neither the United States nor Japan wants a shooting war. The actions of the leaders of both sides are extremely cautious at this time to avoid having to fight

Overt Action

This unprecedented situation has been caused by a long and complex series of events. These events can be summarized as follows: The Washington government is committed to stopping aggression around the world, resolving international disputes legally and peacefully, and maintaining the original state of affairs in East Asia. Japan is committed to uniting East Asian countries and eliminating Western imperialism, such as Britain's rule of Malaya, the Netherlands' rule of the East Indies, and foreign concessions in China. It also allows necessary raw materials, such as oil from the East Indies, to be freely obtained, and at least in theory, will gradually eliminate the white race's rule over millions of Asians. Washington lists Japan as an aggressor and cites the conflict between China and Japan in Manchuria and the undeclared war between Chinese and Japanese troops in mainland China to prove Japan's determination to seize what it wants by force. Tokyo does not recognize the responsibility for aggression and says that the outbreak of the Manchuria and China wars was due to China's violation of agreements and unlawful acts. According to Japan's view, Japan's establishment of its own scope of interests in East Asia with the Japanese Monroe Doctrine is as reasonable as the United States' self-recognition as the leader of the Manchurian Republic and the representative of American defense.

The Direct Conflict of US-Japan Policies

Seems to be Washington's announcement that it advocates maintaining the original state of affairs in East Asia. If Japan establishes an East Asian national group with Japan as its leader, the original state of affairs in East Asia will obviously not be preserved. Although the establishment of the East Asian national group has been opposed by Britain and the United States, it has made considerable progress. The "Manchukuo" has become a country with close alliance relations with Japan. Most of China's coastal areas and inland strongholds, such as Hankou and naval military strongholds in the South China Sea, such as Hainan Island, have been controlled by the Japanese army. And the Japanese army is based on the agreement concluded with France to control Vietnam. It is estimated that there are now 50,000 or more Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam, with tanks and aircraft as supplements. In southern Vietnam, Japan controls all the coral islands on the edge of the Spratly Islands, making Japan almost adjacent to the coast of the Philippines. Washington has also taken repeated actions to counter Japan's continued expansion. First, it also blamed Japan for its aggression in Manchuria, followed by a diplomatic announcement to cancel the basic treaties on Japanese-American relations, and to cooperate with China, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies to protect their interests in Southeast Asia by borrowing military supplies. In fact, economic severance with Japan and assistance to the Soviet Union, which the Japanese army has long regarded as an enemy. Economic warfare between Japan and the United States has been realized for several weeks, but the

diplomatic relations

Are still maintained. It is expected that it will be maintained until an open action breaks out. There are many possibilities for open action, including the following: Japan's implied threat to intercept other American ships carrying gasoline and other items to the Soviet Far East port of Vladivostok. Japan argues that the establishment of the American arms route to Vladivostok will strengthen the Soviet Union's Far East army fighting against Germany, Japan's ally, and will create military preparations that the Soviet Union may use to deal with Japan, or may make the Soviet Union lend part of its arms to China for continued warfare against Japan. If an American ship is intercepted by a Japanese warship, an explosive situation will occur within two weeks. The decision is the large-scale stationing of Japanese troops in Vietnam adjacent to Thailand. Thailand is what Britain and the United States want to protect, because Thailand controls the points where American supplies are transported into China via the famous Burma Road, which passes through British Malaya, Singapore, and Burma, and is under control. It is believed that if the Japanese army enters Thailand, Britain will fight Japan if it is determined to obtain American military assistance. Finally, it is manifested in the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the three powers that the Axis considers the backbone of the order. If President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill want to fulfill their promise to eliminate the threat of Hitler's military institutions, then this alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan must obviously be destroyed by Britain and the United States using pressure.

### Turkish-German Economic Negotiations Proceed Smoothly; Reportedly to Be Signed Soon

Havas, Istanbul, 20th: Responsible persons here recently said that the economic negotiations between Turkey and Germany have been successfully concluded and a preliminary agreement has been reached. Once the German authorities finally approve it, it can be formally signed. Sir Krodius, the chief representative of the German economic delegation, is expected to visit the capital today, but this trip is purely private in nature, and he will take the opportunity to meet with the German Ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Mabon. As for the British Embassy, it does not attach importance to the results of this trip by the German economic representative. The German side only said that the negotiations were proceeding smoothly. It is said that trade between Turkey and Germany has been suspended since August 1939 for two years. After the establishment of the new Chamber of Commerce, the police will almost certainly be able to resume trade.

### Anti-German Activities Surge in the Occupied Territories of Czechoslovakia; Nazis Announce Martial Law in Six Places; Prime Minister Elias of Bohemia Arrested

Haitong News Agency, Prague, 29th: During the visit of Dr. Hácha, President of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the German Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, General Heydrich, announced that General Elias, Prime Minister of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, had been arrested on charges of treason and would be tried by the People's Court. He also reported that a state of emergency had been declared in Prague, Brous, Mariachi, Ostrava, Kladno, and Olomouc because of recent anti-German activities in various places, which were launched by elements bought by the enemy.

Havas, Berlin, 28th: The semi-official agency "Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur" recently issued a message stating that Heydrich, the German Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, and Frank, the leader of the National Socialist Storm Troopers, visited President Hácha today and immediately told him the reasons and motives for declaring martial law in places such as Xi Lagu. They also said that in recent days, some unwilling people have accepted subsidies from European enemies and are active everywhere, attempting to use propaganda methods to make the people of the two states oppose Germany. They deeply hope that all the people can clearly understand that they share the same fate as the people of European countries, and under no circumstances can they be used by Germany's enemies. Prime Minister Elias of the two protectorates has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rebel and will be tried by the People's Court. President Hácha replied in writing at 2:30 PM, stating that the government authorities are willing to cooperate in suppressing the rioters and appealed to the people to assist the government.

### Change of Nazi Protector; Iron-Fist Rule to Be Implemented

Reuters, London, 29th: Because of the Czech people's passive resistance, secret sabotage, or open rebellion, one after another, like a tide, making it difficult to cope with, Neurath, the Nazi Protector of Bohemia and Moravia in the Czech Republic, will transfer his post to Heydrich, the young leader of the Blackshirts, because he is 68 years old and his energy is not enough to cope with it. He is the deputy commander of the secret police. After taking office yesterday, he issued an order announcing the state of emergency in six places in the two protected provinces. Those who resist the Nazi regime will be punished immediately. London observers believe that this is a prelude to the indiscriminate detention of people in the Czech Republic and execution on the slightest suspicion. At the same time, there is a rumor that Dr. Duka, the Prime Minister of Slovakia appointed by the Nazis, was assassinated unsuccessfully, and that Iris, the Prime Minister of the Protectorate Government, was also detained for committing treason. There have been strikes in Czech military factories and textile factories from time to time. The military and police arrested trade union members and threatened to shoot them if they did not resume work, but the strikers said that if those arrested were shot, the workers would never enter the factory. Slogans of the V-word movement and slow work have been found in various towns in the Czech Republic. Recently, there have been repeated cases of machines being damaged for no reason, trains derailed, factory orders being wrong, and goods being delivered incorrectly.

Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th: According to news received by Czechs here, the state of emergency declared in Bohemia and Moravia in the two provinces now stipulates that those who commit crimes will be tried by military courts. Once convicted, they will be executed and no appeal is allowed.

### First Death Sentence in Czech Territory; Six People Executed by Firing Squad

Reuters, London, 29th: German radio said that the first death sentence issued by "European Executioner" Heydrich under the state of emergency in the Czech "Protectorate" has been carried out yesterday. A total of six people were executed by firing squad.

Reuters, London, 29th: News of resistance to the Germans is coming from all over Europe. Yesterday, two planes collided in Slovakia, killing a total of five people. Paris newspapers reported that the Germans had executed 20 people in retaliation for a series of explosions on various railways. Guerrillas in Yugoslavia sank one German and one Italian ship each in the port of Dubrovnik, destroyed railway traffic, and attacked German and Italian troops, killing more than 200 soldiers and seizing rifles and bullets.

Reuters, Bern, 29th: The appointment of Heydrich as Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia to replace Neurath is seen here as evidence that resistance to German rule in the occupied countries is becoming increasingly strong. In this regard, newspapers reported that the number of people executed by the Germans in the French occupied areas is increasing, and guerrilla warfare in the Southern Territory is also becoming more active. Czechs and other Slavs are optimistic about the results of the Soviet resistance to German aggression and hate the Germans even more. According to the National Daily, the German appointment of Heydrich proves that occupying Bohemia and Moravia has recognized the need to implement an iron-fist regime in the two provinces. Heydrich ranks second in the secret police. He killed many people in the cleansing operation at the end of June 1934. The Germans are all afraid of him and consider him one of the most brutal Nazis.

### Guerrillas Extremely Active in the Territories of Southern Romania and Norway

Reuters, London, 29th: According to Moscow Radio, Raboviz, the leader of the Southern National Youth Party, claimed yesterday at the Anti-Fascist Youth Congress in Moscow that the Southern National guerrillas had destroyed 200 bridges, bombed 400 gunpowder depots, destroyed 17 trains, and killed nearly 10,000 fascists in two months. France's independent communications received news from Istanbul that although Kwisling in Southern National called on the people to lay down their arms and surrender to Germany, this generation made more patriots increase sabotage. The German side sent three new divisions into Southern National to carry out suppression, but bridges were still being bombed and railways were being excavated. Those who arrived in the Turkish territory from Southern National all said that the main railway between the capital of Southern National and Nis has now been destroyed, and railway traffic in Bosnia has also been suspended.

TASS, Moscow, 28th: Recently, there have been repeated factory explosions and railway accidents in Romania. A German military train heading to the front a few days ago derailed, killing more than 100 fascists. From September 10 to 20, four German food depots in Craiova, Timisoara, and Oradea caught fire. Every day, trains carrying munitions are burned. In view of the increasing number of strikes and sabotage, Romanian newspapers have published an official order stating, "Those who engage in strikes will be shot on the spot."

Reuters, London, 29th: Independent French communications reported from Oslo that a nitric acid factory in Telemark Province, Norway, "caught fire spontaneously" on Saturday. The factory's laboratory and valuable materials were completely destroyed.

Reuters, Berlin, 29th: The German News Agency said that the Sofia Court will begin hearing the cases of 35 spies on October 20. They were previously hired by Britain and Southern National and planned to launch a revolution in the territory of Southern National in the spring of this year. Among them are five foreigners, including Norman Davies, an intelligence officer at the British Embassy in Sofia. Their leader is Georgi Dimitrov.

### British and Soviet Military Authorities Discuss Caucasus Defense, Joint Defense of Major Oil Wells Planned, Railway Transportation Improvement Being Planned, General Wavell to Return to India from Iran

Reuter, Tehran, 29th - General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, arrived here by plane at 5 PM on the 27th to discuss the Caucasus defense and other matters with the Soviet authorities. In addition to discussing the joint defense of Iran and its major oil wells, he will also study the methods being prepared by the British staff to transport supplies to the Soviet Union. Several batches of Indian jute and cotton have already been delivered to the Soviet side. Currently, they are busy drafting a reorganization of the poorly managed Persian-Soviet railway system and establishing a large-scale road transportation company, so that supplies can be transported in large quantities and continuously. If it is necessary to meet with the Commander-in-Chief of the Caucasus region bordering the Soviet Union, he may fly to Tbilisi. He told reporters that according to the latest plan, this trip is unlikely to materialize. Five years ago, he visited the Soviet Union to attend army exercises. When he received reporters on the morning of the 29th, he said that he did not think it was necessary to establish a joint British-Soviet command, but plans for closer cooperation between the two armies are now being drafted. A reporter told him that some foreign radio commentators speculated that British troops would be transferred to the Caucasus. He replied that foreign radio commentators are not always correct and that he did not have time to study the problem of how to use Persian troops if Persian territory is attacked. He also said that he believes that the Soviet navy is still active along the Black Sea coast, and the Germans will inevitably advance around it. To eliminate this Soviet fleet, they must occupy all its bases or transfer the Italian navy to the Black Sea. If this is the case, the Italian navy will have to forcibly pass through the Dardanelles Strait or seek Turkey's consent to pass through, but Turkey has no intention of permitting this. He seems to be staying here for a day or two longer. He had a long discussion with Soviet General Novikov. The aircraft he came on was a large Douglas airliner, the first aircraft to land here since the incident. The time taken to fly from London to Tehran can be considered a new record under ? conditions. The British ambassador hosted a lunch and dinner to welcome him. He is expected to return to India either tomorrow or the day after. Before leaving, he may travel by car to Sultanabad and Hamadan to inspect British troops.

Reuter, Simla, 29th - It was officially announced here this afternoon that last Friday and Saturday, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, and General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, held an important meeting in Poona to discuss detailed cooperation methods between India and the Middle East regarding the anti-Axis front currently established from Syria through Iraq and Iran to the left flank of the Soviet army.

### India Plans to Evacuate Residents

### British House of Commons to Meet

Reuter, London, 29th - When the House of Commons reconvenes shortly, Prime Minister Churchill will present the latest developments in the war situation.

United Press, New York, 29th - Secretary of Agriculture Wickard announced yesterday that the government hopes to supply Britain with about a quarter of its food needs in the next twelve months. This food will include flour, milk, dried eggs, beef, poultry, etc.

### Germany and France Discuss Changes to Armistice Conditions, German Troops Still Stationed in France, Petain Government May Return to Paris

Reuter, Stockholm, 29th - A local newspaper published a dispatch from Berlin stating that Berlin and the Vichy government are currently conducting important discussions aimed at establishing more satisfactory relations. Although a separate peace is unlikely to be concluded, it is expected that the original armistice conditions can be made more flexible than before. Although the occupying forces will still be stationed in France, the Petain government and the entire civil administration can return to Paris, and direct diplomatic relations between the two countries can be maintained by the French embassy in Berlin. However, both France and Germany will outwardly refer to them as diplomatic missions, without the title of ambassador or minister.

Havas World News Agency, Vichy, 28th - The German authorities in occupied France executed another twenty anti-German elements in Lille today. The "Paris Midi" and "Le Temps Nouveau" published a German announcement stating that "on the night of the 22nd of this month, a number of armed thugs stole a large amount of explosives from a military arsenal and destroyed military trains on the 24th and 25th. This was clearly done by the Communist Party. Our military authorities have executed twenty radical communists as retaliation."

### British and American Representatives Arrive in Soviet Union, Expecting to Meet Stalin in Person, Formal Meeting Began Yesterday

Reuter, Moscow, 29th - The British Chief Delegate, Beaverbrook, and the American Chief Delegate, Harriman, who are attending the Moscow Conference, both arrived here last night. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, Secretary-General of the Foreign Affairs Committee Sobolev, Chief of Staff Golikov, and the British and American Ambassadors to the Soviet Union all welcomed them at the airport.

Reuter, Moscow, 29th - After the British and American representatives arrived in Moscow yesterday, Stalin met with them at the Kremlin that evening. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet delegation, and former Foreign Minister Litvinov, a member of the delegation, were also present. Harriman told the guests that time is of the essence, so we must work quickly. American planes and aviation fuel have already arrived in the Soviet Union. The United States is preparing to provide powerful assistance to the Soviet Union's magnificent war effort. He also said that the Germans have repeatedly attempted to bomb Moscow, but Moscow has never been scarred by bombs, which is very strange. He visited Moscow in 1926, and after more than ten years, he is amazed by the progress of the Soviet capital's construction.

United Press, Moscow, 29th - Some members of the British and American delegations have arrived here several days ago to engage in the basic work of the Three-Power Conference. This conference will form a long-term program to aid the Soviet Union, and will also discuss how to allocate war materials that are not needed for the US military buildup to the Soviet Union, as well as the British mainland, the Near East, the Far East British army, and certain British production that can be shipped to the Soviet Union.

International News Service, Moscow, 29th - British, American, and Soviet representatives agreed on preliminary measures for aid to the Soviet Union yesterday at the Kremlin. Formal meetings will be held starting today, lasting about a week.

Reuter, London, 29th - The British Ministry of Supply recently stated that in the week before Tank Aid to the Soviet Union Week, tank production had exceeded previous records, but the achievement of Tank Aid to the Soviet Union Week exceeded the previous week by two-tenths. Saturday and Sunday saw the highest daily production levels. The production of the last three days of Tank Aid to the Soviet Union Week was greater than any previous three days.

### Yarn and Cotton, Taking Advantage of Expensive Mixed Yarns, Shuang Ma Factory Singles Were All Bought Up, Prices Raised to Over 1840 Yuan

The yarn market is trending strong, and the price increases are very intense. This is because mixed and Japanese yarns are expensive, so the sales of Shuang Ma Factory singles have improved. As a result, the chips are gradually tightening and shrinking. Although the courage of short sellers is sharp, they have no way to deliver because the delivery chips are dry. In addition to the discount, swaps have to be offset. Therefore, Shuang Ma Factory single yarns, which have been held for many days, suddenly show signs of rising. The sales in Guangdong are still not weak, but not as prosperous as yesterday. The transaction of coarse yarn in Nanyang is continuous. Some people say that some telegrams have not yet been forwarded. The high price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn is 1831 yuan, and the low price is 1807 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was enthusiastic, and short positions were offset. Initially, it was made at 1840 yuan, rising to 1841 yuan. Then, profit-takers released, and it fell to 1826 yuan. At the close, it rose again to 1835 yuan. Today, 126 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Singapore, and 735 pieces were exported to Hong Kong.

The Shuang Ma market opened higher in the morning due to purchases. Although the short side sold, there were actual buyers. The first plate price was 5808 yuan, and it soon rose to 1819 yuan. Afterwards, profit-takers offered, causing the market to level off and fall back to 1815 yuan. It fluctuated between 17 and 18 yuan for a long time.

### Mitterrand Raised to 800 Yuan, Nearly 10,000 Pieces of New Indian Cotton Arrived

The spot cotton situation is still outstanding. Because the yarn market has risen, those who squeeze cotton are even more tight-lipped, so the market will not sell unless the price is high. Transactions have rebounded and become active. Those who have profited see their goals fulfilled, and there is no shortage of release to meet demand. The factory, in view of the unsatisfactory source, has to replenish it at any time to pay for the application. However, the public's strangeness and boredom are still competing to absorb, resulting in extremely healthy trading colors. Yesterday, the Mitterrand entered by the Da Kang Yarn Factory, the factory price has risen to 800 yuan, but it must be paid in silver in November.

### Current Exchange Settlement Method: British and American Merchants Fully Support, Willing to Sacrifice to Ensure Thorough Effectiveness, Abide by National Laws and Cooperate with China, Foreign Exchange Allowed for Considerable Amounts of Tobacco, Gasoline, Cotton, Hemp, Sugar, etc.

Several foreign business leaders and bankers, regarding the trial implementation of the Stabilization Fund's supply of foreign exchange, have encountered difficulties since its implementation. Therefore, they convened several meetings last week to study constructive measures and drafted a proposal. They sent representatives to Hong Kong with the proposal to be presented to the Stabilization Fund for reference and to explain everything in person. According to information obtained by the Dazhong News Agency reporter, the purpose of this action is to report on the past foreign exchange settlement situation and to present opinions on unsettled foreign exchange methods. British and American merchants are now firmly expressing that they will disregard all sacrifices and support the Chinese government's policy of managing foreign exchange, ensuring its thorough effectiveness. They would welcome it if the Stabilization Fund could send senior officials to be stationed in Shanghai on a regular basis.

American Merchants Express Sincere Cooperation

The reporter visited Mr. Havass, the secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce, at the Fuzhou Road office yesterday morning. According to him, "He had heard that several well-known commercial firms and insurance companies did hold meetings last week to review foreign exchange issues, but the Chamber did not participate. The information he obtained was roughly similar to what was reported in the newspapers." Mr. Havass also stated that American merchants would certainly earnestly abide by U.S. government laws and, at the same time, cooperate closely with the Chinese side to protect the interests of American merchants.

Current Methods Still Considered Convenient

According to a senior official of the Chartered Bank, the first batch of applications from banks specially authorized to handle exchange business at the new exchange rate were sent to the Stabilization Fund on the 18th of last month. Since all banks were able to carefully handle matters in accordance with the Stabilization Fund's various regulations in advance, most were approved and few were rejected. Generally, it was either a full rejection or a full approval, with very few partial approvals. The applications were directly taken to Hong Kong by air transport. Since the Hong Kong conference revised the trial implementation methods for September, essential goods in Shanghai, such as tobacco, gasoline, cotton, hemp, and sugar, which had been listed as prohibited import items, were also given considerable amounts of foreign exchange. With the scope being large, it is still considered convenient for legitimate import trade. The same will be implemented next month, without the promulgation of new methods. However, as the activities of speculative merchants have been restricted or halted, there will naturally be criticism. The foreign banks that participated in this meeting included only HSBC, Chartered Bank, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase Bank. With September fleeting and October approaching, each bank must conduct a general review, report to the Stabilization Fund, and submit opinions. The banks have accepted the advice of the British and American governments, understand the difficult times, and are willing to sacrifice, resolutely stopping black market transactions. Therefore, it is expected that any suggestions will be constructive, ensuring that the methods are strict and can achieve the political, diplomatic, and economic goals of the Chinese, American, and British governments.

Certain Issues Need Not Be Worried About

As for the outside world's belief that the current methods still have shortcomings, the responsible party's explanation is as follows: (1) From application to approval, due to transportation issues, a considerable amount of time is required. The Stabilization Fund is striving for speedy processing, and the claim of unnecessary delays is not factual. (2) When requesting the supply of foreign exchange, merchants must state the purpose and distribution in the application, and the bank must guarantee its accuracy. Therefore, the Stabilization Fund seems to have no other way to distinguish between legitimate merchants and hoarders and manipulators other than carefully reviewing the authenticity. (3) The foreign exchange settled is limited, and how to allocate it must be changed at any time depending on the actual situation. (4) As for the claim that merchants can apply for foreign exchange from fourteen banks at the same time, this is practically impossible. Only by applying for negotiation of documents with a certain bank can that bank apply on its behalf. Only after the application is approved can the negotiation of documents be handled. If there is any concealment, the Stabilization Fund can easily detect it, so there is no need to worry about this. (5) Regarding the stabilization of the Shanghai foreign exchange market, the Stabilization Fund has already sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to preside over everything. Naturally, foreign banks would welcome it if more senior officials could be sent to Shanghai.

Two Newspapers Denounce Profiteering Behavior

The Stabilization Fund's supply of low-priced foreign exchange to the Shanghai market has a deep and significant impact on Shanghai's economic life. The Continental Daily News published an article yesterday entitled "The Stabilization Fund and Monopoly and Hoarding," criticizing the actions of importers in this port and the Stabilization Fund's measures. It stated that due to the importers' pursuit of profit, the purpose of establishing the Stabilization Fund seems to have been ignored. It should be known that the primary task of stabilization is to wage an economic war against Japan and its Axis countries in the Shanghai market. A simple and easy method would be to completely refuse to supply foreign exchange to the Shanghai market, preventing it from flowing to unfriendly parties. However, the Chinese government and the Allied countries of Britain and the United States are unwilling to allow the economic life of Shanghai and other occupied areas to be manipulated by others. Unfortunately, most importers who enjoy preferential foreign exchange disregard the Stabilization Fund's objectives, take advantage of opportunities, seek only profit, and engage in monopoly and hoarding, just like unscrupulous merchants. According to a recent commentary published in the Millard's Review by foreign economic expert Aris, canned beef cost only US$5.50 per can before the freeze order was implemented, but now it costs US$8. However, in terms of the foreign exchange situation, this price should not have increased. He suggested that small-scale monopoly and non-hoarding should be immediately stipulated as conditions for granting low-priced foreign exchange, and the shortcomings in management methods should be urgently corrected to ensure that profiteering behavior that harms others for personal gain no longer exists, leaving a stain on Shanghai merchants.

Chinese Banks Handle Similarly

Chinese banks in this port were unable to engage in foreign exchange business in principle because they did not have a special license issued by the U.S. government. Later, after the Four Banks (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Bank of China, Farmers Bank of China) intervened, they were still able to request a supply of foreign exchange on behalf of their customers, but they had to be submitted to the Stabilization Fund for approval through the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Chinese banks do not have a direct relationship with the Stabilization Fund, but are mediated by the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications. Currently, each Chinese bank has obtained various application forms from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, distributed them to relevant customers, filled them out according to the format, and then submitted them to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for submission to the Stabilization Fund for approval. The commission originally obtained by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is received by the Chinese banks. Therefore, Chinese banks such as the Continental Bank, Xingye Bank, Kenye Bank, Shiye Bank, Jincheng Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, East Asia Bank, Zhongxing Bank, and Shanghai Bank can all start engaging in foreign exchange business, with all procedures being completely consistent.

### Ashes of Japanese Reporters Transported from Hankou to Shanghai

According to Japanese sources, naval correspondent Imasato Kairyō of the Japanese fleet's reporting department, and naval reporter Nakakura Goana of the Yomiuri Shimbun, were aboard a small boat when it struck a mine at 7 p.m. on the 25th of this month near Baihuazhou, across the Xiang River in Yingtien, Changsha.

### Two Companies Implement Oil Rationing System to Maintain Gasoline Reserves, Asiatic Petroleum Company to Implement Starting Tomorrow, Oil Tankers Expected to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of Next Month

After the implementation of the oil ration card system in this port, gasoline purchases are limited to purchases with a certificate. According to a major oil company, the gasoline supply is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of October. It is also said that each oil company hopes that its customers can fully cooperate with it, and each company will try its best to maintain gasoline reserves so as to avoid taking stricter restrictions again. Regarding the distribution certificate system, Mobil and Texaco have implemented it yesterday, while Asiatic Petroleum Company will implement it starting tomorrow. As for whether the implementation of the distribution certificate system will lead to a reduction in public buses in the city, there is no confirmed news yet. Some car owners told reporters that they will reduce the number of rides to the minimum in the future in order to cooperate with the oil companies. Regarding the arrival of oil tankers in Shanghai by the end of next month, according to shipping industry sources, each large oil tanker arriving in Shanghai can provide the city with enough gasoline for six months.

### USS Henderson About to Depart, Painted with Wartime Colors

Hundred Marines Return Home, About Thirty Replacement Soldiers

The U.S. Navy transport ship USS Henderson will depart Shanghai for the United States in a few days. One hundred soldiers from the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai will return home on this ship. At that time, the number of U.S. troops stationed in Shanghai will decrease slightly, as it is heard that only about thirty U.S. replacement soldiers were brought to Shanghai by the USS Henderson. According to reports, the USS Henderson sailed from North China and arrived in Shanghai for a short stop yesterday morning (the 29th). The ship was previously painted light gray and has now been changed to a blue-black camouflage color. Moored at the U.S. Navy pontoon on the Yangjingbang, it presents an unusual sight.

### President Pierce Ship Returns to Hong Kong, Reason Not Announced, President Line Does Not Release Passenger List According to New Order

The U.S. mail ship President Pierce arrived in Shanghai the night before last and was docked at pontoons 12 and 13, as noted in previous reports. It is now learned that the mail ship departed Shanghai at dawn this morning and is still sailing to Hong Kong, and then directly from Hong Kong to Xiangshan before returning to San Francisco.

Reason for Re-routing Kept Secret

As for the reason why the ship is sailing to Hong Kong and then back to the United States, the company is keeping it secret. However, few passengers from Southeast Asia took the ship to Shanghai, and there are not many passengers returning to the United States from Southeast Asia. More than one hundred people from Shanghai boarded the ship to go to the United States.

Passenger Names Refused to Be Disclosed

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that several Shanghai residents arrived in Shanghai on the President Pierce mail ship from Manila, but their names are unknown because the American President Lines refused to disclose the names of any passengers in accordance with the new order. Their secrecy is as tight as guarding military secrets. It is heard that the company will no longer publish passenger lists for President Line ships, whether incoming or outgoing.

### Golden Prince Ship Released and Sails to Hong Kong

The British ship Golden Prince was previously detained and inspected for nearly two weeks before departure because it was discovered by the Japanese that it was loading a large batch of gauze and miscellaneous goods in Shanghai, intending to sail to Wenzhou. The goods were confiscated, all seized by the Japanese, as reported earlier. It is now learned that the ship was released after the goods were seized, and then repeated the customs clearance last Saturday, leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong that evening.

### French Tram and Bus Fares to Increase Tomorrow and Substitute Vouchers Issued

The French Water and Electricity Tram and Bus Public Transportation Company has recently announced another fare increase, which will be implemented starting tomorrow. The fees for electric lights, motor electricity, tap water, etc., have already been published in newspapers a few days ago, but the fare increase for vehicles was not specified at that time. It is heard that the general idea is to increase the tram fare by 1.3 cents per stop for first class and 2 cents for second class. The bus fare increase is said to be 2 to 4 cents per stop. In order to reduce trouble and prevent a shortage of change, the company has imitated the British bus company and specially printed a pink thick paper one-cent voucher for circulation on various vehicles. One side is printed with "Shanghai French Tram Company", followed by a number, and then "This ticket is worth one cent and can be used on all vehicles of this company. This ticket can be used until noon on December 31, 1941." The reverse side is in French. Because the fares are all odd numbers, a very large number of vouchers have been issued. Starting tomorrow (October 1), the company's trams and buses will implement the new prices.

### Duff Cooper Has No Intention of Visiting Shanghai

### After the Implementation of the Embargo, Domestic Goods Sales to Southeast Asia Increase, Orders Arrive by Mail and Telegraph, Urging Speedy Delivery

The General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs issued Announcement No. 33 on the 24th of this month, stating that starting from that day, all Shanghai goods are prohibited from being transported to the free areas of our country, causing panic and market fluctuations. Prices of various goods have seen both rises and falls, with everyone believing that Shanghai goods will no longer be able to be transshipped to other ports for sale. After it was confirmed that Hong Kong, Yangon, Manila, and other places were not included in the prohibition, people's hearts began to stabilize. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specifically visited a major domestic goods merchant yesterday in order to understand whether the sales of domestic goods to Southeast Asia had been affected. The merchant said that all the exquisite products of major domestic goods factories in the city are still selling well in various territories of Southeast Asia and have not been affected in any way. Furthermore, recently, orders from overseas Chinese in various territories of Southeast Asia have been arriving frequently by mail and telegraph. The goods ordered in the mails and telegraphs are mostly silk fabrics, embroideries, raincoats, enamelware, knitwear, underwear, ties, electric bulbs, glassware, and locally made appliances. The goods are needed urgently. In addition to increasing production to meet the urgent needs of the area, domestic goods factories in the city are striving to improve quality and deliver goods on time to increase credibility. At the same time, they are also being careful with packaging to avoid damage from moisture during transportation. Therefore, the exquisite domestic goods produced by the city's factories are selling even more briskly.

### Woodhead Denies Printing Anti-British Leaflets, Claiming Someone Impersonated Him

British commentator Woodhead recently wrote to the North China Daily News, stating that a friend told him that he recently received an anti-British leaflet entitled "The Greatest Decline in History" and attached a business card printed with the words "Presented by Woodhead." The content imitated the leaflet issued a few months ago related to the automatic donation to the war fund, entitled "The Greatest Crusade," which was first discussed in Gan Wei Lu's Nazi magazine "New China Voice." After reading it, I couldn't help but feel a little surprised. It goes without saying that the business card is a fake, and Gan Wei Lu has impersonated my business card to cover up his propaganda more than once. There is no way to remedy this kind of person except to announce it. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper, please publish it to expose this impersonation.

At about 4 p.m. yesterday, Chief Inspector Feng Baishun, Deputy Inspector Huang Fusheng, Detective Gao Yong'an, and Detective Zhang Huaxuan of the Public Concession Police learned that a large number of pickpockets (commonly known as "falling to the ground") had gathered near the tram station at the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazhi Road. They disguised themselves and went there, resulting in the arrest of six people, including Zhang Yuehua (29 years old, from Jiangbei), Shui Kejun (27 years old, from Jiangbei), Zhu Baohua (31 years old, from Jiangbei), Liu Guzhou (47 years old, from Jiangbei), and Zhang Dage (22 years old, from Jiangbei). After interrogation at the police station, they continued to arrest seventeen accomplices within the concession according to their confessions. They will be transferred to the court for interrogation this morning. Recently, the intersection of North Henan Road in the concession has become an important transportation route. Buses on Route 5 and trolleybuses on Routes 18 and 14 all turn around there. At the same time, the railway station is nearby, so villagers are often targeted by these gangs, losing their luggage and suitcases. This time, they were all caught, and travelers are hoped to be safe.

### Preface to the Collection of Paintings by Ma Mengrong

— Zheng Wuchang

It has been ten years since my deceased friend, Mr. Ma Mengrong, returned to the Dao Mountain. The Xiling Seal Society has collected his posthumous works and is publishing them in photographic form, asking me to write a preface. I recall that fifteen or sixteen years ago, I and Mengrong often visited each other, creating paintings and discussing art, often until dawn. Mengrong was capable of everything in painting, especially excelling in flowers, birds, insects, and fish. He once said that the flowers, birds, insects, and fish in the world, in all their various forms and colors, each have their natural beauty. When taking them into painting, the brush and ink techniques must have considerable cultivation, and the forms and colors must not deviate from their authenticity. Therefore, his works emphasize both form and color, emphasizing form and color to grasp the truth of nature, and emphasizing brush and ink to express the wonders of painting. He does not imitate the ancients, does not follow the trends, does not fabricate things to proclaim his loftiness, and does not engage in clever flattery to lose his nature. Every blade of grass and feather is presented with simplicity and innocence. Examining the style of flower and bird painting in our country, since Xu Huang of the Five Dynasties, the extreme of meticulousness is to admire realism, and the extreme of realism is to admire meticulousness. Meticulousness emphasizes form and color, and its drawbacks are that it is delicate, rigid, and lacks vitality. Realism emphasizes brush and ink, and its drawbacks are that it is strange, rough, and lacks physical principles. Taking the Qing Dynasty as an example, Nantian Wang'an and Xinluo Futang were each masters of their time. Of those who followed Nantian Wang'an, how many did not suffer from being delicate and rigid? Of those who learned from Xinluo Futang, how many did not die from being strange and rough? Mengrong rose up to correct this, emphasizing form and color, and also emphasizing brush and ink. He had the learning and the skills, truly a hero of his generation. His contribution to the flower and bird painting school in our country, establishing a unique method between meticulousness and realism, can be enshrined and sacrificed in a different hall from Nantian and Xinluo. Therefore, Mengrong's death is truly a great loss to the art world of our country. However, while Mengrong was alive, he worked diligently on painting, and his posthumous works are still widely circulated. Those who followed him are almost all over the country. Is there no one to promote and carry it forward? Moreover, he has a brother like Gongyu, who is famous in this era for his epigraphy, calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose. His son and daughter are also able to carry on the family learning. With successors emerging, Mengrong is truly immortal.

### Dr. Shen Yougan Lectures on "Training of Thinking" (Continued)

3. Analysis and Research on the Thinking Process: The process of thinking is very difficult. There are only two methods in psychology: 1. Objective method; 2. Subjective method. The objective method is too subtle, and the tools used are inconsistent, making it impossible for people to observe. Moreover, language and thinking are not the same. Dumb people can also think. If electric current is used to test the thinking dynamics in the brain, there will be no results. Subjective is based on experience and other fantasies, so neither of these two methods has results. Dewey's five-step method is more applicable: First, there must be doubts to arouse thinking; second, analyze its motives; third, make assumptions; fourth, deduce; fifth, verify that it is in line with reality. If the first assumption is found to be incorrect, it is overturned and another assumption is made, so it returns to the third step and re-deduces. More complicated problems can be fully applied, and some assumptions are very obvious and do not need to be verified, then the fourth and fifth steps can be omitted, or it can start from the third step. This is a general method for simple problems. Now let's analyze it further: A (Doubts) Thinking must have motivation, so we must first train the ability to discover problems. There are three motivations: 1. Practical difficulties. This is what we are more familiar with. If the problem is too far away, it will be difficult to solve; 2. Theoretical problems, such as: metals are heavier than water, but small needles can float on the surface of the water. So researchers become suspicious and problems arise; The third type is maintaining face. Most people want to save face. If things fail, they become suspicious of the tools, thinking that the tools harmed them. This kind of suspicious situation is very ridiculous. This kind of thinking is beneficial. The degree of doubt is related to the strength of the motivation. Insignificant difficulties are not enough to arouse thinking, and excessive difficulties can also cause emotional panic and reduce the hope of solving. So the problem should not be too difficult or too easy when training; B (Analysis) The success or failure of analyzing the problem depends on familiarity with the problem. If you are not familiar with the problem, it will be difficult to analyze. Therefore, effective thinking relies on broad and correct knowledge. Acquiring knowledge is also training thinking. However, the knowledge of the current generation is very complex. Experts know a lot about their own industry, but others are the same as ordinary people. Therefore, the goal of education should be both broad and specialized, that is, we should know something about everything, and we should know everything about some things. We must be humble when training, and do not pretend to be an expert; C (Assumption) Assumption is the central link of thinking. Without assumption, there is no way to observe facts. Sometimes there are too many things, and we cannot record everything we hear. We must choose to make assumptions. However, it should not be absurd and unfounded, and not in line with scientific laws. It must be possible to infer facts based on it. However, laws can also be overturned. Many laws were popular in the past but have now been overturned. For example, the theory of relativity is contradictory to Newton's rationalism, and now the theory of relativity has won. Therefore, the initial assumption can be bold about everything, and be careful when publishing. If you are careless, you will become a joke; D (Deduction) Deduction is the most certain step and also the step that is most prone to errors. The most common errors are: 1. The difference between sufficiency and necessity, that is, one condition cannot be regarded as the entire basis; 2. The difference between "is" and "equals", that is, the difference between conceptual things and units; 3. Emphasizing that the conclusion is in line with the facts, regardless of whether the deduction is effective or not. Because deduction needs to be developed, it will be ineffective if you pay attention to intuition; 4. The shortcomings of inaccuracies in ordinary writing cause errors in deduction, such as writing "healthy and beautiful youth" and mistakenly thinking that the father is healthy and beautiful, or "male and female youth" and mistakenly thinking that it is either male or female, etc.; E (Verification) If the result of reasoning is different from the proof, there is still room for overturning. Therefore, observation should pay attention to objective facts to be reliable. If it is only based on subjective and does not conform to the facts, it is unreliable. If a small number of samples are taken to represent general facts when observing, it is dangerous. Training verification must be precise, and those that meet or do not meet the assumptions should be collected together. Do not be固敎成見 (stubbornly stick to preconceived ideas). Training in attitude and aspect is to raise problems in peaceful things, take bold assumptions on the opposite side, and verify them from the statistics of facts, so as to reach a new stage of thinking. (The End)

### Third Line Strategy

— Wu Dai

There are often two ways of looking at things in the world. Hitler's eastward and westward conquests, plundering all of Europe, were certainly a sign of his dominance, but at the same time, he also made the people of all the invaded countries in Europe his enemies. This may be what is called "every advantage has its disadvantages."

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, commentators said that Hitler had three fronts at the same time: the Soviet Union in the east, Britain in the west, and the people in the occupied areas and the disgruntled people in his own country in the abdomen. It is still unknown which side will win the victory on the eastern and western fronts, but commentators mostly believe that Hitler's failure will mostly be on the third front.

However, Hitler was not blind to this so-called third front. He also had his own special strategies for the dissatisfaction of his own people and the resentment of the people in the occupied areas. The former was to use concealment and deception, and the latter was to use oppression and killing.

According to the Manchester Guide, due to the lack of food in Germany, it has banned magicians across the country from performing magic tricks related to food, such as "egg disappearance," "rabbit production in the hat," and "pigeon production in an empty bag," to avoid viewers drooling after watching them.

This is certainly a clever strategy, but it is also a question of how long this strategy can be implemented.

Human Nature

### A Glimpse of American Army Newspapers

— Hua Zhi

After the American army implemented the compulsory conscription system, it obtained a total of 669,500 new recruits. These new recruits were used to living a free life in peacetime. Once they arrived in the army, they could not get used to the disciplined life, and "depression" inevitably occurred. In addition to depression, they expressed their opinions in writing and made them public.

Each new American army unit publishes its own newspapers and periodicals, in which each soldier is free to express his opinions and express his feelings. Since this spring, the production of these newspapers has sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, even more lively than the publications published when they participated in the European War for the first time. Some of these military newspapers are sold publicly, and some are distributed free of charge.

The content and style of the army publications are very similar to those published during the First European War. In other words, they are all about love affairs and related works. When soldiers write, they like to criticize their superiors mercilessly. This style is the same as it was twenty-five years ago. In journalistic terms, it is not uncommon for soldiers to offend their superiors, and it is a miracle for superiors to scold their soldiers.

There are a total of 202 such newspapers for warriors to vent their thoughts, most of which are published every three days. Among them, the most popular and best-selling is the "Panama Coastal Artillery News," which is published in the Quarry Hill Barracks in the Canal Zone. The main writer is a sergeant named "Old Master Taust". The content of the newspaper is full of enthusiasm, and readers are all over the country and abroad. There is also a kind called "Camp Bag", which is issued by the garrison in the Boston Military Station. It is rich in quality, and no other newspaper can compare with it. The entire newspaper has 50 pages the size of a book and has a color cover. It is magnificent and beautiful, and the content is mostly lower-class music. But it is very humorous, happy but not obscene, and teasing but not abusive. For example, the following style is used when revealing people's privacy: "Sergeant, why do you monopolize a certain girl's lunch dance? Let others share a cup of sunflower! Including us!..." "Corporal Peir Quwood has a new crush, also a cunning little thing..." "Why do Sergeant Green's two female companions always come to dance?"

Soldiers' newspapers are a reflection of their lives. For example, during the First European War, the army implemented a system of rationing food according to the number of people, and the soldiers complained a lot. This situation is no longer found now.

However, scandalous news and low-level tastes are not the whole picture of army newspapers. Even the most entertaining military newspaper editors must devote a lot of space to publishing news about army actions, army exercises, and new army equipment, as well as publishing the words and deeds of their superiors and sports competitions. Each newspaper has a special column for military recruiting officers to report news.

There are also a few poets scattered in the army, and their works are sometimes melancholy and sometimes mysterious in conception, but they are mostly light-hearted and value rhyme. The beginning is often:

Say goodbye to my sweetheart New England,

See a tear in her eyes,……

At the same time, there are also many artists in the army who draw wonderful cartoons and publish them in the newspapers. Some ridicule someone for putting a large vegetable fork on the muzzle of the gun to replace the bayonet, while others directly depict someone being tied with the words "left" and "right" on their feet by their superiors to distinguish directions. These newspapers are all checked by the intelligence officer before publication. If they do not leak military secrets or commit serious errors, they can be released.

In short, American army newspapers are full of jokes, not elegant, but ultimately educational. These newspapers are sent to the hometowns of the soldiers, winning a smile from their parents, elders, friends, and relatives, which can also save the trouble of writing letters home.

War

### Burning Pen

— Ke Zhong

When war breaks out, in addition to the victory or defeat on the battlefield, the authorities of the participating countries must also prevent enemy espionage and sabotage. During the First European War, some important scientists manufactured a kind of incendiary bomb that resembled a fountain pen in order to carry out sabotage. Although this incendiary bomb was small in appearance, it had extremely strong burning power, and the heat of its flames could penetrate steel plates, causing great losses to ships and goods sailing from the United States to Europe. Amidst the active American aid to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the American military authorities paid extreme attention to this "burning pen" to prevent sabotage by unruly people.

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

12. Unexpected Trouble

"There's evidence for this! The county police station knows about it!" Autumn Begonia said, sounding very confident. "Because my daughter is a student at the county middle school, and she was abducted by someone named Shang. The principal of the school, Principal Fang, immediately reported it to the police station. Later, the police station even brought in one of Shang's friends for questioning three times. If you don't believe me, you can ask today!"

This was something the patrol officer had not expected! He could swear to heaven that, no matter what, he would never have thought that the daughter of a farmer, dressed in old clothes and from a family in decline, would go to the county middle school.

"So, there's such a thing," he thought. The county middle school was, after all, an institution, and besides, the police station already had a case. If he continued to threaten Autumn Begonia, as Chief Li had instructed, he would be very out of touch. Therefore, his attitude immediately became gentler.

"They lost a son and just randomly try to put the blame on someone. My daughter was clearly abducted to Beiping by his brother-in-law! Does he pretend not to know? If you don't believe me, you can ask him yourself right now!" Autumn Begonia continued angrily.

"My brother is still in Beijing looking for that Shang guy!" Zhang Lao Liu added from the side.

"Alright, since that's the case, let's go back and report first!" The patrol officer automatically took down the awning, made small talk, and left.

### Random Chats in the Chess World: The Future Prospects of Weiqi (Part 2)

— Qu Qing

Currently, although there is no shortage of masters in the country, it would be difficult to compete against Wu Qingyuan. Moreover, they are all relatively old. It seems that there is no one among the younger generation who can shoulder-to-shoulder with Wu Qingyuan. If it is not promoted in time, the future decline is deeply worrying. Although there are many ways to promote it, the ranking of players is the most important. During the Qi and Liang dynasties, there was talk of ranks from first to fifth, but unfortunately the book was not passed down. Later, there were only names such as National Chess Player (derived from Mencius's "Yi Qiu, the best chess player in the country"), National Master, Master, Famous Player, First, Second, Third Hand, and White National Hand, Black National Hand, etc. Their meanings are all vague and not enough to see their true strength. Moreover, at each competition, if there is no original ranking, it is impossible to determine who holds black and white pieces and how many stones to give, which often causes difficulties, indirectly hindering the progress of chess. I occasionally saw a proposed Weiqi ranking by Layman Yingchuan while sitting with him. It was divided into fifteen ranks and could be considered in light of ancient and modern, domestic and foreign situations. It was very appropriate. I passed it on to colleagues, and they all said it was so. It is now written separately as follows:

Weiqi Fifteen Ranks, Division of Black and White and Number of Handicaps

Three Chess Seats

Chess Marshal: Play Even

Chess Supervisor: Gives First, then Plays Even

Chess General: Gives First

Three Academic Degrees

Chess Doctor: Gives Two, then Gives First

Chess Master: Gives Two, then Gives Two

Chess Bachelor: Gives Two

Nine Grades of Chess Players

First Grade Chess Player: Gives Two, Three, then Gives Two

Second Grade Chess Player: Gives Three, Two, then Gives Three

Third Grade Chess Player: Gives Three

Fourth Grade Chess Player: Gives Three, Four

Fifth Grade Chess Player: Gives Four

Sixth Grade Chess Player: Gives Four, Five

Seventh Grade Chess Player: Gives Five

Eighth Grade Chess Player: Gives Five, Six

Ninth Grade Chess Player: Gives Six

### The Divorce Record of Wu Suqiu (Part 2)

— Yizhi

When Wu Suqiu saw the reporter, she showed no emotional impulse. She said, "He Lin is too unmotivated. I can't suffer with him. He always has a cigarette in his mouth. Who knows when his voice will recover? How can this be?" "However, the reason for our separation is definitely not because I have a boyfriend or he has a girlfriend. Please don't misunderstand." Qiu'er explained.

The reporter saw Wang Helin, a handsome young man of twenty-two. No wonder Qiu'er once loved him. Aside from the fact that his "waist bag of money" was not as full as Mr. Ba's, in terms of appearance, he and Qiu'er were a real "perfect couple." He said, "I knew long ago that Wu Suqiu had other plans. Some time ago, when I asked her to take a commemorative photo with me when we went out for a walk, she refused. It's clear that she has no 'love' for me. Why should I force it? I don't hope for any 'reunion'. From now on, I'm going to work hard, form a troupe and perform soon. Let's see who succeeds and who fails in the future."

Wang Helin may have become more motivated.

### Wu Suqiu, the Broken Mirror Reunited

The Threads of Love are Hard to Sever: Suqiu Weeps Bitterly

The situation is somewhat bizarre. Wu and Wang's love had broken down, and the marriage certificate had been burned. However, on the morning of the day (the 19th) when their relationship was completely severed, Wu Suqiu suddenly went to Wang Helin's house with her sister. It just so happened that Wang Helin was not there. Qiu'er sat on Wang Helin's brass bed—the very place where, not long ago, they had been talking about love. Thinking about the future, she covered her face and wept bitterly. The Wang family did not know how to comfort her. In the end, they put her in a rickshaw and sent her back to the Wu family.

Does Qiu'er regret it? Has she been mistreated by some young master on the outside and thought about the good things about her former lover? Shanghai friends who like to gossip about Wu Ziqiu's love affairs, wait for the next chapter!

(Editor's Note) The situation of Wu Suqiu and Wang Helin's divorce has been described above. We have just learned that they were fortunate enough to have friends mediate between them. They reached a reconciliation agreement on the evening of September 23rd, and both parties have returned to good terms. This is indeed a pleasant surprise. We hope that this young pair of artists will from now on sing in harmony and diligently study the dramatic movement. This is the right thing to do.

Chapter 17: A Crown Rushed Off for a Beauty

Wu Sangui did not dare to neglect the imperial edict, so he immediately reorganized his troops into three armies, leaving Chai Yang to lead 20,000 troops to garrison Ningyuan. When the army marched into the pass, it was specified to depart at night in batches to prevent the Manchus from detecting and taking any action. He ordered his subordinate garrison commander Ma Bao to be the vanguard, and Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei to be assistants. Xu Jing and Liu Yinying were assigned to the right army under the command of Brigadier General Bai Xianzong. In early March, the army moved into the pass. At that time, the young Manchu emperor had just been established, and Prince Regent Dorgon was in full control of the government. He was consolidating the internal affairs and had no immediate ambition to encroach on the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, when Wu Sangui entered the pass, the Manchus did not initially receive any information and took no action. However, just as Wu Sangui's army had reached Fengrun County, a bolt from the blue suddenly struck. Bad news arrived: Li Zicheng had captured the capital, and Emperor Chongzhen and Eunuch Wang Chengen had hanged themselves on Wansui Mountain to die for their country. Wu Sangui was shocked and grieved by this ominous news. He regretted that the army had marched too slowly, so that he could not protect the capital and allow the wise ruler to die for the country, and could not save him in time. Moreover, his beloved concubine Chen Yuanyuan was also trapped in the besieged city, and he wondered if the beautiful woman could ultimately be safe and sound? This was what he was most concerned about. As a result, he immediately hesitated and temporarily stationed near Lishi Prefecture. On the one hand, he sent many spies to Beijing to gather information and then decide how to deal with Li Zicheng. Of course, the three armies under his command were all shaken. (182)

### "Family" Movie Story (6)

— Zhou Yibai

After Mingfeng's death, it was naturally a deep trauma in Juewei's heart. From then on, he gradually developed this resentment towards the entire family. At the same time, he also expressed doubts about the social system at the time. Although he did not immediately take decisive measures, his anxious and restless attitude was always revealed in his words and expressions. Juexin understood this very well, but there was no way to explain it to Juewei, because Juewei had never agreed with his philosophy of compromise.

The matter between Juewei and Mingfeng had just come to an end, but the marriage between Zhang Yunhua and Juemin had stirred up huge waves. First, Zhang Yunhua was studying at a certain girls' school when she met the son of the local warlord Commander Zhang. Impressed by her beauty, he asked Feng Leshan to act as an intermediary, preparing to use coercive means to forcibly marry Yunhua. At the same time, Old Master Gao thought that Juemin had reached marriageable age, so he betrothed him to Feng Leshan's granddaughter and set a date for the betrothal ceremony. Juemin and Yunhua were both facing this situation at the same time, and they usually cherished each other and had long been in love. When the day came, they agreed to escape together as a sign of resistance. Only Juewei participated in their plan.

When Old Master Gao learned of this, he was extremely angry and immediately ordered Juexin to bring Juemin back at all costs. Juexin knew that Juewei had participated in the matter and wanted to obtain Juemin's whereabouts from Juewei. Although Juewei admitted that he knew about the matter, he refused to reveal Juemin's hiding place. Just as the dispute was unresolved, a message suddenly came that Mei had died of illness. Juexin and Ruijue both felt very sad. Juexin naturally knew in his heart that half of Mei's death was because of him.
