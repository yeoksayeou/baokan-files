### US Secretary of State Makes Assurance: No Appeasement Policy Will Be Adopted; Contents of Hull-Hu Shih Meeting Not Announced; China Maintains Constant Trust in US Aid and Sympathy

United Press, Washington, 5th – Chinese Ambassador to the US, Dr. Hu Shih, met with Secretary of State Hull for 45 minutes yesterday. According to official sources, this was a "message exchange" meeting. The topics discussed were not announced, but Dr. Hu Shih paid close attention to all developments in the Far East issue. When reporters asked Ambassador Hu Shih whether this meeting further increased confidence in US aid to China, Hu Shih replied, "I express my constant trust in US aid and sympathy."

International News Service, Washington, 5th – Because Secretary of State Hull has assured Chinese Ambassador to the US, Dr. Hu Shih, that China need not worry about the current exploratory talks between the US and Japan, the slight fear China held regarding the possible trend of US-Japan talks in Washington has been swept away by this assurance. Hull and Ambassador Hu met at the State Department for 45 minutes. Ambassador Hu, besides pointing out that he had received the above assurance, declined to publicly discuss the matter further. Reliable sources claimed that the US government has frankly told Japan that if Japan wants to gain understanding on Pacific issues, it must abandon its Axis alliance and change its policy of territorial expansion. Whether Japan will improve relations with the United States or risk war with the United States in order to share the spoils of an Axis victory is currently being decided in Tokyo. Senior officials strongly stated that all attempts at appeasement of Japan have ended. It is also strongly claimed that if Japan wants to prove its credibility and goodwill, it must stop mistreating American nationals in the Far East. It is also said that Japan's abandonment of further aggression in the Far East is a prerequisite for US-Japan understanding. If Japan is willing to accept these demands, the US government may consider formally negotiating with Japan, including resolving the Sino-Japanese war. It is believed here that although China insists on recovering the Northeast, if Japan agrees to withdraw troops from other parts of China, China may allow Japan some special rights in the Northeast.

### US Will Help Chinese Army Realize Counteroffensive With Airplanes and Tanks

International News Service, Hong Kong, 5th – As the US military mission headed by General Magruder is about to come to China, qualified observers here generally believe that the US will provide military assistance to China with artillery, airplanes, and tanks, which will be realistically implemented in China's final counteroffensive. China will drive Japan out of China in this decisive counteroffensive. After four years of struggle, the Chinese army has been able to wage a protracted war, preventing Japan from invading again. However, it is generally believed that if the Chinese army cannot obtain the aid of airplanes, artillery, and tanks, it will not be able to implement a counteroffensive and give Japan a fatal blow. Observers believe that the United States is preparing to send these military supplies to China. General Magruder's mission is to investigate what kind of artillery, airplanes, and tanks China needs most, and to enable the Chinese to use these modern weapons, which requires technical experts to train them. US military experts in China all believe that most of the Chinese army are infantry, and their equipment, except for rifles, only includes field guns and machine guns. However, there are also some artillery brigades and mechanized divisions. They believe that to change the war situation, a general counteroffensive must be implemented. The equipment of the Japanese army stationed in China is mostly of the 1939 model. If the United States transports a large number of military supplies of the same year and last year to China, China's counteroffensive is quite possible. Although Japan is mobilizing more reserves in the country, it still lacks sufficient forces to meet the needs of the Chinese front and defend the Northeast and Vietnam. Furthermore, according to observers' explanation, the US mission to China is a warning to Japan's actions and a guarantee to China to continue its aid. They believe that what the United States is concerned about is maintaining the status quo in the Far East and uniting with Britain and the Soviet Union to defeat the Nazis. It is generally believed that after China receives strong US assistance, the Japanese army in China (accounting for nearly three-fifths of Japan's total military strength) can be withdrawn, and the threat of Japan's attack on Siberia and Vietnam will also be gone.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes Transportation Mobilization Plan

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th – Japanese sources say that the Cabinet today passed a transportation mobilization plan, the purpose of which is to place all transportation and communication systems on a complete wartime footing. Private use of transportation and communication systems will be greatly restricted. The government's procedures will increase the convenience of transporting important materials, and there will be a thorough reorganization of existing transportation organizations.

### US Army Department Will Request Appropriation of 10 Billion Dollars to Purchase Tanks, Anti-Tank Guns, and Anti-Aircraft Guns; US Airplane Production Increased Greatly Last Month

United Press, Washington, 5th – Secretary of War Patterson announced yesterday that the Army Department will soon submit a request to Congress for 10 billion US dollars to purchase tanks, anti-tank guns, and anti-aircraft guns. This new supplemental appropriation request from the Army will apparently be submitted together with President Roosevelt's second Lend-Lease request. It is understood that the amount of the second Lend-Lease bill will be between 50 billion and 70 billion US dollars. Members of the House Appropriations Committee said that this request will cause the committee to conduct a thorough investigation of the defense and Lend-Lease programs.

Havas, Washington, 4th – The Office of Production Management announced that in August, US aircraft factories manufactured a total of 1,854 aircraft, an increase of 394 from July, which can be said to have broken all records. How the aircraft manufactured last month were allocated, how many were shipped to Britain, and how many were supplied to the US Army and Navy were not mentioned.

### Thai Troops on Vietnamese Border Completely Withdrawn; First Japanese Ambassador Arrives in Thailand

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th – According to reports from Saigon, Thailand has notified the Japanese representative of the boundary demarcation committee that the Thai troops stationed in the area not to be garrisoned in the future on the Vietnamese border have now been completely withdrawn.

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th – Japanese sources in Bangkok say that the Bangkok Parliament has passed the second and third readings of the special emergency bill to mobilize all of Thailand's resources to defend the country. The parliament also passed an amendment to the criminal law stipulating the death penalty or life imprisonment for traitors, and a bill stipulating the responsibilities of the people in wartime.

Reuters, Bangkok, 5th – Japan's first ambassador to Thailand, Teiji Tsubogami, arrived here yesterday.

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th – Japanese sources in Bangkok said that Japan's first ambassador to Thailand, Teiji Tsubogami, said today at his first reception for reporters that the Japanese government's policy towards Thailand is to respect its independence and promote mutual prosperity, and pointed out the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries. He said that Japan will use actions as the backing of its policy in order to eliminate the malicious propaganda of countries intending to hinder Japan-Thailand relations. Tsubogami promised to do his best to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries, saying that these relations have recently become closer in administrative and economic terms, as evidenced by the mutual dispatch of ambassadors.

Editorial
— A Temporary Subsidiary Coin Panic

In the past month, it is not known for what reason, a phenomenon of inconvertibility of small notes and one-yuan bills has suddenly occurred in the market. Initially, those holding bills to exchange were unwilling to exchange, and those holding bills to buy goods were unwilling to give change. Later, it appeared on public transportation vehicles, where those holding bills to buy tickets were sometimes rejected, or those refusing to use one-yuan bills to pay the fare were driven off the bus, with various unreasonable actions against passengers. Since exchange is the business, and it is not absent from circulation in the market, to refuse small exchanges; then the bills received are not known what they are kept for. According to reports, there are about 40 million yuan of soft and hard subsidiary coins in the city. Suddenly, the circulation feels extremely lacking, and it is sincerely not known where it has flowed. Public transportation businesses with large daily income of subsidiary coins, and where those revenues are used is also unknown; if they are not used to provide change for passengers, could it be that they must be used for hoarding and manipulation; otherwise, how could the exchange of subsidiary coins, which has been abundant until now, suddenly have this tight and abnormal phenomenon. Some say that this is an annual manipulation, but what is the meaning of this? Leaving aside the fact that the end of last year is still far away, even if it is the end-of-year manipulation, what reasonable cause can be said. What is regrettable is that the currency was originally intended to benefit the people, but if the currency can be manipulated and hoarded by people, what system is left in the currency system? How can those responsible for maintaining and adjusting it face people? The citizens have suffered from subsidiary coins since the disappearance of copper coins, and it is not known how many times. It has only been stable in recent years, but now there is today's phenomenon. If there is hoarding, there should be distribution; if there is speculation, there should be stabilization. If this is the case, then even if you want to manipulate, you cannot get it. Looking at the name of maintenance, but not the reality of maintenance, wanting to exchange but not being able to, and not knowing where to exchange, then what is being maintained, and who is being exchanged for? This is only setting up barriers for oneself and disappointing the public's enthusiasm for trust!

However, to quell this small panic of subsidiary coins is not difficult, as long as what is hoarded is released! In fact, what is the use of hoarding such a large amount of subsidiary coins? Those who suffer are still the public! Because if there is a lack of small denomination notes, then two or three cents can be sold for five cents; if there is a lack of five-cent notes, then items worth five cents can be raised to one dime; if there is a lack of dime notes, then those worth two or three dimes can be sold for five dimes, and those worth six or seven dimes can be sold for one yuan, so that the commercial sector can take the opportunity to increase profits, and general daily life will be greatly affected. Therefore, manipulating subsidiary coins only causes resentment among the public and has not been seen to have any benefit. Now that subsidiary coins are felt to be insufficient, efforts should be made to make up for their inadequacy. If there is no maintenance, it is no different from voluntarily giving up. Moreover, maintenance should not be just empty words, and exchange should not be limited to the same industry. The most fair and appropriate method is to give the majority of users the opportunity for direct exchange. In this era of hoarding of all goods, as long as it passes through someone's hands, it can be used as a tool to achieve its speculative plans and pursue a profit of one-tenth. If the issuance of currency is endless, then those who hoard will lose their ability to use it and will not want to hoard it! How can one know that they will not also release what they originally hoarded? To make subsidiary coins return to normal, only public transportation businesses and financial exchange businesses can avoid conspiring in secret, avoid fueling the flames, avoid profiting from this, and avoid hoarding and releasing. The public also does not need to hoard as a skill, and do not think too much about the amount. This is only a temporary phenomenon. If you treat it calmly and accept it as usual without panic, it will disappear in an instant. At most, it is only adding one more kind of currency! However, there are too many transactions involving subsidiary coins, and paper money is easily damaged. The aluminum coins issued before were the most suitable: but recently, like other hard coins, they have also been purchased by people raising the price of the coin material, and circulation has suddenly decreased. Now, in order to meet the actual needs, five-cent aluminum coins can be remanufactured to circulate, and their form should be the same as today's five-cent and one-cent coins. Because the quality is light, it can be easily destroyed, and the cost is low, which is conducive to manufacturing, just to facilitate transactions, and prevent counterfeiting. Given the current high cost of printing paper and its ease of damage, this is also a good way to remedy the situation.

### First US Tanker Safely Arrives at Vladivostok Port; Close Attention Being Paid to Germany's Reaction to Japan

United Press, Los Angeles, 5th – The Union Oil Company announced yesterday that the tanker "Sankey Claire" has safely arrived in Vladivostok, carrying 95,000 barrels of aviation gasoline. This is the first batch of oil shipments in the US aid to the Soviet Union program. The date of the "Sankey Claire's" arrival in Vladivostok was not disclosed by the shipping department and will be announced 12 hours later. Two other tankers will arrive in Vladivostok in succession on Monday and Tuesday, one carrying 9,500 barrels of isopentane (chemical name) fuel and one carrying 75,000 barrels. The "Sankey Claire" left San Francisco on August 15.

International News Service, Washington, 5th – According to news received by the State Department from the US Consulate in Vladivostok, the first US tanker carrying gasoline to the Soviet Union has arrived in Vladivostok without incident. Although Japanese newspapers have repeatedly threatened, Japan has not tried to stop US ships. It is believed here that this is a sign that Japan wants to avoid new disputes with the United States.

Havas, Washington, 4th – After the first US tanker carrying oil safely arrived in Vladivostok, diplomatic circles here expressed satisfaction and believe that this is a preliminary result of US-Japan talks. What achievements have been made on the topics discussed in the US-Japan negotiations cannot be commented on at this moment, but the fact that the United States has applied economic pressure to Japan has already been effective, as can be proven by this fact. Japanese radicals originally advocated taking a tough stance against the United States, but now Japan's attitude is very different. Japan is acting this way probably due to being forced by facts. If it were not, then the partial stagnation of industrial production and even the loss of the US market for export trade would be unavoidable. As for the United States, although it is currently negotiating with Japan, it still adheres to the principles of the United States' traditional diplomatic policy. In other words, it insists on maintaining the status quo in the Far East. Based on this, the future US-Japan relations will obviously depend on whether Japan can break away from the Axis and abandon its imperialist ambitions in the Pacific. Therefore, it is impossible to say that the United States will sacrifice the interests of China or any country in the Far East (including the Soviet Union) in order to reach a compromise with Japan. In short, the United States will continue to conduct diplomatic negotiations with Japan. If President Roosevelt's efforts cannot prompt Japan to reflect and avoid participating in the European war, then American public opinion will fully support any measures the President should take in the future. Observing from both domestic and foreign policy perspectives, this US-Japan negotiation is seen as likely to achieve good results. Japan's non-interference in the United States' continuous supply to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok is probably one aspect of this result.

United Press, Tokyo, 5th – The Cabinet Information Bureau announced today that a tanker carrying US warplane gasoline to the Soviet Union has arrived in Vladivostok. Japan has not received official notification. Washington and Los Angeles have both officially announced that the first tanker has arrived in Vladivostok. The Information Bureau said that negotiations regarding Japan's protest of this shipment are "still in progress," thus sweeping away the rumor that an understanding has been reached. The rumor said that Japan, under this understanding, would allow US oil and war supplies to go to Vladivostok without interference.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th – People here have not commented on the report of the safe arrival of US oil shipments in Vladivostok, but will pay close attention to the Japanese government's reaction.

Reuters, Seattle, 5th – One of the two Soviet flying boats, carrying a Soviet military mission, has flown from Sitka, Alaska, to the Sand Point Naval Station. The second one will arrive soon.

### If Japan Does Not Change Its Policy, It Will Be Difficult to Save Its Incurable Disease; Cabinet Actions Are Still Extremely Frantic

The US Is Willing to Fight Even If It Is Forced Too Much

Reuters, Washington, 5th – Observers here agree with Japanese Prime Minister Konoe this time, that is, they all believe that Japan is currently in the most serious crisis in its history. Since Japan joined the Axis and began preparing for war against the United States, informed people have held this view. However, it is surprising that Tokyo did not realize the severity of the crisis it created until today. The New York Times said that Japan is isolated in the Far East, its allies have failed to provide assistance, its trade has been wiped out, its army is mired in a quagmire, and the encirclement it has long been worried about is gradually becoming a reality, because its aggressive strategy has forced China, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and the United States to establish a common policy of armed resistance. Konoe's statement that the situation is extremely serious is certainly not an overestimate. Hitler is unable to cope with the war against the Soviet Union and cannot attack Britain, while China's resistance is still strong, Singapore's defense is becoming increasingly strong, the Dutch East Indies have more complete armaments than before, and the United States has abandoned its policy of buying peace with oil. All of these are a great disappointment to Japan. Konoe's saying that only complete mobilization can enable Japan to tide over the difficulties is still just a case of changing the soup but not the medicine, and it cannot cure the incurable disease. In fact, Japan's true interests lie not in this, but in reconciliation with China and changing its foreign policy, abandoning the Axis and joining Britain and the United States. However, do not say that we can be induced to adopt a policy of appeasement or betray our Chinese friends. The above discussion in the New York Times clearly represents the general sentiment here. There are rumors that Japan is willing to resolve all differences with the United States, but people here mostly do not believe that Japan has this sincerity, and believe that Japan aims to delay. However, even if Japan wants to delay to wait for an opportunity, it will be useless, because the Axis's dream of a quick victory in the Soviet Union is now moving further and further away from reality. Konoe wants to meet with the US President at sea, but this claim has been destroyed by the recent hostile remarks of Japanese military spokesmen and newspapers. These remarks cannot help Ambassador Nomura's talks with the White House and the State Department. Even with Nomura's talks, they cannot be said to be negotiations. Even if Nomura has some success, Colonel Mabuchi's remarks have wiped out this success. The Japanese are still criticizing the US, so does Konoe's private letter to the US President only represent himself? Or does it aim to delay time? But no matter which is the case, it will not help US-Japan relations. Some people here say that Japan's actions have made Hitler anxious, so a certain newspaper published a cartoon depicting Hitler holding a bundle of war news from the Soviet Union and shouting to the rising sun from Asia with a cold expression, "Brother, put some energy into it."

United Press, Tokyo, 5th – Yesterday, the Cabinet's actions continued to be extremely frantic. At the same time, newspapers continued to warn the United States that unless the United States accepts Japan's policy of controlling East Asia, there is no hope for peace in the Pacific. Minister Without Portfolio Yanagawa met with Prime Minister Konoe, which Domei News Agency called an extremely important meeting. The Teito Shimbun said that President Roosevelt did not mention Japanese actions in his Labor Day speech, so it is difficult to harmonize US-Japan relations. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that Japanese diplomatic circles are urging the United States to reconsider its policy and should maintain peace in the Pacific in the "last minute." The newspaper also said that Japan is trying to achieve a satisfactory resolution to the war in China, but then warned that Japan will also pay close attention to Britain's actions in Afghanistan, because Afghanistan is a country in Asia, located just outside the East Asian "Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Haitong News Agency, New York, 5th – According to "US News," the conditions proposed by the United States to Japan are (1) to end the Sino-Japanese war, (2) to return the military ports in Vietnam, (3) to withdraw from the Tripartite Pact, and (4) to express non-cooperation with the United States. The United States will (1) abolish economic sanctions, (2) provide loans to Japan, and (3) supply Japan with certain raw materials.

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th – Acting spokesman of the Information Bureau, Iwai Akira, replied to newspaper reporters this morning that Japan does not accept the mediation of one or several countries regarding the resolution of the China Incident. This determination has not changed.

Reuters, New York, 5th – The New York Times said that the United States does not want to go to war with Japan. Although it is unwilling to lightly expend the sharp weapons it intends to use on the important battlefields across the Atlantic, if Japan forces it too much, the United States is willing to fight it.

### US Is Engaged in a "Serious Undertaking," Says Mrs. Roosevelt

United Press, Pittsburgh, 5th – Mrs. Roosevelt said yesterday when meeting with the press that the American people are not yet aware that the conflict in Europe has plunged the country into a very dangerous situation, and said that the United States is engaged in a "serious undertaking."

### Italian 20,000-Ton Mail Ship Sinks After Being Hit by a Mine

Reuters, London, 5th – The Admiralty issued the following communiqué: A large Italian mail ship heading south was torpedoed by a British submarine near the Italian coast and its sinking is almost certain. This mail ship is probably the 23,636-ton "Doria." It is understood that such large mail ships have been converted by the Italian side into troop transports.

### India Practicing Air Defense

Reuters, Lahore, 5th – A military spokesman said today that the largest air defense exercise in India's history will be held in the Panjab region of the Northwest Frontier from October 5 to 14.

Within less than ten days, they were defeated and retreated. Much of their ammunition and military supplies, etc., could not be moved away. When the Chinese army approached Fuzhou and Lianjiang in the morning, a fire broke out in the city. The Chinese army entered the city, chasing and attacking while putting out the fire. The organs, houses, and Nantai commercial area, Zhongting Road, Yusu Road and surrounding areas in Fuzhou City occupied by the Japanese were mostly burned down (4th telegram).

Fuzhou – After the Chinese army in the war zone recovered Fuzhou, they continued to pursue and advance towards Mawei, searching for the defeated Japanese.

### One Week of Battle Situation, August 29th to September 4th

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that there were two notable aspects of the past week's battle situation: "The offensive by our army on the Eastern Front" and "The Battle of Nie Jiahe in Central Hubei." Both achieved significant results. The Eastern Front was the larger of the two. The recovery of Fuzhou was part of it. Other minor battles in Southern Shanxi and Northern Henan are less important and will not be described in detail. As for the shooting down of a Japanese plane in Lanzhou on August 31st and the unusual movements of Japanese troops in Guangzhou last week, these were insignificant events that occurred during small-scale battles this week. The two battle situations are described below:

Offensive of Chinese Army on Eastern Front

(1) The field armies in various regions including eastern Fujian, northern Jiangxi, northern Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, and southern Anhui launched small-scale offensives against the Japanese in their respective areas on the 25th and 26th. (2) The offensive situation in each direction is as follows: (1) One force attacking Fuqing recovered the city on the 1st. The Japanese retreated towards the port. The Chinese have already pursued them past Bailuting. On the 2nd, the Japanese reinforced with over 1,000 troops and retook Fuqing. The Chinese then launched a fierce attack, and finally recovered it again on the 3rd of this month. (2) One force attacking Lianjiang captured Maoshan on the 25th and attacked the suburbs of the city. They captured the city on the 3rd. (3) One force attacking the outer strongholds of Fuzhou repeatedly approached the port. On the evening of the 2nd, they captured the port. The Japanese in Fuzhou, hearing the news, boarded warships and retreated on the morning of the 3rd. (4) One force attacking Yuyao engaged the Japanese in fierce fighting south of the city on the 25th. (5) One force attacking Nanmiao and Baiguan captured the town of Baiguan on the 25th and then fought the Japanese at the eastern end of the town. After being punished, the Japanese took on new tasks. (6) One force attacking Shaoxing, on the 25th, a portion of the troops attacked the southwestern suburbs of the city, another portion captured Keqiao Town in the northwest, and another portion captured Dongguan Town in the east of the county. The Japanese were already showing signs of weakness and were retreating. On the 26th, the portion that captured Keqiao re-captured Keshan to the south. (7) One force attacking Xiaoshan was engaged in fierce fighting on the 25th at Shijia Mountain, Huzhao Mountain in the south of the city, and Turtle Mountain in the east of the city. (8) One force attacking Fuyang entered the city on the 25th and engaged in fierce street fighting. When other Japanese troops came to reinforce, they turned to intercept those Japanese troops. (9) One force attacking Yuhang also entered the city on the 15th and then turned to attack its outer strongholds, Phoenix Mountain south of the city, at dawn the next day. (10) One force attacking Wukang also entered the city on the 25th, killing many Japanese and seizing a large amount of booty. They also destroyed the Japanese agencies and fortifications in the city and suburbs before returning. On the 2nd, over 1,000 Japanese troops came from Hangzhou to attack Pailou Town to the west. (11) One force attacking Wuxing occupied Wufeng Mountain west of the city, another force captured Jiapu and Hougang Village east of the city, and another force entered Beiguan Village, seizing a great amount of booty. The Japanese who suddenly attacked Linchengqiao were also repelled by the Chinese. Kanshi then reinforced with over 1,000 troops and attacked Meixi Town again. On the 2nd, they joined with the Japanese who came from Wuxing to harass Qiankengqiao. (12) One force attacking Gaochun captured it in one fell swoop on the 25th. They are currently confronting the Japanese east of the city at the Confucius Temple. (13) One force attacking Wanzhi had already reached the vicinity of Jiuli Mountain, Honghuapu, and Xizhen on the 25th. On the 28th, over 1,000 Japanese reinforcements counterattacked unsuccessfully. On the evening of the 1st, the Chinese army captured Xinhezhuang southeast of Wuhu. (14) One force attacking Gongchi destroyed the fortifications in the Xiziling area west of the city and returned.

### Deputy Head of the Visiting Burma Delegation, Zeng Yangfu, Delivers Speech in Rangoon, Analyzing Economic Value of Yunnan-Burma Railway; Delegation Bids Farewell to Governor of Burma, Heads to Mandalay

Rangoon: Zeng Yangfu, deputy head of the Chinese Visiting Burma Delegation, delivered a speech at the Rotary Club last night at 6:30 PM, predicting that after the completion of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, it will have unlimited economic value and become the most important railway line on the Asian continent. Not only will it connect Burma with southwestern China, but it will also link Malaya, India, and central, northern, and northwestern China. After the end of the war, Chinese trade will still be extremely important because the development of southwestern China is permanent. The cost of transporting Chinese goods via the Yunnan-Burma Railway is lower and the time is more economical. After the war, the road will still have economic value, and all concerns can be dispelled. The situation in Vietnam does not seem to be able to recover within [a unit of time]. Even after its recovery, I also believe that it cannot be a strong competitor to the Yunnan-Burma Railway. Zeng then addressed the rumors that the completion of the road would pose a danger to Burma (especially the rumors that our country would immigrate to Burma), dismissing them as unfounded and explaining that first, Yunnan itself lacks labor; and second, among those in the Chinese business and government workforce who have immigrated to Burma in the past five years, at least 50 or 60 percent are not permanent residents. Zeng concluded by saying that the Yunnan-Burma Railway will help us win and help Burma become strong. (4th dispatch)

Rangoon: The Chinese Visiting Burma Delegation has been extremely well received here for several days. Officials are prepared to cooperate with China. At the Governor's banquet on the second, he also delivered a speech, saying, "I am certain that the Chinese diplomatic representative stationed in Burma can prove that the government and people of Burma consider any needs of China with the greatest sympathy. On our part, we firmly believe that any assistance required from China, whether during or after the war, China will certainly provide to us as quickly as possible." The Governor also presented the delegation with a set of Burmese classical music records. According to a letter to the delegation's head, Jiang Menglin, "I wish to offer this gift as a permanent example of the goodwill of the people of Burma towards the people of China." Since the first, the delegation has been constantly invited to banquets. The Mayor of Rangoon also hosted a banquet for the delegation. The delegation bid farewell to the Governor on the 4th and was scheduled to be hosted by the staff of our government stationed in Burma at 1:30 PM on the 4th. They were originally scheduled to take a train to Mandalay on the evening of the 4th, but this has been postponed to the 5th. (4th dispatch)

Chongqing: Ye Yuanlong, the president of Chongqing University, a provincial university in Sichuan Province, resigned, and Liang Yingjing was appointed as his successor. The students of the university then engaged in a refusal-to-accept-new-president movement. After the authorities patiently explained the matter, they claimed to repent and expressed their obedience. However, before President Liang had been in office for a week, they again took the opportunity to insult the newly appointed Chief of General Affairs, Li, and escalated to the point of assaulting and expelling the president. The Ministry of Education, believing that the students of the university had repeatedly failed to reform after warnings and had violated the law, issued an order on the 5th to dissolve the university and punish the instigators and trouble-making students, and to send personnel to manage it.

### Soviet Union Concentrates Large Army to Defend Leningrad with All Its Strength; Advancing German Troops Have Not Gained Solid Positions; Red Army on Central Front Launches Broad Counteroffensive

International News Agency, London, 5th dispatch: The "Daily Mail" reports from Moscow that the Soviet Union is taking severe measures to defend Leningrad. Stalin has ordered that the defense of Leningrad be managed by a six-person committee, chaired by Marshal Voroshilov. Voroshilov is currently devoting all his efforts to resisting the German army.

Reuters, London, 5th dispatch: The German High Command announced that the Eastern Front battles continue to be victorious and that the encirclement of Leningrad is in progress. The city is already within range of heavy artillery. Moscow, however, stated that the Soviet army has crushed a German infantry division, with over 7,000 casualties. It is reported that the German army also planned to build a pontoon bridge over the Dnieper River to cross it, but was repelled by the Soviet army. Currently, there are continuing major battles around Leningrad and Odessa. The German side claims that it may not directly attack the aforementioned two cities to avoid unnecessary losses. The head of the Soviet Information Bureau, Lozovsky, denied the German report that Leningrad has been isolated, stating that there are still several railways connecting the city with the rest of the Soviet army. The troops under General Voroshilov are currently fiercely fighting at various key points in Leningrad, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented. The German army has joined the battle with a large number of land and air forces, while the Soviet army is firmly defending without retreating. The situation in the Odessa area has improved, and the Soviet army has the possibility of a counteroffensive. Berlin radio acknowledged that the German positions east of Smolensk were attacked three times yesterday.

According to a Reuters correspondent, who telephoned from Leningrad, there are extremely fierce battles on many fronts. The Germans have been working hard to consolidate their positions, so as to continue their offensive from them, but the constant counterattacks of the Soviet army have given them no opportunity to stabilize new positions.

Reuters, London, 5th dispatch: Although the German and Soviet communiques are secretive about the progress of the Eastern Front battles, they have not been able to conceal the fact that the war situation is taking concrete shape on three fronts. General Mannerheim of the Finnish army announced that "Finnish troops have reached the old border of the Karelian Isthmus." Whether Mannerheim's statement in his order that "the day of returning to the fields with our weapons put away has not yet arrived" means that the Finnish side will assist Germany in continuing the war, or only defend its recovered lost territory, will soon be known. The great battle for Leningrad is currently underway. The German side has mobilized a large army and hundreds of aircraft to fiercely attack the outer defense lines of the city, but so far it seems that it has not been able to shake the massive military power that General Voroshilov has concentrated in Leningrad to defend the land and the sky. It is generally believed that the Soviet army's attack on the protruding point of the enemy army in a certain area on the front line, which forced the German army back thirty miles and recovered twenty-two villages, may be the same Soviet counteroffensive that General MacFarlane, the head of the British military mission, witnessed northeast of Smolensk. The battle was indeed fierce, but in terms of scale, it was not a counteroffensive to protect the protruding point of the Soviet army in Kiev. As for the battle situation in Kiev, London is awaiting detailed reports.

Reuters, Stockholm, 5th dispatch: The "Svenska Dagbladet" of this city quoted an unconfirmed dispatch from Berlin yesterday, claiming that German troops led by General Leeb have made contact with the Soviet defense lines southwest of Leningrad, at distances of ten to twelve miles from the city. This defense line consists of fortresses left over from the civil war in 1919, supplemented and strengthened. The German side considers these fortresses to be a major obstacle. To capture them, a large force of aircraft must be used to attack. The German side wants to save Leningrad from the horrors of war, so the city has not yet been subjected to dive-bombing in this area. However, it is reported that the German army is currently attacking the Leningrad defense lines and the Kronstadt naval base that protects the city, taking advantage of favorable weather. The Soviet army is launching a broad counteroffensive in the central part of the battle line, along the line from Vyazma (midway between Smolensk and Moscow) to the south.

Soviet Spokesman Reports on the Battle Situation, Refutes Nazi Victory Propaganda

Reuters, Moscow, 5th dispatch: Soviet spokesman Lozovsky yesterday mocked the German radio's claims of occupying Belinsky, saying that this was a "victory on the radio." Belinsky is located on the banks of the Desna River, approximately 150 miles southeast of Smolensk and northeast of Gomel. When a Reuters correspondent asked if the German army had made further attempts to build pontoon bridges to forcibly cross the Dnieper River, as mentioned in the previous Soviet communique, Lozovsky replied that the German army had repeatedly made such attempts, all of which had failed. He also said that the German army was still far from advancing into Leningrad and had to rush reinforcements to maintain its positions. A month ago, the German side already claimed to have advanced to the suburbs of Leningrad, but this was later proven to be a figment of Goebbels' imagination. Currently, the fighting near Leningrad, between the city and Novgorod, is continuous and quite fierce. The German army has suffered heavy losses and has not made any progress. Moreover, it fears losing the territory it has already occupied, so it has repeatedly mobilized fresh troops for reinforcement. The German claims that Leningrad has been cut off from communication or surrounded are merely German propaganda and speculation. In reality, the transportation and railway lines between Leningrad and other parts of the Soviet Union are all open. The Soviet troops under General Voroshilov are fighting fiercely for every inch of land far from the city. Moreover, the defenses of Leningrad are excellent, and it has not yet been seriously attacked. German planes have attempted to attack the city several times, but have all failed. The spokesman also said that although the German side has been spreading absurd news, in reality, not a single Soviet ship in the Baltic Sea has been sunk. To the best of his knowledge, the German army has failed in its attempts to build pontoon bridges to forcibly cross the Dnieper River. The front line is about 2,000 miles long, so minor battles cannot be reported one by one. Only the most important battles can be described. The Soviet garrison in Odessa has inflicted heavy damage on the German and Romanian armies, resulting in a more stable situation on the city's perimeter. The number of casualties suffered by the Romanian army in the fierce battles is probably unmatched by any other battle.

Red Army Counterattacks in the Odessa Area; Germans Withdraw from the Pokrovka Heights

United Press, Moscow, 5th dispatch: An intelligence bulletin stated that the Soviet troops, who launched a terrible attack in Pokrovka (75 miles from Odessa), have driven the German 263rd Infantry Division out of the Pokrovka Heights. In the fighting on the 6th, they killed or wounded 6,000 Nazis and recovered countless villages. The bulletin also revealed that the great success in Pokrovka was the result of close cooperation between the artillery and infantry. The German forces in the Pokrovka area have been crushed.

Red Army Lands in Petsamo; Vyborg Turns into Scorched Earth

International News Agency, London, 5th dispatch: The "Daily Express" reported today that the Soviet Northern Arctic Light Fleet carried thousands of Red Army soldiers and landed in Petsamo, harassing the German rear. It is reported that they have destroyed several German fuel, food, and ammunition depots and are currently fighting the German forces in the area.

Havas, Vyborg, 4th dispatch: After Dutch troops occupied Vyborg, a Havas correspondent recently toured the area for a week. Due to the Red Army's scorched earth policy, they set fire to the entire city when they withdrew. All buildings were reduced to ashes, with not a single one spared. The broken walls and ruins are a shocking sight. The Finnish government authorities have already drawn up a plan to revitalize the city and have sent a large number of workers to clear the rubble. It will not be possible to complete this work in less than three weeks. During the clearing period, people are not allowed to enter the city.

### American Ship on Route to Iceland Attacked by Submarine; Nationality Unknown, Depth Charges Dropped; Washington Remains Silent, Awaiting Detailed Report

United Press International, Washington, 5th: The Navy Department officially announced yesterday that the American destroyer USS Greer was attacked by a submarine of unknown nationality with torpedoes in the North Atlantic yesterday morning. The American ship immediately retaliated with depth charges. The "Greer" was carrying mail to Iceland when it immediately sent a report from the ship stating, "This morning, a submarine attacked with torpedoes, but missed the target." The State Department and the White House did not immediately comment on this news from the Navy Department. The "Greer's" message was sent to the Navy Department's press office after 6:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. The White House and other important government departments quickly received the report. The "Greer" incident is the first attack on an American warship since the outbreak of the European war.

Reuters, Washington, 5th: Senator George of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee commented on the bombing of the American destroyer "Greer" by a submarine, saying that if this happened on the high seas, it would draw the United States into war. Senator Van Nuys said, "I believe this single incident is not enough to draw us into war, but if we stand firm, something will eventually happen." When officials were questioned about this matter, they could not say whether this happened inside or outside our territorial waters. However, a veteran submarine officer said that it is impossible to see the trajectory of a torpedo at night. The authorities' announcement did not mention the location or time of the incident, nor did it mention whether the nationality of the submarine had been determined. The "Greer" was launched in 1918, weighs 1,090 tons, and has a crew of 122. American warships sailing to Iceland now all adhere to wartime conditions, with all lights turned off and equipped with submarine detection devices. This matter was immediately reported to the President. According to a New York Times correspondent in Washington, it is generally believed that the submarine belongs to Germany.

Havas, New York, 5th: Local newspapers have just received news from Berlin that the German authorities, especially the Navy Department, have heard nothing about the attack on an American destroyer by a submarine in the Atlantic Ocean.

### US Promises to Supply War Materials to Polish Army

Reuters, Washington, 5th: White House sources say that on the President's instruction, American machine guns, rifles, cannons, and trucks will be transported to the Polish army currently training in Canada for deployment in Europe. This move by the President is a continuation of the US policy of aiding resistance against aggression.

### German Army Devises Many Schemes, Adopts Psychological Warfare Tactics, Gong and Drum Sounds Ineffective Against Enemy

TASS, 5th, Battlefield Report:

Two battalions of German soldiers attempted to attack with the sound of gongs and drums, but were eventually annihilated by the Red Army. The sound of gongs and drums was also broken through by the Red Army's machine guns.

The air-raid shelters are also equipped with running water, sanitary facilities, and radios. The housing committee is also arranging special air-raid shelters with beds and stoves.

### Bulgaria Unwilling to Target Soviet Union

Reuters, Ankara, 5th: It is reported that the Bulgarian government has notified Germany that Bulgaria will not wage war against the Soviet Union or send troops to the Soviet front. It is also said that the Bulgarian people's traditional friendship with the Soviet Union does not allow Bulgaria to take any action against the Soviet Union. However, in other situations, Bulgaria is willing to be Germany's ally.

### Yarn Flowers Wavering, Yarn Market Advances and Retreats, Most Speculators Equalize Positions on the Same Day

The yarn market has re-entered a wavering path, trending soft with a hard edge, but actual transactions are more active than before. Hong Kong dollars are used to directly purchase 300 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn from the factory at a price of $1,700. Other purchases of miscellaneous brand yarns also amount to one or two hundred bales, with firm prices. However, the prices of 32-count and 42-count fine yarn have softened slightly. As for factory orders, because speculators' intentions are weak and overnight positions are reduced, all offers are mostly of a temporary speculative nature, equalizing positions on the same day. Therefore, the market's ups and downs feel stagnant. A large portion has turned to the competitive buying and selling market to gamble on gains and losses. Consequently, recent fluctuations in Double Horse factory orders are minor. The market price of 20-count Double Horse is $1,711, with a low of $1,701. In the afternoon, it initially traded at $1,705, then gradually improved to close at $1,710. The average market price was $1,712. The exchange yarn and cloth market was weak in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, resulting in a weaker performance than the previous day.

Double Horse opened in the morning with a still-dimmed momentum. The initial price was $1,705, shortly rising to $1,707-8. This trading back and forth lasted for quite some time. Afterward, news came that the exchange opening was rising, and people's sentiment improved accordingly. At the same time, Guangdong traders called for 500 bales of transactions, and the market turned upward slightly, rising to $1,711. However, there were few buyers on the table, and most were pessimistic. Unexpectedly, the exchange closing recouped losses, and the market was constrained by it, tracking down to $1,701. The closing price was $1,703. Statistics for transactions during the half-day totaled 6,985 bales. The quantities bought by each group are listed as follows:

Hong Kong 485, Peers 6,500, Total 6,985

The situation in the Golden Change Horse futures market was slightly turbulent, remaining unresolved in its spiral. Few groups entered or exited, and the market appeared dull. The morning opening was barely affected by the strength of American cotton, and it failed to affect the intentions of various parties. Moreover, factories importing American cotton with foreign exchange greatly reduced the cost of fine yarn, and coarse yarn factory orders were therefore also stagnant. Therefore, the fluctuations in futures yarn were also small. The September contract opened at $1,618, slightly better by $1. The October contract was $1,645, also up $2. November was $1,659, only rising 5 jiao. Later, when the exchange suddenly reported a decline, speculators took advantage of it, and selling pressure intensified for a time. The September contract once fell to $1,610, the October contract fell to $1,636, and the November contract fell to $1,655. Therefore, the afternoon closing was close to the opening price, with near-term contracts each down $5 and far-term contracts down about $1. The turnover in the morning market was 5,310 bales. In the afternoon, there were slight changes, with rumors of positive news. The exchange gradually rose, and factory orders and futures yarn rebounded under the purchase of retail investors. As a result, the September contract closed at a high price of $1,620, still up $3. The October contract was $1,644.5, up $1.5. The November contract was $1,665, closing at a high price, up $6.5. The total turnover for the day was 9,270 bales, a decrease of 410 bales compared to the previous day. As of the evening of the 4th, the three-month account balance was 22,760 bales, including 6,720 bales for the September contract, 8,830 bales for the October contract, and 7,210 bales for the November contract. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the day are recorded on the left (net prices).

### Foreign Cotton Market Unprecedented; American Cotton Liners Shipped Directly to Shanghai

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade continues to see enthusiastic buying interest from all parties, and the market has reached unprecedented heights. Because the price of fixed-price sales has been much cheaper than spot cotton for days, and because the October foreign cotton arriving in Shanghai, which can be sold by various foreign cotton firms, will be shipped soon, both Chinese and foreign cotton mills and flower firms are making great efforts to order in a state of fierce competition. However, the number of foreign ships coming directly to Shanghai from the United States is quite small, and most will be transferred in Hong Kong, which is time-consuming and not welcomed by the public. Since yesterday, it has been heard that two or three cotton firms have leased American ships directly to Shanghai. What can be sold is undoubtedly fine lint raw materials such as Brazilian cotton and California cotton. This will undoubtedly arouse the active buying intentions of all parties. In total, yesterday's transaction volume of Brazilian cotton and American California cotton probably exceeded 2,000 bales.

The New York cotton market was volatile, rising due to buying by peers and short covering, and falling due to hesitation about the next Washington political report and Southern hedge buying. As a result, closing prices were up four or five points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was closed yesterday for a bank holiday. It is predicted that the opening situation today will be slightly lower by about 5 rupees compared to yesterday.

The spot cotton situation has been softening recently because the source of Indian cotton is unimpeded, and most can still be purchased, and the price in Shanghai has risen sharply. In addition, the yarn market is also weak, so the cotton market has followed suit.

### Grain, Small Squeezed Rice Price Not Far from 100 Yuan, 10,000 Bags Newly Arrived

Yesterday's investigation of the inventory of foreign rice added another 54,000+ bags, with various godowns reaching 1,244,258 bags. In addition, there are a number of uncounted bags. The abundant arrival and unified pricing is in fact unfavorable to the bulls, and the market saw another decline. Small squeezed rice opened at $107-8 in the morning, and the noon closing reached $105. No. 1 rice was $122. Selling pressure was even stronger in the afternoon, and it was rumored that the public sale price would have to be lowered. In addition, there were reports of Wuhu Xian rice pouring in and new tip rice hitting the market. Major players had returned with many short positions, and the market plummeted by as much as three yuan compared to the previous day. The closing price for No. 1 Saigon was only $120, the general market was $118, the middle passage was $116, and No. 2 Siamese was $105 to $101. Min Dang Special was $115, the general market was $118 to $114, and the next grade was $110 to $108.5. Bank godown small squeezed rice initially went from $108.5, then to $106. External godowns went from $107, then only $105. Broken tip high went from $82 to $78, then $78.

Thick and thin japonica rice, because foreign rice is in decline, if the Chinese goods have fallen near the $100 mark, although the situation of domestic and foreign rice is vastly different, the price is too far apart to be standardized, inevitably causing some constraint. Therefore, yesterday's arrivals were limited, and the market was still difficult to maintain. The price of both japonica rice continued to fall by two or three yuan in the environment of sluggish sales. The opening price of early rice in South Hong Kong was $154, falling to $152.5. Wuxi Special Japonica was $152, the general market was $148, Zhongsu was $146, and Pudong new japonica rice was also the same, depreciating and selling along with it, only opening at $156, $155.5.

Glutinous rice also moved with the market, presenting a light image. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened high from $124, falling to $118, special $126, green glutinous rice $110, $108, special $111-2, followed by a drop of one or two yuan.

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The large-scale arrival of foreign rice in port has been reported many times in this newspaper. Now it is known that the Taikoo Company's Taiyuan wheel imported yesterday morning, also bringing a large amount of foreign rice from Hong Kong, with 9,994 bags of foreign rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council at a low price and 990 bags of Saigon foreign rice transferred from Hong Kong, totaling 10,984 bags, berthing at the Bund branch wharf in the French Concession to unload.

### Foreign Vermicelli Relayed Endlessly

Yesterday in the foreign vermicelli market, there were still relay groups embellishing the market. Speculators took the opportunity to absorb the supply, while those holding the goods, given that the situation in the Pacific Ocean was unsettled, and that more than 100,000 bags had been ordered at $28-9 last month but had not yet been finalized, also refused to sell cheaply. The market once recovered by 3-5 jiao. However, after the rise, the opportunity to profit was taken, and the market was suppressed by the decline in foreign rice and adverse rumors, and the market could not sustain the fall. As a result, there was only a difference of one or two jiao from the previous closing price. Yantai opened at $32.4.5, reaching $32.5.5, and closed at $32 in the afternoon. Jinlong East Godown reached $31.8.5 in the early market, and closed down to $31.2.5 in the afternoon. West Godown reached $31.3 in the morning, and closed at $30.078 in the afternoon. Bell Tower was $34.2.5, and Five Swallow was $33.6. American Vermicelli Five Swallow was $31.1.5. Turnover was 30,000 bags. Bran was settled, wheat arrives in small quantities every day, factories' interest is average, and the market is unchanged.

### Oil Cakes, Oil Market Bull and Bear Fight

Yesterday, bulls and bears fought fiercely in both rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil, and the market remained spinning without stopping. Ultimately, due to a major player switching from short to long, the market tended to rise slightly, generally rising about two yuan compared to the previous day. More than 5,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua Factory for September 1st delivery were traded, with an opening price of $189, a high of $190.05, a low of $186, and a closing price of $188.5.

Although the price fell, it was only four yuan, and the turnover was a few thousand taels.

However, the Class E market differs by more than $2, and it is the cheapest in the entire market. The Class D market is small, and because there are too few entries and exits, there are occasional sellers who often sell at any price. Yesterday, Yuancheng continued to search, and the absorption by Qia Tai in recent days is quite noteworthy. Yesterday morning, Yuancheng, Yitai, Hongda, and Runde bought in. Jiufeng and Shuntai also had needs. Xiexing Yuan made up for shorts slightly, and Lianyi, Tongshun, Dingkang, and Xie Kang sold out. Market prices only rose by three or four jiao.

### The Foreign Exchange for Essential Supplies Will Be Determined Temporarily by the Stabilization Board; the Prohibition of Imports Ordinance Has Flexibility, and the Stabilization Board Can Take Contingency Measures; Grain Transported to Shanghai is Approved for Foreign Exchange, But Only for Sale in the Concession Areas

The fourteen Allied banks in this port, holding special notes from the U.S. government, have recently continued to stop or restrict black market foreign exchange transactions with extreme caution, while awaiting the results of the Hong Kong meeting of the Stabilization Fund Committee and the orders issued regarding the management of the Shanghai foreign exchange market. The designated banks have taken this step because they feel that part of the solution to the foreign exchange problem in Shanghai is still unknown, and the decisions of the Stabilization Conference may be unpredictable. To be prudent, all banks without sufficient backing have stopped black market exchange, fearing that they will not be able to replenish from the Stabilization Board in the future. Those with backing have limited black market transactions to avoid excessive risk. The Stabilization Conference is proceeding smoothly, and once the U.S. representatives Fox and Taylor and the two foreign bank representatives from Shanghai, Hawkins and Mackay, have consulted, the detailed policies for foreign exchange management will be announced and put into practice.

Flexibility in Foreign Exchange Settlement Methods

Regarding the method of settling foreign exchange for essential goods, there is an important principle: although it is fundamentally based on the Prohibition of Imports Ordinance promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and the Approval of Imports Ordinance decided by the Executive Yuan, the main decision-making power still rests with the Stabilization Board. In other words, the Stabilization Fund has the authority to decide whether an imported item is essential and whether foreign exchange should be settled for it. This temporary approval method is quite flexible and can respond to any sudden event to protect legitimate import trade that is deemed legal. Currently, import trade has stagnated somewhat. It is hoped that once the implementation of the foreign exchange settlement method becomes habitual and normal, it will be revived.

Foreign Exchange Supply Limited to Sales in Concessions

The Stabilization Fund Committee will approve and supply foreign exchange. All import merchants can request foreign exchange in accordance with the law for imported goods deemed as essential. Regarding the small broken rice and Min Dang rice transported from Yangon (Rangoon) to Shanghai, as well as the rice, wheat, and flour transported from the United States, it has been approved to supply foreign exchange based on the exchange rate quoted by HSBC (Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation). It is heard that the essential goods supplied with foreign exchange are limited to sale in the Shanghai concession areas and are absolutely prohibited from being re-transported to other ports after arriving in Shanghai. The applicant must provide a reliable guarantee. As for the Yangon rice ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the rice handled by the Public Warehouse Committee, foreign exchange will be supplied, but prior approval must be requested in accordance with the law.

Revised Methods More Strict Than Before

The revised measures for the prohibition of import goods during extraordinary times and the measures for cracking down on the sale of prohibited import goods, as well as the measures for the settlement and reporting of foreign exchange for export goods requiring foreign exchange, promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on September 1st, have been received by the Shanghai Customs and the Central Bank one after another. However, the original text of the measures and the list of prohibited goods have been sent from Chongqing (Chungking) to Shanghai and will be published as soon as they are received so that everyone can be informed. A reporter from New Voice News Agency learned from the Four Banks yesterday that the revised measures for import goods are stricter than before regarding the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods. However, some goods may be granted special permission to be imported in order to regulate the market. Specific measures for cracking down on and restricting the sale of specially permitted import goods will be stipulated.

Black Market Foreign Exchange Shows Signs of Loosening

The black market foreign exchange has shown signs of loosening in recent days. Yesterday, the British pound remained stable, while the U.S. dollar tended to increase. The banks opened with actual prices in the morning: the British pound was 2 shillings and 8.4375 pence, and the U.S. dollar was 4.8125 yuan. At the close, the British pound was unchanged, while the U.S. dollar rose to 4.84375 yuan. The afternoon closing price was the same as the morning closing price. The trend of loosening and rising in the Shanghai black market is due to the fact that general importers of non-essential goods or speculators believe that the exchange rate is still in a period of change and are waiting. On the other hand, banks with sufficient backing are willing to supply, so supply exceeds demand, and the loosening trend in recent days is probably due to this.

### Spiritual Commemoration of the Father of the Nation's Uprising Day

The 9th of this month is the anniversary of the first uprising led by the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen. It is also the combined anniversary of the Father of the Nation's London ordeal on October 11th and the Guangzhou ordeal on June 16th, as stipulated by the central government, so it is of great significance. At that time, although all sectors do not intend to hold any commemorative ceremonies due to the special environment of Shanghai, they will unanimously abide by the Father of the Nation's teachings, work hard in their respective positions, and make solemn spiritual commemorations. The concession authorities will still implement precautions for one day on this day for prevention.

### The Situation of Rice Weevil Hoarding Has Been Thoroughly Investigated and Understood; Some Cases Have Been Hoarding for More Than a Year

The paddy rice in all rice-producing areas in the country began to ear in early July of the lunar calendar. Later, due to favorable weather, it is now crab-yellow, with grains like pearls. A bumper harvest is expected in late July, and local farmers are all overjoyed, preparing to harvest. At that time, a large amount will be transported to Shanghai for regulation. According to sources from Wuhu, the local area has already relaxed the ban on the export of rice and grain, and a large amount is allowed to be transported to Shanghai for the market. Therefore, merchants from all regions are busy contacting farmers in the countryside to handle rice.

Rice Stocks Increase Sharply by More Than 50,000 Bags

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association's 127th survey (from last Saturday to this Friday) of the rice stocks in Chinese and foreign warehouses has been completed as scheduled. According to the survey results, there are a total of 1,244,258 bags of rice stored in more than 80 warehouses throughout the city (including Pudong, Hongkou, and the central district), an increase of 54,254 bags compared to the previous period. It is reported that some of the rice has been hoarded for two months, some for half a year, and some for more than a year. The association has submitted the survey results to the authorities of the two concessions and seven rice industry groups for reference.

Price Stabilization Signs to be Corrected at Any Time

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession entrusted all rice shops in the city to sell the special small broken rice from Yangon that the council had purchased at a fixed price, the results have been remarkable, and the common people have benefited greatly. Because the international situation is unstable, the number of shipping routes increases and decreases from time to time, and freight rates also change from time to time, the price of the fixed-price rice has to be revised due to cost issues. However, the rice shops that sell the rice do not correct the prices on the signs and try to sell it beyond the limit, which is illegal. The Rice Shop Association has now issued a notice to the market, saying, "For the purpose of notification, it is found that our fellow rice shops, when selling the council's Hong Kong rice, if there is a change in the fixed price, the Arabic numeral price written after the Chinese, English, and French names listed on the price sign must be corrected at the same time. Do not be negligent to avoid being punished. I hope all colleagues pay special attention to it. This is to notify you."

### Alcott Departs Shanghai for Two Months

The English-language newspaper "The China Press" reported that Mr. Alcott, a well-known American broadcaster in this port, told reporters yesterday morning that he plans to leave Shanghai on the 15th of this month for two months and will not be able to return here until December 1st to continue broadcasting. He began working as a news reporter at China American Radio Station in 1938 when the Sino-Japanese War broke out. He has not had a day off for several years. Therefore, he plans to use the two-month vacation to recuperate in another place. Mr. Alcott was originally a reporter for the English-language newspaper "The China Press" and then served as the local editor of "The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", which was well received by the general public in this port.

### American Ships Still Sail to Shanghai, Route Slightly Changed; President Coolidge Resumes Shanghai Voyage; Three Cargo Ships Scheduled to Arrive This Month; Over 100 American Nationals Depart for Home Next Week

The American President Lines' large passenger ships operating on the Pacific route, including the President Coolidge, President Cleveland, President Taft, and President Pierce, a total of seven ships, were formally

requisitioned by order

by the U.S. Maritime Commission on June 16th of this year to transport military supplies to the United Kingdom in the Atlantic.

As a result, American ships on the Pacific route suspended operations. However, the President Coolidge first resumed its voyage from the United States and arrived in Shanghai last month on the 16th. According to company sources, the ship will continue to operate on the Shanghai-U.S. route in the future, but the route will be slightly changed. It is also learned that the President Cleveland will arrive on Wednesday. The ship departed from San Francisco, passing through Honolulu, Manila, and Hong Kong to Shanghai. In addition to carrying passengers and cargo, it is also tasked with carrying

disaster relief crushed wheat

entrusted by the American Red Cross to Shanghai for disaster relief. The total amount of crushed wheat is 50,000 pounds. Some speculators in Shanghai spread rumors that after the U.S. Maritime Commission requisitioned ships, the tonnage of American ships would decrease. This statement can now be refuted. The United States is determined to maintain shipping in the Far East. Today, a cargo ship of the Halifordson Company, with a carrying capacity of 2,981 tons, will arrive here from Seattle carrying cargo. On the 9th of this month, another cargo ship, the Collinsworth, managed by Fuklaiyangxing, will sail from Seattle to Shanghai. On the 12th of this month, another cargo ship of the American President Lines will sail from New Orleans to Shanghai carrying cargo. According to the English-language newspaper "The China Press", it is learned that approximately 115 American nationals, including several from Japan, will depart from Shanghai for the United States next week.

Mr. Shinagi,

the manager of the Yuanheng Company, who has lived in Shanghai for 22 years, is also among them. It is heard that after Mr. Shinagi leaves Shanghai, the business of the Yuanheng Company will be continued by the United American Shipping Company. According to Mr. Shinagi's interview with reporters, he has mixed emotions about leaving Shanghai, but he feels that the current problems encountered by the city will be easily solved. Therefore, he hopes to return to Shanghai in the future. This trip back to the United States will be to reunite with his family who withdrew seven months ago. As for future plans, they cannot be determined until he arrives in the United States.

### Entrustment of Interests of Warring Countries; Sweden Acts as Trustee; Approximately Thirteen Countries

According to the person in charge of the Swedish Legation in this port, since the outbreak of the European War, the Swedish government has been entrusted by various warring countries to act as trustee for their interests in the respective opposing countries, including Germany, France, Poland, South Africa, Finland, the Soviet Union, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Greece, a total of thirteen countries. However, some of these countries have been invaded by Germany to end the war, and the responsibility of trusteeship has ended. The second section of the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for this trusteeship matter, and it has now handled no fewer than tens of thousands of cases.

### Domestic Postal Rates to Increase; Implemented Next Year

Regarding the increase in domestic postal rates, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Ministry of Communications does have this plan and has submitted the case to the Executive Yuan for approval. People in the Shanghai postal industry said that this matter will be postponed to January 1st of next year because preparations require a considerable period. Recently, due to inconvenient transportation and increased costs of mail transportation, the increase in postal rates is actually a reasonable measure and cannot be criticized.

### Coal Briquette Raw Materials Pour In; Black Market Prices Fall

According to news from the French Shipping Company yesterday, the company's Los Wheel arrived at this port from Haiphong, Vietnam, yesterday, carrying 1,500 tons of Hongji coal. The ship is berthed at buoys 22 and 23 of the Huangpu River. It is also learned that the company's Beinashengting Wheel is also expected to arrive in Shanghai with a large amount of Hongmu coal from Haiphong in the next few days. Hongji coal is the main raw material for manufacturing coal briquettes, so yesterday, due to smooth supply, the black market price of coal briquettes has fallen.

### Short-Distance Route Opened Between Hong Kong and Guilin; Took Off on the First of this Month

### Elderly Westerner Panson Dies Suddenly; Death Certificate Not Issued by Hospital

The English-language newspaper "The China Press" reported that Panson, a Westerner, was 65 years old, born in Colonia, Uruguay. His parents were British. He lived in Shanghai, residing in room 527 of the Navy YMCA. He had been ill recently, and just one week ago, he was discharged from the hospital and returned to the YMCA. Yesterday (the 4th), at about 3:30 PM, when a Westerner in the association was wiping the window, he suddenly saw that Panson was still lying in bed and had not gotten up. However, the lying position was unusual. He approached and saw that he had been dead for a long time. He then summoned investigators from the Central Police Department to investigate the scene and transported the body to the morgue of the Public Hospital for examination. The hospital has not yet issued a certificate stating the cause of death, so the Health Department of the Public Works Bureau has not allowed the body to be buried. It is heard that the British Consulate recognizes that Panson is not British, but Uruguayan.

### Shortcut from Shanghai to the Southwest; Hong Kong-Zhanjiang Ship Ticket Prices

The most convenient route for transportation between Shanghai and the Southwest is currently the one via Zhanjiang (Guangzhou Bay). Shanghai has a special ship that directly loads passengers and cargo, but it is irregular. Currently, the route via Hong Kong is still more convenient. There are two ships, "Great Gem" and "Great Shunkang", operating from Hong Kong to Zhanjiang, which takes one day to reach. The fare is 65 yuan for first class, 32 yuan for second class, and 20 yuan for third class. Alternatively, you can take a steamship from Hong Kong to Macau, and then transfer to the French ship "Yida" from that port to Zhanjiang. The fare is HK$55.70 for first class. From Zhanjiang to Liuzhou, the total journey takes more than ten days. The travel expenses vary greatly depending on the amount of luggage and the extravagance of food and accommodation along the way. Usually, for those with little luggage, it costs at least 600 yuan.

### A Section of Yuanfang Road is Already Blocked

According to the Public Works Bureau, a section of Yuanfang Road south of East Broadway was originally private property. In 1873, the Bureau obtained the owner's consent to open it for public use. Now that it no longer has public value, but provides a route for general villains to reach the pier, the Bureau will block the section of road.

### Yarn Factories Face Difficulties Due to Lack of Raw Materials and Insufficient Power; Japanese Yarn Factories Plan to Implement a Rotational Rest System

According to a Japanese newspaper, after the United Kingdom and the United States announced asset freeze orders, the import of foreign cotton to Shanghai, according to the normal explanation of normal imports, can only be obtained by Chinese and foreign merchants who can obtain foreign exchange at the official price from banks in Hong Kong. However, Japanese merchants cannot obtain this foreign exchange. Therefore, the amount of foreign cotton imported into Shanghai is extremely small. The Hong Kong banking community has also been instructed by the Stabilization Board to

only supply a part

of the official foreign exchange for cotton and to do its utmost to prevent black market transactions. Moreover, the official exchange rate was suspended once again on the 1st of this month. Therefore, the amount of cotton imported is only enough for Chinese and foreign textile companies to continue operating at 50% capacity. It is expected that the future import situation in Shanghai will be further reduced. Due to the lack of cotton raw materials, changes may occur in the Shanghai textile industry. However, the main reason for the rapid shortening of working hours by the textile companies is the power problem. Therefore, the attention of all parties concerned is focused on the Shanghai Power Company. A sharp increase in unemployment will cause unrest in the concession and cause the industry to shrink. Based on the above points, there should be room for negotiation on the implementation of

saving a lot of electricity.

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the remaining strength of its closed factories has exceeded the electricity saved by a large amount of electricity conservation. However, recently, due to the problem of coal sources, Japanese textile companies are studying countermeasures and plan to formulate a rotational rest system on Sundays and at night. However, if the Shanghai Power Company adopts the reasons for difficulty in obtaining raw materials and the percentage of achievement, various factories will be closed, and night work will be completely abolished. As a result, the number of daytime electricity consumption will increase sharply, and the amount of nighttime electricity consumption will be reduced to a minimum.

The staff has been working hard to investigate and review the various matters and is publishing the approved scholarship list daily. The application deadline was yesterday. Except for those who can prove that their applications were mailed yesterday, the receipt of application forms will be stopped from today. A considerable number of those who have been awarded scholarships have already enrolled in schools. However, regarding the scholarship part, there are some matters that need to be clarified to the schools. The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund Committee has determined the amount of scholarships for applying students based on (1) the degree of their poverty; (2) in addition to subsidizing tuition fees, other expenses are borne by the students themselves. Therefore, students who receive scholarships, if there is a surplus in the subjects they have enrolled in, please inform the schools, or donate it to the newspaper's scholarship fund to help students who apply later. We are grateful for this. If there is a shortfall in the students' tuition fees, please ask the schools to order the students to make up the payment to comply with the regulation of "determining the amount based on the degree of poverty." We have always been supported by the schools, and we should be appreciated.

### Rice Shop Manager Defrauds for Profit, Case Complex, Further Investigation Pending

Shen Xiaodi, a shareholder of Tongxing Rice Shop at No. 6, Lane 577, Haining Road, purchased 47 bags of rice from Yuchengtai Rice Shop at No. 10, Fujian Road, at a price of 7,455.66 yuan at the Qinglian Pavilion Market on Fuzhou Road on August 28. Cao Qiusheng, the owner of the shop, suspected nothing and immediately sent the old clerk to deliver the rice to Tongxing Rice Shop, with payment scheduled for September 3. When Cao went to Tongxing to collect the payment the day before yesterday afternoon, all the partners of the shop had disappeared, and the goods in the shop had also been moved away, leaving only two or three old clerks guarding the door. Cao, in desperation, reported to the Mixed Court, which sent detectives to keep watch. The day before yesterday morning, Hua Yongxing (a Qingpu native manager), a partner of the shop, was arrested by detectives outside the shop. According to his confession, Sun Guigen, Chen Chengren, Yao Qiushen and three other accomplices were arrested in Room 425 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, and a check, 1,000 yuan in cash, and six account books were seized. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court to apply for a postponement. The defendant Hua Yongxing confessed that he was also one of the victims. Shen Jundi invited Sun Guigen and seven others to join our Tongxing Rice Shop this spring, each with a capital of one or two thousand yuan. At first, everything was fine, but he did not know that Shen had evil intentions and defrauded Yuchengtai Rice Shop of 47 bags of rice. When he fled, he also took away a large amount of cash from the shop's silver box, and so on. After reviewing the situation, the court briefly questioned Sun Guigen and others, and then approved the postponement of the investigation of the case.

Subsequently, Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Detective Kong Guangxiao of the Putuo Police Station arrested the driver, Ma Songtao, and rescued the hostage. The other bandits all escaped. After investigation, he was escorted to the First Special Court and prosecuted for murder and kidnapping. Judge Jiang Shuzi concluded the trial. Yesterday morning, the verdict was proposed: Ma Songtao was sentenced to seven years in prison for conspiring to kidnap for extortion, and was found not guilty of the remaining charges.

### Yang Meinan Memorial Service to Be Held at the Lake Society Tomorrow Afternoon

Mr. Yang Meinan of Zhongshan Ao passed away last month, as reported in previous newspapers. It is reported that his family will hold a memorial service at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road tomorrow (7th) on the occasion of the Fifth Yu Day. Mr. Yang's relatives and friends have decided to hold a joint memorial service at the society at 4:00 PM that afternoon. Mr. Yang served in Taikoo for 53 years, holding the position of Chinese General Manager. He was loved by both Chinese and Western staff of the company. Mr. Yang was always sincere in his social undertakings. In Yantai, he initiated the establishment of the Guangdong School and the Guangdong Native Place Association, and served as the president of the local YMCA, Anti-Drug Association, and Red Cross Society. After arriving in Shanghai, he served as the first vice president of the Guangdong Native Place Association and as a director of the Guangzhao Public Hall, the Cantonese Overseas Chinese Businessmen's Association, Renji Hospital, Cantonese Business Hospital, and Guangdong East Middle School. Mr. Yang was very concerned about the suffering of the people. During the floods in Guangdong Province in the years of Wushen, Jiaoyin, and Yimao, the people were starving. Mr. Yang resolutely cooperated with the late Mr. Chen Bingqian to transport grain back to Guangdong to stabilize prices, and negotiated with the Taikoo authorities to provide free transportation, saving countless lives. During the January 28th and August 13th Incidents, Mr. Yang immediately joined forces with Mr. Feng Bingnan and Mr. Lin Bingyan to send all the Cantonese overseas Chinese in Shanghai who had no home to return to Guangdong. At that time, the compatriots from Minshan, Shantou, Ningbo and other places who were stranded in Shanghai and voluntarily returned to their original places were generally sent back to their hometowns by the Taikoo Changju at reduced rates. His lifelong good deeds have been praised to this day. It is reported that Chinese and Western personnel in Yantai will also hold a memorial service in the city tomorrow.

Mr. Wang has been well-known in the industry for more than ten years. He usually promoted scientific management, established schools and cultivated talents, and made great contributions to society and the country. His articles and morals are admired by people. It is also reported that Mr. Wang's close friends, disciples, and related groups plan to participate in the public memorial service at the same time, and plan to publish a commemorative album and collect Fuli Textile Scholarships after the event to last for a long time. It is expected that at that time, there will be a scene of sorrow and honor on the side of Hart Road.

### Ministry of Education Gives Preferential Treatment to Overseas Chinese Students Taking Entrance Exams for Domestic Universities, Entrance Credentials Approved to Be Replaced with Film

(Hong Kong Correspondence) It is inconvenient for Hong Kong students to apply for domestic universities because of the inconvenient transportation between Hong Kong and Chongqing. It takes a lot of time to submit credentials, and there is a fear of loss. In the past, some schools could allow the use of film of the credentials instead. The Ministry of Education can provide convenience to students with equivalent academic qualifications. It is necessary to obtain a passing certificate for the entrance examination of the University of Hong Kong, and the students who passed the examination of the Hong Kong Education Department have the qualifications to apply for the university. Now I know that the Ministry of Education will give preferential treatment to students to apply for domestic schools. To provide convenience, the sections will be answered separately as follows: (1) Considering the inconvenient transportation between Hong Kong and Chongqing, the credentials submitted by new students admitted to universities each semester will be temporarily allowed to be replaced by film of the credentials. (2) It is still difficult to make changes to the recruitment of students with equivalent academic qualifications in private colleges and universities. (3) All students who have participated in the entrance examination of the University of Hong Kong and obtained the certificate have the qualifications to apply for the university. (4) Students who have passed the examination of the Hong Kong Education Department must return to their original school for one year to complete the first class of high school before they can apply for the university.

### Shanghai Refugee Children's Shelter Solicits Textbooks and Supplies

The Shanghai Refugee Children's Shelter was established after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. It was originally located in the Hanqing Youth Middle School on Jessfield Road, sheltering refugee children (aged four to fourteen), providing them with appropriate education, and teaching them various handicrafts. Now, due to the use of all school buildings, the shelter can only be temporarily moved to the Betel Hospital in the Nanshi District to continue its work. However, as various prices have soared recently, in addition to feeling a lack of funds and insufficient clothing and bedding, the shelter is unable to purchase all grades of textbooks for the six-year elementary school system, such as Chinese, Arithmetic, Hygiene, Common Sense, Nature, Society, Civics, English, History, Geography, etc. (the above requires about 2,000 yuan), and supplies such as notebooks, tracing books, notebooks, handmade paper, large regular script books, small regular script books, pencils, erasers, large regular script pens, small regular script pens, slates, black ink, etc. (the above requires 470 yuan). It is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life who care about the education of children will provide the greatest assistance and donate as many textbooks or extracurricular reading materials as possible. Please send donations to No. 208, Zhonghui Building, Avenue Edward VII, or directly to Betel Hospital, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Nanshi District.

Everyone who knows Mr. Du Yuesheng knows that he possesses passionate and uninhibited enthusiasm and a resolute and composed spirit. In the early winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China, he left Shanghai voluntarily and resided in Hong Kong. He also went to Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and other places to inspect and assist the production efforts in the rear. Four years passed like the snap of a finger. The people of Shanghai hold Mr. Du in high esteem. Whenever friends from Hong Kong returned to Shanghai, they would eagerly inquire, "How is Mr. Du doing?"

Mr. Du in Hong Kong is still the same as he was in Shanghai, with just as many guests and just as many matters needing his attention. He labors for half the day in his Kowloon residence in the morning, and in the afternoon, he crosses the sea to Hong Kong, where another large group of people awaits his guidance. In this way, he resolved many major issues and rescued many young people. He always appears fearless of difficulties, diligent and sincere, which is truly moving. In the summer, he refuses to take off his long gown, appearing every inch a scholar. He declines all unnecessary social engagements. Once, a friend insisted on inviting him to see a play. He said that if it were a play performed for disaster relief, he would certainly go, because there would be some charitable element in the entertainment. But if it were just for a night of pleasure and enjoyment, he would have to postpone it to another day.

We expect Mr. Du to be a pillar of the nation, and we hope that he will take care of himself for the sake of the country. Today is his birthday, and we send our remote wishes from the south, filled with endless longing!

Anecdotes

### The Anecdote of the Diamond

— Zuo You

If you think that diamonds are the rarest and most precious gemstones in the world, then you are mistaken; you have fallen for the British. Because there is a place on Earth where both the surface and underground are covered with diamonds the size of broad beans. If you could go there and pick up a few, you would immediately become incredibly wealthy. If people were to excavate all the diamonds in that area, every woman would be able to wear a huge diamond ring on her finger.

This place is located near the coast where the Union of South Africa borders Portuguese Angola. Originally, this area was full of high mountains and sand dunes, with a scorching climate and no birds or animals. Often, one could travel hundreds of miles without seeing a single living thing. Who would pay attention to such a barren land? Later, a European explorer, Dr. P. A. Wagner, happened to pass by the mouth of the Kunene River and discovered that the sand along the river shone with strange light under the sun. Out of curiosity, Wagner brushed aside the sand under his feet, picked up a handful of transparent stones, and almost fainted with surprise. He realized that the pile in his palm was composed entirely of priceless diamonds. Dr. Wagner reported this discovery to the Geographical Society of South Africa, but for some reason, people were skeptical of the discovery and did not take it seriously. However, it caught the attention of another explorer, Dr. Hans Merensky. Merensky immediately went there to investigate. He traveled extensively in this area and went deep inland, discovering numerous other important diamond mines. Merensky meticulously recorded the locations of the mines on a map and collected many large diamonds. Just as he was about to leave this precious land temporarily and return to Europe, he suddenly realized that his supplies of dry food and drink had been exhausted, and the horse he was riding was so hungry and thirsty that it was about to collapse. At that critical moment, he suddenly saw some green grass growing in the sand in the distance. He led his horse closer, and the horse began to graze on the plants with relish. At this point, the starving Dr. Merensky had no choice but to use these plants as his only source of sustenance. (This type of grass is called Welwitschiamirabilis in scientific terms. It grows in the sand of South Africa. The grass has two large leaves growing near the root. It is said that this plant has a very long life and can live for up to a hundred years. Its roots contain a large amount of water.)

Dr. Merensky returned to Europe with many diamonds and suddenly became wealthy. The Diamond Trade Association of London, England, was alarmed upon hearing the news because if everyone went to collect diamonds, the value of diamonds would plummet. In order to maintain the value of diamonds, the association paid Dr. Merensky 100 million pounds for his detailed map. Then, they purchased all the areas where diamond mines were marked, and built barbed wire fences around each area, and dispatched armed personnel to patrol, prohibiting anyone from entering those areas.

But no one knows how long the British can keep this diamond mine, because the Germans, who are watching with greedy eyes, need a large number of diamonds for their industrial needs.

Historical Talk

### Building a City

— Zhu Yu

(A New Interpretation of Ai Zi, Part 3)

We already know that the King of Qi only knows how to enjoy himself and only wants to satisfy his personal desires. The greatest of these desires, of course, is to remain king for thousands of years. So, one day he announced his "grand plan" to his civil and military officials—Ai Zi was naturally among them—saying:

"If our country is to last for thousands of years in the world, the most effective way is to have the whole country—build a great city, starting from the East Sea, passing through Jimo, Daxing, Huanyuan, and Wuguan, winding for four thousand miles. Then Qin, Chu, Han, and Wei will not dare to covet our country. It is truly a great undertaking!"

"Won't this make the people groan?" one official said.

"What is there to fear about that?" the King of Qi replied immediately. "The people are all slaves by nature. As long as you suppress them, who will dare to move? You can also use soft tactics, just tell the people that although building the city is a bit hard now, the peace and comfort they will enjoy afterward will be endless. If you publicize it this way, who won't come happily?"

Ai Zi felt really uncomfortable when he heard this, so he straightened his court tablet and said to the King of Qi:

"Today, when I came to court, I happened to encounter heavy snow. Many people were lying in the snow without clothes. One person looked at the sky and said, 'We are welcoming the snow, because the white snow indicates that next year will be a good year, and we will have cheap rice to eat!' But someone insensitive next to him replied: 'Old fellow, what you say is true, but we may freeze to death this year!' Does Your Majesty know what this story is about?"

"Does Ai Qing mean that we shouldn't build a great city?" the King of Qi said in a low voice.

"I hope that Your Majesty will consider it carefully." Ai Zi stepped aside.

Today, there are many ambitious people who drive millions of their people to invade other countries, while deceiving the people by establishing some kind of "great empire." Isn't that just like this King of Qi?

Twelve Unexpected Troubles

However, they had not considered that no matter how careless Shang Lao Er and Manager Meng were, they would never send someone from their shop or home to deceive Mei Bao. Because Mei Bao herself would be the first to recognize them. At that time, Begonia and Little Gouzi Chen Da, the three of them, did not think of this at all, so the result was still a fruitless trip. Chen Da circled around the front and back of Manager Meng's house, but he could no longer see the middle-aged man who had come from the county middle school that day to deceive Mei Bao.

"I don't necessarily mean that your relatives kidnapped my daughter, but things happened to coincide so coincidentally, just when we were having some disagreements, she was lost. So I have to come over and discuss it with you. It would be best if you could send someone to ask that maternal great-uncle, maybe he called Mei Bao away, then I can rest assured." Because I have no evidence, Begonia could not help but humbly consult with Manager Meng.

Little Gouzi and Chen Da stood aside indignantly.

"Okay, since that's the case, we are old neighbors who are very familiar with each other, how can we not help!" Manager Meng tried his best to hide his old and cunning face and said very seriously. "Tomorrow, I will ask Lin Sheng to go into the city and find his friend surnamed Liu at his house."

Begonia did not wait for him to finish speaking, and hurriedly thanked him repeatedly. (204)

Invention

### Fishing Gun

— Ke Si

Among the hobbies of Westerners, fishing can be said to be one of the most popular. Fishing is a small amateur skill, but they do not take it lightly. Instead, many specialized books have been published, making detailed reviews and studies of the art of fishing. For example, U.S. President Roosevelt is a famous "fisherman."

Recently, the U.S. Patent Office has received a new fishing-related invention patent application, which is the fishing gun shown in the picture. The purpose of this fishing gun is to help novice fishermen, so that the bait they cast is more accurate and does not stray too far from the target. When the fisherman launches the bait towards the target, a fishing line is connected to the gun, so this gun is also a fishing rod. This type of fishing rod is much more convenient to carry.

Education

### Don't Cry

— Feng

Often, many parents beat their children until they cry and then immediately tell them to stop crying. What a contradiction!

Because after being beaten, children not only suffer great physical pain, but also suffer unusual wounds in their hearts. Therefore, crying becomes the only expression of pain. However, most parents simply do not allow crying! Isn't this too inhumane?

Even if they don't cry! Although on the surface it may seem like nothing, their hearts must be more painful and more uncomfortable than before!

Let's take ourselves as an example. If we are beaten or scolded by others, or if we are very sad and need to cry, but others happen to stop us and forbid us to cry, what kind of feeling will we have then?

If we put ourselves in the child's shoes, then we will not do this. Because people's feelings are always the same!

### Yang Baosen Hired Again as Second Fiddle (Part 1)

— Shao Kai

Recently, Cheng Yanqiu was discussing with Ping Hui and Wang Yaoqing about performing in Shanghai. Yaoqing asked, "This time you go out, are you taking Shaolin or Shaolou as the old man?" Yanqiu said, "I've been researching the second-fiddle old man for quite some time. Shaolou's voice simply cannot go outside. Last time I went to Yantai and Qingdao, Shaolin was with me. I think it's better to take Shaolin. But Baosen has some unfinished business with Huangjin. Huangjin's idea is to have Baosen cooperate with me. However, Baosen is now a leading role, hiring again..."

Before Yanqiu could finish speaking, Yaoqing interrupted, "Old Fourth, I understand what you mean. You're saying that Baosen is already a leading role, so hiring him as a second fiddle may not be appropriate. This makes sense, but it depends on the situation. If your name is at the top when Baosen is second fiddle, it won't look bad for him." Yanqiu quickly said, "Uncle, please don't praise me!" Yaoqing said again, "It's the truth, not just trying to be nice. Don't even mention Baosen; even if Xi Xiaobo, if Lanfang wanted to perform now and asked him to be the second fiddle, he would still go. People should be like that. Although Baosen's skills are good, he has few plays that can draw a crowd. Going to Shanghai to be the leading role may not work out. Cooperating with you, he doesn't have to take risks, and he's sure to be successful. The day before yesterday, Sun Lanting, the manager of the Shanghai Huangjin Grand Theater, came to my house to discuss Cheng Yuqing's matter." Yanqiu was about to ask Yaoqing what Yuqing had to do with the Shanghai Huangjin Grand Theater! Yaoqing seemed to understand and continued, "Yuqing used to worship a certain celebrity as his teacher when he was in Shanghai, and Sun Lanting is also a disciple of that celebrity. They are bound by their fellow discipleship, so Lanting came to me to plead for him. He said that even if you don't recognize him as your disciple, you can't forbid him from performing outside. Yuqing still has a wife and children, so I naturally couldn't bear to let him have no food to eat. So I agreed to Lanting's request and even specially wrote this sentence in the newspaper advertisement. When Lanting came that day, he also mentioned the issue of Baosen being the second fiddle. I said to Lanting, "If Baosen doesn't want to, I can advise him as an elder (Yaoqing is Baosen's uncle), and there shouldn't be any problem." Yanqiu said, "Baosen's engagement in Shanghai was directly negotiated by Huangjin, and has nothing to do with our Qiusheng Society."

### Zhou Xinfang's New Residence

— Jing Chun

Everyone knows everything about Qilin Tong's dramatic art, but his kindness, righteousness, and filial piety are even more praised. Li Jirui in the north and Zhou Xinfang in the south are two people whose actions are indeed not easy to find in the opera world. After the disbandment of the Yifeng Society, which Zhou presides over, he is reading and painting at home. In addition to helping with public good deeds or performing free shows, he temporarily decided not to perform for the time being. Recently, Ma Lianliang spent 200,000 yuan to buy a house in the British Concession of Tianjin, while Xinfang bought a western-style house at the intersection of Pushi Road and Shanzhong Road in this city for 170,000 yuan and moved in recently. The two famous actors in the north and south shine together, which can be said to be rare.

### Miscellaneous Drama Notes

— Fen Yu

The Great Stage The Great Stage sent personnel to Beiping to pick up Tan Fuying to come south, but for some reason, there is still no definite response. During this transition period, the stage is continuing to rehearse myths, monsters, and swordsmen.

The Gong Stage prepared to stage the second act of Just Me, but because the business of Magpie Bridge Meeting was very good, they discussed and decided with the protagonist Zhao Ruquan to postpone the performance.

The six-part new Journey to the West at the Xinsheng Stage will be performed tonight. The highlight of the entire play is the transformation of the apes fighting the real and fake Sun Wukong, with Wang Fuying playing the six-eared macaque, with a great fighting scene.

Lu Wenyi received a letter from Li Wanchun, inviting him to Beiping to manage everything at the Mingchun Society. Because he was unable to leave Shanghai temporarily, he declined.

Miss Lu Mengying, a famous amateur Kunqu opera singer, hosted a reception at the Atlantic on the 5th to welcome Ma Yanfen, the new star of Huangjin. Many amateur opera singers and celebrities from all walks of life attended. It is also heard that Miss Lu will publish a special publication on the day of Ma's debut to promote the show.

The nine-day running play at Huangjin The first day, Zhang Wenjuan The Empty City Ruse, Ma Yanfen Yu Tangchun; the second day, Zhang Ma will perform the visiting mother; the third day, Zhang The Pot of Black Clay, Ma Will perform The Happy Union, or Six-Month Snow.

### Notes on Characters in the Pear Garden

— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustration by Zhang Yizhang

(37) Huang Guiqiu

Huang Guiqiu is the one who went from amateur to professional after Zhu Qinxin. After Guiqiu became a professional, he studied with the late actor Chen Delin. However, his art is not entirely based on Chen. However, he followed the rules and his rhythms are quite accurate. Although he is not an ancient tune, he can still avoid the contemporary habits. In the current state of the collapsed song stage, it is rare to have such a talent with such integrity. But Guiqiu was still unsuccessful because of this. He repeatedly tried to start a troupe, but failed repeatedly. Recently, I heard that he has voluntarily stepped down to the second tier and is still the "sidekick" for the lead. To be fair, Guiqiu's plays are inferior to Wang Youqing Zhu Qinxin Yu Yuqing in various aspects (Zhu Qinxin's plays are the most complete and also excels in young female roles. The wonders of her play The Happy Union is even better than Hui Sheng and Cuihua.) Only his voice is clear and pure, which far surpasses everyone else. Having such a tool to win, yet he still finds it difficult to achieve his goals, is probably because his appearance is not beautiful and charming enough, so he is trapped and unable to stretch his eyebrows and breathe. This is especially true for Guiqiu. Even Qinxin, Youqing, and Yuqing are unable to soar freely with future generations because of this. Looking back, Nanyie, who is shy in his manners and unfamiliar with the rhythms, seems to be rejecting the rear forces and resisting the front. He is gradually showing an upward trend. How can it be said that this is not a matter of unevenness?

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

Chapter 16: Taking the Delicate Bird out of the Cage Early

He hurriedly stepped forward, snatched the ribbon from Yuanyuan's hand, and hugged her, saying, "Yuanyuan Yuanyuan, you are such a good daughter, born with difficulty, hard to find in the world, how can you not cherish yourself and seek death? If you die, how can I, an old man, live?" When Yuanyuan heard these words, her heart filled with sadness and she shed tears, dejected and speechless. Tian Hongyu comforted her with many kind words and became more vigilant from then on, not allowing her to commit suicide easily. Since Yuanyuan could not bear to die, she lived a life of grievance in Tian Hongyu's residence, always depressed and unhappy. Tian Hongyu loved her very much. Because she was proficient in music, he taught her to be the leader of the female musicians. Tian Hongyu's female musicians were famous in the capital. Now that Yuanyuan was the leader, it was even better, surpassing her peers. Generally, dukes and ministers who loved music often came to Tian Hongyu's residence to listen to wonderful tunes. Tian Hongyu was even more proud, and every time he asked Yuanyuan to sing and toast wine. And every time Yuanyuan sang the song of High Mountains and Flowing Water, Tian Hongyu tapped his fingers and praised her. How would he know that Yuanyuan's intention was to mourn the loneliness of a soulmate? After getting Yuanyuan, when Tian Hongyu selected beauties and sang in his residence, it was like accumulating firewood under the house, and he naively thought he was safe. Although there were still many wealthy families in the capital, with their lights, wine, and luxury, and the sound of bamboo and silk music, they were enjoying themselves while they could. However, the alarms of the bandits invading the east became more urgent every day, and even the nine-layered city gates felt threatened. Emperor Chongzhen was worried and depressed, and he thought of General Wu Sangui outside Shanhaiguan. He immediately issued an edict summoning Sangui to meet him. When Wu Sangui rushed to the capital overnight, Emperor Chongzhen met him on the platform and felt that he was young and handsome, worthy of being a general. During the Q&A, he liked him very much and wanted him to transfer troops from outside the pass to suppress the bandits. He gave him a python robe and a jade belt, and also bestowed a sword of power, showing his reliance on Sangui. (161)
