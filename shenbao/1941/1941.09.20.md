### America Asserts Its Anti-Aggression Obligation; Will Not Concede to Japan; Pessimism Looms Over the Future of Relations; Japan Publicly Declares Acquisition of Dutch East Indies Resources

United Press, Washington, 19th – President Roosevelt met last night with Secretary of State Hull and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, but they all declined to disclose the content of the talks to the press.

Reuters, Washington, 19th – The Tokyo Japan Times, mouthpiece of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, yesterday published remarks by a spokesman for the Japanese Army Ministry. This seems to be a complete response to the general belief that a large-scale US-Japan agreement is in the works. The spokesman stated that Japan is determined to continue the war against China to the end, regardless of any opposition, and will definitely acquire resources from the Dutch East Indies. Although such remarks may not represent the Japanese government, the speaker is an important administrative figure in the Japanese government, and expressing the opinions that Prince Konoe mentioned in his letter to President Roosevelt in the Foreign Ministry's organ is indeed very significant. No one yet knows the contents of Konoe's private letter, but it is widely believed that the Army Ministry spokesman's remarks yesterday represented the views of the Japanese military, and these views are also the views of most of those with the authority to speak. The spokesman also said that what Japan is fighting for is the liberation of China from the shackles of white people. This statement will undoubtedly be denounced by Washington officials. According to one observer, Japan's slaughter of millions of Chinese and the狂炸 (this is exactly what's in the orginal, so I left it that way) of its capital cannot be regarded as a proper way to liberate the Chinese. In other words, Japan's sincerity is still in question. Time Magazine today described Japanese Ambassador Nomura as a man standing between a strong domestic army and a strong president in Washington, and said that it is impossible to find a responsible person in Washington who dares to assert that US-Japan talks can go beyond the stage of diligent hope. The United States has unavoidable military obligations to China, the Netherlands, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Although Japan has its difficulties in not being able to compromise in Vietnam or China, the United States, having asserted its obligation to oppose aggressors, cannot make major concessions to Japan to save face when Japan does not try to compromise. Japan also cannot make major concessions that would allow the United States to ship 池必再運 into Japan. The United States has not given a morally effective response to Chiang Kai-shek's statement that "a drop of oil from Tokyo is several gallons of blood from Chongqing." At a time when the oil shipments to Vladivostok have clearly demonstrated that Japan's threats on this critical matter are merely empty words, it is impossible to know what Japan will do. However, a pessimistic aura certainly hangs over the future of US-Japan relations today.

United Press, Manila, 19th – Walter of the New York Herald Tribune arrived here from Hong Kong on the 咋搭飛 (this is exactly what's in the orginal, so I left it that way) stated, "The United States will not appease Japan at this time, as American public sentiment will not allow it." He stated that he personally believed that if the United States were to appease Japan, it would be worse than Munich. The American public's attitude is inclined towards China and against Japan. He had stayed in Hong Kong and 重度勾留 for ten weeks, waiting for an entry permit to Moscow, but was finally ordered to return to New York.

### If the United States is Drawn into the Eastern War, Submarines Will Be Important Weapons; The United States Will Repel Japanese Offensives with Bombers

United Press, New York, 19th – Retired Navy Rear Admiral Stirling said that if the United States is drawn into the Eastern war, the submarine situation is worthy of attention, because Japan's submarine strength is superior to that of the United States. Statistically speaking, the United States Navy has 102 submarines that can only operate at short distances. In terms of the evolution of modern submarines, these ships are not very effective. Japan has about sixty long-range modern submarines, the rest of which were built in recent years. Therefore, the ratio between Japan and the United States is three to two. Once war breaks out, the United States will dispatch the US fleet from Hawaii to the Far East, and the fleet will be accompanied by forty modern submarines. The remainder will be used as defenses in Hawaii, the Philippines, Guam, etc. These modern submarines can only be used to attack enemy ships. If Japan is the enemy in this war, then the transportation costs for its home country and troops in China should also be noted. Japan's submarine attacks will target US battleships operating in Singapore and the Philippines. At the same time, it is also necessary to prevent Japanese submarines from attacking supply lines to Australia and the Dutch East Indies, as well as routes from the United States through the Pacific and the Cape of Good Hope. The maintenance of US troops in the Far East requires a large number of supply ships, and these ships will become the main target of submarine attacks. Japan will devote itself to both submarine and aerial attacks against the US fleet. Therefore, the US fleet must have a large number of anti-submarine ships to prevent submarines from attacking 中力 battleships. Since Japanese submarines have a range of 15,000 miles, their zone of operations can include areas from Taiwan, Hainan Island, Vietnam, and the Mariana Islands (Saipan Island), Yap Island, and Palau Islands, to the territorial waters of the East Indies and along the Chinese coast. Japanese submarines will cooperate with land-based aircraft, similar to what Germany is currently using in the Atlantic war. The United States' strength lies in concentrating a large number of bombers in the Far East to repel Japanese air offensives and seeking out Japanese submarines in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies to bomb them. In addition to sending submarines into Japanese-controlled waters, the United States should also reserve them for reconnaissance when the fleet leaves its base during wartime. When the fleet moves, these submarines will advance in the vanguard or on both sides to scout for the movements of enemy warships. When submarines detect the approach of the enemy, they can report to their commander by radio and attack with torpedoes. It is not impossible for Japan to dispatch several of its long-range submarines to the vicinity of Hawaii and the US Pacific coast to harass ships along the US coast via the Panama Canal. The purpose of this feint is to undermine morale and possibly pressure the United States to keep its battleships on the Pacific coast; otherwise, these battleships can be transferred to the Far East to assist, it is said.

### If the Dutch East Indies is Attacked, the UK Will Not Sit Idly By; Cooper Meets with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies; Will Travel to Australia in the Coming Days

Reuters, Batavia, 19th – Sir Duff Cooper, the British Cabinet's Special Representative for the Far East, gave a speech to reporters immediately after arriving here, saying that if we had as much preparation in the West as we do in the East, there might not be any aggression at all. He came to this question as soon as possible, met with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, and will return to Singapore immediately to meet with Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, so time is very valuable. He intends to improve cooperation in the Pacific region, the British Ambassadors to China and Japan, the Minister to Thailand, the Consul-General to the Philippines, and the coordination of reports from Hong Kong and the self-governing territories, so that they can be comparable to the situation in the Near East. He emphasized that the current tranquility in the Far East is definitely not due to the United States negotiating with Japan at the expense of China. When he mentioned the Dutch East Indies, he said that the United Kingdom will definitely not stand idly by while its allies are attacked. He will travel to Australia soon, where he will stay for three weeks, and will return to Singapore via the Dutch East Indies. When a reporter asked about the cooperation between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, he replied that the ABCD line is not just an idea in anticipation. Finally, he mentioned the newly established Far East Cooperation Council, saying that this council will eventually be headquartered in Singapore and will have close discussions with the Dutch East Indies to expedite decisions on mutual issues.

### Soviet Mines Found in the Sea Off Northern Korea; Japan Lodges a Serious Protest with the Soviet Union

Reuters, Tokyo, 19th – The Japanese Foreign Ministry announced orally on the evening of the 18th that the Japanese government has lodged a serious protest with the Soviet government because Soviet floating mines in the Sea of Japan endanger navigation. On September 1, a Korean fishing boat sank after striking a mine, and five people went missing. On September 10, another fishing boat salvaged a floating mine, which exploded and killed four people. Mines drifting near northern Korea have now caused a dangerous situation. Despite repeated warnings from the Japanese side, the Soviet government has not taken sufficient measures. Since August 25, more than ten floating mines have been salvaged in Japanese territorial waters and nearby international waters off the eastern coast of northern Korea. Therefore, the Japanese side has strictly ordered Japanese ships not to travel at night outside northern Korea. Mine-sweeping operations are currently underway in the area. Japan wants to maintain the peace of the Sea of Japan, so it is urgently necessary to eliminate the dangers caused by mines to Japanese and foreign ships.

Reuters, Tokyo, 19th – Japanese government spokesman Ishii said this morning that Japan has not yet received a response from the Soviet side regarding its protest over Soviet mines drifting near northern Korea. According to international law, mines that have detached from their moorings should automatically become harmless, but this is not the case at present. The Japan Advertiser commented that Japan's protest is likely to be praised by all parties, and Moscow may understand that this protest is based on law and humanitarianism.

### US President Asks Congress to Continue Allocating Lend-Lease Funds; Totaling $60 Billion; Massively Supporting Anti-Axis Countries

Reuters, Washington, 19th – President Roosevelt yesterday asked Congress to approve an additional $5,985,000,000 for Lend-Lease programs. In a letter to Congress, the President said that the original $7,000,000,000 approved by Congress in March has now been used up to $6,280,000,000. The President also forwarded a letter from Budget Director Smith expressing that an additional $5,985,000,000 should be allocated, which reflects the United States' determination to meet the urgent needs of the anti-Axis countries. The largest item is $1,875,000,000 worth of agricultural and industrial products to supply the anti-Axis countries, followed by $1,190,000,000 for various armaments, including ammunition. It is reported that $685,000,000 is for aircraft and aircraft parts, such as engine parts.

United Press, Washington, 19th – President Roosevelt yesterday submitted a message to Congress requesting appropriations to continue Lend-Lease aid to countries resisting the Axis powers. He said that these funds are necessary to continue assistance until June 30, 1943. President Roosevelt also requested permission to distribute Lend-Lease materials to any country whose defense is considered important to the freedom of the United States. Therefore, the Lend-Lease program will aid the Soviet Union.

### 200 US Aircraft to be Shipped to the Soviet Union Immediately; British Government Has Agreed to Transfer

United Press, New York, 19th – Well-informed sources announced today that, in response to the Soviet Union's request for concrete assistance, the United States will expedite the shipment of nearly 200 US fighter planes to the Soviet Union. These aircraft were originally to be delivered to the United Kingdom under the Lend-Lease Act, but the US government has requested their transfer to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has already paid cash to purchase these aircraft. Most of these aircraft have already been delivered to the British representatives in the United States, but have not yet been crated, so it is believed that they will be shipped directly to the Soviet Union by ship. It is expected that the ship will sail to the White Sea ports of Arkhangelsk or Murmansk.

International News Service, Washington, 19th – Today, officials here revealed that Britain has relinquished its priority in purchasing large quantities of fighter planes and military supplies in order to expedite the delivery of these urgently needed reinforcements to the Soviet Union. Destroyers and tanks will be shipped out first. It is reported that some US aircraft have arrived in the Soviet Union and are fighting on the front lines. It was also revealed that the Soviet Union's recent appeal for assistance to both Washington and London has led the United States and Britain to agree on a new policy of full support for the Soviet Union. US officials said that Stalin frankly stated in his request that the Soviet Union's resistance depends largely on the quantity and speed of aid from the United Kingdom and the United States.

United Press, Washington, 19th – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said yesterday that the government had advanced $10 million to the Soviet Union a month ago to facilitate repayment for the purchase of war materials in the United States.

### Japanese Ship Hakone Maru Detained by the British

Reuters, Singapore, 19th – According to official announcements, the Japanese postal ship Hakone Maru, carrying 77 Japanese nationals evacuated from Mumbai and Colombo, has been detained by the authorities here pending agreement on reciprocal treatment for British nationals evacuated from Japan. Officials from the Japanese postal ship company declined to comment on the matter, and said that the ship will set sail in the near future. About 100 Japanese nationals, including the wife of the Japanese Consul-General here, are scheduled to return to Japan on the Hakone Maru.

### Solar Eclipse

Records of solar eclipses began in the Spring and Autumn period, not that there were no solar eclipses before the Spring and Autumn period, but there are no records to verify. During the Warring States period and the Qin and Chu dynasties, wars were frequent, so eclipses were omitted from records. Since the Han Dynasty, historical records have been exhaustive. However, calculations were not precise, the number of precession of the equinoxes and the system of intercalation were not complete, so solar eclipses were not only seen on the first day of the lunar month, but also on the last day, and even on the day before the last day, and sometimes on the day after the first day. For example, in the 242 years of the Spring and Autumn period, there were 36 solar eclipses, and Gu Liang believed that 26 were on the first day, 7 on the last day, 2 at night, and 1 on the second day. For example, in the 212 years of the Former Han Dynasty, there were 53 solar eclipses, 14 on the first day, 36 on the last day, and 3 on the day before the last day. In the 196 years of the Later Han Dynasty, there were 72 solar eclipses, 32 on the first day, 37 on the last day, and 3 on the second day. These are all limited to what can be seen by the human eye in one corner of the world, so there are only these numbers. By the Wei and Jin dynasties, calendrical calculations gradually became more precise, and it was known that solar and lunar eclipses could be predicted. However, as in the Tianbao period of the Northern Qi Dynasty, when a solar eclipse was about to occur, Emperor Wenxuan asked about the timing, and some said it would occur at Shen, some said at Chen, and some said at Si, but it finally occurred between Shen and You. This shows that the exact time was still difficult to determine. After the emergence of Li Chunfeng and Monk Yixing in the Tang Dynasty, the art of calendar observation became more precise. For example, during the Tang Dynasty's Yuanhe period, in the third year, on the Gui-Si day of the seventh month, there was a solar eclipse. Emperor Xianzong said to his ministers: "Yesterday, the Department of Astronomy reported that the sun would be eclipsed, and it was all as they said. Why is that?" He was indeed amazed at how accurate the calculations were. By the Yuan Dynasty, Jamal al-Din brought the Islamic calendar to China, and the Islamic Calendar Bureau was also established in the early Ming Dynasty. However, due to the differences between the lunisolar calendar and the Islamic calendar, the Shoushi Calendar授時曆 (this is exactly what's in the orginal, so I left it that way) of Guo Shoujing, the Grand Astronomer of the Yuan Dynasty, was still used. It was not until the Chongzhen period that Xu Guangqi and others used the learning of Matteo Ricci to correct the calendar and were about to implement it when the Ming Dynasty fell. In the early Qing Dynasty, Johann Adam Schall von Bell was appointed Director of the Imperial Observatory and adopted Western calendar algorithms. Therefore, the calendar cover had the words "Respectfully Ordered to be Printed According to Western Calendar Algorithms, Shixian Calendar" 時憲曆書 (this is exactly what's in the orginal, so I left it that way) to distinguish it from the old calendar. However, he was squeezed out by Yang Guangxian and others, and Tang died in sorrow. Later, because Yang made a mistake in intercalation, the method of the Westerner Ferdinand Verbiest was used again, and it has been followed to this day. Although the Gregorian calendar has been adopted since the Republic of China, solar and lunar eclipses are still based on the new moon and full moon, and the size of the tides and the progress of farming are based on the lunar calendar for convenience, so the lunisolar calendar will eventually coexist in the world.

There are no clear records of total solar eclipses in history books. Only those that were completely eclipsed are marked with "旣," as in the third year of Duke Huan of Lu, in the seventh month on the Ren-Chen day, and the eighth year of Duke Xuan, in the seventh month on the Jia-Zi day, both are recorded as "there was a solar eclipse, 旣." It was not until the Former Han Dynasty that there were descriptions of the shape of the eclipse at its maximum, such as in the fourth year of Emperor Wu's Zhenghe reign, in the eighth month on the Xin-You day, the fifth year of Emperor Yuan's Jianzhao reign, in the sixth month on the Ren-Shen day, the first year of Emperor Cheng's Heping reign, in the fourth month on the Ji-Hai day, and the first year of Emperor Ai's Yuanshou reign, in the first month on the Xin-Chou day, all are recorded as "there was a solar eclipse, not fully like a hook," but they still cannot be regarded as total eclipses. The following records are equivalent to total solar eclipses, but it is not敢斷 (this is exactly what's in the orginal, so I left it that way) asserted that they were all total eclipses.

(1) In the sixth year of Emperor An of the Eastern Han Dynasty's Yuan Chu reign, in the twelfth month on the Wu-Wu day, there was a solar eclipse, almost total, and the ground was like dusk.

(2) In the sixth year of Emperor Wen of the Song Dynasty's Yuanjia reign, in the eleventh month on the Ji-Chou day, the solar eclipse was not fully like a hook, stars were seen during the eclipse, and it did not disappear until late afternoon; Hebei was dim. In the thirtieth year, in the seventh month on the Xin-Chou day, the solar eclipse was 旣, and all the stars were seen.

(3) In the second year of Emperor Suzong of the Tang Dynasty's Shangyuan reign, in the seventh month on the Gui-Wei day, the solar eclipse was 旣, and all the major stars were seen, at four degrees of Zhang.

(4) In the first year of Emperor Bing of the Song Dynasty's Deyou reign, in the sixth month on the Geng-Zi day, the solar eclipse was 既, stars were seen, and chickens and ducks all returned home.

(5) In the twenty-ninth year of Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty's Zhiyuan reign, in the first month on the Jia-Wu day, there was a solar eclipse, and something gradually invaded the sun, unable to 旣, and the sun's body was like a golden ring, with ears on the left and right.

(6) In the twenty-first year of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty's Jingjing reign, in the seventh month on the Ji-You day, the solar eclipse was 旣, and Emperor Shizong issued an edict saying: "The solar eclipse is excessive, which is the fault of those below infringing on those above, and those who speak out will be dismissed and live in leisure." The speaker was Xia Yan, the prime minister at the time.

Whether there were total solar eclipses in the Qing Dynasty cannot be查考 (this is exactly what's in the orginal, so I left it that way) because the History of the Qing Dynasty has not yet been published. However, according to calendar scholars, a total solar eclipse can only be seen once every 360 years at the same location, so it has been 400 years since the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty. But from the perspective of the entire Earth, there are more than a few solar eclipses every year, and it is not surprising that a region can experience a total eclipse, but sometimes it happens to fall on the vast ocean or uninhabited areas. Therefore, those who encounter it consider it an oddity. For example, on May 29, 1919, a total solar eclipse was seen in Africa, South America, and other places. On June 19, 1936, a total solar eclipse was visible from the Mediterranean Sea, northward to Siberia and northern Manchuria. Last October, it was seen in South Africa and South America. Tomorrow this year (the Ren-Shen day of the eighth month of the Xin-Si year), from Xinjiang, Xining, and Lanzhou, southeastward, it will move from Wuchang and Nanchang to Fuzhou and then to the East China Sea. Shanghai is fortunately located outside the path of totality, and although it will not be able to fully appreciate the spectacular and majestic sight, if the weather is clear, what is seen will surely be different from the ordinary.

A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, casting a shadow on the Earth. Total eclipses can be seen within the path of the umbra, while partial eclipses can be seen within the path of the penumbra on either side. In the past, before the reason for solar eclipses was understood, it was believed that the sun was the essence of the sun and the symbol of the monarch. Therefore, when there was a solar eclipse, the monarch would not hold court, the three dukes would take responsibility, and drums would be beaten to provide rescue, to show that it was a disaster. Some modern people dismiss this as superstition, but in the era of dictators and autocratic emperors and leaders, if divine power was not used to restrain royal power, the facts of 残民以逞 (this is exactly what's in the orginal, so I left it that way) would be seen, and there would be no way to make them afraid. Now, it is used as a good opportunity for scientific research. For example, Einstein's theory of relativity states that the amount of refraction of starlight passing through the sun should be twice the number calculated by Newton's law of gravity. This is not easy to verify except during a total solar eclipse, and it was finally verified during the total solar eclipse in May 1919. In addition, experts in various fields want to use the total solar eclipse for measurements, such as the substances contained in the sun, the gases emitted, and the impact on meteorology. This is why modern scientists travel tens of millions of miles to observe total solar eclipses.

### Serious Situation in Ukraine; Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Kyiv; German Command Claims a Major Victory; Simultaneously Preparing for Operations in the Black Sea

TASS, Moscow, 19th – The Soviet Information Bureau released a battle report stating that on the 18th, our army fought fiercely with the enemy along the entire front. Our air force also attacked the movements of German mechanized units and infantry. On the 16th, 112 German aircraft were destroyed in aerial combat and on airfields. Our side lost 29 aircraft.

TASS, Moscow, 19th – Fierce fighting has continued near Kyiv in the past few days. Ignoring the huge losses of manpower and materials, the German fascist troops continue to reinforce their offensive. Some defensive lines in Kyiv have been broken through by the enemy, and German troops have reached the suburbs of Kyiv. Fierce fighting is underway.

United Press, Moscow, 19th – The Soviet Information Bureau announced last night that the Red Army has captured the town of N after 28 hours of fierce fighting. The communiqué stated that the German army lost 600 officers and soldiers, 12 artillery pieces, and 7 mortar launchers. 47 German soldiers were captured.

TASS, Moscow, 19th – The Soviet naval air force is very active. The Black Sea air force destroyed 60 enemy tanks and killed 300 enemy troops in the Odesa area in two days. The Baltic Red Air Force repeatedly attacked enemy mechanized units near Leningrad. Yesterday, it destroyed 15 enemy tanks and 20 trucks.

### Rumors of German Troops Attacking the Caucasus via a Risky Route Through Czechoslovakia

International News Service, London, 19th – British military circles said today that some German armored units, attempting to occupy the oil fields before winter, are taking a risky route through Czechoslovakia to attack the Caucasus, and seem to have cut off the Crimean Peninsula. It is rumored that although the German troops are taking the risk of venturing deep into enemy territory, they have still managed to occupy the important railway junction station of Perekop, which is located on the Perekop Isthmus connecting the Crimean Peninsula to the mainland. British military circles said yesterday that signs are increasingly indicating that the Axis powers are preparing to take action in the Black Sea to assist the Crimean offensive, as German and Italian warships are reportedly concentrating along the Bulgarian coast. British sources also reported today that German troops on the northern front are putting intense pressure on Murmansk.

United Press, London, 19th – British military observers today believe that General von Rundstedt's recent offensive towards Crimea is a prelude to a possible break between the Axis powers and Turkey. Experts say that, according to information received in London, German troops are attacking via Kherson, with the aim of cutting off Crimea from the mainland in order to prepare for an offensive on the peninsula from the sea, land, and air. If the peninsula is occupied, it can be used as a stepping stone for an offensive into the Caucasus. The German army seems to be focusing all its attention on capturing the entire territory of Ukraine. At the same time, the German army is also showing signs of preparing to operate in the Black Sea. The German army's ability to cut off the American supply route to the Soviet Union via Iran depends entirely on operations in the Black Sea. It is reported that powerful Italian troops have concentrated in Greece and the Aegean Sea and are considered to be a defensive force to deal with any Allied counterattacks in that area. British military experts believe that the German army will try to persuade Turkey to allow the Italian navy to enter the Black Sea in order to facilitate attacks on Crimea and the Caucasus. They emphasize that if the war spreads eastward to southern Russia, it will be much easier for the Axis powers to replenish manpower and materials via the Black Sea.

International News Service, Berlin, 19th – The German High Command announced today that the German army has won a major victory in Ukraine. The German air force and especially elite troops have broken through the Leningrad defense line. General Kishtov, a close confidant of Stalin, has been captured by the German army. A German government spokesman said that the German air force bombed Odesa from morning to night, dropping hundreds of tons of bombs, and the city turned into a sea of fire. Moscow was also attacked by German aircraft. There were naval battles in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea yesterday, and the German navy won a major victory. The Soviet side lost eight ships in 24 hours. It is reported that General Kishtov was captured near Bryansk when he went to the front line to inspect new positions and fell into the hands of the German army.

### Battle of Leningrad Halted for Now

International News Agency, Washington, 19th - Despite conflicting reports over the past three days regarding the battle for Leningrad, the lack of progress has led military observers here to believe that the fighting has at least stalled for the time being. It is widely believed that this is due to the active defense of the Soviet High Command and its full utilization of offensive and defensive tactics. The Soviet side has also remained silent on the battle situation in Leningrad and the entire long defensive line. The German headquarters has also released little information about the fighting in Leningrad, only stating that "German forces have made significant progress in the battle for Leningrad." However, according to a German reporter, the advancing troops can already see the towering spire of St. Peter's Cathedral. The reporter also noted that the fields are full of landmines, and Red Army tanks are waiting in trenches, with heavy artillery concentrated for bombardment, indicating that Leningrad is impregnable. The battle of Leningrad is comparable to the heroic battle of Madrid in the past, especially with the people of Leningrad organizing militias and bravely fighting back, which is even more commendable.

International News Agency, Moscow, 19th - The Red Army High Command announced today that Soviet forces have advanced nine miles in the Leningrad area and wiped out a German regiment in the Finnish sector. Soviet forces have also made some progress on the central front in the Smolensk area. The Soviet Union has ordered that all men aged 16 to 50 must undergo military training to establish a large reserve force, demonstrating the Soviet Union's intention to prepare for a long-term war.

TASS, Moscow, 19th - At a certain point on the Northwest Front, our artillery destroyed eight enemy tanks and armored vehicles each. At another location, our forces destroyed twelve enemy tanks, fifteen armored vehicles, and six anti-aircraft guns.

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 18th - According to news from the Soviet border, German forces on the Northern Front continue to attack small islands near the Gulf of Riga. The Red Army is fighting and retreating. German landing forces are constantly bombarding the islands and the Red Army positions along the Hanko Peninsula with heavy artillery. It is rumored that a 4,000-ton Finnish ironclad ship has been sunk by Soviet torpedo boats, drowning 250 sailors. However, this news has not yet been confirmed.

United Press, Berlin, 19th - Berlin morning newspapers today featured prominent headlines on the front page, predicting that Leningrad will face a fate no less dire than that of Warsaw within two weeks at the latest.

### Failed to Invade Dayun Mountain, Planning New Offensive, Crossing the Xinqiang River to Invade Changsha, Xue Yue Leads Large Army to Defend Hunan Border, Many Important Strongholds in Southern Hubei Under Attack

Chongqing - According to war reports from the Hunan front, Japanese forces in northern Hunan may launch a new large-scale offensive to invade Changsha. Yesterday at dawn, Japanese forces attacked south simultaneously on several routes, crossing the Xinqiang River and landing at Yingtain on the east bank of Dongting Lake. The strategy they are adopting is the same as the one used two years ago when they were frustrated and retreated after seeing Changsha in the distance. According to Chinese sources, in the Dayun Mountain battle, the Japanese were clearly trying to eliminate the threat to their left flank during the southern attack. After this battle ended on September 16, the Japanese suddenly launched a large-scale invasion of Changsha yesterday morning. It is reported that in recent weeks, the Japanese have transferred heavy reinforcements from Hankou to Yuezhou to carry out this campaign. Although the exact number of participants is not yet known, according to news from the battlefield, one detachment that crossed the Xinqiang River near Hankou has a force of 4,000. After the vanguard moved south, reinforcements continued to arrive. Another detachment landed near Shangqingshan (transliteration) opposite Yingtain on the Lianye Lake bank by motorboat. A third detachment has advanced to Shagang. Changsha is currently defended by General Xue Yue, the valiant general who defeated the Japanese two years ago. The Chinese here are now eagerly awaiting the outcome of the new major battle in Hunan. Two years ago, the Japanese also attacked Changsha in three routes and had already entered the Changsha area, but the baggage and artillery and tanks could not advance in time due to inconvenient transportation. The Chinese army suddenly launched a counterattack, cutting off the Japanese retreat route, and the Japanese hurriedly retreated north with heavy losses. Within a few days, the Chinese army completely recovered the lost territory and remained arrayed along the Xinqiang River, confronting the Japanese to this day. (Reuters, 19th)

Chongqing - War News: (1) The Battle of Dayun Mountain in northern Hunan ended on the evening of the 16th, with a total of more than 4,000 Japanese killed or wounded. After suffering this heavy blow, in order to salvage the situation, the Japanese urgently transferred a large number of troops from various battlefields to reinforce the Yueyang area, launching an attack on several routes again starting at dawn on the 18th. After being intercepted by the Chinese army separately, fierce fighting has broken out. Another route has again invaded the Shagang area and is also engaged in battle with the Chinese. (2) Since the Chinese army in southern Hubei captured Tongshan and Nanlinqiao successively, the Japanese have repeatedly sent reinforcements to counterattack, but they have all been contained by the Chinese. On the 17th, the Japanese sent more reinforcements and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese. Chinese and Japanese forces are currently engaged in bloody battles in the vicinity of these areas. (3) On the 14th, a certain unit of the Chinese army in southern Hubei captured strongholds such as Gaogiao City east of Xianning, killing more than 500 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese fled into the city in confusion. The Chinese seized five Japanese light machine guns and more than 220 rifles, and are continuing to launch a fierce attack on Xianning. (4) On the 15th, the Japanese who were rushing to Tongshan from Nanlinqiao were defeated by the Chinese army, and they took advantage of the victory to recover Nanlinqiao, Fengfengshan, Hui'ao Pass, Huanghuajian, and other places. The Japanese at Maqiao and Zhudun northwest of Tongshan are also under fierce attack by the Chinese army. (5) At 2:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, a part of the Japanese forces in Dongliu crossed Qilihu and forcibly landed at Jiangshenqiang, attacking Banchong Cen. Another part of the Japanese forces simultaneously attacked Chimei Mountain via the Shanbajiaowan. After being intercepted separately by the Chinese army, the battle was extremely fierce. The Chinese killed more than a hundred Japanese, and the Japanese could not resist and retreated. The Chinese then recovered Banchong Cen and Chimei Mountain, and captured Japanese military supplies. (6) On the morning of the 17th, a part of the Japanese forces in southern Anhui invaded Danshan, but were repelled by the Chinese army. A part of the Chinese army was sent to outflank the Japanese on the side, but they were repelled by the Chinese army.

### Tenth Anniversary of the Northeast Incident, Solemn Commemoration in Various Places, Memorial Service Held by All Sectors in the Provisional Capital, More Than 20,000 People Participating

Chongqing - Yesterday, all sectors in the provisional capital commemorated the tenth anniversary of the September 18th Incident. A memorial service was held by all sectors at 4:00 PM, attended by more than 20,000 people. Representatives from various organizations including Wu Zhihui, Wang Shijie, Hong Lanyou, Wu Guozhen, and Li Du were present. After the meeting began, the entire assembly first observed a moment of silence to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers and compatriots. Then, Chairman Liu Zhi gave the opening address, reiterating that there is no room for Japanese soldiers on Chinese territory, which was met with thunderous applause. Next, Wu Zhihui gave a speech, stating that in recent centuries, there have been two major militaristic and aggressive nations in the world: Japan in the East and Hitler's Germany in the West. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan's ambitions became more apparent. At that time, when external troubles were frequent, people mostly ignored it, but the founding father had foresight. Recently, it has been said that the founding father's revolution only aimed to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, which is a big mistake. On this day ten years ago, Japan launched the invasion and occupation of the Northeast. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang in the past decade, our country has buried itself in hard work in accordance with the principle of five years of recuperation and five years of education. It is clear that Japan is approaching its end. The current unstable situation in the world was created by Japan, followed by Germany. In the future, we should work together and at the same time expand and strengthen our national defense. Next, Wang Xingzhou from the Northeast reported on the suffering of the people in the Northeast over the past decade. He described the cruel encounters suffered by the compatriots in the Northeast in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, citing facts to illustrate the tragic situation, which filled the entire venue with sadness and indignation. His conclusion was that we must complete the task of building the country with the Three Principles of the People with the strongest efforts and a spirit of self-reliance, fight for the Three Principles of the People, and fully achieve the task of establishing a peaceful order in which all mankind can coexist and prosper. The happiness of mankind in the world today is clearly a close and related responsibility. The chaos of any country or continent will quickly affect the whole world, and its blessings and misfortunes will also affect future generations. Next, President Dai read a speech written by himself on behalf of the academy, and passed a telegram resolution of the congress, stating that 100,000 people in Chongqing, after a sad and indignant gathering and parade, vowed to be loyal to the country and obey the leadership of the government with utmost sincerity and enthusiasm, recover the lost territory, and save the compatriots in the Northeast and other battlefields, so as to lay the foundation for lasting peace in the Far East and the world. Finally, they shouted slogans, which resounded through the sky, and their emotions were generous and passionate. After the meeting, a torch parade was held, with more than 20,000 people from more than 500 units of party, government, military, and civilian organizations participating. They shouted slogans along the way, and the citizens watched on both sides of the road. (Telegram on the 19th)

Declaration of the Communist Party

Chongqing - Zhou Enlai, the Communist Party liaison officer stationed in Chongqing, wrote an article in the Xinhua Daily on the anniversary of the tenth anniversary of the Northeast Incident, declaring the Chinese Communist Party's determination to continue fighting until Japan is driven across the Yalu River into Korea. Zhou stated that "the Communist Party will not be discouraged by the current sweeping and encirclement in the border areas of Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar provinces." A news report carried in the Communist Party's mouthpiece Xinhua Daily claimed that the anti-Japanese armed forces in Manchuria numbered nearly 400,000, slightly more than a quarter of the regular army of the "People's Revolutionary Army." The newspaper claimed that the "People's Revolutionary Army" had twelve divisions, distributed in four "military regions." These military regions were in Eastern Liaoning, Eastern Jilin, Southern Jilin, and Northern Heilongjiang. It was claimed that there were also some Japanese and Koreans in this army, with Koreans accounting for nearly half of the Second Division. There were approximately one thousand Japanese in the Eastern Liaoning military region, fighting against their compatriots in the Kwantung Army. (United Press, 19th)

### War Situation for One Week, September 12th to 18th

Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that today marks the "September 18th" anniversary. The 26th and 25th anniversary both passed in grief. By last year's anniversary, the situation had improved. This year's anniversary has manifested facts of victory, such as the Battle of Dayun Mountain in northern Hunan this week, the recovery of Songbu in northern Jiangxi, the repelling of the Japanese in Dongting Lake, the recovery of Tongshan in southern Hubei, the wounding of the Japanese by the Chinese army in the suburbs of Yichang in western Hubei, and the defection of Liu Changyi's unit in northern Henan. As this holy war enters its fifth year, victories have been achieved everywhere, inflicting fatal wounds on the Japanese. The final victory is not far away. Details are as follows:

Battle of Dayun Mountain

Dayun Mountain in northern Hunan is a base that the Chinese field army often uses to intercept the Yuehan Road's Wuyue section. The Japanese at various points east of Yueyang are constantly attacked by the Chinese, so the Japanese surrounded Dayun Mountain on the 7th in two routes. One route of over a thousand men, attached with a cavalry unit, attacked south from Taolin Xitang on the morning of that day, increasing to over five thousand men in the afternoon, attacking Jiziling and Caoxieling. One route of over a thousand men invaded the area of Chang'an Bridge and Gantian. One route of over a thousand men attacked east from Zhongfang at 1:00 PM, and then increased to over nine thousand men, attacking Nanshan, Yanling, and Yujiaqiao. One route of over three thousand men invaded the Mengcheng Nanchong. After the Japanese on the above two routes joined forces in the northern area of Shenjiashan on the evening of the 8th, they advanced north into the mountain. The Chinese field army drew the Japanese into the mountain and into the mountain passes in the Fangshandong area. The Chinese then used their familiarity with the terrain to turn to the outside line, causing the Japanese to attack in vain. They then counter-encircled the Japanese, launching a heroic annihilation battle from the lines of Zhanjiaqiao, Mengcheng, Caoxieling, and Gantian from midnight on the 8th until dawn on the 11th, killing or wounding approximately 1,400 Japanese and puppet troops. The Japanese were unable to sustain themselves, breaking through the encirclement and retreating in defeat towards Zhongfang and Taolin. The Chinese then recovered the original positions on Dayun Mountain. The Chinese mopping-up troops have been severely attacking the Japanese army in the Gantian Baiyangtian Keji Ridge Binjiatan area for days, capturing many prisoners. With this, the annihilation battle of Dayun Mountain came to an end.

Japanese Harassment in Dongting Lake

On the evening of the 11th, more than a thousand Japanese troops on Liuzhou, a island northwest of Yueyang, forcibly landed, but were contained by the Chinese army. By the morning of the 12th, the Japanese retreated and escaped on Japanese warships. At 3:00 PM on the 12th, another ten Japanese boats, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, sailed to the river surface of the estuary and forcibly landed, and immediately engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese at the west Sanjiaojiao of Xinhekou. By the evening of the 13th, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and again fled back to the Japanese boats, escaping towards Chenglingji. On the morning of the 14th, another three Japanese warships invaded the Huyu Lake from Yueyang and shelled the shore, but were suppressed by the Chinese artillery, and the Japanese were unable to succeed, retreating towards Yueyang in the afternoon.

Recovery of Songbu in Northern Jiangxi

The Japanese in northern Jiangxi, in order to attack the Chinese field army, gathered more than a thousand men and on the morning of the 3rd, made two routes, and forcibly crossed the south from Tielong Pass and Xiang Huangjia Zhou. On the 4th, Songbu fell. On the 6th, the Chinese once overcame Songbu, but the Japanese sent reinforcements to counterattack, repelling the Chinese and occupying the Longxiao area, and engaged in battle with the Japanese. On the morning of the 9th, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack, and the Japanese were defeated towards Anyi, and Songbu was once again recovered. In this battle, more than 700 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and many spoils of war were seized.

Recovery of Tongshan in Hubei

Tongshan is an important stronghold east of the northern section of the Yuehan Road, and the hub of transportation between Hunan and Hubei. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Tongshan City on the evening of the 14th with careful planning. By midnight, all routes had reached the city walls and immediately rushed into the city, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese. By the morning of the 15th, the Japanese forces were unable to sustain themselves and immediately broke through the encirclement and retreated north in defeat. The Chinese then completely recovered the city, while the Japanese at Nanlinqiao, upon hearing the news, rushed to Tongshan for reinforcements, but were intercepted by the Chinese, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. In this battle, the Chinese won a complete victory, killing or wounding seven to eight hundred Japanese soldiers and seizing countless spoils of war.

Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Yichang

The Japanese gathered more than a thousand men in the Meizi'e, Fengbaoshan, and Chadianzi areas northeast of Yichang and attacked the Bagua Temple near Guanzhuangchang on the morning of the 13th. The Chinese immediately engaged them in battle, and the Japanese sent reinforcements to attack the Chinese fiercely, but were repelled by the Chinese. In this battle, more than three hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded.

Defection of Liu's Unit in Northern Henan

Liu Changyi, commander of the Northern Henan Pacification Army, has a force of more than 30,000 men, making him the most powerful force among the Japanese troops on the roads. The unit is stationed in the areas of Qinyang Boai Mengxian Bu Zhi Qingyuan, etc. Recently, they killed the Japanese-appointed advisor Colonel Masaya Ichi, Ikai Shojo, and other officers and soldiers. After capturing Xuan Wen Village and Banhekou, they changed their flag and defected, and their troops immediately attacked the local Japanese, one unit recovered Wenxian, and another unit repelled the Japanese at Dasima, and are now attacking the nearby Japanese fiercely.

### Sichuan Silk Production Increase Plan Completed

Chongqing - Business circles here have recently spread rumors that the UK and the US will purchase Sichuan silk in large quantities to make up for the shortage of Japanese silk, which has greatly stimulated those in the silk industry. Sichuan silk production has never had accurate statistics. Although there are verifiable figures for the improved planting under the auspices of the Sichuan Silk Industry Company, the company issued 300,000 improved species this year, but farmers are not very enthusiastic about silkworm rearing due to food prices, resulting in extremely poor cocoon yields. According to the company's estimates, only 1,500 dans of silk can be reeled from the autumn silkworms. The company has now drawn up a production increase plan for next year, but it hopes that the Trade Commission will increase purchases, so that the same 300,000 improved species can be expected to increase, yielding more than 3,000 dans of silk in the spring and more than 50 million dans of silk in the autumn. Recently, the company's capital increased from 8 million to 12 million yuan. (Havas, 19th)

### Random Talks on the European War (VIII) (2) The Offense and Defense of Blitzkrieg

Motorization, as well as the use of airplanes and tanks, has become the backbone of blitzkrieg tactics. In addition, there are many ancillary necessities, such as (1) using wireless communication to connect rapidly advancing units, (2) using brief, clear code to transmit military orders (although this has the possibility of aiding the enemy, the rapid changes of the battle situation may prevent the enemy from applying it in time), (3) using paratroopers and infantry to descend from the air to disrupt the enemy's rear, and (4) large-scale deployment of smoke screens.

Smoke screens are usually not used to cover the German army's own actions, but are deployed towards the enemy army, making it impossible for them to distinguish targets. Although all of these elements are important, the main body of the German army's charge is still based on using tanks as the head of a spear, using motorized units as the shaft of the spear, and using infantry as the body to wield the spear forward. This is the full picture of blitzkrieg.

If blitzkrieg tactics are as described above, then how should one resist blitzkrieg? Resisting blitzkrieg tactics has two basic elements. First, the enemy's spearhead must be split, or its connection with the wielder must be severed. Second, the spearhead must be blunted, and the situation must be maintained until the defending army can use its own spearhead, that is, launch a counterattack. The first step of this counterattack is to separate the enemy tank units from the motorized infantry units; if this is not possible, the motorized units must be separated from the infantry following on foot. Tank units alone can never achieve final victory. Tank units accompanied only by small squads of motorized infantry cannot hold the positions they have captured.

A blitzkrieg defense line must be like a sieve, allowing some parts to pass through like fish escaping the net (because these parts cannot be intercepted on a single defense line, and because these parts cannot win independently), but the other parts of the attacking army must be intercepted, so that they cannot pass through the sieve.

In other words, a blitzkrieg defense line must be like a spider web, entangling mobile units that touch the web, causing them to rush wildly in the web until they are crushed. Cutting off the fuel and various supplies for tanks and motorized infantry is also an element of this defensive tactic.

This blitzkrieg defense method is different from "defense in depth." Defense in depth is a series of parallel defense lines, and if one line is broken or encircled by the enemy's armored units, it loses its effectiveness. A blitzkrieg defense line is different. It is a net-shaped defense line composed of many tank defense islands, with minefields arranged between these defense islands, and each island's firepower protects the others. The net-shaped defense has two layers, one is the main net, and the other is the auxiliary net. The main net is tightly organized and is guarded and fought by regular troops. Behind it is the auxiliary net, which is widespread throughout the country, with wider openings, and is defended by reserves, training units, and the populace.

The main net's defending troops use a division of soldiers to undertake part of the main defense work. They must choose a concealed location as the forward line. The task of the outposts is to scout the enemy's movements and obstruct the enemy's attacks. Behind these outpost lines, there is a "penetration defense zone," which can be guarded by two battalions of infantry. The defenders do not have to hold a line of defense or a series of defense lines, but rather a defense zone of varying sizes that is best suited to resisting tanks. For example, jungles, villages, cliffs, or positions in the middle of harbors that tanks cannot penetrate are all tank defense islands that must be guarded. Defense work is undertaken not only by infantry, but also by various artillery units such as direct-fire guns, anti-aircraft guns, field guns, and medium guns. In some vulnerable locations, landmines are laid. These minefields must be connected to each other along the areas within range of each island's firepower.

Landmines for defending against tanks are often overlooked, just like other inexpensive weapons that are not used well. However, every ordinary German army division carries 13,000 of these landmines, even when attacking, to defend their own positions when encountering enemy counterattacks. A minefield with 12,000 landmines laid in an area is more effective than the same number of shells fired by a division's artillery units. To create a fire net with 13,000 shells over a four-mile-long position, all of them must be fired within an hour. This fire net can destroy at most 5% of the enemy's attacking tanks. A minefield can last longer and is more effective. Even if there is a gap in the minefield, the defenders can concentrate artillery fire on the gap to prevent enemy tanks from taking advantage of it, and they can try to lay more mines at night to seal it off.

The number of defenders on each defense island varies. Half a company of infantry can hold a jungle, a company of infantry and four field guns can hold a village, and a battalion of infantry, twelve field guns, and four medium guns can hold a town. Each island's defense can respond to all directions, and the food and military supplies they hold must be sufficient for several days of independent combat. Each island must use firepower to cover neighboring islands, and must fire equal firepower to the front, back, left, and right.

These defense islands are easier to camouflage than the usual straight-line positions. Although some parts of a straight-line position are concealed, the unmasked parts will still expose the entire line. As for net-shaped defense zones, they are usually deeply concealed, giving the defense islands invisibility, which is an essential element of modern defensive tactics.

The "penetration defense zone" is three to four miles deep, and behind it needs one or two rear guard lines, which can be filled by drawing some reserves from each brigade. These rear guard lines are used to protect artillery units outside the defense islands, and must protect the ordnance transport trains, supply depots, and division headquarters. It must prevent a small number of enemy soldiers from infiltrating between the outpost and the defense islands, and must especially guard against them sneaking in at night. It must also protect the division's rear from attacks by enemy airborne troops. In addition, it must prepare to defend newly established defense islands, and protect immobile cannons and supplies when enemy armored units launch fierce attacks.

When this infantry division encounters a fierce enemy attack, how exactly should it respond? Each defense island can block tanks, at least the terrain and landmines can do something similar. Enemy armored units attacking them are just sacrificing time and tanks in vain. The attacking army can use smoke screens to cover some defense islands, and use cannons and bombers to concentrate attacks on other defense islands, so that tanks can avoid the fire net of each island and quickly pass through. Each defense island is full of guns and cannons, like a hedgehog covered in spikes. Enemy tanks pay the price to pass through the minefield. By the time they reach the rear guard line, the defenders there have swarmed up to form new hedgehog-like defense islands. The enemy tanks pay the price to pass through, but what about the units following behind them?

If these tanks break through a straight-line defense in the same way, the defenders of that line will lose contact with each other on the left and right, and their rear will be surrounded, forcing them to retreat. If they do not retreat and still try to hold out, then the enemy can use aircraft and mobile artillery to concentrate firepower and bombard this clear target, making them unable to fight back, and enemy motorized infantry can follow the tanks forward.

But defense islands are not so easy to pass through. The defenders of each island have all-round defense capabilities. They have no flanks, and no front or back, so they are not afraid of encirclement. They are originally prepared to be surrounded, so being surrounded is not a concern. Even if one defense island falls, it will not affect the overall situation.

They can destroy enemy tanks as much as possible, and at the same time, they can be on guard against enemy motorized infantry following up. As soon as the enemy infantry follows up, they can carry out their main task, destroying enemy troop carriers, forcing the enemy soldiers to get out of the vehicles, and turning the blitzkrieg unit into a snail's pace.

What if these tanks cannot pass through, and stay in the "penetration defense zone," trying to assist the infantry in advancing? The defenders' direct-fire gunners often do not have enough time to destroy the tanks before they get too close. Now that the enemy tanks are staying within the fire line, and cannot use their speed, the direct-fire guns can freely inflict heavy damage on them, protected by trees, walls, ditches, or minefields.

If the enemy tanks cannot rush past at top speed, then their main task is considered a failure. But if they are able to rush through as quickly as possible, then the motorized infantry following behind them must be forced to dismount and use old tactics to attack these defense islands one by one.

Suppose these motorized units actually pass through the defense net in transport vehicles, under the cover of smoke screens, or due to the destruction of some defense islands. The defense net has sufficient flexibility, and can still combine forces to block the infantry advancing on foot behind them completely, or reduce their speed to a snail's pace. The so-called flexibility of the defense net is due to the fact that each larger defense island can send out some defenders to launch local counterattacks. These counterattacks are carried out by non-armored units against armored units, hoping to restore the original line, which is difficult to achieve during the day. These counterattacks are very effective against enemy non-armored units. As for counterattacking enemy tank units, it is better to do it at night, because at that time the tanks mostly need to rest, and if the enemy infantry can be prevented from going forward to cover them, these tanks will become turtles in a jar.

As for the defending army's tank units launching counterattacks, they should not use small numbers to attack large numbers, but should also use the strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak. The defenders should use armored units and fast infantry units to bypass the enemy's non-armored units and intercept the enemy's ammunition, fuel, and food supplies. The defenders must use a small number of aircraft to seize air superiority over the battlefield, and at the same time send out the remaining aircraft to attack the enemy's airfields and destroy its nearby air power.

In short, the method of dealing with blitzkrieg is nothing more than two points: first, eliminate the enemy's speed of movement to blunt its edge; second, launch counterattacks with firepower and mobility to achieve final victory. (The End)

### Finance: Black Market Foreign Exchange -- Elusive and Vague; Problems upon Problems, Unresolved, It Becomes the Blackest of Black; Difficulties upon Difficulties, A Slight Misstep Becomes Profit upon Profit

Recently, it has been heard that importers of non-essential goods, finding it difficult to obtain foreign exchange, are seeking alternative methods, attempting to transfer funds through exporters. That is, Exporter A, instead of going through the Shanghai Bank to receive foreign exchange earnings from overseas, directly remits funds to Importer B for their desired goods. Meanwhile, in Shanghai, they settle accounts with Exporter A using legal tender at black market rates or slightly higher rates than the HSBC quotation. In this way, instead of settling with the 14 designated banks at the official exchange rate, Exporter A finds it more profitable to settle with the non-essential goods importer at the black market rate. Importers can also obtain foreign exchange that they would not otherwise have access to. Isn't this a win-win for both importers and exporters? This black market issue is a major focal point. If the following problems cannot be resolved, the black market cannot be eliminated; it will simply be renamed and rebranded, creating another opportunity for profit.

(1) The Difficulty in Eliminating the Black Market:

(1) If banks other than the 14 designated banks have US dollar deposits abroad and are able to obtain approval to engage in export financing, using foreign exchange earned from exports to offset the foreign exchange needed for imports, will the black market for foreign exchange still exist? This is the first question.

(2) If the 14 designated banks are allowed to transfer foreign exchange deposited by their clients, it will be difficult to eradicate black market foreign exchange transactions. This is the second question.

(2) For goods for which the Exchange Stabilization Fund provides foreign exchange, the foreign exchange can be obtained at an exchange rate of 5.3125 yuan. However, is there a guarantee that the subsequent selling price of these goods will still be based on the exchange rate at the time of settlement? If a firm guarantee cannot be obtained, it will only provide merchants with an opportunity to profit, and the meaning of stabilizing prices will be lost. Does the Exchange Stabilization Fund have a proper solution to this problem? (Note: This problem should target commodities other than rice, as foreign exchange for rice must be subject to government rice sales.)

(3) Although the volume of US dollar trading in Shanghai is not very large, its existence serves as a benchmark for open black market prices. Measures should be taken to ban it to achieve the absolute elimination of the black market. However, the talk of using US banknotes to replace US currency is rampant. Will this become a disguised form of black market foreign exchange?

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the central bank's quoted rate. The HSBC quoted rate for US dollars decreased by 0.03125, to 5.28125 yuan. The quoted rate for British pounds decreased by 0.0625, to 10.5625 yuan. Otherwise, the HSBC small counter's exchange rate between British and American currencies was flat. In the black market, Chinese speculators were mostly bullish, bidding at 5 yuan, but there were no counterparties. As a result, even though there were settlements for sugar, the banks did not allow transfers. Importers of non-essential foreign goods were inquiring and speculating at prices around 4.75 yuan. Due to a lack of people to take responsibility, the huge bullish and bearish positions of Chinese merchants will have to wait until the end of this month for the Exchange Stabilization Fund to announce settlement measures. Yesterday's prices were 2 shillings and 8.125 pence for British pounds and 4.75 yuan for US dollars.

### Fluctuations in Spot Gold Narrow

Yesterday's spot gold market, after the decision made at the meeting the day before to use the Hong Kong exchange rate as the new standard for settlement starting October 1 (details to be reported separately), resulted in the conclusion of existing October futures contracts. Market prices were stagnant, fluctuating between 6,885 yuan and 6,900 yuan, ultimately closing 5 yuan higher. The total transaction volume decreased further to around 400 taels. The spot price shifted from weak to firm, with smaller fluctuations. The first transaction saw Zhongxing selling 20 taels to Xianghe at a price of 9,020 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan. Later, Litai sold 50 taels each to Xianghe, Xiangxing, and Yong at 9,030 yuan. Xianghe then purchased 40 taels from Litai and 10 taels from Defu, all at 9,030 yuan. Defu continued to sell 10 taels to Hesheng at 9,020 yuan, then sold 20 taels to Zhongxing at 9,030 yuan, and then sold 10 taels to Hexiang at 9,010 yuan. Chengda sold 10 taels to Hexiang, and Dafeng sold 90 taels to Chengji at 9,000 yuan. A securities firm sold 10 taels to a certain gold shop at 8,990 yuan. By noon, the price had rebounded. Xinfeng, Yongjin, and Defu each purchased 10 taels, and Hongqing and Yongjin each purchased 10 taels from Chengda. The noon closing price was 9,010 yuan. In the afternoon, Xiangxing and Yongjin suddenly made aggressive purchases, with the price gradually increasing. They first purchased 10 taels each from Yifeng and Chengda at 9,010 yuan, then purchased 20 taels from Decheng at 9,015 yuan, purchased 40 taels from Yifeng, 20 taels from Xianghe, and 10 taels from Zhongxing, all at 9,020 yuan. Defu also purchased 20 taels from Chengji, all at 9,050 yuan. At 3:30 PM, there were buyers at 9,070 yuan, 20 yuan higher than the previous day, with a high-low range of 80 yuan and a transaction volume of 500 taels. The gold shops' listed price for bullion was 9,100 yuan, 200 yuan lower than the buying price. The price of gold ornaments also fell before rebounding to the same level, remaining at 930 yuan.

Futures Contracts Concluded

The opening price for October futures contracts (each tael weighing ten liang) was 6,900 yuan, with Tianyuan first purchasing 20 taels from Xianghe at 9:15 AM. Mingfeng, Defu, and Yifeng sold, causing the price to fall to 6,885 yuan. It was then bought by Renchengyong, Hesheng, and Tianyuan, raising it by 10 yuan. The noon closing price was 6,895 yuan. In the afternoon, Tianyuan continued to buy, raising the price by 3 yuan to 6,898 yuan, before becoming quiet. At 3:30 PM, Hesheng purchased 10 taels from Chida, and the closing price was 6,900 yuan, 5 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price, with a high-low range of 15 yuan. Trading was extremely light, with mostly liquidations.

The Price of Gold Ornaments Struggles to Fall

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at the Dahongxing and Xintongxing stores was flat in the morning. At noon, the listed price decreased slightly by 10 yuan, to 920 yuan. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, the price rebounded to 930 yuan (the buying price decreased by 50 yuan).

### Resurgence of the US Dollar Surge

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw relatively stable prices for British and American pounds and British pound notes. The market price was flat. US dollar notes once rose to 22.6 yuan, finally settling at 22.4 yuan, still up 0.2 yuan from the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong dollar notes increased slightly, and the market price rose slightly by 0.05 yuan. Japanese yen notes fell back by 0.02 yuan, retreating to 2.26 yuan in the evening. Korean notes continued to rise sharply, reaching 2.04 yuan in the evening.

### Spot Gold Futures: Hong Kong Exchange Rate to Be Used for Settlement Starting in October

Since the spot gold market in the city encountered settlement problems, resulting in a lack of progress, it was decided to use the HSBC small counter US dollar exchange rate and the black market US dollar exchange rate to create a new settlement price. Recently, the black market exchange rate has also been eliminated, and the new conversion standard has been lost, leading to an unprecedented drop in daily trading volume. In view of this, the industry has repeatedly discussed and decided that all outstanding October contracts must be automatically settled by the end of this month. From October 1, the Hong Kong exchange rate will be formally adopted as the standard for settlement, and new trading will begin. At the same time, the association will continue to charge a commission of 1 yuan per contract and a security deposit of 1,000 yuan per contract. It is understood that the Hong Kong exchange rate is operated by the gold and silver industry market in Hong Kong, and the daily fluctuations in price are generated from this. The notice is copied below:

(1) 140 Hong Kong dollars equals one ounce of pure gold. One ounce equals 0.9953 Shanghai market tael. Each spot gold contract in Shanghai weighs 10 Shanghai market taels, with a purity of 99.2 (equivalent to 9 liang and 9 qian and 2 fen of pure gold in Shanghai market taels). Therefore, each spot gold contract is worth 1399.40 Hong Kong dollars when converted to Hong Kong dollars.

(2) 1395.40 Hong Kong dollars will now be adopted as the new standard for calculating the spot gold settlement price (to replace the previous fixed value of 348.25 yuan in US dollars).

(3) At the end of each month, the settlement price will be based on the Hong Kong closing rate of the Hong Kong Silver Industry Market on the day before the end of the month (the amount of Hong Kong dollars converted from every thousand yuan of legal tender) minus 1395.40 yuan. This will give the settlement price for spot gold. For example, if the Hong Kong closing rate of the Hong Kong Silver Industry Market on the day before the end of the month is 173 Hong Kong dollars per thousand yuan of legal tender, then, according to the above calculation method, the spot gold price should be 8,065.9 yuan. The calculation formula table example is copied below.

### Yarn and Cotton: Blue Phoenix Fills Short Positions; Shuangma Speculation Expected to Be Bullish Again; Futures Month Leads to Larger Increase

The yarn market is still fluctuating and uncertain, with trends rising and falling unexpectedly, making it difficult to grasp. Although current yarn trading lacks large-scale development, Hong Kong merchants' purchases have shown significant signs of activity. Today, 200 pieces were shipped. At the same time, news reports indicated an improvement in the situation, so the bulls were slightly excited. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,742 yuan, and the low price was 1,733 yuan. The afternoon opened flat. News then emerged that the Blue Phoenix standard for the current month in the exchange broke through the 500 yuan mark in the morning, triggering profit-taking by short sellers, and the market price slowly rebounded, regaining the 500 yuan level. Everyone believed that the speculative wind had passed, and some were selling out their goods, fearing that the market would improve. As a result, there were many buyers on the platform, and the price rose to 1,745 yuan. It once saw some turbulence, but by the close, the momentum suddenly tightened, rising to 1,752 yuan, and the closing price was 1,751 yuan. Everyone expects the market to open high again today.

Shuangma opened in the morning, carrying over the speculative momentum from the previous afternoon. The opening price was 1,733 yuan. As soon as this price appeared, buyers flocked in, and the price quickly rose to 1,736-7 yuan. News then emerged that the exchange opening was unchanged, and the second opening dropped, bringing a dullness to people's hearts. The price rose to 1,742 yuan and immediately fell back to between 1,727 and 1,728 yuan, fluctuating up and down for a long time. By the time of closing, there was no major change, and it seemed like a situation of stalemate. The final price was 1,739 yuan. The half-day transaction volume totaled 8,680 bales. The amount bought by each group is listed on the left.

Hong Kong: 181 Domestic: 8,500

Total: 8,680

The Shuangma futures market was weak but trending upward, still stuck in a state of hesitation. The sentiments of each group changed from confusion to slightly more lively, with a slight interest in purchasing, especially in the afternoon. The opening of the morning market was affected by the further drop in American cotton by 19 to 22 points, so factory orders opened rather weak. The futures prices followed with small decreases, and the platform showed weakness. The opening price for September contracts was 1,657 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan. The price for October contracts was 1,668 yuan, and the opening was unchanged. The price for November contracts was 1,674 yuan, with a drop of 3.5 yuan. With factory orders rising, scattered short positions made small efforts to cover, and the price rose by 3-5 yuan, but because the downstream was weak in the exchange, sellers suddenly increased their efforts, causing the market to fall back. The noon closing was mixed, with recent contracts improving by 0.5 yuan, October contracts decreasing by 1.5 yuan, and the deferred contracts decreasing by 1 yuan. In the afternoon, the market continued to slowly rise in rotation, seeming to reveal an edge of firmness, and the rise in factory orders inevitably caused short covering, especially with recent contracts showing great strength, making buyers more cautious. As a result, the September contract closed at 1,662 yuan, rebounding by 3 yuan. The October contract closed at 1,668 yuan. The November contract was higher due to the final closing, closing at 1,684 yuan, with a standalone improvement of 6.5 yuan. A table of transaction prices is listed below.

### Raw Indian Cotton of the Twentieth Count Reaches Successive Peaks

The New York cotton market initially fell due to large-scale short selling by Southern brokers, and continued to decline due to further selling in New Orleans and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, closing prices were down approximately 18 to 24 points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was unstable and mixed, initially rising due to speculator buying and short covering, but subsequently falling again due to mass selling and profit-taking by bulls. Yesterday's closing prices were up or down about 1 to 2 rupees. It is also predicted that the market outlook will be bearish by 1.75 rupees at the opening today.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade continues to wait and see on fixed-price transactions, as the foreign exchange settlement issue has not been fully resolved.

The current cotton situation is once again tight. Everyone believes that the exchange application will result in speculative gains. Secondly, the poor weather conditions this year have resulted in a poor cotton harvest. The industry has unanimously turned its attention to a bullish outlook. As a result, the price of coarse cotton is rising steadily, and there is widespread enthusiasm for hoarding and purchasing raw materials for the 20-count flower printing, resulting in prices breaking new peaks every day.

### Grains: Small Sieved Siamese Rice as a Speculative Target - Sharp Increase of Three to Four Yuan -

Yesterday, foreign rice was initially flat, then fell, and then rose sharply again. At the opening of the morning market, there were only two flat offers, and the market did not rise or fall. Some bullish investors, seeing that the market had been lifeless for days, settled at this flat price. As the selling pressure increased, small sieved rice fell from 103.5 yuan to 100 yuan. However, the price decline immediately attracted new bullish buyers. There was also a real consumption demand after the holidays, and inventory surveys by the local stacks showed a slight decrease compared to last week. Furthermore, rumors of favorable international changes circulated in the market, and buying interest surged, with prices rising rapidly. Small sieved rice and No. 2 Siamese rice were particularly active as traders focused on the exchange. Small sieved rice in the bank stacks opened at 102 yuan and later reached 105 yuan. The price in the foreign stacks ranged from 102.5 yuan to 104.5 yuan, while No. 2 Siamese selected rice rebounded from 100 yuan to 103 yuan, a sharp increase of 3-4 yuan compared to before the holidays. Other goods were unable to withstand the pressure of real sales and only rose by about 2 yuan. No. 1 Saigon high-quality rice was priced at 117 yuan, with large bags at 116 yuan and 115.5 yuan, medium grade at 114 yuan, and Min brand broken rice at 113.5 yuan and 107-108 yuan, with broken tips at 78 yuan to 75.5 yuan. The remaining goods were mixed in price and could not be traded openly. As for the inventory in Shanghai stacks, it is currently estimated to be 1,139,596 bags, 60,158 bags less than the previous period. Yinghua Company's small sieved road rice was priced at 131 yuan to 133 yuan, currently at 130 yuan, with broken rice at 86 yuan, with a transaction volume of 500-600 tons. There are currently over 30,000 bags of fresh rice.

The market for thick and thin japonica rice was quite mixed yesterday. As the arrival of early rice from South Port was scarce, local store sales saw foreign rice soaring in price, so demand was strong. For a while, supply could not meet demand, and sellers immediately took advantage of the situation, so the selling price rose sharply by 4-5 yuan. Special rice opened at 151 yuan, and the large bags ranged from 150 yuan to 149 yuan. The lack of goods in the market for thick japonica rice from Wuxi led to high-quality goods being sold at 152 yuan. As for new japonica rice from Pudong, its quality was weak and unsuitable for direct consumption, and it had the opposite result, with the market color declining and the price falling by 1-2 yuan. Special rice opened at 191 yuan, ordinary rice at 150 yuan, and second grade at 188.5 yuan.

The glutinous rice market was now a good fit and scarce of goods, so prices generally rose. The selling price also improved by 1-2 yuan. Special Hong Kong Yuan opened at 127-128 yuan, with large bags ranging from 125-126 yuan to 120 yuan. Glutinous green beans were priced at 112-113 yuan.

### Flour Sales Are Not Bad

The consumption of foreign flour is not declining, and the market has remained stable. Although foreign rice has fallen sharply, flour prices have not been affected. Yesterday, rumors of rising rice prices triggered renewed interest from customers and increased demand from consumers, so the market price gradually increased. Kan brand Jinlong Dong stack opened at 30.09 yuan, then rose to 31.1 yuan, and closed at 31.15 yuan in the afternoon. The West stack opened at 30.02 yuan in the early market and rose to 30.05 yuan in the afternoon. The price of American brand Pao Tai flour was 32.5 yuan, Banana brand weighed 32.3 yuan, and Australian brand Bell Tower flour was 32.7-8 yuan, all rebounding by 3-5 yuan from the previous closing, with a transaction volume of approximately 26,000-27,000 bags. There is limited local flour production. The price returned to 34.2 yuan. Bran was out of the market but also showed strength due to the shortage of goods. There was limited wheat inventory, and the market was firm. Factory purchase prices remained unchanged.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Begin to Rebound, Foreign Stocks See Increased Demand

The over-the-counter market for public bonds saw the upward momentum suppressed yesterday. Class C bonds made a modest effort to reach a high price of 72.9 yuan, just 5 fen higher than the previous day. 73 yuan was just 1 jiao short, and there was no strength to keep rising. The bulls seemed to be feeling that prices were too high, relying entirely on the bulls to pull them up at any time; otherwise, they would be lost at any moment. Yesterday, the bulls were still buying, but their strength seemed to be weakening. Hengkang, Xinfu, and Yitai bought in the morning, and the rise leveled off slightly after the opening. Class C bonds reached a high price of 72.9 yuan, but then retreated by 2-3 jiao due to the massive selling by Runtong Shengda. In the afternoon, Yitai continued to buy, and Jiufeng and Hongda also absorbed some, but the selling pressure was stronger, and Runde continued to sell off. Dingkang, Shuntai, and Huhu Ji also sold off. Class C bonds saw a low price of 2 yuan and 3 jiao. Although the closing price rebounded by 1-2 jiao, it was not stable. As a result, all bonds rebounded by a small amount, ranging from 1-2 jiao to 5.5 jiao. The transaction volume was approximately 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

The stock market saw 100 shares of Bank of Communications stock traded at a price of 104.5 yuan. The stock market at the Public Trading Center saw a sharp turn upward, with several well-known stocks reaching new highs. Trading was extremely active. At the close, industrial stocks had a very good underlying momentum, while rubber stocks showed a downward trend.

### North-South Goods: New Red and Black Dates Sold at First Opening

Since the new goods of government red dates have come to market, the first batch has been sold. The 81 packages of those with bright color and firm flesh were priced at 75 yuan at the auction and sold for 80 yuan, selling out completely. In addition, over 140 packages of new Cangzhou red dates opened at 65-75 yuan. Since the goods were riddled with wormholes, they were not welcomed by customers. If the subsequent batches do not improve, they may not sell. The twenty packages of new black Jiyang dates with high-quality fruit opened at 165 yuan. The thirty packages of high-quality fruit opened at 170 yuan and sold out completely.

### Metals: Black Iron Billets Listed at 5,000 Yuan

Recently, the sales and demand for 2,000-pound black iron billets have been sluggish, and the market atmosphere has softened. However, the industry still believes that overseas sources will continue to be limited and that the local inventory is low, so there is still a bullish sentiment in the midst of the softening market. The standard price was once offered at 5,500 yuan, but gradually fell to 5,400 yuan, 5,200-300 yuan. The market yesterday saw the price fall to just over 5,000 yuan due to sluggish sales. The downward trend shows the mentality of those holding the goods. Yesterday, the transaction volume was 30-40 bundles, sold to the local thermos bottle factory, printing factory, and billet factory. The transaction price was around 5,000 yuan.

### An Opportunity Rare in Several Hundred Years: A Partial Solar Eclipse Visible Tomorrow Afternoon; The Total Eclipse Zone Crosses Over 3,000 Miles; The Sky Will Darken and Lose Color, Like Night

According to the announcement from the Xujiahui Observatory, people in various parts of China will witness an interesting solar eclipse this Sunday, the 21st of this month. It will begin at 10:02 AM and end at 2:58 PM. The total eclipse zone will pass through all of China, from the northwest to the southeast. Its path will pass near the south of Hankou, run through Nanchang, slightly north of Fuzhou, and continue through northern Taiwan, cross the Pacific Ocean, and end at Guam. Because the current meteorological conditions in southeastern China are very unfavorable, the observations made in Fujian will generally not be satisfactory. The observation locations in Gansu and Russia are expected to be the most favorable. The average width of the total eclipse zone is about 135 kilometers. What can be seen in Shanghai is not a total eclipse. However, at the maximum eclipse, which is at 1:30 PM (summer time), 92% of the sun's surface will be obscured by the moon's shadow. At that time, the sky will be darkened and lose color, almost like night. If it is clear and cloudless at this time, first magnitude stars can be seen twinkling in the sky. Unfortunately, the spectacular sights of the solar corona and solar prominences will not be visible.

Two Methods of Observation with the Naked Eye

For those observing the solar eclipse with the naked eye, it is best to use ordinary binoculars covered with black glass similar to that used on marine sextants. Smoked glass can also be used to observe the solar eclipse. According to the Da Zhong News Agency, if you want to capture the solar eclipse on camera, you must use binoculars, remove the camera lens, and replace it with binoculars. As for the exposure time, it can only be obtained through experience. We can record the correct times of the beginning and end of the solar eclipse. This point can help astronomers verify theories related to the movement of the sun and moon. This time must be accurate to one-tenth of a second, and measurement is not easy, because the moon itself is not visible, and only the jagged edge of the sun caused by the moon can be used to determine the moment of contact between the two celestial bodies.

Changes in Radio Waves Can Be Measured

The changes in climate and atmospheric pressure on the ground can be observed by measuring the strength of reflections from the Earth. However, this type of measurement is difficult to achieve in cities due to the obstruction of tall buildings. During a solar eclipse, changes in shortwave radio waves can be observed (referring to radio waves shorter than 100 meters), because these radio waves are entirely propagated to various places through the continuous reflection of the differentiated upper atmosphere. The ionization of this upper atmosphere is due to the sun's radiation. This reflective force undergoes a significant change during a solar eclipse. The state of radio waves can also be measured during a solar eclipse. However, the power station must be very far away to avoid the influence of other lightning surges. The sensitivity of the receiving station must be kept constant. If automatic power control is used, there is no problem. At the same time, the power supply must be continuous. However, this action is quite difficult during a solar eclipse due to the sudden darkness. When measuring, attention must be paid to the elapsed time of the solar eclipse and the increase or decrease in the signal strength at that time, as well as whether it is rhythmic.

Solar Eclipse Lecture Held Today

Tomorrow's solar eclipse is an opportunity that has not been seen in hundreds of years since the Jiajing Dynasty of the Ming Dynasty in our country. The local observatory and youth associations will all make precise observations at that time, and astronomers from all over the country have gone to Fujian one after another in advance. According to the measurement of the National Meteorological Observatory, the time of tomorrow's solar eclipse is around noon, and the places that will pass through it are Chong'an, Fuding, Jiujiang, Daye Xiangyang, Wuchang, Hankou, Shanyang, Baoji, Lanzhou, and Xining for a total length of more than 3,500 kilometers, as well as Toksu in Soviet Russia. Shanghai will see a partial eclipse. As for the observation location, southern Fujian is the clearest. In addition to the observatory making precise observations on that day, the Shanghai Youth Association has also scheduled a solar eclipse lecture for 4:00 PM today to prepare for tomorrow's observation of the solar eclipse.

Shanghai Observatory to Conduct Electromagnetic Observations

According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory, the observatory will be equipped with an electromagnetic observation device tomorrow to observe the atmospheric pressure and temperature during the solar eclipse and its possible changes. According to astronomical experts, the more important aspects of observing a solar eclipse include (1) photographing the entire activity movie of the solar eclipse, (2) measuring the brightness of the sky during the eclipse, (3) accurately measuring the time of contact, and (4) observing meteorological aspects such as air temperature and pressure during the solar eclipse. Attention should also be paid to observing the movement of the solar shadow and the observation of binary star beads. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Zhijiang University professor Xu Lu, invited by the Youth Association (Baxianqiao), will give a lecture on the principles.

### Fifty Foreigners Withdraw from Japan to Shanghai

On the 18th, at 2:30 PM, the Japanese ship "Shanghai Maru" arrived in Shanghai from Japan and docked at the Huishan Wharf. There were a total of 502 passengers, including 50 foreigners who had withdrawn from Japan. It is said that the ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 19th.

### Wireless Communication Interruption Last Night Was Not Related to the Solar Eclipse

Caused by Sunspots

Shanghai has not received any wireless communication since the night of the 18th, leading to a significant reduction in news from news agencies in the city. It is widely believed that the interruption in wireless communication is due to the appearance of sunspots, and has nothing to do with tomorrow's solar eclipse. It is known that sunspots frequently appear, hindering communication.

### US Consulate Attaches Importance to the Detention of the Lux Ship

According to the English-language "China Press," it is said that the Jianghai Customs authorities are still detaining the American ship "Lux" today (the 19th). The Shanghai branch of the American President Lines (which owns the ship) is still in consultation with customs officials regarding the release of the ship, and no conclusion has been reached. No official information regarding the detention has been obtained from either the customs or the President Lines. However, it is said that the US Consulate in Shanghai is closely monitoring the matter, and is expected to intervene if the talks between the President Lines and the customs fail. It is reported that the ship arrived in Shanghai carrying 9,000 barrels of oil for delivery to a Japanese company. However, while the ship was crossing the Pacific, the US government announced a ban on oil transportation. Therefore, after the ship arrived in Shanghai, it could only unload 7,000 barrels of oil in accordance with the new US restrictions. The remaining 2,000 barrels of higher-quality oil were kept on board, and are expected to be transported to Manila. However, the customs authorities did not allow the ship to leave because its manifest did not include any cargo for transit.

### Japanese Side Makes Demands on the Municipal Council's Police Force - Aiming to Expand the Authority of the Japanese Deputy Commissioner - Negotiations Have Already Taken Shape but No Results Yet

Recently, a series of terrorist incidents have occurred in the Settlement. The Japanese side has taken the opportunity to demand that the Municipal Council reform its police administrative structure. According to a brief report from the Japanese Official Domei News Agency, the Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi made representations to the Municipal Council on Wednesday this week, urging the Council to pay attention to the resurgence of terrorist activities. The specific details of the negotiations are not yet known, but it is understood that the Japanese Consulate has urged the Municipal Council authorities to pay attention to the following three points: (1) The number of Japanese people who have been subjected to armed attacks has increased; (2) The Municipal Council's Police Department should give adequate consideration to countermeasures; (3) The structure of the Police Department should be modified in accordance with Japanese ideas to consolidate the position and authority of the Special Deputy Commissioner of Police.

Beginning of Consultations

According to the English-language "China Press," it was learned today (the 19th) from official circles that the Japanese authorities have requested the Municipal Council's Police Department to make a number of important changes. The Council had originally planned to formally appoint Watanabe Seikan as the Japanese Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department to succeed Akagi, who was assassinated in June, but this has now been delayed. It is understood that the Municipal Council began consultations with the Japanese authorities in the city last week regarding a number of changes suggested by the Japanese side, and these will continue this week, but the results may not be decided until next month.

Complex Content

Japanese officials claimed this morning that many issues would be raised and discussed during the consultations, so it was not expected that a result would be achieved soon. A spokesperson for the Municipal Council replied to reporters that such talks had indeed been held, and that they were related to "the appointment and position of Akagi's successor." The spokesperson did not disclose any other details. According to another official source, the Japanese authorities here have requested the Municipal Council to change the police system in the International Settlement, and that the changes sought are "similar to the modifications made by the Municipal Council in setting up a provisional board of directors this year."

Expanding Authority

The Japanese side wants to obtain a better position in the Police Department than it has now, so that a Japanese police officer in the Police Department can take on the task full-time, rather than just appointing a Japanese Deputy Commissioner as a liaison officer. The Japanese proposal seeks to add a Japanese Commissioner to the Police Department, as is the current system in the Shanghai Customs, where Europeans and Japanese hold the same positions. It is said that if the negotiations fail to yield results, Watanabe Seikan will likely assume the post of Deputy Commissioner of Police. Watanabe arrived in Shanghai two months ago to take up his new post, and is currently a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai.

Postal Remittance Negotiations in Eastern Zhejiang

Regarding the recent postal situation in various parts of Eastern Zhejiang: (1) Postal remittances in Ningbo, Shaoxing, Zhuji, and other places are still under negotiation, and it seems difficult to resume remittances in the short term, due to the sluggish remittance business in the aforementioned areas. (2) Small and large postal packages in Eastern Zhejiang cannot be accepted or sent due to the scarcity of maritime flights. However, in order to facilitate merchants and civilians, the Zhejiang Postal Administration has announced the resumption of postal packages to various provinces and cities in the Northwest and West, and all packages to Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other places will be processed as usual.

### Bomb Explodes at Nanjing East Railway Station

According to the Heiminscha News Agency, as reported by the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun," at 3:15 PM on the 17th, a time bomb suddenly exploded in the baggage inspection area inside the Nanjing Railway Station in Shimonoseki, killing and injuring 46 men and women. Japanese soldiers and others immediately took extraordinary precautions in the surrounding area, conducted a major search, and arrested a number of people they considered to be suspects. At the same time, they provided first aid to the injured. In addition to the eight who died on the spot, 34 were sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, and four to the Central Hospital. Among them, 18 had minor injuries and were discharged after being bandaged. The rest were admitted to the hospital. Two in the Central Hospital are still...

### New French Mail Ship Arrives in Shanghai on Maiden Voyage

The French Navigation Company's newest large mail ship, the "Comte de Lile," arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on its maiden voyage from Saigon via Manila. The ship berthed at buoy numbers 11 and 12 in the Huangpu River. The ship arrived with 10,000 bags of corn and 710,000 feet of lumber.

### French Concession to Levy Beverage Tax Starting Next Week

The French Concession authorities will levy a general tax on manufacturers of beverages (whether alcoholic or not) within the Concession, starting next week. According to French officials, the tax was first announced when it was proposed for study in August, and the detailed rules will be announced today.

### Shanghai Investment Capital Shifts Inward, Exceeding Eighty Million Yuan - Wealthy Merchants Deposit Funds and Remit to the Mainland

Since the channeling of Shanghai's investment capital inward, the amount of funds shifted inward since spring has been enormous. In January, it was approximately 10 million yuan. In February and March combined, it was 150 million yuan. April saw the largest amount, approximately 300 million yuan. This was because, due to rumors of US involvement in the war that month, Shanghai merchants remitted surplus profits and deposits to the mainland. May also saw a substantial amount, still around 150 million yuan. In early June, several projects specifically for developing industries amounted to 100 million yuan, and miscellaneous funds totaled more than 50 million yuan. Therefore, the total amount since June has exceeded 850 million yuan. As for the funds remitted from Shanghai to the mainland in the second half of the year, they are even more considerable.

### Political Undercurrents Disturb White Russians - Rifts Emerge - North China Groups Attempt to Expand Influence - Russian Emigrants in this City Express Dissatisfaction

According to the "North China Daily News," the lives of the White Russian emigrants in this city remain outwardly peaceful as before. However, according to inquiries with the police and other sources, there are indeed political rifts within the White Russian community. Furthermore, political groups with headquarters in North China have recently intensified their activities in Shanghai. Sources with inside information claim that the White Russians in Shanghai are greatly disturbed by political undercurrents, and that the recent assassination of Ivanov, chairman of the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Committee, may have been a victim of these political undercurrents.

Political Undercurrents Disturb White Russians

At the same time, it is rumored that someone is trying to mobilize the young White Russians here to engage in anti-communist activities, and that some White Russians in Qingdao have fled the area to avoid being mobilized. It is known that the previous two chairmen of the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Committee, Metzler and Ivanov, were both assassinated within a year of each other. Today, some White Russians in Shanghai are quite concerned about the possible changes in the status of this committee, and believe that someone is trying to merge this committee with the Tianjin White Russian organization, a fact that has been gradually confirmed.

North China's Influence Invades Shanghai

The organization in Tianjin is called an "Anti-Communist Committee." When it was first established several years ago, it was a purely local organization, but it has now developed into a powerful federation with branches in Yantai and Qingdao. The majority of White Russians in Shanghai do not approve of the connection between the committee in this city and the organization in North China, because many White Russians have left North China in the past two years to avoid the organization's arrogance. It has become more difficult for White Russians to escape from North China lately, and Shanghai is considered a refuge for White Russians, where they can make a living without getting involved in politics.

White Russians in Qingdao Forced to Undergo Training

However, it is rumored that someone in Shanghai is now trying to register White Russians residing in Hongkou. It is widely believed that the purpose of the registration is to have these White Russians undergo military training. White Russians in the Public Concession and the French Concession south of the Suzhou Creek have not been subjected to this kind of pressure, for obvious reasons. As for the claim that young White Russians in Qingdao and other places are being forced to register and undergo military training, it has been confirmed by those who have recently arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao and other places. All White Russians who are qualified for military training have been forced to register, and some have already been sent to Tianjin for training, and then reportedly sent to the north to serve in active duty.

Those Who Go to Qingdao for Summer Vacation are Detained

A certain Russian in Shanghai stated yesterday (the 18th) regarding the situation in various ports and resorts in North China that several White Russians from Shanghai who went to Qingdao in early summer have now been detained in the area and cannot return to Shanghai. It is said that when these people set off from Shanghai, they pretended to be Qingdao residents in order to avoid paying the necessary residency fee. Now, in order to avoid being forced to register, it is difficult for them to prove to the relevant authorities in the city that they are actually Shanghai residents who went there for summer vacation. If the White Russian Committee in this city merges with the organization in North China, it will be regarded as a riot.

White Russians in the Settlements Feel Uneasy

This organization has not only usurped judicial and other powers, but is also allowed to collect taxes and impose fines on all Russian emigrants. White Russians in North China have not avoided registering with this organization, because after registering, they can obtain a passport and travel freely without being mistreated. The North China organization has repeatedly tried to gain a solid foothold in Shanghai, but has made little progress. The Russian emigrants residing in the two settlements are still at ease, but they have recently received notice that the White Russians here will be re-registered, which cannot help but make them feel uneasy.

### Stricter Controls on Transit Goods in Rangoon

Since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, the transportation of goods in transit through Rangoon to the free areas of China has been extremely congested. After the China Travel Service telegraphed its Rangoon branch to inquire about the strict control of transit cargo in Rangoon, it has now received a reply stating, "As it concerns the future of cargo transportation, we have inquired with Yunnan Ye for clarification, and received a reply stating that new vehicles have been brought under unified control for the transportation of commercial goods." Subsequently, another telegram was received from the Rangoon branch stating, "The news that transit commercial goods in Rangoon will be subject to strict control in early September is extremely certain." However, the detailed measures will not be fully understood until the Rangoon and Yunnan branches send letters of notification.

### The Case of the Conductor Pushing a Passenger to Death - Fellow Townsmen from Wenzhou Express Support - Requesting Severe Punishment of the Culprit and Generous Compensation for the Family - Ticket Scalping Should Be Strictly Prohibited

On the afternoon of September 13th, our fellow townsman, Mr. Xiang Dongchuan, was pushed and tragically killed by a trolleybus conductor. All Shanghai citizens, whether they knew him or not, felt deeply indignant. Upon hearing the news at that time, this association immediately sent personnel to investigate the scene of the incident, and assisted Mr. Xiang's family in taking care of everything at the Red Cross Hospital and the Leyuan Funeral Home, where the body was examined. We are now planning for the aftermath, so that the deceased can rest in peace and the living will not suffer from hunger and cold. We also deeply hope that this kind of unfortunate event will never happen again in the future, in order to protect the safety of passengers. We also hope that all sectors of society will provide assistance. We will now describe the three points of our association's views below:

Strict Punishment

(1) In the case of conductor Wang Wanxiang pushing and killing Xiang Dongchuan, the murderer was apprehended by the Chengdu Road Police Station and sent to court for trial. A witness, Mr. Jiang Jing (student of St. John's University), testified that at the time, the deceased had indeed paid the fare and was asking the conductor for a ticket, which led to him being pushed and killed. The facts are clear, and it is difficult for the defendant to deny. We deeply hope that the wise court authorities will give a severe judgment to deter others.

Due Compensation Should Be Provided

(2) The deceased, Mr. Xiang Dongchuan, graduated from Peking University in his early years, and was the younger brother of Mr. Xiang Xiang (Wei Sai). He lived a clean life and traveled north and south for nearly 20 years. He was generous and able to help those in need. He spent his salary as soon as he earned it. This time, he died an unnatural death. Although the perpetrator was an unlawful conductor, the tram company's failure to provide adequate training for ticket sales was the main cause of his death. The deceased's family includes an 80-year-old mother, wife, and children, totaling eleven people, who have no means of livelihood. The company authorities should consider the tragic circumstances of the deceased's family and provide generous compensation to appease his spirit.

Rewards and Punishments Should Be Strict

(3) In recent years, the practice of trolleybus conductors in this city engaging in ticket scalping has become rampant. The reason for this is nothing more than the company authorities' meager treatment of ticket sellers and lenient penalties. We deeply hope that the company will improve the treatment of ticket sellers in the future, and that the penalties for scalping should also be revised. If a ticket seller is found to be engaged in scalping, they must be fired immediately and investigated according to the law. They should not simply be fined and let off, which would encourage the practice of scalping. This would ensure that similar incidents do not happen again, which would be a great blessing for the citizens.

### A Bomb Was Thrown into a Japanese Store

In front of a store established by a Japanese person at No. 115 Jing'an Temple Road, at around 5:00 PM yesterday, a man suddenly threw a hand grenade into the store, and it exploded. The person who threw the grenade escaped without a trace. Upon hearing the alarm, the police sent detectives to investigate and took the hand grenade back to the police station for investigation.

### Information on the Jing'an Temple Dispute

Regarding the internal dispute at Jing'an Temple, which has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper, it is now learned that the dispute is becoming increasingly widespread. Yesterday, the monks of the temple, including Zhifang, seeing that the attacks from the outside were very strong and could not be concealed, specially gathered the deceased abbot Zhiwen's friends to the inner room and forced Zhiwen's concubine to move out first. However, they refused to hand over the real estate contract that Zhiwen had given her before, and Dewu and others could do nothing about it. As for Yangxi, he is collecting various pieces of evidence and plans to take photos to submit a report to the outside world. It is also learned that the elders and major patrons of the various mountains and monasteries once gathered at the temple to discuss solutions, but the results were divergent and yielded nothing. As for the Buddhist Association, although the temple is a famous ancient temple, it is difficult to resolve the dispute, so it will not intervene. It was learned yesterday that Dewu, Zhifang, and others from the temple have gathered many people to protect everything inside the temple, which has led to a great decline in the temple's Buddhist activities in recent days.

### "Zhengyan Bao" Celebrates First Anniversary Today

The "Zhengyan Bao," an American-owned newspaper in this city, has reached its first anniversary since its founding. Today is its anniversary, and the newspaper has specially increased its publication with a two-and-a-half-page anniversary special issue. The increased publication is attached to the newspaper and distributed free of charge. In addition to the pictorial, the content also includes essays, such as several special articles on tomorrow's total solar eclipse, which are extremely brilliant.

### Health Association Broadcasts Lecture

The Chinese Health Association has scheduled Ms. Huang Jingwan to give a lecture on "Public Health Workers and Family Visits" at the Gospel Radio Station (frequency 760) at 4:00 PM today. Please tune in on time.

### Miscellaneous News from All Circles

The total solar eclipse, which has caused a global sensation among scholars, will be visible in central China and the Shanghai area this Sunday (September 22nd). It is said that 9/10ths of the sun will be eclipsed in this city. It is reported that the Jingyi Optical Company on Nanjing Road has specially produced deep-colored solar viewing glasses, which make viewing the sun clear and comfortable, and the price is very affordable, making them very suitable for observing the solar eclipse.

Zhu Boqun, a plastic surgery expert, has been the manager of the Daguangming Beauty Salon at No. 17 Jing'an Temple Road for many years. Zhu is a devout Christian and has a great spirit of universal love. This summer, he resigned from his position. He has now chosen to set up his own Daguangming Beauty Salon at No. 350 Mai'ersi Road at the intersection of Huilong Road in the French Concession. All the equipment is modern and the service is attentive.

### A Brief Explanation of Solar Eclipses

— Xu Lu

Professor Xu Lu of Zhijiang University has been studying astronomy for many years and is a leading scholar. Tomorrow (21st) there will be a solar eclipse, and a total eclipse will be visible within China, a rare opportunity in four hundred years. All circles in Shanghai attach great importance to this, so this newspaper has specially invited Mr. Xu to write an article entitled "A Brief Explanation of Solar Eclipses" to share with our readers. Mr. Xu is also scheduled to give a lecture on "The Principles of Solar Eclipses and Methods of Observation" at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge at 4:00 PM this afternoon. We add a note here to introduce him.

Solar eclipses are not a novelty. Mankind has recorded countless solar eclipses since the beginning of history! It is said that the earliest solar eclipse record in our country was found in the oracle bone inscriptions of Yin Ruins, which is more than 4,000 years ago, showing that our Chinese nation has long been paying attention to solar eclipses. However, in the past, there were superstitious beliefs that solar eclipses were the harbinger of disasters. Therefore, when a solar eclipse occurred, people beat drums and gongs, and even set off firecrackers. In the Spring and Autumn Period, there were even rituals to save the sun. The ancients' attention to solar eclipses is evident. Since the rise of science, this view has gradually diminished, but it is a pity that many people still do not understand the principles of solar eclipses, which is regrettable. This article can only briefly explain the superficial theory of solar eclipses. As for the detailed calculation methods and the key points of observing solar eclipses, they cannot be introduced to readers here, because those questions are too complex and too specialized.

To explain the theory of solar eclipses, it is necessary to first explain the movement of various celestial bodies. We see the sun every day during the daytime. The sun is just one of the many celestial bodies closest to us. We see many stars every night, including fixed stars and planets; we sometimes see a moon, which is a satellite orbiting the Earth. Including the Earth we live on, astronomy collectively refers to them as celestial bodies. Celestial bodies cannot remain stationary in space, so the sun and many fixed stars are also moving in space, but they are too distant to measure, so we will not discuss them for now. What we need to pay attention to is the solar system with the sun as the center. In the solar system, assuming that the sun is stationary, there are nine planets orbiting it, and the Earth is the third of the nine planets. The Earth rotates around its axis once every 24 hours, and revolves around the sun once a year along its orbit. The moon revolves around the Earth once a month, while following the Earth around the sun.

Among these three celestial bodies, there is a constant cycle of movement, and sometimes the positions of the three celestial bodies happen to be on a straight line, which becomes a solar eclipse or a lunar eclipse. If the Earth is between the sun and the moon, it becomes a lunar eclipse, because the Earth's shadow blocks the sunlight. If the moon is between the Earth and the sun, it becomes a solar eclipse, because the moon's body blocks the sunlight. Therefore, lunar eclipses must occur on the night of the full moon, while solar eclipses can only occur in the daytime of the new moon. Let us give a simple example: suppose we use an electric light or other light-emitting body as the sun, our head as the Earth, and take a round mirror to replace the moon. Then, when the round mirror is in front of our head, and just on the straight line between our eyes and the light, even though we are facing the electric light, the light is blocked by the round mirror and cannot be seen. This is a symbol of a solar eclipse. When the round mirror is in front of us and we are facing away from the light, we can see the light through the reflection of the mirror surface. However, when our head is on the straight line between the round mirror and the electric light, the shadow of our head blocks the mirror surface, and we cannot see the reflection, which is a symbol of a lunar eclipse.

This explanation is indeed superficial, but it is actually the basic principle of solar and lunar eclipses. However, the three celestial bodies cannot always be on the same straight line, so solar and lunar eclipses are not common. Let us put aside lunar eclipses for now and focus on the issue of solar eclipses. Although solar eclipses are not very rare, total solar eclipses are very difficult to encounter. A total solar eclipse means that the entire sun is completely covered by the lunar body. It can only be seen within the range of the moon's umbral cone. The area is not wide, and it takes nearly four hundred years for one place to experience a total solar eclipse. Therefore, many people have never seen a total solar eclipse in their lives. The remaining types include partial eclipses, in which part of the sun is blocked by the lunar body. They can be seen in the penumbral area outside the moon's umbra, which is a wider range and more frequent opportunity. In addition, there is also an annular eclipse, because the moon is slightly farther from the Earth. Although it completely covers the sun, there is still a halo left around it. The total solar eclipse is the most wonderful, because at that time the colors of the sky and earth change, the atmosphere is gloomy, and it is no wonder that people with immature knowledge are shocked by the impending disaster. However, at this time, various special phenomena such as the solar corona and solar prominences can be seen, which are problems to be studied in astronomy.

In recent times, science has flourished, and the time of solar eclipses and the areas where they can be seen can be accurately calculated in advance. Mr. Li Xiaofang of the Chinese Astronomical Society calculated the detailed information of the total solar eclipse that can be seen in our country on September 21st this year, and it has been published in the 11th issue of the 24th volume of "Science" published in October last year. Now, I will report some of this information to readers. This total eclipse passes through eight provinces in our country: Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang, and then out to sea. The total length is 3,400 kilometers and the duration is about 80 minutes. The total eclipse zone runs from northwest to southeast, with a width ranging from 107 kilometers to 144 kilometers. In many places outside the total eclipse zone, partial eclipses can be seen from Harbin in the north to Qiongya in the south. Shanghai is five degrees of latitude away from the total eclipse zone, which is not very far, and the partial eclipse seen there is slightly less than 90%. The moment when the solar eclipse is most visible in Shanghai is close to 12:40 PM in Central Plains Standard Time, but the initial eclipse can be seen half an hour before, and the complete recovery will not occur until half an hour later. The time in between is very long.

This total solar eclipse is a truly rare opportunity in a hundred years, because on a global scale, although there is an average of 66 total solar eclipses every hundred years, most of them pass over the sea and remote areas of land. According to the proportion of area, a total solar eclipse passing through our country only occurs once every hundred years, and sometimes it is too close to morning or too close to sunset, making observation difficult. Like this year's total solar eclipse, the area it passes through is a densely populated area in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the time of the solar eclipse is close to noon, which only happens twice in 500 years. It is truly a rare opportunity. Unfortunately, the country is in great difficulty and cannot have adequate and full preparations to engage in observation, but I have heard that the Chinese Astronomical Society has already united with various academic institutions and groups to organize a Chinese Solar Eclipse Observation Committee to send teams to observe, and the Fujian Meteorological Institute is also preparing to observe the solar eclipse. If the weather is good, there will definitely be excellent results to be published, and readers can wait and see.

### Previous Night's Assassination Attempt on Japanese Nationals: The Perpetrator Confesses to Firing the Gun; Both Cases Were Committed by These Four Individuals; Fled While Armed, Accidentally Shooting Himself

The Shanghai Times reports that at 9:50 PM on Wednesday night, near Nanjing Road and Shandong Road, two Japanese civilians, Kimura and Suzuki, were shot at. The shooter, named Wang Changfa (transliteration), 21 years old, also sustained a gunshot wound to his left buttock, causing significant bleeding. He sought emergency treatment at Renji Hospital. The Central Police received the report and dispatched detectives to the hospital to arrest him.

Wang confessed immediately to shooting and injuring the two Japanese nationals, stating that three others collaborated with him in the assassination attempt. After firing six or seven shots at the Japanese men, he fled. In his haste, he accidentally triggered the gun, firing a bullet that struck his buttock. He discarded the .32 caliber automatic pistol, boarded a rickshaw, and pretended to be a pedestrian injured by a stray bullet. However, due to the continuous bleeding, he went to Renji Hospital for treatment.

After completing the interrogation, the police handed Wang over to the Japanese authorities for transfer to the Japanese military hospital. Simultaneously, the police are currently investigating the remaining three accomplices, who are rumored to have gone into hiding in the Western District. Among the injured Japanese men, Kimura's condition is quite critical, while Suzuki's injury appears to be healing. It is also reported that the shooting at a car that occurred at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road around 9 PM on Wednesday was also committed by these four individuals. The only occupant of the car injured was a customs official named Fukuyama, who sustained minor injuries and did not seek hospital treatment. It is also reported that Wang stated to the police during his confession yesterday that he was forced to do this due to unemployment. However, it is unknown whether Wang has revealed who ordered him to do so.

### Stomach Ailment Classic

Knowing the Quality of Stomach Medicine To know whether a stomach medicine is good or bad, if after taking it for half a month, there is no improvement and the dosage needs to be increased, it can be determined that it is extremely difficult to cure stomach diseases, and conversely, if after taking it for half a month, the illness is completely cured or alleviated and the dosage can be reduced, it can be trusted to be able to cure stomach diseases. There are many stomach medicines on the market, but only "Ji Qu Bing" can gradually reduce the dosage until the disease is completely eliminated and health is restored.

Treating Stomach Ailments Requires Treating Stomach Ulcers The root cause of chronic stomach ailments lies in stomach ulcers. Stomach medicines containing anesthetics, baking soda, or alkaline substances such as calcium, magnesium, and bismuth can never cure stomach ulcers, so it is impossible to completely cure chronic stomach ailments. "Ji Qu Bing" is a newly developed aluminum compound that can effectively and quickly heal stomach ulcers, thus being able to completely cure chronic stomach ailments. Stopping stomach pain is just a part of it.

"Ji Qu Bing Overwhelms Imported Famous Medicines" It has been repeatedly heard that old stomach ailment sufferers have taken foreign stomach medicines for several years without any improvement in their condition, or even with worsening conditions. However, after taking "Ji Qu Bing" for a month, the illness was completely eliminated and health was restored. Furthermore, according to reports from many doctors, the effectiveness of "Ji Qu Bing" in completely curing stomach ailments has indeed surpassed all famous and expensive stomach medicines imported from the East and West. There is no need to discuss other inferior medicines. This is truly good news for stomach ailment sufferers and an honor for the domestic industry. Produced by Tianping Pharmaceutical Factory. Available in pharmacies and companies. Trial packs are sold in cigarette paper shops.

### The Importance of Nutrition

— Guo Hongdi

The issue of nutrition has always been overlooked in China, where even having enough to eat is not always assured. However, in recent years, the diligent research of foreign nutrition experts has made the issue of nutrition a pressing and serious one that can no longer be disregarded.

We have always known that nutrition is related to physiological development and health, and we thought that the importance of nutrition was "just like that." However, according to scientists, nutrition is not only related to physiology but also to psychological health. Some children who are usually listless and considered lazy by nature are, according to nutrition experts, simply lacking certain nutrients. There is also another type of child who is hyperactive, mischievous, likes to play pranks, and refuses to follow rules, the so-called "bad kid," who, according to research, is also due to a lack of certain nutrients in their diet.

It is said that during the physical examinations for new students at a certain medical college in Shanghai this year, one-third of the several hundred new students who passed the exams and were preparing to be admitted were found to have tuberculosis. The rampant spread of tuberculosis bacteria and lack of nutrition are two of the main reasons. Therefore, the research and solution of nutritional problems are urgent tasks for every family and every individual.

The student economic canteen organized by the student relief department of the YMCA is a new attempt to address nutrition and economic issues. We believe that such facilities are worthy of enthusiastic support and emulation by the community.

Military Equipment

### Battlefield X-Ray Vehicle

— Ke Zhong

If there is no good medical equipment, many wounded soldiers on the battlefield have no choice but to sit and wait for death. In view of this, military authorities in various countries are making every effort to improve various medical facilities. The United States military has specially built a large vehicle 22 feet long to rescue wounded soldiers, equipped with full X-ray equipment and a small generator, which can use the car's engine to generate its own electricity. The inside of the X-ray room is lined with lead sheets. There is also a darkroom to immediately develop the X-ray photos. Once this vehicle goes to the front lines, it will certainly save the lives of many wounded soldiers.

### Nutritional Subsidies

— Fang Shaozeng

Recently, I read an article in a British economics magazine about the measures proposed by the British government to address the nutritional problems of their children, and I couldn't help but pay attention. This issue is truly worthy of the attention of people with insight and should be urgently advocated to arouse everyone's awareness.

The general youth of our China almost all appear to be undernourished. There are many reasons for this, but insufficient economic resources have a great impact.

Many impoverished people harbor great ambitions, but due to insufficient nutrition and weak constitutions, no matter how broad their knowledge or how noble their character, they often fail to cope with the complex affairs of society or succumb to disease, either "dying before they achieve their goals" or retiring to recuperate, unable to work for the rest of their lives. This situation is common among our young students today, and there are likely many cases in other areas as well. Because the unhealthy students of today are the unhealthy administrators of society tomorrow. No wonder the work efficiency of the Chinese is only one-fifth that of the Americans - this is based on statistical evidence. If things continue this way, how can we make our country prosperous and strong?

Some people think that to be healthy, all one needs to do is exercise more, but it is not that simple. While exercise is certainly necessary for people to be healthy, the result of exercise is accelerated metabolism. If there is no sufficient nutritional material to supplement it at this time, then exercise is in vain. As for young people in the developmental stage, they need even more nutrition. These are all issues of health and hygiene, but they cannot be separated from economic issues. Regarding this aspect, I think we can always find a way, we should always find a way. Now I would like to introduce the British method to everyone for reference:

What they propose is a subsidy system. Families with low incomes who have more than two children will receive a certain amount of nutritional subsidy each month for each child under the age of sixteen exceeding this number. This subsidy is paid by salary earners exceeding a certain amount, who contribute a percentage of their monthly salary. It is then distributed directly to the children's mothers by the post office, public institutions, or food stores as nutrition fees for the children. This subsidy is different from other subsidies in that it can achieve the purpose of benefiting the children.

This is the method adopted by the British government to address the nutritional problems of children during the war. Today, in China, we need to study this issue even more. It is hoped that those who care about social welfare will take immediate action to find a solution.

### De-"Toxification"

— Yan Zheng

Good literary works should accurately reflect reality. (Those that can foresee the future based on a deep awareness of current trends are, of course, even better.) Whether a literary work is toxic or not should also be judged by whether it accurately and profoundly reflects reality.

Some people, in order to protect their exclusive interests, deliberately distort and embellish reality, promoting the rationality and permanence of the existing social system. Others are paid to assist, diligently praising the petty bourgeoisie's cozy and inactive ideals, engaging in conscious deception. What is toxic to the masses is beneficial to them.

The production and existence of toxic reading materials have their social basis and historical conditions.

To rescue the masses from ignorance and obscurity, we should first not neglect the great cognitive and educational value of reading materials, and strive to promote the publication of good books. At the same time, relentlessly criticizing those that are toxic is also of great significance.

### Misattribution

— Chen Qizuo

Son: Dad! Books are really expensive now. Such a thin book costs more than four yuan. Father: Hey! Bastard! It's clearly written as three corners. Are you trying to trick me?

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Twelfth Unexpected Storm

Because of Yu Kun's leisurely and dissolute lifestyle, Autumn Begonia felt even more acutely the bitterness in her heart. Several years ago, under a great deal of self-control, she deliberately prevented Luo Xiangqi from finding her way back and reuniting with them, which was already an indelible trauma for her. Now, with the loss of her beloved daughter, she naturally felt even more hopeless!

The louder Yu Kun's laughter, the more deeply Autumn Begonia felt the freedom of being without love and without a home. However, now it was too late to abandon the people she loved again!

"...I'll take care of your daughter's matter..." Yu Kun's words kept ringing in her ears, and she finally couldn't help but shout from the pit, "Hey, Second Brother, can you drink less wine? We still have serious things to discuss!"

It was unclear whether Yu Kun was too drunk to hear her, or whether he had heard her but didn't care. Autumn Begonia shouted in vain for a while, but Yu Kun continued to make noise, laughing and joking loudly, until he had finished the ten liang of Five Skin Wine in the bottle in one go. Autumn Begonia stared wide-eyed in the room, waiting anxiously. She finally waited for him to stagger into the room, wanting to ask him if he had any solutions for Mei Shi's matter, but unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the room, he lay down on Mei Bao's small couch, mumbled a few words, and then fell asleep, snoring loudly.

### Suggestions for Theater Seat Reservations

— Zhi Yu

A person named Deng Tuo sent a letter to a Western newspaper, making suggestions regarding theater seat reservation methods. The main idea was: "Most theaters in this city have already implemented telephone seat reservation methods, but this method only applies to those who pay the ticket price two hours before the show, otherwise the seats will not be reserved. (Note: Ordinary telephone seat reservations are reserved until ten minutes before the show, but even those who have not paid the ticket price can use this method.) If they have paid the ticket price, then it is always reserved, whether they come or not, so this method is very convenient and reasonable.

In view of the dense number of theaters in Shanghai now, it is entirely possible to implement a new method that I am now going to contribute for everyone's consideration. This is that each theater should set up branches in other theaters to make seat reservations. In other words, each theater can sell tickets for other theaters, and ticket purchases must be paid in cash, without reservations. This can save the theaters the work of delivering tickets and the audience the trouble of going far in advance to buy tickets. Because crossing the street, etc., are all inconvenient. This method has already been implemented in London and New York, and Shanghai is also a big city, qualified to implement this method, so you may as well follow suit.

Mr. Deng Wan's opinion is not against "telephone seat reservations," but what he is suggesting now is just another method worth considering. If this method can be implemented, then the tickets sold by the "seat ticket sales points" must not be assigned by number, because this would make it very difficult to manage the seats in the theater. For the audience, they can buy tickets for theaters a greater distance away from nearby locations, but for the theaters, it would cause another layer of trouble. Because they must return the unsold tickets from each distribution point a certain amount of time before the show, just like the situation where charity lottery tickets are drawn at 2 PM, and unsold tickets are collected from each distribution point at 12 noon. Every method has its advantages and disadvantages, the main thing is to be able to seek improvement. The same is true for the seat reservation method suggested by Mr. Deng Tuo, setting up "seat ticket distribution points," etc.

### Chen Juanjuan in Her Girlhood

— Yi

There is a real scarcity of child star talent in the Chinese film industry, and even fewer who have become famous. Among the female child stars, Chen Juanjuan is more talented, clever and cute, and lively. In the past, she was all in her precious childhood, which was also her golden age. Rising stars include Hu Rongrong, Yan Fenghuang, and Ye Xiaojuan, all of whom are her good companions. Juanjuan's age, according to general estimates, has indeed exceeded fourteen years. Her figure is gradually becoming taller, and she is busy making new clothes. Her voice has also changed slightly, but her face is still as beautiful as ever, her personality is gentle, polite, innocent, and innocent, which makes fans very envious. The picture above seems to be shedding tears and sobbing, which is a tragic scene on the screen. (Photo by Ma Yonghua)

### Little Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden

— Written by Kunling's Zheng Guo Yi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang

Preface

After "Little Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden" ended in forty episodes, the thirsty readers clamored to continue writing about a few more people to avoid any omissions. I am extremely grateful for their earnest intentions! However, we do not intend to make any further "supplements." Fortunately, we had already stated: "There are countless talented people in the opera world, and it is inevitable that some will be missed."

Before the publication of "Little Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden," a future promise was made in the "Little Preface," saying that "Female artists will be described in another series, not out of any discrimination." Now that the financial edition of "Little Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden" has been completed, the previous statement should of course be "honored." The entire series will consist of twenty people and will still be published every Wednesday and Saturday.

Sixteenth Carrying His Beloved From the Trap Early

Tian Hongyu stood foolishly on the doorstep, just staring blankly. The carriages and horses had long disappeared, but his body remained standing upright. Those around him couldn't help but call out to him, and he finally stamped his feet and sighed, walking inside. Wu Sangui happily carried the delicate bird back to his father's place. He took Chen Yuanyuan to see his father, and when his family, including Wu Xiang, saw Chen Yuanyuan, they couldn't help but be amazed. After Wu Sangui told him about Tian Hongyu's generous gift, they understood. He didn't say anything in front of Chen Yuanyuan, but said to Wu Sangui, "The imperial edict urges you to leave the customs as soon as possible, mobilize the troops, and don't delay the great event, or it will be too late." Wu Sangui said, "I will bid farewell to the Emperor tomorrow, and then leave the customs. Please rest assured, Father." It was past two o'clock in the morning, and Wu Sangui hurriedly ordered the servants to light a pair of flower candles in his room, and then went with Chen Yuanyuan to share a sweet dream. This room was originally prepared by Wu Xiang for his daughter-in-law, so that they could stay when his son and his wife came to Beijing, so it was gorgeous and clean, just like new. This time, Wu Sangui suddenly came to Beijing without bringing his wife, and he felt a little impatient sleeping alone on a cold bed. Tonight, he suddenly gained a Chen Yuanyuan who was the embodiment of an angel, and they shared the joy of the gods, only regretting that the spring night was too short. The next day, Wu Sangui went to court to pay homage to Emperor Chongzhen. The Emperor ordered him to leave the customs immediately without delay. Wu Sangui bowed and accepted the order, and returned home to immediately pack up and set off, wanting to take Chen Yuanyuan with him. Chen Yuanyuan also gladly wanted to go with Wu Sangui. The night was full of romance and endless tenderness. At this moment, the two of them were naturally reluctant to part. But Wu Xiang called Wu Sangui to the inner room to talk. He first asked Wu Sangui if he wanted to take Chen Yuanyuan with him on this trip. Wu Sangui naturally wanted to take her with him. Wu Xiang's face immediately darkened, and he shook his hand at Wu Sangui, saying, "I have a few words of warning for you, that you must not take Chen Yuanyuan. It's not that I want to interfere with you, you should think about it yourself." Wu Sangui couldn't help but be stunned when he heard his father's words. (End of Chapter Sixteen) (175)
