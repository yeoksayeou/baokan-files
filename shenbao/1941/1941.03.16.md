### Roosevelt's Broadcast Speech This Morning: US Decides to Increase Aid to China; Public Opinion in Various States Changes, Becoming Increasingly Tough; Chongqing Newspaper Urges Close Cooperation Among China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union

Washington - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the US aid program to China is proceeding smoothly. He indicated that the government is currently considering increasing aid. A reporter asked President Roosevelt what kind of enemy the armaments sent to China were intended to resist. The President replied that this question had not been considered. The reporter's question was obviously prompted by rumors of friction between General Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Communists. President Roosevelt also stated that he hoped to leave Washington between March 17th and 29th for a short vacation, and believed he would go to Florida or the Gulf of Mexico for fishing.

Washington - According to a poll released today, since February of this year, attitudes toward Japan and Germany have become increasingly tough in all sectors of the United States. The number of people who opposed war with Japan if necessary to stop its southward expansion has decreased. Such a sudden change in the American people's attitude towards Japan within a month is considered extremely important by observers, who believe that Matsuoka's trip to Berlin may be a prelude to Japan's implementation of new policies in the Far East. According to the poll, the American people oppose Japan's southward advance for two main reasons: first, the United States has too much at stake in the Pacific to easily allow Japan to gain a stronger foothold; second, Japan is an old hand at plunder and aggression, just like Hitler. According to the survey results, the anti-Japanese attitude in the western states is extremely tough, with 53% advocating taking the risk of war with Japan. (14th dispatch)

Chongqing - Newspapers are commenting on Matsuoka's trip to Europe. The Yishi Bao concludes by advocating three points: (1) China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia should establish a military alliance in the Pacific; (2) China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should cooperate closely to sanction the Axis powers; (3) Britain and the United States should at least establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union similar to those between Germany and the Soviet Union. It also states that for the sake of the future of democratic nations, it is not enough to merely lift the moral embargo against the Soviet Union, the meetings between Cripps and Vyshinsky are not enough, and the joint defense of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia is not enough. Using all means to prevent Japan and the Soviet Union from approaching is still not enough. The most important and convenient way is only the above three methods. The Saodang Bao reports that Matsuoka's trip to Europe is to promote a German-Soviet peace, hoping to thereby escape Japan's obligations to the Axis alliance, while also hoping to use black market trading to end the Sino-Japanese War. Although his intentions are painstaking, his awkward situation will not elicit sympathy from Europeans. The Shishi Xinbao observes that Japan is using its southward expansion strategy as capital to bargain with its allies, but the result of trying to strengthen the Axis is likely to destroy the Axis.

Some US War Supplies Bound for Britain Will Also Be Transferred

Washington - The US program to fully aid democratic nations is proceeding at an accelerated pace. The first batch of goods to aid Britain under the Lend-Lease Act has already been shipped. The United States is now taking various steps internally to increase the rate of production of national defense goods. Officials are proceeding to establish a supreme mediation body to investigate labor disputes, so as not to hinder the production of armaments. (United Press, 15th)

Washington - Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson announced yesterday that the shipment of US war materials to Britain has already begun. The "Lend-Lease Act" authorizes the rapid transfer of $1.3 billion worth of war materials and supplies to democratic nations resisting aggression. At the same time, President Roosevelt told White House reporters that the news that the United States had transferred ships to Britain was not true. However, he said that some ships might be transferred to Britain in the future. The President said that any country resisting aggression could receive US aid under the "Lend-Lease Act." He pointed out that Turkey and Yugoslavia are also eligible to receive US aid, but he had not received a report on aid to Turkey. The President continued that aid to Ireland was not being considered. He said that Spain urgently needs food, but the United States must be sure that the food shipped to Spain will not be transferred elsewhere. The President called for practical measures to be taken for the entire food relief program. (United Press, 15th)

London - British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced that the Minister of Shipping, Sir Arthur Salter, will soon depart for the United States to discuss the issue of US ship aid to Britain. Also, the Minister of Food, Lord Woolton, has dispatched a delegation led by Brandt to the United States to discuss the issue of food supplies. (United Press, 15th)

Washington - President Roosevelt said yesterday that no decision had been made regarding the continued transfer of warships to Britain. The rumor that 100 warships had already been transferred is not true. (Reuters, 15th)

### Governor of Hong Kong Returns to Post, Discusses the Overall Situation in the Far East

Hong Kong - The Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffry Northcote, has returned from England after his sick leave. According to his interview with a reporter, Britain's belief in final victory is growing stronger every day. Looking back at last year, we suffered major blows in France and Belgium, but now we have fully recovered. Seeing our repeated victories in Africa, we are now able to attack the enemy. Furthermore, we are gradually able to overcome the threat of night-raid bombers, piracy ships, and submarines. We are confident that we will eventually achieve complete victory. When asked about the overall situation in the Far East, the Governor replied that he believed it had greatly stabilized in the past few weeks. Although Hong Kong is prepared to deal with any contingency, it still hopes to continue friendly relations with its neighbors in the Pacific. (Reuters, 15th)

### Britain Will Accelerate Assistance to China, Building the Yunnan-Burma Railway

Chongqing - It is reported that Britain, in order to aid China, will build a railway from Lashio in Burma to the Chinese border, and will accelerate assistance to China in building the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Burma Road (from Kunming to Lashio). All parties here today expressed warm welcome to the above news. Well-informed sources pointed out that China has already started construction from the Kunming terminus, and currently uses about 10 to 15 miles of railway west of Kunming. In the northeast of Kunming, there is also 100 miles of railway heading towards Guiyang. The railway from Lashio to the border may shorten the transportation route, but it is said here that the greatest benefit of the road is to save fuel, because a large part of the cargo on the current highway is used to transport gasoline. Extending the railway to the border line will reduce the amount of gasoline carried and shorten the cargo transport route. It is learned that the Chinese section of the road will burn coal produced in China, which will greatly help the overall transport capacity of the road. (United Press, 15th)

### Japan and the Dutch East Indies Continue Negotiations

Tokyo - According to Japanese sources in Batavia, Japanese representative Yoshizawa met with Van Couk, Director of the Economic Affairs Bureau of the Dutch East Indies. Because this meeting was held at the same time as the talks between the Japanese Consul General and Hogestralden, it has attracted considerable attention. It is heard that what the Japanese Consul General and Hogestralden discussed were the details of the proposed economic agreement between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 15th)

### Japan Will Strictly Adopt a Centralized System

Tokyo - Reliable sources say that in the near future, Japan will face a more stringent centralized rule. The "Imperial Rule Assistance Association," which was formed after the government dissolved all political parties last year, will begin to take important steps in early April to bring the country under a one-party dictatorship. This movement will, in principle, imitate the Axis countries, and will be led by Prime Minister Konoe. In this regard, the Asahi Shimbun stated that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will merge various organizations for "developing Asia" on April 3 to form the Greater East Asia League, with Konoe as chairman. The purpose of the merger is to initiate a national movement and cooperate with officials from the Army, Navy, and the China Affairs Bureau to establish a government that supports the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. (United Press, 15th)

### Konoe Reports on Diplomacy in the Diet

German Ambassador to Japan, Wörmann, is coming here from Manchuria to accompany Matsuoka to Berlin. As for whether Matsuoka will have the possibility of discussing matters with Stalin or other Soviet government officials, officials remain silent. At the same time, it is heard that Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Lieutenant General Tatekawa, hosted a grand banquet at his official residence. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and other senior Soviet government officials attended the banquet. It is rumored that Matsuoka will also go to London and Paris, but Tokyo officials have denied this. (International News Service, 15th)

London - French sources here reported yesterday that since January of this year, a mixed Soviet-Japanese committee of five people has been studying ways to stabilize Soviet-Japanese relations. It is heard that the first step towards a non-aggression pact is to revise the Treaty of Portsmouth. That treaty was signed by Japan and the Soviet Union in the United States after the Russo-Japanese War, and is now considered outdated. It is claimed that Japan is very willing to take this step. It is rumored that it is easy to get the Soviet Union to change its attitude towards Chongqing and to redraw the border of Manchuria. It is rumored that Japan needs a ten-year pact and will turn Inner Mongolia, Rehe, and Chahar into buffer zones. (International News Service, 15th)

Vatican City - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will arrive in Rome on the 3rd or 4th of next month. It is heard that in addition to meeting with Italian authorities, he will also take the opportunity to pay his respects to Pope Pius XII. (Havas, 15th)

Editorial

### The Profit and Loss Account of the Axis Powers

What is claimed to be a spring offensive, is often referred to by the Axis powers as the March offensive. Today is already March 16th; whether it is a spring offensive or a "March offensive", it has not yet been realized; this has wasted at least half a month of precious time. Matsuoka Yosuke's trip to Europe, if not a diplomatic smokescreen used to divert attention and conceal military operations, is at least sufficient to prove that the Axis powers' preparatory work before launching an offensive is not yet fully in place; therefore, whether the so-called "March offensive" is going to fail again will be revealed in the next two weeks.

If we calculate the profit and loss account for the Axis powers since the defeat of France in June last year, the positive aspects worth mentioning include the formation of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, Germany's bloodless occupation of Romanian and Bulgarian territory, and Japan's acquisition of some not-yet-fully-defined advantages in Vietnam. However, the negative aspects that can be written about in detail are numerous: Italy's defeat in the Balkan Peninsula and on the African continent has swept away the prestige of the Blackshirt comrades. Not only does Hitler not receive the slightest help from Mussolini, but he is instead greatly dragged down by him; this is one. Although the defeated Vichy government and the Spanish dictator Franco have been threatened and enticed by Germany in an attempt to force them to join the Axis and jointly fight against Britain, the attitude of France and Spain has remained consistently ambivalent up to now. Not only have they not jumped straight into the fire, but Britain and the United States still have room for competition in diplomacy towards them, which makes Hitler dare not coerce them too much; this is two. Although Japan has spared no effort to successfully orchestrate the scene of Thailand and Vietnam being unified, it has not actually occupied any major rights and interests sufficient to influence the situation in the South Pacific. However, it has startled the snake, prompting the democratic countries to implement joint defense in the Far East, which makes Japan's southward advance have to be more cautious, hesitating again and again; this is three. The reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Japan is still vague, and German-Soviet relations have undergone subtle changes due to the Balkan issue; the Soviet Union's "friendly neutrality", although imperative to contend for, is still the factor that the Axis powers are most deeply wary of. In the future, a little carelessness could lead to a complete change of the global situation; this is four. Apart from this, the active attitude and actions of the United States are the most unfavorable point for the Axis powers. In the past, the United States was still limited to spiritually supporting the democratic countries, but since the defeat of France, through President Roosevelt's re-election and up to the recent passing of the "Lend-Lease Act", US diplomacy has clearly evolved from spiritual support to material assistance. After signing the Lend-Lease Act, President Roosevelt immediately asked Congress to allocate $7 billion and declared that "any country resisting aggression can receive US aid under the Lend-Lease Act, and even Turkey and Yugoslavia are eligible to receive US aid" (United Press report yesterday). This is of course a fatal blow to the Axis powers, and it is the biggest loss suffered in the past nine months; this is five.

The above is what is said to be the salient points. Please further elaborate on the gains and losses of the Axis powers based on the recent facts that have occurred.

First, after occupying Bulgaria, Hitler failed to immediately break the relationship between the British and Turkish alliance, nor did he subdue Greece and force it to give up its resistance. Even the issue of Yugoslavia's entry into the alliance, which initially seemed as easy as picking something out of a pocket, is now seeing twists and turns, unable to be realized smoothly. Although it is said that the southern country has shown signs of surrender to some extent, and sooner or later it will inevitably follow in the footsteps of Romania and Bulgaria, the delay of more than ten days has at least prevented Hitler from launching an offensive against Greece or other areas before the US Congress passes the Lend-Lease Act. This setback, this loss, for the Axis powers is truly difficult to estimate.

Second, regarding Matsuoka's mission to Europe, recent commentators have made many analyses. Regardless of whether his purpose is to strengthen the Axis collusion or to promote Soviet-Japanese rapprochement, the fact that there are still things that need to be "strengthened" or must be "promoted" shows that the joint offensive by Germany, Italy, and Japan that the world was previously worried about has not yet matured at this time. What can be known is that Germany is eager for Japan to advance southward to contain Britain and the United States, but before advancing southward, Japan still has demands on Hitler; the main conditions are nothing more than two: one is to receive military assistance from Germany, and the other is to have Germany guarantee the Soviet Union's friendly neutrality. If these two points cannot be achieved, Hitler may not be willing to "risk his life" for him even if he forces it a little harder. According to news from Vichy, Matsuoka's trip will request 1,500 aircraft from Germany, which is very possible; however, before Matsuoka's trip has achieved any concrete results, the British and American sides have already become more vigilant as a result. It is heard that Britain is considering expanding aid to China, the United States has approved a large amount of funding for the fortification of the Pacific, and President Roosevelt yesterday announced to the press: "The US aid program to China is proceeding smoothly, and the government is currently considering increasing aid". These are also direct answers to Matsuoka's visit to Germany and Italy.

In summary, it can be seen that the actions of the Axis powers are not only insufficient to scare off the democratic countries, but instead encourage the democratic countries, causing them to make bigger and firmer decisions and forcing them to seek effective countermeasures. If the three-nation alliance cannot come up with any new tricks and continues its unfavorable state of "more losses than gains" over the past nine months, then it will be seen that the democratic front, with the strong support of the United States, will change from defense to offense, and will soon transform and enter a dominant position.

### China News Association to Hold Inaugural Meeting in Chongqing Today, President Chiang Sends Special Telegram of Encouragement

Chongqing: The China News Association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the 16th. President Chiang sent a special telegram of encouragement, the original text of which is as follows: To all members of the China News Association, Upon the establishment of your association, marking the beginning of a nationwide organization for the news industry in our country, I am deeply gratified. The work of a journalist cannot be compared to ordinary professions because their tasks are equivalent to education, and their influence affects the rise and fall of the nation's destiny. Therefore, the career of a journalist should not be regarded merely as a means of livelihood but must have a higher purpose. If the news industry is compared to education, then the entire country is their classroom, and all readers are influenced by them. Moreover, travelers from all directions rely on it to observe national opinions, and scholars of later generations rely on it to examine the history of the country. In terms of space, it connects both internal and external affairs; in terms of time, it connects the past and present. Therefore, journalists must hold themselves to a high standard and diligently cultivate themselves, not abandoning their profession due to difficulties, nor ceasing their efforts due to obstacles. What journalists rely on to maintain their lasting efforts are the aspirations to save the country and the world, and the trend of daily renewal. However, a solo string cannot create a beautiful melody, so it requires collective wisdom and effort to broaden their aspirations. Studying alone without friends leads to limited knowledge, so mutual encouragement and learning are necessary to ensure the continuous progress of their endeavors. Some say that China's news industry has made great progress during the war of resistance and national reconstruction, but compared to modern countries, it still lags far behind. I, Zhongzheng, believe that our backwardness lies only in the material conditions of technology and equipment. As for the ambition to serve the country in times of difficulty and the spirit of courageously rushing to righteousness, we have never been behind others. Since the war of resistance and national reconstruction, our news industry has become increasingly aware of the common national policies and has become increasingly firm in supporting the common national cause. At this time of concentrated will and power, I hope that the news industry will unite, and all colleagues across the country will strive for a good opportunity to advance the news industry. Your association is a union of news researchers and practitioners. I hope you will uphold the highest guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People, continuously study journalism, improve the news industry, and strive to achieve these goals. Zhongzheng dares to believe that the great cause of China's national revolution will be vigorously promoted by the enthusiastic advocacy of the news industry, and that its complete success will be achieved through the continued struggle of our news industry. Promoting the ethics of the news industry and maintaining the honor of the news industry are the aspirations of you all, and also the good fortune of the nation. There are myriad tasks in the national reconstruction. We must work diligently and with one heart to fulfill our great responsibilities. I have high hopes for your association. Chiang Kai-shek, deleted. (15th Telegram)

Chongqing: The China News Association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the morning of the 16th. President Chiang recently sent a special telegram to the association to congratulate and encourage them, saying, in brief, that some believe that although China's news industry has made great progress during the war of resistance and national reconstruction, it still lags far behind modern countries. He, however, believes that China's backwardness lies only in the material conditions of technology and equipment. As for the ambition to serve the country in times of difficulty and the spirit of courageously rushing to righteousness, we have never been behind others. He also said that he believes that the great cause of China's national revolution will be vigorously promoted by the enthusiastic advocacy of the news industry, and that its complete success will be achieved through the continued struggle of the news industry.

### U.S. House Passes Massive Naval Budget to Strengthen Pacific Defenses and Build Six Battlecruisers

Washington: Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a naval budget of $3,415,620,000 without objection and sent it to the Senate. It is believed that this amount is sufficient to deter aggression by the Axis powers in Europe and Asia. Of this amount, $1,515,000,000 is a continuation of the funds to complete the two-ocean navy, and $434,000,000 is for the construction of air force equipment. Most of the funds will be used to strengthen Pacific defenses. Nevada Democratic Congressman Scrugham advocated that this bill should be passed immediately, regardless of aid to Britain, and stated that unless the United States has a large national defense, the voracious Axis powers of Europe and Asia will attack the United States. If Britain is defeated, there is an immediate danger of invasion. Enemies from the Caribbean islands and Mexico, equipped with modern bombing equipment, can inflict heavy damage on American cities and cause suffering to the people. As for the allocation of these funds, $31,939,000 is for coastal engineering construction in Hawaii, of which $22,438,111 is used in Hawaii alone, including the construction of bulletproof air-raid shelters, power plants, coastal stone walls and jetties, new hangars, aircraft runways, and armories. This amount does not include the cost of maintaining the fleet, aircraft, artillery, and naval equipment, but it does include defensive works from Pearl Harbor to the Philippines, Singapore, and southern Samoa. In addition, Guam, Samoa, Johnston Island, and Palmyra Island have all been allocated funds. The funds for Guam are $1 million for expanding the seaplane base, $187,000 for constructing military roads, and $250,000 for improving the power plant. At the same time, the Philippines has also been allocated $150,000 for defense equipment, $100,000 for constructing a power plant for the Dewey dry dock, and $65,000 for constructing a naval fuel depot and oil pipeline at Fort Sanlay. (United Press, 15th)

Washington: The House yesterday unanimously passed the $3,446,000,000 naval appropriations bill, which includes funds for the construction of new-type battlecruisers. However, the new-type warships were not mentioned during the House's one-hour and twenty-minute debate. The new-type warships were first mentioned in the forms submitted by the U.S. Navy to the House Naval Affairs Committee. Committee Chairman Vinson said that the United States' decision to build new-type warships was not influenced by Japan's naval shipbuilding program. The new-type warships are fast and equipped with heavy artillery, making them particularly suitable for pursuing maritime commerce raiders and conducting rapid naval bombardments. According to informed sources, Japan is also building this type of new-type warship, and two super-large cruisers have already begun service. The Navy declined to release any details of the new warships. The new warships were ordered in September last year when Congress passed the two-ocean navy bill and mentioned 27,000-ton cruisers. The firepower of this type of cruiser is almost equal to that of the largest battleships, but the speed is far greater than that of battleships because the armor plate is smaller. Experts here believe that the new-type cruisers will be equipped with 14-inch guns and reach a speed of 32 knots, with each ship costing $43 million. (United Press, 15th)

Washington: According to yesterday's news, the U.S. Navy is building six battlecruisers. The Washington Post specifically commented on this matter, believing that this move is equivalent to a response to Japan because it has recently been reported that Japan is also building this type of warship. The battlecruisers being built in the United States are the latest style and are completely different from the past styles. They are extremely powerful and have very high speeds. This is part of the $7 billion two-ocean navy plan. The cost of building battlecruisers has not been announced by the Navy authorities, but it is estimated that each ship will cost as much as $70 million, which is equivalent to the cost of each 35,000-ton displacement battleship.

### Thailand to Reach Understanding with Britain and the United States and Will Not Recognize Japanese Hegemony in East Asia

Washington: According to the New York Herald Tribune, after the signing of the Thai-Vietnamese agreement and the exchange of notes between Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam, Warawan, the chief Thai representative, issued a statement stating that the Thai government cannot recognize Japan's Greater East Asia Doctrine. Thailand will conduct relations with other countries on the basis of its own established national policy and the principle of reciprocity. This statement is roughly the same as the previous statement by the Dutch East Indies not recognizing Japan's Greater East Asia Doctrine, which is equivalent to refusing to recognize Japan's superior position in East Asia and its so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." It is heard that Warawan also stated that Thailand is prepared to reach an understanding with Britain and the United States, allowing it not to enter into any treaty with Japan that is harmful to democratic countries.

### Italian Troops Massively Reinforced, Another Full-Line Counterattack Fails, Greek Troops Charge and Fight with Unstoppable Force, Five Divisions of Blackshirt Warriors Lose Half Their Numbers

Athens: Athens Radio Station stated that yesterday Italian troops in Albania launched a counterattack along a 17-mile front, during which a large unit was completely annihilated. Reinforcements from Italy were deployed to the battle, repeatedly launching counterattacks with intense force, supported by artillery and aircraft which carried out intensive bombing. The first counterattack was reportedly fierce, but it was met with a severe blow by the Greek troops and ended in total failure. More reserves were then deployed to launch another attack, which was also repelled. At multiple locations, the Greek troops, after the Italian troops collapsed, immediately seized the opportunity to charge and capture the positions to which the Italian troops had retreated. A Greek Information Department statement stated that, according to Italian prisoners, five Italian divisions have lost half their numbers in the last five days. Many high-ranking Italian commanders have been captured. This is due to Mussolini forcing them to lead the operations by being at the forefront. (Reuters, 15th)

According to reports received, the fighting between Tajirini and Krisula, north of Pograt, was reportedly intense.

### Germany Exerts Effort to Win Over Southern Country, Negotiations Still in Stalemate, Southern Country's Attitude Remains Firm, Foreign Minister's Trip to Berlin Postponed

Zurich: According to news from diplomatic circles in the Southern Capital City received here, the situation between Germany and the Southern Country is becoming increasingly chaotic. The Southern Country's Foreign Minister and Korvezh have postponed their trip to Berlin until next week. According to informed sources, Germany insists that Southern Prime Minister Schwikovich must also attend, but Schwikovich is not eager to go to Germany again. This is the reason for the postponement of the meeting. Diplomats have confirmed the firm attitude of Yugoslavia in its talks with Germany. According to Yugoslav sources here, the Southern Army Headquarters continues to control the situation, rejecting any proposals from Germany involving the Southern Army, and opposing the conclusion of any agreement that would allow German troops to enter the country or obtain any military bases of any nature. (Reuters, 15th)

Southern Capital City: The Southern Country has not yet made any decision on the German proposals, which will inevitably postpone Hitler's timetable for action in the Balkan Peninsula. According to the Nazi plan, the Southern German agreement should be signed on Tuesday, and then Greece should be attacked immediately. However, politicians in the Southern Country have doubts about some of the clauses in the agreement proposed by Germany, believing that these clauses are actually equivalent to the Southern Country joining the Axis Pact. It is generally believed that the temporary Southern German stalemate is due to the Southern Country's cautious handling of matters and the German diplomats' extremely subtle handling of the situation. The Nazis obviously want to obtain the greatest concessions at the lowest risk. It is rumored that Germany is currently sending additional aircraft squadrons to Bulgaria and is gathering fast boats and submarines in the Aegean Sea for use, which shows the importance Germany attaches to the war in Greece. (Reuters, 15th)

Basel: The "Basler Zeitung" correspondent in Berlin telegraphed that the German Foreign Ministry is maintaining absolute silence on all political issues, including those concerning Yugoslavia. It is believed that negotiations between Germany and the Southern Country are currently in progress. (Reuters, 15th)

Nairobi: An official communique stated that the British military operations in Abyssinia continue, and the work of clearing enemy troops in Italian Somaliland is gradually being completed.

The situation in the captured areas is gradually returning to normal. (Reuters, 16th)

Cairo: British Air Force fighters and bombers continue to heavily damage Italian troops in Albania and Africa, while suffering very few losses themselves. This is evident from the recent communique from the British Air Force in the Middle East. The Tripoli naval base and main docks in Libya were heavily bombed by British aircraft on Wednesday night.

Moscow: The Soviet authorities awarded huge sums of money to scientists.

The establishment of this prize shows the Soviet state's respect for scientific engineering and cultural talents. Those who receive this prize are the pride of the Soviet Union. Their achievements have made a great contribution to the Soviet Union and the world. The development of Soviet science is due to the solid economic foundation of socialism and the entire policy of the Bolshevik Party government. The Soviet Union has spent huge subsidies in the field of science. The inventions of scientists Kapitsa and artillery expert Glivi have contributed greatly to national defense. In addition, Lychenko's summer sweet potato planting method has also attracted the attention of the Soviet people. In medicine, the President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences invented a new method to prolong human life, and scientist Fileratov also discovered a medical technique to restore sight to the blind. All of this greatly helps the health of the Soviet people. Among those who won the Stalin Prize, there are many scientists from before the revolution and young scientists created by the Soviet Union. All inventions by scientists from before the revolution have been developed by current young scientists. The Soviet Union now has extremely progressive leadership. Soviet scientists have turned theory into reality. Scientists from various republics have also won the Stalin Prize. In short, this decision by the Soviet authorities to award the Stalin Prize to scientists proves the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union in the field of science in the past six or seven years. Soviet scientists have applied theory to economics and national defense and have completed the tasks assigned to them by the government. In the current imperialist war, most of the culture has been destroyed, but the Soviet Union has shocked the world with its great production and cultural achievements." (Fifteenth, TASS dispatch)

The First Division League Championship Final between Tung Wah and the Western Police yesterday caused unprecedented chaos in Shanghai football history. The Recreation Ground dog racing track was set on fire and vandalized by spectators. Dog racing cannot be held for the next two days, resulting in losses of tens of thousands of dollars, setting an unprecedented record in Shanghai football matches. During the first half of the match, the Western Police took the lead with a score of 1-0. After Tung Wah scored a goal in the second half, they were scored on twice consecutively by the Western Police. At 25 minutes into the second half, the referee, Kanar, ordered Tai Linjing to leave the field. The entire Tung Wah team disagreed with the decision and abandoned the game together. 20,000 spectators, angry at the unfair refereeing, set fire to and vandalized the Recreation Ground. Police officers from the French Concession used force to disperse the crowd because the spectators did not disperse, resulting in many injuries and bloodshed. This was an extremely unfortunate incident for a football match.

Western Police Takes the Lead with 3-1

Yesterday's key to the First Division Championship was at the Recreation Ground, packed with over 20,000 spectators, squeezing like sardines. Both teams arrived late, and the match started at 2:40 PM. Referee Kanar ruled that Tai Linjing committed a foul when he drove a ball into the crowd at 30 minutes, and the goal was ruled invalid. Eight minutes later, Western Police's Qi Lihuaite single-handedly scored a goal. At the end of the first half, Tung Wah trailed 0-1. Switching sides to fight again, Adi equalized five minutes later. Subsequently, Willie Huaite and Nuo Gulov successively scored, leading 3-1. Tung Wah counterattacked. Huang Kehou dribbled the ball to the front of the opponent's goal and collided with the opponent. Kanar ruled that Huang committed a foul. Tai Linjing argued with reason. Kanar ruled that Tai should not question the referee and ordered Tai to leave the field. All Tung Wah players were unwilling to continue playing and withdrew from the field. Kanar declared that Tung Wah forfeited the game.

Order in Great Chaos Cannot Be Maintained

Spectators in the north and south stands roared, angered by the unfairness of the referee, inciting public anger, and removed wooden fences from the sides of the stands and threw them into the field.

For a time, order could not be maintained. At that time, there was a pile of straw next to the field, and the spectators set it on fire. Flower pots around were smashed to pieces. The glass windows of the office next to the north stand were almost completely destroyed. Order was in great chaos, and the emotions of the fans were still difficult to restrain. The French Concession police rushed to the scene immediately. Fire trucks were notified and also sent personnel to the scene, using water hoses to spray the spectators and extinguish the flames, avoiding a major disaster. Spectators dispersed in a rush around 5 PM.

### Food: Leveling Rice Prices is Not Difficult, Only Worry is Lack of Determination to Rectify, Looking at the Rice Market to Reiterate that There is No Reason for Rice Prices to Rise, Going to the Source to Observe that There is No Sign of Interruption

After the public reporting of foreign rice, the market immediately declined, showing that the rise in rice prices is entirely due to artificial hoarding and manipulation, not a natural trend. As long as those in charge have the determination to no longer be deaf and blind, and order large hoarders who hoard and refuse to sell to sell, breaking through sentiment, then the rice market will be cleared up in a matter of moments. Because Shanghai has 2.7 million shi of rice in storage, which is unprecedented since Shanghai had a rice market. Nor is it a place lacking rice. 20,000 shi arrive every day, while sales are actually less than 10,000. Nor is it a place where transportation is interrupted. It is a place where rice arrives every day and there is more than enough in storage. Therefore, leveling rice prices is not difficult, only the lack of determination to rectify is a concern. Therefore, this time, once reported, considerable results have been achieved. If further measures are taken, then rice prices will inevitably gradually return to normal. It should be known that among the 4 or 5 million citizens of Shanghai, how many are not worried about the pressure of life? Therefore, once rice prices rise, the whole city is panicked. Although yesterday's market price did not fall, it was slightly more stable than the previous day. The opening price of small grain rice was 3,400 yuan per 100 bags, then 3,200 yuan, but because large households did not sell and speculators took advantage of small purchases, the closing price returned to 1 or 2 yuan. However, it was still 2 or 3 yuan per bag less than the highest price of the previous market. Number 1 Saigon was only 3,000 yuan and 2,800 yuan per 100 bags, and Number 2 was 3,200 yuan and 3,000 yuan. In addition, rice tea original bags opened at 100 yuan and 98.5 yuan, and broken rice original bags opened at 88 yuan, all 2 yuan less. The total daily transaction was only 5,000 to 6,000 bags because hoarders refused to sell. However, once rice prices are slightly lower, there is a sign of resumption of hoarding, and if the root is not removed, there will be no peace. If only acting as a scare tactic, then those who are punished will be fortunate and unfortunate.

A large amount of imported rice arrives in Shanghai continuously, as reported in this newspaper. The German Deda ship of Hualun Foreign Firm directly loaded from Saigon, with 30,913 bags of foreign rice, 16,310 bags of broken rice, and 9,803 bags of corn. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docked at Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to unload. Yesterday, 440 bags of corn were loaded onto Taikoo Company's Shuntian wheel to Yantai. The Dingsheng wheel also had 535 bags of corn to Yantai today. It is heard that another French ship loaded with 3,048 tons of foreign rice will arrive from Saigon today morning. There is still a large batch on the way to Shanghai. (Zu)

Although thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice are unique, the public sentiment is still affected when the black market for foreign rice slightly stabilizes. Whether it is a shop or a household, no one is willing to rashly import more, so the route is turning sluggish. The owners are forced by the environment, and their willingness to sell is also loose. They are all depreciating prices to sell. Therefore, the closing price, except for thick japonica rice, which is more durable, only dropped by 1 yuan. Thin rice fell by about 2 yuan. The opening price of Chang japonica rice was 126 yuan per shi, Kunshan japonica rice was 124 yuan to 121 yuan, and Qingjiao thin rice was 120 yuan to 119 yuan.

Glutinous rice followed the other goods and was tired, dropping by 1 or 2 yuan. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 108 yuan, finally at 104 yuan.

### Although Vermicelli Prices Did Not Fall Significantly, Even With Large Shipments Arriving, Hoarders Still Control

The vermicelli market was slightly tired yesterday. The reason is that rice prices have returned to loose, and news of vermicelli arriving is endless. It is heard that 270,000 bags of Kem brand vermicelli are unloaded in Hong Kong and are being transported to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Hanyang wheel newly arrived with 47,000 bags of Australian vermicelli with the flower and bird brand etc. It has already unloaded at Taikoo No. 14 godown. Large shipments will definitely arrive next week, so public sentiment is turning lazy. There are quite a few sporadic households following the market to come out. However, large households have always controlled. Although the market did not fall significantly, yesterday the opening price of flower and bird clock tower brand Australian vermicelli was 32.6 yuan, Jinlong brand Kem vermicelli was 31.6 yuan. The flat-selling vermicelli of this factory is still 25 yuan, and there are still no changes to the 5,000 bags being wholesaled every day. There is generally no regular market for wheat.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Are Difficult to Suppress

Yesterday, the peanut oil market still held the original price. The trend of soybean oil spot goods was slightly soft. Futures, because the regulators intended to reduce the market first, then turned to the original fundamental Japanese merchants to negotiate and sell forward goods. Unexpectedly, external hoarders and hat-style speculators buy when prices are low, causing waves and fluctuations throughout the day. As a result, it was forcibly supported. Compared with the previous day's market, it only recovered 2 jiao. According to statistics, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were made, priced at 118 yuan, 100 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil, priced at 100 yuan, 200 barrels of Dalian oil, priced at 133 yuan (spot silver delivery), and more than 1,200 barrels for April delivery. The lowest price was 135.25 yuan, and the highest price was 137.25 yuan. Also, 728 bags of soybeans and 1,000 pieces of bean cake will be exported to Hong Kong today (16th).

### Finance Exporting Merchants Profiting From It: Tight Foreign Exchange Situation Not Seen to Expand

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed rates showed no change. The gray market for British and American exchange saw a resurgence of tightness, with "scalpers" following suit, making it increasingly crowded. In addition to Chinese speculators, there were also oil trading companies settling accounts. Although the supply from foreign banks was still abundant, the situation was such that supply was outnumbered by demand, leading to a potentially softening trend. As for the transaction process, the opening price in the morning was the lowest, with few transactions conducted at the opening price. As oil trading companies, speculators, and others began settling accounts and short positions were covered, the market gradually tightened, with no rebound until the close. The British pound also contracted, presumably due to foreign exchange intentions between Chase Bank and Chinese banks. Current rates were all quoted at three pence, 328125. The midday close resulted in the spot and forward rates aligning. The US dollar was at $5.40625, softer by 0.015625 compared to the previous day's spot British pound, and the US dollar was tighter by 0.000625.

Also, kerosene settlements

In the morning, with the London big bars, the near-term continued to rise 0.0625, the forward remained unchanged, the New York silver price was still flat, the London raw gold was fixed, the exchange rates for British against US dollars and Shanghai remained unchanged, the US against British dollars was unchanged, against Shanghai it contracted by two cents, and there was no market against France. The central bank's listed rates for various exchanges remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was three pence, 34375 for British gold, and $5.46875 for the US dollar, both flat. After the opening, very few transactions were conducted at the above prices, and speculators and foreign firms came to "scalp" one after another, and the market immediately showed softening. Initially, foreign banks sold a small number of March US dollars to speculators at $5.46875. At 9:30 AM, HSBC's listed rates were announced, all exchanges were flat, and the silver equalization tax was increased by 0.25%. Sterling transactions were also opened at that time. It was first heard that Chinese banks were doing spot trades at three pence, 328125, with a relatively ample potential. Later, American Bank Chase also entered Sterling at three pence, 328125 for April, so under the buying trend of the US dollar, the price softened. It is estimated that oil trading companies settled into this month's US dollar from $5.4375 to 40625. The speculators' appetite was for the US dollar, the same as the above price, and part of it was to cover short positions. However, because exporting merchants had sold from it, in addition to the supply from foreign banks, the position was still wide, and the tight situation did not spread. Until the midday close, spot and forward rates both tended to be consistent, with the British pound at three pence, 328125, and the US dollar at $5.40625, compared to the previous day's closing price, the British pound spot and forward contracted by 0.015625, the US dollar spot was uniquely tight by 0.0625, and the near and far terms softened by 0.03125. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Hong Kong British and American unchanged

Hong Kong, 15th (Saturday) telegram: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. British, American, and Japanese exchanges remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange spot rate dropped by 25 cents to $446.50. At 11:30 AM, it was reported flat, and the Shanghai exchange spot rate rebounded by three yuan to $449.50. The rest remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Tianjin exchange rates all contracted

Tianjin, 15th (Saturday) telegram: The foreign exchange market opened tight this morning. The London telegraphic transfer contracted by 0.0625 to three pence, 6875.

### Gold Market Surges for Five Consecutive Days: Continuing to Advance Towards Peak

Yesterday's gold market, the cooked raw gray market, the rising trend suddenly expanded, rapidly advancing towards the peak. The price has already flown out of the $6,400 mark. The inquiry is due to the contraction of the commercial exchange rate in Chongqing. Knowing it is absurd, the speculators' opportunity has not been abandoned. They are forcefully "scalping" foreign exchange, causing it to become tight again, so the gold price is also under the buying trend, flying from $6,325 to $6,435, finally seeing a rise of 102 yuan, creating a rising trend that has lasted for five consecutive days. About 10,000 taels were traded in half a day. People from all sides are quite firm. There is no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. The swap from March to April period, sellers Hengji, Hesheng, etc. posted 42-43 yuan to buyers, which was posted by buyers Chengji, etc., making about 2,000 taels. No cash transactions were heard. The price for term delivery was 370 yuan higher earlier, and then 340 yuan higher with buyers. Ornament gold, customs gold, etc. were all flat.

Cooked Raw Jumps More Than One Hundred Yuan

Since the opening in the morning (ten taels per bar) at 9:15 AM, it was high by 7 yuan, at $6,330. It retreated slightly to $6,325. When it was heard that the US dollar was soft, Hengji, Dafengxiang, and Yongyi Da all came to advance, and the price flew to 65 yuan in the fierce lifting of retail investors, reaching $6,390. Gold shop Chengji came to vigorously sell, and the securities group also vigorously sold, and it immediately saw a retreat to $6,370. The non-child giant short Tianyuan came to cover, and the price flew to 48 yuan again, raising to $6,418, which was sold by Heng Fei and a certain money house, and then retreated to $6,385. When it was heard that the April US dollar was difficult to settle at $5.4375, the rising trend re-ignited, Hengji, Yida, Litai, the securities group, and bill merchants gathered to absorb, and the price flew to 50 yuan again at noon, reaching $6,435. Hengji came back to sell, and the noon closing price was $6,425, a sharp rise of 102 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. According to the April US dollar settlement price of $5.40625, it was $6,441, only pressing 16 yuan. The off-market was depressed after the close, and Xinfeng Yong sold to $6,405, and finally $6,420. There was a fluctuation of 110 yuan in half a day. There is no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. The selling price of the cash gold shop's native gold was 350 yuan higher than the cooked raw term delivery, and the receiving price was 70-80 yuan lower than the selling price. There is no price or market for the current standard gold.

Ornament Gold Stands Still

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops, Datonghang and Xintonghang, both still hung at $690, and the receiving price was reduced by 40 yuan, it is said.

### Foreign Currencies Step Up

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The cooked raw market price soared, so British, American, and gold pounds each rose by one yuan. British gold bills tended to be fixed, and the market price stood flat. The demand for US gold bills was not scarce, and the market price stepped up. The evening market was as high as $18.25, up 1.5 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong bills stepped up to $4.50. Japanese military tickets continued to rise, and the evening market was as high as $1.93. Korean tickets had uniform supply and demand, and the market price stood flat, and the evening market still stood at $1.58 on the original plate.

### Coal: Tong Deli New Goods Arrive, Continued Increase of Fifteen Yuan

Tong Deli white coal, after being out of stock, has been silent for a long time. It is heard that thousands of tons have arrived at the port and have been unloaded onto the wharf. Except for unloading old wharf receipts, there is not much left. The company has temporarily suspended ordering for fellow merchants, with current vehicles limited, to prevent hoarding. No. 1, 2, and 3 blocks, the new price is $275 per ton, a continued increase of fifteen yuan. Because the merchants on this street have seen the tide rise, the prices have also increased, it is said.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Still Seen Favorably

Yesterday's gray market for public bonds surprisingly tended to hover. Although Xinfu has stopped selling, other firms still have sales, and buyers are not as lively as the previous day. Someone pulls when it is low, and someone throws when it is high. Rumors have not been confirmed after all, and most people's hearts are still upward. Only half a day of trading was done yesterday. The opening was stronger, and it gradually rose. Type C came out again for six yuan. Hefeng, Yitai, Shunchang, Hengfu, and Lianyi bought in, supplied by Dingkang, Zhenchang, and Tongkang. Jiufu, Xiexing Yuan, and Lianhe also came out in the middle, once seeing a low price of 5.50 yuan. Later, Hongda, Jiufeng, Shengda, Yichang, etc. still had purchases, and it slightly rebounded, and the market price was offset. No one has asked about Type D from beginning to end, so it could not be opened. As a result, the fluctuations were extremely small, but Type A felt slightly disadvantaged. The total number of transactions was about 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan in half a day. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: 100 shares of Huashang Electric Company were traded at a price of 7.70 yuan.

London, 14th (Friday) telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are still flat. Bank stocks continued to fall weakly. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation continued to fall by two shillings and six pence, with a price of eight pounds and fifteen shillings. HSBC shares each fell by one pound, British registered shares were seventy-five pounds, and Hong Kong registered shares were seventy-seven pounds. There is a market with no market, and the rest remains unchanged.

### British and French Industries Pay Dividends

The British and French Industries Limited Company, managed by the British Xiangmao Foreign Company, had a surplus of 300,000 national currency units last year. In addition to the interim dividend of two national currency units per share that has already been paid last year, it is planned to pay a final dividend of eight national currency units per share, for a total of ten national currency units for the whole year.

### The Business Consumption of Coal for Power Generation

The big problem of Shanghai's life, in addition to rice, is also coal. The Shanghai Electric Power Company once consumed about 50,000 tons of coal per month, and according to the coal supply obtained earlier, only 35,000 tons, so the Public Works Department advised merchants and the public to conserve electricity as a stopgap measure, and re-employed experts to form a committee to study fair distribution of electricity. To understand whether this move is necessary, a 1940 December 7 statistic is used to analyze the amount of coal required for monthly power generation and the amount of coal consumed by various industries.

Street market public street lights 283

And private street lights 94

Other municipal consumption 633

Shanghai Waterworks Company 890

Shanghai Telephone Company 44

Shanghai Electric Military Company 1,477

Shanghai Fire Company 60

China Motor Bus 67

Household electric lights 1,664

Commercial electric lights 3,888

Household electric lights, etc. 974

Commercial electric furnaces, etc. 832

Other commercial electricity 1,610

Elevator 14

Industrial electricity 32,910

Small horsepower 5,194

French Tram Company 718

A total of 51,349 tons, the coal consumed by industrial members (including the French tram company) accounted for 75% of the total consumption, totaling 38,800 tons, which is more than 13,800 tons more than the current coal supply obtained by the Electric Power Company. As for private electricity consumption, although the time for mandatory restrictions has not yet arrived, if private individuals do not know how to conserve, forced use will be inevitable. Conserving one point of private electricity consumption can increase one point of industrial and commercial electricity consumption. If we use industrial and commercial electricity, it will inevitably be further reduced, and the impact will be that there will be more unemployment, and the future will be unimaginable. (Crane)

### Yarn and Flowers: Fine Yarn Soars, Double Horse Leads to a Lot

The yarn market is trending upward, and the rising trend is gradually strengthening. This is because the foreign exchange has contracted and the standard gold has soared, allowing buyers to be active, resulting in good morale. However, most of the sellers still have no intention of covering, so the rising trend is not very violent. However, the amount absorbed by large firms in the industry is not only not out, but also increasing. As for the actual sales level, the wholesale transactions of Hong Kong gangs are still not seeing much improvement, but the rising trend of 42 counts is sharp, which is quite amazing. The high price of 20 count Double Horse is 1,430 yuan, and the low price is 1,405 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday market closure, speculators dispersed. Someone wanted to buy at 1,430 yuan, it is said. Tomorrow, 170 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Siam, and another 440 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.

The opening market situation of Double Horse in the morning was still peaceful, and the first board price was 1,407 yuan. After a while, it fell slightly to 05 yuan. Immediately after the foreign exchange opened and the standard gold rose, morale suddenly became sharp, and the buying shouts were loud, gradually rising to 1,424 yuan. However, the pressure from the short side was still heavy, and it fell back to 1,419 yuan. However, the gold price was still advancing towards the peak, and the market situation rebounded to 1,430 yuan. However, those who profited spat out and returned down, falling to 1,424 yuan at the close. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 7,950 packages. The amount purchased by each gang is listed separately on the left:

Hong Kong 290 Mainland 10

Fellow Merchants 7,650 Statistics 7,950

### Cotton Prices Become More Strong

The current cotton situation: The raw materials for 42 counts have soared, because the thread price has jumped by more than 100 yuan, so people's hearts are shaking. Those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them. The raw material yarn market for 20 counts is also upward, and the market is in a strong state due to the shrinking foreign exchange, it is said.

The New York cotton market is becoming more firm due to the huge consumption by all parties and the repeated good trade in cotton cloth. As a result, the closing price rose by about 20 pounds.

The Indian cotton market was also affected by New York. First, it rose due to purchases by yarn mills and the general public, and then it rose again due to short covering. Therefore, yesterday's closing price actually rose by more than seven rupees, and at the same time, yesterday's forecast also looked higher by one rupee.

The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction is becoming more active due to the continuous advance of American and cotton. The market situation is becoming more active, and the prices are frequently rising. In addition, the current yarn is stable, and the overall situation is favorable to the long side. Therefore, the general industry is doing business with each other, which is even more lively, but because of Saturday, there are not many transactions. It is expected that a competitive situation will unfold next week.

### Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Fluctuates, Eastern Piece Goods See a Unique Rise

Yesterday's market for factory cloth fluctuated. White goods fluctuated by 2.5 cents. The selling market for coarse cloth is not easy to rise, and the prices of hand goods are all below the factory prices. Recently, it has seen a slight rebound, with each grade continuing to rise by 2.5 cents per piece. The opening price of fine cloth twill is flat, and the price of colored cloth line is up by 1.5 to 5 cents. Bleached cloth is uniquely tired, which is due to the strong or weak needs of the customer gangs. Due to the half-day business hours on Saturday, the transaction was very light, totaling one hundred and several dozen pieces. Zhejiang and Guangdong gangs handled more than one hundred pieces of colored cloth coarse and fine cloth, and the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than two hundred pieces of coarse and fine twill colored cloth line. Tomorrow, there will be one thousand and twenty-five pieces of piece goods shipped to Hong Kong, and another eighty-five pieces shipped to Luo.

Eastern cloth continues to rise, and the situation is becoming more strong. The closing price of white goods Longtou fine cloth in the morning was $48.89, and the gray market was tighter in the afternoon, with an opening of $49.30, an increase of 6-7 cents per piece. Four Gentlemen Serge rose to $1.3625 due to the collection by fellow merchants and hoarders.

### Feather Yarn Ni Sold Smoothly

Feather yarn Ni has a demand from native customer gangs. Wholesale households in the street are particularly fond of it, and Western clothing gangs also have allocations. As the actual sales are approaching, its outlets are expanding step by step. Imported goods are lacking and expensive, so the transaction is naturally more prosperous with local factory goods. (The writer said that according to today's market price of local factory feather yarn Ni, there is more than enough to make imported goods from the old past year), yesterday's Western goods feather yarn Ni generally cost about $29 per yard, Eastern goods $22-23, local factory goods $18-19. Half a yuan should be added to the splitting and zero cutting.

### Sugar Market: Coarse Cart White All Rise

Yesterday's sugar market had more incoming households, and the Vietnam trend was still tight, continuing to see an upward trend. The association's plan to sell spot goods at $81.20 to 50 cents for coarse white, up 30 cents. Orders dated March 20 were $81.40, 50 cents, 70 cents, 80 cents, up 50 cents.

### Seafood: Raw Powder Continues to Tighten

Due to the thin inventory of raw powder and the temporary arrival of goods, the grades are incomplete and continue to rise. Yesterday, the Flying Kylin Mark was priced at $125, Lao Qilin $100, Snake Mark $105, I Mark $110, Double TA Mark $98, Double T Mark $88, Small Pack Eastern Goods $105. It was found that the goods also have a grain relationship, so the tight situation has not ended.

### Thoroughly Clarifying the Rice Market: Rice and Grain Hoarders Must Be Investigated. Resolving to Sanction the Rice Price Is Not Difficult to Suppress. The Gray Market Premium Began to Fall Yesterday. About 70,000 Bags of Tribute Rice Arrived by Foreign Ships Yesterday and Today.

The rice price problem is becoming more serious by the day. Observing the arrival of rice and the number of warehouse stocks, it is obvious that there is no shortage of rice. The matter is obvious and cannot be concealed. Since the two concession authorities have recently seen numerous rumors and rising trends in the rice market, and in view of the fact that the people cannot live and security is worrying, the resident investigators of the rice market were ordered to arrest the bad rice weevils the day before yesterday. The gray market premium only saw a slight decline yesterday. However, the future of rice prices is still serious. Although this initial method seems to be effective, it is feared that it will become negligent over time and it will be difficult to sustain. It must be implemented vigorously and quickly to formulate effective guidelines for unified management, so as to avoid the people's hearts from being disturbed. This is what the citizens of the whole city hope for.

Resolving to Sanction Can Stabilize

After the concession authorities began to take severe measures against illegal rice weevils the day before yesterday, the gray market for rice in the market yesterday slightly fell by two yuan per stone. However, whenever the authorities take severe measures, speculators will temporarily hide. Afterwards, they will relapse. The authorities have decided to continue to investigate and deal with those who engage in illegal transactions in the market, and in order to seek a radical solution, they will also investigate and deal with those who purchase spot goods and hoard them, and those who hoard large quantities of rice and raise prices. Under the authorities' determination to sanction the rice market in this port, it may gradually tend to stabilize. Yesterday, 32,000 bags of rice and grain arrived in this port from overseas producing areas. Statistics show that 210,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in the port last week, and there are still 400,000 bags of foreign rice that have been ordered and can be shipped to this port within this month.

Rice Industry Asks the Authorities for Instructions

In view of the soaring rice prices, which are not only related to the livelihood of the common people but also detrimental to social security, the three rice industry groups, the Shanghai Soybean, Rice, Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry, and the Rice Shop Industry, held a joint temporary meeting the day before yesterday. According to the news revealed by the association yesterday, the three associations will send a joint letter to the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee immediately, requesting that the two concession authorities be asked to give specific instructions to stabilize the people's food, so as to follow. It is reported that the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee has already sent letters to the two concession authorities, in addition to requesting practical assistance, and also asked for instructions on stabilizing the people's food and banning illegal transactions in the rice market. The two authorities have not yet given a formal reply.

Inventory of Rice Storage in Warehouses

The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee's inventory of rice storage for this period (from last Thursday to this Thursday) was completed yesterday. The bottom of the city's (including Pudong, Hongkou, and the Central District) Chinese and foreign rice and grain warehouses reached more than 600,000 bags, of which the most were Taikoo Warehouses, followed by Public and Xiangtai Warehouses. Roosevelt was third, and Zhejiang Xingye, Bank of China, Maotai, etc. were fourth. The above rice storage is limited to each rice warehouse. As for rice shop stores, purchases on behalf of people's food groups, and purchases by citizens, they are not included in the survey. According to an estimate by a rice merchant yesterday, the number of rice hoarded by households and the people exceeds the warehouse storage, so the actual rice storage in Shanghai is close to 2 million bags.

About 70,000 Bags of Rice Arrived Yesterday and Today

The abundant source of foreign rice has been repeatedly recorded in previous reports. It is now known that China Lun Foreign Company's Dedalun directly loaded 47,223 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, of which more than 16,000 bags are broken rice, and there are also 9,803 bags of corn. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docked at Pudong Hongsheng Wharf for unloading. The French wheel Gouver Neur Genral A. Varenne, managed by the company, also loaded 30,048 tons of foreign rice from Saigon, with about 31,000 bags. The French wheel will arrive in Shanghai today and is scheduled to dock at Pudong Longmao Wharf for unloading. There are still a large number of foreign rice arriving later.

### Five British Directors Express: Re-election Campaign; Decision Expected Early Next Week; Japanese Plan Not Revealed

A member of the British Association of this city disclosed yesterday morning (15th) that all five current British directors of the Public Works Department are willing to participate in the board election again this year. It is found that the current five British directors are Kai Ziwei (General Director of the Public Works Department), Hai Lai, McDonald, Mitchell, and Bao Hui'er. It is heard that the British Association has notified its members of this matter and it is expected to be decided early next week. In addition, the Japanese side disclosed yesterday morning that the Japanese have formulated a plan to participate in this year's election of directors of the Public Works Department, but the details have not been revealed. As for the American side, it has nominated Ming Side and Aleman as American candidates in late February.

### Daylight Saving Time Implemented at Midnight

This year's daylight saving time movement was implemented at midnight yesterday. Although the Jianghai Customs will not advance the clock, the office hours of all departments will be advanced by one hour from tomorrow. The announcement is as follows: "From March 17 this year, the office hours of this Customs will be set from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM, and from 12:30 PM to 3:30 PM." As for the curfew time in the two concessions, it will also be implemented one hour earlier according to the daylight saving time movement from today. It is also learned that the city's large and small factories will postpone implementation.

### Shanghai Western Boundary Beyond Patrol Duties To Be Abolished Starting Tomorrow Morning; The Bureau of Works Formally Announced Yesterday; The "Special Police Force" Will Take Over Simultaneously

According to a public notice from the Bureau of Works Information Office, "The Public Concession Police Department's patrol duties in the area outside the western boundary of Shanghai will be abolished starting at 11:00 AM on the 17th of this month (Monday), and will be taken over by the Shanghai Western Special Police Force."

The Final Details Are Still Undecided

The Shanghai Western "Special Police Force" was originally scheduled to be established yesterday (the 15th) morning to take over the area outside the boundary roads, and the Bureau of Works Police Department personnel who were transferred to the "Special Police Force" went to the Special Police Headquarters at 57 Great Western Road yesterday morning. However, the establishment of the "Special Police Force" was postponed to Monday of next week because the "final details" have not yet been resolved. Of those who went to the "Special Police Headquarters" yesterday morning, only "Director-General" Pan Da and "Deputy Director-General" Bai Lanjin Suopu wore special police uniforms. It is said that the postponement of the establishment of the "Special Police Force" yesterday was due to the fact that some details still need to be resolved, and many police uniforms have not yet been made.

It Is Expected to Be Established Tomorrow Morning

According to "Deputy Director-General of the Special Police Headquarters" Kelisha, police officers assigned by the Police Department are expected to be transferred to the "Special Police Force" at 11:00 AM on Monday. At that time, a simple ceremony will be held. Once the "Special Police" start working, it is hoped that they will soon turn bad land into good land and maintain order. Furthermore, Pan Da's scheduled swearing-in ceremony yesterday morning has also been postponed to Monday. It is said that the Public Concession patrols and "Municipal Police" currently working in western Shanghai will all withdraw next week and transfer their responsibilities to the "Special Police Force."

The Tax Revenue Issue Is the Most Contentious

The reasons for the repeated delays in the establishment of the "Special Police" are: first, the personnel issue, which has now been fully decided; and second, the funding issue. It is said that before the tax revenue issue is resolved, the necessary expenses for the "Headquarters" will be temporarily borne by the Ning side. The most difficult negotiation at present is the tax revenue issue. Chen Gongbo's demands are very extravagant. What the Bureau of Works contended for and was unwilling to give up during the tenure of former Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng will now be impossible to maintain in its entirety.

### British Ambassador Sir Cole To Leave Shanghai at the End of This Month; Attended the Royal Air Force Association the Day Before Yesterday; Ridiculed Those Who Go Back on Their Word and Break Promises

British Ambassador to China, Sir Cole, was invited to attend the weekly banquet of the British Royal Air Force Association the day before yesterday (the 14th). During the banquet, the acting president of the association, Holland, gave a speech to welcome him. He said that the president of the association, Sir Sassoon, was unable to attend today. I would like to ask you to raise your glasses to the guest of honor today, Ambassador Cole, to thank the ambassador for his support of the association.

The Ambassador Extravagantly Said Shanghai Is Comfortable

After He spoke, Ambassador Cole stood up and gave a speech, saying that we are now living in an era of "going back on one's word and breaking promises," so how can I be exempt? I was invited to attend this farewell banquet, and I originally intended not to make any remarks, but this verbal agreement can easily be broken. I am very happy to come to Shanghai this time, especially because of the food problem. Although people have different opinions on the food problem, food is one of the two most important things in life. I have enjoyed both since returning to Shanghai, and will continue to do so until the end of this month, because I will be leaving at that time. The Ambassador also compared Chongqing to a rustic village and Shanghai to a luxurious Paris, and said that he had many feelings about going from the countryside to Paris and from frugality to extravagance.

Alexander Gave a Speech

After the Ambassador spoke, Holland invited Alexander, the counselor of the British Embassy, to report on wartime work. Alexander appealed to the British people to make great sacrifices in order to win victory, believing that the closer victory is, the greater the sacrifices will be, until success is achieved. In addition to Ambassador Cole and Alexander, those who attended the weekly banquet of the association yesterday included the Far East intelligence commissioner of the British Embassy, ​​Scott, and the secretary, Menzies, and more than one hundred others.

### Ireland's National Day Tomorrow, Solemn Ceremony, British Ambassador and Others Attending, American Officials Participating

Tomorrow night, Mr. Creek will also broadcast to the Irish expatriates in the city from the XCDN Minsheng Radio Station.

### Anti-Tuberculosis Movement Holds Medical Conference

The population of Shanghai has increased sharply after the war, and the rising prices and difficult living conditions have made the health problems of residents particularly serious. Tuberculosis is spreading even more widely, and the mortality rate has increased sharply compared with before. Leaders from all walks of life in the city and the new medicine and new drug industry have jointly launched an anti-tuberculosis movement. This afternoon at 3:00 PM, a joint medical conference will be held at the YMCA in Baxianqiao in order to expand the movement and achieve great results. Those invited to attend include Nanyang, Jardine Matheson, Shanghai, Hongqiao, Tongde, Dahua, Sino-German, Shanghai Lung Disease, Zhaofeng, Tiren, and more than a dozen groups including the Physicians Association and the Chinese Medical Association to discuss all cooperation methods.

### Economic and Ideological Oppression, Japanese Public Opinion Boils, Daily Food Items Are Lacking, People's Livelihood Is Painful, Epidemics Are Prevalent Everywhere

A recent article in the American Atlantic Magazine stated that the Japanese people, suffering from a long war and enduring pain, have now entered 1941. In military terms, Japan's invasion of China has superficial victories, but the truth of the war lies in the rear of Japan. Tens of millions of Japanese people are suffering from various adverse effects, such as death, disease, lack of food and daily necessities, inflation, etc. Japan is an orderly and controlled people, and they do not complain about the hard work of working 72 hours a week, but they are extremely opposed to restrictions such as only being allowed to use 12 ounces of sugar per month and only being allowed to use four matchsticks per day. Now butter and wheat have disappeared in the country, and milk and rice are very scarce, and the unaffordable cost of living is far beyond the ability of millions of families.

Thought Police Deter Speech

There are many kinds of police rampant in Japan, one is the economic police, and the other is the thought police. Among them, the first category has arrested 688,000 merchants in two years, all of whom were convicted of allegedly selling various goods privately, including food, medicine, gasoline, leather, cotton, etc. The people arrested and imprisoned by the second type of thought police are also counted in the hundreds and thousands, because the people complain about the various sacrifices ordered by the National Spiritual Mobilization Law, and as a result, those who dare to express dissatisfaction at banquets or in street talks are mostly thrown into prison. To this day, there are 1,200 university teachers in prison.

Coarse Food Is Painful

In the huge arms manufacturing industry, the wages of workers are extremely high and they are less affected by rising prices. The most suffering are the white-collar class, such as teachers, students, clerks, and employees. Although prices have increased five times, wages have not increased. The quality of food is extremely low, and the materials for clothing are nothing but fake products made of fiber. The water source needed by 6.5 million people in the Tokyo area is extremely scarce, resulting in the prevalence of diphtheria, scarlet fever, dysentery, etc. Although the government attributes it to early days, it is actually due to the large amount of water used by the munitions factories near Tokyo. Residents who dare to call for insufficient water will be arrested by the thought police, and those who privately use water and electricity exceeding the limit will eventually be arrested by the economic police.

Reduced Agricultural Production, Rice Shortage Is Worrying

The Japanese love fine white rice, which is fresh, tender, and delicious, but the government has ordered that 70% of coarse rice and 30% of fine rice must be mixed in every meal. This measure is entirely to relieve the rice shortage. Due to the lack of labor in Japan, many farmers are lured to work in arms factories by high wages, resulting in less agricultural production. They can only import rice from Annam, Burma, and Siam. However, on the one hand, this kind of rice is rough and does not suit the Japanese taste, and on the other hand, Japan's foreign exchange fund is very empty, which is another drain. If this year's harvest cannot be improved compared with last year, then there is a possibility of famine in Japan and Korea this winter. Due to the shortage of rice, the number of livestock such as chickens and pigs has decreased, and the production of eggs has also become rare.

Economic Collapse Is Not Far Away

Japan banned the sale of cotton fabrics two years ago. Even the 7,000 police officers in Tokyo today no longer wear wool uniforms, but wear all-cotton uniforms. At present, even the cotton used for medical purposes is difficult to purchase except for military use. Other medicines such as iodine, quinine, aspirin, etc. are extremely scarce. In short, there is no prospect of solving all these shortages at present, and it seems that Japan will only have one way out after the end of the war: economic collapse.

### French Merchant Water and Electricity Company Announces Electricity Reduction Measures; Electric Lights Are Not Allowed for Advertisements and Signboards; There Are Other Regulations for Reducing Commonly Used Electricity

The two concession power companies believe that the amount of coal stored in Shanghai is limited and can only supply a few months. If a large amount is not transported to Shanghai, the electricity supply will be affected. Therefore, they have asked residents in the concession to save electricity in order to overcome the current difficulties. The French Concession Water and Electricity Company yesterday specially stipulated restrictions and notified residents in the concession, saying, "For notification purposes, due to the difficulty in fuel supply, the Concession Administration has decided to implement the following measures immediately until further notice. (1)

The supply of electric current for heating is prohibited except for (a) industrial heating, (b) necessary medical equipment, and (c) electric stoves. If users do not comply with this regulation, the supply of electric current will be cancelled immediately. (2)

The supply of electric current for electric lights is not allowed for (a) lanterns, (b) important electric light sign advertisements or decorations, (c) strong illumination of facades such as shops and public places, (d) searchlights or other methods to illuminate the exterior of buildings or various equipment. If users do not comply with this regulation, the supply of electric current will be cancelled immediately. (3)

For users whose monthly consumption of commonly used electricity (referring to the consumption in the same month last year or the consumption in the previous month) exceeds 500 degrees, the portion exceeding 500 degrees of their monthly electricity consumption should be reduced by at least 30% starting from today. If these users violate this regulation in any month, their electricity consumption in that month should be reduced by at least 60%. If they commit the offense again, the supply of electric current will be suspended for a period of at least enough to compensate for the electricity used and should take into account the above reduction measures. (4) For users of electric power and non-prohibited electric lights or electric heating whose monthly consumption of commonly used electricity (explanation as above) exceeds 500 degrees, they should make every effort to control the amount of current they use for the public good. The implementation of this measure should be handled by the Superintendent of the Police Department and the Manager of the French Tramway Electric Light Company within their respective scopes of duties. This is announced."

According to the Pingming News Agency reporter's interview with the Public Concession Power Company yesterday regarding the coal for power generation, the company currently has more than 150,000 tons in storage, and the total amount of coal required daily is more than 1,700 tons. In this way, the stored coal can supply three months of demand. It is expected that after the implementation of the electricity reduction plan, the daily coal demand can be reduced to 1,400 tons. However, this is only a temporary solution. As for the current source of coal, half of it is supplied by the Kaiao Mining Bureau. As for requesting the London government to allocate ships to transport coal, we are waiting for a reply.

### Mrs. French Army Commander Awards Gold Medal of Honor

### Taiwan Disaster Relief Association Remits Money

### White Russian Bodyguard Injures Rickshaw Puller; Chinese and Foreign Passersby Are Uneasy; Detectives Arrive and Take Him to the Police Station

The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 14th) at noon in front of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund, a White Russian bodyguard named Telaitov had a fight with a rickshaw puller and even pulled out a pistol to injure someone, resulting in his arrest by the police. The incident was caused by two Japanese women taking a rickshaw to the vicinity of the Huizhong Hotel. The puller shouted after them because the fare they gave was too low. The two women ignored him, and the puller was extremely angry and pushed the women. At that time, Telaitov was standing next to his Chinese employer's car (registration number 10198). Seeing this, he tried to stop him and had a fight with the puller. The White Russian was held by the puller and could not break free. Enraged, he suddenly

Pulled out a pistol and hit the puller's head with the butt of the gun, causing him to bleed profusely. Among the crowd of onlookers on the side of the road, a Westerner, seeing this, stepped forward bravely and punched the White Russian in the face. A Chinese also stepped forward and joined in seizing the White Russian's pistol. At that time, an old woman in the crowd mistakenly identified a German Jewish refugee as the perpetrator.

She pulled him tightly and shouted that he had nothing to do with it. After a while, a patrol officer and a Western detective arrived and dispersed the crowd. After asking about the situation, they took the White Russian to the police station for detention.

### Traveler Dies in Room, Head Has Gunshot Wound, Suspected of Committing Suicide by Shooting

Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, a traveler in a dark gray suit came to the Datong Hotel on Nanjing Road to rent a room. The waiter led him to room 203 on the second floor and paid 20 yuan for the room. He wrote down his name as Wang Shoumin, a local, 30 years old, in the registration book. He then went out, and in less than half an hour, he returned, going back and forth three or four times. After returning to the hotel at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, there was no movement.

The waiter on duty, who had closed the door tightly, did not suspect anything at first. It was not until after 9:00 PM that the early shift waiter had left work and the night shift waiter, No. 23, noticed that the room had not rung for a long time, and became suspicious. So he went to knock on the door, but there was no response for a long time. He peered through the keyhole, but could not see anything. So he climbed up a wooden ladder and opened the glass window above, and saw that the electric light in the room was bright, and a corpse was curled up in front of the bed. He knew that the guest had committed suicide without a doubt, and immediately reported the information to the accounting room, which was forwarded to the Old Gate Police Station. Detectives rushed to the scene, found a pistol next to the corpse, and found more than 100 yuan in national currency and a bunch of keys in his pocket. They took photos of the corpse in the room and waited for the family to claim it. Then they called an ambulance and sent the corpse to the coroner's office for examination. As for the name Wang Shoumin, whether it was a pseudonym, and the cause of death, the police station is currently investigating.

### Robbery on Mike Gao Paul Road, Chinese Police Officer Shot, Stray Bullet Wounds Rickshaw Puller, Two Robbers Escape Without a Trace

At around 8:75 PM last night, at the Yida Rice Store at No. 30 Mike Gao Paul Road in the French Concession, the store had closed its doors. Suddenly, two robbers, pretending to buy rice, tricked the store to open the door and entered. They both took out pistols and threatened the store owner and clerks. As a result, they grabbed 50 yuan in national currency from the counter and fled. At that time, they happened to meet Chinese and Western detectives from the French Police Station on patrol. They shouted for them to stop and be searched. Unexpectedly, the robbers took the lead and opened fire to resist arrest. The police also pulled out their guns and returned fire. Both sides exchanged more than a dozen shots. As a result, Chinese police officer No. 226 was shot in the back, and a stray bullet hit the left back of rickshaw puller Hang Chaodang (28 years old, from Jiangbei), causing him to bleed profusely. Because the area was crowded, the two robbers eventually escaped into the crowd without a trace. The wounded police officer and rickshaw puller were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

### Farmer Carrying a Bag of Rice Actually Shot

The Continental Daily reported that at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a farmer was walking on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai carrying a bag of rice, presumably intending to smuggle rice into the Public Concession. He was stopped by a "Municipal Police" officer, and an argument broke out. The farmer was shot in the chest by the "Police" officer and was sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Dentist and Mother-in-Law Cohabit, Suddenly Develop Rift and Litigate, Accuse Xiao of Intended Injury and Abandonment, Xiao Denies Everything, Judge Advises Reconciliation

Ren Junming, a Cantonese dentist, lives at No. 15, Lane 229, Baker Road. He has a clinic on Lloyd Road. Twenty-five years ago, he married a woman surnamed Lin from the same province. Ren's father-in-law, Mr. Lin, remarried a woman surnamed Xiao from Gansu Road (16 years old at the time) as his second wife because of the pain of losing his wife. When Xiao was 28 years old, Mr. Lin passed away. Ren Junming, as a son-in-law, often went to offer condolences. At that time, Xiao was still young and had good looks, and had more private savings, which led to a long period of friction. Ren actually had an affair with Xiao.

He then cohabited, and Ren even divorced Ms. Lin twelve years ago because of his relationship with Xiao. Xiao then officially cohabited with Ren and his mother, Ren Tang, and sister, Ren Zijun, causing Xiao to run out of money. And now that she is 41 years old, her looks have faded, and she has become resentful. On the 27th of last month, Ren Tang and her daughter-in-law, Ren Xiao, had a conflict over a trivial matter of using boiling water. At that time, Ren's sister, Zijun, also joined in. Later, Ren Zijun reported to the New Gate Police Station that Ren Xiao had injured her with a kettle. After the Chinese detective Ye Yushan ordered her to go to the

Hospital for examination, the results proved that Ren Zijun had minor injuries to her face and chest. He then filed a complaint against Ren Xiao with the Special First Court. This morning, Judge Meng Tingke opened the Criminal Court Eight to summon her. The police station lawyer Peng Qiqi prosecuted her for the crime of injury. When asked by Ren Xiao, she denied the injury and hired lawyer Ge Zhaoji to defend her. Lawyer Ge presented a letter from Ren Junming, which stated that Xiao and Ren Junming were originally in a relationship of son-in-law and mother-in-law. Since her husband's death, Ren took advantage of her wealth and used all means to seduce her and become promiscuous. Later, she remarried to a man surnamed Guan in Hong Kong. Ren

He used all means to harass her and force her to flee to Guangzhou with him. He came to Shanghai in 1935 to practice medicine. All the medical equipment and household expenses were paid by her with her private savings. Now Ren saw that she was running out of money and suddenly had bad intentions. He abused her first and then falsely accused her of injury in order to achieve the purpose of abandoning her. After reviewing the case, the court ordered that the case be postponed for further hearing, advised both parties to go out and reconcile, and ordered Ren Junming to appear in court at the next hearing.

### Youth Fan Chengji Sent a Letter of Threat, Sentenced to Four Months in Prison

Fan Chengji, a Ningbo youth who lives at No. 7, Lane 142, Malan Road, recently joined the Youth Association as a member. After paying a membership fee of 25 yuan, the association did not issue a membership card in time, so it first gave him a receipt. Before the 17th of last month, Fan took the receipt to the Youth Association on Sichuan Road to take a bath, but was refused by the staff. Fan questioned the reason, which led to a conflict with the association's staff. Afterwards, Fan was refunded his membership fee by Guan Ganzhong, the director of the general association, and was refused membership without explaining the reason. Fan, who was young and energetic, actually wrote two letters, each with an eye drawn on it, and the words "Be careful of your life," and attached a bullet to each letter, which were sent to the two staff members of the association. However, afterwards, Fan asked himself whether this action violated the law and was against his conscience, so he surrendered himself to the Central Police Station the day before yesterday. After an investigation by Chinese detective Ren Fengwu, he was sent to the Criminal Court Four of the Special First Court this morning. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him under Article 305 of the Criminal Law. After being questioned by Judge Fei, Fan Chengji was sentenced to four months in prison and allowed to pay a fine of two yuan per day in lieu of imprisonment. The threatening letters were confiscated.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:
I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Pang Likang, who claims that the news item "Counterfeit Transport Permits" published in the Shanghai local news section of the Shen Bao on the 15th of this month does not conform to the facts. After investigation, my client is a legitimate businessman. Previously, Mr. Zhu, the manager of the San Tai Cotton Cloth Shop, wanted to transport goods to another port and needed a transport permit. My client then indirectly introduced him to Wu A'gen, who was recommended by Wang Zao, to handle the matter. My client was not involved in the matter of the counterfeit transport permits and was not aware of the situation. The court acquitted my client and issued an official notice of innocence. The newspaper report stated that my client was sentenced to three months of imprisonment, which is inconsistent with the facts. It appears that there was a mistake in the reporting. This report is related to my client’s reputation and I request that your newspaper issue a statement clarifying the matter to protect his reputation and to adhere to the facts. Therefore, I am writing to you, hoping that you will investigate and issue a correction. Sincerely, Zhou Shiying, Lawyer, March 15th.

Children's Weekly

### Methods of Studying

— Yuan Shan

Speaking of methods of studying, I remember when I was in elementary school, a teacher once explained a very clear and reasonable method to us: now let me record it below and present it to you children for your use.

He said: "The method of studying should be like a shopkeeper's bookkeeping; the shopkeeper must keep accounts every day, and we must also clarify and review our lessons every day. A shopkeeper cannot stop keeping accounts for a few days, and then record the unrecorded accounts of the previous few days on one day. Because such bookkeeping is bound to lack detailed and accurate content. Our studying is also like this. We cannot stop reviewing our lessons for a few days, and then review several days’ worth of lessons on another day; otherwise, it will make us confused and unclear. Furthermore, the shopkeeper must check the accounts every week and every month to see if the shop has made money or lost money in this week and this month. Our studying should also be checked every week and every month to see what lessons are not remembered very clearly or have been forgotten. If so, we should think of ways to clarify and familiarize ourselves with them. If we study in this way, it will definitely be effective."

### About Airplanes

— Jin Zhen

Since the outbreak of war, airplanes have truly been in the limelight, bombing to the east, reconnaissance to the west, killing everywhere, destroying everywhere, which shows that they are exceptionally active in the sky. A Hui is already used to airplanes, and has suffered greatly from them: forcing his family to flee and finally manage to take refuge in Shanghai, for a full four years. Although he often looked up at those airplanes, the rumbling sound of the engines as they flew over his head pierced his ears, and he only felt a little different. At this time, he suddenly wanted to know more about airplanes, so he asked his father.

"When an airplane on the ground wants to take off, it must taxi for a certain distance until the air density under the wings reaches a certain level before it can slowly rise. Therefore, the airfield must have a large area. If, when flying an airplane, the propeller at the front sends air to the back of the airplane, and the wind on the ground blows back from the front, like a ship sailing with the wind, then the airplane cannot fly. Therefore, airplanes must take off and land against the wind. So the airfield must have a cylindrical wind sock hanging on a high pole. When the airplane is taking off and landing, it must aim at the tail of the wind sock, which is clear proof of flying against the wind. During the early days of the First World War in Europe, when airplanes were first used in war, bombs were placed in the pilot's seat. When bombing, the pilot would hold the bomb in his hands and throw it down, which was very inconvenient and difficult to hit the target. Fortunately, the bombs at that time were mostly small. If there were half-ton bombs, how could a pilot handle them? Later, the bombs were all installed under the wings or fuselage. As long as the mechanism was activated and the bomb clips were opened, the bombs would automatically fall, which was much more convenient and greatly increased the effectiveness of bombing. An airplane has two fixed machine guns. If it is a fighter plane, it has more than two. The bullets are fired from between the propeller wings, which is most powerful. Firing backwards is less convenient, so protecting the airplane's tail rudder is most difficult, because when firing backwards, one must be careful not to hit the tail rudder of one's own airplane. One is often taken advantage of by the opponent, leading to utter defeat. Therefore, airplanes now often fly in formation, with every three airplanes arranged in a chevron or triangle, with the two airplanes behind protecting the tail of the one in front, which is also the reason..." Father suddenly stopped here because Mother was calling him.

### Why Be Punctual?

— Shao Ruiying

"Not being punctual" is an old habit of us Chinese, so, as children of Chinese people, we are naturally no exception. Dear children, would you like to be an "unpunctual" child? If not, quickly start being punctual from today! The reason why Chinese people are "unpunctual" is that they did not develop the habit of "being punctual" in childhood. Therefore, children must pay absolute attention to this issue of "being punctual"!

Why should we "be punctual"? Because time, once gone, never returns. Mr. Zhu Ziqing said it very well: "When the leaves wither, they turn green again. When the swallows leave, they return again. When time passes, can it return again? Smart children, tell me. When time passes, can it return again?" Although I am not smart, I dare to assert that time will not return. So how many benefits are there to being punctual?

First, it saves time. Like our train, which leaves at 2 o'clock, if you arrive at the station at 2:15, the train has already left, and you have to wait for the next train. Isn't the time in between wasted? Being punctual avoids this, so isn't that a benefit of "being punctual"?

Second, it avoids delaying things. If you are not punctual and miss the train, you will not be able to reach your destination. At this time, the work you need to do will be delayed. If it is an important matter, related to the overall situation, wouldn't it delay the affairs of many people? Being punctual avoids this, so isn't that a benefit of "being punctual"?

Third, it maintains order. Like a meeting, which is scheduled to be held at a certain place on a certain morning at a certain time, some members arrive at 8:30, while others arrive at 9:30. With people arriving at different times, how can the meeting place not be chaotic? Where can we talk about order? Being punctual avoids this, so isn't that an advantage of "being punctual"?

Fourth, it increases efficiency. Because you are not punctual, the work you do will definitely not be more than others. If punctual people do two things, you can only do one thing. If you are also punctual, the efficiency of your work will not be like this, so isn't that a benefit of "being punctual"?

### The Conversation Between Sand and Mud

— Luo Ying

One day, Sand and Mud met. Each boasted about itself, so they began to quarrel. Sand said: "How clumsy you are, lying on the ground and by the river all day long. Look how free I am, flying around, how happy!"

Mud said unconvincedly: "What's so happy about you? When Brother Wind tells you to go west, you don't dare to go east, when he tells you to go east, you don't dare to go west; being controlled by others and being a slave to others, what's so carefree about that? Also, your companions are all scattered, each going its own way. Look how united we are!" Sand had no words to answer.

Smart children, please carefully fill in the small black dots so you can know who this is? Drawing by Zhang Jingyu

### Kang Yuan Toy Essay Contest, Parents' Category, First Place: My Child and Kang Yuan Toys

— Fang Wenyu

Four years ago, one spring day, the breeze was gentle, the sun was warm, the island was filled with flowers, which aroused our desire for an outing. So, our family invited Mr. D's family to go to Longhua to see the peach blossoms. Hearing about the outing, the children were very happy, but Yan'er had just recovered from measles and could not be exposed to the wind. Seeing so many of us going, while he was left alone at home, he was naturally very sad. But there was no way because of his illness, so he made a deal with me, asking me to bring him a toy when I returned home.

I fulfilled my promise. When I returned from the outing, I went to the National Goods Company alone and bought a jumping frog made by Kang Yuan Factory. When I got home, I silently wound it up and placed it on the floor. The frog jumped back and forth, just like a real one. Yan'er watched and clapped his hands and cheered. I said that it was caught in the fields of Longhua, and he blamed me for not catching a few more.

The frog stopped jumping after a while, so I picked it up and taught Yan'er how to wind it up, but Yan'er was still skeptical and dared not move. This made his older brother Hong'er regret following us. He said, if he had known it would be like this, he would have preferred to stay at home and play with something interesting.

Later, seeing that Hong'er really envied his younger brother so much, and Yan'er refused to take out the frog to play with, I went and bought a Kang Yuan Factory car for Hong'er. He was also very happy, crawling on the floor all day, driving the car, shouting, "Ooh ooh ooh, the car is coming, make way, make way!"

When the August 13th Incident broke out, the heroes defending the country were often showing their power in the air. Whenever the children heard the sound of planes, they would raise their heads to look, frequently clapping and cheering, especially after the bombing of the Izumo warship, which aroused the children's envy even more.

I bought an airplane for Hong'er and a fire-shooting machine gun for Yan'er, which were also products of Kang Yuan Factory. Who knew that they would fight all day long? Either Yan'er said that his older brother was flying the airplane and bombing to scare him, or Hong'er cried and told me that his younger brother was shooting at him with the machine gun. I often couldn't settle the dispute.

One day, they were arguing again. Yan'er ran to tell me that Hong'er had broken all the toys. He wanted Hong'er to pay for them, but Hong'er refused. So I asked Hong'er how he had broken the toys. According to Hong'er, he didn't know why the airplane could move, why the machine gun could fire, and why the frog could jump, so he disassembled them one by one to find out. But he knew that it was easy to destroy but difficult to build. Hearing that his beloved toys had been broken by his older brother, Yan'er wanted him to pay for them, so they had a dispute. Knowing the reason, and seeing the disassembled toy parts, I felt that Hong'er's curiosity was a manifestation of a child's instinct, which we should make good use of and guide. On the other hand, I felt that Yan'er's demand for compensation was also justified. So I helped Hong'er spend an afternoon assembling the disassembled toys: the frog could jump again, the fire-shooting machine gun could shoot out sparks again, and the wheels of the airplane could turn again. Yan'er smiled, and Hong'er was even happier.

While working, they both concentrated and helped me assemble the toys. At the same time, I told them the principle of why the frog could jump, why the airplane could move, and why the machine gun could fire; I also told them that we should not be afraid of destruction, but we should be most afraid of not being able to build after destruction. Seeing their four bright little eyes staring at me, I knew that they understood what I said to some extent. From then on, they understood Kang Yuan toys more intimately. I am very grateful to Kang Yuan toys for giving my children a practical education and training.

Finally, I have one more suggestion to contribute to Kang Yuan Factory. I remember a friend who returned from Japan brought me a Japanese children's toy: a clock. The parts of the clock toy were separated, with assembly diagrams and instructions. Children could assemble it by following the diagrams and instructions. After the assembly was completed, as long as you wound it up, it would tick-tock. What a meaningful toy! I think if Kang Yuan Factory could offer such toys, not necessarily clocks, but other things like cars and airplanes, with all the parts disassembled and sold with assembly diagrams and instructions, allowing children to assemble them themselves, it would not only teach children about mechanical knowledge but also train the use of their small muscles. What a meaningful thing that would be!

New Movie Introduction

### "Chronicle of Heroes' Bloody Battles"

— Mo Ye

Revolution is a very arduous task. It will encounter stubborn resistance from the established system, and it will cruelly set up many traps to make you surrender and destroy yourself. Therefore, our revolutionary actions are by no means something that can be achieved by shouting a few slogans and writing a few posters. It requires sacrifice and irrigation to grow brilliant flowers on barren land!

It is a fact that the people of Russia, with tears in their eyes, endured everything and struggled under a life of suffering. Cruel, dark, and murderous, the Tsar and all the aristocratic classes relied on these vicious methods to carry out the most despicable actions and became the executioners of tens of millions of people. We have seen "Pugachev" and felt our hearts burning with anger! We have also shed tears while watching "Chapayev" with excitement and indignation; and we have seen "Female Hero" which describes a pitiful, tragic, and miserable life.

As historical films, they use progressive viewpoints, stand on a higher level, and use the most tragic facts to educate later generations and inspire future generations with strategies and methods of struggle.

It is an epic of struggle, a march praising the revolution! "Chronicle of Heroes' Bloody Battles" undoubtedly deserves to be admired. It explains the reasons for the failure of the struggle more than "Pugachev," and it describes the heroic struggle of the proletariat more diligently than "Chapayev"!

The screenwriter uses the special convenience of film to give this protagonist – Shi Jibang La Jing – a soldier of humble origin – a profound portrayal of this great figure. In the process of revolution, only the proletariat is the most determined group, and what they maintain is a heart of justice and sincerity for the struggle for national liberation.

In this film, we see the power of the masses and the tendency of the people. The director has excellent skills. He emphasizes Shi Jibang La Jing's determination and criticizes the fact that unplanned actions will lead to failure. Especially at the end, Peter Luo’s and others’ facial muscles are tense, and the masses lower their heads and shed tears, which contrasts with how much the people mourn the martyrdom of this hero.

Truly, this is a magnificent, majestic, and rough giant painting!

### Blood Rain and Exquisite Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter Two: Brave Warriors from the North Show Their Skills

Zhang Cangqiu heard that Xu Jing had been hit by a hidden weapon and fallen behind him. Although he wanted to turn back to help, he was furious in his heart and refused to let the enemy go. He stomped his feet, chased after him, and shouted, "You dog thief, dare to hurt people with hidden weapons! Tonight, even if you go to heaven, I will catch up to you in heaven, and if you enter the earth, I will chase you down to earth. Where do you think you can escape?" The man ran while still not answering. With a twist of his body, another sleeve arrow flew towards Zhang Cangqiu's chest. Zhang Cangqiu swept his precious sword downwards, knocking the sleeve arrow to the ground. He then said, "How many sleeve arrows do you have? Just keep shooting them all." Seeing that the two arrows had missed him, the man was a little panicked. Just as he was about to shoot the third arrow, he stumbled on a stone and couldn't help but fall down. Zhang Cangqiu was overjoyed and sprinted in front of the man, raising his sword to strike down. But the man suddenly performed a carp leap, jumped up, and swung a hammer backhand towards Zhang Cangqiu's waist. Zhang Cangqiu missed his strike, and the hammer had already reached his waist. He had no choice but to jump forward, dodging the hammer, and turning around to swing his sword at the man's lower body. The two fought together again. Zhang Cangqiu was determined to catch him and would not let him go. The man only had a hammer in his hand and was afraid of being cut by Zhang Cangqiu's precious sword, so he struggled for a dozen moves before fleeing again towards the official road ahead. Zhang Cangqiu couldn't catch him and was burning with anger. He hurriedly chased after him, thinking that this guy's night walking and jumping skills were indeed good. If he escapes, how can I face Xu Jing? And I don't know how Xu Jing is doing after being injured? While thinking, he chased after him. He could see the city walls ahead, and there was a large manor on the east side of the official road, surrounded by winding walls, indicating a wealthy family. The man ran to the back of the manor, leaped up, and was already on the wall, falling into the manor. Zhang Cangqiu thought that this must be a den of thieves. Since he has already come here, no matter if it is a tiger's den or a dragon's pool, he must chase him in. So he followed with a leap and also reached the wall. (End of Chapter Two)
