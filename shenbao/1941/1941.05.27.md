Editorial

### The Aspirations of the Shanghai Market

The fourth month is passing, tea and silk are coming to market, and the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching. This is usually the most prosperous and active time for the financial industry, but it is not so now. Just look at the state of leisure and idleness, and it is self-evident. Interest rates are low, and the discount on spot cash and drafts is between fifty cents and one yuan. It even goes to the point of creating new tricks. Spot cash and head transfers, which are normally the same thing, are now demanding a Shenshui premium, meaning that even for transactions of thousands of dollars, a difference of one or two yuan is clearly distinguished. This is not a reasonable action, but it reflects the abnormal Shanghai market: there is plenty of cash and abundant floating capital. The financial industry is very calculating and meticulous, hence this abnormal situation.

On the other hand, since the U.S. Congressional committee passed a resolution authorizing the President to continue devaluing the U.S. dollar, the Shanghai market had a brief surge of excitement, but it eventually calmed down. The possibility of further devaluation of the U.S. dollar is not new, and the way the situation develops is what is needed to adapt to the times. Not to mention further devaluation of the U.S. dollar, any other necessary measures will emerge as needed. The public does not need to be surprised by this, and this kind of action still contains constructive elements and is not entirely destructive in wartime. As long as we recognize the trend of the ABC countries continuing to cooperate, with their economies closely linked and forming a single circle, we will eventually see the reality of coexistence and co-prosperity.

Leaving aside other things, the legal tender has gone through four years of war experience. Sure enough, the Shanghai black market has undergone several changes, but the trend in the past year has remained one of meandering and twisting. Despite pointless rumors and manipulations, it has eventually returned to its original state. It is difficult to predict future trends, but considering that the equalization fund loan from Britain and the United States has been achieved, the equalization fund committee will soon be established in Chongqing, and the American members are already on their way to Chongqing. With this connection, regardless of whether there are changes in the Shanghai black market, in short, the legal tender is the legal tender, and there is no need to worry like the man of Qi fearing the sky.

On another front, speculation and hoarding in the Shanghai market, since the Public Concession sold rice on the market, using its strength to defeat the various price-gouging tactics of the rice weevils and hoarders, have actually had a resounding effect. Not to mention flour, wheat, and mixed grains, which have a related connection, have all seen a fall in prices. Even cotton yarn and cloth have lost their interest and the market is declining. The rise and fall of speculation depends on momentum. Once the momentum declines, everything loses its energy, and it is not easy to revive unless another opportunity is borrowed. Therefore, the speculation in rice has been quelled, and other speculations have also lost their luster. Although they have not disappeared completely, they are no longer thriving. This shows that to control the market, you must rely on strength and have the determination. If you are superficial and deceptive, just putting on a show, it is not only like ladling soup to stop boiling, but also like accumulating fuel under a pot.

Looking at the market, all industries have made large profits over the years, but this is not really a gain. First, the quantity of goods is still the same, and the constant rise in prices makes the profits seem impressive. Second, the amount of currency has indeed increased, but its effect is that all goods have risen sharply in the same way, ultimately offsetting the increase in quantity and more. Third, all labor costs are also relatively increased with prices, and expenses are huge. If business is slightly slow, it may be a losing proposition. Fourth, unless prices continue to rise, all industries can still enjoy the benefits. However, prices are already high, which ultimately limits purchasing power. As long as consumers retreat and settle for second best, or even save where they can and postpone what they can, it is enough to affect sales. And when goods cannot be sold, even if there is clearly a profit, it is just a paper gain. In reality, if interest on loans and other expenses are included, who knows if it is not a loss.

Therefore, the current situation of all industries is fraught with the risk of depreciation and loss. Prices do not have to fall; as long as they reach a standstill, there is no profit to be made, and there is the possibility of sitting and eroding expenses. Therefore, those who seek huge profits do not hesitate to exhaust all kinds of manipulative and speculative tricks, still hoping to obtain undue gains. But they do not consider that hoarding and price-gouging are only most effective under two conditions: (1) if it is indispensable, with no alternative; (2) if the power of purchasing and selling, and the supply of goods, cannot be obtained in a short time. Even in these two cases, it is not as stable as Mount Tai. Humans are good at adapting to the environment, and temporary difficulties will eventually be overcome. Otherwise, since the beginning of humanity, not only have there been man-made atrocities, but also the natural world has been filled with countless disasters and tribulations, and humanity has finally been able to thrive because it has been able to conquer the environment. Therefore, the various efforts of speculators will ultimately be a flash in the pan, and they will only be like moths flying into a flame, burning themselves!

Now, what is no less serious than food and clothing is the problem of housing. Real estate was originally used for investment, so its profits were very thin. But now that everything is speculative, the buying and selling of real estate has also lost its proper track, becoming a speculative object for those with surplus capital. In particular, since the arrival of a group of Jews in Shanghai, the Shanghai stock and real estate industries have experienced great fluctuations, directly fueling speculation, indirectly raising prices, and creating the fact that rents are repeatedly increased, oppressing tenants. It is nothing more than using sales, subleases, demolition, changes in management accounting rooms, and borrowing the power of foreigners to carry out their rent increase methods. Large landlords oppress second landlords, and second landlords exploit third tenants. Today, most residents of Shanghai, except for a few who have assets and have become rich through hoarding, are mostly not well-fed and have no peace of mind. The seriousness of the problem of high rents will inevitably lead to more and more people living in divided rooms, the rooms becoming narrower, and the people becoming more crowded. This is not only dirty and filthy, but also prone to fire and epidemics. In the end, it will affect the safety of the entire society. Therefore, while speculating on food should be guarded against, speculating on real estate, increasing rents as much as possible, and forcing the reduction of living space, is also a kind of atrocious act that threatens life and should be banned.

On the whole, people are now envying Shanghai's prosperity, but they do not know that the content is full of dark shadows, and no one knows when it will explode! Tools, we are already approaching this goal with an unprecedented rate of production, what I bring now from the United States, is a belief held by our American people, that is, we believe that the principles believed by the people of your country and the United States will last forever, this career, is very great, although the path may be very far, but can be achieved with tense efforts," Chairman Lin replied, "In the supreme struggle for self-preservation and for the preservation of the inalienable rights of human life, liberty, and happiness, the Chinese government is very pleased with the principles and objectives to which the American government and people are dedicated, and is grateful for the various assistances that have been obtained and will continue to be provided in the future, the Chinese people and other peace-loving countries have infinite admiration for the great policy of the American government in making America the arsenal of democratic countries, China, like other free and resolute nations, looks to America as the last guarantee of civilization, China can be honored to share the sorrows and difficulties with the United States, and believes that the doctrines advocated and maintained by China and the United States will exist." Dr. Duan Maolan, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, served as the translator in the ceremony. After the presentation of the letter of credence, Chairman Lin held a public banquet for the American diplomatic representatives. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, Wang Chonghui, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, Xu Mo, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and many other foreign officials attended the public banquet.

It was a twin-engine bomber, and there were four charred corpses in the plane. Another two Japanese planes were damaged in the battle. When the Japanese planes returned after the battle, only 25 remained. Therefore, it is widely believed that another one crashed, but its wreckage has not been found.

### Zhou Enlai Calls for Unity of Army and People to Crush Japanese Divisive Plots; Break Japanese Blockade and Prepare for Counterattack

Chongqing - Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the Military Commission and the Communist Party's representative in Chongqing, recently published a special article in the Xinhua Daily, calling on the people and army of the whole country to unite to overcome current and future difficulties, to crush Japan's divisive plots, and to mobilize democratic forces to break the Japanese blockade, so as to prepare for a counter-attack. Zhou believes that the current war will continue to expand and be prolonged, but does not believe that there will be a conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union's foreign policy is aimed at peace and neutrality. Unless Germany changes its policy towards Britain, it will not want to fight on two fronts. Zhou went on to say that the center of gravity of the war between Britain and the United States is in the Atlantic, not the Pacific. Although Britain and the United States will not re-close the Yunnan-Burma Road or recognize Japan's Asian Monroe Doctrine, it is not impossible for them to adopt a moderate attitude towards Japan in the hope of delaying the outbreak of the Pacific War. Although China's policy of resistance and nation-building is independent and autonomous, it does not want to be involved in the imperialist world war. However, this does not mean that we should not make use of the contradictions between imperialists, especially the contradictions and conflicts between Britain, the United States, and Japan.

### Aid China Week Closes; Wilkie Delivers Speech: Says China is the World's Outpost of Freedom; America Should Aid China to Resist Aggression

New York - Wilkie yesterday, at the close of "Aid China Week" broadcasting, appealed for increased aid to China, because "China is the outpost of freedom in a world where freedom's edge is gradually tightening." Wilkie stated, "We should not turn a deaf ear to this appeal. We all recognize that countries around the world, whether in Europe or Asia, are fighting for the form of life and government they desire. The people of America should be determined to defend this outpost of freedom. Many people talk about not wanting to participate in the war, and some are concerned with keeping America out of the war." Wilkie urged the audience not to be misled by "impractical shallow views." He said, "When I am helping to put out a fire, I will not stand by and argue with the fire chief. The edge of freedom is tightening. People of America, I urge you to unite! If we stand strong with the countries fighting for democracy, we will surely win." New York Governor Lehman, New York Mayor LaGuardia, and Chinese Consul General in New York, Dr. Yu Tsune-chi, also spoke during the broadcast. Wilkie's speech was one of the greatest expressions of Sino-American friendship seen here in recent years. At the close of "Aid China Week," thousands of Chinese and Americans participated in a large parade. Other American cities also held similar celebrations. In Washington, 7,000 Chinese marched, along with 2,500 American students. In the New York parade, there were 150 overseas Chinese who danced a long dragon. New York National Guard Chief of Staff Hubbell was the grand marshal of the parade, leading the procession. Wilkie, Governor Lehman, city council members, and other important figures were on the reviewing stand. The New York Times also published a commentary on "Aid China Week," stating that there was no evidence to prove the Japanese claims of victories in Shanxi and Zhejiang meant the Japanese army had consolidated its new positions. The newspaper said, "The fall of Zhuji into the hands of the Chinese army is said to be a voluntary withdrawal. This is a clumsy way to present victory to the weary and doubtful Japanese people. The Japanese military has failed to prove during China Week that American aid to China is aiding a loser. If China can get a lot of help, it may open up the predicament and keep the Japanese army busy and unable to cause trouble elsewhere." (United Press dispatch, 26th)

New York - American Republican leader Wilkie and New York Governor Lehman spoke yesterday at the close of the "Aid China Week" parade to thousands of people gathered at Columbus Circle, saying that the American people are now facing a major crisis. All Americans must stand on the same front with the democratic countries of the world to attack the aggressors. Wilkie also called on the United States to increase aid to China, because China is the outpost of freedom in the world, and now that outpost is feeling threatened. Wilkie's speech was broadcast. Wilkie said, "I am speaking today because I have a great concern for the country we love. We are now facing the most difficult crisis in history. Omnipotent countries with aggressive ambitions are trying to conquer the free nations of the world. Therefore, we should provide assistance to China, which is currently in need of help, and aiding China is an extremely correct truth, because China is our American outpost. Any event encountered in our East will also subject our West to the same treatment." Wilkie also said that he hoped President Roosevelt would give a straightforward, powerful, and courageous speech in his fireside chat on Tuesday night to promote the unity of the American people. Governor Lehman said in his speech that the United States must recognize China's firm determination to defend its freedom when threatened. China is now resolutely resisting evil forces, just as the United States is rising up to meet any possible threat. China now needs our help. If we can help them, China can continue to fight, or even win. We should not forget what the Chinese people have done for democracy, for freedom, and for the people of the world. It must be known that China is the first country to refuse to bow to aggressors and bullies. New York Acting Mayor Morris also delivered a speech, saying, "Tomorrow's storm will be a brutal storm. ABC (that is, America, Britain, and China) will unite to defend it." Of the three speeches, Wilkie's was the longest and most forcefully stated the necessity of aiding China. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### US Senator Urges Escort, Intensify Aid to Democratic Nations

Washington - The opinions expressed yesterday by two senior senators who often speak for the administration may indicate the direction of President Roosevelt's fireside chat on Tuesday. Democratic Senator Guffey, in a broadcast speech, demanded that the United States should escort goods to Britain. Democratic Senator Mead of New York, in a letter to Secretary of State Hull, demanded "immediate forceful seizure of the French territories in the Western Hemisphere," unless Vichy agrees to the United States using them as a base. Senator Guffey said, "We only have two choices now. If we do not escort now, we will be at war in the future." Florida Democratic Senator Pepper, who is considered to be a government spokesman, began a speaking tour to Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Detroit, urging increased aid to democratic countries. Pepper issued a statement saying, "The future of the world will be decided in the next five months. If we can hold on until November 1st, Hitler will not be able to conquer the world. Britain must obtain military raw materials and food, and the world's sea lanes must continue to be open. Our production rate must be accelerated by at least 50 percent." (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Chicago - Gallup Poll leader Gallup said here yesterday that more than half of the American people have not yet decided on the question of whether or not to go to war. Gallup said that the results of his research institute's recent tests show that those who support going to war account for 21 percent, and those who insist on not going to war no matter what, even if the Axis wins and Britain is defeated, account for 24 percent. There are still 50 percent, accounting for approximately 2.5 million to 3 million votes, who have not yet decided. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### After the Sinking of the HMS Hood, the United States Will Make Important Decisions

Washington - After the British battlecruiser HMS Hood was sunk by Germany, members of Congress openly advocated giving Britain more effective aid, but are waiting for the White House to provide a more decisive plan immediately. It is expected that the President's fireside chat yesterday will not only indicate the speed of increased aid, but may also indicate accelerating America's own defense actions. The President's closest advisor, Rosenman, spent the end of this week with the President and helped him draft the text of his address to the nation. Rosenman's actions are enough to prove that the President will announce a grander plan, because it is extremely noteworthy for a judge to assist the head of the executive branch in preparing important documents. Nebraska Independent Senator Norris said that if the President's view is to use many warships to escort British convoys in the North Atlantic in order to save major shipping losses and enhance the anti-Axis trend, it is a good idea. He also said that American warships can be used by the British or Canadian Navy. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### Lieutenant General Hoerner Speculates That the United States Will Soon Go to War

New Orleans - Lieutenant General Hoerner, leader of the US Reserve Officers Association, recently predicted that the United States will soon go to war, and said that the current situation is very serious. Hoerner also said that this is not just a European war, but a world revolution that may spread across the entire planet before peace is restored. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Washington - US Senator Norris (representing Nebraska) gave a speech yesterday advocating giving Britain more powerful assistance, believing that the United States should provide Britain with many warships. Now is a critical moment, and the United States should risk helping Britain. In any case, helping Britain today, even if there are sacrifices, will ultimately be less of a loss than the United States fighting Germany alone after Britain fails. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 25th)

### Japanese Businessmen Plan to Complete Southern Advance Plan Through Economic Means; Japan Seizes Goods in American Warehouses in Haiphong; Sends Aircraft to Demonstrate in the Sky

Tokyo - According to today's news, the Japan Department Store Association is considering a Japanese southern advance plan. This plan does not involve army and navy action, and does not require bloodshed. Japanese department stores are now planning to engage in advancement in Thailand and Vietnam. The method is either to conduct operations through a jointly invested company, or to distribute markets, with each market being handled by a Japanese department store. Also, in view of China's influence in Thailand and Vietnam, they will also consider wholesale trade methods. Currently, two of Japan's largest department stores are planning to send investigation teams to the South. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Saigon - The number of Japanese aircraft in Hanoi and Haiphong suddenly increased significantly today, and flew over Haiphong. American officials here explained that this action was a Japanese threat to prevent the French from protesting the Japanese seizure of all goods owned by Americans in the American warehouse in Haiphong on Sunday morning. The Japanese are showing off their force in order to make the French realize that it is useless to file a protest. At the same time, several Japanese merchant ships have sailed to Haiphong, ready to transport the goods owned by Americans that the Japanese seized from various American warehouses yesterday. American businessmen refused on Friday to hand over the keys to the warehouse to the Japanese. They handed the keys over to a French official in Haiphong, who protested the Japanese demand. But on Sunday morning, the Japanese seized the goods without notifying the Vietnamese government or American businessmen. These goods were originally prepared to be shipped to China, but at the time when the Japanese army entered Vietnam last year, American businessmen have been unable to ship the goods out since then. The Japanese claimed that these goods were owned by Chinese rather than Americans, and should be confiscated. The American Chamber of Commerce was ordered to hand over the keys at 9:00 a.m. on Sunday, but after the American businessmen refused their request, the Japanese seized the goods one hour before the deadline. The mayor of Haiphong immediately reported the situation to the Hanoi government. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### Increased US Mercury Production Hits Italy and Spain Hard; The Production of the Two Countries Previously Accounted for Four-Fifths of the World; Since Britain Bought from the United States, the Two Countries Have No Profit to Make

Washington - Officials from the Department of Commerce recently stated that the increase in mercury production in Mexico, Peru, and the United States has seriously hit the monopoly of Italy and Spain in the world mercury market. Experts from the Department of Commerce also cited official news, saying that they believe the high-speed production of Italy and Spain will end, because the mercury industry in Mexico has been reactivated due to the large demand from Britain in the war. The British government, fearing that it would not be able to obtain mercury from Spain during the war, decided to purchase completely from reliable Mexico. The current annual mercury production in Mexico is several thousand vats. At the same time, production in Peru and British Columbia has also increased for this reason. Last year, the US produced 50,000 vats of mercury. In addition to 20,000 vats used for domestic industry, most of the remaining was shipped to Britain. Commerce officials continued, saying that the surge in mercury production was entirely affected by the war, and that they believe the profits made by Italy and Spain in mercury have now been fatally hit. It is said that before the war, Italy and Spain produced four-fifths of the world's total mercury production. Officials also pointed out that various machines in the European war need a large amount of mercury. Now, the source of mercury needed by countries around the world has changed, so the situation in the world mercury market has also changed. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

### Fierce Fighting West of Canea, New Zealand Troops Fiercely Counterattack; No Changes in the Situation in Crete Yesterday; Germany Claims British Fleet Has Withdrawn

Crete - Sunday was quite calm. This situation does not mean that the Germans have lost their strongholds. However, the airport occupied by the Germans is limited to Maleme. It is generally believed that when the Germans are rushing to bomb Heraklion and Rethymno, they may bomb their own troops. German aircraft have also dropped supplies into the British army. It is now believed that the enemy's position in Maleme is under the bombardment of the British artillery. The German claim that they have expanded their occupied area is exaggerated. Some German troops may have landed by boat from the small islands of Greece. According to Middle East public reports, only German troops landed in Crete by air. The situation in Heraklion and Rethymno has not changed. After German air reinforcements arrived in the Maleme area, they launched a fierce attack on the British forces west of Canea under the cover of intensive bombing. Although the German army suffered heavy losses, the British army's position was invaded. New Zealand troops counterattacked, and fierce fighting is continuing. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Cairo - Canea has not been bombed for three hours, and there are signs that Germany lacks paratroopers. This is the latest news from Crete. The overall situation this afternoon does not seem to have changed much. According to the latest public report, New Zealand wounded soldiers fiercely counterattacked west of Canea. It is said that German troops invaded the British army's position there yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Cairo - A British official report stated that German reinforcements carried by aircraft continued to land in various parts of Crete on the 25th, but on a smaller scale than before. The British Air Force fiercely bombed the German positions on the island. British, Greek and Cretan troops counterattacked the concentrated German troops in Heraklion and Rethymno. The war is fierce. The main German position is in Maleme, between there and Canea, where hand-to-hand combat continued throughout the day. Both armies used dive bombers to bombard fiercely. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

London - A British official announced today that German aircraft returned to transport tanks to Crete, but denied that Germany had effectively controlled all of western Crete. British officials also said that there has been no news that these tanks have been put into battle. They also said that the British army on Crete has captured hundreds of German soldiers. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Rome - Italian officials announced that German troops transported by sea landed in large numbers on Crete on the 24th, and the fall of the island is imminent. The British report in Cairo also stated that a large German army transported by sea landed on Crete on the 25th. (United Press dispatch, 26th)

Berlin - The German military command officially stated that the German air force attacked the British fleet during the battle of Crete and achieved great success.

(Haishe dispatch, 26th)

Berlin - The first batch of German paratroopers to land on Crete encountered fierce attacks. They were surrounded and attacked by enemy forces, with very few numbers and heavy difficulties. Now, under the cover of German fighters, transport ships and troop carriers have landed reinforcements. The German army began to take the offensive, and the western half of the island has come under German control. The British fleet used in Crete was severely damaged by German aircraft attacks and has now withdrawn. British ships sunk include seven cruisers, eight destroyers, five torpedo boats, and one submarine. Many ships, large and small, were injured. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)

Berlin - The General Command has just released a battle report stating, "Our paratroopers, under the cover of fighter planes and destroyers, landed near the airfield in northern Crete and immediately occupied the British air base." (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Rare Intense Bombing of Crete's Three Key Cities by German Aircraft

Cairo - The fierce fighting between German and Allied forces continues in the Maleme area of Crete. Major General Heywood, head of the British military mission to Greece, returned from Crete last night. He stated, "I and the Allied forces can defend Crete. The evacuation of troops from Greece and the battle of Crete are part of a single operation. Considering the nature of the fighting in Crete and the difficulty of German forces landing reinforcements, I hope we have reached the final stage and can hold our ground. British Commonwealth troops and Royal Marines are engaged in extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat here." On Saturday afternoon, German aircraft carried out the most intense indiscriminate bombing of Crete since the start of the war. The damage was comparable to that of Rotterdam. German aircraft in waves dropped heavy bombs on the three key cities of the island, Canea, Rethymno, and Heraklion. The bombing was dense like raindrops and lasted for six hours with little respite. Heavy bombs hit the central areas of the three cities directly, forming straight lines of devastation. The commercial centers were completely destroyed, but the people remained as calm as those in London. Civilian casualties were minimal. Heraklion had already suffered heavy attacks on Thursday, and Rethymno on Friday. A British Air Force communiqué stated that British aircraft continued to launch heavy attacks on German positions and aircraft on Crete at the end of the week. On the 23rd, British heavy bombers raided Maleme airfield at night, destroying one large aircraft and causing a fire. The airfield had previously been attacked, with at least one German aircraft destroyed and several damaged. British fighter planes also attacked German troop transport aircraft in the Maleme area. In engagements between British aircraft and escorting German fighters, one British fighter plane was lost. (Reuter, 26th)

London - According to the latest official news from Cairo, hand-to-hand combat on Crete continues. The Germans are continuing to send troops to the island by air, but on a smaller scale than in previous days. The area between Rethymno and Canea is particularly fierce. The Germans in that area have suffered heavy losses. German aircraft on the ground continue to be heavily shelled by British artillery, causing significant damage. At the same time, British bombers and long-range fighters are stepping up operations, destroying several German aircraft in the Maleme area. Since two Axis convoys were defeated by the British Navy last week, there have been no reports of the Germans attempting to land troops and heavy equipment on Crete by sea. However, it is believed that some fishing boats may be sneaking ashore. According to opinions in London, there are German-held islands within sixty miles of Crete, making it extremely difficult for the British Navy to prevent small groups of enemy soldiers from landing in small boats. However, it is generally believed that the Allied forces have control of the situation on the island. (Reuter, 26th)

### Greek King Arrives in Egypt, Encouraging Military and Civilians to Uphold Their Traditional Spirit, and Jointly Defend the Nation with Brave Allied Forces

Cairo - It was officially announced that King George of Greece and the Greek government have left Crete for Egypt to avoid hindering military operations. After leaving the island, the King issued a proclamation to the military and civilians of Crete, encouraging them to uphold the traditional spirit of the Greek people's loyalty, courage, endurance, and sacrifice, to rally under the national flag, and to jointly defend the nation and strive for ultimate victory with brave Allied forces, and reaffirmed his belief in the final outcome. In this proclamation, the King explained his reasons for temporarily leaving Crete, stating that "One of the main objectives of the German paratroopers landing on Crete was the airfield near my residence and the Prime Minister's residence. The first wave of German paratroopers landed hundreds of yards from my residence and began fighting with the Allied forces. The enemy forces isolated us from our troops, and we had to withdraw to thwart the enemy's plan. After I went from my residence to the mountains, I consulted with those in charge and carefully studied the situation. To avoid hindering military plans, I decided to temporarily go to British territory at the invitation of the British government. This is the only way we can continue to perform our duties to benefit the nation." (Reuter, 26th)

Cairo - King George II of Greece broadcast a speech to the Greek people from here yesterday, saying that when German paratroopers landed on Crete, their first objective was to capture the Greek royal family. The first wave of paratroopers who landed on the island on May 20th were only a few hundred yards from the location of the King and the Greek Prime Minister and immediately engaged the Allied forces, and our communication with our troops was also cut off, making it necessary to relocate to prevent German conspiracies. It is reported that when the King escaped, he climbed over a mountain 7,000 feet high, pursued by German soldiers only 800 yards behind, and once hid in a mountain cave to avoid bombing by German aircraft overhead. Finally, he found a mule and, accompanied by two British officers, escaped to a coastal town. According to one of the two officers, Blackwood, speaking to a reporter from the United Press, many German paratroopers died when their parachutes failed to open during the jump. (United Press, 26th)

Quiet Night Throughout Britain

London - Last night, there were no reports of enemy aircraft dropping bombs anywhere in Britain. The only place enemy aircraft were spotted was on the northeast coast, but there were no incidents. There were no air raid warnings in London last night. This is the fifteenth consecutive night without bombing. At least two German fighter planes were shot down off the British coast last night. It is now reported that another Messerschmitt 110 German aircraft was shot down at sea by British fighter planes on Sunday.

### British Aircraft Pursue German Warships in the North Atlantic, Searching a Vast Area of Over a Thousand Miles, One Torpedo Hit

London - The Admiralty announced last night that British naval operations in the North Atlantic are still underway, aimed at forcing German warships into engagement. Since the battle on Saturday, after the British battlecruiser "Hood" exploded, German warships have been trying to evade pursuit by British ships. On that evening, British naval aircraft attacked and at least one torpedo hit a German warship. (Reuter, 26th)

London - Well-informed sources say that the British Navy is still employing the historical tactics of the Battle of Matapan, using naval aircraft to launch torpedoes at the fleeing German fleet to prevent the escape of the German battleship "Bismarck" and other German warships. British naval aircraft are determined to seek revenge, searching the sea over a vast area of over a thousand miles, but the dense fog covering a large area of the North Atlantic, coupled with the darkness of night, is facilitating the escape of German warships. Naval experts point out that, apart from the new battleships "King George V" and "Prince of Wales," only the "Hood" had the capability to confront the "Bismarck" and "Tirpitz." Ships such as the "Renown" and "Repulse," although fast enough to pursue, lacked the firepower and armor to match these elite German warships. (United Press, 26th)

Rome - The Italian News Agency reports that the German fleet that sank the "Hood" off the coast of Greenland also sank one British auxiliary cruiser and two to three other ships, totaling 16,000 tons. (United Press, 26th)

### Lin Yutang Lectures in New York on the Strength of the Chinese Nation, Shanghai Restaurant's Charity Dinner Donates Ambulance, Chinese Aid Association's Event Draws Celebrities, Lin Lists Ten Key Factors in China's Victory

Recently, overseas Chinese Feng Guoying and Zeng Lixian in New York opened a most modern restaurant, named "Shanghai Restaurant", in a newly built building opposite the Roxy Theatre. Out of a desire to serve the national cause, Feng and others contacted the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China and decided to donate all net income from the grand opening on April 22nd to the Bureau, in order to purchase a cargo-ambulance to send back to the motherland, for use in the war effort. The Bureau formed a special committee to handle this matter. After the meeting that night, Mrs. Xia Pingfang, wife of the President of the Bank of China, was elected to chair the program. Folksonson, editor of "Reader's Digest," was the banquet director, Dr. Xu Zhaodui, vice-chairman of the Chinese Aid Association, was the chairman of the conference, and Lin Yutang was the keynote speaker. Other attendees included writer Pearl Buck, Barnard College President Kidd Schlesinger, Song Ziang, Consul General Yu, Bank of China President Xia, New York Sun reporter Douglas, and writer Mina. One special feature of this dinner should be specifically mentioned: all guests, the chairman of the conference, and all staff paid for their meals, so that the income would be sufficient to purchase a vehicle.

Celebrities Attend, Unprecedented Success

At the opening of the meeting, Chairman Dr. Xu Zhaodui introduced celebrities Pearl Buck, Barnard College President Kidd Schlesinger, "Reader's Digest" editor Dr. Folksonson, and Consul General Yu. Chairman Xu said that since the war, the Chinese aid movement in the United States has relied heavily on the promotion of Consul General Yu. The establishment of the United Chinese Aid Association of America is also the result of Consul General Yu's efforts. Therefore, he gave a warm introduction to Consul General Yu. After Chairman Xu finished speaking, "Reader's Digest" editor Dr. Folkson presided over the meeting. Then Mr. Lin Yutang began his speech. Finally, Dr. Folksonson reported that the income from the dinner and the donations from the guests were sufficient to purchase a vehicle.

Mr. Lin Yutang's Speech is Insightful

The full text of Mr. Lin Yutang's speech is as follows: The most mysterious event in modern history is the current war between China and Japan. Although the Chinese people have suffered unimaginable pain, their great spirit remains the same, which is beyond the imagination of the world. At the beginning of the war, I said that this war was a war between long-range artillery and eternal philosophy, and the result would be a stalemate. Judging from the current situation, philosophy seems to be winning over artillery.

The Chinese National Character is Strong and Unyielding

In today's world, the Axis powers are brutal and tyrannical, believing that only force can achieve ultimate victory. However, democratic countries rely on the supreme spirit of fearlessness of mankind as the most effective weapon to overcome power. Frankly speaking, what we can hope for in the ultimate victory of Britain is the strong and unyielding character of the British people. As for the Chinese people, they are often considered not to possess this characteristic. However, the results of the war in China today are sufficient to show what a great national character of strength and unyieldingness can achieve. This can not only break past misunderstandings, but also be regarded as our greatest lesson. Although the Chinese people usually value courtesy, they are currently strong and unyielding.

Fighting While Building the Nation

China's final victory can now be asserted, but few people know the reasons for the current situation. Please allow me to explain. I believe that this war can achieve mysterious effects because it is fighting while building the nation. Recently, someone who visited Chongqing said that Chongqing is constantly building and improving, seemingly unaware of the possibility of air raids this summer, as if the war has ended. The entire country is busy with reconstruction. Last summer, I also saw people digging tunnels and building roads under air raids. Last winter, a new national library was completed, and a large theater that can accommodate thousands of people was added. As the saying goes, "If you don't advance, you retreat." If China had not advanced, developed the interior, and made it the base of operations, I am afraid that China would have been completely unable to resist. Therefore, building the nation is one of the tactics of warfare. Understanding this can help us understand why China's war strength is increasing day by day.

Factors of Victory, Ten Key Points

China's victory today is due to the unanimous support of the heroic leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek by the entire nation, and the continuous implementation of the original strategy. The factors are as follows: (1) The people of the whole country can be sincerely united and fight together. Not a single general has been tempted to surrender. (2) Millions of people would rather abandon their homes and flee to the interior, not complaining to the government due to hunger and cold. (3) All soldiers are brave. (4) Because the government and leaders are all diligent officials and serve the people, they have won their trust. Therefore, the people can endure the pain and wait for the final victory, and the soldiers can bravely fight without fear of death. (5) The development of the interior, the construction of roads, the relocation of factories and schools, etc., are all unavoidable facts, and all can be done one by one, which is quite difficult. (6) Not only has the original army not been scattered, but the new army being trained is increasing day by day. (7) In the guerrilla areas, the government has left a large number of guerrillas and regular national troops to carry out extremely effective sabotage work. (8) In the midst of vast destruction, a new era of Chinese construction has been created. (9) Thanks to God, all four years have been bountiful harvests. (10) The Yellow River has not frozen for three years, which has prevented the Japanese army from advancing, which is also very important.

Great Strength Defeats Weapons

In short, the realization of China's war strategy relies not only on the common vision of the leaders, but also on the great achievements of the people's ability to endure adversity and work hard. Take the world-famous Burma Road as an example. The completion of this road is considered by the world to be an artificial miracle. If the road could not have been completed by human effort, or had not been built in time, then China would have been in what situation? Fortunately, the road has been completed and opened to traffic two months after the fall of Wuhan, which proves the government's vision and the people's great strength in hard work. If objective historians, who must base everything on objective conditions, are to consider the matter, then China must have been predicted to fail. But China has succeeded, which shows that objective conditions (weapons) are sometimes no match for subjective fearlessness and perseverance. Now, Britain's equipment may be inferior to Germany's, but Britain has a spirit of fortitude and perseverance, so Britain will be able to achieve ultimate victory like China.

American Transport Ship "Hunter Liggett" Returns Home Yesterday, Carrying Over Three Hundred American Soldiers

The American naval transport ship "Hunter Liggett," carrying 224 American Marines whose service in Shanghai had expired, set sail from the mooring at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 26th) to return to the United States. The ship arrived in Shanghai last Friday (the 20th), carrying 150 replacement American soldiers. Although this number is less than half of the number of returning American soldiers, all sectors of the city are not paying much attention to it.

Dutch Ships Still Sail to the Far East, Not Discontinuing Service

According to a report yesterday by a Pingming News Agency reporter, it was learned from the shipping industry that the Dutch Royal Rotterdam Lloyd steamships that have temporarily suspended service are the "Tegelberg," "Boschfontein," and "Ruys." However, Dutch ships sailing on the Far East route will not be interrupted as a result. Other Dutch ships will join and continue to sail. It is also reported that the company's steamship "Le Maire" is scheduled to arrive today.

### American Reporter Stillwell: Impressions of a Trip Around the South China Sea: British, Dutch, and Australian Forces Have Established Strong Defenses; Chinese Morale is High and Cannot Be Threatened

American *Chicago Daily News* Far East correspondent Stillwell traveled to various places in the South Pacific and China at the beginning of this year. He first went from Shanghai to Hong Kong, via Singapore and the East Indies, then to Thailand. From Bangkok, he traveled overland to Rangoon, then via the Burma Road to Kunming and Chongqing. After four months, he recently returned from Chongqing to Hong Kong by plane, and from Hong Kong he took a boat back to Shanghai. Yesterday, he told reporters that although there is no formal alliance between the Dutch East Indies and Great Britain, the two sides have close cooperation. The people in various places in the South China Sea are deeply convinced that should the Dutch East Indies or British territories in the Pacific become involved in war, they will immediately provide each other with all possible assistance.

Surabaya Naval Forces Greatly Strengthened

Stillwell said that the defenses of Singapore and Malaya have doubled compared to a year ago, and the same is true in the Dutch East Indies. When the Netherlands fell, the local people were very discouraged, but now they are very excited. They also know that American planes often come to the Dutch East Indies because they have bases both at sea and on land. They are also now building "mosquito boats." The naval base near Surabaya has also been greatly strengthened recently. The local people feel they have an excellent military position to resist foreign aggression. The islands surrounding Java can serve as excellent barriers, and the population of each island is more sparse than that of Java. The Dutch and British there feel that the entire South China Sea area is closely related to each other and cannot be separated. The entire defense line extends from Singapore southward through the Dutch East Indies to Darwin Harbor in Australia. The Australian part is particularly important, as Australia is the British armory in the Far East. Aviation links in various areas of the South China Sea have also greatly improved. During the continuation of the war, the air route from the United States via Australia to the Dutch East Indies will become even more important.

Chongqing and Kunming Are Not Afraid of Air Raids

What Stillwell saw in Burma was the same as in other places: they are now actively setting up defenses. It is said that most of the new Burmese army are Indians. Kunming is very active. Although Japanese planes sometimes bomb the city, it has no impact on morale. Local residents are now changing their work hours, from 3:00 PM to midnight. They no longer work during the day. Everything in Chongqing is as usual. It is believed that Japanese air raids on Chongqing will definitely not resolve the war. As the effectiveness of air defense equipment continues to increase, bombing is also powerless. All the cars and movable property of the people can be moved, in part or in whole, to basements, so they will not be damaged by bombing.

Hong Kong Rice Should be Protected Against Smuggling

The Yuanshengxiang Rice Store at No. 56 Annam Road in the International Settlement purchased 25 bags of low-priced Hong Kong rice from the Tai Run Grain Store for sale. Unexpectedly, last Saturday (the 24th) at 2:00 PM, a detective discovered that the low-priced Hong Kong rice sold by the store was slightly different. According to information reported to the Shanghai Municipal Council, a special detective, Yang Shiquan, was dispatched to the store yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to investigate. According to a Mr. Li in the store, there was no adulteration, but the quality was slightly inferior. The detective took a small sample of rice from each of the ten or so bags of rice in the store and brought them back to the police station for detailed investigation before taking further action.

Collecting Low-Quality Rice to Smuggle Out of the Country

Recently, a certain firm has been specializing in collecting 30,000 bags of low-quality rice from the "De**" ship about to arrive at the port, attempting to transport them to Fujian and Macau. Some people even mixed No. 1 and No. 2 broken rice to impersonate No. 4 rice grits, obtaining removal permits from the authorities and transporting them to Wuxi and Hangzhou to seek huge profits. This is extremely illegal. It is hoped that the authorities of the two settlements will pay close attention to this.

Negotiations Still Underway for the Wholesale Price of Rice

According to rice industry sources, the French Municipal Council's tribute rice is being shipped to Shanghai for sale. Grain stores are now sending representatives to negotiate with the Council on the issue of sales profits. According to rice industry insiders, the current wholesale price of low-priced Hong Kong rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement to grain stores is 122.91 yuan per bag, and the selling price to rice stores is 133.50 yuan, resulting in a profit of 8.5%. Now, the French Municipal Council is only willing to give a profit of 8%, which is actually less than that of the International Settlement, so the two sides have not yet reached an agreement.

The Root Cause of Rising Pork Prices

The source of pigs in this port is extremely scarce recently due to government controls, and the prices in the producing areas are high, with overlapping transportation costs and miscellaneous taxes, resulting in soaring fresh meat prices, reaching three yuan per catty, still without supply to meet demand. The market is privately distributed by brokers, disregarding the capital of vendors and arbitrarily lowering prices for sale and raising prices, taking profits from it. It is difficult for meat prices to rise, and pig vendors still need to use long sticks, with many going to other ports to do business. Before the war, the meat industry usually purchased live pigs from pig farms and sent them to slaughterhouses for slaughter, then sold white meat. However, now everything is manipulated. Many so-called brokers are disguised meat merchants, supplying the goods they receive to their own stores for sale. There are also those who are nominally pig farms, but actually do not sell live pigs to meat merchants, but slaughter the pigs themselves and retail the white meat to meat merchants (what meat vendors commonly call "hanging meat"). Therefore, small meat merchants cannot purchase live pigs for slaughter themselves. After layers of exploitation, meat prices have soared, creating a meat shortage phenomenon.

### Jinan Steamer Encountered Gale and Accidentally Steered Off Course and Hit a Reef; Fortunately, the Forecastle Was Lodged on the Reef Tip and Did Not Sink; Passengers Were Transferred Back to Shanghai by the Suzhou Steamer

The Jinan, a regular ship on the South China Line of the British Taikoo Shipping Company, with a deadweight of over 2,100 tons, loaded passengers and cargo in Shanghai at 11:00 AM last Friday (the 23rd) and set sail directly for Hong Kong. At about 9:00 PM that night, it sailed near the Zhoushan Islands. At that time, there was a thunderstorm and wind and waves, and the driver lost control and accidentally steered off course, hitting a hidden reef.

The Forecastle Was Punctured

Sea water poured in, but fortunately the forecastle was lodged on the reef tip, and there was no danger of sinking, but the ship could not move. The ship sent a telegram for help immediately after the accident. The company received the telegram and hired two large tugboats from Moller & Codrington the next morning (the 24th), dispatching more than 30 workers to prepare to unload the cargo from the Jinan. On the one hand, the company telegraphed the Suzhou ship, which was on its way from Hong Kong to Shanghai, to go to the scene of the accident and pick up the passengers of the Jinan. The Suzhou ship arrived in port at about 4:00 PM yesterday, and all of the more than 110 passengers of the Jinan ship were

Safely Returned to Shanghai

According to the passengers of the Jinan, they were terrified when the Jinan ship had the accident, but after learning that the ship would not sink on the reef, they were all relieved. Currently, the bow of the ship is raised high, and the two large tugboats dispatched by the company are unloading the cargo, waiting for the ship to float up after the cargo is unloaded, and then drag it out of danger. The sea water in the cabin will also be pumped out, and the punctured area will be repaired. It will still need to return to Shanghai for repairs. It is said that the passengers and crew of the ship were safe and sound, and there was no loss of luggage or items. However, some of the vegetables and foreign potatoes loaded in the forecastle were thrown into the sea in order to lighten the ship's body to make it float. According to the company, the passengers of the Jinan ship returning to Shanghai can exchange their tickets for passage on other ships, or they can return their tickets for a refund.

Rotary Club Regular Meeting This Week

The regular meeting of the Shanghai Rotary Club this week is scheduled for noon on Thursday, May 29th, at the Doughty Hotel. At that time, Bishop Ward of the Central China Church will give a lecture on "Memoirs of a Member's Excursion." This topic is very interesting for members traveling in the interior, as he himself has accumulated rich experience from traveling in the interior for four years. All members from this city and other places who wish to invite guests to attend are requested to call the Club Secretary (16450) to reserve seats.

The Iron Gates of the French Concession Were Still Closed Yesterday; Someone Climbed Over the Wall to Enter the Nanshi; The Policeman Opened Fire, Fortunately Not Hitting Anyone

The iron gates connecting the French Concession and the Nanshi were closed after Kikuji Kabashima, the captain of the Japanese Gendarmerie, was shot in the Old Warehouse Street of Nanshi on the 24th. They have not been opened until yesterday. The residents who were blocked were standing inside and outside the iron gates, looking very hesitant. According to a *Datong News Agency* reporter who visited the iron gates yesterday morning, there was no trace of anyone on the Minquan Road of Nanshi, and the scene was desolate. Some Nanshi residents waiting outside the iron gates were especially pitiful because of the sudden cold weather.

The Policeman Opened Fire and Was Reprimanded on the Spot

According to a *Datong News Agency* reporter, at 1:00 PM on the previous day (the 24th), at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Caishi Road, Kunming and the Chinese boundary, due to the traffic blockade, some Nanshi residents in the concession could not pass, so they climbed over the low wall in the hope of entering. A policeman standing there suddenly fired a shot at the residents climbing over the low wall, fortunately not hitting anyone. Another French policeman came forward, took the bullets from the policeman's gun, and reprimanded him for his reckless shooting.

### Stock Broker Liu Jianwu Was Kidnapped and Escaped; Three Arrested Criminals Were All Western-Suited Youths; They Confessed That the Idea Was Conceived by a Man Named Ni Guozhang

Liu Jianwu, a Hunanese who works as a stock broker, usually drives his own car, No. 1317. At 11:50 PM on the 24th of this month, Liu was on his way home from a friend's place in the Xiudexincun on Chengdu Road, and as he was about to start the car, he was suddenly threatened by three kidnappers with guns. Liu was tied up and put into a hired car, No. 12119, from the Tailai Motor Company, and driven to Room 10 in Apartment No. 24, Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, to be guarded. A letter was sent to his family, intending to

Extort a Huge Sum of Money

Unexpectedly, at 1:00 PM the next day, the 25th, the kidnappers guarding him were all taking a nap. In a moment, loud snores were heard. Liu took the opportunity to escape and ran to the alley entrance, reporting to Chinese policeman No. 645, who in turn reported to several Chinese policemen stationed in front of the Bank of Communications nearby, who rushed to surround the place. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and Chief Western Detective Kaoxindeng, Deputy Chief Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanjing, Detective Yang Fusheng, and Detective Yan Bingheng were specially dispatched to rush into Room 10 of No. 24, but it was already empty.

### Sir Lytton Believes Deeply That China Will Never Be Conquered

The *China Press* published an article yesterday by Sir Lytton of England, which stated: In March of this year, President Roosevelt stated in his worldwide radio broadcast that China and the United Kingdom should both be beneficiaries of the American Lend-Lease Act and enjoy the assistance that the United States can provide to carry out their heroic war against Japan. We must know that China has been engaged in continuous warfare for nearly ten years. During this period, it has never received foreign aid, but has been able to fight independently. Its purpose of fighting is no different from our purpose of being forced to defend equality, freedom, and justice with arms seven years later.

China Will Never Be Conquered

China has witnessed its country being invaded, its people being massacred, and its cities being bombed, without the means of defense or retaliation. Suppose that the young pilots of our (British) Royal Air Force, despite their talents and experience, had no machines to resist German bombers, and suppose that we had no sufficient anti-aircraft guns to resist enemy air raids, what would be our misfortune? However, China's experience is indeed the same. Although its equipment is poor, its fighting spirit has remained the same for several years, and its courage in battle has increased unabated. Today, China is more unconquerable than at the beginning of the war.

Deeply Regret Not Providing Assistance Back Then

If we had been able to provide China with assistance in 1932, we would not have witnessed the rise of Hitlerism in Germany; nor would we have witnessed the war spreading to Africa and Europe. China has always encouraged itself with patience and never complained. China knows our difficulties and weaknesses, so it is satisfied with only our empty sympathy. But the current situation is very different. We have promised material assistance and guaranteed that it will be delivered, and China is fighting with this new hope. We must know that Britain is now fighting for freedom and for upholding world justice, but this war for freedom and justice began as early as 1931 when the Japanese army invaded Shenyang.

Others Followed Suit, Leaving Trouble for Today

The only benefit of the European War from 1914 to 1918, which sacrificed countless lives, was to establish a worldwide organization to prevent the recurrence of aggression. This is a lifeline of civilization, also the "new order" exchanged for the blood of millions of people. Japan was originally one of the strong countries and an important trustee of the "new order." Unexpectedly, it willingly became the leader of the rebels and first destroyed this "new order." As a result, other countries had an example to follow and followed suit, creating the chaotic situation in the world today. If we want to build a true "new order" in the future, we must not forget who first destroyed the order and who first maintained the order?

Who First Initiated the Act of Aggression

In fact, every action and method taken by Germany and Italy in Europe today was first initiated by Japan in Asia. Launching troops without a declaration of war, yet calling it peace, preparing for hostility while ostensibly being friendly, inciting disturbances in neighboring countries to create an excuse for armed intervention, while calling it restoring order, occupying the territories of others and claiming to have no territorial ambitions—in all of these things, Japan can be called the earliest inventor.

Will Surely Tread the Path of Napoleon

After the war, its spirit has not been deterred. Although China has suffered great sacrifices, the unity of its people is unprecedented in its history. Japan has created Chinese nationalism, just as Napoleon created European nationalism. Napoleon was destroyed by the European nationalism he created, so those who deal with Japan must also deal with Chinese nationalism. The war in the Far East was the starting point for the war in Europe today, so to end the European war, we must first resolve the conflict in the Far East in a fair and permanent way.

The Arrival of Light Is Not Far Away

The Japanese have studied the situation in Europe and the United States extensively. When other countries in the world were only busy with economic and political crises and had no time to look to the East, Japan took the opportunity to take aggressive actions against China, so that other countries could not intervene. But the Chinese people deeply believe that China will never be conquered by Japan. On the contrary, Japan is very worried about the development of the United States and Japan. When the war for freedom in Europe is won, it will be the day of reckoning in Asia. The grievances suffered by Abyssinia have been redressed, and the day of China's revenge is not far away.

### Letter from the British Tramway Company: Stating the Cause of the Tram Fire; Proving that Passengers Carried Explosives Caused the Disaster; The Company Expresses Deep Sympathy for the Deceased and Injured

A letter from the British Tramway Company of the International Settlement stated: Sir, regarding the fire on a trolleybus on May 19, there are many rumors in the outside world. The truth is hereby announced as follows: The bus was traveling south on Carter Road, and when it passed Shanhaiguan Road, the third-class carriage suddenly exploded. The cause is unknown, leading to a fire that quickly spread to the first-class carriage. However, the burning time was very short, estimated to be no more than three or four minutes, before it was extinguished. The passengers were in chaos, and the employees on the bus tried to maintain order but failed. Two employees were slightly injured, and some passengers were also burned, including some who died in the hospital due to serious injuries. After the incident, the company immediately handed the bus over to the Shanghai Municipal Council for inspection, which confirmed that the explosion and fire were not caused by any electrical current or other faulty equipment on the bus, and had absolutely no relationship with the engine parts of the bus. The investigation is currently underway. Judging from various signs, someone brought explosives or flammable materials into the bus at the time, causing this disaster. The identity of the person who brought this item is still unknown. The company is deeply saddened by this incident and expresses its deep sympathy to the families of the deceased and the injured. Sincerely, Shanghai Electric Tramways Limited, May 26.

Strange Guests Suddenly Came to the Home of the Court's Dispatch Director; Instructed Him to Go to a Certain Place; The Couple Took the Opportunity to Slip Away

A Trolleybus Ran Over and Killed Someone; Tried to Avoid It but Was Too Late; Crashed into a Coffin Shop

Trolleybus No. 327 of the British Company, Route 17, travels between the Sichuan Road Bridge and the Dapu Bridge in the French Concession.

Xu was unable to brake in time and knocked Song down in the middle of the road, causing him to be injured and die. Because he wanted to avoid it, the trolleybus crashed the front of the car into a coffin shop set up by Wang Da at No. 728 on the north side, and the doors, windows, and coffins were damaged. The nearby Lujiabang Police Station heard the news and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to take care of the scene, and investigated the facts to report for verification.

### Bomb Explosion Case: Three People Died; A Woman Brought Back an Iron Can; Cohabiting to Watch Caused the Disaster; The Mother and Daughter of the Tenant Did Not Return

The general situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned from the police station that Yu has a daughter, Lu Suzhen, 15 years old, who brought back an iron can from outside on the morning before yesterday. It is said that a relative gave her candy, so she brought it back and placed it on the table. When Yu and her daughter went out to eat supper at a relative's place in the evening, someone living in the same room suddenly became curious and opened the iron can to look at it, causing it to explode. Until now, Yu and her daughter have not returned home, so the origin of this bomb is still unknown. It is now known that the women who were injured on the spot, Lin Shao, 33 years old, the girl, Shao Abao, 12 years old, and Zhang Chen, 47 years old, were all from Ningbo. All three died from their injuries before they could be treated. Their bodies were transported to the Tongren Fuyuantang morgue for autopsy, and then their families came to the scene to collect them. Yesterday, two buses in the International Settlement and the French Concession were robbed. Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, a bus on Route 1 was carrying passengers and traveling near Jing'an Temple Road and Hartung Road.

Economic Commentary: Feng Liu

### Banks (4)

At that time, the Ministry of Revenue requested the establishment of a bank on February 13th (Guangxu 30th year), with a capital of four million taels of gold. The Ministry of Revenue was responsible for raising half of the funds, and the remaining two million taels were to be raised from merchants in the form of shares, with a monthly interest rate of six percent (i.e., as the capital for establishing the Ministry of Revenue Bank). However, due to the issuance of banknotes during the Xianfeng era and the holding of Zhaoxin shares during the Guangxu 25th year, the government failed to gain the trust of the people. Merchants became increasingly suspicious, and upon hearing that it was government-run, they frowned and regarded it as a dangerous path. Therefore, Jiang Shiheng's father said, "Why not order Prince Qing to withdraw the funds from HSBC and allocate them to the government-run bank as shares, so that the capital can be easily raised and the bank can be quickly established? And increase the monthly interest rate from two percent to six percent, which would greatly benefit Prince Qing's private property, and merchants would dispel their suspicions and actively join in."

The memorial was accepted, and Lu Chuanlin was sent to HSBC to investigate thoroughly. The bank's general manager, Hee Lear, and compradore, Yang Shaowo, refused the investigation, claiming that "the bank's regulations prohibit informing anyone about customer deposits, and account statements are also not allowed to be shown to anyone." Therefore, the investigation yielded no results. As a result, Jiang Shiheng was punished and removed from his position as censor, and transferred to his original yamen.

This shows that many officials hid their wealth in foreign banks. Therefore, even if Empress Dowager Cixi had not done this, it is possible that members of the royal family and nobles had done so. Moreover, at that time, various foreign banks established branches in Beijing, and their only business was to absorb the private savings of officials as interest-free deposits, and then lend them to the Qing government to expand their influence in China. The Russo-Chinese Bank was looted during the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year (1900 AD). The rebels envied HSBC's large amount of silver and attempted to rob it, but failed. At the time, people wrote poems about this event, saying:

"The Russo-Chinese Bank went west, HSBC stored its wealth. Millions of taels of snow-white silver were hoarded. They wanted to make a fortune from foreigners like ants, Chongwen's gate connected directly to Zheng Yang's gate."

Since the Banque de France merged with the Russo-Chinese Bank, France no longer had a bank in China. Moreover, at that time, the Qing government's military expenditures and reparations were huge, and there was no way to increase revenue. They often used road and mine industries to borrow money from foreign merchants. The amount of loans guaranteed was huge, the benefits were high, the conditions were harsh, and the commissions were generous, unparalleled in the world. France could not remain unmoved. Therefore, they endowed the Banque de l'Indochine, which they jointly operated in the Annam colony, with special privileges, established a branch in Shanghai. It was established in the Guangxu 14th year (1898 AD, the bank's head office was established in Paris in 1875 AD), with a capital of one million taels of silver, and opened a branch in Shanghai, which is the Banque de l'Indochine. Soon, it was making profits, and branches were established throughout the north and south. It was first located on the west side of Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road, then moved to the Bund of the French Concession, the current site of the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, and then moved to its current site, the former site of the Banque de France.

### Food: Plans to Export Shanghai Rice, Rice Weevils and Speculators are Elated. Fortunately, the Sale of Rice by the Two Concessions Never Stops

Yesterday, speculators were active in the foreign rice market, and the market suddenly showed a prosperous and thriving atmosphere. Both futures and spot goods rose in unison. Speculators and manipulators are also trying to make a comeback, taking advantage of the recent domestic sales of foreign rice to Ningbo and Shaoxing, and the expanded official reports of Japanese merchants transporting rice. The "leather ball gang" and "hat gang" are even more active in secret. Therefore, after the opening prices in the early market, various high-grade foreign rice and Yinghua Company's futures all rose in unison. As a result, all rose by 13 yuan compared to last Saturday. Although it was prohibited in the afternoon, people's sentiments were still excited. However, Hong Kong rice is arriving in Shanghai continuously. In addition to the third batch having arrived in Shanghai and awaiting sale, the fourth and fifth batches have also been arranged to be shipped. Moreover, the French Municipal Council's sale of Vietnamese rice also has 50,000 bags already arrived in Shanghai, which will be sold on the 1st. Its selling price and all procedures will be handled publicly in accordance with the precedents of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. Its merits of benefiting citizens and stabilizing the rice market are very great. Although speculators and manipulators are trying to be active, it is feared that they may not be able to sell their manipulation. Transactions were particularly focused on Xiaowen and Mindang rice. The actual sales on the street were also strong for medium-grade goods such as No. 2 Saigon and Siam rice. New speculators and general retail investors made waves from the middle. Prices rose all the way. No. 1 Saigon opened at 119 yuan to 120 yuan, No. 2 reached 115 yuan, No. 2 Siam 112 yuan, Xiaowen 114 yuan, Mindang rice jumped from 114 yuan to 118 yuan, Shenjing round white rice 109 yuan, secondary 104.5 yuan, broken rice 91.2 yuan. Overall, although the above prices are all higher than the week before, there are many differences, ranging from 12 yuan to 34 yuan. This is because the destinations of each type of goods are different, resulting in some differences. Yinghua Company Xiaowen 1367 yuan, No. 1 Saigon 143.5 yuan to 144.5 yuan, broken rice 103 yuan to 105 yuan. The total volume of spot rice traded throughout the day was 25,600 bags, and Yinghua Company traded 1,5600 tons.

The national rice such as Thick, Thin and Japonica rice, because of the temporary market shutdown, the arrival of goods was slightly thick. Although yesterday, the local rice went well. However, the goods owners found it difficult to sell. As a result, the market for both thick and thin Japonica rice was similar to the week before. The opening price of Wuxi fresh japonica was 134 yuan, Kunshan fresh japonica 132 yuan, secondary to 128 yuan, Nangang early and late rice fresh 132 yuan, 120 yuan, special 134 yuan. Secondary stored was short and there was no market, original package white 135 yuan to 132 yuan.

Glutinous rice is in season for the Dragon Boat Festival, and the destination is more prosperous. However, the goods rushing to the market for the festival are also not weak. This results in a balance between supply and demand, and there is a lack of changes in the market. Hong Kong white glutinous rice still opened at 112 yuan, and the secondary grade was 1089 yuan, national glutinous rice special original package sold at 124 yuan.

Speculators colluding with rice weevils are still manipulating the market and hoarding goods for profit. The Municipal Council is purchasing Burmese rice, which is being transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai in a continuous stream. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang and Nanning ships arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (25th), each carrying 10,000 bags. The Suzhou ship arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying 10,000 bags from Hong Kong. The Jiangsu ship only carried 5,700 bags, and unloading began yesterday. The first batch of tribute rice purchased by the French Municipal Council has also arrived in Shanghai, loaded on the Compagnie Maritime des Chargeurs Réunis' Général Joffre ship, which arrived at the port the day before yesterday (25th) morning. The ship directly loaded 3,600 tons from Saigon, about 17,000 bags. It is said that part of it is still for passengers.

Bean Cakes Frequently Appear

Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains, oil cakes, and flour remained in a fluctuating trend. Although the current stock of soybean oil is controlled by the adjusting company, the sales market is sluggish and it is difficult to recover. Soybeans and corn have slightly increased, but bean cakes are frequently released due to unfavorable overall conditions, and sales have been declining. Although there has been some struggle in the middle, the downward trend has become established. As a result, it has fallen by 67 jiao compared to the end of last week. Statistics show that 50 pieces of Dalian soybean oil were opened, and the price is detailed in the market price column, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 1,500 bags of Guide soybeans, 200 bags of Jiaozhou beans, 400 bags of Tianjin beans, 140 bags of green beans, a total of 2,000 bags of spot and forward corn were traded, and 50,000 pieces of Shenji cakes were traded. On the 27th, 1,500 bags of corn will be shipped to Yantai.

Securities: Increased Number of Public Debt Buyers

The public debt black market trended slightly stronger yesterday. Tiansheng continued to buy, and Yuxing and Xinhua also bought, and the trend is gradually bullish. However, the pace will inevitably be slow. Yesterday morning, Tiansheng and Yuxing bought very actively. Cunyi and Jiufeng also showed interest. The sellers were Hongda, Lianhe, Datong, Tongkang, etc., who also sold some. The noon closing was relatively firm. There were more transactions in the afternoon. Grade A rose straight to 6 yuan in the buying by Xinhua and Lianyi. Tiansheng and Yuxing's interest remained strong, and Ruiyu also had demand. The suppliers were mostly scattered lots and short positions from Tongshun, Hengfu, Xinfu, Yizhong, Renchang, etc. However, all items were slightly firmer. The market price ultimately rebounded by 12 jiao to 5.5 jiao, with Grade A rising the most. The total trading volume was approximately 1.3 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock trading: 50 shares of the new New Company were traded at a price of 19.5 yuan.

The public stock market was soft in the quiet. The prices on that day hardly changed.

Yarn and Cloth: Japanese Yarn Prices Plummeted, Shuangma Arbitrage Sold Fusheng, Sales in Hong Kong Seemed to Turn Slightly, The Market Tried to Rise but Fell Instead

The yarn market is still hovering slightly, but the situation is very frustrating, so the upward momentum is particularly weak. However, Hong Kong merchants have stopped purchasing for a long time and are quite eager to move. Therefore, 900 packages of 10, 22, and 10 count yarns were purchased today, which lifted the stagnant and discouraged morale one step. Therefore, the market situation is soft with a hint of bullishness. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,425 yuan, and the low price was 1,415 yuan. The market continued to be stable after opening in the afternoon. Because the noon closing was good and Guang merchants had some transactions, the morale was stable. The initial trade was 1,424 yuan. Then, major players came to sell short, and it fell to 1,417 yuan, hovering between 15 and 16 yuan for a long time. After 3 o'clock, it was heard that the yarn and cloth market price of the exchange plummeted, and the popularity suddenly loosened, and a part of them suddenly came to sell arbitrage, and suddenly fell to 1,407 yuan. Later, the people who covered their positions were active, and they recovered to 1,412 yuan. As a result, with the foreign exchange tending to loosen by 0.3125, the closing price was 1,4056 yuan.

Shuangma opened tired yesterday. The first price was 1,419 yuan to 20 yuan. However, profits were covered, and the table was tightened. After a short time, it rose to 1,425 yuan. Then, it was heard that the foreign exchange did not move and the margin was mediocre. The market situation was weak again and fell to 1,418 yuan. Halfway through, Guang merchants had spot yarn transactions of 7800 packages, and the stagnant morale was revived. The situation returned to 1,424 yuan at the close. However, the transactions on the table were not as strong as the previous day. It was found that the statistics for half a day's transactions were 9,900 packages, of which 900 packages were handled by Hong Kong merchants, and the trading of the leather ball gang by the same industry and outside the industry accounted for 9,000 packages.

The Cotton Market Was Mediocre

The current cotton situation has become mediocre again. Because the yarn market is weak, the cotton market, which depends on it, is also affected. Although there are some movements between the numbers, the actual needs of the factory are not strong, and there is still a lack of favorable impact from all parties, so the transactions are still few. Yesterday, a total of 1,059 pieces were traded at a relatively stable price.

Piece Goods: East Cloth Plunged Wildly, Factory Cloth Sale Offers Vary

The trend of the factory cloth market continued to soften yesterday, because the end of the month is approaching, and all parties are waiting and watching. Due to the relationship between the quantity of goods, the sales offers varied. White goods, coarse cloth, and coarse twill were as firm as ever, while fine cloth and fine twill continued to decline, with each piece down by 2.5 to 5 jiao. A portion of bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 5 jiao. More than 400 pieces of various cloths were traded on the street. Guangdong and Hong Kong and Nanyang merchants purchased more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill, colored twill, and blue cloth. 16-pound Feihong coarse twill Hong Kong sold 13 yuan, and the legal gang sold more than 58 yuan, and there were continued purchases. On the 27th, 125 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai.

The trend of falling in East cloth is fierce again. The longtou fine cloth futures in the exchange are falling in each session, with each piece falling sharply by about 2 yuan, resulting in a consistent fall in the spot market. The back street factory stack sold opened at 44.35 yuan, a drop of 1.8 yuan compared to the previous week. The four gentlemen tweed in color was 1.41375 yuan at noon, and the evening closing also fell to 1.385 yuan, a drop of 3.5 minutes, which is relatively firm.

The Woolen Market Turned Dull

The woolen market took a dull turn yesterday. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants had already stopped purchasing. The street door shop gang reduced the need due to the heat and less actual sales. The Western clothing gang is preparing to collect relief items for the Dragon Boat Festival, and most of them are based on the principle of selling as they go. Sales of summer goods are sluggish, while sellers of autumn and winter wool are hoarding goods due to the tense atmosphere, shouting out prices, so although there is a need, the mood is not as strong as it was ten days ago.

Silk and Tea: Silk Exports Are Still Not Smooth

Yesterday, New York was closed due to the holiday. Yokohama's telegraphic message stated that silk prices rose slightly by 5 yuan, and futures rose by 7 yuan. Foreign silk sales are still not smooth. Yesterday, foreign firms only traded 5 packages, and the price was still stable. Sales of silk for end use have also stopped, so the market atmosphere is very quiet and tired.

Sugar Market: Dutch Raw Sugar Continued to Fall by 3 Yuan, The Coarse White Market Also Softened

There was not much difference in the sugar market yesterday, but it still did not get rid of the soft image. The guild divided the market. The current spot two or four coarse white sugar arriving in February was 103 yuan. The late May futures were initially 104.2 jiao, then rose to 4.4 jiao. They still returned to 4 jiao, 4.2 jiao. June 10th futures in the morning were 105.5 jiao, 5.05 minutes, 5.25 jiao, and in the afternoon 105.1 jiao, then loosened to 4.9 jiao, 8 jiao, slightly less than the previous day's triangle. Dutch raw sugar spot was 81 yuan, slightly less than (17th) 3 yuan. Also, yesterday, 8,220 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong.

Seafood: Western Sea Cucumbers Opened Firmly

Recently, Western sea cucumbers have arrived slightly. A batch has been opened, the number is not large, and the market is stable. For example, jade sea cucumber selected strips were 477 yuan, and the export office was 468 yuan, No. 1 was 436 yuan, No. 2 was 411 yuan, and No. 3 was 366 yuan. Red sea cucumber No. 1 was 245 yuan, No. 2 was 109 yuan, No. 3 was 163 yuan, the call number was 136 yuan, black circle sea cucumber large was 421 yuan, medium was 369 yuan to 334 yuan, small was 218 yuan, square sea cucumber large was 456 yuan, medium was 369 yuan, small was 268 yuan, plum strip sea cucumber export office was 194 yuan, No. 1 was 183 yuan, No. 2 was 152 yuan, round black sea cucumber large was 180 yuan, medium was 171 yuan, No. 1 small was 154 yuan, gray rock sea cucumber large was 391 yuan, medium was 339 yuan, small was 259 yuan, black rock sea cucumber large was 344 yuan, medium was 294 yuan, small was 245 yuan, peeled sea cucumber was 127 yuan to 117 yuan, bare sea cucumber such as the top bare was 879 yuan, the top big bare was 777 yuan, the big bare was 628 yuan, the medium bare was 566 yuan, the small medium bare was 151 yuan, and the small bare was 312 yuan.

Medicinal Materials: Although Spring Flowers Rose, They Were Still Losing Money

Spring flowers were recently transported from the Yangtze River in dozens of pieces. The external costs were relatively high, and the cost was not light. Yesterday, it was heard that the asking price was 40% better than the old price, but according to the cost, it was still necessary to lose several yuan.

### Chen Feihong Invents Index Board

(Fujian Shaxian Correspondence) Mr. Chen Feihong, an expert in library science and the current director of the Fujian Provincial Library, has recently invented an index board (English name: Index Board). It can be used in library catalog rooms, file storage rooms, bank depositor registration offices, and other institutions that use loose-leaf catalogs or card catalogs. It is more convenient, economical, durable, beautiful, and easier to search. There are rotating rack types, tabletop types, and wall-mounted types. The number of panels per rack is not fixed. Each panel uses 110 wooden strips, including 100 black strips, 8 blue strips, and 2 yellow strips. Yellow and blue strips indicate categories, and black strips indicate book titles, case names, or account names, etc. For usage, special white oil is used to write on the wooden strips, and the arrangement and usage are the same as card catalogs. Its feature is that if you want to change the written words, you can use special degreasing water to erase them. Currently, all libraries in Fujian Province have adopted it. It is said that a large number of local wood and famous lacquer work are used for manufacturing, which is cheaper than paper.

### Essentials of Guidance for Further Education and Employment (1) Shen Guanglie

Guidance for further education and employment, in a broader sense, is educational guidance and vocational guidance. In addition to the issue of further education, the most prominent aspects of educational guidance, such as aptitude tests and interest surveys, are very important tasks. Vocational guidance, in the simplest terms, is to help individuals choose a career, prepare for a career, obtain a career, and improve a career. The employment problem is only one part of it. From the analysis and induction of both aspects, both belong to the field of vocational education. Education and career development are linked to meet the needs of society and have practical value. Career development adopts educational methods to have a scientific basis and achieve normal development. How to make the education and career circles communicate and work together is a problem worth paying attention to.

According to the daily work experience of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, the employment of career development has a gradual improvement trend, and does not completely adopt the previous inherited system. Recently, in addition to paying attention to talent assessment, many places are implementing vocational training, service ethics, knowledge and skills cultivation, etc. for staff, which is of course a gratifying phenomenon. Schools also pay attention to cultivating young people and provide practical guidance for students' future. Recently, before the winter and summer vacations, schools often have guidance for further education and employment, which is a very obvious example. The training problem in the current career development will not be discussed for the time being. First, we will make a brief exploration of the current facilities for guidance on further education and employment in various schools. Before explaining this work, there should be several basic understandings:

(1) Guidance for further education and employment is a long-term work. At present, various schools conduct tests for graduates before the holidays, invite people to give speeches, provide individual guidance, and conduct internships and visits, which are of course very good methods. However, limiting it to this, working once or twice a year, is really not enough. There should be a whole plan not only in peacetime, but also continued guidance and maintenance of considerable contact after graduation. It is by no means a short-term, temporary, routine work.

### Chicken

—Wei Gan

For the past thirty years, I have lived a city life, especially in the lane houses of Shanghai, looking up at a sky that is only a few feet wide, and unable to step on even an inch of soil under my feet. The only small patio in front of the house is paved with cement, and not a single blade of grass can grow. Every day I breathe in coal smoke, without a trace of fresh air. Although the green grass is green every year and the flowers bloom in various ways, we have not seen them come and go in spring. Not for any title or career, I have abandoned so many years of good spring, and I feel a little wronged when I think about it. However, if you go to live in the countryside, no one will give you food. Life is still the first priority, and the pursuit of fame and wealth must be based on life as a prerequisite. You must first solve the problem of eating before you can talk about advancement and enjoyment. We live in the city, in the business district, and those who do not know always think that we are either seeking fame or profit, or doing something that seeks both fame and profit, but that is not the case. It is very pathetic to say that we are just urban parasites, relying on living in the city to make a living. Leaving the city, although there are birds singing and flowers fragrant, clear breeze and bright moon, you can pillow on springs and rinse your mouth with stones, you can sit on the moon and get drunk with flowers, you can listen to the songs of water chestnut pickers, and you can watch the farmers planting, but we writers who shake our pens are only spectators of the pastoral, not producers. Returning to the countryside requires many years of being a high official in the capital, with considerable savings before it is possible. Now that I have neither achieved fame nor wealth, how can I leave the city? For the sake of making a living and supporting my family, the result is that I have been eating in the city year after year, wasting many good days in spring and autumn, and not knowing that old age is coming.

When I was a child, I also lived in the countryside, with rice fields outside the door, green mountains and white clouds, morning glow and evening haze, it can be said that I was completely with nature. That kind of life is the most yearning and the most memorable. For decades, I have always wanted to work hard to do something to solve the problem of life, and go back to that kind of pastoral life as soon as possible. However, I have not achieved anything so far, and the war has broken out.

War can only give some people a chance to get rich, and it is absolutely not good for us writers. Unexpectedly, this war drove us out of the city, allowing me to approach the countryside again by accident, and to live in a thatched hut in the suburbs far away from the city, leaning against the mountains and facing the river. The surrounding area is full of open space, the color of grass enters the curtains, and the sound of insects penetrates the walls. Guests come and say that the scenery is not bad, and I am also complacent, thinking that it is full of poetry. Reading Du Zhanren's line "No wonder the poetic thoughts are clear and human, the door faces the cold stream and the mountains are full of snow", I also feel like I have become a poet who can withstand this compliment.

However, poetry does not help practical life. Even if I am a poet who can chant about the wind and the moon and write a few poems that are clear and human, what is the use? It is better to learn from the farm women to raise a few chickens, which is much more practical.

"You have such a big garden, you can raise chickens: they have plenty of wild food to find, and you don't need to feed them much feed." Those wives who do not have the temperament of poets but are good at managing their homes always say this when they come to my house.

I have heard these words repeatedly, and I am quite tempted, or rather, my index finger is moving (needless to say, the god of poetry has long abandoned me and gone elsewhere). Yes, I want to use this environment to raise chickens. Just raising ten chickens will lay ten eggs every day in the future, which is worth two or three yuan, and now buying a chicken costs more than ten yuan, so ten chickens are also a fortune.

It has been decades since I have lived in such an environment, and I should have engaged in the kind of chicken farming business that has all the benefits and no harm. Regarding production, it is better to do it sooner rather than later. The next day, when I came back from school, I met a seller of chicks on the road, and I bought ten of them from him. Those chicks were released from the cage and got such a large piece of free land. Their joy is definitely not something that we people who are tied to affairs can understand even a fraction of. Although they were born with a fatal fate, they will not know until the very end. Ignorance is happiness, so I can conclude that they are happier than anyone in their short lives. (To be continued)

### Two Brothers Share Three Eyes

— Qian Changnian

Younger brother:

On May 12th, I received a letter from grandfather and was shocked to learn that you were injured in the right eye in Macau due to a school chemistry experiment that was mishandled. Many other students were also injured, but you were the most unfortunate.

Grandfather's letter also said that the next day after the accident, step-grandmother personally accompanied you to Dr. Huang's office in Hong Kong for treatment. This made us feel a little relieved.

On May 19th, I received another letter from grandmother saying that Dr. Huang must first pay a medical fee of HK$300, and it must be paid in full at one time. However, grandfather only had HK$200 left, and after many days of negotiation and delay, he was admitted to the Hong Kong Royal Hospital for diagnosis. Now, thinking about it carefully, the complete loss of your right eye was entirely due to the fault of the delay. And a part of this fault can be blamed on this kind of doctor in society who serves for "money".

Grandfather's third letter (which arrived at noon on May 22nd) finally brought the unfortunate news: your right eye was severely injured and cannot be restored. If it is not treated again, it is feared that it will be delayed to the left eye in two or three years.

When father saw this letter, I saw him standing silently for a while. Having experienced the world, the absence of tears in his eyes does not mean that he is not sad. His heart is praying for the future happiness of his son who has suffered hardships.

Mother, older sister, third sister, and fourth sister all knew the news and hid in several corners to shed tears. How can I comfort them for you? My own eyes were already filled with tears.

What about you? You are the most unfortunate one among us, and I understand your pain: in addition to being sad and indignant for yourself, you also hold a sense of guilt for making everyone in the family share a share of the pain for you.

After six years of separation, I did not expect that you would suffer this unexpected disaster alone when we were about to meet. This June is your twentieth birthday. We were planning to hold a celebration for you when we met. But what is there to celebrate now?

Your intelligence, your perseverance, and your filial piety are the most outstanding among the brothers, but you have suffered this disaster. Is it because of the jealousy of the creator?

I am heartbroken and ashamed that I am just an older brother and can do nothing about your pain. In addition to loving you twice as much in the future, what do you get? You have lost the joy that no price can redeem.

Fortunately, you still have one left eye to use. No, you have more eyes to use than before, because your brother's eyes will always take care of you and protect you from now on until the end of my life.

I hope that after reading my letter, you can "really" feel a little joy. I am unwilling to give you hypocritical sympathy. I want you to know that we are living together, not alone!

When we meet again, I want to see you with the same moving smile as before. Do you promise me? Wishing you health

Older brother May 22nd, under the lamp

### I Am the Mother of Three Children

— Fei

When I think that I, who have been married for only four years, am already the mother of three children, I feel an invisible fear, boredom, joy, and ease—a complex heart, an unspeakable contradiction.

Every child is a record of my pain:

During pregnancy, in addition to physiological morbidity (even vomiting gastric juices), I also had to move around with a big belly to escape the war.

The cramping abdominal pain, wave after wave... My heart is like frozen ice, boiling water!

But this is a bubble, which disappears in an instant, disappears without a trace, a relic! When I see a sleeping little angel lying next to my bed, I forget everything—forget all the sorrows. I like to have a small life more on the earth, and I pray for the growth of this small life!

Qi, Pu, and Xuan are just like their names, all beautiful jades, and all are treasures in my heart!

My heart is deeply connected with my children. Every moment, I pay attention to their food, clothing, sleep, and games. When I go shopping, I will pay attention to the children's clothing displayed in the glass cabinet; when buying vegetables, I will first choose the tomatoes and carrots that Qi loves to eat; if there are any novel toys, I will not forget to buy them the same.

All day long, I am so busy taking care of my children that I can't breathe.

I also have to be careful about the health of my children. A groan from the children is like a needle in my heart, and the needle will not be removed until they are well.

After three years of training, my nerves are particularly sensitive. The children make a slight noise, and I will wake up immediately and urge them to go back to sleep. Looking at the children's apple-like faces, I suddenly feel excited.

With children, I have not enjoyed a fragrant sleep at night; with children, I also have no time to take care of the depth of powder and the height of leather shoes. It seems that the comfort and sustenance that the universe gives me are only children!

I don't admit that this is a sacrifice, but I am willing to fulfill the responsibility of being a "mother".

"I love mom!" When Qi kisses me mischievously, it almost makes me jump up with joy. What tiredness and boredom are there!

Children, Mom is not contradictory! That is, Mom will continue this contradiction forever!

### Education Is...

— Wen Ya

Education is life.

Education is the continuous reorganization of experience, to increase the meaning of experience and to increase the individual's ability to use experience later.

Experience is life, and life is not in emptiness, but in the environment, and comes from this environment.

——John Dewey

### Sundries

From one ton of coal, the following by-products can be obtained: 10,000 cubic feet of coal gas, 25 pounds of ammonium sulfate, 3 gallons of petroleum ether, 6 pounds of liquid ammonia, gallons of tar, and 1,500 pounds of coke.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(8) Tangible Friendship

In fact, Begonia had already seen it before he moved.

The original text of the news is:

'Blood Case in the South of the City

Young Master Shoots and Kills Orderly

The Murderer Has Already Surrendered Himself That Night

The Yuan residence at No. 17 Tieshizi Hutong is another residence of Yuan Baofan, the garrison envoy of Rehe. In addition to Yuan's wife and three concubines living together in one house, his nephew Yuan Shaowen, (24 years old, unmarried, currently serving as a first-class secretary in the Rehe Garrison Envoy's Office and commander of the 31st Mixed Brigade of the Army,) also often stays in the residence whenever Yuan Garrison Envoy comes to Beijing. Last night, Yuan Shaowen questioned the orderly Ji Zhaoxiong (29 years old, from Shan County) about something, and the master and servant suddenly quarreled. Yuan, in a fit of anger, took out a pistol from his arms and fired at Ji, who was shot and killed on the spot. Afterwards, Yuan immediately surrendered himself to the Beijing Police Department and remained in jail awaiting trial. According to reporters, the orderly served as a guard in Yuan's residence in the British Concession of Tianjin. From his arrival in Beijing to being killed, it has been less than five days.'

Begonia looked at this short piece of news for a long time. Yu Kun thought that it was because he only had one eyeball left that he looked slower than others, but in fact, Begonia had already finished reading it. He just opened his eyes wide and was silently in a daze. (116)

### Taylor and Power's Married Life - Written on Their Second Wedding Anniversary

— Qinghui

Two years ago today, Taylor Power, with a bold and decisive spirit, married Annabella in Los Angeles without seeking the company's consent, in a manner as swift as lightning. At the time, most fans—especially female fans—were disappointed, believing that this charming young man was finished from then on, that he had taken the wrong path. With beauties aplenty, he shouldn't have married a foreign actress who had been married once before. Not only did fans feel this way, but many newspapers also expressed similar opinions. Thus, speculative prophets made such predictions: "In 1940, Taylor Power and Annabella will divorce." However, now that 1940 has passed, they have not divorced. On the contrary, their love has increased with the years of marriage! If you don't believe it, let's see how his married life is.

Changed Attitude

Previously, Taylor was completely satisfied with his own suave demeanor, a charming smile that made many women swoon. However, after marriage, he completely changed. Due to Annabella's supervision and encouragement, his attitude became more rigid. He devoted his heart and soul to his work, unafraid of difficulties, striving to succeed. He wants to be known for his acting skills in the future and doesn't want to be known as a generic Hollywood heartthrob. His lifestyle has gradually been assimilated by Annabella, developing an advanced and noble artistic taste, completely different from the restless and impulsive Taylor of the past. This can't be said to be a miracle!

Reading Together in the Boudoir

In these two years, besides work, they often spend quiet evenings together, reading by the lamp. Annabella reads French classics to him, and Taylor reads Shakespeare to her. Initially, Annabella translated for him. Now, after studying French for almost two years, he himself has proven to be a talented scholar. Such recitation is indeed very beneficial to Taylor, not only enriching his wisdom but also benefiting his body and mind. This is truly a good transformation, which must be credited to Annabella. Of course, a virtuous wife is invaluable, especially for a man like Taylor.

Perfect Companion

In Taylor's mind, Annabella is indeed a perfect companion, with seriousness and compassion taking precedence, and enjoyment coming second. No matter what the situation, he never sees Annabella having conflicting feelings, so he can't help but love her. After marriage, Taylor's home is no longer a place for Hollywood youths to frequent. In that magnificent home, one can often see the Colemans, the Charles Boyers, Warner Baxter, and others coming and going, in addition to producers and their wives. Annabella is naturally happy to see that he interacts with such gentlemen, and Taylor is deeply grateful.

Taylor's Confession

Once, Taylor said proudly to a reporter: "Do you remember? I once told you that my ideal wife should have a sense of humor, be dignified and honest, naturally humble, generous and loving, intelligent, able to handle all unexpected stimuli, have the spirit of 'sharing weal and woe,' and be a film actress so that she can understand my life and experiences. Annabella is my ideal woman. She has everything I hope for. Now, I am getting the true joy of life. This kind of life is meaningful, with a happy and comfortable state of mind, and everything is satisfactory. But for all this, I have to thank my Annabella."

### Notes on Pingsheng Kunqu Opera Troupe Rehearsal

— Zou Xiao

The 24th was the 80th birthday of Zhou Jianchu's mother, a member of the Pingsheng Opera Troupe. All the troupe members held a special rehearsal at the Hushe from 2 PM to 12 AM. This troupe has been around for decades, with a constant stream of talent. They haven't had a rehearsal in years, so this was a rare opportunity.

When I arrived, Wu Xinzai was performing "Three Drunkennesses," with a beautiful appearance and solid singing. Next was Shen Shuying's "Eating Tea," full of integrity. Lu Chengzhang and Zhang Yanzhen's "Appreciating Lotuses" was still a maiden work, yet they were surprisingly calm and composed, which was not easy. Wu Yinan's "Sending a Son" was better than his previous performance of Li Qi in "Selling Horses." Xu Xiaoyin, playing the son, had a very loud and pleasant voice. In "Drunken Concubine," Zhang Zifang, playing Emperor Ming of Tang, flicked his sleeves and strode, quite freely and elegantly. Weng Yunshu, playing Yang Guifei, was on stage for the first time, and she also followed the rules. Gong Bingchu was quite competent in "Removing the Seal." Zai Yangzhen's "Foolish Dream" soared into the clouds, refreshing to listen to. In contrast, Ge Qifu's "Pavilion Meeting" had a very soft tone. But Mr. Ge is already fifty-five years old, and the meticulousness and calmness of his performance can be said to be consummate, entering a state of perfection. The raised sleeves and sidelong glances in "Looking at the Moon" and "Looking at the Tree Shade" were particularly beautiful. Yin Zhenxian and Ye Xiaohong are old partners. I have seen their "Quarreling" before, and now I saw their "Kneeling in the Pond." New and old hands are extraordinary. Zhu Yaowen was also very skilled in "Seeing Mother." Ai Tang said that the emotions in this play are mixed, and there can be various facial expressions. I said: "Why not make an exception and let the mother sit sideways and Wang Shipeng kneel sideways, both at right angles to the stage, so that the latter's expression can be seen." Ouyang Yuqian's new "Yutangchun" had made a bold attempt.

After dinner, Yu Bingshen's "Male Boat" passed by amidst the noise in the audience, which was a pity. I have seen Ms. Li Xunru's "Rear Kin" five times, and each time she is more skilled, with very good body movements. Ms. Yin Junong's posture in "Thinking of the Mortal World" and "Shaving Hair" is extremely beautiful. The dancing posture of bending down to the ground is also excellent, and the use of the whisk is very flexible. The finale was "Selling Horses." Wang Zhaochang played the jailer, and his son played Li Qi. I said it was not the jailer interrogating Li Qi, but the father teaching his son in "A Meeting with a Single Blade." Li Qi used to have a very good voice. The father with the small mustache was also successful. Xiao Ming is excellent in both Kunqu and Peking Opera. I saw her perform "Thirteenth Sister" at the Xuan Palace before. This time, I saw her perform Guizhi, showing the different personalities of heroism and gentleness, and I felt her technique was even more consummate, playing whatever she was like. Shen Hengyi's Zhao Chong is extremely restrained and refined. When singing "What grievances do you have in your heart," he does not touch Guizhi's chest but gently pushes Guizhi's shoulders with both hands. When singing "Speak in detail," he does not pull Guizhi's hand inward and outward to flick his sleeves. When Guizhi wakes up, he does not make a sweating gesture, nor does he say "Almost another life was lost." It seems that he is deliberately establishing Zhao Chong's identity, unwilling to go too far, and surpassing ordinary actors.

A Miscellaneous Writing from Shadow City. Huiyi. Barrymore Promotes Young Talent

John Barrymore is a veteran on the Hollywood silver screen. No one can match his qualifications. However, he is extremely diligent in guiding young talents. Therefore, the number of movie stars he has guided is countless. Every time John Barrymore is filming a movie, he takes in many students. These students are actors who are relatively free in the photography field, so that they can get practical practice. Recently, he starred in "The Invisible Woman" and took in many students, so he has the honorary title of Dean of Hollywood Film Circle.

Loretta Young is more proud than before. Loretta Young has been in the film industry for a long time. Last year, she was invited by Universal, and the famous silver filmmaker Frank Lloyd produced "The Lady From Chevenne," which was very successful, so the first film will be produced next, named "The Nioht Ours."

Diana Durbin as Consultant Diana Durbin was recently hired as a consultant by the Greek Relief Association. The chairman of the association, Reid Bi, personally lost her request at the photography scene, and she immediately agreed.

Joe Qi Joins Golden Star After Joining Golden Star, it was heard that he had been assigned to play the role of the murderer in the film "Gunshots in the Rainy Night."

### A Casual Talk on "Working Women"

— Robert

"Zhiyuan Drama Society," this name is quite unfamiliar on the Shanghai drama scene, right? In fact, this drama society is another name for the "Jinan Drama Society," which enjoyed great fame many years ago. "Zhiyuan" is organized by Jinan University's male and female students who love drama. This time, the script for the public performance of "Working Women" was written by Mr. Shi Huafu, a professor in the Department of Foreign Languages ​​at Jinan University. And the director, Mr. Hong Mo, is also an alumnus of Jinan University; This is really a coincidence! "Working Women" is a four-act comedy, full of laughter and satire, targeting reality, so that the audience can recognize the faces of general corrupt people while laughing.

Li Si, who plays the "gentleman" director Fang Weide, is Mr. Li, who often writes for the economics section of this newspaper. He plays it very well, but his movements when courting Miss Zhang Fenglai are still a bit stiff and unnatural. Lucy, who plays Miss Zhang Fenglai, is Miss Tang, who will graduate this summer. Miss Tang has performed on stage many times in Qingxin Girls' High School and National Central University, so she has rich experience and plays it very naturally. Zijin, who plays Mrs. Fang, is very lifelike and convincing. Jin Qin, who plays Fang Yizhuo, is a fool, often eliciting laughter from the audience; However, her movements are sometimes a bit overdone, a bit like "acting"! Gong Ge, who plays Changfu, is very competent. The rest are average, but Honglou, who plays Fang Yihui, doesn't play lively enough, and her pronunciation is too low. Sometimes, people in the audience can't hear what she's saying. Finally, I wish all the members of the "Zhiyuan Drama Society" a great success, and I hope to see more beautiful performances from them in the near future!

### An Abstract of the Philosophy of Diligence

— Zong Yu

Labor is for production, production is for survival, and the labor-based outlook on life is not only for self-sufficiency, but also for supporting others. Only those who can support themselves and others deserve to be called social people in the great era.

### A Pair of Blood-Stained Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 9: Why Did You Come to the Ends of the Earth?

He was sighing when Liu Yin suddenly entered, smiling and asking, "Why is Brother Jing so deep in thought? Is there anything difficult to solve?" Xu Jing didn't want to tell him directly, so he replied, "I think the world is in chaos, with internal and external troubles arising at the same time. I wonder if Zhang Cangqiu and others can make achievements outside the Great Wall? I heard that the bandits have intentions to spy on Jin Province, intending to invade the capital. Their ambitions are not small and should not be regarded as poolside soldiers. I hate the fact that the generals in command are not capable, mediocre and incompetent, sometimes suppressing and sometimes appeasing, wavering and uncertain, which leads to the increasing flames of the bandits. It is difficult to remove the weeds, and I don’t know how to clean up the mess in the future?" Liu Yin said, "Those who occupy positions without doing anything are really killable. I heard that the current emperor is a wise ruler, but unfortunately, there is no one to assist him, and the country is getting worse day by day. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will wield a three-foot long sword with Brother Jing to clear away these demons." Xu Jing heard Liu Yin speak so passionately, and his eyebrows were raised, and his righteousness was visible on his face, so he said, "I will follow my virtuous brother and work hard together, so as not to let down the seven-foot body of a man." Liu Yin laughed again after hearing this and said, "Of the 140,000 people who laid down their armor together, not one was a man. There are many men in the world who are often afraid of death and stealing their lives. It is better to be a city lady army, who can also defend the country." Xu Jing was taken aback when he heard this. Liu Yin continued. "I hope that we can hold weapons to defend the country and increase its glory, to get rid of the shame of the past." Xu Jing smiled and said, "What you said is so straightforward, my virtuous brother. In a few days, I will go with you to see General Zhou Yuji, so that he can serve under his command." Liu Yin said; "I have a temper, that is, I don't like to ask to see people. As for fame and fortune, I don't care. I just want to do whatever I want. If I want to stay, I will stay, and if I want to leave, I will leave. So I don't want to be under the control of others, otherwise, why would I live in seclusion here?" Xu Jing nodded and said, "This is your noble ambition, indifferent to fame and fortune, and different from others." After dinner, Xu Jing said to Liu Yin: I want to go to bed early tonight, and maybe I will have to say goodbye and go down the mountain tomorrow to take a walk in the city.” Liu Yin heard this and said, “Then Brother Jing go to sleep early. We can talk tomorrow." So Liu Yin went back to his room. He lived in the same room with his aunt. After Xu Jing waited for Liu Yin to leave, he sat for a moment, closing his eyes to rest. Listening to the outside, there was no sound, he quickly stood up and took off his coat, put the Scarlet Phoenix Sword on his back and waist, and put on the Bailian Rope. He put out the candles, tiptoed out of the bedroom. He closed the door, and secretly opened a window in the study, jumped to the courtyard outside, and closed the window again. Fortunately, the walls were very low, Xu Jing had already jumped onto the wall and jumped out of the door. The starlight was shining, he looked around and saw no one, so he strode down Phoenix Ridge. He was on guard against wolves, but fortunately he didn't encounter any. He also hurriedly passed over Suanmao Ridge, left Weifeng Mountain, and flew to Daizhou City. (73—End of Chapter 9)
