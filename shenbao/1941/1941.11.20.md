### Preliminary Washington Exploratory Talks; U.S.-Japan Understanding Shows No Despair; China and Britain Deeply Concerned and Maintain Contact with the U.S.; Tokyo Remarks Have Aroused Reactions from All Sides

United Press, Washington, 19th – Special Envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura conferred again with Secretary of State Hull yesterday. Afterwards, Ambassador Nomura told people that he felt there was "still hope" for a satisfactory result. When Ambassador Nomura stepped into the State Department at the beginning of the meeting, he said to the crowded group of reporters, "Why are the newspapers so pessimistic? We are very optimistic. You Americans are usually straightforward and fearless people, so why can't you get the idea of war out of your heads?" General Nomura and Kurusu held talks with Mr. Hull for two hours and forty-five minutes. Hull told the press that if the Japanese diplomatic representatives informed him that they were prepared to continue negotiations, then he would continue the talks next week. He also said that he believed the matters discussed would be relayed to Tokyo by the Japanese representatives. Before the negotiations continue, the Japanese special envoys particularly hope to receive a response from the Japanese government. When the two Japanese ambassadors walked out of the State Department, they were both in good spirits. Hull said that all that can be said at present is that what is being discussed is ordinary consideration and not special details. He also said that the talks are of an exploratory nature and have not entered the stage of formal diplomatic negotiations. He declined to say whether the two sides had put forward a general solution to all problems in the Far East, and also declined to say whether the talks had made satisfactory progress. When asked whether any points had been agreed upon with each other, Hull said that he could not answer this question, lest it give rise to misleading information. When asked whether the two Japanese envoys seemed eager to avoid a U.S.-Japan war, Hull said that the best way to ask this question would be to ask the two special envoys directly. Mr. Kurusu told reporters that he would prefer Mr. Hull to issue a formal communique, so that there would not be two different statements issued at the same time. Someone told Mr. Nomura that the length of their talks was enough to break the State Department's record. Mr. Nomura said, "This is probably because I am not proficient in English." Observers believe that when Mr. Hull explained the U.S. policy, he clearly indicated to the Japanese envoys that if Japan could change its foreign policy as the U.S. said, then Japan would benefit from it.

United Press, Washington, 19th – President Roosevelt said yesterday that he believed he would meet with Special Envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura soon, but he had not made any definite arrangements with them. When asked about other issues related to Japan, the President told reporters that he had no news to announce. Kurusu and Nomura met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday. It is reported that they had consulted with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull for a long time on Monday. Both of them were in good spirits when they walked out of the State Department yesterday.

United Press, Washington, 19th – Authoritative sources here revealed today that the British are fully aware of the situation of the U.S.-Japan talks. Secretary of State Hull attended the meeting for nearly three hours yesterday. Afterwards, British Ambassador to the U.S. Lord Halifax visited Hull, which shows Britain's concern for the talks. Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih also met with Hull yesterday, which shows that the Chinese side is probably fully aware of the general issues related to the U.S.-Japan talks.

United Press, Chongqing, 19th – Authoritative sources here announced today that the Chinese side here believes that Prime Minister Tojo's three principles are an open challenge to the United States. In addition, Shimada and other Japanese Diet members have fiercely attacked the United States, so it is believed that Kurusu's mission will definitely fail. Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and other Chinese government leaders have said that they believe that after the recent attacks on the United States by Shimada in Tokyo, it will be difficult for the U.S. and Japan to reach an agreement, because the attacks from Tokyo have ruined Japan's hope of persuading the United States. The Chinese here are unmoved by the speeches in the Japanese Diet. Well-informed sources explained, "Japan now seems to be explaining to the U.S. government and people that Japan and the United States cannot reconcile on the Pacific issue. We are confident that the Japanese will effectively prove this point." Well-informed sources pointed out that although the Japanese do not yet show signs of attacking Kwangsi in the near future, China and the U.S. have been closely preparing to welcome the Japanese invasion. A large number of Chinese troops are now on high alert, and the U.S. volunteer air force has also made technical preparations so that it can fight immediately.

The so-called Three Diplomatic Principles of Japan are Unanimously Denounced by American Newspapers as Arrogant

United Press, New York, 19th – New York and Washington newspapers yesterday expressed extreme doubt about the success of Kurusu's trip. Commentators from various newspapers unanimously condemned Prime Minister Hideki Tojo's three principles for Pacific peace announced in the Diet. The "New York Times" stated, "These conditions of Japan are absurd. The Japanese Prime Minister cannot hope that the United States will change its traditional policies due to Japan's demands." The title of the "New York Herald Tribune" editorial was "Togo and Japanese Peace." It stated that understanding Japan's "true intentions" is the only definite answer, and that views on peace differ. A certain kind of peace is more hateful to us than war. This is the reality in Asia. The more Japan believes in the justice of its mission, the more irreconcilable its ideas of a new order are with the American ideas of an orderly world. The "Washington Post" stated in an editorial commenting on the speeches of Tojo and Togo, "There is no sign that Japan is prepared to make any concessions to the demands of the United States. On the contrary, Japan insists on making demands on the United States that are tantamount to an ultimatum. If Japan is willing to show its colors, it can get them."

Reuters Special Correspondent, Washington, 19th – Shimada's hostile remarks in the Diet yesterday, which simply advocated that Japan immediately declare war on the United States, have caused a reaction here that can be described as surprising. Shimada made strange arguments when he supported a resolution that identified the United States as the root cause of the current European war. On Monday, Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Togo also made equally fierce remarks, so the general impression here is that the Japanese government is eager to destroy its mission to the United States, and Kurusu can be said to be a special envoy carrying outward peace but inward bricks. However, observers who are familiar with the Japanese and their actions feel that their remarks are just a large-scale bluff aimed at seizing the best negotiation results. The general attitude here can be seen in the words of Scripps Howard newspaper commentator Clapper, who said that Tokyo's remarks directly demand that the United States completely abandon its policies and listen to Japan's arbitrary actions. If Kurusu can turn this kind of demand into a peaceful solution, then Kurusu is not only a politician but also a magician. If Tojo's remarks can represent Japan's final negotiating position, then there is no possibility of compromise between the U.S. and Japanese governments except for mutual discord. The "Baltimore Sun" stated that Kurusu's government had given him a questionable background when his elbow theory began, and Tojo's third expectation, that is, that third countries should try to prevent the European war from affecting the Pacific, is even more ridiculous. In fact, the responsibility for turning this expectation into reality lies with Japan, because Japan is one of the Axis powers and a country that has been at war in Asia for many years. In terms of Tojo's second point, trade with Japan will naturally return to normal when Japan mends its ways. As for Tojo's first point, the United States insists on its principle of not recognizing changes in the status quo caused by force. If Kurusu is bound by Tojo's expectations, then his discussion will definitely have no results.

London Pays Close Attention to the Progress of Negotiations, Believing that the Safety of the Pacific is at Stake

Reuters, London, 19th – The safety of the Pacific situation is currently uncertain, so the British government is now paying close attention to the U.S.-Japan talks being held in Washington with deep interest, and close contact is still maintained between Britain and the United States. The general reaction here to the remarks of the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister is extremely unfavorable. The Japanese Diet has also passed a fierce anti-American resolution, which makes the prospects for the Washington talks and Pacific peace not optimistic. British newspapers such as "The Times" and "Manchester Guardian" have all tried their best to refute Tojo and Togo's remarks on the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, pointing out that they hinder the possibility of a solution. The "Yorkshire Post" commented on Tojo's three points, and its remarks can represent the general trend of public opinion, saying that if these conditions are accepted, then the British and American governments will directly abandon the basic points of their policies. The "News Chronicle" pointed out that Tojo's first condition is an arrogant demand. Most British newspapers said that if Tojo's three points are the basic principles on which the Washington talks are conducted, then the failure of Kurusu's mission will be undoubted. The U.S. government will have sufficient reason to leave Kurusu to take a boat back to Japan immediately and declare to the Japanese government that the United States does not want to negotiate under threat. The "Daily Telegraph" mentioned Thailand and said that the Japanese army, electricity, and air force are concentrated in northern Vietnam, and there is now a rumor that they are advancing on two routes to the Thai border. The "Daily Mail" said that if the Soviet Union's position does not deteriorate, then Japan may not challenge it. The talks in Washington are just a strategy for Japan to delay time to see what happens. The "Manchester Guardian" warned the Pacific powers not to repeat the mistakes of the former Russian Empire, which did not prepare and was suddenly attacked by Japan. Although the Pacific situation can be pessimistic, the British government's policy has not changed slightly, that is, on the one hand, it hopes for a peaceful solution, and on the other hand, it prepares to deal with emergencies.

China, Which Has Sacrificed for Anti-Aggression, Believes that the United States Will Definitely Uphold Justice

Reuters, Chongqing, 19th – Although Chinese newspapers all believe that the United States will definitely uphold international justice and Chinese sovereignty, some newspapers are quite surprised that the United States is still negotiating with Kurusu after Prime Minister Tojo has made unreasonable demands in the Diet. The Da Gong Bao editorial said, "Kurusu has firmly advocated strengthening Japan's relationship with the Axis powers, and Kurusu is also the representative of Japan who signed the Tripartite Pact. Yet President Roosevelt still received him at the White House. It is truly a strange thing. It is truly unbelievable that the person who created the Tripartite Alliance and the person who created the Atlantic Charter are shaking hands and sitting down to talk with each other. We firmly believe in the perfection of President Roosevelt's personality and the determination of American policy, but we have to admit that the special drama performed in the White House is enough to cause strange reactions among the anti-aggression nations, and may even cause some doubts."

Reuters, Washington, 19th – Senator Pepper, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently told reporters that if a war in the Pacific is the price of resisting Japanese harassment, then war will definitely occur. If Japan wants peace, it should immediately stop aggression and withdraw from China. The United States will never tacitly approve of any so-called order built on the bones of the innocent and washed with blood. We have already witnessed their killings and trampling in most parts of the earth. The "Daily News," New York's only newspaper to criticize U.S.-Japan relations, hopes that war can be avoided. All radio commentators believe that the recently proposed Japanese peace is incredible.

It is Difficult to Say Whether the Future of Negotiations Will Succeed or Fail; The Japanese Side Claims to Have Completed Preparations

United Press, Tokyo, 19th – Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo remained extremely silent yesterday when asked if Saburo Kurusu had conveyed Prime Minister Hideki Tojo's three principles to Washington. In the Lower House Budget Committee, Nakajima asked what relationship Prime Minister Tojo's three principles had with Kurusu's mission. Togo said that Kurusu was dispatched to Washington to assist Ambassador Nomura in continuing negotiations. He said that the government had not given Kurusu any special new instructions, because negotiations had been going on in Washington for a long time. Togo also said that Mr. Kurusu must have learned of these three principles, but he refused Nakajima's request and refused to explain them. When answering questions about the future of the Washington negotiations and their relationship with Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, he said, "The future of the negotiations cannot be predicted. As for its relationship with the Tripartite Pact, it should be clarified according to the development of the situation. I am unwilling to answer this kind of hypothetical question." Nakajima raised the question of whether national defense had been prepared as well as the Japanese people to cope with the worst-case scenario. Prime Minister Tojo, in his capacity as Minister of the Army, replied, "The army is fully prepared to cope with any changes in the situation." Naval Minister Shigetaro Shimada also said, "The navy has completed all necessary preparations."

United Press, Tokyo, 19th – Major Tominaga of the Army Intelligence Bureau rebuked the United States on the radio last night for launching the ABCD encirclement against Japan. The nationalist "Kokumin Shimbun" published Major Tominaga's speech in a big way, saying that British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, India, Burma, and China are actually puppets of the United States. The "Kokumin Shimbun" published his speech saying, "Japan will henceforth limit its attitude towards the hostile actions of the ABCD countries, so I urge the people to prepare to deal with this situation."

### The King of Thailand Issues an Order Appointing Commanders of the Three Armed Forces; Four Japanese Warships Arrive in Saigon, Intending to Increase Pressure on Thailand

Reuters, Bangkok, 19th – After the King of Thailand issued an order to establish the Supreme Command of the Thai Armed Forces, another order was issued last night appointing General Sangkram as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Senkram Cher as Minister of the Navy, and Taeval Tait as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force. The Supreme Command has the power to control all troops. The first announcement of the Supreme Command contains the appointment of the Chief of Staff of the Former Enemy and the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of National Defense. Various leaders related to defense yesterday afternoon

Reuters, London, 19th – According to news here today, the recent arrival of four Japanese cruisers in Saigon may indicate that Japan is now increasing its pressure on Thailand. There seems to be no special reason for this action other than a show of force.

Reuters, Bangkok, 19th – According to official sources, British Minister to Thailand Sir Josiah Crosby met with Thai Prime Minister Sangkram yesterday for an hour.

### Britain Refreshes Army Lineup; Important Transfers of Generals; Brooke Promoted to Chief of Staff; Dill Appointed Governor of Bombay; Paget Appointed Commander of Home Forces

Reuters, London, 19th – According to an announcement last night, there have been many transfers of British generals. General Dill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, will retire from his position as Chief of Staff on Christmas Day when he turns sixty. His successor is General Brooke (58 years old), the current Commander of the Home Forces. The King has conferred the rank of General on Dill and has approved Dill as the Governor of Bombay in India, succeeding Lumley after his term expires. Lieutenant General Bonnell, Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff, has been decided to be transferred to another position, and his vacancy will be filled by Major General Nye. Lieutenant General Paget, Commander-in-Chief of the Southeastern Command, will succeed Brooke as Commander of the Home Forces, and his vacancy will be filled by Lieutenant General Montgomery. It is reported that after Brooke takes office as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, he will be responsible to the Secretary of State for War for future British military operations. Brooke succeeded General Ironside as Commander of the Home Forces in July 1940 to arrange British defenses to prevent enemy forces from invading. During the French campaign, Brooke also led the British Second Army Corps in combat against the mechanized German army. General Dill was promoted from Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff to Chief of Staff in May 1940. Afterwards, Dill also led the British Expeditionary Force's First Army Corps in battle in France and is known for his expertise in strategy. Lumley, the current Governor of Bombay, took office in April 1937 and has a term of five years. The new Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Major General Nye, is 46 years old and is one of Britain's young generals. His predecessor, Lieutenant General Bonnell, is also one of Britain's young generals, 53 years old. In 1939, he served as Chief of Staff of the Far East Expeditionary Force, and the following year he served as Inspector General of the Home Forces. In May, he was transferred to Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff. The new Commander of the Home Forces, Lieutenant General Paget, is 53 years old and has led troops in battle in Norway. General Montgomery is 54 years old and has led the British 3rd Division in battle in France. In April, he was appointed Commander of the Southeastern Command of England.

Reuters, London, 19th – British newspapers mostly express their approval of the changes in key figures in the British military, believing that because the scope of the war is large and there are many changes, military managers feel that the work is very繁重, so their term of office should be limited to balance work and rest. Reuters military correspondent Moore said that this change is a harbinger of Britain's engagement in land warfare in a more active form.

### Important Bills Passed by the Japanese Diet

Reuters, Tokyo, 19th – Today's joint meeting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers unanimously approved the supplementary budget bill, as well as bills to increase taxes, control rice, control major industries, amend air defense laws, control postal services, and amend military service laws.

### Japanese Residents Withdraw from the Dutch East Indies

United Press, Batavia, 19th – Japanese Consul General Ishizawa here warned Japanese residents in the Dutch East Indies yesterday to use a certain Japanese ship sailing on November 28 to return to their country. Japanese barbershops and other small businesses in Batavia have been quickly closed. Reliable sources said that only a small number of Japanese will now remain in the Dutch East Indies, because smaller businesses cannot operate after the implementation of freezing restrictions here. Ishii's wife and children returned to their country by ship on November 9.

Reuters, Washington, 19th – According to responsible sources, President Roosevelt may not take action temporarily on the strike occupying the mines, pending the conclusion of the Industrial Organization Conference being held in Detroit. It is reported that 50,000 troops have been ordered to prepare to take over the mines in case the stalemate cannot be broken. The troops are well prepared, and the takeover can be completed within a few hours. The House Labor Committee began considering the strike bill today. The chairman of the committee, Democrat Mrs. Norton, predicted that the case would be referred to the council next week. According to the leading military officers responsible for preparing to take over the mines, if the troops are ordered to enter the mines, 75 percent of the strikers will automatically return to work out of patriotic sentiment, and the remaining 25 percent will gradually resume work within a few weeks. According to a military officer, the plan to occupy the mines was completed yesterday. The troops will only carry ordinary weapons and no tanks or artillery, because the troops will treat the miners as friends and guarantee that they will peacefully continue their work. After the miners' strike in Bensonville, Somerset Town, it is estimated that 24 places that are co-operating with the mine are implementing sympathy strikes. It is reported that approximately 32 coal mine workers in Kentucky will go on strike today.

Chongqing The National Political Council held its fourth and fifth plenary sessions on the 19th, both in the morning and afternoon, to hear government reports. The morning session covered internal affairs and food, while the afternoon session covered education, agriculture, and forestry. As of the 19th, all ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan had completed their reports, except for the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuans, which had submitted written reports. The details of the fourth and fifth plenary sessions are recorded as follows:

Fourth Plenary Session

The fourth plenary session began at 8:00 AM, attended by members of the presidium Zhang Boling, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junmai, Wu Yifang, and councilors Tan Zan, Xiao Yishan, Yu Yuzhi, Peng Jieshi, Shi Lei, Kang Shaozhou, Lu Zongqi, and 167 others. Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, Secretaries Lei Zhen and Gu Xiwu, and heads of ministries and commissions, including Dai Fuxian, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Chonghui, He Yingqin, Zhou Zhongyue, Xu Kan, Gu Zhenggang, Jiang Tingfu, and more than forty others were also present. Chairman Zhang Boling presided over the session. First, Minister Zhou Chuiyue of the Ministry of Interior reported on internal affairs work. Regarding the supervision and implementation of the new county system and local autonomy, after the promulgation of the outline for county-level organizations, in order to assess the implementation performance of each province, the "Outline for the Implementation of County-Level Organizations in Each Province and Supervision and Assessment Plan" was formulated, and personnel were dispatched for on-site inspections. Significant progress has been made in areas such as adjusting institutions, organizing Baojia (mutual responsibility system), conducting household surveys, promoting schools, consolidating finances, and organizing cooperatives. An outline for training cadres at all levels has been drafted to train cadres in stages to meet urgent needs. Regarding the clarification of household registration laws and regulations, efforts are being made to formulate detailed rules for the implementation of household registration to ensure simplicity and ease of implementation. Concurrently, household administration cadres are being trained, with the goal of completing preliminary household surveys by the end of next year. Regarding the consolidation and enhancement of police administration, financial assistance is being provided to police education in various provinces and cities. Police personnel are being actively trained to strengthen police capabilities and improve police treatment, thereby enhancing their service effectiveness. Regarding the preparation for land price declaration, various regulations have been drafted and a land price declaration office has been established to formulate plans for phased implementation. Regarding the consolidation of grain storage in various provinces and cities, measures for cleaning up stored grain and grain funds have been drafted and are being actively implemented. Regarding the inspection teams for banning opium and drugs, they have been dispatched to various provinces to conduct thorough investigations and strict supervision. In addition, measures have been taken to investigate and prohibit opium and drugs in war zones and recovered areas to ensure complete eradication. After the report, many councilors raised inquiries, which the Minister of Interior addressed. Subsequently, Minister Xu Kan of the Ministry of Food reported on the recent work of the ministry. Minister Xu first stated that the Ministry of Food was established this year during a very serious grain shortage. Fortunately, the drought did not materialize, and the harvest was abundant. With the establishment of supply offices in the capital and other locations, switching from specialized merchants to certified merchants, and with the assistance of gentry and civilians in various regions, the crisis has been successfully overcome. The supply offices in the capital and Sichuan Province are gradually expanding, rice prices have begun to fall, and grain reserves are now abundant. Particular attention is being paid to the planning of military grain. After the conversion of land tax to in-kind collection, it has been uniformly implemented in all provinces since the second half of this year. At the same time, a fixed-price purchase method is also being adopted to complement the in-kind land tax collection. As a result, not only has the military grain problem been completely resolved, but there is also surplus grain for public grain supply, market regulation, and price control. The central government has also allocated grain to provinces with shortages for circulation, so that surpluses and deficits are balanced, and panic is avoided. Other difficult issues, such as the special sale of grain, the management of storage and transportation, and the collection, allocation, and supply of military and civilian food, are unavoidable, but with active planning and gradual improvement, they will also gradually yield results. After Minister Xu reported on the work of the ministry, he also reported in detail on the future policy direction. Following the report, more than twenty inquiries were raised by the councilors, detailing the advantages and disadvantages of implementing grain policies in various regions and the improvements that should be made in the future, demonstrating the importance attached to the current grain problem. Subsequently, the presidium, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 11 and 13 of the Rules of Procedure, proposed candidates for the members and conveners of the various review committees, which were approved by the general assembly. The list of members and conveners of the various review committees is recorded below: (Review Committees) (1) Military and National Defense Group: Chou Ao, Li Xiangen, Geng Yi, Chen Weizhen, Guo Zhongwei, Wu Xijiu, Ju Lijing, Wang Hansheng, Song Yuanyuan, Tan Wenbin, Yang Ziyi, Zhang Zhijiang, Zhou Daogang, Wang Huayi, Li Yongxin, Li Qia, Zhang Xiruo, Su Ludai, Shen Junru, Hu Ziang, Lu Qian, Leng Yu, Hu Ruohua, Hu Zhongshi.

### Chicago Overseas Chinese Tan Zan Arrives in Chongqing; Brings Donations from Overseas Chinese; Will Present to Chairman Chiang for Comfort and Disaster Relief

Chongqing Overseas Chinese leader Tan Zan from Chicago arrived in Chongqing yesterday and paid his respects to Chairman Lin. He is expected to attend the National Political Council today. Tan brought three proposals: (1) The government should send commercial commissioners to the United States to investigate the preferences of American consumers so that Chinese goods can cater to their tastes. (2) Many overseas Chinese children do not recognize Chinese characters or cannot speak Chinese; the government should send teachers to the United States to educate them. (3) Some provisions in the U.S. immigration law cause inconvenience to overseas Chinese; it is hoped that negotiations can be conducted to improve them. According to Tan, when he passed through Hong Kong, he mentioned that the overseas Chinese in Chicago had donated US$1.4 million for the anti-Japanese war effort. This means that the average donation per person among the more than 2,000 overseas Chinese in the city is US$700. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)

### Gifts Celebrating the National Day of China Presented to Chairman Chiang

Therefore, we pray for the glorious day when victory arrives. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)

### US Newspaper Says Many American Ships Will Carry Supplies to China; US to Send 300 Personnel to Train Pilots Due to China's Lack of Bomber Pilots

Washington According to well-informed foreign news reports, the Yunnan-Burma Road, although a route for assisting China, is now rapidly transforming into a major route for American military strategy. American experts are now preparing to make the road capable of supplying American troops entering China, and construction and repair facilities are being built along the road to ensure that transportation can resume within an hour of any bombing. In addition, a railway running parallel to the road is currently being laid under American supervision. Washington now feels that if war breaks out with Japan, sending American troops to China will not face the same opposition as the American Expeditionary Force sent to Europe. Quoting senior officials, the newspaper said that sending the American Expeditionary Force to Europe might face strong opposition, but as far as Japan is concerned, we should restrain the people from doing so. The newspaper also said that China is currently lacking pilots for bomber, but the United States has sent 300 experienced pilots to train Chinese aviators to form the core of China's powerful air combat force. The US-Japan talks have not stopped, and these preparations mean that at least 80 American ships will sail to China with supplies between now and May 1 next year. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)

### Post Office Explains Reason for Refusing Women Applicants: Requires Service in Occupied Areas, Heavy Workload, and Unsuitable for Women

Chongqing

The Post Office's refusal to hire married women was protested by women's organizations in advance, and now councilors have also raised inquiries. According to the Post Office's explanation, the reason why women were not allowed to apply for this year's recruitment is that postal workers are mostly assigned to serve in occupied areas, and the current volume of mail is very high, making the work very heavy, which is not suitable for women. Therefore, restrictions have been placed on married women, which will be lifted after the victory of the anti-Japanese war. In addition, due to transportation problems, the transfer of mail is often difficult, so the Post Office hopes that all sectors will refrain from sending Christmas and New Year's greeting cards this year, which is also a way to save money.

Editorial

### Analysis of US-Japan Negotiations

After the arrival of Japan's special envoy Kurusu in the United States, he has met with US authorities twice. Both sides have maintained a mysterious silence regarding the progress of the talks. Formal negotiations have not yet begun, and it is difficult to predict their success or failure. However, considering the reactions from various parties in recent days, a pessimistic attitude seems to prevail, which warrants careful examination.

The dispute between the US and Japan in the Pacific is not a new issue, dating back more than twenty years. The relative peace maintained in the decade or so following the last European war was primarily due to both sides agreeing to the principles of safeguarding China's independence and territorial integrity in the Washington Conference. Since the September 18th Incident, when Japan occupied Northeast China, the fundamental principles of the Nine-Power Treaty were first undermined, indirectly causing a new conflict between the US and Japan. Over the past ten years, relations between the two countries have fluctuated, but Japan's creation of a situation in the Far East by force is undoubtedly the main obstacle between the US and Japan. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, US-Japan relations became even more strained. Although the US authorities, constrained by isolationist factions, could not take measures to uphold the dignity of treaties and deter acts of aggression based on their consistent beliefs, their consistent "non-recognition policy" was sufficient to indicate the US's dissent and reservations regarding the Far East situation. When Japan put forward the slogan of a "New Order in East Asia," continued its southern advance, and formed a military alliance with the Axis powers, taking advantage of the European war to expand and coerce Britain and the United States, US-Japan relations rapidly deteriorated, reaching a critical point with the US's freezing of Japanese assets and imposition of an embargo this summer. During this period, Japan has repeatedly made it a priority to ease relations with the United States. The Abe Cabinet and the second and third Konoe Cabinets actively sought compromise, but ultimately, no progress was made due to the fundamental differences in views between the two sides. Now that Kurusu has been sent to the United States, the world sees it as the final negotiation. Both the US and Japan are making preparations for any eventuality. This tense situation, watched by all, is unprecedented in the history of the Pacific. At this point, the US's consistent firm stance has been repeatedly stated by the Washington authorities as unchangeable. On the Japanese side, there is no sign of changing course. The issue of China is particularly critical, and the views of both sides are now clearly diametrically opposed except for the common goal of maintaining peace in the Pacific. From this, it can be seen that the pessimism expressed by the world is by no means a subjective prejudice.

So, is Kurusu's trip really as some observers believe, meaningless except for delaying time? Perhaps the facts may be so, but the Japanese authorities, despite appearing increasingly aggressive, are not without expectations for Kurusu's trip. Coinciding with Kurusu's meeting with Hull in Washington, the reports of the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister on administrative policies and foreign policy in the Japanese provisional Diet aroused unanimous antipathy from Britain and the United States. In particular, the explanation of the resolution on completing national policy proposed by Shimada Toshio on the 18th on behalf of various factions of the House of Representatives, as well as the resolution on that proposal, blamed Britain and the United States and placed all responsibility on the US authorities, hoping that the Japanese government would pursue everything with the aim of achieving the objectives of the war, casting a shadow over the ongoing Hull-Nomura-Kurusu talks. These were certainly a form of threat, but also a kind of external maneuver. What really deserves attention are the three principles put forward by Tojo. Among these three principles, the first, "Third countries must not hinder Japan's policy of resolving the China Incident," and the second, "All countries must not make military threats against Japan and must lift the economic blockade and restore normal economic relations," are Japan's main demands, while the third, "Preventing the expansion of the European war to the Far East," is merely a supporting point. Whether the conditions presented by Kurusu to the United States are the same is unknown, but it is believable that these three items must be the main basis for Japan's negotiations with the United States and other democratic countries. Anyone can see that such demands are contrary to the US's position of not recognizing the use of force to change the status quo and "opposing aggression and threats outside the country by force," and as with the first point, it is by no means a matter that the US authorities can consider in negotiations with Japan. However, in the eyes of the Japanese, this is not without offering considerable concessions. First, the issue of the obligations of the Tripartite Pact was not included in Japan's three items. Tojo also hardly mentioned this in his speech, implying that Japan could, if necessary, withdraw from the obligations of the alliance. The Axis relationship can be broken, and the third point, "Doing its utmost to prevent the expansion of the European war to the Far East," can also be interpreted as meaning that Japan is not prepared to fight for the Axis in the Far East. Second, regarding the southern advance, Tojo also lightly mentioned it with the phrase "Japan's peaceful progress in the South," without emphasizing demands for the South Seas. This naturally cannot be immediately regarded as the Japanese authorities' preparation to stop the southern advance, but it may not be a condition for exchanging American concessions. Taking a comprehensive view of Tojo's declared policies, it can be said that he is aiming at the US's emphasis on the European situation and concern for the South Seas and using it, while on the other hand, he is demanding that the United States and other democratic countries stop aiding China and lift the emergency preparations in the Far East and the economic blockade against Japan. It is worth recalling that when Tojo took office, he first put forward "winning the war against China." Now, comparing it with the policies he announced in the Diet, it can be roughly seen that Kurusu's negotiations in the United States, while intended to ease US-Japan relations, are still primarily aimed at "resolving the China Incident" at their core.

The deterioration of US-Japan relations to this point is naturally a consequence of the Tripartite Pact and the southern advance policy, while the war between China and Japan and Japan's desire to expand on the Asian continent are the most fundamental causes. Unless the United States fundamentally changes its consistent policy towards the Far East over the past twenty years and its repeatedly declared anti-aggression stance in recent years, it can be asserted that any negotiations with the United States based on Tojo's three principles are bound to fail. Japan's bargaining and further concessions are certainly not impossible, but judging from the various developments within Japan, it is extremely difficult to reach a consensus with the United States. Even if at most a partial compromise is reluctantly reached, it will only delay the crisis in the Pacific without fundamentally easing it.

### German Forces Launch New Offensive South of Moscow, Attempting to Cut Off Oil Supply Lines; Tula's Soviet Troops Fight Bravely and Successfully Counterattack

Reuters, London, 19th: German forces have launched a new offensive south of Moscow, aiming to reach the railway line north of Rostov-on-Don to prevent oil and other supplies from southern Russia from reaching Moscow. Since Thursday, they have been attacking east of Orel, about 200 miles from the Soviet capital. According to a Reuters correspondent in Kuibyshev, the Soviet army is putting up extremely strong resistance and inflicting heavy losses on the German forces. However, a Soviet army led by Goniansky has been forced to retreat and abandon several villages. At Tula, 110 miles south of Moscow, German forces have been contained in both frontal attacks and attempts to attack the northwest of the city. The German official news agency announced on Tuesday night that the improving weather has allowed German forces to launch new attacks on Soviet positions in the Donets Basin, and the resistance of Soviet forces has been broken in many places, with German forces advancing rapidly. German sources claim to have occupied the eastern part of the Crimean Peninsula, but this has not been confirmed by the Soviet side. The German news agency claims that Kerch, which has been captured by German forces, has been protected by the latest warships and has extensive fortifications around the city.

Reuters, London, 19th: A war dispatch from the Soviet newspaper Pravda states that the positions of Soviet troops in Tula on the Moscow front have been greatly improved after a counterattack. On Sunday, German forces launched attacks again, using tanks to attack Tula, but they were stopped before reaching the city limits, with several tanks destroyed by Soviet artillery and the rest fleeing. After the failure of the frontal attack, German forces changed their strategy and attacked the northwest of the city in an attempt to reach the highway between Tula and Serpukhov, but they were also unsuccessful. The fighting has continued for several days, and according to the lowest estimates, the German forces in the area have suffered more than 2,500 casualties.

### Soviet Forces Firmly Defend the Gateway to the Caucasus, Repelling Two German Advances

Reuters, London, 19th: A war dispatch from Pravda on the southern front states that General Kleist's German forces have been severely damaged and have been unable to advance for several days. However, after reinforcements, they attempted to break through the defenses before Rostov.

On Sunday, enemy infantry, supported by tanks, twice attempted to break through the defenses of the Soviet "K" sector before Rostov. Soviet forces counterattacked with artillery and machine guns, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy and driving them back to their original positions. A military commentator for Reuters in London said that the fighting between Rostov and the Donets Basin is as before and is expected to intensify again. German sources claim that the weather has improved, and the frozen ground has allowed German forces to resume their offensive, pushing Soviet troops out of several positions and continuing to occupy several industrial areas. These claims are unusually vague. Moscow sources report that German forces have twice advanced on the Rostov front lines, but have been heavily repelled.

### The Soviet Union Uses Armored Aircraft to Counter Tanks with Amazing Results

TASS, Moscow, 19th: The Soviet Union has recently invented several new weapons, one of which is a low-flying tank-destroying bomber. This bomber is equipped with pure steel armor to avoid enemy anti-aircraft fire and has achieved great success after trial use. In the past three months, the Tolsykov fleet alone has destroyed 608 German tanks, 1,750 trucks, and 272 aircraft, and has eliminated 10,000 enemy soldiers. The enemy is currently very afraid of this special aircraft. At the same time, Soviet infantry has also obtained automatic rifles for shooting tanks. These rifles can penetrate enemy tank turrets at a distance of 400 meters. In addition, Soviet tanks have more strategies such as outnumbered ambushes and fuel weapons. The number of German tanks being destroyed is increasing.

### Travel on the Sichuan River (1)

— Ji Sheng

The river flows gently, creating ripples even without wind. Are those wrinkles on the water or your money? Today is a clear and peaceful spring day.

Go on! The terrain compels you forward. Don't fear the long journey! Don't fear the bumpy road! The vast, boundless sea is followed by the plains where the rivers run dry. There are your companions, stirring up waves that touch the sky.

I am used to the gentle flow of water. Last year, traveling west, the car sped through the hills of eastern Jiangxi. Streams with slight eddies flashed past my eyes, and I couldn't help but sing like this.

Waiting for a bus in Ningdu, I had time to walk around the suburbs. It was just such a stream that attracted me to lean against a willow tree and stare at it for over an hour. I always had a peculiar feeling in my heart: this is a familiar pattern, why can't I explain it concretely? The inspiration was finally captured: Ah! What a piece of drifting, unsteady, high-quality crinkled silk! The fine ripples shone with a silky sheen; the swirls formed by many curves were like clouds on the crinkled silk. The clever pattern maker has already appreciated this natural beauty before me and applied it to the patterns of silk.

Arriving in Sichuan, the river flows even more rapidly. For more than a year, I have traveled back and forth between eastern and western Sichuan twice. When I couldn't catch the bus or boat, I took wooden boats several times. In the slowness, I intimately appreciated the taste of sailing on the Sichuan River. Of course, the crinkled silk-like river water, drifting sometimes fast and sometimes slow, was the object of my gaze, reverie, and passing time. In each drifting section (the "shoals" in Sichuan, formed by stone blockages or the steepness of the riverbed), it made a "hong" sound, showing tremendous power, which made me tremble with awe and admiration.

The number of days required for ships to travel each section of the Sichuan River is roughly half the time it takes to go upstream. The ticket price is set accordingly. However, this ratio does not apply to wooden boats. Going downstream, you can still predict the arrival date. If you want to ask an upstream boatman when he will arrive at his destination, his answer will definitely be simple and unpleasant: "Don't ask about the road when sailing a boat!" Indeed, there are too many difficulties in sailing upstream on the Sichuan River. Besides the known difficulties, there are also some unpredictable obstacles and dangers. When the water rises, the shoals are rapid, and the boat cannot be pulled up the shoals; when the water falls, the water in the shoals is shallow, and the boat will run aground if one is not careful. Sometimes, when the cable is being pulled tightly to cross a rapid shoal, the cable suddenly breaks, and the danger at this time is unimaginable. Even if you are lucky and the rudder is handled properly, avoiding sinking, the boat will have to go downstream, and it is unknown when it can reconnect to the tow cable and return to its original position. It is not uncommon for an upstream boat to moor next to a small village for several days while waiting for a sunny day. At this time, even the most slow-tempered person will feel the difficulty of the road to Sichuan.

After the Mid-Autumn Festival, I passed through Yibin and took a boat to Leshan. The next day, the boat was ten miles from Jianwei. The engine struggled with a sloping shoal for two hours, unable to move forward. Shortly after the captain announced the failure of the advance, our novel journey began.

Gathering nine passengers, we chartered a small wooden boat. To be fast, it was stipulated that male passengers must often walk ashore. This, for me, was not objectionable except for its novelty. Taking off my heavy jacket, I crossed the pebble beach and walked onto the green grass. The autumn wind gently brushed my thin shirt and trousers, and I felt unusually refreshed. In less than a few hundred steps, a small red stream blocked the way, and there were no tools for crossing the river. After murmuring for a while, one by one, we had to follow the boatman's footsteps and wade across the water. This was the first time I had walked barefoot in Sichuan. When a pair of bare feet were inserted into the blood-red, sparkling fine sand, how soft and comfortable it felt. "Crossing the river! Ha, ha..." The movie "Back to Nature" began to play.

### US Navy Secretary Announces Armed Merchant Ship Program; Vessels Sailing to the UK and Northern Europe Take Priority, Followed by Those Heading to the Red Sea Port

Knox did not say when arming would begin, but other officials expect it to begin within the week.

Havas, Washington, 18th: Navy Secretary Knox did not mention the Soviet Union in his speech, but people in the shipping industry believe that what he called Northern Europe includes the Soviet port of Arkhangelsk.

### The US Industrial Organizations Federation Decides to Support the Government; Urges Acceleration of Production to Aid China, Britain, and the Soviet Union; Admonishes Against Falling Prey to the Treachery of Corrupt Elements

Reuters, Detroit, 19th: The American Industrial Organizations Federation held its annual meeting yesterday and unanimously passed the board of directors' proposal after four hours of discussion, fully supporting President Roosevelt's policy of aiding China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. It stated that this policy is of great importance to the security of the country. Therefore, the American Industrial Organizations Federation supports the President's foreign policy and supports the amendment to the Neutrality Act. Efforts by people like Lindbergh aimed at dividing the American people must be regarded as Hitler's Fifth Column. The American people demand that those who harbor Hitler in the United States, such as the puppet representatives of Vichy France or the Quislings, not be allowed to sow the seeds of division among the people. In a letter to the conference, President Roosevelt said that we must produce guns, tanks, planes, and ships as quickly as possible without delay. The American government and people are determined to obtain this goal.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Met Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Taking Over the American Defense Zone; Commanders of Defense Forces of Various Countries Also Met Yesterday; It Is Reported that the Volunteers Will Expand Their Enrollment; Japan Expressed to the Authorities its Intention to Increase Japanese Police Officers

The Shanghai Municipal Council met yesterday afternoon to discuss who would take over the public concession "C" zone after the withdrawal of the American troops. It is reported that Japan intends to abandon its request for Japanese troops to patrol the area in exchange for adding Japanese officers to the Public Concession Police. According to foreign businessmen, if the number of Japanese police officers in the police department increases, the Japanese authorities will allow the Shanghai International Volunteers to patrol the "C" area together with the police. The Japanese authorities have informed the Public Concession authorities of this intention, and it is thought that great progress has been made in the consultations between the two sides. Since the Japanese have this definite plan, they are keeping silent on the issue of taking over the American defense zone. In the Japanese plan, they also agree that the director of the police department should still be a non-Japanese person. At the same time, Phillypu, the general manager and director of the Municipal Council, also said that the council met yesterday afternoon to discuss the "C" zone issue. However, it is unpredictable what kind of resolutions will be made at the meeting or whether further meetings will be held before a definite position can be agreed upon. Representatives of the defense forces stationed in Shanghai did not attend the council meeting.

### Defense Force Commanders Met Last Night

It is learned that last night, following the Municipal Council meeting, the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai also convened an emergency meeting to discuss the issue of taking over the defense of the "C" zone after the withdrawal of the American troops. In addition to Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the American Yangtze River Fleet, and Colonel Howard, commander of the American Fourth Marine Regiment, the commanders of the defense forces of Italy, France, and Japan also attended. The British defense forces had already withdrawn, but the naval authorities stationed in Shanghai still sent a representative to the meeting. The content of the meeting was kept strictly confidential by the five national defense forces. It was also revealed from another source that the defense force meeting to resolve the takeover issue would be announced the day before the American troops withdraw. Therefore, last night's meeting was only preliminary. It is reported that Commander Glassford of the American fleet had previously discussed this issue with Colonel Howard and other senior American officers at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday. After the meeting, Glassford visited Takeda, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps. The content of the meeting is unknown. It is also learned that the commander of the Volunteers also participated in the defense force commanders' meeting last night, but this statement has not been officially confirmed.

### It Is Reported that the Volunteers Will Add 500 Members

It is rumored that British officials in the Public Concession, due to the impending withdrawal of the American Fourth Marine Regiment from Shanghai, are planning to recruit 500 members for the Shanghai International Volunteers in order to address the issue of security within the Concession in the future. They are currently in discussions with US officials. However, in fact, it is very difficult to recruit British troops. Therefore, it is rumored that a group of White Russians incorporated into the police force and some British will be reorganized into a team, but it is unknown whether this matter can be realized.

### Date of Withdrawal of the Fourth Marine Regiment

It is heard that the first batch of American troops is scheduled to withdraw from Shanghai on the 25th, and the military camps sent will be handed over to the Shanghai International Volunteers. However, it is under negotiation. The US Naval Hospital has been decided to be handed over to the Municipal Council. It is also the case that the US Navy stationed in Tianjin will take the US presidential transport ship, which is currently being requisitioned, directly from Qinhuangdao to Manila this weekend, without stopping at Shanghai. The American President Company's President Madison is scheduled to arrive in port around Friday of this week and leave the next day. The President Harrison will arrive next Monday and will also set sail the next day. Both rounds will go to Manila, but the company did not explain whether the US Marines stationed in the city will withdraw on the two mail ships. However, door-to-door boat sales are still normal.

### May Hold a Farewell Drill

The US Fourth Marine Regiment, which has been stationed in Shanghai for 14 years, will march to the ship in formation when it departs. Before the departure, there may be a farewell drill held on the racecourse. If the drill plan is realized, foreigners in the city will flock to watch the drill, which is bound to be a grand occasion. When the American troops march to the ship, it is expected that they will travel east along Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road. The exact date is a military secret and has not been disclosed.

### Colonel Howard Met with the Japanese Side Yesterday

Colonel Howard, commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment, visited the Japanese Army Liaison Officer and Japanese Gendarmerie officials stationed in Shanghai yesterday morning to bid farewell. Major Hamilton and Captain Patrick of the US Army accompanied Colonel Howard on his farewell visit. Both sides expressed their gratitude for each other's cooperation. From 6 to 8 p.m. this Friday, the US Small Business Association of this city will host a banquet at the American Association to bid farewell to Colonel Howard and the officers of the regiment. The consuls general of Chile, Mexico, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Brazil stationed in Shanghai will also host a banquet for Colonel Howard and other military officers at the Columbia Country Club on the same day.

### Price Limits for Second Batch of Goods to be Announced Next Week

It is learned that the Importers and Manufacturers Association presided over by the Municipal Council has compiled a new retail price limit list, which will soon be included in the scope of control of the authorities.

### All Rice in Warehouses Will Be Purchased

The Shanghai General Cereal, Bean, and Rice Association, to discuss the issue of 650,000 bags of rice stored in the city's rice warehouses being purchased by the Public Works Department (工部局), held a special temporary meeting yesterday at 10:00 AM at its clubhouse at 15 Avenue Edward VII. According to a letter from the Public Works Department, "The Public Works Department is willing to purchase all the rice at a price of 148 yuan per bag (224 pounds), except for rice that is of poor quality or broken." After discussion, it was resolved that if the authorities purchase the rice at 148 yuan per bag (224 pounds), the losses for the members would be significant, making it difficult to sell at this price.

### U.S. Destroyer Captures German Ship

On the 6th of this month, the U.S. destroyer "Omaha" captured the German "Odenwald" of the Hamburg-America Line, which was disguised as an American merchant ship, while patrolling the equatorial waters of the Atlantic Ocean. It is reported that the original German crew of the ship, numbering 33, are still residing in the Hongkew district of Shanghai. The "Odenwald" departed from Shanghai on September 1, 1939, and traveled to the United States via Yokohama, two days before Britain declared war on Germany. Before leaving Shanghai, the ship dismissed its 33 German crew members and hired 37 Chinese sailors in their place. The German crew planned to return to their country, but the outbreak of war forced them to stay in Shanghai, residing on the German ship "Ramses," which was stranded in Shanghai due to the war. Three months ago, when the "Ramses" left Shanghai, the crew moved to the Hongkew district. At the same time, the "Odenwald" also took refuge in Yokohama due to the outbreak of war. The Chinese crew were all dismissed and returned to Shanghai on an American President Line ship. Two of them died on the ship during the voyage.

The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that Mr. Liddell, Chairman of the Board, and Dr. Minders, a director, presented a report to the board meeting yesterday afternoon (the 19th) regarding their trip to Hong Kong and negotiations with the Price Stabilization Fund Committee. According to the report:

Foreign Exchange for Foodstuffs Secured for Four Months

The Price Stabilization Fund Committee has already provided foreign exchange for four months, starting from November of this year, to purchase 140,000 tons of rice, as well as large quantities of flour and cooking oil, in order to drastically lower prices. In addition, a large amount of foreign exchange has been allocated to purchase coal. The Price Stabilization Fund Committee has expressed sympathetic importance to the significance of supplying Shanghai with essential goods, so the public can rest assured. There is now no reason to lose faith in Shanghai's future as it has been lost in recent months. The Price Stabilization Fund Committee does not intend to supply foreign exchange for luxury goods, but the Board is confident that the Committee will be able to supply the foreign exchange needed for all items essential to the lives of both Chinese and foreign residents in this city.

Avoid Hoarding; Cooperation is Desired

The public should not panic each other and should refrain from hoarding. The Committee will not approve any foreign exchange for the purchase of goods for hoarding or resale at black market prices. At the same time, the Board will do its best to stabilize the market situation, but this will be difficult to achieve without the support of the citizens. The Board unanimously expressed satisfaction with the report of the two gentlemen and expressed their admiration for their work.

Goods Sold Separately Must Have Labels

The Public Works Department has issued a notice stipulating that all goods sold separately by retail stores, which have been announced by the Bureau as subject to price controls, must be labeled, stating the price per pound, per dozen, or per item in figures at least one inch and one point in size.

Rules for Registering Purchases and Inventory

The Public Works Department has issued a notice stating that all individuals, partnerships, or companies that sell separately any goods that have been announced by the Bureau as subject to price controls must comply with the following rules: The date of purchase and from whom the goods were purchased must be recorded daily. The quantity of each type of goods sold to customers must be recorded daily, or, to the extent possible, diligently record all detailed records, such as sales slips or account books, which must be readily available for inspection. Anyone selling wholesale quantities of goods must record the names and addresses of the buyers for each transaction separately. Inventory on hand must be recorded daily, or, to the extent possible, diligently recorded. The records must correspond to the sales records. This record must include all inventory belonging to the individual, partnership, or company. If any inventory is not stored at the retail location, its storage location must be certified. All records prepared in accordance with this notice may be inspected at any time by officials duly appointed by the Bureau.

Regulations for Licenses of Candy Stores, Etc.

The Public Works Department has issued a notice stating that, starting from November 20 of this year, the license regulations for bakeries, confectionery stores, dairy farms, food and beverage stalls, foreign food stores, Chinese food stores outside of restaurants, foreign wine shops outside of restaurants, fruit stalls, beer halls outside of restaurants, private vegetable markets, and stores selling other foods in Category 1 (ice cream), Category 2 (meals), Category 3 (rice), Category 4 (soda, fruit juice, etc.), tobacco stores and stalls, and wine shops outside of restaurants will all add the following clause: "If any licensee refuses to sell any inventory that has been announced by the Bureau as subject to price controls, the Bureau may revoke their license and confiscate the inventory."

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Announcement of Last Session's Accounts: Surplus of Over 33,270 Yuan; Deep Appreciation for Support of Education from All Sectors; Matters Concerning the Second Session of Scholarships to be Held Immediately

This newspaper announced the establishment of the "Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund" on July 13th of this year. We are deeply grateful for the enthusiastic donations and support from all sectors of society, which has allowed impoverished students to focus on their studies with peace of mind. The sincerity of people from all walks of life, who have acted righteously to benefit young people, is not only deeply appreciated by the students, but also benefits the educational and cultural fields. The assistance provided is deeply appreciated. The staff of this newspaper are grateful for the guidance of all sectors, and are ashamed to have made no contribution, but have been spared from failure. We will now publish the income and expenditure accounts and a general overview of the first scholarship fund as follows. The details of the continued operation of the second scholarship fund will be published in this newspaper tomorrow.

Income: From July 13th to the end of October of the 30th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1941], a total of 67,007 yuan and 93 cents was received from readers' donations to the scholarship fund.

Expenditures: In this period, 41 university students were paid a total of 4,573 yuan; 225 middle school students were paid a total of 13,395 yuan and 70 cents; 79 elementary school students were paid a total of 2,641 yuan and 50 cents; 521 students in industrial and commercial after-school classes were paid a total of 12,370 yuan and 40 cents. The three disaster-stricken children, Ni Zhaoqi, Bao Jiazeng, and Wu Gensheng, were each subsidized 500 yuan per year until they completed junior high school, as decided at the first meeting of the association, with a total of 4,500 yuan to be allocated. A total of 750 yuan was paid out in this period. The above five items totaled 869 students, with a total payment of 33,730 yuan and 60 cents.

Balance: After paying out the expenses, the total balance is 33,277 yuan and 33 cents.

Extreme Gratitude for the Enthusiasm of All Sectors: During this period, all companies and firms generously donated to the scholarship fund, and were extremely enthusiastic. Calligraphers, painters, writers, movie stars, male and female students from various schools, factory owners, workers, and even children also generously donated. Various schools donated free academic places, and entrusted the association to review and recommend students. This widespread expression of compassion from all sectors is truly commendable. In addition, we are grateful to Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Chen Qingshi, Mr. Nie Lingyu, Mr. Lu Gaoyi, and Mr. Zhao Zongyu for kindly serving as members of the Scholarship Fund Committee, providing much guidance and assistance to the staff. We are also grateful to readers from all walks of life for their constant supervision. The staff will respectfully treat this as a guiding principle and always bear it in mind.

Students in School Should Work Harder

As for the students who have received assistance in this period, they are now diligently studying. In addition to the staff having the opportunity to meet them while investigating the family circumstances of each student, we have not been able to express our encouragement in person. However, now that the students have received financial assistance from various sectors of society, they should be deeply moved by the great expectations of people from all walks of life. When the academic achievements of the students in this period are announced, it will be the day when the students respond to the enthusiastic support of all sectors, and it will also be the day when the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Movement returns the gifts of the students' achievements to all sectors of society. Society does not fail the students, and the students should have something to offer to not fail society. As the academic studies of this period are now nearing the halfway point, we would like to add a word, hoping that the students will work hard to meet the expectations of society.

All Scholarship Income is Returned to the Public

Finally, what we wish to report to all sectors of society is that the expenditures under this scholarship fund are purely for the purpose of allocating funds to the students for academic expenses. As for all supplies and materials and transportation expenses for investigating the family circumstances of each student, no expenses were paid, either provided by this newspaper or paid out of the staff's own pockets. This is a small gesture to ensure that all scholarship income is returned to the public, and to avoid wasting the efforts of people from all walks of life. The staff is ashamed of the limitations of their abilities, and can only repay the readers with the sincerity of wishing to serve them. We hope that all sectors will constantly supervise and guide us, so that the scholarship fund movement can develop and grow. This would be our greatest hope.

### Impersonating Mailmen to Sell Goods: Post Office Investigating

Recently, tricksters have been found in this city wearing green uniforms, impersonating post office mailmen, entering and exiting public residences to peddle goods. The postal authorities are now appealing to the public to pay attention. Personnel wearing postal uniforms are strictly prohibited from engaging in other businesses besides performing their own duties. These postal workers not only wear uniforms, but also have badges affixed with their photographs. To safeguard the interests of both the public and the post office, it is hoped that the public will cooperate with the post office. In the future, if you encounter someone wearing a postal uniform coming to public residences to peddle goods, you can first ask to see their badge. If they can show their badge, please notify the post office of their name and number for further action. Otherwise, if they cannot show their badge, please immediately report it to the nearest police station for investigation according to law.

### Japanese Ship Sinks in Wusong: Over Two Hundred People Drowned; *Basae Maru* Suddenly Sinks, No Signs of Cause

The motor vessel *Basae Maru* (transliteration) of the Japanese shipping company Toyo Transportation Company, with a deadweight of 63 tons, regularly traveled between Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River. On Monday morning, it was returning to Shanghai from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River when it suddenly sank near the mouth of Wusong.

Two Hundred Chinese Buried at Sea

In addition to a large quantity of cotton being lost with the ship, more than 200 Chinese passengers were also buried at sea. A ship from the Japanese East Asia Shipping Company saw the *Basae Maru* gradually sinking from afar and quickly sailed to rescue it, but by the time it arrived, the *Basae Maru* had disappeared without a trace, and there were no traces of oil or other signs to indicate where it had sunk. It is reported that the Japanese naval authorities dispatched a ship to rescue the passengers after receiving the report, but as of yesterday morning, no passengers had been found. It is feared that all the people on board have tragically drowned.

Sudden Sinking, No Time to Escape

According to well-informed sources, the *Basae Maru* likely sank suddenly, and the crew and passengers had no time to escape and sank with the ship. This is a rare tragedy in the Yangtze River. The cause of the disaster remains a mystery.

The women's group championship of the Middle School Volleyball League was won by Minli. Jinan and Guanghua Attached Middle Schools both obtained the finals qualification with six wins in six matches. It was originally scheduled to determine the champion this weekend, but because there were students from Guanghua who were not from the school participating, the organizing authorities investigated and found it to be true, and the qualification for the competition was canceled according to regulations. As a result, Jinan won the men's group championship with six wins in six matches. There are still four final matches this weekend (the 13th), held at the Guogiang Middle School at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Cardinal Mercier. The competition is now declared a success. The schedule for the weekend is listed below:

### This Year's Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match Expected to be Held

(Hong Kong News) The Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match has been suspended in recent years due to the changing international situation and unstable times. In order to plan ahead, the General Association proposed a discussion at last month's meeting and sent a letter to the Shanghai General Association to seek their opinion so that if the Shanghai team does not come, they can invite a team from Singapore or Manila to Hong Kong. According to reliable sources, the Shanghai West United Association is holding an emergency meeting on this matter. After a long discussion, the following three issues were raised: 1. The travel expenses of the Shanghai team to Hong Kong need to be considered because the value of legal tender is low and the difference with Hong Kong dollars is too large. 2. The shipping schedule for returning to Shanghai must be accurate. 3. If there are no changes in the Far East situation, sending a team to Hong Kong is more likely. According to the reporter's observation, based on the current situation, there may be no changes in the situation in the short term. As for travel expenses and shipping schedules, these are not difficult problems and can be solved through correspondence between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Therefore, the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match is certain to be realized during the Lunar New Year next year. If the Shanghai team can come to Hong Kong this time, it will be an all-Western team, probably a team composed of Western police officers, French businessmen, Portuguese, and Lax elites.

### Spun Yarn Speculation Active; Double Horse Buying Enthusiasm Most Intense; Futures of Both Rise to Limit

The yarn market continues to be tight, and the yarn trend has resurfaced. This is because the U.S.-Japan negotiations have eased, and there may not be a breakdown for the time being. As a result, speculative buyers and [blank] have become more enthusiastic. At the same time, the passing of the ball trade of miscellaneous brand yarns is not as dull as in the past, and the players are more lively. As a result, the chips are tight, and the rising trend is strong. The highest price of 20-count Double Horse factory single was 2,790 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,725 yuan.

The opening momentum of Double Horse in the morning was still [blank]. The opening price was 2,650 yuan, and it soon fell to 2,625 yuan. However, the market was bullish, and it slowly rose to 2,680 yuan. At the same time, the yarn price in the exchange rose, and people's hearts were also tight. However, Double Horse orders lingered within the 2,700 yuan mark for quite a while. Until near the close of the market, the short positions were all covered, and the situation suddenly became tense. There were also rumors of good news, with hopes of export. It suddenly broke through the 2,700 yuan mark to 2,740 yuan. The closing price was 2,730 yuan. The half-day turnover was 4,150 bales.

The market opened bullish in the afternoon because the yarn for this month at the exchange jumped another 150-160 yuan. The market was greatly shaken, and the buying enthusiasm was even stronger. Double Horse went straight up to 2,790 yuan and announced a limit up. The off-market price reached 2,800 yuan. The distant-month yarn at the exchange also reached the limit up.

The futures market situation of Jinbi Horse is that the development abroad is relatively smooth, and the news is gradually easing. The hearts of all parties have turned to stability, and buying enthusiasm has reappeared. At the beginning of the morning, there was no progress in the news, and many parties were temporarily watching. Sellers were hesitant, and the market atmosphere was still calm. The October opening was 2,420 yuan, December 2,555 yuan, and January 2,670 yuan. Afterwards, because the upstream of the gold market and the factory orders took the lead in soaring, the futures market was excited, and the Zhengjin and [blank] gangs absorbed a lot. The demand on the market exceeded the supply, and the market price rose in a straight line. The near-term close rose to 2,580 yuan in the morning, up 160 yuan, December 2,700 yuan, also up 130 yuan, and January 2,780 yuan, up 110 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying enthusiasm continued. With the support of the exchange's firmness, the market price soared, and it rose to the limit again. The recent close was 2,620 yuan, December 2,770 yuan, and January 2,870 yuan, each up 200 yuan. Looking at the trend, if the international situation may ease, the trend may continue to be firm, but the new buyers are mostly cautious. The table is listed below:

November, December, January, Opening, 2415.0, 2555.0, 2670.0, Highest, 2620.0, 2770.0, 2870.0, Lowest, 2410.0, 2555.0, 2640.0, Closing, 2620.0, 2770.0, 2870.0, Comparison, Up 200.0, Up 200.0, Up 200.0

### Cotton Follows Yarn in Rising

The current cotton situation is bullish following yesterday's market, but the factory appetite has not developed. However, people's hearts have turned to excitement again. Today, 40 bales of cotton are being shipped to Xiamen. The flower number movement yesterday is listed below: [blank] Languo

The New York cotton market fell first because of selling by Southern traders and spot merchants, but then rose again due to buying by colleagues and short covering. As a result, the closing price was about 3-4 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell first due to selling by professional merchants, then rose back due to buying by the public, but finally, the market fell again due to selling by European exporters and profit-taking by bulls. The closing price yesterday rose slightly, about 3 rupees. It is also predicted that the market opening today will be the same as the closing price, with no rise or fall.

### Despite the Continuous Arrival of Foreign Sugar in Shanghai, Sugar and Grain Are Only Allowed to Rise and Not Fall, Resulting in Manipulated Futures and Sparse Spot

Sugar transported by the Taikoo Company from Zhangjiakou arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 18th) in the afternoon. A large amount of 16,000 bags of sugar shipped from Hong Kong was unloaded at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. The Jinan Wheel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also transporting 1,170 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and was also docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. (Year)

The sugar market is rough because the 20th is near the delivery date. The transactions made on the 13th and 14th of this month were canceled by the Joint Venture Company as being inconsistent with the regulations. The market opened as usual today, and the delivery was handled according to the usual practice. The 20th period opened at 254 yuan in the morning and closed at 46 yuan and a half, with a highest price of 60 yuan and a lowest price of 46 yuan and a half. The off-market price was 39 yuan. The market opened at 55 yuan in the afternoon and closed at 35 yuan, with a highest price of 55 yuan and a lowest price of 31 yuan. The 30th period opened at 258 yuan in the morning and closed at 61 yuan, with a highest price of 69 yuan and a lowest price of 61 yuan. The off-market price was 59 yuan. The market opened at 65 yuan in the afternoon and closed at 73 yuan and eight corners, with a highest price of 82 yuan and a lowest price of 65 yuan. The situation is still chaotic. Spot goods were completely suspended in the morning and slightly traded in the afternoon. Goods arriving in October were priced at 272 yuan and one corner, which is still traded under the restriction of only allowing rises and not allowing falls, so the transaction is almost zero. The price of Dutch Red was 116 yuan, 90 yuan, and 98 yuan to 205 yuan in the afternoon. The price of Hong Kong Crude was 232 yuan in the afternoon, up 7 yuan. The price of Taikoo Che Bai B ginseng bag Zhuang was 225 yuan, DY ginseng 220 yuan, and HX 200 yuan to 08 yuan in the morning and 220 yuan in the afternoon, up more than 10 yuan. More than 45,000 bags of futures were traded and more than 4,000 bags of spot goods were traded.

### Haberdashery Holders Reinvigorated

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market soared, which was due to the fact that although the actual demand was weak, speculative buying was very strong. In the afternoon, the momentum was particularly strong. As a result, white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill rose by 4 yuan to 10 yuan per bolt, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 5 yuan. Named brand goods rose more. Customer sales were still bleak. Fellow traders and holders in this street traded more than 500 pieces, and 32 pieces of haberdashery were shipped to Xiamen.

East Cloth: Because people's hearts were bullish, the current futures were consistently strong. The Caiqiu standard cloth in the exchange rose by 2.9 yuan to 3.6 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, it was heard that Double Horse yarn had risen to the limit, and the rising trend was even stronger, rising another 5-6 yuan. As a result, each month rose sharply by 8 yuan to 10 yuan and 1 corner compared to the previous day. The closing price for this month was 94 yuan and 5 corners, December 96 yuan, and January 97 yuan and 9 corners. The spot leader factory single was also strongly risen by 9.5 yuan to a closing price of 104 yuan and 5 corners. The new single of Four Gentlemen Serge was 3 yuan, 7 corners, 8 and a half points, which continued to rise by 3 corners and 1 point.

### Bureau Rice Purchased in Large Quantities; No News of Bureau Flour; Stored Flour Still Rampant

The continuous arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai by the Shanghai Municipal Council has been repeatedly reported. It is learned that the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, also transported 10,200 bags of foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong, and was docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. It is heard that in addition to purchasing and transporting from Hong Kong, the Shanghai Municipal Council has now directly ordered a large batch of small ground rice from Yangon and has agreed with Jardine Matheson to send ships to Yangon to transport it to Shanghai. (Zu)

There was no market for foreign rice yesterday, while more than 100 bags of domestic rice were transferred out through Hongkou. The price of high-grade rice was fixed and the price of second-grade rice was tired. The market was still flat.

Yesterday, except for a little embellishment in the actual consumption of foreign flour, the general speculators, holders, and brokers who rushed to the wind were thinking about moving after a long period of quiet. The blindly following people also thought that the low price of flour, more than 20 yuan, was an opportunity to add to their purchases, and the market suddenly showed a prosperous atmosphere. Moreover, since the authorities did not strictly restrict foreign flour, this activity was allowed to move at will. The opening price of Jinlong brand was 40 yuan, then it was increased by 3-5 corners, and then it was raised to 41-42 yuan. The prices of the Fort brand were from 42 yuan to [blank] yuan and 3 corners, which was a sharp increase of 2-3 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the inventory in the market is extremely thick. Taking the Jinlong and Fort brands ordered by VITA foreign firm as an example, there are still tens of thousands of bags of warehouse receipts that have been repeatedly urged but not shipped. There are even more huge total amounts handled by transfer warehouses and other foreign firms. With this huge amount of inventory in the market, it is inevitable that it will be affected by the equal-price public sale of flour.

### Control Has Become the Ending; No Market and Storing Trend is Flourishing Again

In the miscellaneous grains market, as control is gradually coming to an end, afternoon trading was restored yesterday. Due to enthusiastic national buying, the market prices of various goods were firm and strong. Under the absorption of the rice industry and speculative oil brokers, edible oil prices rose by about 20 yuan. Corn also saw a rise of 2-3 yuan due to the active kicking of the ball. Red sorghum was strong and expensive by about 2 yuan, and soybeans were tight. The Tongshi sold 40 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 100 pieces of Jiangbei raw oil, 50 barrels of Daxu soybean oil, and more than 1,000 dan of Dayou Qing oil. There were also 600 dan of rapeseed oil, 300 barrels of rapeseed oil from Nichihua, Yoshida, Taishan, Kawaminami, and Dachangxin factories, more than 500 bags of Tianjin Jinwu, 200 bags of Xinqing beans, more than 10 carts of Mingguang red sorghum, more than 4,000 bags of spot corn, and more than 300 tons of futures.

### Sudden Buying is Strong Again; Cash is Heavily Expensive

Yesterday, the cash market suddenly turned bullish. The price has returned to outside the 19,000 yuan mark, which was pulled up by the banks' pouring in. Although Xianghe offered 510 taels, and Decheng and Tianyuan each offered more than 300 taels, and Chengji and Mingfeng also squeezed out, it could only create a small spin situation. Dafeng actually re-entered 1,620 taels, and Defu entered 500 taels. The follow-up buyers raised the price wildly. The price on that day rose from 18,600 yuan to 19,550 yuan, and finally rose by 880 yuan. The total transaction for the day was more than 12,200 taels. Decorative gold also rose by 60 yuan to 1,980 yuan. The black market price of pattern silver was 23 yuan.

### Black Exchange Still Has No Market

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, both HSBC and the Central Exchange rates were flat. The small [blank] counter price of Lanfeng was fixed. The British and American exchange black market had no price and no market. A certain Chinese merchant broker was selling two pence and one two five of British exchange and three yuan of U.S. exchange for transfer in the United States, but no one was interested. However, the export foreign firms sold the April telegraphic transfer to HSBC at a price of 5.40625 U.S. dollars, which was not a large amount.

### Tongyi Opened and Bought; The Domestic Debt Market Improved Slightly

The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday was originally in a spin-and-wait situation, where it could rise or fall. Suddenly, the newly listed Tongyi Bank bought a large amount, which aroused the interest of many parties. The C type once again rushed to the 70 yuan mark. The situation of the U.S.-Japan talks, both sides remained conservatively silent, and the news was therefore quite dull. Before any clues were published, public bonds were still inevitable to spin. Yesterday morning, Senji first sold out, and the opening price of C type was 9 yuan and 2 corners. It happened that Tongyi Bank was newly opened, and the buying was very strong. The market price immediately gradually went up and was raised to 9 yuan and 56 corners. At that time, Dingkang also took the opportunity to buy in, and with the joint efforts of both forces, it was raised to outside the 70 yuan mark. At the same time, Runde and Hongda also bought in, and Jiufeng sold more. Shengda and Yichang also supplied. At the closing, Changji had a slight need, and the market price was fixed. In the afternoon, Runde continued to buy in, and Hengkang and Tongkang both had the appetite to enter. Jiufeng and Yichang continued to sell, and Lianhe also sold out. The market price slightly relaxed, and the situation was still slightly out of the spinning state. As a result, the market price uniformly returned up by 3 corners to 6 corners, and the transaction was about 1.5 million yuan.

### Vermicelli Sell Well and Become Tighter

Recently, the sales of line vermicelli have been lively, and the market has tightened. In addition, most of the goods in the hands of the industry are concentrated in a few companies, so the prices are easier to tighten. Yesterday, the market price of Longkou vermicelli was 450 yuan, and Qingdao vermicelli was 430 yuan, which was 30 yards higher than at the beginning of this month.

### Today's Export Goods

795 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen, 520 bags to Hong Kong, and 150 bags to Singapore. 620 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Xiamen, 4,120 pieces to Hong Kong, and 620 pieces to Singapore. 1,445 cans of raw oil and 100 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Xiamen, 370 cans of sesame oil. 1,019 boxes of tea were shipped to Hong Kong and 19 boxes to Singapore.

### The Fall of the Speculator

— Sun Jieren

The sky has unpredictable storms.

Our manager's fiftieth birthday is not far off, and colleagues are calculating what to give as birthday gifts: some are giving banners, some are giving silver shields, and some are giving gift certificates worth fifty or a hundred yuan... And me? Terrible.

This problem bothered me for the better part of the day, but finally, I remembered Old Li, my only fellow townsman and friend in Shanghai. Moreover, I heard that he's been doing quite well lately. "Regardless of whether it works or not, it won't take much effort, so let's just give it a try!" Thinking this way, I made up my mind.

On Saturday afternoon, taking advantage of some free time, I put on my only flannel suit and went straight to his place.

When I arrived at his house, he happened to be home. Seeing me from afar, he shouted "Old Sun" and came out of the house to greet me.

His house was a very beautiful and impressive front building, facing south, with many windows and modern furnishings. Compared to my dark and smelly attic, it was like heaven and earth. Moreover, I remembered that the last time I came, the furniture didn't seem as new or as good as it was now, and the walls didn't seem to be painted blue like they were now.

"Old Sun, do you think I've tidied up this house nicely?" Old Li asked with a chuckle, seeing me staring blankly at his room, while offering me a cigarette.

"Uh, uh, that, that... Modern, extremely modern!"

"Shoddy cigarettes, Three-Five brand, please make do!" Old Li said, pointing proudly at the cigarette in his hand.

"No, no, Three-Five brand is not bad, right? Heh, heh, you're too polite!" I wanted to say that I usually only smoke the butts of "Ten Scenery Brand" cigarettes, but I finally held back.

Old Li's sharp suit kept flashing, shining brightly. "It must be made of that something... something-ding... something-ding!" I thought to myself, and couldn't help but feel a surge of embarrassment about my only suit, which was, in fact, made twelve years ago.

"I recently heard that you, my old brother, are doing very well. I wonder where you're making a fortune?" I said, wanting to get to the point quickly.

"Making a fortune? It's just doing some miscellaneous affairs in that ×× Bank! But I often hoard some goods and just get by!" Old Li answered nonchalantly, but he emphasized the words "hoard some goods," as if to show his pride.

"Uh, uh, uh, that's very good, that's very good," I echoed, but my stomach was already filled with anger.

"Unless you don't have money, don't say anything about it. Otherwise, it would be unfair not to take the opportunity to make some money!" Old Li said even more happily. I was almost bursting with anger. According to my temperament, I would have run away, but the manager's gift was not a trivial matter, so I could only endure it.

"If it weren't for that time when the Sanbai Bao Shuangma hurt me, hey! Hey! Old Sun, I could have had at least a few more thousand yuan in my hands." He suddenly said with unusual regret. I didn't respond. I felt it was better to be straightforward with him, as the things he was talking about didn't suit me at all.

"I'm visiting your residence today because... hey, hey, it's... for a small matter!" I struggled for a long time before finally speaking, but my cheeks were already flushed red.

"What is it?" Old Li asked in surprise.

"Because I want to give the manager a gift, but I don't have enough money on hand, so I want to... want to borrow some from you..." To be honest, although I'm poor, borrowing money from someone was still a first for me in my life.

"So that's the matter. Why didn't you say so earlier? How much do you need?" Old Li asked casually, already taking out his wallet from his pocket.

"About thirty yuan should be enough," I said, finding his generous gesture very endearing. So I quickly put on a smiling face and replied, stretching out my right hand with three fingers extended.

"Thirty yuan? Here you go!" He pulled out three ten-yuan bills and stuffed them into my hand.

"I appreciate your trouble, Brother Li!" I took the money and hid it, and immediately said to him, "I'll definitely pay it back on the first of next month!"

"No, no, no, Old Sun! Is thirty yuan worth making such a fuss? You're looking down on me too much. If you really plan to pay it back, then I won't give it to you!"

"How can that be? That... that... I'd really be too sorry..."

"Don't say so much! Just take it and use it. Oh, I still have to go to the Venus dance hall!" he said nonchalantly, took out a large wad of banknotes from his wallet, counted them, looked at his watch, and put on his coat.

"Okay, then thank you, thank you, I'm also going home!" I knew how to seize the opportunity.

"What's there to thank! Let's go together! Today, I still have to buy five hundred yuan worth of dance tickets to support my Lily!" He gave me another cigarette, and we walked out of his house together.

On the street, we parted ways. He jumped into a rickshaw, said "goodbye," and left. I, with a sense of victory, walked quickly home.

In this way, I wrote off that difficult situation—the manager's birthday. But my heart was still troubled... Old Li, although a good person, is still not saying the right things.

Time passed quickly. A month and a half later, I suddenly received a letter. After opening it and reading it once, I couldn't help but be stunned for a long time. The letter was indeed written by Old Li, but the content was as follows:—

Dear Brother Jieren:

It has been a month since we last met, and I have been thinking of you. The last time I met you, I was one person, but now I am another! Alas! It is painful to say. Recently, I have suffered a terrible defeat in speculation, and the price of the goods I hoarded has also plummeted. The severity of this blow has caused me to be heavily in debt in addition to being bankrupt. My life has become difficult these days. I remember that you borrowed 30 yuan from me last time. Could you please return it immediately, and within the possible range, please give me dozens of yuan more to save me from my urgent need? I hope you understand my difficulties and agree to my request, and my gratitude will be immense.

Please accept my

Best regards, Your Brother Li ××

"Alas! Alas! It is true that the sky has unpredictable storms, and people have... people have what? I can't remember, but isn't this right? I said long ago that this "hoarding" ah, "hoarding" will not end well! And my thirty yuan has finally been a joy in vain? Alas! Alas!" I sighed, thinking that I could only get out that "only" suit again, add another cloth robe, and take them together to the pawnshop I was familiar with.

### Leaping Through the Air

— Yongyun

The motorcycle in the picture leaping through the air is not a trick of the camera, but a real shot. The performer of this amazing feat is a member of the British Army Signal Corps. He leaps over two people and two horses in one jump. The rider himself is not in much danger, but if he is not careful and falls suddenly in mid-air, the people and horses lying on the ground will be unlucky.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fourteen A Hero's Life

"Fourth Brother, I'm sorry, please take care of me!..." "Boss Wang, it's my fault, please don't be angry!..." Every night, Begonia almost always had to apologize to everyone and admit that he was wrong. Sometimes, he had to save his snack money for three or four days to buy some cakes and cigarettes to share with his colleagues, in order to express his gratitude.

However, these people can only do not to push him around, and beyond that, they can't help him!

In the blink of an eye, Sunday came again. On Sundays, theaters usually have both day and night performances. Although the old plays are performed during the day, the martial arts scenes are not as intense as the main plays. However, unfortunately, in this Red Stage, in addition to the main martial arts actor, there are also three or four very famous martial arts actors. Therefore, on the days when old plays are performed, there are at least three or four martial arts scenes. If a major play such as "Taking Gaodeng" or "Evil Tiger Village" is added in the middle, the martial arts actors will be exhausted.

"Boss Zhang, I want to ask you for a favor today!" During the intermission of the daytime performance, Begonia went to Zhang Yincai alone and said carefully, "When I was singing Sijie Village just now, I felt a little dizzy. Can I ask for a day off tonight and go back to rest?"

Zhang Yincai's pair of goldfish eyes first swept across his face. (267)

### Better Than Nothing

— Jiping

A young man held a large package of things and said excitedly to the old man on the sofa: "Grandpa, this is a beef substitute, that is a vegetable substitute, you will definitely be stronger than eating beef and vegetables. Ha, our supreme leader is so great!"

"Hmph, great, I wonder if he has invented a substitute for death to replace your father?"

### An Overview of Fog Chongqing

— Yanwen

(Note) "Fog Chongqing," also known as "Whip," is Song Zhidi's latest masterpiece. It has been performed successively in Hong Kong and other places, attracting huge crowds and receiving unanimous praise. In particular, the play's purpose is serious, and the theme is realistic. The Shanghai Drama Art Society, directed by Hong Mo, will stage it after "Peking Man."

The spur of life After the incident, the youth of North China took the road of exile. College student Sha Daqian and his wife Lin Juanyu, classmates Lao Ai and Wan Shixiu were among the exiled. In the winter of the 27th year, they arrived in Chongqing, all empty-handed, and prices rose day by day. Wan Shixiu finally became a "fortune teller" to support himself, while Juanyu, with the help of her childhood classmate Xu Man (now renamed Terry), opened a small restaurant with Zhao Su and his wife. Terry's behavior was a bit improper, and she was in love with a wealthy man named Yuan Murong, who was a director. But in order to survive, she had to ignore so much. But this matter was most opposed to Daqian.

Transition After the small restaurant opened, the business was very prosperous, earning more than 4,700 yuan in five months. But because it was too easy to make money, a dark struggle arose between them between rights and obligations. One day, Zhao Su had a misunderstanding with a customer over a small matter, which caused a great uproar. As a result, everyone was full of complaints. Murong took the opportunity to entice Daqian to stop and advised him to go to Hong Kong to be a "sitting guest," which would be easier to make money. So the small restaurant decided to close. But Juanyu, inspired by her sister Jia Di, felt that she should participate in the construction of the new China.

Return from Hong Kong Daqian returned to Chongqing after making a lot of money in Hong Kong for half a year by selling contraband goods, and he was a completely different person. Juanyu, on the other hand, was also a different person in the upsurge of work. Terry was still the same as before, and she always felt a little vague when she thought about the future. At this time, Jia Di's training period was over and she was going to the front. Terry casually said she would go with her, but Murong forced her to go. However, because Juanyu wanted to send winter clothes and donations to the front, Daqian did not allow this selfish and contradictory situation, which was obviously already present among several people.

Sick Daqian had completely changed and became accustomed to a luxurious life. He also contracted syphilis. Juanyu was also infected. Lao Ai's lung disease was exacerbated by excessive stimulation. After he became seriously ill, he regretfully said: "Everyone chose the easy path during difficult times. This result is inevitable." Murong showed diligence after Juanyu was stimulated. At this time, he entrusted Shixiu to bring her a savings account of 350,000 Hong Kong dollars and a plane ticket to Hong Kong, hoping to go to Hong Kong together. Unable to resist Shixiu's persuasion, Juanyu finally agreed to go to Hong Kong for medical treatment.

Two roads "Why did Juanyu go to Hong Kong?" This was another conspiracy of Murong. As a result, Juanyu returned the savings account to Terry and resolutely left. Murong later wanted to use the same trick again, but at this time Daqian and Terry both repented that they should not have been fooled by Murong, and in view of the fact that Shixiu was expelled from the country for not having a proper job, Lao Ai died of illness in the hospital, and Jia Di angrily went to the front again, they regretted that they had taken the wrong path, as Lao Ai said, and felt that young people like Jia Di had unlimited prospects in extraordinary times.

It has been scheduled to be performed on Saturday night this week.

### Blood Rain and Precious Flowers

Chapter 19 The City is Filled with Dusk Hordes

Chen Fei, of course, was also willing to work hard to kill the thieves. The two led more than a hundred iron riders, flew gracefully from the formation to the front of the formation, and charged straight into Li Chuang's formation. Li Chuang did not care that a small number of Ming soldiers were fighting in the front, so he ordered the thief generals Yizhi Tao and Ma Feitian to meet the enemy. Zhang Cangqiu wore a battle helmet, a white robe and white armor, a Lingbao treasured saber on his waist, but he held a three-pointed double-edged knife in his hand, also tied with white tassels. The sword light was like snow, setting off his dark face, which was truly black and white. Chen Fei also carried a pair of mandarin duck copper hammers. He saw a group of soldiers in the opposite bandit formation carrying two thief generals to fight. Zhang Cangqiu urged his mount, shouted loudly, waved the three-pointed double-edged knife in his hand, and charged forward first. The thief general Yizhi Tao waved his spear to meet him. He saw Zhang Cangqiu's knife light hovering over Yizhi Tao's head a few times, and Yizhi Tao's head was already gone. When Ma Feitian raised his knife to save him, Chen Fei rushed forward, blocked the knife with his left hammer, and used a bottom-of-the-leaf peach theft with his right hammer, hitting Ma Feitian's waist, and he fell face up, rolling off the saddle. Ma Feitian had a brother named Feihai, who was also in the formation. Seeing his brother being knocked off his horse, he was shocked, and without waiting for Li Chuang to order, he waved his spear and rode forward to avenge him. Zhang Cangqiu went forward to fight him again. In less than seven or eight rounds, he was cut off his horse with one knife. Zhang Chen and one general killed three thieves in a row on the formation. Li Zicheng was secretly shocked. Liu Zongmin had fully recovered from his injuries and saw it in the formation, and was furious. He said to Li Chuang, "This person is a brave man under Wu Sangui. In the previous battle of He, he suffered a loss from him. Today, he must avenge him and avenge his shame." (223)
