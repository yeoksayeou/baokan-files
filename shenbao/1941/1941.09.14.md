### US Defense Zone Scope Includes All Oceans, President's Speech is Practically a Limited Declaration of War, 300 Warships Commence Search and Fire

Washington, 13th (Associated Press) - Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that Germany's actions will determine the actual scope of US naval operations. Hull also stated that the area in which the US Navy operates will include any location deemed a threat to the security of the Western Hemisphere. Germany's actions will inevitably determine how much the US Navy will expand its patrol range. He further stated that the Axis powers are currently attempting to conquer land and sea by force as quickly and effectively as possible. Hull generally agreed with a reporter's observation that there were no directly established so-called blockade zones or self-defense zones between the US and Germany. He also stated that the current situation is the result of numerous speeches and announcements and contains no specific phrases regarding defense zones. Hull said that the general public is now paying attention to the US attempt to establish a defense base in Labrador, but he did not elaborate on this matter. Hull further stated that there was no need to notify the German government of President Roosevelt's speech.

Washington, 13th (Reuters) - Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that Germany's behavior would determine what areas of the ocean the US considers defensive, and within which areas US ships could fire first. When a reporter asked him to define "defensive ocean," Hull replied, "We must not forget that the United States is currently facing a worldwide violent action aimed at conquering all continents and oceans. This resistance will necessarily express what ocean areas the United States can deem must be defended in order to protect the Western Hemisphere." The reporter then asked if the United States would formally send a note to Germany protesting the attacks on American ships. Hull replied, "Please refer to the President's speech."

Washington, 13th (International News Service) - Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference today, releasing Roosevelt's declaration, that the President recently announced US policy, stating that US ships have been ordered to fire first if they encounter Axis submarines or other warships. This statement by the President applies not only to the American side of the Atlantic, but also to all parts of the seven seas where German and Italian warships threaten American interests. However, when explaining the all-inclusive "fire first" order, Hull, like President Roosevelt, did not mention Japan or Japanese warships. Foreign diplomatic circles here generally believe that the President's recent actions constitute a de facto declaration of war by the United States in the Atlantic. It is reported that the US Navy has already received new orders to set out on patrol to implement the "fire first" declaration. Officials say the next step, regarding the issue of war and peace between Hitler and the United States, now depends on Hitler.

New York, 13th (Reuters) - A dispatch from Washington elaborates on Hull's remarks to reporters yesterday regarding the "fire first" order, saying that while Hull's words were obscure, their meaning was clear: it was a warning to Berlin that if a ship flying the American flag is attacked anywhere on Earth, there will be a possibility of American retaliation. In practical terms, Hull's remarks have made all navigable oceans in the world part of the US defense zone.

Washington, 13th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. Early, told reporters yesterday that President Roosevelt's clear speech was the only definition of the areas within which the US can fire first. After the speech was broadcast, the White House received a total of 1,600 telegrams, all but 150 of which supported the President's position. According to radio station surveys, the broadcast had a very large audience, estimated at 80 million people, accounting for 67% of the listening audience, only 3% less than when the President announced an unlimited state of emergency in early summer. Therefore, this can be said to be the second-largest audience in American listening history. When asked about the President's statement that ships of Britain and other friendly nations on legitimate voyages will be protected by US ships within the American defense zone, Mr. Early replied that everyone knows the meaning of "protection," even a schoolchild with a slight knowledge of English knows it.

New York, 13th (Reuters) - A dispatch from the New York Sun in Washington states that the US President's speech is seen by the world as almost a limited declaration of war. What Hitler's response will be is what people in Washington were waiting for yesterday.

Washington, 13th (Associated Press) - The US Navy's Atlantic Patrol Force yesterday conducted its first test of its "fire first" search, to search for the submarine that sank the freighter Montana in the North Atlantic. Army units have been cooperating with the Navy from their bases in Iceland, but the majority of the responsibility for defending the area will be borne by the Atlantic Fleet. In the past June, the Atlantic Fleet received a large increase in defenses from the Pacific. The area may still need to be further fortified.

Washington, 12th - International affairs commentators expressed their opinions tonight, believing that the American people and Congress will support any future actions by the President, because society and sentiment have responded to the President's actions better and faster than they have to his speeches. Leading members of Congress generally agreed with the President's speech and unanimously considered the speech to be tantamount to a declaration of war. Senator Connally said that he hopes the US Navy will fire fiercely and resolutely deal with attacking ships. Editorials in major newspapers all supported the policy announced by the President, urging the government to continue taking strong measures and calling on the American people to support the President.

London, 13th (Associated Press) - The London Evening News predicted yesterday that as a result of President Roosevelt's speech on freedom of the seas, Germany will be forced to back down, allowing American raw materials to flow across the Atlantic, or face a shooting war with the United States. The Standard Evening News published a dispatch from Washington, reporting that 300 American warships have begun searching for German raiders in the Atlantic. The newspaper said that the second decision is in Hitler's hands. He has encountered the greatest hesitation in the war so far. If he does not withdraw from the waters west of Iceland, he will invite a shooting war with the United States. But regardless of what he does, he has suffered a major defeat today. British officials say that there is no doubt that President Roosevelt has obtained the powers of commander-in-chief of the US Army and Navy. In addition, it is clear that US ships and aircraft will seek out and destroy every German ship found in the self-defense zone.

London, 13th (International News Service) - British authorities commenting on President Roosevelt's speech said that Mr. Roosevelt has drawn a line in the center of the Atlantic Ocean. The United States has now assumed responsibility for protecting all ships west of Iceland in the Atlantic, while Britain is responsible for those to the east. It is widely believed that if Germany tries to undermine the security of the western sea lanes, it will risk "war" with the United States. British Prime Minister Churchill will soon issue a formal statement on Roosevelt's speech on behalf of the British government.

Moscow, 13th (Associated Press) - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhailovsky said yesterday that President Roosevelt's speech on freedom of the seas has dealt Germany the most serious blow, and not only in its political significance.

### German Official Statement

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) - German officials strongly condemned President Roosevelt for fabricating facts in his speech, deliberately placing the United States in the position of defender in order to wage war against the Axis powers. His claim that four American ships and one Panamanian ship had been attacked is completely untrue. He now openly admits that he has ordered the US fleet to attack any Axis ships when necessary. This move will force Germany to take all necessary steps. Mr. Roosevelt, in his speech yesterday, made it clear to the world that US President Roosevelt should bear full responsibility for all consequences. The German Foreign Ministry continued, "Roosevelt is the mastermind behind this European war. Various documents that have been published show what kind of activities he and his followers participated in for two years before and after the outbreak of the war. He intended to cause the outbreak of the European war when he supported Czechoslovakia. He and his special envoy to Belgrade, Colonel Donovan, also tried every possible means to bring Yugoslavia into the war. He also tried to force defeated France to continue its anti-German war with a policy of starvation blockade. The Anglo-Soviet alliance was also created by him. He is a war maniac who wants to blur the feelings of the American people in order to send them to the front lines. But when the American people taste the pain of war and realize it, it will be too late to regret it." Berlin officials continued, "Roosevelt's policy fully reflects the style of a representative of the Communist Jewish race. The reason is none other than that the Jewish race has already been eliminated in this war. We still remember that when he was running for president, he repeatedly stated that he would not involve the United States in the vortex of war, but today none of his policies fail to draw the American people into the disaster of war, becoming cannon fodder to maintain the interests of Britain and the Jews. The purpose of this speech is nothing more than to make the American people believe that he is standing in the position of defender, so he is forced to take steps to protect American interests. These several events were all created by him in order to provide an excuse for joining the war." The German Foreign Ministry believes that Roosevelt's explanation of the Greer incident is completely inconsistent with the facts and has been proven by previously published German communiques. As for the second incident, in which an American warship was chased by a German submarine, the German government has never heard of it. Regarding the Robin Moor incident mentioned by Roosevelt, the treatment of the ship and its crew was entirely in accordance with universally recognized laws of war and there was nothing illegal about it. As for the Steel Seafarer incident, since Germany and Italy had clearly announced a combat zone in advance, and according to the statement issued by the United States, the ship was also carrying munitions, but the ship still rashly entered the combat zone, so it is difficult to blame others for its misfortune. As for whether there were American ships among the ships sunk in the Suez Canal area, the German side could not be sure because the attacks took place at night. As for the Sessa, since it was flying the Panamanian flag, the US President has no right to inquire about its loss. In short, President Roosevelt's entire speech is completely arbitrary and disregards the facts in its main parts. Its purpose is clearly to show that such events are all planned actions by Germany against American warships and merchant ships. The order issued by the US President to shoot Axis ships, judging from the previous speech by US Secretary of the Navy Knox, has already taken effect months ago, but Mr. Roosevelt thought that the time was not yet ripe and did not dare to admit it clearly. Now he thinks the time has come. The people of the world know that the Axis powers have no aggressive ambitions, so Mr. Roosevelt has to fabricate facts." A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry solemnly stated in conclusion that after the US fleet receives the order to shoot Axis ships, it will force Germany to take all necessary steps. The consequences resulting from this should be borne by President Roosevelt.

Rome, 12th (Havas News Agency) - Responsible parties recently commented that President Roosevelt's broadcast speech is completely contrary to American neutrality. So far, the United States has not formally abandoned its neutrality in legal terms. As for Roosevelt's decision to occupy military strategic points outside American territorial waters and beyond its interests, it is also completely contrary to the Monroe Doctrine championed by the United States. Roosevelt is using some accidental events to order the fleet to shoot all ships of the Axis countries. His desire to make a mountain out of a molehill is very obvious. His purpose is to promote American participation in the war. The so-called freedom of the seas has little meaning and only wants to maintain the maritime hegemony of the Anglo-Saxons.

### Active Trading on the New York Stock Market

New York, 12th (Associated Press) - Market analysts continued to express their belief today that the stock market is trending upward, but experts believe that the current situation is a market full of stocks, not a stock market. Experts' words mean that stock trading is currently selective buying and selling. Wall Street believes that President Roosevelt's speech is constructive for the stock market. The market opened stably and trading was active. Cotton advanced 13 to 20 points. Prices fluctuated slightly at the close, but all made progress because the market believes that President Roosevelt's speech is favorable. Wall Street believes that the President's remarks have clarified the ambiguous status of US transport on the high seas. It also believes that the President's failure to mention Japan is enough to indicate that the government hopes to reach a satisfactory resolution on US-Japan differences. Bonds fluctuated today. Chicago grains closed slightly lower.

### US Policy Toward the Far East Has Not Changed in Five Years, Considers Talk of Compromise With Japan Strange

Washington, 13th (Reuters) - The optimism expressed in dispatches from Shanghai and Tokyo, believing that US-Japan relations are now gradually entering a stage of close friendship, replacing the increasing tension of the past fifteen months, has not been seen as having a basis in Washington. As far as informed sources know, the US position has not changed. It is reported that Japan now understands that Japan must first provide genuine and concrete evidence of a change in mindset and sincerity before practical talks can be held to eliminate the current tension between the two countries. According to opinions here, Washington cannot be convinced of Japan's sincerity in improving relations with the United States unless Japan withdraws from the Axis. This does not mean that the United States is willing to make concessions or lift the recent economic sanctions imposed on Japan in exchange for Japan's withdrawal from the Axis. Some quarters believe that US authorities hold a sense that certain important gestures, such as withdrawing from the Axis, are necessary to ensure that the US government has assurance that Japan truly wants to improve US-Japan relations. As for speculations that if Japan makes such a gesture, a policy of appeasement will be adopted or China will be sold out, there is no evidence here to indicate this. In fact, US policy toward the Far East has not changed to this day and is still based on the declaration issued by the United States after Japan's invasion of China in 1937. In other words, while Japan is trapped in the quagmire of war against China, it rashly led to a predicament of almost going to war with Britain and the United States. Now, if it wishes to get out of this predicament, withdrawing from the Axis is only the first step. The news coming from Shanghai, which seems to say that the US and Japan are about to reach a large-scale compromise, is considered strange here. However, the optimism of the Japanese transmitted from Tokyo and the news that Japanese newspapers are temporarily not criticizing the United States have aroused interest, and particular attention is being paid to the privately transmitted saying that even the pro-war factions and military cliques in Tokyo are now feeling panic and are thinking of withdrawing from the Axis in order to avoid the continued deterioration of relations with the United States.

Tokyo, 12th (Havas News Agency) - According to informed sources, US-Japanese negotiations have reached a preliminary agreement last week, the contents of which are expected to be released within days. However, the form in which it will be released is unknown. What can be known is that this agreement should declare that the US and Japan agree to handle relations between the two countries in accordance with various basic principles. As for the solution to various pending cases, it is not involved. In essence, this agreement is intended to stipulate that the two countries guarantee not to resort to arms in the future and should find ways to peacefully resolve various political issues between them in order to gradually restore normal economic and financial relations.

### Chinese Officials and People Adhere to Their Position

Chongqing, 13th (Reuters) - Although most Chinese here do not fully believe the rumors that the terms of a US-Japan agreement have been decided as a result of discussions in Washington, a sense of anxiety is gradually growing. It is widely believed that these talks may have progressed beyond the "probing stage." All Chinese leaders believe that the above-mentioned rumors that the terms of the agreement have been decided may have been spread by the Japanese side. Although they are by no means the final conditions of a settlement, they may more or less represent the Japanese side's proposals. They do not believe that the United States will sacrifice China to appease Japan without consulting China and immediately accept the final settlement conditions, or accept conditions that it knows China cannot allow. Chinese officials and the public all insist that China will continue to resist as long as Japanese troops do not withdraw from Chinese territory. According to reliable Chinese sources received here from Washington, the United States is eager to reach a compromise with Japan in order to devote its full strength to dealing with developments in the Atlantic. However, some Chinese people do not believe that the United States' position in the Atlantic will make it necessary for it to appease Japan, because the United States does not need to use its main naval force to deal with German raiders and warships in the Atlantic.

Vichy, 13th (Haitong News Agency) - Diplomatic circles believe that US Ambassador to France Admiral Leahy's meeting with French Head of State Pétain yesterday is directly related to the meeting between Japanese Ambassador Kato and French Deputy Premier Darlan. It is reported that Leahy informed Pétain that clashes between the US and Japan in the Far East are inevitable. It is said that Leahy discussed the issue of Vietnam with Pétain and informed Pétain that if Japan increases its garrison in Vietnam, Britain and the United States will be forced to take certain countermeasures.

### NAKANO’s Speech Has Two Intents

Tokyo, 13th (Reuters) - Seigo Nakano, leader of the only revival party in Japan, the Oriental Society, gave a speech here this afternoon in response to British Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt. Thousands of Tokyo citizens listened, and thousands more stood outside the lecture hall, listening through loudspeakers. Nakano predicted that the US-Japan war will break out soon. He did not have much faith in the opportunity for a settlement between Britain, the United States, and Japan, and said that if negotiations fail, Japan is prepared to fight to the last man. Nakano also warned in his speech, which was not officially authorized but must have been approved, not to prolong the Washington talks, lest Japan lose the opportunity to advance south. Nakano continued, oil is the urgently needed blood for Japan in transfusions, and warned that the time may come when this blood cannot be obtained. At that time, our planes will all be parked on the ground and unable to rise. The United States is now solely occupied with assisting Britain, so fighting with Japan will be "meaningless". If Japan sends its 500 warships and 4,000 aircraft to the South Pacific to threaten Singapore, Manila, and Australia, Britain and the United States will be difficult to deal with. Therefore, he urged the Axis countries to take the offensive via the Caucasus and the Persian Gulf and meet with Japan in Singapore. Most of the evening newspapers did not publish this speech in a prominent position. Only the Sino-Foreign Business News was published on the front page. It was not mentioned in the scheduled news program of TOAK Radio. Foreign observers in Tokyo all believe that Nakano's speech had only two intentions: (1) to test the public's mood towards the US-Japan situation, (2) to urge the United States to quickly comply with Japan's proposals. Among the morning newspapers, only the Kokumin Shinbun published this speech on the front page, saying that the purpose of this speech was probably aimed specifically at foreigners. Although the general public only considered Nakano's speech to be an opinion expressed by a powerful and minority party leader and did not pay much attention to it, in today's tense situation when others are trying to be cautious and silent, expressing such bold remarks is not without considerable significance. At the same time, general pessimism is now growing again.

### Continued Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet

Tokyo, 13th (Associated Press) - The Cabinet continued its rapid reorganization yesterday. Observers believe that the purpose of this move is to respond to the German-Soviet war and to deal with "changes in the world situation" in order to satisfy public antipathy. Officials said, "The aim of the Army Department's transfer is to ensure close cooperation between the Army Chief and Tokyo policy in order to be more loyal to the Emperor." Observers also said that even right-wing figures can cooperate with any new Konoe policy, and right-wing leaders are currently in the hands of conservative elements.

### Philippine Journalist Romulo Arrives in Chongqing From Hong Kong

Chongqing - Philippine newspaper giant Carlos P. Romulo arrived in Hong Kong from Manila the day before yesterday and arrived in Chongqing this morning. After a short rest, he went to the Executive Yuan to meet with Secretary-General Jiang Tingfu. Mr. Romulo will stay in Chongqing for four or five days and plans to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Romulo had visited Chiang the day before the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, and was the first foreign reporter to learn that China was determined to resist if Japan challenged it, and reported this to the United States accurately. In addition, Mr. Romulo will also visit government authorities and leaders from all walks of life, and then collect reports from Kunming, Yangon, Singapore, Batavia, and other places.

Editorial

### From the Atlantic Situation to Sino-Japanese Relations

Since the 7th of last month, there have been no fewer than five or six instances of American ships being deliberately attacked by German submarines and aircraft. Apart from two American warships that escaped damage despite being attacked, three merchant ships flying the American flag have been sunk. The latest, the "Montana," was attacked just hours after President Roosevelt delivered a tough speech announcing a "shoot on sight" policy. It is not difficult to imagine that German ships and aircraft will intensify their attacks on American ships in all seas from now on, while the American naval and air forces will also intensify their search and strike back hard, following the President's orders. Under these circumstances, the tense situation in the Atlantic naturally contains a major crisis that could erupt at any moment. Although the United States may not immediately declare war on Germany, the extreme seriousness of the situation is an undeniable fact.

The deterioration of U.S.-German relations has not been a matter of a day or two. How it will evolve in the future is as clear as watching a fire, and it seems unnecessary to speculate further. What is worth examining is why Germany, not sooner or later, suddenly changed its strategy of avoiding provoking the United States since the beginning of the war, especially at a time when rumors were rife that the U.S. and Japan were about to reach a compromise, and openly attacked its ships while admitting it without hesitation, as if it had decided to force the United States to join the war. Generally speaking, the change in Germany's attitude toward the United States may be due to the following reasons: First, the Nazi war against the Soviet Union has been prolonged and must be dragged through the winter. In view of Britain's recent advances in Africa and the Near East, and the small-scale offensive by the British-Canadian joint forces in northern Norway a few days ago, Hitler seems to be worried that if Britain launches a counter-offensive early, the Axis powers will be attacked from both sides. Therefore, he would rather risk offending the United States and is determined to do everything possible to prevent Britain from receiving supplies from across the Atlantic. Second, Hitler knows that sooner or later he will break with the United States. Rather than waiting for the Roosevelt government to use its vast material and human resources to complete the entire national defense program, it is better to force it to join the war early. Moreover, at a time when there is no concrete achievement in the U.S.-Japan negotiations, inviting the United States to join the war can at least force Roosevelt not to transfer all the naval and air forces in the Pacific to the Atlantic to fight against Germany. Third, the ongoing U.S.-Japan negotiations, no matter to what extent the two sides can reach a compromise, are more or less unfavorable to Germany. Assuming that Japan really abandons the Axis powers in the future and joins the embrace of Britain and the United States, it would be almost a fatal blow to Hitler's already considerably shaken prestige. Therefore, he must "win by surprise" and make a gesture of breaking with the United States in order to "hold on" to Japan and encourage Japan not to abandon the policy of "taking advantage of the Axis's momentum to establish hegemony in the Pacific." At the very least, Hitler hopes to "threaten the United States in the Atlantic" to raise Japan's bargaining position in negotiations with the United States, so that the isolated Tokyo government will not accept the conditions of Britain and the United States one hundred percent. This is not only a very subtle "bitter trick," but also a "reassurance pill" to comfort a group of pro-German elements in Japan. Because after the German-Soviet war, the public opinion in Japan complaining about the Tripartite Pact and the sentiment of doubting whether the Axis powers can win have indeed gradually risen. Hitler knows that if there is no practical action to convince Japan at this time, he will lose this "more than failing, failing more" Eastern ally.

Based on the above, it can be seen that Germany's repeated attacks on American ships in the Atlantic and the Red Sea are indeed related to the long-running U.S.-Japan negotiations, although the U.S.-Japan negotiations themselves, as of now, are still confusing and difficult to grasp what stage they have reached. Tokyo's propaganda says that the progress is smooth, that is, the two sides have reached an agreement in principle, but the fact that President Roosevelt did not mention a word in his speech the next day shows that the claim of reaching an agreement is absolutely unreliable. Moreover, the Japanese side claimed to have reached an agreement at the end of last week (September 6), but Secretary of State Hull said on Thursday of this week (September 12) that the U.S.-Japan talks "have not had any new developments." Given the frank and fair attitude of Roosevelt and Hull in normal times, there is no reason why the negotiations were completed a week ago, but they are still concealing it. Although President Roosevelt sternly condemned Germany yesterday, he did not criticize Japan at the same time like British Prime Minister Churchill, which seems to contain some consideration for Japan. But on the one hand, this may be the "courtesy" that a head of state should have when the two sides' talks are in progress, and on the other hand, the sole object of yesterday's speech was to respond to Germany's piratical behavior, and not to discuss the general international situation. He did not mention a word about the Soviet war, which is clear evidence. Therefore, regarding what progress has been made in the U.S.-Japan talks recently, the world may as well wait for the official explanation from the Washington authorities under the belief that the United States will never abandon the eight principles and will never change its anti-aggression policy, and there is no need to be disturbed by some rumors. It should be known that no matter what new developments there are in U.S.-Japan relations, the essence of which remains unchanged. At least one fact has been determined and unshakeable, that is, the comprehensive strength of the democratic group in the Far East will inevitably become stronger and stronger in the future. Therefore, no matter what, it must be entirely beneficial and harmless to China, which upholds justice.

### Song Ziwen Represents Chairman Chiang at a Banquet to Bid Farewell to the U.S. Military Delegation. China's Operations are Not Without Benefit to the United States. The Two Countries Will Surely Cooperate to Guarantee Peace in the Pacific. The Delegation is Requesting Instructions from the Government to Come to China in the Short Term.

Washington – Song Ziwen, representing Chairman Chiang, hosted a banquet tonight at the Shoreham Hotel to bid farewell to members of the U.S. military delegation to China and its leader, Major General Magruder. The delegation is currently making final requests for instructions from the government in order to go to China in the short term. Mr. Song, on behalf of Chairman Chiang, expressed his welcome to the delegation's visit to China, saying roughly: It is not the first time that a foreign military delegation has visited China. In 1925, the Soviet military delegation visited China, and a few years later, Germany also sent a military delegation to China. The delegations of the Soviet Union and Germany have made considerable contributions to China's national defense. The Chinese people's firm and unshakable belief in friendship with the United States exceeds their belief in friendship with any other country. It is not strange for your people to help our country, and it is an honor for your country. Secondly, when our national father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, founded the Republic of China, he took the United States of America as an example. Today, our country still needs to review the ways and steps to establish democracy from your country. Now the democratic foundation of our country has been established, because the people of our country originally have a democratic consciousness in their nature. No matter how humble the people of our country are, they must have an innate sense of self-esteem. Anyone who resides in our country can understand this point. Self-esteem originates from a belief that everyone is in an equal position. This is exactly the opposite of the Japanese, whose aggressive nature is enough to reflect their inferiority complex. Third, we often hear in our spare time (the United States and China on the other side of the Pacific should join hands), but in fact, our country's more than four years of resolute anti-aggression struggle is not without value to your country, which is well known by all parties. In the past, our country was generally imagined as an old and defenseless country. We are witnessing the production of a great country that loves peace, seeks peace, and defends its interests with force. I firmly believe that the future era will surely witness China and the United States adopting cooperation in a very harmonious way to jointly guarantee the peaceful development of the Pacific region. I respectfully hope that after your hard work in our country in the future, you will be able to truly understand the above points, as an encouragement to you and make you feel comforted.

### A Chinese Military Officer Talks About the Process of Recapturing Fuzhou. The Chinese Army Fought Heroically with the Determination to Avenge its Shame. It Gained the Assistance of People from All Over and Achieved Initial Success.

Shangrao - Fuzhou City is the second provincial capital recovered by the Chinese army after Nanning City. The county town is good news after the war has entered its fifth year, which is enough to make the people of the country happy and encouraged. In order to understand the details of the battle, the reporter went to a certain place to visit the military officer in charge, who answered as follows:

Motivation for Counterattack

(1) Question: What was the motivation of the Chinese army to capture Fuzhou and what was the military situation before the launch? Answer: The Chinese army was determined to recover Fuzhou in order to relieve the people from their plight. Moreover, Fuzhou is isolated in terms of terrain, and the Japanese soldiers are not sufficiently allocated in terms of equipment. After the Chinese military command decided to recover Fuzhou, it made preparations in advance. On the 1st of this month, it launched a real attack. The main force of the Chinese army was controlled in the front of Fuzhou, waiting for an opportunity to move. The two wings attacked from Fuqing, Changle, and Lianjiang, Guantou, respectively, to control Fuzhou City and cut off the north-south sea lanes at the mouth of the Minjiang River. When the attacks on the two wings of the Chinese army were effective, the rear of the Japanese army in Fuzhou felt threatened. Therefore, the main force on the front took advantage of the situation to launch a surprise attack.

Overview of the Bloody Battle

(2) Question: How did the Chinese army win a complete victory in recovering Fuzhou, what were the details of the battle? Answer: After the Chinese army decided to recover Fuzhou, all three routes began to move. The target of the Chinese army on the right bank of the Minjiang River was Fuqing City. After dusk on August 25, they attacked the North Gate and Haikou of Fuqing in separate directions. Before dawn on the 26th, they captured Fuqing City. The Japanese army retreated to Haikou. On the evening of the 27th, more than a thousand Japanese reinforcements from Haikou launched a fierce counterattack under the cover of Japanese aircraft. Fuqing was captured by the Japanese again. On September 1, the Chinese army launched another attack and added its main force. The morale was high and unstoppable. The Japanese army was unable to support and fled. The Chinese army recaptured Fuqing City on the 2nd and pursued and defeated the Japanese army. In the evening, they captured Haikou again. The Japanese army escaped by boat from Haikou. Another part of the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to advance and recover Changle City. Thus, the Japanese army on the right bank of the Minjiang River was wiped out. On the left bank of the Minjiang River, Lianjiang, the Chinese army's attacking troops attacked Sangang Mishi on the evening of August 25, and a part attacked Pandu. That night, they occupied Sangang. Then the Japanese army reinforced with hundreds of counterattacks. The Chinese army retreated to the vicinity of Pukou and Mupu, and turned to attack Lianjiang. On the morning of the 26th, they occupied Yuntai Mountain. The Japanese army felt embarrassed and used fierce artillery fire to prevent the Chinese army from advancing. In order to contain and lure the Japanese army, the Chinese army transferred to the vicinity of Xiayang via Pukou on the 30th and continued to make small-scale contact with the Japanese army in Pandu. On September 1, the real attack of the Chinese army began. The main force joined the battle and attacked Lianjiang. A part attacked Pandu from Liaoyang and advanced. After a fierce battle with the Japanese army, they occupied Pandu. They continued to attack Tangling Jianghu and took advantage of the victory to attack Lianjiang City. The Japanese army retreated to Zhongyan Mountain and Jiangnan Bridge in separate directions. Then seven or eight hundred Japanese troops from Guantou, with many artillery pieces, reinforced Jiangnan Bridge and launched a counterattack against the Chinese army under the cover of aircraft, trying to maintain this important rear base. The battle was fierce. The Japanese army re-offended Lianjiang City. That night, the Chinese army's reserve team joined the battle. The morale was greatly boosted and they attacked Lianjiang City again. After a fierce battle, they finally recaptured Lianjiang City on the morning of the 3rd and captured several Japanese artillery pieces and many other war trophies. The Chinese army also pursued and occupied the important point of Guantou. The north road of the Minjiang River, which went to sea from Fuzhou, was controlled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army escaped by boat from Changmen. On the Fuzhou side, a part of the Chinese army advanced from Baishaguan Yuanli on the evening of the 25th, occupied Nanxi Mountain on the morning of the 26th, and occupied the line of Shijiaoshan Dabao Peak on the morning of the 27th. They continued to force the Japanese army's positions in Dalanshan and Tongcen. On the 29th, they secretly advanced a part of the main force to await the good news of the Chinese army's attack on Fuqing and Lianjiang, and then pushed forward with all their strength to Fuzhou. They once raided Centou at night, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. After the 30th, Japanese aircraft dispatched to stop the Chinese army's attack, but it seemed that the main force in this area was not discovered by the Japanese army. They sneaked into Fuzhou City and the areas near Nantai on the same day. With the help of the people, they actively disrupted and destroyed the Japanese army. The Japanese army hurriedly transferred the Qingchuan Brigade of the Marine Corps to Fuzhou via Nantai for reinforcement. At dawn on the 1st, the Chinese army secretly prepared the brave main force for three or four days and suddenly attacked Tongkou and Bijia Mountain, the important points on the outer edge of Fuzhou. This line was the main defense line of the Japanese army. The battle was fierce. On the morning of the 2nd, another part of the Chinese army joined the battle and finally defeated the Japanese army. They captured Tongkou on the night of the 2nd and occupied Nainaiping, Hudingshan, and Centou on the morning of the 3rd. By this time, the main defense line of the Japanese army entrenched in Fuzhou had fallen into the hands of the Chinese army. The attacks by the Chinese army in Fuqing, Changle, and Lianjiang were also very successful. The rear situation of the Japanese army was quite critical. The Japanese army in Fuzhou was showing signs of wavering. The Chinese attacking troops took advantage of the situation to step up their attack. The South Road captured Hongshan Bridge, turned around and advanced, and rushed into Jiangbianjiao via Hongshan Bridge, Fuzhou Nantai, and Dujia Island. The North Road Chinese army quickly pursued the main force of the Japanese army from Beitou, Xiaodian, and Fuzhou to Mawei. A part surrounded and attacked Fuzhou City. Under the Chinese army's pincer attack, the Japanese army lost its advance and retreat and retreated one after another. At 8 am on the morning of the 3rd, the Chinese army officially recovered Fuzhou City and occupied Nantai outside the city at 10 am. The Japanese army, covering the retreating troops, entrenched themselves in the Gulingshan area to resist. The Chinese army, with the remaining power of victory, fought fiercely for a day. The Japanese army on Gulingshan retreated to Mawei until the evening. The Chinese army's pursuing troops tracked and searched, and completely wiped out the Japanese army in Mawei on the morning of the 4th. In this battle, the competition for Fuqing, Lianjiang, and Tongkou was fierce, and the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties.

Reasons for Victory

(3) Question: What are the reasons for the Chinese army's victory? Answer: (1) The Japanese army was entrenched in Fuzhou and its situation was isolated. Because after the Japanese army occupied Fuzhou, it was under the control of the Chinese army. The line from Fuqing Tongkou, Daxiao Beiyan to Lianjiang could not be expanded. The strength of its outer defense line was not enough to allocate. It was extremely difficult to defend it. (2) The commanders at all levels of the Chinese army were determined to capture Fuzhou, and they used the camera to cooperate. They first cut off the rear of Fuzhou, and then used the main force to launch a surprise attack, so that the Japanese army had no time to calmly deploy, so they were able to capture Fuzhou City in one fell swoop. (3) The Chinese soldiers and generals had a heart to avenge their shame and were loyal and brave. The people of Fuqing, Changle, Fuzhou, and Lianjiang went to cooperate in the action, and were able to complete the task and cut its merits. (4) The special warfare was properly coordinated. On August 31, the Chinese plainclothes team mixed into Fuzhou City, and destroyed the Japanese army's telecommunications between Fuzhou and Maxing in advance, and set fire to the rear of the Japanese army in Nantai to disrupt the attack on the main force. In short, after the Jin Xian launched an attack on August 25, in a few days, it captured more than 30 cities and strongholds that were occupied by the Japanese army, which provided favorable support for the attack on Fuzhou. The ability of the people to rise up and assist was the main reason for this success. (12th dispatch)

### 5,000 U.S. Trucks are About to Arrive on the Yunnan-Burma Road. The Truck can Carry Four Tons and Make a Six-Day Trip. No Bombing can Stop the Road's Transportation.

New York - An Erstein, a member of the Yunnan-Burma Road Inspection Committee, said yesterday after arriving here that no bombing can stop the transportation of money on the famous Free China Road. Mr. Erstein and another member, David, a U.S. truck expert, are completing a detailed inspection of the Yunnan-Burma Road. Mr. An said, "The consolidation of the Yunnan-Burma Road, even any degree of bombing, cannot stop its transportation work." He also said, "Japan can never defeat China, because they are all determined to resist, and they have unimaginable spirit." He said that he did not encounter any Japanese planes during his six-month trip on the road. Mr. An also announced that 5,000 new trucks from the Lend-Lease Act will arrive in Rangoon in a short period of time. The truck can carry four tons and make a six-day trip. (13th United Press dispatch)

London - Today's "Economist" magazine published an article titled "Lend-Lease and Tev Cooper." It argued that it is worth sacrificing to provide more Lend-Lease supplies to China, even if it reduces the supplies obtained by Britain and the Soviet Union, and that it is necessary to help China build an air force that is not very large but effective, in order to contain any southward movement by Japan. The article stated: The transportation of Lend-Lease supplies to China depends on transportation, because the amount of cargo transported on the Yunnan-Burma Road is limited, and a large number of goods are currently stored in Rangoon and have not been transported to China, which may make it difficult for the Lend-Lease program to succeed in its strategy for the Far East. However, since China provides manpower and the United States provides tools, Britain should be able to provide transportation. Because the border between China, Burma, and India is quite long, in addition to the Yunnan-Burma Road and the proposed railway starting from Lashio, it is possible to open other roads in other places, and it is acceptable to open a road from India to the north to China, which is safer. The land there is extremely rugged, but war can produce architectural miracles. The British government has accepted some of these plans in principle, but the most important thing is time. The dispatch of Tev Cooper to the Far East is enough to show that the British government appreciates the importance and urgency of this issue. In addition to transportation, Cooper has many other tasks, but among the issues in the Far East, transportation is the most important. Cooper must manage the lifeline of Asia and become the highest organizer of densely distributed shipping lines, air lines, and car road networks to contain the Japanese aggression. To carry out this major task, it requires strong ability and extremely close cooperation between China and the United States, or even the establishment of another administrative agency in Singapore, but this is also a great opportunity.

### Fierce Battles Outside Leningrad The German Army Suffers Unprecedented Losses Red Army Withdraws from Chernigov in the Kiev Region Germans Gain Foothold on East Bank of Dnieper

Reuters, Moscow, 13th - Director Rosovsky of the Soviet Information Bureau stated last night that the battle currently underway outside Leningrad is so intense as to be almost unbelievable, and that the German losses are so severe as to be unprecedented and unsustainable in the long term. The Germans' urgent desire for a quick victory has not been achieved. Not only are the Soviet army and the Baltic Fleet strongly defending Leningrad, but the residents are also participating in city work, and able-bodied men and women are all taking up arms to resist. No matter how arduous the struggle, the entire Soviet people and government are deeply convinced that the Germans will not be able to occupy Leningrad.

Reuters, London, 13th - Yesterday's communiqués from both the German and American sides were extremely simple, but the Soviet-German war has clearly entered another very important stage. The danger faced by Leningrad does not appear to have increased significantly, and the city's defenses remain a formidable obstacle for the German army to overcome. However, the Soviet forces led by General Budyonny in the south appear to be in a precarious situation. The Soviets have admitted that the Germans have gained a foothold on the east bank of the lower Dnieper River. This move by the Germans may be the start of an offensive against the Perekop Isthmus (connecting the Crimean Peninsula to the mainland). In the central sector of the front, the Soviet forces led by General Timoshenko are continuing their counter-offensive, but if the Soviet forces advance too far after recapturing Yelnya, their communications will ultimately be difficult to maintain. The current situation is unclear, and predictions of either optimism or pessimism may be wrong. So far, there is no reason to believe that the talent of the Soviet generals and the fighting spirit of the Soviet soldiers are inferior to the tactics of the Nazi mechanized army.

Reuters, London, 13th - Today, the fighting around Leningrad and Kiev is intensifying, and there are also fierce battles in other parts of the front. The Germans have intensified their attacks again, hoping to fulfill the orders of their general headquarters to capture these cities by a certain date. The Soviets have admitted that Chernigov, 80 miles northeast of Kiev, has been evacuated after fierce fighting. The German attack on the rear defenses of Kiev from the lower Dnieper River is said to have made some progress. The German daily communiqué states that the offensive is proceeding smoothly according to plan, while the Soviet communiqué only mentions that there is fighting throughout the front. The counter-offensive by General Timoshenko's forces in the Smolensk area has resumed. Berlin dispatches acknowledge that General Voroshilov's forces are also counter-attacking in certain areas 100 miles southwest of Leningrad. These Soviet forces have attacked the rear of the German forces besieging Leningrad twice. It is believed that the attacks on the German rear may be one of the reasons why the German commander-in-chief has set a deadline for the capture of Leningrad. Furthermore, according to a special communiqué from Moscow, several German icebreakers and flat-bottomed boats full of infantry are attempting to sneak along the coast towards Leningrad in the Gulf of Finland. Soviet armed icebreakers spotted them and pursued them at full speed, sinking several icebreakers and two flat-bottomed boats carrying troops. The communiqué also mentioned the fierce air battle over Leningrad on Wednesday, stating that German aircraft repeatedly attempted to raid the city but were repelled, and only a few German aircraft managed to infiltrate the city at night and drop a few bombs. Currently, all the entrances to Leningrad are defended by armored trains, mostly driven by sailors from the Baltic Fleet. Railway workers in Leningrad are now building high-speed trains to attack German-occupied stations.

### US Mission to Go to UK, USSR to Discuss Entire Aid-to-USSR Program Large Quantities of War Materials Already En Route to USSR Soviet Ambassador Oumansky to Return Home for Consultations

Reuters, Washington, 13th - After meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday, Mr. Harriman, head of the U.S. mission to the Soviet Union, stated that the U.S. mission to the Soviet Union would soon handle the issue of supplying U.S. aid, which is needed not only by the Soviet Union in the recent period, but also by all countries seeking final victory. The entire aid-to-USSR program will be discussed in Moscow with British and Soviet representatives, and there will be no time limit on this program. The Persian Gulf and Vladivostok will become important ports of entry. The U.S. mission will first go to London to meet with the British mission. When asked whether the UK would transfer a portion of its aid received from the US to the Soviet Union, Mr. Harriman replied that it would be discussed in London and Moscow, as it is a question of where aid can best contribute to the plan to defeat the enemy. War materials are already en route to the Soviet Union, and it is expected that large quantities of aid will be loaded onto ships for shipment in the coming months. The U.S. mission will have a total of 18 members, including 5 main representatives and 13 technical experts. When the mission returns to the U.S., some members will remain permanently stationed in the Soviet Union, with Colonel Faymonville, a military supply officer, as the leader of the permanent staff. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday while hosting news reporters that the United States is now doing everything possible to facilitate all assistance to the Soviet Union and will continue to do so.

Reuters, Washington, 13th - President Roosevelt yesterday met with several leaders of the Soviet technical mission to the U.S., who were introduced by Soviet Ambassador Oumansky. It is said that Mr. Oumansky will soon return to Moscow to report in detail on U.S. aid to the Soviet Union.

### Allied Economic Conference to Be Held in London

Reuters, London, 13th - The date for the Allied economic conference in London is expected to be announced soon.

All Allied countries, including the Soviet Union, will be represented, and Abyssinia may also be represented.

### German Spokesman Says No Intention to Attack Turkey Reaffirms Turkey's Use of Ports to Attack USSR USSR May Declare War on Bulgaria

Havas, Swiss Capital, 12th - The "Lausanne Daily" recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Berlin, stating that according to a German Foreign Ministry spokesman, the rumors that Germany intends to attack Turkey are not true. The relations between Germany and Turkey are not only normal but also very good, which can be seen from the fact that the German economic representatives are currently in the Turkish capital negotiating with the Turkish authorities.

Reuters, London, 13th - The National Broadcasting Corporation's Ankara correspondent reports that Turkey will be the topic of discussion at the meeting between Hitler, Ribbentrop, and German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen. General Loder, German military attaché to Turkey, has been recalled to Germany by Papen. Generals will also attend the meeting and will discuss with the army commanders. According to Axis sources in Turkey, the current military and political situation in Turkey will be thoroughly studied by both sides. Reliable foreign diplomatic sources from Bulgaria have not mentioned that Germany is about to attack or concentrate large forces near the Turkish border or in any part of Bulgaria. However, the Germans are making great efforts to expand and reinforce the ports of Bulgaria. It is also reported that the Soviet envoy to Bulgaria has notified his government that if Bulgaria allows the Nazis to set up more operational bases that endanger the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is very likely to declare war on Bulgaria.

Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 13th - The Bulgarian cabinet held a cabinet meeting last night for three hours. The content of the cabinet meeting has not yet been officially announced. Well-informed sources believe that the protests made by the Soviet Union to Bulgaria must have been discussed.

### From Hitler's Attack on the Soviet Union A Thought about Napoleon

Associated Press, New York, 13th - Based on Napoleon's campaign in 1812, Hitler should have arrived in Moscow yesterday. Hitler's failure to occupy Moscow yesterday indicates that he is not as good as Napoleon, and Napoleon's troops marched all the way on foot. Napoleon attacked on June 24 and entered Moscow on September 14. Hitler attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, and the closest point is still 220 miles from Moscow.

### Romania Suddenly Occupies the Timok River Basin Seeks to Control Navigation of the Danube Will Arouse Resentment from Bulgaria

Havas, Bucharest, 12th - It has been officially announced that Romanian troops have crossed the Romanian-Yugoslav border and occupied the Timok River basin in Yugoslavia to ensure the free navigation of the Danube River. Observers here say that although Romania has long threatened to send troops to Yugoslavia, it was quite unexpected that they would actually do so at this time. The area has a population of 300,000, most of whom are Romanians, but it has never belonged to Romania and has always been part of Serbia. Therefore, there are only two possible reasons for Romania's occupation of the Timok River basin: (1) the Romanians in the area will thus return to the embrace of their motherland; (2) the world-famous Iron Gate gorge, which is very important for the navigation of the Danube River, will be controlled by Romania in the future. However, Romania's move is bound to arouse resentment from Bulgaria, as Bulgaria has been demanding control of the Timok River basin for some time.

### British and Soviet Joint Forces Occupy Key Transportation Points in Iran Block Route to Advance East via the Caucasus Difficulty Overcoming Route for Transporting War Equipment to USSR

Reuters, Tehran, 13th - Iranian oil wells are now safely under British control, and British and Soviet forces have occupied key transportation points in Iran, blocking the route to advance east via the Caucasus. The British and Soviet governments are now extensively studying the issue of transporting war equipment to the Soviet Union via Iran. Iran is three times the size of France, but has only one railway and very few highways, so there are still major difficulties to be overcome in transporting war equipment. The three main routes that can be used in Iran are: (1) the railway from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea, which is 1,000 miles long; (2) the highway from the starting point of the Quetta-Zahedan railway in Baluchistan, through Mashhad in eastern Persia, to the Soviet railway on the northeastern border of Iran, which is 1,000 miles long; (3) the highway from Basra to Tehran. As far as the railway line is concerned, the section from Tehran through the Alborz Mountains to the Caspian Sea is expected to be blocked by snow within one or two months. Therefore, materials will mostly be transported by rail from the Persian Gulf to Tehran, then by truck to the Caspian Sea ports, and then by ship to Baku. The lack of trains on the Iranian railway and the problem of clearing snow from mountain highways for three or four months each year are difficulties that must be dealt with.

### Major City in Northern Italy Turin on Fire

Reuters, Vichy, 13th - Vichy News Agency reports that a major fire broke out in Turin, causing great damage.

### European War Talks (79) The Vast Territory and People of the Soviet Union

This article is a record from the New York Times, and is translated as follows:

The first impression that foreigners get when they go to Soviet Russia is simply "vastness." The territory of Soviet Russia accounts for one-sixth to one-seventh of the earth's surface. Excluding the sparsely populated, frigid wilderness in the north and Siberia, and the vast deserts of Central Asia, there remains a very large area with a variety of climates and temperatures, and people of all cultures, from the indigenous people of love tea chamo to world-renowned scholars and scientists.

In the Caucasus and Central Asia, there are continuous mountain ranges and towering peaks. However, the typical scenery of Soviet Russia shows the vastness of its territory. The plains and fields are vast, extending almost endlessly as far as the eye can see. Eleven years ago, the Soviet government, upon the official opening of the new railway connecting Turkestan to Siberia, invited journalists from various countries to attend the opening ceremony. They traveled for six days before reaching their destination.

In addition to this impression of "vastness," one can also get an impression of "multitude." Among all the countries in the world, the number of Caucasians contained within a single political unit is by far the largest in Soviet Russia, with a population of no less than 170 million, and this does not include the newly occupied areas that are now war zones. The entire history of Russia has been largely based on outward expansion, sometimes even clashing with nations close to Western civilization, such as the Swedes and Poles. Although Russia has suffered many military defeats, since the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, no conqueror has been able to make this country with its vast territory and people completely obedient.

One of the characteristics of Russia's natural geography, which can be reflected in the psychology of the people, is its tendency toward extremes. On the temperate European continent, there is no place that can find such extreme cold as Siberia and such extreme heat as the Central Asian deserts. Even though the Soviet government is creating some uniform standards, practically making everyone study the same ideas, read the same newspapers, and have textile mills weave cloth to replace the yarn spun by farm families and the diverse and bizarre clothing worn in the past, one can still see many different races along the way from Minsk to Vladivostok, or from Moscow to the Caucasus and Crimea.

Russians account for more than half of the total population of the Soviet Union. The southern provinces of the country, located in Europe, are fertile plains, mainly inhabited by Ukrainian farmers. In the mountainous Caucasus region, many races and tribes are mixed together. It is rare to see such a situation where people living next door to each other cannot understand each other's languages.

Russia is a Eurasian country. From the nationality and psychology of the Russian people, it can be seen that she has missed three movements that have made great contributions to the liberation of individuality: the Reformation, the Renaissance, and the French Revolution. There is also another layer. The various elements in other European countries that resist autocratic rule, such as powerful nobles, free cities, or important classes among the gentry and commoners, are also non-existent in Russia. Medieval Russian tyrants, such as "Ivan the Terrible," could arbitrarily kill the most powerful noble as easily as killing the most humble serf. This tradition is still preserved under the Stalin government.

Soviet literature and music are deeply influenced by Eastern civilization. Her greatest lyric poets, Pushkin and Lermontov, often depicted the customs of the Caucasus. Linisky Korsakov's dramas or Russian songs and dances all have Eastern colors. The land border line of the Soviet Union in Asia is particularly long, so Russians have much closer contact with Turks, Persians, Chinese and other Asians than Europeans, but Russia's contribution to Eastern ethnology and exploration is quite small.

The personality, thoughts, and even soul of the Russian people have many characteristics that can remain unchanged despite drastic changes in the outside world.

Russians are often rich in abstract ideas. Great writers such as Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Chekhov are sometimes kind and sometimes satirical. Their 19th-century intellectuals often longed for a perfect future world. It can even be said that the entire Russian culture has this kind of ideal (before the 19th century, Russia had almost no civilization except for religious art). As for foreigners—for example, Germans—they can try to improve the imperfect world as much as possible from a practical point of view.

This extreme freedom of thought, although very civilized and moving, is sometimes too idealistic and impractical, and was later swept away by the revolutionary tide. However, it can still maintain its power under Communism. The Soviet authorities drew up two major five-year economic plans, which encompassed everything from the steel industry to barbershops, and nothing was left out of the overall calculation. I am afraid that other nations besides the Soviet Union would not have thought of this!

During my stay in Soviet Russia, I often felt deeply that the Russian mind was full of perfectionism, and almost completely lacked moderation, compromise, and gradual progress. For example, if a communist member cites a few examples of repression and persecution under foreign systems, no matter who tells him that there are countless people who are being repressed and persecuted under the current Soviet system, he will always ignore it.

Communism is new, but this idea of perfectionism is innate to the Russian people. Nicholas Berdaeli, one of the most famous modern thinkers in Russia, once put forward an accurate theory that England is immersed in liberalism and France is fascinated by doubt, but these two doctrines are absolutely not suitable for the Russian mind.

In Dostoevsky's novels, it can be seen everywhere that Russians are very inclined to spiritual extremes, have the ability to explore the hidden depths of the human soul, and are very impatient with moderation. During the Russian Revolution, the intellectual class was influenced by Western civilization through research and contact, and hoped to establish a new political system after the Tsarist government, respecting individual personality and civil liberties. However, their disappointment and material and spiritual pain are self-evident.

The Russian people have an amazing ability to easily regard ideals as facts. They explain future plans as if they have already been put into practice, with vivid language and no embellishment. Imagination has created a bridge between thought and practice, linking them together. This kind of imagination, when used in art, can produce brilliant masterpieces. Russia's most significant cultural success, especially in literature and music, was achieved in the 19th century, and its development was extremely rapid, unlike the gradual progress of the cultures of England, France, and Germany. In terms of art, the Russian people's talent is indeed in the middle of people.

Closely linked to this ability to imagine and artistic talent are intelligence and creativity, which they have also been greatly endowed with. For example, the large-scale parachute descent of troops from the air is the most shocking tactic in modern warfare, but the inventor was the Red Army. However, before the outbreak of this European war, no one could be sure what major impact paratroopers would have on the war. Therefore, comparing the performance of the Red Army in the Soviet-Finnish War with the achievements of German paratroopers in the battles of Holland and Crete, there is really a world of difference.

Reuters, Washington, 13th – The State Department announced last night that the American vessel Montana, flying the Panamanian flag, was sunk by a torpedo en route from the U.S. to Iceland. All 26 crew members, none of whom were American, were rescued. This ship, originally the Danish vessel Paul, was recently requisitioned by the U.S. Maritime Commission and renamed. On August 29th, it departed Wilmington, North Carolina, carrying a shipment of lumber purchased by the Icelandic government, bound for Iceland. According to a naval report, it was sunk by a torpedo at 8:45 AM on the 11th. According to news from Washington, a non-American aircraft happened to be flying overhead when the ship was attacked, and those on board witnessed the crew escaping in small boats after the ship was hit.

Knox stated that British patrol planes witnessed the Montana being attacked by a torpedo. U.S. aircraft did not witness the ship sinking. When asked if U.S. warships had rushed to the scene to search for submarines, Knox stated that there were apparently no U.S. warships in the vicinity.

### What! There's Actually Talk of Restoring the Black Market Exchange Rate; Reasonably, It Can Be Determined to Be a Rumor

Whether the cancellation of the black market exchange rate can be realized this time is still uncertain. Among the bankers who are assiduously seeking profit, there are indeed many who are willing to help China, but there are also inevitably those who like to play tricks in the black market and make quick money in the gaps. Once the black market exchange rate is cancelled, the fat cats who have become accustomed to good appetites over the years, either out of fear of their own government's orders, or unable to overcome the condemnation of public morality and conscience, will have to temporarily put down the "bread in their mouths." However, since foreign exchange is restricted, and they are greedy for the zero-three-one-two-five commission, how can these old men in the style of big compradors, who are accustomed to eating well, using well, living in foreign houses, and riding in cars, truly face the arrival of autumn and drink dew? Unexpectedly, yesterday in the market, the black market exchange rate, which had been silent for five days, actually saw a resurgence. Banque de l'Indochine sold spot U.S. dollars at 4.8125 yuan, which were snapped up by import firms dealing in non-essential goods. The market trend slightly softened, and no further trading was opened until after noon. At noon, the closing prices were British pounds at 2 and a half shillings 8.4375 yuan, and U.S. dollars at 4.8125 yuan, which were tighter by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to the previous day's prices. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. According to a certain person in the exchange market, fourteen British and American banks will restore black market foreign exchange trading next Monday (tomorrow) in order to save the prosperity of the city's import and export firms. This remains to be verified. Banque de l'Indochine is not listed among the fourteen foreign banks, but since it is not among the fourteen banks, how can the U.S. dollars in the hands of Banque de l'Indochine be able to break free from the restrictions of frozen assets and still be freely traded? And why is there talk of others following suit? If so, then the so-called freezing and cancellation of the black market exchange rate is a big joke. It is unlikely that the British and American governments would advise their merchants to comply with it in the front and then go back on their word a few days later, which would make people regard the actions of the great British and American powers as child's play. Therefore, it can be decided that there is no such thing. Looking at yesterday's report on the foreign exchange market, Hua Shang in the United States, due to the inability to withdraw cash, went around selling their U.S. dollar deposit accounts to import firms dealing in non-essential goods so that they could transfer the money to American banks. However, it is now known that the news of American bank transfers is completely inaccurate. From this one point alone, how do we know that the rumour circulating in the market yesterday that British and American firms would restore the black market is not unfounded? However, human hearts are unpredictable, and they are only interested in profit, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign. We cannot guarantee that there will be no black market in the black market exchange rate, or uncontrolled within the scope of control. However, if the black market openly resumes, two exchange rates will inevitably occur, one high and one low. The benefits between the high and low will still be taken away by the middlemen who make quick money. The prices of goods for which foreign exchange is not provided will of course be high, and the prices of goods for which foreign exchange is provided will also be raised. The supply of the officially determined exchange rate has the name but not the reality, and all foreign exchange trading markets will inevitably follow the black market. This kind of trickery will damage the foreign exchange fund, worsen the livelihood of the public, and benefit a group of fat cats related to foreign exchange. Reasonably speaking, there should not be such abnormal and perverse facts, and it is not something that should exist in reality. However, it is said that there is a loophole in the foreign exchange application cancellation guarantee. How do we know that the foreign exchange applied for will not be diverted to other places? This is also unavoidable speculation. However, for the welfare of the public, the more rectified the foreign exchange, the better. Let's see if the rumour circulating in the market becomes a reality. It shouldn't be far away.

Hong Kong, 13th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened this morning very smoothly, and all exchange rates showed no change. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Tianjin, 13th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. The telegraphic transfers from London and New York still showed no change. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by five cents, to ninety yuan. The "Joint Notes" in the gray market were cheaper by three cents seven points, to fifty yuan zero seven cents nine points.

### Cash is Being Searched For Again; Exceeds 9,000 Yuan

Yesterday in the gold market, the speculation in the gray market and the futures market changed to using the Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange rate as the new standard for closing prices. The voice was very high, but it is still under careful consideration. There is talk of a flash opening next Monday, so the bulls and bears on October gold are still constantly closing positions. Although there are rumours from Hong Kong about Sino-Japanese peace, the sudden opening of the foreign exchange black market caused the market price to soften, and short covering was more eager, rising from 6,862 yuan to 6,875 yuan, finally squeezing up by seven yuan, with a turnover of more than 800 taels. Cash also continued to advance upward, exceeding 9,000 yuan, because a certain bank was searching for it again. From the morning opening, it was already 20 yuan higher. Hesheng entered Dafeng ten taels, for 8,960 yuan. Tianyuan suddenly came to enter Dazan ten taels, for 8,970 yuan, and entered Decheng ten taels, Xianghe twenty taels, Yifeng seventy taels, for 8,990 yuan. Xianghe entered Tianyuan, Yongcheng, Dafeng forty taels, for 9,000 yuan and 9,010 yuan, Tongkang Yong entered Tianyuan twenty taels, and Sui Fu called ten taels, for 9,030 to 40 yuan, which were sold by Yifeng and Lianxing, and the market trend once leveled off. Defu suddenly re-entered Chengji fifty taels, Xianghe entered Xinyuan, Yongan, Yida and other eighty taels, rising to 9,050 yuan. Xiangxing Yong and Defu sold out, falling to 9,010 yuan. Xianghe and Yongcheng each entered Tianyuan and other thirty to fifty taels, raising to 9,040 yuan, Xiangxing Yong and Chengji each sold fifty taels again. Finally, Deshun sold Xinyuan ten taels, for 9,010 yuan, which was 70 yuan higher than the previous day, with a turnover of more than 600 taels. The market price of gold bars at the Golden Gate of the Golden House was 9,050 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan. There is no price or market for the current bid gold. The price of jewellery gold was unchanged, still 920 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Futures Squeeze Up Yuan

The opening price of October futures in the grey market at 9:15 am was still 6,862 yuan per bar (ten taels), Chengji Hengji successively entered, slightly increasing to 6,875 yuan, which was spat out by Shunyuan, and was often returned lower. The noon closing price was 6,869 yuan, up seven yuan. The high and low on the day were also 13 yuan.

Ornamental Gold Wants to Rise But Stops

The selling price of gold jewellery in silver buildings was listed by Datonghang and Xintonghang at 10 yuan higher in the morning, for 930 yuan, but it was returned lower at 10:30 am, still listed at 920 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 50 yuan, it is said.

U.S. Dollars Increasingly Needed

Yesterday in the foreign currency market, the cash price continued to rise, and British and American gold pounds each rose by five yuan. British banknotes remained fixed, and the market price stabilized. The demand for U.S. dollar notes was increasingly strong, once pulling up to 11 yuan 70 cents. The noon closing price was 21 yuan 45 cents, which was 25 cents higher than the previous day. The supply and demand of Hong Kong notes were even, and the market price stabilized. The prices of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended upwards, with the former rising to 2 yuan 34 cents and the latter rising to 1 yuan 91 cents.

### Yarn Flowers: Cotton Yarn Momentum Weak; Rally Immediately Returns to Fatigue

The yarn market, which rebounded the previous day, fell back into a soft state yesterday. However, the trend is still moderate, so the decline is winding. However, speculators believe that the previous day's peak of 1,768 yuan failed to break through to a new high, so some turned to short selling. It is also said that there will not be a big rush in the short term, so the sentiment is tending downwards. In fact, the fundamental problem is feared to be still in a state of flux. As for current yarn sales, although there is no development in wholesale, sporadic transactions by Hong Kong merchants are more active. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,766 yuan, the low price was 1,751 yuan, and the closing price was 1,751 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the lack of market at the end of the week, 375 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.

Double Horse opened in the morning with tight sentiment. The opening price was 1,765 yuan. After a short while, due to the decline of the bulls, it fell to 1,761 yuan. However, there were still many people on the floor eager to buy in small amounts, and it rose again to 1,766 yuan. Afterwards, the exchange opened weakly, and the sentiment was relatively lax. However, sellers on the floor did not rush to sell, and it fluctuated between 1,760 yuan for a long time. By the time of closing, because the exchange price was still sluggish, the floating longs were sold off, and it closed weakly at 1,7571 yuan. It is estimated that the turnover in the half day was 8,700 bales. The amount bought by each group is listed as follows:

Same trade 8,500 Hong Kong 200

Total 8,700

The Jin Double Horse futures market situation went from slightly firm to downstream, and the ground seemed to reveal fluctuations. The upward momentum of US cotton has already diminished, and there is no significant stimulus in international developments. The rumors of catching wind and grabbing shadows are old tricks of speculators, so they could not last long and dissipated again, causing the market sentiment to rise and fall like a rabbit and a falcon, seemingly without the strength to continue to be firm. When the market opened in the morning, it was initially firm due to firm factory orders, and the September contract had some short covering, so the trend was still strong for a while, reaching 1,668 yuan, almost opening at a high price. Afterwards, the near-term contract still felt stable, with the October contract opening at 1,679 yuan, a slight increase of three yuan. However, after being dragged down by the exchange, factory orders followed suit, and the period yarn lacked the strength to support it, eventually entering a weak path. Therefore, the November contract fell from 1,692 yuan at the opening, almost closing at a low price. It can be seen that each group seemed to have the intention of selling off one after another. The high and low prices in the half day varied only by five to ten yuan. Large players had no scruples because it was the weekend, so trading was very quiet. As a result, the September contract closed at 1,665 yuan, which was still slightly better by one yuan. The October contract closed at 1,675 yuan, a drop of one yuan. The November contract was even more sluggish, falling to 1,682 yuan and five jiao at the close, a drop of as much as seven yuan and five jiao. Looking at the trend, if the bulls cannot continue with good news for a long time, we should consider the potential strength, so the future may have a winding path. There was no market in the afternoon. The transaction prices are listed below:

### Saturday Cotton Market: Reduced Turnover

The current cotton situation is not very active. Due to a slight improvement in supply and the firm condition of US cotton, factory sentiment has improved slightly. However, most of the trading is in Indian cotton, and other inventories are dwindling. In addition, due to the Saturday factor, all parties lack strong influence, resulting in a significant reduction in turnover.

Another message: There is not much development in cotton trading outside the port. Although factories and various cotton houses have the intention to purchase, they are limited by the inability to settle foreign exchange and repeated delays in shipping schedules, so few actual deals are made.

New York cotton market: Initially, due to positive political news from Washington and unfavorable weather, it rose, and the market situation was very firm. However, subsequently, it fell due to the sale of some floating longs. As a result, the closing price rose by about five to eleven points compared to the previous day.

Indian cotton market: Initially, it fell due to retail sales and long liquidation. However, subsequently, it rebounded due to purchases by European exporters. As a result, yesterday's closing price rose by about one to four维比. It is also predicted that the market will open higher by 0.25 rupee today.

### Securities: Domestic Bond Market Still Firm

The over-the-counter market for government bonds was open for only one session yesterday, as it was Saturday. Due to strong sentiment, it continued to be good. Category C bonds broke through the two-yuan mark again, entered the mark several times, but eventually exited again. It can be seen that the market is stable, and there is no significant change in the environment. When the market opened yesterday morning, Xinfu still had the intention to buy, and Runde Shengda also absorbed some. Retail purchases were also lively. Category C bonds saw a market price of 72 yuan and three jiao again. Subsequently, due to the selling of Gongmao, Yitai, Xie Kang, etc., it once fell back to two yuan, and then closed at two yuan and two jiao. Other varieties also benefited from this, and all rose by three to four jiao. The turnover was about 1.4 million yuan. A brief listing is as follows:

Stock trading: 100 shares of New New Company were traded at a price of 33 yuan and seven jiao and a half.

London, 12th (Week Nine) Telegram: Today's listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks: Chinese government bonds only rose by one pound for the reorganisation British gold, priced at 38 pounds. British stocks suddenly showed an improvement, with Shanghai Tramway shares rising by three pence, priced at 15 shillings and nine pence. Kaiping Coal Mine shares continued to rise by one shilling and six pence, priced at 15 shillings and six pence. Korean Coal Mine shares also rose by one shilling and six pence, priced at five shillings and six pence. There were no other changes.

### Food: Foreign Rice Slow Sales, Short Selling Also Active

Recently, foreign rice seems to be trending in a fluctuating state, and it is still in this state. When the market opened early in the morning, real sales were difficult to handle due to high prices, and ball trading seemed to be taking advantage of the situation to short sell. The original root merchants followed suit, and the market suddenly became soft again, with various prices falling again. For example, the Bank's small package was devalued to 106 yuan. Suddenly, some rural customers bought foreign warehouse small patterned rice, and although the number was limited at one time, it immediately showed a brisk color. In the past, Bank warehouse goods had to be lower by one yuan to one and a half yuan, but now they were almost on par with Bank warehouse goods, only half a yuan apart. Initially, it jumped from 105 yuan to 106 yuan and a half, and although Bank warehouse small packages also rose successively, they only reached 106 yuan and a half, 107 yuan. As for other goods, because the channels in this street were always not smooth, they remained all the way soft and lacked change, with all prices falling by one or two yuan compared to the previous market closing price. Yinghua Si broken rice was 91 yuan, and small packages were 133 yuan to 132 yuan and a half, also slightly weaker than the previous market. The total daily turnover was 23,400 bags of existing rice, and more than 200 tons of Yinghua Si rice.

Thick and thin broken stems and new japonica and other domestic rice: Yesterday, the early rice in Nanhong suddenly had a limited arrival of goods due to rain obstruction, and the sellers' intention to sell turned firm. At the same time, local customers took advantage of the devaluation to be active, and their intention to buy was also strong, so the price suddenly rebounded by one or two yuan, opening at 150 yuan, 148 yuan. Thick stems lacked goods and lacked transactions, and the trading was extremely small, without any honor or disgrace. Pudong new japonica rice continued to be outstanding due to its fresh and fragrant goods. Although the market price on the surface was still only 153 yuan to 152 yuan, in fact, the quality of different goods had already been secretly raised by one yuan.

Glutinous rice: The sales of ordinary goods are less, so even if the goods are scarce, it is difficult to stand firm, and it has depreciated by nearly one yuan, opening at 113,4 yuan to 21 yuan. However, special goods are still quite popular due to their wide sales, and they continue to sell for 127,8 yuan. Glutinous tea follows the lead of the next grade goods, falling by one yuan, opening at 111 yuan, 110 yuan.

### Foreign Vermicelli Slightly Fluctuating

Yesterday, the foreign vermicelli market had mixed ups and downs, but the fluctuations were slight, which was the normal fluctuation in a fair time. Jinlong brand vermicelli sales were active, and the newly arrived Pudong warehouse goods were welcomed by local customers. The warehouse price opened at 31 yuan and three jiao, and then rose to 31 yuan and four jiao and a half. The West warehouse initially fluctuated at 30 yuan and seven jiao, and closed at 30 yuan and eight jiao, an increase of one or two jiao compared to the previous market. However, with confirmed orders and incoming goods for American vermicelli, the fort went from 32 yuan five or six jiao back to 32 yuan three or four jiao at the close. Banana was 32 yuan one yuan to 32 yuan, which was smaller by two jiao. The total daily turnover was still 30,000 bags, with real sales and hoarders each accounting for half. Wheat still had sporadic arrivals, and the market price was variable.

### Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Arriving Steadily

Yesterday, the edible oil market was weak in the spot market and flat in the futures market. It was found that the spot goods were weak and soft because raw soybean oil was arriving steadily, and Changxi also had wholesale shipments to Shanghai, and the actual sales were sluggish and difficult to be smooth. It was heard that the purchase price of Qingdao raw oil had been reduced by another ten yuan, at about 160 yuan. However, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil were supported by speculators who wanted to try their best, so the market was fluctuating and relatively flat. The trading yesterday was very quiet. It was estimated that more than 3,000 dan of Qing oil produced by Dayou Factory were sold in the September contract, at a price of 169 yuan to 171 yuan. There were also nearly 1,000 barrels of rapeseed oil produced by Rihua Factory, at a price of 169 yuan to 172 yuan. There were also 100 barrels of rapeseed oil produced by Taishan Factory, at a price of 160 yuan. There were also 150 cans of Jiangbei soybean oil inquired about in this street, at a price of 238 yuan. Yesterday, 1,500 cans of raw oil and 300 bags of beans came from Tianjin. Today, 500 bags will be transshipped to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods: Although Real Sales Have No New Developments, Cotton Cloth Factory盘甚紧

Factory Cloth: The trend in yesterday's market was flat, with no new developments in real sales, and the factory盘甚紧. Peers and hoarders mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so the market price remained unchanged. However, a small number of out-of-stock goods were still seeing price increases. Wholesale numbers in this street purchased more than 200 pieces. Demand from Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants increased slightly, purchasing more than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, khaki drill, twill colored cloth, etc. Nanyang merchants purchased two hundred and several tens of pieces of coarse cloth bleached and dyed cloth. Today, 1,370 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Dong Cloth: Exchange cotton cloth fell by four jiao in September, fell by叫角四分 in October, fell by one jiao and a half in November, and fell by two jiao and four fen in December. The selling price of spot cloth fell by about one jiao. Four Gentlemen Serge fell by five li. The turnover was very rare, because the market was indifferent and due to the weekend factor.

### New Autumn Woolen Fabrics Sell Well

Now is the new autumn, the weather is turning cooler, and the sales of woolen fabrics are brisk. The real sales of Chinese and Western clothing materials have surged. Various stores in this street that sell woolen fabrics, silk and satin, foreign goods, clothing for men and women, old and new clothing, raincoat and overcoat making places, shoe and hat making places, etc., have strong demand in both retail and wholesale. Because the merchants are restricted by the unified control and the difficulty in obtaining transport permits, only Nanjing merchants are currently purchasing. The hoarding of spring, summer, autumn and winter goods by internal and external merchants is still smooth, making the market even busier. Yesterday, Fengda striped camel hair sold for 8.5 yuan per yard, Weishuanglu picture 12 yuan, Yuanfeng Flying Horse picture tweed 48 yuan, Yinfeng grass green Walter tweed 68 yuan, Dahua sheep picture 55 yuan, Futai first-class suit wool 90 yuan, embossed overcoat wool 220 yuan, Huada Ma Zong satin 4 yuan, Wufeng cotton-woven breeches 3.8 yuan, Yousheng rainproof cloth 6.4 yuan, Yinfeng 1470 French lining 2.2 yuan, black charcoal lining 62 jiao.

### North-South Goods: Walnuts Present New, Longkou Noodles Fall Back, New Xiang Lotus Declines

The first batch of Tianjin peaches was transported by Tianjin merchants yesterday with 38 bags. They were immediately sampled and sold for 200 yuan. It is heard that the Shanghai merchants also have the second batch to do. The market is temporarily flat. Longkou vermicelli was previously available for 210 yuan in the previous market. Later, the demand from Nanyang merchants gradually weakened, and there were only a few transactions in this street. Recently, only Ningbo merchants have purchased more than 100 packages. It is found that the inventory in Shanghai is gradually increasing, so the current market has fallen by more than 20 yuan.

After seeing the new lotus root in this lake, the arrival of goods has increased. Yesterday morning, Hankou merchants opened more than 30 packages, breaking the 400 yuan mark, at 395 yuan, and sold at 398 yuan. The market situation may be tight again.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fall Rapidly

Yesterday, the sugar market was affected by the easing of the Pacific situation, and there were no temporary problems with supply. The sentiment was soft, and the price turned down. The association allocated spot goods of 24 coarse white, September new goods 134 yuan three jiao, August 134 yuan, 33 yuan seven jiao, small yuan half, July 133 yuan, small one yuan seven jiao, June 132 yuan four jiao, small two yuan one jiao, Hong Kong coarse white 124 yuan eight jiao, 24 yuan, with similar declines. Dutch red was 124 yuan, and the market was relatively flat, with few other transactions.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarettes Fall Again

The cigarette market is falling like a broken bamboo, because the factory is constantly supplying, causing extreme panic among all parties. Spot goods in the market are unusually smooth, so the price has plummeted. The market has plummeted by several hundred yuan again, with Great Britain brand 2,150 yuan, Old Knife brand 1,500 yuan, Five Flowers brand 1,070 yuan, Fairy brand 1,130 yuan, Pinhai brand 1,350 yuan, and 20 branches of Da Nan Wei 1,300 yuan per 10,000. However, yesterday's market盘 of Huacheng and Yizhong companies announced price increases. The new prices are detailed in the market price column.

### Seafood: Shrimp Tails Surge to Arrive, Plunging, Winter Mushrooms and Dried Scallops Sell for Hundreds of Yuan Less

Shrimp tails have recently been arriving from various parties, and the value is too high, so the price has plummeted. Yesterday, Shandakan tails opened at 800 yuan, and Chao Bian tails were called for 1,600 yuan. Yantai Longxudao tails and Jiangbei tails also arrived in succession, and the market situation was even weaker, and no one even asked about them. Dried scallops were called for 1,400 yuan. Although the remaining winter mushrooms and fragrant mushrooms were each called for hundreds of yuan less, the industry players were all watching from the sidelines, so there was no market.

### American Bank US Dollar Deposits: Not Allowed to Be Sold to Importers; Depositors Tout Everywhere Attempting to Transfer Accounts; All Banks Refuse According to Instructions; Chinese Banks Are Ordered to Give Special Treatment to Remittances to the Rear

Since the Exchange Equalization Committee formulated measures for the Shanghai foreign exchange market, although various steps are still being implemented separately, their effectiveness can already have a better effect on various aspects of Shanghai's foreign exchange market and finance. According to reporters' reliable sources yesterday, various measures to stabilize the Shanghai foreign exchange market are being carefully promoted. The black foreign exchange market feels that there is no room for maneuver due to the detailed regulations of the Exchange Equalization Committee, and it will inevitably tend to complete decline in a considerable period of time.

US Dollar Deposits: Difficult to Move

Local Chinese merchants in this city are quite uneasy because of the restrictions on the freezing of funds in the United States, and the strict management of the 14 banks in this city by the Equalization Committee. All US Bank US Dollar depositors have no way to move their funds. They are trying to sell them to import merchants who are not allowed to apply for foreign exchange settlement for non-essential goods, hoping to transfer funds in US banks to pay for imported goods. It is now known that the US banks have received instructions from the US government that all account transfers will not be granted. Therefore, the attempts of Chinese merchants in US banks to resell and transfer funds can be said to have vanished.

Inland Transfer of Floating Capital: Ordered to Give Preferential Treatment

The Chinese Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee cooperates with banks of friendly nations and the four national banks of China to manage the Shanghai foreign exchange market, suppress speculative arbitrage and eliminate the black market, and promote the inland transfer of Shanghai's floating capital by the Ministry of Finance and Economics to complete the national construction. Now the four national banks of China and commercial banks have been ordered to formulate appropriate measures to encourage the inland transfer of funds for remittances to the rear, that is, those remitted from Shanghai to various provinces and cities in the rear, with reference to the market situation, such as exempting remittance fees and handling fees. At the same time, the interest rate for funds deposited in banks and firms in various provinces and cities in the rear will be increased, and the government will provide effective security for the safety of principal and interest.

Shanghai Bank Deposits: Reduce Interest Rates

A reporter from the New Voice Society inquired from banking circles yesterday that the deposits of Chinese nationals in Shanghai banks and firms, including Chinese and foreign banks and money shops, were estimated at 285 million yuan by the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China, an increase of almost double compared with the beginning of the war in the 26th year of the Republic of China. However, fixed deposits accounted for only 21%, while demand deposits accounted for 79%. In view of the sharp increase in deposits, the banks and firms feel that the normal investment channels are narrow. In order to reduce the burden, they have all reduced the interest rates on fixed and demand deposits. Demand savings have been reduced from 5% to 1.5%, and no interest is paid on balances below 1,000 yuan for check withdrawals. Fixed deposits have been reduced from 8% to 7%, and all preferential measures have been completely cancelled. Foreign banks do not pay interest on national currency demand deposits.

Remittances to the Interior: Increased

After the banks of friendly nations and the four national banks cooperate fully, the black market for foreign exchange has disappeared invisibly, and various speculative venues have lost their basis. Those who hoard national goods can apply for fixed foreign exchange in accordance with the law for the import of essential goods, so prices tend to fall. Therefore, hoarders have suffered greatly from the elimination of the black market for foreign exchange. The entire finance can be stable for a long time. Recently, Shanghai's floating capital has naturally moved inland, and remittances from banks to the interior have increased. This is indeed a good phenomenon for finance. At the same time, the public bonds issued by the national government, such as unified bonds, are selling well and the prices are high. It is said that some floating capital is used to purchase public bonds.

Shanghai Japanese Merchants: Change of Perspective

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, since the Exchange Equalization Committee stopped supplying black market foreign exchange on the 8th of this month, and also stipulated official prices, implemented unified control and managed foreign exchange, it is a major change for the Shanghai market and the international commodity trading sector. This decision by the Exchange Equalization Committee is actually cooperating with Britain and the United States to economically oppress Japan in the Far East, in order to cut off and suffocate the use of Shanghai for overseas economic activities. The Exchange Equalization Committee has now unified the import of Shanghai, and will also implement the same level of unified control over exports. Therefore, the scope of activities of Japanese merchants in Shanghai will be completely cut off from overseas markets. Therefore, after the United States froze Chinese and Japanese funds, Japan's trade policy shifted from obtaining foreign goods to China, so in the future, the scope of economic activities of Japanese merchants will be limited to this scope. On the other hand, the activities of Chinese and foreign merchants in the future will be completely opposite to those of Japanese merchants. Their management center must be transferred to non-occupied areas, and the external channels must be concentrated in Hong Kong.

### Only Dozens of Americans Returned to Their Country Today

Harrison Wheel Set Sail This Afternoon

American ships are arriving in Shanghai one after another. The President Cleveland and Taylor have left the port one after another. There are still two cargo ships loading and unloading cargo in Shanghai. As soon as the export goods are loaded, they will return to the United States.

Harrison Wheel: Arrived Yesterday Afternoon

Yesterday at about 10 am, the Harrison 　 President cruise ship came to Shanghai from Little Luzon via Port Ya, and docked at buoy twelve or thirteen. It is scheduled to set sail this afternoon to return to the United States. The small passenger ship was decided to depart from the New Customs pier at 11:30 am. Only a dozen people came to Shanghai on the ship. More than sixty people took the original ship to the United States via Shanghai. No more than sixty American expatriates from this city took the ship back to their country.

The famous American news commentator Mr. Alcott is also scheduled to take the Harrison to Manila and the United States for a month's vacation tonight. Yesterday afternoon, the American Chamber of Commerce specially hosted a banquet for Mr. Alcott at its address on Fuzhou Road, while the British Zhuojia Air Force Association also invited Mr. Alcott to attend the association's special luncheon at 12:30, and presented a silver cup as a gift. The British Expatriate Association also presented a watch as a token of farewell. Earlier this month, the expatriate residents of the American Revolutionary Movement in Pingjin jointly presented Mr. Alcott with a silver Beijing Temple of Heaven model, which was about a foot tall. The night before last, when Mr. Alcott bid farewell to the audience on China-US joint broadcasting, he said that he would still return to Shanghai.

Arrival Dates of Two President Ships

The Pias President ship, which is about to resume sailing to Shanghai, is expected by the shipping industry to arrive in Shanghai by way of Hong Kong from San Francisco Manila before the 　17th of this month. Then, it will sail directly to Honolulu and San Francisco to return to its country, carrying as many passengers as possible. The New Voice Society Reporters have reliably learned that the date of the Coolidge President ship's return to Shanghai along the original route is set before October 6th, and it will also return to Shanghai from Manila and Hong Kong to load cargo to the United States. The above two ships are the routes set by the American President Line Company, and the notification to the shipping industry should be true.

### Hong Kong Airport: Cargo Inspection Measures

Goods Transported to the Interior Must Be Pre-Certified; The Order of Certification Will Be Determined According to the Urgency of Need

Since the China and Eurasia Airlines opened the Hong Kong-Nanhong route, handling passenger and cargo transportation, the passenger ticket from Hong Kong to Hong is 270 Hong Kong dollars, the cargo is 3.7 Hong Kong dollars per kilogram, the chartered plane is 7,000 Hong Kong dollars, carrying 900 kilograms, and it is stipulated that urgent government documents must be transported first. Commercial goods are numbered in the order of registration. However, some unscrupulous people are actually operating in collusion, soliciting the transport of goods and trying to manipulate them for profit. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Communications, in order to adjust cargo transportation and prevent malpractices, specially established the Air Cargo Inspection Office, and appointed Huang Boqiao, the former director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, as the chief inspector of the office, which has been implemented since September 11. Shanghai merchants should pay attention to the internal transport of goods. The inspection measures led by the Ministry are recorded as follows:

### 100,000 Bags of Small Grain Rice Will Arrive at the End of the Month

According to news from the rice industry, the 60,000 bags of Yangon small pattern rice ordered by the Shanghai Food Rice Public Warehouse Committee have been loaded by the Panama wheel Deda and are sailing to Shanghai. The ship is expected to arrive at the port around the 25th of this month. However, whether the public warehouse rice will be sold at a flat price immediately after arriving in Shanghai, or temporarily stored in the warehouse, it is heard that the committee will make a decision again temporarily. It is also learned that the 40,000 bags of small grain rice purchased by various rice merchants in this city will also be shipped to Shanghai one after another within the month, so the future of the people's food in this city is indeed optimistic.

The association has already completed preparations and will hold a memorial service at 2 PM today in the grand auditorium on the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association. It is reported that over thirty charitable, educational, and commercial organizations, including the World Red Swastika Society and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Native Place Association, will participate, and it is sure to be an occasion of great solemnity. The eulogies from various organizations and elegiac couplets from all walks of life are recorded below:

Portrait of Mr. Wang Dan Kui

Eulogy

On this, the fourteenth day of September in the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, at this memorial service, we, the representatives of all the participating organizations, Tang Wenzhi, Shen Wei, Wen Lanting, Jiang Weiqiao, Shen Enfu, Shi Zhaozeng, Ye Erkai, Chen Taoyi, Huang Qinglan, Ding Fubao, Guan Jiong, Zhang Yipeng, Zhao Xi'en, Li Xidun, Lu Ruiqing, Yao Minghui, Zhu Zhiyao, Zhu Shaowen, Jin Qiyuan, Feng Yangxian, Zai Boqi, Chen Chen, Li Dixian, Pan Weibing, Miao Yonglou, Zhang Kangpei, Qu Cengze, Lu Jia, Du Tingzhen, Gu Nanqun, and others, respectfully offer incense, silk, wine, and libations to the spirit of the honorable Wang Dan Kui, saying: In learning, you sought the Way; in serving, you achieved merit. The Way is vast in substance; merit is grand in application. Uniting knowledge and action, you responded to circumstances without end. You inherited strict teachings, pursuing righteousness and reason. You studied the teachings of Cheng and Zhu, and the similarities and differences with Lu and Wang. Transforming empty words into practical use, you expanded outward while remaining rooted within. When you were in the central government, you stood upright in court, tirelessly devoted. Agriculture, commerce, foreign affairs, finance, and transportation all benefited from your sense of justice, prioritizing righteousness over profit, and sincerity over deception. You treated the virtuous with exceptional favor, while the powerful masked their exclusion with promotion. Although your official career ended with an external appointment, your upright reputation reached the emperor's ears. When you were in the localities, you valued agriculture and cherished grain, facilitated commerce and benefited workers. You leveraged the rich resources of the Taihu region to alleviate the suffering of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. You exhausted your mind and body in diligent labor, personally walking the fields in the south and east. Surpassing Yu the Great's eight years of toil, you dedicated your entire life to the task. Though projects were sometimes hampered by economic constraints, your plans were comprehensive and detailed. Success need not originate from oneself; careful planning illuminates like a new dawn. When you were among your fellow villagers, you were diligent in production and frugal in consumption, living simply and modestly. You treated all equally, from spring planting to autumn harvest. You found joy in bamboo, trees, flowers, birds, fish, and insects. You established agricultural farms to promote male farming and set up yarn factories to improve female handicraft. The source of food and clothing was abundant, and the way of teachers and scholars flourished. Your lectures filled every space in your halls, and your books overflowed your library. Rejecting the frivolous language of poetry, you compiled collections of essays on statecraft. You left behind writings to pass down to your descendants. With your turban, everyone had a path to follow; with your painted fan, every household had a Fang Weng. In regulating yourself, you were like jade in the rough, like hemp growing upright. You valued diligence over laziness, and thrift over extravagance. You were purer than the waters of Jian Lake, and loftier than the paulownia trees of Dragon Gate. You were never ashamed of your peers, and you never felt guilty before heaven. Thus, your conduct transformed the stubborn and inspired the weak. Your words awakened the deaf and enlightened the ignorant. In dealing with others, you commanded respect upon sight and approached with humility. You were like the warm breeze of a spring terrace and the gentle rain of Dongshan. Overseas Chinese wept at your sight, and even barbarians were moved to harmony. You believed that those from afar would come and those nearby would be pleased, without distinguishing between the wise and the foolish. Some of us relied on your support, some were sheltered by your protection, some clung to you like vines on a pine, and some were shaped by your guidance and refinement. We lament the passing of this great elder, our hearts heavy with sorrow. We remember your full life of blessings, your father serene and harmonious. We pray, "A hero among thousands, a leader among ten thousands. May your reputation be as enduring as the mountains and rivers. Enjoy this offering."

Elegiac Couplets

(1) Standing upright in court, never flattering, skillfully managing and enriching agriculture and commerce, Jiangsu mourns your passing. Heaven suddenly envious, your model should be enshrined in the local temple, the people grieving in their hearts. Protecting road rights, skillfully managing water conservancy, Guanzhong compares to Zheng Bai. The mountain collapses, where do we look? The masses together wipe away tears. (Jiang Weiqiao, President of Chengming College) Heaven does not spare, the model is suddenly lost, literature is not yet lost, the teachings are always new, (Li Zhaohuan) the same Sun Shiyu neighborhood, the Jiangsu style is now exhausted, there is Qi Shangshu reputation, the township evaluation still exists, (Mao Guangsheng) the market court remains hidden, the country loses a sage, (Guan Jiong) Southeast lost an old man, behavior enough for thousands of years, (Hu Pu'an) Noon traces celebrities, achievements, articles are immortal, Spring Shen long hidden, death of man and country have the same grief, (Wen Lanting) Great Shou eighty-two years old, tooth virtue both promote Jijiu, Juqu 30,000 hectares, facilities are only Yang Yimo, (Huang Qinglan)

### George Liddell Visits the American Consulate to Discuss Concession Administration

Deliberation on the Selection of Members for the Advisory Committee, Negotiations on the Western District Tax Loss Not Yet Concluded

The British Consul-General in Shanghai, George, accompanied by Liddell, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), visited the American Consul-General, Lockhead, at the American Consulate at 11 AM on the 10th, for a lengthy discussion lasting an hour. This event is considered very important by all parties. According to a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, George and Liddell visited Lockhead to discuss issues related to the administration of the concessions. Organizing an advisory committee and deliberating on the selection of its members is one of the issues under discussion. Since the SMC decided to levy a special property tax at its meeting on the 3rd of this month, it must obtain the approval of the advisory committee before it can begin levying the tax next year.

Dual Demand for Taxes in the Western District

According to the North China Daily News, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Hori, stated at a press conference yesterday (the 12th) that residents of roads outside the Shanghai Western District may have to pay taxes to both the SMC and the city center. Previously, a reporter asked about residents in the Hongqiao Road area who had been asked by tax collectors from both sides for property tax and car license fees. The Japanese spokesman explained the situation, saying that the city center seems to believe that it is qualified to collect various taxes and has sent people to collect them. The dispute over roads outside the concession has not been resolved, as both sides insist on their right to collect taxes in this area. "Therefore, he does not know how residents in the area outside the concession can avoid paying taxes to both sides," he said.

Negotiations Still in Progress

A reporter said that these residents have even received warnings that if they do not pay taxes to the city center, they will not be allowed to use their cars. The spokesman replied that it is natural that car owners who do not pay the license fee are not allowed to drive. Negotiations between the two sides are still in progress to resolve these issues, he said. According to an SMC official,

Three Districts Will Use a Joint License

The proposal to resolve the outstanding issues such as the Western District taxes and to jointly use car licenses in the three districts has made progress in the negotiations between the two sides since Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the SMC, returned to Shanghai from vacation. When the reporter asked about rumors that the results of the tax negotiations could be decided in writing next month, the official stated that the talks between the two sides have not yet concluded, so it is impossible to predict when an agreement will be reached. According to the plan for a joint license in the three districts, car owners do not need to obtain separate licenses for the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Western District. They only need to obtain one license to travel in these three districts.

### No Such Thing as Expanding Telephone Lines

According to the Shanghai Telephone Company, although the need for telephones is currently very urgent in all industries in the city, the supply of raw materials has been affected by the war and cannot be replenished. There is no truth to the rumors that the company has shipped a portion of the materials to Shanghai and is actively expanding its lines, and that new users can apply for installation and be connected next month.

### Dredging Smaller Riverbanks

The Huangpu River and other smaller riverbanks have not been dredged since the end of the war, resulting in silt accumulation and rising riverbeds, which is one of the reasons for water accumulation on the roads. The SMC Works Department has hired workers to dredge the smaller riverbanks. Last month, a total of 0.3883 kilometers of riverbanks were dredged, and 10,220 cubic feet of silt were removed.

### Japanese Soldiers Shot in Hongkou, Seriously Wounded in the Chest

Three passersby were injured by stray bullets, bridge closures restored at noon

At around 10:30 AM yesterday, another shooting of Japanese soldiers occurred in the Hongkou District. After the incident, in addition to imposing security measures and searching the area, all bridges over the Suzhou Creek were temporarily closed. The details are recorded below:

Shot Three Times

At 10:30 AM yesterday, a Japanese Navy Private First Class, Kusuhara Kunio (30 years old), was walking from the Marine Corps headquarters, intending to go to a certain place on Fair Road for official business. Unexpectedly, when he passed a deserted area on Fair Road near Zhoujiazui Road, five assassins suddenly jumped out from the roadside and opened fire on Kusuhara. Kusuhara was unable to dodge and was hit three times, all in the chest. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the assassins fled without a trace.

Passersby Injured

The Huishan Police Station and the Japanese military police authorities received the news and immediately dispatched personnel to the scene of the incident, first cutting off traffic and conducting a major search, but to no avail. They then sent the wounded soldier to a Japanese military hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are serious and his life is in danger. It was also discovered that stray bullets injured three passersby during the shooting, including: (1) Su Gaoxing (33 years old, local resident, residing at 895 Zhoujiazui Road), the bullet entered from the back and penetrated deep into the abdomen, also seriously injured; (2) Yu Chuanqi (25 years old, Chongming native, residing at 922 Chengcheng Lane, Zhoujiazui Road), injured in the right leg; (3) Miao Shiyu (25 years old, Changzhou native), injured in the abdomen. All were summoned by car and sent to Shanghai Convalescent Hospital for medical treatment.

Bridge Closures

After the incident, in addition to imposing temporary martial law in the area where the incident occurred and searching for the assassins, the Japanese side also closed all bridges over the Suzhou Creek, prohibiting pedestrians and vehicles from entering or leaving. Even Japanese residents were not allowed to pass freely. The strictness of the security was unprecedented. It was not until around 11 AM that the bridges were reopened. It was also learned that the Zhonghong Bridge in the Hongkou District would also be closed after 3 PM, but only Chinese residents were prohibited from passing. Japanese and foreign nationals were still allowed to pass. As of the time of writing, there has been no progress in the above-mentioned bloody case.

They were taken to the French Concession Police Department and interrogated. It is said that they were immediately extradited by the Japanese to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou. At around 5 PM the day before yesterday, personnel from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, accompanied by the French Concession Police Department, sent detectives to Apartment No. 3, No. 76 Avenue Haig, to arrest a person, but were unsuccessful.

### Charity Tea Dance to Raise Funds for the Children's Home Today

Starting at 4:30 PM at the Lido Garden, All-Shanghai Red Star Volunteer Dance Partners, Tickets Ten Yuan, 500 Children to Perform Arts Programs

Since Mr. Gao Huailiang became the Director of the Shanghai Children's Home in March of this year, he has spared no effort in rectifying the affairs of the Home. He is deeply concerned about the physical health and intellectual development of all the children in the Home. He has also worked hard to raise more than 200,000 yuan for the expansion of the Home and the purchase of decorations. However, there are more than 500 children in the Home, and the expenses are enormous. Moreover, with the prices of all goods soaring, the average monthly fee for each child is approximately 55 yuan. The total monthly expenses of the Home exceed 25,000 yuan. Among them, the largest expenditure is for rice, which accounts for almost half of the total amount. Therefore, the large amount of donations from major benefactors over the past six months has been almost exhausted. Furthermore, the Home has no foundation funds or subsidies from any source. With the autumn wind rising and the weather gradually turning cold, the winter clothing for the entire Home urgently needs to be purchased. Therefore, with the support of social celebrities and enthusiastic benefactors, a charity tea dance to raise funds has been initiated and will be held at the Lido Garden on Route Mestre on the 14th (today) starting at 4:30 PM. At the same time, all the Red Star volunteer dance partners in Shanghai have been specially invited. More than 80 people have agreed, and a portion of the Red Stars will also join in today. Tickets are ten yuan per person and include a complimentary refreshment. All 500 children from the Home will be present to perform various music and art programs. Order booklets will be distributed in the venue. The detailed income and expenditure of Mr. Gao's tenure are listed to ensure credibility. It is also heard that this tea dance has received strong support from all sectors, and the presale of tickets has reached more than 150,000 yuan. At that time, the Lido Garden will be the scene of an unprecedented charity tea dance.

### Soliciting Old Toys for Poor Children

— Bai Zheng

Any child, upon hearing the word "toy," welcomes it without exception. Indeed, toys are a wonderful thing. They can walk, run, call out, jump, move, and smile... they are simply like real things, and even more adorable and fun than real things.

Dear children, I believe you must have many lovely toys at home. Moreover, your parents love you dearly and often buy toys displayed in the windows of large department stores, giving them to you to play with after you come home from school, making you smile and feel extremely happy. You are truly blessed! But do you know how many poor children stand in front of those windows, gazing blankly at the toys? They love toys just as much as you do, but they are unfortunate enough to be born into poor families, where they cannot even get enough to eat, let alone have any money to buy toys. They can only stand in front of the windows, staring blankly, and they truly envy you for having toys and being able to go to school.

When you get tired of playing with old toys, or they break, you throw them into a corner, and your parents buy you a new and more fun one to play with. Your parents are wonderful, and you should study hard to repay them. But have you ever thought about those poor children who are not fortunate enough to have toys? They are also someone's children, and they don't even have a single old toy to play with. Do you feel sorry for them? Now, you have a great opportunity to make use of your old toys, which is to share these old toys with poor children so that everyone can play together. You may think that old toys are not much fun? That doesn't matter. Now, there is a Rotary Club toy hospital that is requesting old toys from dear children, whether they are old or broken. After they repair them, they will distribute them to poor children. So, please hurry up and search in the corners of the walls or under the beds for old toys and ask your parents to send them to the Madi Motor Company at No. 640 Avenue Joffre, or call Mr. Mabo Le at No. 13016, and they will send someone to collect them. They will be very grateful, and dear children, you will have done a good deed! I wish you good health and more toys!

### Do Not Fail Those Who Support You

— Yang Chunlu

To my dearest children! Do you know? I am envying you, praising you! You, you, you are truly the favored children of heaven! You, you, you are truly blessed with happiness! You, you...

How fortunate you are, having food to eat, clothes to wear, and books to read. But have you considered? How your fathers, your mothers, are tirelessly working, all for your sake.

Especially now, when the cost of living has reached extreme levels; rice, coal briquettes, rent... which one hasn't risen again and again? Under such circumstances, maintaining a family's bare minimum living is already extremely difficult, where would there be any strength left to support your schooling? Yet, your parents, unwilling to let you suffer the pain of dropping out of school, still reluctantly send you to school. If you still don't know how to study diligently, how will you face your parents?

The scholarship fund campaign of this newspaper is precisely for this reason. To the children who have received the grant! I can't help but congratulate you. You have not been hindered in your future by circumstances, you can still continue your studies, fulfilling your aspirations. Your future remains bright. Your future holds boundless hope. However, you should work even harder to live up to the earnest expectations of this newspaper and the donors.

Dear children! Now is the time to start working hard, do not fail those who help you, nurture you!

### Cricket

— Liming

It's not the mild spring, nor the harsh winter, nor the sweltering summer, what is it? It is the cool autumn. Although the autumn weather is not as cold as winter, many trees, flowers, plants, insects, etc., cannot withstand the damage of frost, so they hide long before winter arrives. At this time, we can no longer hear the chirping of the katydid and grasshopper, but crickets come to take their place. We can often find them in grass heaps, at the foot of walls, or under flower pots. We catch crickets and keep them in pots to play with. Sometimes, everyone picks out the best ones and puts them together in a pot to fight. Crickets are good at fighting, so when two crickets meet, they fight each other. There is always a winner and a loser, and the winner is considered the king.

We only regard cricket fighting as a game; but now some people are using crickets as gambling stakes. Some people, because they cannot find the best cricket, often pay the highest price to buy one, or send people to find them everywhere. The amount they gamble is as high as several thousand yuan. Therefore, when autumn arrives, people are excited to raise crickets again, and compete fiercely with others. But we children should remember that it is absolutely unacceptable to use crickets for gambling.

### The Golden Beetle's Dream

— Le Yue

The moon maiden rides a curved little boat,

Floating in the azure sea of the sky.

A beautiful little bug with golden armor,

Is falling deeply into a sweet dream.

It dreams of green leaves covering thick shade,

Red flowers spreading sweet fragrance,

It slowly climbs up the trunk to the branches,

To explore the glittering golden sunlight.

It also dreams of abundant golden fruits,

Hanging all over the trees.

Whether they are big or small, sweet or fragrant,

It eats and eats to its heart's content, tastes and tastes again.

It also dreams of the bright, clear moonlit night,

When the mischievous children have all gone to sleep,

It accompanies the grasshopper and katydid,

Playing beautiful music, how clear and bright.

Waking up, it opens its eyes and looks around,

Dead leaves are hanging on the branches, swaying,

The west wind brings cold;

The white dew brings desolation.

It looks at the bare branches,

No longer a place to settle down.

It only blames itself for indulging in enjoyment at the beginning, and that's why it ended up like this!

### The Uses of Sesame

— Fangfang

Children probably all know what sesame is. Haven't you eaten sesame cakes or large flatbreads? The small things stuck on the bread are sesame seeds; also sesame oil, the oil squeezed from sesame seeds, is a very good seasoning when put in side dishes and in soup. Perhaps children have also seen sesame planted in the fields. The stalks are square, the leaves are round and pointed, with a sheen. In autumn, they bloom with white flowers, and the seeds that grow are of two kinds, black and white, which are black sesame and white sesame.

In our country, sesame is mostly used to extract oil. In addition to extracting oil, some of it is used for food, such as the sesame cakes, sesame candies, sesame brittle, etc. that we often eat.

At the same time, before the war, it was also a major agricultural export product. A lot of it was shipped to foreign countries every year. Italy, France, and Japan were all buying it in large quantities. Japan bought it to make seasoning, while France bought it to make perfume. As for Italy, they used our sesame to make gunpowder. It is said that the oil content in sesame is very high. After a certain amount of heat, the explosive power is very great. It is better than sulfur-based explosives for making burning and explosive materials. Don't catch crickets in dirty places! Made by Ni Changmin.

### Solar Eclipse

— Yingting

Rui'er saw in the newspaper that there would be a solar eclipse at noon on the 20th of this month. He was very happy, but he didn't know what a solar eclipse was, so he ran to ask his father.

"Dad! What is a solar eclipse? Can you tell me the reason for it?" "Solar eclipse? Okay! I'll tell you." His father took out a globe, a candle, and a round mirror in the room. First, he put the globe and the candle on the left and right sides of the table, and then said to Rui'er:

"People in ancient times regarded the wind, rain, thunder, and lightning in nature as unpredictable mysterious phenomena, thinking that gods were angry and showing off their power. This is not surprising in ancient times when knowledge was naive. They thought that a solar eclipse was a misfortune for the sun, a very unfortunate event; but in this enlightened 20th century, those unfounded superstitions have been broken by scientists and astronomers one by one." At this time, he lit the candle and continued, "Today, I will use the candle as the sun, the round mirror as the moon, and the globe as the earth." As he spoke, he inserted the round mirror in the middle of the candle and the globe, and then asked Rui'er, "Can you see the solar eclipse now?" Rui'er looked up at the sky, stunned like a wooden chicken. He saw the scorching sun high in the sky, and the heat was overwhelming. He thought, where did the solar eclipse come from? His father knew that he still didn't understand, so he pointed to the things on the table and said, "Look, this is the situation during a solar eclipse! If we look into the universe from the earth at this time, do you think we can see the entire sun?" Rui'er thought for a while and said with a smile, "Is it because the sun's light is blocked by the moon?" His father nodded and said, "That's right! Now you should understand. When the moon is between the sun and the earth, forming a straight line, it will form a solar eclipse; at the same time, because they are all rotating rapidly, their positions are constantly moving, so the time of the solar eclipse is very short."

"Dad! How long should it be?" Rui'er asked happily.

"Two hundred and two seconds, totaling only three minutes and twenty-two seconds!"

"Dad! Who discovered the principle of solar eclipse?" he kept asking.

"This was discovered by Thales, a famous Greek astronomer more than 500 years BC."

"Dad! He..." Rui'er was still asking questions when he suddenly heard his mother calling them to have lunch, thus interrupting their conversation.

### The Old Frog Who Overestimated Himself

— Ye Fei

An old frog was resting on a duckweed in a pond when his son suddenly ran over to him in a hurry and said:

"Mom, there is a huge cow over there, very, very big!"

"How big is it?" the old frog asked.

"Very, very big!"

After hearing this, the old frog drank a lot of water, making its belly very big, twice as big as before, and asked the little frog, "Am I as big as that?"

"Bigger than you!" the little frog replied.

The old frog drank some more water and asked, "How about this?"

"Still bigger than you!"

The old frog drank some more water: "How about this?"

"Still bigger than you!"

The old frog was extremely angry, so it drank as much as it could, as much as it could possibly drink.

"This way..." Before it could finish speaking, with a pop, its belly burst.

Children, what are your thoughts after reading the above story?

### Rambling Talk about the Amazing "Shouchun Pot"

— Su Shaoqing

The Contribution of Radio Broadcasting to Peking Opera

I have been broadcasting Peking Opera on various radio stations for four or five years, so I have a little understanding of the methods and order of broadcasting. Especially when it comes to special programs, such as gatherings of famous amateurs and famous actors, the number of people is large, and the order is extremely difficult to maintain. Once the order is chaotic, everything becomes rushed, and the program loses its brilliance. This is a common phenomenon. On the 10th of this month, Hongxiang Company held a large broadcast for advertising its business. The broadcasting of Peking Opera by the Damei Radio Station gathered almost all the famous amateurs and actors in Shanghai. I was also dragged by a friend to sing "Sangyuan Jizi," the "Tan Xiongdi" and "Jian Fentai" sections, facing the air. Zeng Xinzhai and Jin Shaogang were on the drums and playing the instruments, respectively, and they were both considered good hands in the martial arts and literary circles of the amateur scene. The report by comedian Zhang Yezhi was especially energetic. My singing inevitably lost its skill. There might be a sentence or two that was listenable, but suddenly I felt powerless, and I felt that I didn't sing well. In addition, the broadcasting room was smoky and crowded with people, and some people were talking and laughing next to me. Sometimes they even touched the head of the broadcasting machine, making it tremble as if it was about to fall to the ground and take a break. The place in the room was originally not big, but it was filled with many people for ten hours. Inside, it was so hot that it seemed like you could cook an egg. Once you went in, you felt difficulty breathing, so few people could sing comfortably. I received preferential treatment from the company and the friends who handled the matter, and I am definitely not writing this article to satirize out of dissatisfaction. I am writing this because every time there is a big broadcast, especially of Peking Opera, there are such phenomena. Every time it is so chaotic, everyone feels uncomfortable, so I am now offering my humble opinions to all parties involved in future big broadcasts of Peking Opera. Before a big broadcast of Peking Opera, the stage manager and the heads of each group should pay close attention. The number of people broadcasting should not be too many, and the broadcasting time for each person must be accurate. The order should not be changed. Although not absolute, it is relative. In the broadcasting room, except for the staff, the stage crew, and the person broadcasting at the time, visits should be absolutely refused. The announcer should speak less, and the sentences that need to be conveyed should also be said once every fifteen minutes or ten minutes. What is even more important is that a certain amateur group or a certain small group should be invited to sing a duet or a scene from a play, which would be more interesting and save time. Someone might ask: How can the time be accurate? I say: You have to use a car to pick them up. For groups, you can use a large truck, which is also fine. Go to pick them up at the appointed time, and after a short stop, they can sing, so there will be fewer people who go early on their own. Someone might say: Wouldn't the transportation costs be very high? I say: Amateurs practice for a year, two years, ten years, twenty years, and some even have forty years of experience. It is not set up for people to earn money, so even if it costs gasoline, it does not seem to hurt frugality.

### Watching Charity Performances at the Russian Theater

— Jiang Xiangyi

The other day, Mr. Zhang hosted a charity rehearsal to raise educational loan funds, which was performed at the Russian Theater. At the invitation of a friend, I arrived at the theater around 7 o'clock. From the "Tiao Jia Guan" (a traditional auspicious opening act) to "Cosmic Front," a total of seven plays were performed. The first was "Nanyang Pass." The singing, accompaniment, drums, and huqin in this play were all terrible. Then "Saving the Emperor at Phoenix Mountain" had no good points to mention. Then came "Scolding the Emperor." "Scolding the Emperor" is a very common play, but Mr. Sun Songling's performance that evening was quite extraordinary. With his ability to calm down, he was best suited to play imperial hat dramas. In terms of singing skills, although he only used the "Ruan Liu Zi" tune, the slow tempo, high tempo, and the original tempo in two sections were sung in order, tirelessly. In terms of melody and words, he strictly followed the rules. (According to Mr. Fan Shiren, a friend of Mr. Sun, who talked about the play.) It is not easy to achieve such results in a debut work. Miss Zhang Yuhua, a senior disciple of the retired female performer Hong Xuefang, played Empress He. (See copper figure) This was also her first time performing this play. Miss Zhang is young and beautiful, with a graceful figure. Her voice is bright and high, and her movements are delicate and not charming. She is also a promising talent. After "Scolding the Emperor," "Visiting the Mother" was performed. Mr. Chen Yi played Si Lang, and Miss Qiu Yiming played the Princess. Although the tones were high and low, the singing was very stable. Miss Qiu's expression was particularly profound. Unfortunately, the two amateur musicians playing the huqin and erhu were always out of tune, unable to help Miss Qiu, which was a great loss. The closing performance was "Cosmic Front" by the famous amateur Mr. Li Baosun, a play with heavy singing and acting. Mr. Li performed more and more exquisitely, which is gratifying. The young male role was played by Mr. Li Shiwen, a former famous amateur in Nanjing. Mr. Li's movements were admirable. Although Mr. Li is a new friend of mine, I have seen him many times in the Qingchang (solo singing) arena. He has deeply mastered the Mei School's style of play. I didn't expect to see him on stage and see such amazing results.

### Matchmaker

— Shasha

The Yan Zhou marriage change, which caused a stir for a while and gave people material for conversation, has now passed and is gradually being forgotten. However, because both parties have considerable history and connections in the singing world, a new song that describes the process of their love and marriage, "Matchmaker," was created by Chen Dongsun writing the lyrics and Yao Min composing the music, and it has been widely sung, becoming a remnant of this event. Now, with the consent of Mr. Chen, I am transcribing the original lyrics as follows for readers who love to sing.

The clever and beautiful little matchmaker (Zhou's nickname is Xiaohong) learned to sing from a young age. She has an affectionate lover, who is young, strong, and ambitious. One loves her for her elegance, and the other loves him for his generosity. The seeds of love grow, and artistic partners get married. Who knows that the river of love has many waves, and from then on, the lovers find it difficult to stay together.

Heaven is jealous of that little matchmaker, and an unwarranted misunderstanding caused disaster. They forget the old days in a fit of pique. The matchmaker angrily leaves him. One is as if drunk, and the other wanders everywhere. Both think quietly, and share a long relationship of nine years. Clouds cover the moon are also common, and it is not difficult to reunite the broken mirror.

The resolute little matchmaker is unwilling to lower her head to obey her lover, and even reports her grievances to the newspapers. The marriage change of the matchmaker spread everywhere. One says he is slandering, and the other says she is frivolous. Both refuse to give in to each other. The mandarin ducks will never be together again. They put aside the old love like a dream, and are willing to strive for glory in their careers. (Unpaid)

Chapter 16 Taking a Pet Bird Out of Its Cage Early

Tian Hongyu raised a glass to celebrate his birthday, and San Gui also returned the toast. He glanced over and saw a beautiful woman among the concubines, with light makeup and elegant clothes, playing the pipa, sitting in the middle. She often spoke before the rest of the ensemble, like the leader of the female music band. Her feelings were charming and delicate, completely different from her peers. Her bright eyes were charming, and her gentle feelings were clear, like a fairy from Yaotai. He couldn't help but feel his heart flutter and his mind wander, and he began to fantasize. So he instructed someone to call the bodyguard in and open the luggage he brought with him, taking out a set of casual clothes to change into. He immediately took off his military uniform, just like Yang Shuzi, who used to wear light fur and a loose belt when he was young. Tian Hongyu couldn't help but secretly praise him. The concubines were also secretly turning their eyes, admiring the elegant demeanor of the general. Wu Yigui had also been staring at the beautiful woman in light makeup for a long time, and couldn't help but point at her and ask Tian Hongyu, "Is this beauty Chen Yuanyuan from Jiangnan? She is truly a beauty who can overthrow a country, rare in the world. The imperial father-in-law is very lucky to have her." Tian Hongyu didn't want to answer anything, he just nodded and smiled at him, saying, "The general's judgment is indeed correct." San Gui then asked Tian Hongyu to have Yuanyuan play a pipa piece alone. Tian Hongyu then asked Yuanyuan to play a solo for General Wu. Yuanyuan agreed in a charming voice and turned the pegs and plucked the strings, playing a piece of "High Mountain and Flowing Water," which Tian Hongyu usually listened to, loud and clear, like pearls falling on a jade plate, gentle and affectionate. San Gui listened attentively, while Hongyu tapped the beat with his chopsticks. Tonight, Yuanyuan played the pipa with even more hand movements and eye expressions, with a wonderful and transcendent skill. After the song was played, the lingering sound was still lingering, making people feel relaxed and fascinated. San Gui then asked Tian Hongyu, "Yuanyuan is the leader of the singing and dancing troupe in the imperial father-in-law's mansion. She must be able to dance like Feiyan. Can you have Yuanyuan dance so that the young master can broaden his horizons?" Tian Hongyu naturally couldn't refuse, so he ordered Yuanyuan to dance. Yuanyuan tidied her sleeves, lightly moved her lotus steps, and walked to the front of the banquet. An maid walked over and handed her two pheasant feathers. (170)
