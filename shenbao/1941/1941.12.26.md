Manila (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 25th (Reuters) - A U.S. military spokesperson stated this morning that Japanese forces are still sending reinforcements continuously. There is fighting along the entire front line, but there are no significant changes in the battle situation.

With each landing, Japanese aircraft intensified their air raids. Currently, Japanese forces have occupied ××× city.

Washington, 24th (Havas) - The War Department released a communiqué today stating that a large number of Japanese transport ships have been discovered near the southwest of Luzon, apparently seeking a landing site south of Manila in order to attack Luzon from both sides.

Manila, 24th (Havas) - Air raid alarms were sounded three times here today. The first was at noon, when several Japanese aircraft flew overhead and bombed port facilities, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. Residents throughout the city maintained order and strictly followed the orders of the air raid wardens. The second alarm was at 2 PM, when several Japanese aircraft bombed industrial areas outside the city. The third alarm was at 3 PM. Although Japanese aircraft flew overhead, they did not drop any bombs. The alarm was lifted at 3:40 PM.

Manila (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 25th (Reuters) - Belligerent nations have unofficially regarded Manila as a undefended city, which can be seen from the following incident: Three groups of Japanese aircraft circled overhead for an hour today and did not drop any bombs, and anti-aircraft guns did not fire at the Japanese aircraft.

Furthermore, the Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun" criticized this morning the Manila radio station's claim that the U.S. defense authorities in the Philippines are currently considering declaring Manila an undefended city, expressing surprise. It is said that this is likely a propaganda tactic by the U.S. side. It is almost unimaginable that Manila could be regarded as an undefended city, for no one knows better than the U.S. authorities in the Philippines how well-defended Manila is. Moreover, it is well-known that Manila has long been regarded as an extremely important base for the United States when attacking Japan. If Manila is designated as an undefended city, then Singapore, Chongqing, and Hong Kong must also be regarded as undefended cities, it was said.

### Washington Conference Continues to Discuss Military Cooperation Issues, Roosevelt and Churchill to Deliver Important Speeches, General King Says U.S. Needs to Replenish Naval and Air Power Urgently

Washington (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 25th (United Press) - Senator Barkley announced that Churchill will deliver a speech to a joint informal session of Congress on the 26th. Members of the Supreme Court, cabinet members, and other senior government officials will attend. Roosevelt is also likely to attend. Churchill's speech will be broadcast.

Washington, 24th (Havas) - According to various newspapers, the main topics of the military conference currently being held here between Britain and the United States are: 1. The possibility of German leader Hitler opening a new battleground or launching a new offensive. If so, the anti-Axis countries will need to allocate more important war materials to various battlefields. 2. Whether the main countries participating in the war, namely Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union, will focus all their efforts on the Soviet and Middle Eastern fronts, and whether the war against Japan in the Pacific will be temporarily put on the back burner, all of which will be decided. Furthermore, according to reports here, there is no immediate threat to the Pacific fortresses along the American continent. As for establishing a unified command, as General Foch did in the last World War, it is difficult to achieve due to the excessive distances between the current battlefields, it is said. Washington (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 24th - It is understood that the issue to which the Anglo-American war conference is paying the most attention is strict naval and army action, rather than supply and economic issues. At the close of the first meeting yesterday, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson told reporters that he believed the meeting was very successful. It is understood that the possibility of the Nazis suddenly seizing the French navy and its bases was considered during the discussion of naval issues. On this point, Britain and the United States have indicated to Vichy that if the French navy surrenders, Britain and the United States will regard it as a hostile act. Senator George said that he believes that the result of strategic cooperation between Britain and the United States may be that the leaders of the two countries will separately command their armies and implement an overall strategic plan. This plan includes large-scale American participation in the Atlantic battle. The routes from South America to South Africa and then to the Middle East and China and India will become the main supply lines for the Allied countries in the Far East, it was said.

Washington, 24th (Havas) - According to a dispatch from the "New York Sun's" Washington correspondent, one of the important issues discussed by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill during their talks was the possibility of organizing an American expeditionary force and sending it to various battlefields.

We must do our best and take good care of ourselves. But we need more planes and warships. Once we have a large number of planes and warships, we can strike a painful blow. Given time, we will definitely win," he said.

### Pope Pius XII's Christmas Message Advocates Five Principles to Eliminate International Disputes

Haitong News Agency, Vatican, 25th - Pope Pius XII delivered a Christmas address, in which he said, "If we look at this world, it is difficult to find comfort. Humanity will destroy itself through war. In this sacred moment, we hear a strange call from the spire of the Church, saying, 'The King of Peace is surrounded by a glorious atmosphere, and the people of the world want to see his true face,' but this call soon disappears. Now, millions of people and families around the world are in a miserable situation, but we can also see everywhere in the world people bravely defending their inherited rights and territories, sacrificing themselves, and fighting for justice and righteousness. When we think of the injured and the prisoners of war, the bitter fate, the physical and mental torture, the death and destruction, the large cities and industrial areas that have suffered air raids, and the countless people who have fallen into poverty and hunger, we cannot help but be saddened. But today, the way to find a solution is still far away, because the goals of both sides are so far apart that it is not easy to achieve mutual understanding." The Pope does not recognize the failure of Christianity as one of the causes of this war. He said, "Christianity has not failed, but people have violated the true Christian spirit and teachings. The prosperity of material things and the progress of technology are not in themselves a disease, because what is harming the world today is what benefited us yesterday. The solution to all of this is to return to the throne of God, believe in God, and find the rights and obligations that are endowed to every individual and every group, and rebuild a strong foundation. Regarding the relationship between countries, the misuse of freedom and power should be restricted. The future reconstruction work can lead to good or evil. Only people with vision, determination, and courage are needed to bear this heavy responsibility, but often some people dream of establishing a new world order and seeking new paths because of the victory in the war. The original intention is to bring prosperity, happiness, and progress in the future, but if their construction work violates reason, justice, and humanity, they will inevitably deviate from the original intention and cause tragic results. We have learned from history that peace agreements, their spirit and provisions, are often contrary to our conscience, so they have no ability to exist. The existence of long-lived peace agreements has never been seen in history, which is a clear proof. The pain caused by this war is truly unbearable for mankind. To avoid such a catastrophe, it cannot be done by the power of one country or one group. All countries must find a way to avoid it. Therefore, it is a worldwide event, so it cannot be achieved without seeking Christ's help. I am now calling on the people of the world to pay attention to this danger that threatens peace, and it is also my responsibility. If the countries of the world want to avoid the horror of war, they must act in accordance with God's natural law." The Pope then suggested five essential conditions for maintaining international order, namely: 1. Under a new order based on religious principles, no matter the size or strength of a country, it must not violate the freedom, security, and territorial sovereignty of others. 2. Under this new order, the rights and special interests of minority groups in terms of faith, language, economic activities, and natural prosperity must not be openly or secretly oppressed. Within this scope, the state may require its minority groups to fulfill their civic responsibilities. 3. Under this new order, raw materials and natural resources of others must not be acquired in a selfish way. Often many countries disregard this principle, so most of the disputes of the "giver" of raw materials arise from this. 4. We must not allow the horror of war, the economic, social, and moral degradation to strike mankind a third time. If we want to prevent mankind from suffering again, then limiting armaments is necessary. International treaties must be observed, and all treaties must be concluded in accordance with the principles of justice and equality. Although there are many difficulties, if the leaders of all countries can cooperate sincerely, they will definitely achieve their goals. 5. In the new order, there must be no embarrassment of religious affairs, because faith is the gateway to moral sanctity, so that all kinds of virtues can enter the treasure house of the soul. Faith can create a strong character, which is absolutely necessary for building a new world order. Regarding social issues, if employers and employees both believe in the one God, then the solution to the matter is as easy as flipping the palm of one's hand. Atheism, which opposes God, is a great enemy of the new order. All those who believe in Jesus Christ and his laws, their spirit of love and sacrifice, can make a great contribution to social transformation.

It is expected that this Soviet problem can be resolved by next year. The German army, navy, and air force, under the personal command of the leader, are taking this as their main task. However, the war should not be limited to the Soviet Union. In other battlefields, Britain and the United States will also encounter fierce battles from the signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact.

### Goebbels Delivers a Radio Address

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a radio address to the German people and frontline soldiers last night, stating that Germany is able to celebrate this third Christmas during the war. Although we have to be slightly thrifty, at least we do not have to fear the threats of the enemy. This is all thanks to the brave men who protect the motherland. Those who are abroad, in this festive season, their love for the motherland and compatriots will naturally arise. These brave soldiers can keep the motherland from being engulfed in the flames of war, and they are truly proud. Goebbels then declared to Germans overseas, "Most of you live in a hostile world. We Germans are fighting to protect our right to exist, but unexpectedly, we are envied everywhere. Our overseas compatriots are often surrounded by groups of hatred. We, who are in the country, only occasionally learn one or two things from the newspapers. You, who are in the situation, have almost no day without tasting this unfair treatment. Only because the few are no match for the many, our innocent compatriots are threatened and insulted by others for no reason, and are the target of their malicious propaganda. The reason why they are willing to endure humiliation without saying anything is only because they love our motherland. Today, the motherland knows how much responsibility they have fulfilled for the motherland. They do not want us to fail. We vow to work hard for them. If the motherland itself is not prepared to sacrifice, then the sacrifices made by millions of people today will inevitably be equal to being wasted. We must work hard, we must prepare to sacrifice. Victory is not a gift given by others, it must be strived for by our efforts. Everyone should fulfill their responsibilities. We must work together to win victory. The more we think of the leader, the more we should work harder to complete Germany's strongest front line. We must make our nation a greater and more beautiful nation after this war, and complete our free country. This is what we should promise the leader tonight. The leader can rely on his people at the front, in the country, and abroad. He is the leader for the rest of us. We vow to follow him with one heart. Carry the German flag, move forward. When the day of victory comes, the German flag and the country will be safe and sound. I wish you all a Merry Christmas. The hymns we sang in the past were to pray for world peace. Today we should strive to achieve this peace. 'Seek peace from victory.' This is our slogan," he said.

### Crowds Still Swarm to Buy Low-Priced Rice; Selling Methods Should Be Improved; Workers Return to Their Hometowns in Droves; Rice Prices May Be Re-Negotiated

Since the authorities of the two concessions have taken active measures to stabilize the city's overall rice supply, it is reported that there is no need to worry about rice shortages. Rice shops will soon universally sell domestic and foreign rice. The current crowded situation of people buying rice may gradually decrease. Yesterday, a certain gentleman from the Food Management Committee stated that the committee will re-evaluate and set the selling price of rice.

Workers and Their Families Return to Their Hometowns

The warehouses in the city, both Chinese and foreign, are still very full. According to a survey, the total rice storage in the city (including Hongkou, Pudong, West Shanghai, and the Central District) is over 650,000 bags. However, recently, many factories have suspended work, and most of the workers and their families have returned to their hometowns. The number of dockworkers who have dispersed is even greater. Therefore, the city's population is clearly decreasing. Statistics show that the majority of citizens who have left Shanghai this month are estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. The exact number cannot be determined. It is estimated that a monthly consumption of 210,000 bags of rice will be sufficient to meet the demand. Moreover, the bad practice of hoarding is gradually disappearing. Progress has also been made in dredging Vietnamese rice. Two million dan of Anhui rice are ready for transport. The food problem for Shanghai citizens can be expected to improve.

Crowds Still Buy Rice; Planning to Improve

Although the committee is now making every effort to maintain the balance of rice supply and demand, it hopes that residents will understand and cooperate, and not be alarmist and hoard food, so as not to weaken the rice warehouse storage. In the future, for the benefit of the public, it is possible to continue to strictly prohibit illegal hoarding, and if necessary, conduct large-scale investigations to suppress bad practices. According to rice shop owners, the best way to solve the crowding problem in retail sales is for the rice office to improve its collection methods to be quick and efficient. More collectors should be assigned, and the retail quantity limited to three *sheng* per person should be moderately increased. Rice shops should be evenly distributed and universally sell rice to avoid rice buyers running around and crowding each other.

The Trade Union Urges People to Collect Rice Coupons

According to the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association, the rice coupon issue for various rice shops in the public concession has been completely processed. However, there are still seven rice shops in the French Concession that have not collected these rice coupons. The association is eager to disclose the handling of rice coupon matters and hopes that these seven rice shops will quickly collect them to complete the procedures.

Abnormal Weather; Winter Feels Like Spring

The local weather is still controlled by the anticyclone, and the climate is very hot and humid. Although it is mid-winter, it feels like spring, and the humidity is very high, which poses a serious threat to public health. Therefore, many hospitals have cases of diphtheria, typhoid, and relapsing fever. Agricultural production has also been affected, and spring plowing is a major concern. The price of vegetables has also been surprisingly low in recent days.

### The French Concession Administrative Council Approves Next Year's Budget, Which Greatly Exceeds This Year's; Mayor Maurice Speaks

Havas's Shanghai dispatch: The French Concession Administrative Council held its last meeting of the year on the 23rd of this month and approved the budget for next year. The total amount is 51,943,879.43 yuan, which is a significant increase compared to this year's 33,183,358.55 yuan. The reasons for this increase are attributed to the following three factors: 1. Increased prices of raw materials; 2. Doubled public relief expenses; 3. Salary adjustments for French Concession staff in various agencies. Before the adjournment, Councilor Maurice spoke, stating: "First, the members of the council, taking advantage of the last meeting of the year, would like to express their respect to the chairman of the council, Consul General of France in Shanghai, Mr. Magre, for his leadership since taking office, especially during these turbulent times. In addition, the council also requests the Consul General to convey their regards to Colonel Fabre, Chief of Police of the Concession, Mr. Tan Gu, Director General of the Municipal Council, and all staff members." Consul General Magre then delivered a response, saying: "All the staff of the French Concession Police and the Municipal Council have been able to remain loyal to their duties, regardless of any sacrifice. For example, the deaths of Judge Dugue and Sergeant Rutinon are proof of that. The council is composed of representatives of Chinese and French residents and expatriates from various countries, who have been able to cooperate effectively in their joint work. The council members have given me great help in spirit and in material terms, for which I am deeply grateful. I hope that in the coming year, I will continue to rely on your strong support to alleviate the suffering of residents due to unemployment and food supply difficulties. I believe that we can overcome our current difficulties by cooperating with the Japanese authorities."

Thirteen Ounces of Gruel per Bowl Distributed

The Shanghai Buddhist Benevolent Association, Yusheng Association, Lianyi Benevolent Association, Huangwan Association, and more than a dozen other benevolent organizations jointly organized a gruel distribution association. Yesterday, a meeting was held to revise the distribution quantity of gruel. The following is an excerpt from its official letter to various organizations: “Dear Sirs, a meeting of various gruel distribution organizations was convened at 2:00 PM on the 23rd of this month. Regarding the issue of the amount of gruel distributed, it was decided that the original gruel tickets (six *fen*) will still be used, with three tickets exchanged for one bowl of gruel, weighing thirteen ounces according to city scales. Each organization will be responsible for the investigation, and in addition to notifying the various gruel shops to strictly comply, the gruel shops will adjust the price every three days and verify the records."

### Public Buses Now Run All Day, Cancelling the Morning, Noon, and Evening Shift System; However, the Number of Vehicles is Reduced and They Return Earlier

Public buses in the Public Concession, previously limited by the insufficient storage of gasoline, had to be changed to a morning, noon, and evening shift system to facilitate traffic. However, due to the shortened operating hours on each route, the number of passengers along the way has increased sharply, causing crowding and disorder, and concerns about accidental dangers to passengers. Therefore, the company has tried to increase the number of services and has achieved satisfactory results. Yesterday, all bus routes 1, 2, 9, 10, and 14 have officially resumed operation from morning to night. However, the number of vehicles on each route has been reduced, and all buses are scheduled to return to the depot at 6:00 PM every evening. However, bus route 7, which runs to Xujiahui, will remain suspended.

### Tenants Rejoice as Landlords Are Temporarily Prohibited from Forced Eviction

The Municipal Council has announced that landlords will not be allowed to forcibly evict tenants who are temporarily unable to pay rent before March 31 of next year. Tenants generally rejoiced upon hearing the news. According to some tenants, if a tenant has the ability to pay rent, they will certainly not use this order from the Municipal Council to refuse to pay rent or demand rent reduction. Moreover, such a move is unlikely, as all rent disputes that cannot be resolved amicably should be submitted to the Conciliation Committee of the Municipal Council for review. The Municipal Council's order benefits citizens in that there are indeed many tenants who are temporarily unable to pay rent, or can only pay a portion of the rent, due to the current economic situation. They were extremely worried about being forcibly evicted. Upon hearing the announcement of this order by the Municipal Council, they all felt relieved.

### Christmas Gleanings

— Ya Xi

As usual, the Westerners' winter solstice festival, Christmas, has come and gone. Indeed, Shanghai belongs to Christmas. Christmas is active in Shanghai! Look!

The streets are interwoven with the fine web of human traffic: ape-like women, playboys, suits, leather shoes, curled hair, rouge, perfume... shiny cars coming and going like gusts of wind! (Too few, unfortunately!) The silver shops' glass windows display luxurious ornaments, so eye-catching! The silk and satin bureaus hang dazzling brocades and satins, so beautiful! In the confectionery shops, lotus root powder osmanthus cakes, and crispy goose oil rolls, cost five yuan each, ten yuan each, so delicious! In the company's display windows, Santa Claus distributes gifts, but the gifts remain in the display windows! Ah! What isn't luxurious and extravagant! What doesn't do its utmost to entice! Yet, all this is to celebrate Christmas!

In the dance halls: "Annual Christmas Carnival, Unprecedented Grandeur!"; "New Look, Christmas Festival, Even More Lively!"; "Nobleman's Chinese Cuisine, 500 Yuan Per Table, Sumptuous Dishes, 50 Yuan Per Guest!"; "Also Precious Toys Distributed to Guests!"; "Famous Beauties Dance Together; Strong Lineup, Powerful Music!"

In the theaters: "Taixu Taoist," "Playing in the Mortal World"; "Riot in the Department Store," "Helpless Destiny"; in the warm air, the scent of women wafts out, posing gracefully, nestled in the arms of gentlemen with cigars!

In front of the Great World, there are particularly many women, with graceful figures, adorned with flowers, jewelry, and silks; their mouths red, their eyes flashing with hopeful light, slowly sending you autumn waves. You know, these are the goods of the meat market.

If you are not a careless walker, my friend, if you stroll down the road with an attitude of leisure, listen (you can hear it at any time)!

- Hey! Old Li, yesterday my three reverses, what luck! I drew a treasure, then drew another one on the *gang*, wow! Self-drawn Clear One Suit and Peacefully Won! Ha...

- Damn it! Eight rounds and lost five bottoms, really weird!

Or:

- The day before yesterday I went to Lidu to set up a fortune-telling stall, that newcomer... isn't she? - That's right, the beauty Wang Lili.

- Correct!…

The restaurants, I'm not bragging, are no less lively than before. Big and small, Hongyun Restaurant, Dafa Restaurant, once the night market opens, the lights are red and the wine is green. It really is "Guests fill the seats, the wine jars never empty!" "Oh, how glorious and magnificent!"

You know that these are all clever people, "Life is like morning dew," "Drink today's wine today!" In this chaotic world, why not seek pleasure?

Also - Zhoushan live turkey, sausage and bacon soup, essential for celebrating Christmas.

Let's have a "news clipping" to embellish this Sino-Western festival...

"Xu Daquan hacked his brother to death, sentenced to ten years imprisonment…"

"The truth about the tragic fire at the Pingan Hotel, the victims cry out for help…"

"Two bombs found on Gongguan Road."

"Important steps to maintain people's food supply, successful suppression of flour prices…" gradually became blurred in the vast sky, but the feeling of the night remained. The streets flooded with the tide of people, and the flashing steel rails were just as busy, crowded, and noisy!

But now, time has passed, and although it is Christmas, apart from one or two places that are still bustling and prosperous as before, most other places have fallen into a desolate state!

The tall foreign buildings stand quietly on both sides, and the dim streetlights cast long shadows of the bare trees on the ground. The heavens suddenly shed a drizzle of rain mercilessly, as if to deliberately tease, Santa Claus has disappeared into who knows where, crying.

### Current Bank Withdrawal Procedures Remain Unchanged Before the New Year Holiday; No Definite Procedures for Withdrawal and Salary Payment

Banking circles in the city, both Chinese and foreign, have indicated that various banks' payment procedures will not be further modified until after the holiday. Banks will be closed on the 25th and 26th, and the first three days of next year.

Restrictions on Foreigners' Withdrawals Remain

Recently, major British, American, and Dutch banks have been following the same rules and procedures for withdrawing cash from personal accounts, with no special changes in terms of procedures. Foreign banks continue to implement remittance procedures as usual. Currently, British, American, and Dutch expatriates are allowed to withdraw 1,000 yuan from banks each month. People from non-enemy countries against Japan are allowed to withdraw 1,000 yuan per week, totaling 4,000 yuan per month. Chinese banks allow individuals to withdraw 500 yuan every three days from their accounts. However, the payment methods still vary slightly.

Withdrawal and Salary Payment Procedures Unclear

Various businesses continue to apply to HSBC, Citibank, and Chase Bank for withdrawals to pay salaries, but the details are still unknown. According to people in the banking industry, it is still too early, and the procedures for how businesses will be able to withdraw funds to pay salaries have not yet been clearly explained.

### New French Water and Electricity Prices

The French Concession's French water and electricity company yesterday notified users in the Concession, stating that from January 1, 1942, charges will be collected according to the newly established prices. The newly established prices are excerpted below: - Electricity for lighting: 6.2 *jiao* per KWH; - Electricity for power: 0.4 *yuan* and 0.39 *yuan* per KWH, depending on whether the total installed capacity is below or above 14 horsepower; - Electricity for heating: 0.38 *yuan* per KWH; - Tap water: 0.38 *yuan* per cubic meter.

Power Company Imposes Temporary Surcharges

For ordinary users whose electricity usage period is revised within January 1942, the Shanghai Power Company should add a fuel adjustment fee and various basic charges (including electricity price, appliance rental fee, and various service fees) to the bills for the temporary surcharges collected. The temporary surcharges for the fuel adjustment fee have been approved by the Municipal Council and are calculated as follows: - Fuel adjustment fee: 1.626 *qian* per degree; - Temporary surcharge: 200%.

### No Permit Required for Transporting Coal Under 1 Ton

It is reported that coal merchants transporting any smoke-free white coal under one ton do not need to obtain a transportation permit from the Coal Management Committee. For quantities of two tons or more, standard procedures must be followed. A permit fee of 4 yuan in national currency is charged per ton. It is heard that coal merchants within the French Concession can apply for permits from the French Police Department. However, the transportation permit is only allowed for transporting coal within the two concessions and is strictly prohibited from being transported to other places. Otherwise, if discovered, it will be confiscated and forfeited.

### Guangxia Cup Successfully Concludes; Yiguang Triumphantly Wins the Grade A Championship; Shisheng Suffers a Narrow 5-4 Defeat in the Final; Ruilong and Mengshi Draw in the Exhibition Match

The second Guangxia Cup Small Ball League successfully concluded yesterday, and the champions and runners-up of each group have also been determined. In Group C, Youyong defeated Guangxia 2-1 to win the championship. In the exhibition match, Ruilong and Mengshi B each scored one goal and drew. In the final match of Grade A, Yiguang narrowly defeated Shisheng 5-4 in extra time to win the Grade A overall championship and the large silver cup donated by Chen Shichang. During the Youyong vs. Guangxia match, Guangxia player Sun Defu's behavior was improper and repeatedly violated the rules of the game. The referee, Jiang Yinsheng, announced the cancellation of the player's right to participate in any cup competitions held at the Guangxia field forever as a warning.

In the Grade C match, Youyong took the initiative and scored the first goal. The first half ended. Guangxia's counter-attack was ineffective, giving Youyong another opportunity to attack and score another goal. Two minutes before the end of the match, Guangxia finally pulled one goal back. As a result, Youyong won the championship 2-1.

Exhibition Match

Mengshi used a mixed team of Grade A and B players. Tang Genfu received the ball on the line and shot powerfully, scoring the first goal and ending the first half. Ruilong did not want to be outdone. Chen Linxiang received support from Xu Xisheng and shot into the goal from ten yards. Time ran out, and both sides tied 1-1 and shook hands in peace.

Grade A Championship

Yiguang's Zhao Yongfang went deep into enemy territory alone and scored a goal. Shisheng counterattacked, and Liao Shiyi built a goal on the border line and tied the score. Before long, Shisheng's Ye Yiting scored a goal from a distance, taking the lead by one goal. In less than five seconds, Tao Tingfu attacked, and Ye Qingfu put the ball in the net. The first half ended with a 2-2 draw.

Re-Fight

Shisheng's Zhu Weizhong scored another goal. Yiguang's Zhao Yongfang resumed his role and scored a goal, making it 3-3. Before long, Yiguang's Li Guanghua fouled and was penalized with a 12-yard penalty, which Liao Shiyi took. Shisheng took the lead again. The good times did not last long. Defender Tang Yongfang committed a foul and was penalized with a 12-yard penalty in the same way. Zhao Hefang took the penalty and scored. Time ran out, and the score was tied 4-4. No one could tell who was the champion, so they played for an additional ten minutes. Yiguang had a good opportunity for a corner kick, which Lin Zhaojun scored. Yiguang finally defeated Shisheng 5-4 and won the Grade A overall championship. The recorded match results are listed below:

Youyong Wins Guangxia (Grade C Final) 2-1

Ruilong and Mengshi Tie (Exhibition) 1-1

Yiguang Wins Shisheng (Grade A Final) 5-4

### Economic Talk

— Feng

The economic talker previously stated that he would no longer publish in this magazine, but yesterday was Christmas, and new commercial topics were lacking, so this short article was used as a filler.

Sandboats

Before the prevalence of steamships, coastal transportation, especially to the north, relied heavily on sandboats. According to Qi Yanhai's "Proposal on Maritime Transport to the South" during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty:

"Going south from the mouth of Wusong, through Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, is called the South Ocean. Going north through Tonghai, Chongming, Shandong Zhili, and Guandong is called the North Ocean. The South Ocean has many islands and reefs, with deep and turbulent waters, making it impossible for bird boats to navigate. The North Ocean has many shoals, with shallow and hard reefs, making it impossible for anything but sandboats to navigate. Bird boats must have a draft of more than ten feet, while large sandboats only have a draft of four or five feet... Sandboats gather in Shanghai, about three to five hundred ships. The large ships can carry three thousand *dan* of official grain, and the small ones can carry one thousand five to six hundred *dan*. The shipowners are all wealthy people from Chongming, Tongzhou, Hainan, Baoshan, and Shanghai. Each ship costs seven to eight thousand taels of silver to build. Some own as many as forty or fifty ships, so they are called ship merchants. Since the lifting of the maritime ban in the twenty-fourth year of Kangxi, over ten million *shi* of soybeans and wheat from Guandong arrive in Shanghai every year, and cloth, tea, and various southern goods are also carried north to Shandong, Zhili, and Guandong by sandboats."

As for why they are called sandboats, "Treatise on Sailing" says, "Jiangnan sea boats are called sandboats because their bottoms are flat and wide, and they can travel and anchor on sandy surfaces without being hindered by slight grounding. They often travel from sand ports to Huai'an, trading crabs. Therefore, they are most familiar with the depths of the sandbanks. Sand ports are deep channels between sands. Zhejiang sea boats are called egg boats, also known as 'three unlikes,' and can also pass through sand, but cannot get close to shallow places because their hulls are heavier than sandboats. Only the Min and Guangdong sea boats have round bottoms and high sides, with three large pieces of wood attached to the bottom, called keels. When encountering shallow sand, the keel sinks into the sand, and if the wind and tide are unfavorable, there may be problems. This is because they travel in the South Ocean, where mountains and reefs are mixed, and ships with keels are more flexible in turning and avoiding obstacles (i.e., the bird boats mentioned earlier). If going to Tianjin, they must first go to Jinshan in Jiangnan to stop the ship, wait for the west wind, and sail east for a day to avoid the shallow sand before sailing north to ensure safety. Therefore, they only go to Tianjin and Fengtian once a year." (To be continued)

### New Proposals for Sugar Storage

Because the sugar market's registration in the concession has not been completed, free circulation is still not possible, so there is still no market. However, there are new proposals, such as the establishment of a new cooperative to try the 20% tax theory. It is uncertain whether it can be realized.

### Tangerine Peel Candies Out of Stock

Tangerine peel candies have recently been blocked by ships, and no goods have arrived. The previous batch of dozens of pieces has already been sold out. Even the old stock of tribute cakes has been sold out. A small number of products from this factory are sold at very high prices and have not been successfully integrated into cigarette sales.

### Cigarettes: Not Much Honor or Disgrace

Cigarette prices are trending upwards. Yesterday was a regular holiday, and there were few transactions among peers, so there was no significant increase or decrease in price. Big Ben brand was 3,800 yuan, Old Knife brand was 3,600 yuan, Pinhai brand was 3,000 yuan, Little Fairy brand was 2,740 yuan, Fifty-Five brand was 2,630 yuan, fifty Big Ben brand was 700 yuan per 10,000, fifty Big Front Door brand was 820 yuan, and ten Big Front Door brand was 820 yuan. Daily necessities such as matches, soap, and candles did not fluctuate significantly due to strict government restrictions. Phoenix brand matches were 1,450 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap was 51.5 yuan, and Sailboat brand candles were 39 yuan.

### Water and Electricity Prices Increase Again!

— Liao Ran

In recent days, the poor common people have been truly desperate for a way out in order to live: all 133,000 pores are strained; the forty-two pairs of major nerves are all clamoring for a general mobilization. For rice, they have to seek help everywhere, and even that is not enough, so they must "queue up." For coal briquettes, they have to plead in every way, and even after pleading, they still have to "line up" and proceed in a snake-like manner. The day before yesterday, when the rumor spread, bread and pancakes were once again the cause of panic, turning the citizens into ants on the edge of a hot wok!

Fortunately, the authorities of the two concessions, in order to maintain the people's livelihood, have racked their brains and done their utmost to continuously take steps to suppress prices, so as to stop the crisis. If the millions of citizens do not appreciate this, they are utterly foolish.

After days of intense effort, the price of flour has been suppressed. Although the crowding to buy rice has not eased, the General Council must have good solutions. All living beings, bustling and hustling, what are they doing? For the sake of life, they have no choice.

However, the French Tramway and Electricity Company yesterday announced an increase in water and electricity prices. (The power company also has an announcement.) This was an unexpected thunderbolt, leaving users stunned and numb! This time, the "change" is only a statement that it "will" be implemented from a certain month and day, and the style is even more straightforward than the last so-called "adjustment." Although the euphemism of "adjustment" is much more tactful than the direct "price increase" of the last time and the time before that, the overall result is the same: prices rise sharply, and the people's discontent erupts. People cannot live without water and fire, and the same goes for electricity. But this forces people who are already scrambling for rice and coal briquettes to also scramble for water and electricity. Under the premise of having to accept the increase, we common people, around the warm Christmas season, really have no other choice but to collect fireflies for light and drink rainwater all day long.

Go to bed early, save electricity for the night. The authorities have repeatedly warned everyone to abide by this together, large and small households alike, to save power. This is indeed hardship, and we think it is absolutely right, there is no need to discuss it. However, while eating pancakes and noodles, using the money saved from the reduced price of flour (this is not a dream, the price of flour did indeed decrease the day before yesterday, we solemnly declare this), from one dollar and fifty cents per catty to ninety-five cents, to subsidize the cost of electricity, while "drinking water, remembering the source," there is a true "cutting flesh to heal a sore" pain. Moreover, in the eyes of the company authorities, taking such extraordinary measures repeatedly cannot help but harm the harmony of heaven and earth. But we do not really hope that the French company authorities will "cut flesh to heal sores." It is difficult to do both big and small things well. As you said, public utilities are not comparable to "running a business by being stingy," but it is also unnecessary to operate at a complete loss. So, what should be done? "Hold fast to the middle ground." It is also said, "Though you miss the mark, you are not far from it." This is acceptable. Frankly speaking, water and electricity fees have increased recently: once on October 1st, once on December 1st, and again on New Year's Day next year. The interval between them is less than two months, actually changing twice in one month, which truly makes people "never forget." If there are no restrictions, I fear there will be three changes in one month. Moreover, the so-called surcharge on the bill was happily canceled by the company authorities in mid-August. Isn't adding a surcharge on top of a surcharge unsightly? Or is it that the surcharge has become too insignificant to "intensify"? If the adjustment exceeds the budget, this kind of "profit budget" cannot help but arouse suspicion and confusion. However, the accounting system does not seem like child's play, and the items in each part are always very clear.

Although military strategy says, "Attack where they are unprepared, strike where they are unguarded," from the perspective of the Public Works Bureau rescuing the people from water and fire, "If you build a mountain and stop before completing one basket, stop. I stopped!" And then after that, this "emergency measure" needs to be considered very carefully!

### Christmas Eve 1941 in Shanghai

— Meng Gong

"The Public Works Bureau recently issued a notice stating that the closing time for public places such as bars, restaurants, hotels, and dance halls on special holidays should be limited to 2:00 AM."

"The ban on private cars has been in effect since 9:00 AM yesterday. The Public Works Bureau is very strict in issuing driving permits. It is reported that there were about 1,500 applications for continued driving, but only about 650 were approved by the Public Works Bureau."

Christmas 1941 quietly arrived in such a situation. Although the dance hall advertisements in the newspapers still occupy a full page, using words such as "carnival all night" and "giving away exquisite toys," and even the words "Kiss competition" to decorate this "special holiday," the citizens trapped in food and fuel shortages obviously do not feel much interest in this year's "special holiday." It comes so quietly, like a poor relative going to the home of a declining wealthy family, unnoticed.

At 10:30 PM, it was raining, making the air of Christmas Eve particularly desolate. Public transportation had all returned to the factory. The long streets became a no-man's-land. The sleepless city—Shanghai—was asleep.

With the mentality of Grandma Liu, I went to a top-class dance hall with a door ticket as expensive as twelve yuan, to see what this so-called "Yan Gao Yuefu" is like today.

The inside and outside of the door are two different worlds. Coming from the silent, dead streets in the cold wind, it is simply impossible to imagine that in this sleeping Shanghai there is such a near-crazy place. When a lady holds the arm of a gentleman with her slender hands and ascends the stairs, it is difficult to imagine when they are caught in the rain from the rickshaw.

The lively atmosphere in the upstairs dance hall is no less than in previous years. Christmas flowers are blooming in silver vases, gentlemen and ladies put on paper crowns and smile affectionately, forgetting the current situation. The dancers dress up flamboyantly, hoping to earn more dance tickets during this rare "special holiday." The foreign musicians display all their skills, hoping to win the favor of the VIPs. Smoke and alcohol weave the dance floor into a veil. In every corner, a flash of silver light occasionally appears. It turns out that gentlemen and ladies are using flashbulbs to leave a trace of their love and friendship in this fleeting opportunity of joy.

The three strings of balloons hanging from the ceiling are symbols of the dancers' hope and happiness. No one knows when these balloons will be taken down, but everyone pays attention to them at all times. The slightest movement of the balloons causes the dance floor to become congested. Standing in the middle, waiting for "happiness" to descend, but what is gained is several disappointments.

Joy is short-lived. Time is quietly slipping away. When one suddenly realizes the passage of time in the crazy joy woven by smoke, alcohol, music, flattering smiles, thighs, and red lips, gentlemen and ladies exchange opinions in a regretful tone,

"What, let's go? It's already eleven thirty."

The one who didn't believe it looked at his own watch and said reluctantly: "We can sit for another quarter of an hour."

At this time, the balloons came down, and the gentlemen revealed their original nature. The balloons touched each other in their hands, and then were gently patted and raised again, and finally shattered in the scramble, making a snapping sound. So the gentlemen and ladies wearing low crowns shattered their hopes and happiness. After watching two performances, the smoke, alcohol, music, flattering smiles, and red lips were no longer as stimulating as before. Then the Public Works Bureau's notice that "the closing time should be limited to 2:00 AM" revived in the memories of the gentlemen, and the dancers gradually diminished.

"Even in the most joyful times, the dark shadow in the heart cannot be erased." I thought that forgetting oneself is not an easy thing either, and I stood up.

The rain outside the door was still falling pattering. At least one hundred rickshaws gathered at the entrance.

Shanghai is still sleeping, perhaps sleeping even more deeply.

Entertainment Circle

### Sun Min in the Film Industry

— Xiepu Ke

Sun Min, a fellow townsman of Naiyi, is one of the actors who has recently begun to stand out for his portrayal of young men in the film industry. He is a typical "pretty boy" with a sly smile. He is truly like an elegant and refined young master. His personality is particularly suited to playing "纨绔子弟" (playboys), and one often sees him flirting and teasing in Star Film productions!

He is from Shiganwan, Wuxi, Naiyi. Speaking of Sun Jun's childhood stories, they are quite amusing and show that Sun Jun had an interest in art from a young age.

He was playful and endearing as a child! He once studied at Donglin School in Wuxi. After graduating, his parents planned for him to learn commerce, but he always avoided it, failing at everything. His parents had no choice but to let him enter the "circle of life" on his own. Because of his lively and active personality, he aspired to roam freely. He was willing to abandon industry and commerce and devote himself to the film industry. He initially worked as a young actor at Dayi Company, founded by the Shao Zuiweng brothers, and then transferred to Star Company. His skills improved rapidly, quickly catching up with Jin Yan, Wang Yin, Gao Zhanfei, Gong Jianong, and others!

The writer has disturbed his "family lunch" at his residence several times. The cooking of his Changzhou wife was perfectly suited to the Naiyi palate and was very delicious. The fragrance still lingers to this day. I haven't seen him since the incident, and I can't help but feel a sense of longing!

### Trends in the Art World

— Yi

According to an authority in the film industry: It is expected that all film companies in this city will be forced to close in February next year. The shortage of film stock is one reason, but the main reason is that the sale of domestic films to the South Seas has always accounted for over 40% of total revenue. Now, transportation has been cut off and the area has been included in the war zone. Furthermore, since the implementation of earlier closing times for entertainment venues and public transportation in this city, business has decreased by half compared to before January 28th. Under the current circumstances, where human and material resources are twice as expensive as before, the companies will inevitably lose a lot of capital and have no choice but to close down.

Some days ago, Mr. Fen Yu reported that Queen of Bengbeng Opera, Bai Yushuang, would come to Shanghai to perform, but a friend from Tianjin brought reliable news that Bai Ling is suffering from a severe venereal disease and is receiving treatment in a hospital in that city. It is feared that she will not recover for some time.

The Tianfeng Drama Society suddenly dismissed more than ten members last week. The reason is unknown. The new play "Plum Blossom Dream" is a Qing dynasty costume drama, and the capital invested is no less than the sensational drama "Grievances of the Qing Palace."

Recently, amateur drama societies in this city have been exceptionally active. They are all rushing to rehearse new plays, which will be staged successively during the Lunar New Year. These include the Canghai Drama Society's "The Beauty Trap," the Shengchi Drama Society's "Ten Thousand Miles Return," the Xuanduo Drama Society's "Sleepless City," the Yemo Drama Society's "A Way Out," and the Yixing Drama Society's historical drama "Paint Your Body and Swallow Charcoal."

### Rushing to Film "Fallen Plum Blossoms": Wang Xichun Boards at Hualian Factory

— Bei Shi

Dacheng Factory and Hualian Factory have been cooperating in terms of manpower and resources for a long time. Since "New Fisherman's Song" and "The Fragrance of Home Flowers" were completed and released, Dacheng Factory took a temporary rest, and now they are working actively again. In this period, they are filming two films: one is "Wedding Night in the Bridal Chamber," directed by Zhu Shilin and starring Chen Yanyan and He Bin; and the other is "Fallen Plum Blossoms," written by Tu Guangqi, co-directed by Zhu Shilin and Tu Guangqi, and starring Wang Xichun.

In order to speed up the work, they plan to rush to film "Fallen Plum Blossoms" in a short period of time, and to prevent changes in the middle, all the actors and workers in "Fallen Plum Blossoms" are boarding at Hualian Factory. Therefore, Wang Xichun also bid farewell to her room on the upper floor of the International Photo Studio and moved to the triangle area in Xujiahui yesterday.

Hualian Factory is located in the suburbs of Shanghai, where the scenery is excellent and the air is fresh. Therefore, Wang Xichun and others said that being able to take a break from the city and live in that natural sanatorium can help with their health!

The Music Education Association, in order to discover and promote musical talents widely, has specially established courses in composition, singing, violin, piano, etc., and is recruiting free students. The number of applicants has exceeded the limit in recent days. It is reported that the association, at the request of the majority of music students, has decided to hire more professors and expand the number of students. Anyone who is interested in learning music can register at the Yongyu Qin Hang, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Mahe Road.

### Blood Rain and Precious Flowers

Chapter 20: Welcoming the Candlelight on the Battlefield

When Chen Yuanyuan saw San Gui, she couldn't help but cry with joy, and said in a trembling voice: "General Wu, things are unpredictable, and disaster has befallen us. After we parted, who would have thought that I would encounter such a great catastrophe. I almost thought I would never see the General again in this life." As she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes. San Gui reached out and held her soft hand, not knowing what to say to comfort her, but said: "When I received the bad news outside Shanhaiguan that you had been seized, I couldn't sleep or eat, and worried day and night. I wished I had wings to fly to your side and rescue you from danger, so I vowed to send troops to suppress the bandits and rescue my beloved. Fortunately, the Qing soldiers were able to abandon their grievances and help me drive away the rebels. But when I arrived in the capital, I couldn't find any news about you, and I was very anxious. I was afraid that the rebel leader had taken you away, so I quickly pursued them. Heaven is kind, you stayed in the capital and didn't leave. This is also our fate as husband and wife, that we can repair the broken mirror." Yuanyuan was very moved by San Gui's words, and just shed tears. San Gui then asked her to get out of the carriage and sit in the precious carriage he had prepared to welcome her. The carriage was filled with a strange fragrance, making it fragrant and sweet. He himself sat in the carriage with Yuanyuan, and the drums and music played, and the flags were arranged in rows, surrounding them in front and behind, all the way back to the brocade tent. San Gui said to Yuanyuan in the carriage: "I recognized your beautiful appearance in Tian's residence before, and I was amazed by your celestial beauty. Fortunately, Tian Wan agreed to give you to me, and I carried you back in a jeweled carriage. Who knew that just as I was realizing my beautiful dream, I had to sing a farewell song? I had just left the pass, and the capital had already been captured by the rebels? At that time, when I received the news that my family property had been confiscated, I thought that the wealth that came unexpectedly was not worth cherishing. As long as I returned to the capital, it would not be difficult to take it back. Later, when I heard that my father had been killed, I was not very worried, because he could not die for his country, and besides, he had already surrendered to Li Zicheng, and he could be pardoned sooner or later. At that time, he was still writing a letter to recruit me to surrender, and I was still a little hesitant in my heart. But as soon as I heard the bad news that you had been captured by the bandits, I vowed not to stand with the bandit Li, and I must take back my beloved, so that I would have no regrets. Today, my wish has finally come true, and the pearl has been returned. How can I not be overjoyed? But I don't know how you endured these difficult days after you fell into the hands of the bandits, and why Li Zicheng didn't take you away when he left. Isn't this God's will to bring us together again?" (249)

"Waterloo Bridge" is a E Hwa's artistic blockbuster. The picture shows Li Li and Qi Chong's expressions.
