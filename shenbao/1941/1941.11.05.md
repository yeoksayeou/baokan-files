### The Sino-Japanese War Remains Unresolved; Japan Unlikely to Invade Siberia; Japan Increases Troops in Vietnam, Aiming to Spy on Kunming, Yunnan Province; Elite Chinese Forces Move South to Defend the Burma Road

Chongqing: According to well-informed domestic and foreign sources, following the passage of the emergency military budget by the Japanese Diet on November 15th, Japanese troops in Shanxi Province are expected to cross the Yellow River and spy on Xi'an. Japanese troops in Vietnam are expected to move north to spy on Kunming, aiming to cut off China's main supply lines, namely the Burma Road and the Northwest Highway. Regardless of any changes in the Battle of Moscow, Japan will not invade Siberia due to two main reasons: (1) the level of mechanization of the Japanese army is far inferior to that of the Soviet Far East Army; (2) Japan needs 1.5 million troops for this campaign, but with the war against China still ongoing, Japan cannot mobilize this number. In addition, Japan's current financial position cannot sustain such a major campaign. At the same time, Japan does not dare to launch operations in the South Pacific due to the strong defenses of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, and does not want to risk war with Britain and the United States. Therefore, the only path Japan can take is to attempt to end the situation through military action.

China Incident

Previously, several Japanese cabinets had also announced their intention to end the China Incident as soon as possible. The Konoe cabinet even attempted to achieve this through political and economic means, while focusing all efforts on reorganizing Japan's own political and economic institutions. However, it ultimately failed. Therefore, the effect of Tojo's statement that he is determined to end the China Incident as soon as possible is predictable. The main purpose of this special session of the Japanese Diet is to pass a special budget for the war against China. The current budget of 4.8 billion yuan is only enough to maintain the status quo of the Japanese army in China. The Japanese government wants to take new military actions, so it must ask the Diet to

Continue to Allocate Military Funds. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese government has convened special Diet sessions twice to pass special budgets for the invasion of Nanjing and Hankou. It is now believed that Japan will send at least eight divisions from Vietnam to invade Kunming. The number of Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam was originally 40,000, but has recently increased to 70,000. It is reported that reinforcements are still arriving in Vietnam from Hainan and Guangzhou. It is expected that when the strength of the Japanese army in Vietnam increases to 120,000 or 160,000, they will launch an

Attack on Kunming.

Between Lao Cai and Mengzi, there are continuous mountains and rapid currents, making it extremely difficult to use mechanized troops. However, the area north of Mengzi to Kunming is suitable for such troops. It is now believed that when the Japanese army attacks from northern Vietnam, they will mainly rely on aircraft for assistance. Since the Japanese army occupied Vietnam, elite Chinese troops have been stationed along the Yunnan-Guangxi border to prevent accidents. Reuters has learned that large numbers of Chinese reinforcements are now moving south to protect the Burma Road. Many well-informed observers here believe that the future Battle of Kunming is likely to be the most important battle of the Sino-Japanese War, or even the final major battle.

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Chinese army here announced last night that the Japanese army has concentrated 80,000 troops in Vietnam, but it is not yet known whether they will advance south or

Invade Yunnan.

The spokesman said that the Japanese army authorities took over the French government and administrative organs in Hanoi on November 1st, and are still taking over other places. The Japanese army has also completed the occupation of all railway and highway areas in Vietnam. The Japanese army is now being transferred from Haiphong to Hanoi, and from Hainan to Saigon. An independent operational unit, including tanks, artillery, machine guns, and transportation units, is stationed in Lao Cai. Regarding the Japanese announcement of an attack north of Xinyang, Henan Province, the spokesman replied, "I believe this move is not

Particularly Important

because it is not a concerted attack launched westward from Zhengzhou, and only a small number of troops are currently participating in the attack." The spokesman also said that he had received reports that 20,000 Japanese troops were concentrated at Humen, between Hong Kong and Guangzhou on the Pearl River, apparently waiting for ships to be transferred elsewhere. The spokesman said that in the second half of October, the Japanese army's movements in Vietnam included the transfer of 10,000 troops from Saigon to Hanoi, and the transfer of an equal number of troops from Hainan to Haiphong.

Five Thousand Japanese Troops

were transferred to locations close to the Guangxi border, such as Lang Son and Cao Bang. The Japanese army is expanding the An Fei airfield southeast of Lao Cai, and adding machinery and equipment. 20,000 Japanese troops are stationed between Haiphong and Lao Cai, and are recruiting many farmers in the area to build roads. The spokesman also said that he had received reports that the Japanese were transferring troops to the Burmese border, facing the defenses prepared by the British army. The Japanese authorities have also taken over the French arsenal in Hanoi, which can produce 100 rifles, 2 machine guns, and 10,000 rounds of ammunition per day. (United Press dispatch, 4th)

### Amidst the Emergency of the Pacific Situation, U.S. Naval and Air Force Commanders Arrive; Japan Attempts to Avoid War and Seeks Understanding with the U.S.; Wavell's Visit to Singapore Is of Great Significance

Manila, 4th (United Press): Brigadier General Brereton and Captain Rockwell arrived here today aboard the China Clipper to take up their respective posts as commander of the U.S. Army Air Force in the Philippines and commander of the 16th Naval District. After their arrival, the two immediately met with Lieutenant General MacArthur, commander of the Far East Army.

Washington, 4th (Reuters): The arrival of General Wavell, commander-in-chief of the British forces in India, in Singapore has heightened interest here in events in the Far East. Many people are now wondering why General Wavell would leave the Middle East lightly when the German army appears poised to spy on the Caucasus, unless the situation in the Far East has deteriorated unexpectedly. There is no one here who expects Japan to join the war immediately after Hitler's announcement that the United States has attacked Germany first. Everyone believes that Tokyo will actively use the provisions of the alliance that allow it to evade its obligations, as these provisions allow it to decide when and whether one of the allied countries has been attacked. The New York Times said that Hitler's statement was aimed at opening a door that would allow Japan to participate in an attack on the United States, but has not yet made such a difficult proposal to Japan. The meaning of President Roosevelt's words in his Navy Day speech, "History records who fired the first shot, and in the future, the most important thing will be who fired the last shot," must be well understood by Japan. News from the Japanese official news agency that has reached here states that Tojo will declare to the Diet that there is a time limit for negotiations with the United States. Americans regard this statement as nothing more than a tactic of psychological warfare. As far as is known, the Japanese participants in the talks here have never mentioned a time limit. There is not the slightest sign of appeasement towards Japan here. Various indications prove that the U.S. government is still adhering to the policies it has been pursuing. If Japan wants its talks with the U.S. to make any progress, then withdrawing its troops from China is a difficult hurdle that Japan must overcome. Everyone believes that Japan is eager to find a way to extricate itself from the quagmire it is trapped in in China. Therefore, although withdrawing its troops from China may seem like a negative thing, it is indeed a path that Japan must find for itself. At the same time, Washington officials have always maintained a calm attitude towards the Far East.

London, 4th (Reuters): The Times commented on the situation in the Far East, saying that people here generally feel that Japan has no intention of advancing south or attacking north at present, and expect that Tokyo may not act according to Hitler's suggestion that the United States has attacked Germany and Japan should attack the United States. The newspaper also said that it is also believed here that the sudden arrival of General Wavell, commander-in-chief of the British forces in India, in Singapore may have a good psychological impact on Tokyo.

Washington, 4th (United Press): A senior government official said last night that although Tokyo has issued warnings, the United States will not comply with "time limits" in the current talks with Japan. He said that the U.S. government will not comply with the alleged ultimatums, nor will it withdraw its consistent stance on the Far East. The official pointed out that Japan launched these talks to avoid conflict in the Pacific. He said that the United States has expressed its willingness to avoid naval conflict in the Pacific. The United States will not abandon the interests of China, the Netherlands, and Britain. The governments of those countries have received assurances about the intentions of the United States after they expressed their fears about the U.S.-Japan talks. He added that the United States insists on emphasizing that it is only conducting "talks" and not "negotiations." In fact, U.S. officials hope that the result of these talks will be nothing more than a diplomatic "timeout." The official said that Japan's new threats and warnings are believed to be due to pressure from Berlin. It is not believed here that Japan intends to truly engage in war until Japan deeply believes that the democratic countries in Europe have been completely defeated.

Washington, 4th (International News Service): According to news from various parts of the Far East received by the State Department, it is increasingly believed that Japan is planning to find a "compromise solution" with the United States regarding the Pacific problem. The possibility of a comprehensive understanding with the United States, which is currently at a stalemate, is being discussed. Tokyo is also considering whether to conclude a limited agreement with the United States in order to avoid an early break with the United States while restoring U.S. oil shipments to Japan. Well-informed sources believe that Japan's limited agreement proposal will include the following key points: (1) The U.S. should restore normal commerce with Japan, especially restore oil shipments to Japan; (2) In return, Japan will "ignore" Berlin's accusation that the U.S. attacked Germany in a recent naval battle, and the danger of Japan participating in the war on the side of the Axis powers will be immediately eliminated; (3) Japan will not interfere with the interests of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands in the South Pacific.

Tokyo Newspapers Filled with Anti-American Sentiment, Demanding Government Break the Encirclement

Tokyo, 4th (United Press): Tokyo newspapers today continue to express anti-American sentiment and declare in the same tone that the Diet, which is about to open, must inspire the public spirit to destroy the ABCD encirclement. The newspapers argue that the Diet's greatest mission is to awaken the people, destroy the encirclement of hostile countries, so as to end the China Incident and build the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The newspapers also say that, for this reason, Prime Minister Tojo will deliver a speech at the opening of the Diet, frankly and openly explaining the current situation, and reporting on the progress of the Washington talks and the government's determination to take countermeasures. They also say that General Tojo's speech will not only be valued domestically, but will also be closely watched by the whole world, because it is believed that the speech is of great importance to the international political situation. The newspapers also say that the government is drafting the speech with great caution. Although yesterday was a national holiday, four cabinet officials devoted themselves to drafting the speech for three hours. The speech is expected to be submitted to the cabinet for review next week. The newspapers also predict the content of Tojo's speech in the same tone. The Asahi Shimbun wrote an editorial in its consistent style, explaining the new way for Japan to implement its national policy, saying that resolving the China Incident and establishing the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" are Japan's unshakable national policies. The Asahi Shimbun also said, "In order to achieve the great goal, Japan must improve its relations with friendly countries, so as to complete the national affairs organization system at home and abroad. Based on this supreme wartime front, Japan can take a stern attitude towards the enemy countries and promote its own national policy for self-defense and for the survival of the Far East."

### Japan Avoids Explaining Who Fired First in German-U.S. Conflict; Ishii Says He Has Not Received Detailed Information; Maintains Independent View on Alliance

Tokyo, 4th (Reuters): When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii greeted foreign reporters as usual on Tuesday morning, he was asked whether Japan agreed with Germany's statement that the United States had attacked Germany first. Ishii replied that Japan is now exercising its own independent opinion and that the question of implementing Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact has not yet been mentioned. Japan has not yet received detailed information on the maritime conflict between Germany and the United States. Ishii went on to say that when a certain Japanese ship was about to leave San Francisco, the U.S. Treasury Department demanded to inspect certain types of mail on board, which was extremely unpleasant. As to whether this action was justified, he was not entirely sure, but the U.S. authorities should not have done this hastily, causing the ship to leave the mail behind. Ishii also answered another question, saying that the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington have not stopped, but since the formation of the Tojo Cabinet, the two sides have only met once. When asked whether the increased anti-American movement in Japanese newspapers reflected the government's attitude, Ishii declined to answer, but said that what the newspapers expressed was their own opinion, but it did reflect the opinion of the majority of the Japanese people.

### Japanese Government to Explain Policies

Tokyo, 4th (Reuters): The Provisional Cabinet Meeting has decided to hold a session on November 24th, following the end of the extraordinary session of the Diet. Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Togo, Navy Minister Shimada, Finance Minister Kaya, and other cabinet members will attend and explain in detail the government's military, diplomatic, and economic policies.

### U.S. Islands in the Pacific Evacuate Women and Children; Japanese Residents Evacuate Singapore

Honolulu, 4th (Havas):

According to British sources, American women and children on Guam and Midway Island in the Pacific have been evacuated due to the current situation.

Singapore, 4th (United Press): It was learned today that 498 Japanese people have reserved berths on the Asama Maru, which is scheduled to arrive here around November 15th. Consul General Tsurumi will also evacuate.

### Tokyo Broadcasts Warning to Thailand

Singapore, 4th (Reuters): A Thai-language broadcast from Tokyo was heard here today, warning Thailand that its situation is even worse than China's was when the Sino-Japanese War broke out. While Japan admires Thailand's efforts to build its nation, it feels that its dependence on various countries, especially Britain and the United States, for supplies poses a serious danger. If this situation continues, Thailand's nationalism may suffer the same fate as the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek, leading it to regard Japan as its enemy and cooperate with Britain and the United States.

### British Empire Considers Changing Attitude Toward Japan

Currently in Consultation with Various Autonomous Territories; Duff Cooper Arrives in Australia for Observation

Reuters, Canberra, 4th – Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated here today that the British Empire is now considering changing its attitude towards Japan. The UK is currently consulting with its autonomous territories regarding the attitude to be adopted towards Japan. This consultation includes considerations beyond the scope of Europe. At the same time, Overseas Australian Army Commander General Blamey will arrive in Australia next week to consult with the War Cabinet and the War Executive Committee.

Havas, Batavia, 3rd – British government's Special Commissioner for the Far East, Duff Cooper, traveled by plane to the Commonwealth of Australia today for inspection. Before his departure, he stated in a speech that after arriving in Sydney, Commonwealth of Australia, he would proceed to the Dominion of New Zealand to study the administrative adjustments of the Far Eastern territories.

Havas, New York, 4th – According to Dutch East Indies official sources, the American "Catalina" type military aircraft will soon be transported there. This aircraft can fly from Batavia to Taiwan and then fly back without landing.

### War Approaches India; Britain Concerned about Indian Political Situation; Burmese Prime Minister Active in London, Demanding Post-War Autonomous Status

Reuters, London, 4th – "New Statesman" newspaper published an article titled "War Approaches India," discussing the Indian political situation related to the war. It stated that it is not surprising that Burmese Prime Minister U Saw is requesting the British government to clearly commit to granting Burma dominion status after the war. If the British government delays or refuses, U Saw has warned that "the consequences will be unpleasant or even dangerous," as Japan has made very agile suggestions. We must know that the Japanese have used Buddhism to establish friendly ties with the Burmese people. In U Saw's way of thinking, the Burmese will see no difference between being in the Japanese co-prosperity sphere and being within the British Empire unless we grant them dominion status. The possibilities contained in the new situation in Asia may well serve as a useful warning to the British government to change its policy. Now, war is approaching India and Burma. If the Soviet Union loses more territory in the Caucasus and near the Caspian Sea, then India will play a crucial role in the final outcome, its significance probably no less than that of many armed divisions. Both sides should urgently approach each other and reach mutual understanding. Delaying a decision is not only unwise but also dangerous. As the war shifts eastward, those affected are no longer just the British Empire. We also know that there is a growing sentiment among young people in India, not only among the pacifists of Gandhism but also leaning towards the left. It is unacceptable for a large country like India to stand passively by in a struggle in which its future and our future are intertwined. Indians residing in Britain, mostly young people and mostly members of the All-India Congress Committee, recently gathered in London and argued that if India could participate with dignity, it should actively support the war effort in various ways. Now, if India truly wants to fight for itself and to defeat totalitarianism, rather than fighting for us or the British King, then it should gladly do so under its own national government. We have never proposed a formal change in the constitution during wartime, only to transform the Governor-General's Executive Council into a national cabinet, and to instruct the Governor-General to regard the Executive Council as the cabinet. There is one more step to be taken, which is to have this national government prepare the procedures for post-war consultation with Britain to implement its self-determination, and Britain should commit to respecting India's decision. In this way, we can hope for India's full cooperation in the war. Britain needs India as its ally as much as it needs the Soviet Union.

### Women in American Peace Movement Demonstrate Against British Ambassador

Reuters, Detroit, 4th –

As British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax went to meet Bishop Mooney today and was entering the building, a number of women holding a peace demonstration threw eggs and tomatoes at him. Police rushed to the scene and dispersed the protesters. Halifax was hit by several eggs before the demonstrators were dispersed. Halifax is here to visit various defense centers for a two-day stay.

### Robin Moor Incident: United States Demands Compensation, Rejected by German Government

Havas, Washington, 4th – After the American ship "Robin Moor" was sunk by a German submarine in August, the U.S. government lodged two protests with Germany and demanded compensation of $2,967,092 for damages. It is now learned that Germany has refused. It is reported that the German Chargé d'Affaires Thomson stated in a reply to Secretary of State Hull, "My government finds it difficult to respond to your two letters."

### German Submarines Active; American Oil Tanker Struck by Torpedo; Incident Location Southwest of Iceland; Although Heavily Damaged, Safely Reached Port; 95 Missing American Crew Members Presumed Dead

Reuters, Washington, 4th – According to the Navy Department, the U.S. Navy oil tanker "Salinas" received a warning and was attacked by a torpedo on the evening of October 29th. The incident location was southwest of Iceland. The ship was heavily damaged but safely reached port. This incident occurred the night before the U.S. destroyer "Reuben James" was sunk. As it was necessary to wait for the ship to reach port safely, the news was not announced immediately. The ship was escorted by warships when it was attacked. Details of the damage have not been released. This is the fourth Sino-American naval vessel to be attacked by torpedoes in two months. The ship has a displacement of 16,800 tons, is equipped with two 5-inch caliber guns, and anti-aircraft guns. There are a total of 107 crew members.

Reuters, Washington, 4th – Yesterday, the Navy Department announced that the seven officers and eighty-eight sailors missing from the U.S. destroyer "Reuben James," which sank near Iceland last week, are presumed dead. A total of forty-five people were rescued, eighteen of whom were injured.

### China Anti-Aggression League Prays for Victory of Democratic Countries, Issues Declaration Demanding Accelerated Aid to China

Chongqing – The China Anti-Aggression League recently issued a declaration praying for the victory of democratic countries, clearly announcing three things to the world: First, the Three Principles of the People are integrated with various progressive ideologies of the world, so their realization is the goal of the Chinese people's efforts and struggles today. Second, the culprits who are destroying world peace today are Nazi Hitler, Fascist Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists. They have formed an axis and want to rule the entire world and enslave the people of the world. If the people of the democratic countries continue to act for their own selfish interests and do not thoroughly awaken and take united action quickly, they will inevitably be defeated by the aggressors. China's resistance to aggression is not only to protect its security, but also for world justice and peace. It is hoped that the democratic countries will provide effective assistance quickly so that victory can come sooner. Third, the two Chinese characters for peace, "和平" (hé píng), mean "peace after leveling." After the last war, Wilson's Fourteen Points were not implemented, which was the root cause of this disaster. Now, the eight principles agreed upon by U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill can be considered important principles that are close to justice, close to the Three Principles of the People, and practically feasible. Therefore, we are willing to work together with the people of all democratic countries to promote their realization. (Havas News Agency, 4th)

### Hong Kong Forms Chinese Defense Corps with Good Results

Hong Kong – The Hong Kong government recruited hundreds of Chinese workers, students, and businessmen to serve as Chinese defense personnel today, demonstrating that Chinese compatriots here are showing responsibility for defending Hong Kong in times of crisis. However, the number recruited today was limited to only fifty. They will be the core of a certain regiment to be established soon (rumored to be a machine gun regiment). After the first fifty pass the examination, another one hundred and fifty will be recruited. The Hong Kong side warmly welcomes the enthusiastic cooperation of the Chinese people and the local defense authorities, and stated that the organization of the Chinese Defense Corps has been approved by the Chinese government. However, the recruitment campaign for defense corps members, which began on the 1st of this month, is still continuing, with 170 applicants already. The work of the defense corps is divided into labor service, transportation, special police, medical care, and firefighting groups. (Chuan Daily News)

### Far East Anti-Aggression Front

Recently, because the possibility of large-scale aggression by Japan is very high, the solidarity of the ABCDR front has been strengthened unprecedentedly. Now everyone sees very clearly that if this front did not exist in the Far East, Japan's northward or southward advance might have already become a reality. However, precisely because the Eastern violent power holds infinite fear for the formation of this front, it is constantly seeking gaps, trying to break through one by one, break through the encirclement, forming the current threatening state of waiting for an opportunity to attack. The only solution for the ABCDR group facing this situation is to strengthen its own unity and cooperation, to use overwhelming force to stop the aggressive forces from taking further risks, and to promote the early arrival of common total victory through close cooperation and assistance. Otherwise, if a considerable gap and weakness appear in a certain point or aspect, then it is only natural for the aggressor to take the opportunity to act, and the outbreak of war in the Pacific Ocean will become an inevitable deduction.

The factual formation of the ABCDR front has been repeatedly emphasized by the authoritative authorities of various countries today. Its existence has been unanimously recognized by all observers. However, formally, it has not gone through the formalities and documents of an alliance, and in the process of its creation, it is entirely a historical product following a gradual procedure, unlike the German-Japanese-Italian alliance, which suddenly announced their alliance relationship to the world with a piece of legislation. Tracing back to the root, its emergence is entirely due to the situation of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance gradually created. Therefore, its spirit is really spread to all anti-aggression countries in the world, and in its application, there is no question of treating the Eastern and Western groups separately. However, because of the geographical relationship and the historical background of its emergence, the largest object of its application today is obviously still focused on the Far East, this is one; and given that Japan is loudly advocating southward and northward advances, and is simultaneously hostile to all ABCDR countries, it is only natural that they have to unite together to jointly resist Japan, this is two. However, the Japanese side's claim that the biggest purpose of the ABCDR group is to surround Japan is completely inconsistent with reality and contradictory. The target they are surrounding is aggressive actions, the so-called Greater East Asia New Order, and the violent spirit and psychology that produces such actions and policies, and is not limited to a specific country. Regarding this, as long as we briefly review the process of participation of various countries in this front, then we can immediately understand.

First, let’s talk about China. Due to the result of its four years of strong and hard fighting, and due to the special importance of its geographical location, there is no doubt that it is the largest pillar of this group. However, in the early stage of China's war, even before Germany, Italy, and Japan formally formed an alliance last September, China's diplomatic policy has always followed a very cautious path. On the positive side, it avoided any alliance-like relationship with any friendly allies, so that it would not drag itself into the whirlpool of other international disputes, only shouting that all those who help China fight and do not hinder China's struggle are China's good friends. On the negative side, it also tried its best not to offend any country that echoed Japan. However, this basic position was greatly shaken when Germany, Italy, and Japan formally formed an alliance last year and mutually recognized each other's so-called "new order." Since this spring, the mutual alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has attempted to obstruct British and American assistance to China, and it has further convinced the Chinese authorities. Therefore, on the eve of Foreign Minister Guo's return home to take office, he pointed out for the first time in London the necessity of full cooperation between the ABC countries. When the conditions for the formation of the ABCDR group were fully mature after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Germany and Italy suddenly recognized the results of Japan's aggressive actions and despised the existence of China's legitimate sovereignty, which prompted China to take the step of full membership. And from the recent statements of China's top authorities, we can know that China is now completely standing on this front and engaging in resolute struggle.

Next are Britain and the United States. Until July last year, when Britain agreed to Japan's blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Highway for three months, its basic diplomatic policy was still stagnating at the stage of treating the Eastern and Western aggressors separately. Germany, Italy, and Japan formally formed an alliance, and cooperated to establish a new order, and it suddenly woke up and realized that it was one of the targets on both sides at the same time. In early spring and May this year, Japan's repeated echo of the German and Italian offensives and the brewing of actions in the East made Britain realize that taking the most resolute stance in the Far East and its operations in Europe were equally important for the survival of its empire. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Britain and the Soviet Union immediately formed an alliance, so that Japan would have to confront Britain head-on whether it advanced south or north. In addition, the United States, for the past year, has moved from a position of aiding China and Britain to aiding China, Britain, and the Soviet Union; from the attitude of a third-party aid to the spirit of not hesitating to fight a war now. All of this has completely determined the status of Britain and the United States in this front.

Again, the Soviet Union. Until recently, we have not heard its expression on this front. However, in international relations, it is an ally with Britain, and the most reliable friendly country that has shared weal and woe with China for four years; and in the past record, it has had several glorious achievements such as Zhanggufeng and Nomunhan. The Soviet Union is a country that emphasizes action and does not advocate empty words, so there is of course no doubt about its position in this front.

Finally, adding the Dutch East Indies, which has a very clear attitude, thus, this constitutes the strong ABCDR front in the Far East today.

### Roosevelt-Churchill: The Beginning and End of the Atlantic Meeting (3)

On the morning of the day we met the convoy, HMS Prince of Wales was visited by the Prime Minister and his party to observe a live ammunition exercise with anti-aircraft guns. First, a smoke bomb was launched and exploded high in the air, turning into a cloud of black smoke, then it was used as a target, and the anti-aircraft guns were opened, and flowering shells bloomed around the smoke. Finally, all the anti-aircraft guns on the ship were opened together to form a barrage of fire. The two sides of the battleship seemed to be constantly in flames, and the intensity of the firepower made the air around the ship black with smoke. It is hard to believe that a warship can fire such a fierce barrage of fire.

Churchill landed at a port in Scotland and immediately took the overnight train back to London. When he drove into the station the next morning, the platform was crowded with hundreds of welcoming civil and military officials. When Churchill's round body stepped out of the special car, the people on the platform cheered in unison.

Mrs. Churchill hurried down the platform. The Lord Privy Seal Attlee and the Lord President of the Council Anderson, one thin and one fat, followed closely behind. Churchill grinned and watched them approach, then embraced her tightly and gave her a kiss.

Churchill returned to the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, immediately convened a special meeting of the War Cabinet, reported to the cabinet members in detail, and then drove to Buckingham Palace to see King George VI and present President Roosevelt's reply.

Two days later, Churchill broadcast to the country and abroad, reporting on the situation of this maritime meeting. In ten years, his public speeches had rarely been more fluent than this one. He began confidently, "I think you must want me to report on my trip across the ocean and my meeting with our great friend, the President of the United States... In a vast bay surrounded by land, the powerful American fleet, protected by many small ships and long-range aircraft, waited for our arrival and seemed to reach out to lead us in...

"President Roosevelt and I stayed there cordially for three days. At the same time, the Chiefs of Staff and the commanders of the Army and Navy of the United Kingdom and the United States sat aside and held meetings together. "When the President and I held meetings at sea, we had the understanding that we did not want to prescribe a formal and final peace policy or combat goals, but we must formulate a concise wartime declaration to serve as the guideline for the future operations of the United Kingdom and the United States.

### Moscow Front: Unprecedented Great Bloody Battle Occurs; Germany Pours All Its Strength into Re-Attacking Soviet Capital; Southern Route: Germany Peeks at Sevastopol

International News Agency, Berlin, 4th – Local officials stated yesterday that Rostov, an important Soviet industrial center and gateway to the Caucasus oil fields, will soon fall into the hands of the German army. At the same time, they also stated that a large-scale offensive against the Caucasus has been launched. It is claimed that the recent attack on Crimea is the preliminary stage of the attack on the Caucasus. Most of this small island protruding south into the Black Sea has been invaded by the German army. Stuka dive bombers are currently bombarding Soviet mountain positions at the southern end of Crimea. Although Soviet resistance is very fierce, it has not prevented the German army from advancing. Various German bombers are also continuing to bomb Sevastopol, the major naval base in Crimea, destroying a large number of ships there and along the coast. Officials announced that more than fourteen Soviet divisions stationed on Crimea failed to stop the German army from advancing, and these Soviet troops are about to be eliminated. Since the German air force launched a full-scale offensive against the Soviet port of Novorossiysk, the war has actually extended to the Caucasus. German military commentators said that the German air force has sounded the death knell for the remnants of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. They also said that the German army is advancing very quickly because it has the experience of the First World War.

International News Agency, Kuybyshev, 4th – An unprecedented great bloody battle in history is currently taking place on the Moscow front. At the same time, the German army is mobilizing fresh reserve troops, wielding tanks and artillery, and pouring all its strength into re-attacking the Soviet capital. The situation in Crimea and Rostov is critical, so Soviet officials are paying close attention to the central and southern routes. (London Daily Express yesterday published a dispatch from the Swedish capital saying that 400 German planes bombed the Soviet capital for half an hour.)

Havas News Agency, New York, 4th – According to Soviet sources, 200,000 fresh Red Army troops have been dispatched to the Moscow front. It is heard that these reinforcements were drawn from reserve troops in the rear.

Reuters, London, 4th – According to news received here, the battles on various fronts in the Soviet territory have become more intense again. There are signs that the long-awaited new German offensive against Moscow has been launched. The severe cold has made the ground on the front line in that area hard. The German army has repeatedly attacked along the arc line from Bely to Tula, but has been repelled by the Soviet army.

Reuters, London, 4th – It is reported that the German army is currently attacking Sevastopol (southwestern Crimea), an important base of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. Recent Soviet communiqués confirmed that there are wars in the peninsula and Kalinin (100 miles northwest of Moscow). At the same time, unconfirmed news from Helsinki spread that seven Soviet warships have broken out of the mine area in the Gulf of Finland and sailed west. This statement has not been confirmed by any party. The Swedish Aftonbladet published a Berlin dispatch stating that the German army is currently advancing towards Sevastopol. The German side attaches great importance to the Crimean war because the German army can peep into the Caucasus from the peninsula. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a midnight communiqué stating that on November 3, our army fought against the enemy along the entire front, and the battles on the Crimean and Kalinin fronts were very fierce. On November 2, 13 German planes were destroyed, and 3 Soviet planes were also lost. On November 3, two German planes were shot down near Moscow. Reuters military commentators analyzed the Soviet war situation and said that the Germans are an unusually docile people, otherwise they would not be satisfied with the current results and would call for the results promised by the authorities. All Germans want to get Moscow, and Hitler has promised this. Day after day, the Germans hear news of victories everywhere on the northern, southern, and central routes, but Moscow is never mentioned. According to the German side, three weeks ago, it claimed that the Soviet army on the Moscow front had been cleared. At the same time, German casualties have increased unabated and suffered from the cold, which is well known to the Germans. The German army around Moscow has not advanced within fifty miles except in Mozhaisk.

Associated Press, Kuybyshev, 4th – Yesterday, local officials said that the German air force is constantly bombing Moscow. The news said that German planes are carrying out four or five air raids every day, but the losses to military targets are very small. Since the beginning of the war, Moscow has shot down 400 German planes, including 36 last Wednesday.

Expansion of German Black Sea Power: The Tatar Strait Becomes Increasingly Important

Reuters, London, 4th – With Sevastopol now under imminent threat, the Tatar Strait has once again become critically important. Its importance to the countries along the Black Sea is no less than that of Gibraltar to the Mediterranean. If the Soviet Union's Black Sea pressure forces it to enter the Black Sea and challenge the Soviet navy, but Germany's recent rapid advances may not embarrass Turkey anymore. Germany may now simultaneously and firmly demand that Turkey not allow the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to escape from the Tatar Strait. In this environment, unless Turkey interprets the above-mentioned terms to allow the Soviet fleet to sail to bases in Vladivostok or Arkhangelsk, the Montreux Convention may eventually be used as a tool against the Soviet Union. If this kind of emergency situation occurs, Turkey will risk a direct conflict with Germany.

### Hull Advises Finland: Seek Peace with the Soviets, or You Cannot Maintain American Friendship; Reportedly Finland's Reply to the US is About to be Submitted

Reuters, Washington, 4th - Secretary of State Hull, while receiving newspaper reporters, said that the United States has warned Finland that if it wishes to maintain American friendship, it must quickly cease its military actions against the Soviet Union. A reporter asked if it was true, as rumored from London, that Britain had delayed declaring war on Finland due to American opposition, which he said was completely unfounded. Hull replied that the US government had repeatedly called the Finnish government's attention to the concerns arising from the course the United States had taken toward Finland. According to Dow Jones News Service, Hull stated that the United States had dispatched a note to the Finnish government, warning it that Finland must promptly withdraw its battlefield troops and consider peace talks to maintain friendly relations between the US and Finland. Hull stated, "Instructions have recently been issued to the Minister to Finland to inform the Finnish government that if Finland wishes to maintain friendship with the United States, it must provide satisfactory evidence to show that Finland wishes to promptly cease its military offensive actions against the Soviet Union, and in principle will promptly withdraw Finnish troops. At the same time, the US Minister again presented to the Finnish government the information previously submitted to the Finnish Minister to the United States regarding the possibility of a peaceful resolution of various outstanding issues between Finland and the Soviet Union. The United States is now awaiting a reply from the Finnish government. It was noted that on August 18th, the Finnish Minister to the United States was informed by the US State Department that the Soviet Union was prepared to discuss a Finnish-Soviet peace agreement on the basis of compensating Finland with land. However, to date, neither Finnish officials in Helsinki nor spokespersons in the United States have indicated any intention to study this possibility. The United States is certainly aware that Finland is currently under pressure from Germany, and seeking peace with the Soviet Union may be difficult. However, Finland knows that its current government poses a threat to the independence and security of all anti-Nazi countries in the world, including Finland itself. If it continues its current policy, it is solely because the current Finnish government is no longer a free administrative body for the Finnish people, or because this policy is not freely chosen by the Finnish government and people."

United Press, Stockholm, 4th - A Finnish official news agency dispatch from Helsinki yesterday, from reliable sources, stated that the Finnish government has received a note from the United States regarding Finnish-Soviet peace negotiations. The news agency stated that Finland's reply could be issued recently.

Reuters, Washington, 4th - Secretary of State Hull's comments yesterday regarding Finland were quite clear. Well-informed sources have long known that Hull's patience with the Finnish government and public is waning. Finnish spokespersons have said much, but the State Department now wants to see action. Finnish Prime Minister Tanner's conversation with a New York Times reporter, denying any connection between Finland and the Nazis, was followed within hours by Hull's reprimand, which can truly be called a severe condemnation. Finland's failure to utilize the possibility of peace with the Soviet Union in August has created a negative impact in US official circles. While Americans do not wish to fight against the Finnish people, many believe that Hull's words imply that if Finland does not provide assurances on this demand, the United States will support Britain's declaration of war on Finland.

### Two US Submarines Transferred to British and Polish Navies

Reuters, New London, 4th - In a ceremony held here today, two US submarines were transferred to the British and Polish navies, respectively. According to Colonel Cronan, commander of the New London submarine base, the one transferred to the British is a 600-ton R-class submarine, and the one transferred to Poland is an 800-ton S-class submarine. These two submarines are the first batch of submarines transferred to belligerent nations under the Lend-Lease Act. While these two vessels were being refitted, British and Polish crew members have been stationed here for some time, and will practice on similar submarines. The submarine transferred to Britain was built in 1918, while the other was built in 1921.

### Bureau Rice Sold Sparsely; Rice Shops Adopt Shuttle Tactics; Only Two Seen Selling After a Long Distance

The sale of rice by the Bureau of Public Works is still sporadic. Very few rice shops are seen with signs indicating the sale of Bureau rice. This morning, from Avenue Edward VII, Quai de Card, along Route Cardinal Foch, Avenue du Roi Albert, Avenue Joffre, Rue Massenet, all the way to Avenue Foch, only two were seen selling Bureau rice: one at the entrance of Kwang Jen Li on Avenue Edward VII, and the other at the intersection of Route Cardinal Foch and Avenue du Roi Albert. The people buying rice at both locations were densely packed, front to back, pressed so tightly that many were short of breath. At around 8:30 in the morning, in front of the Brothers Barber Shop on Avenue du Roi Albert, two middle-aged and elderly people and three women and children in the rice queue were attacked from both front and back, and were squeezed out of the line, falling to the ground. Stronger people took the opportunity to join the line. These five people had to push and shove for quite some time before they could rejoin the line. There were also people in the front of the line who were forcibly dragged out by those who came later, who then occupied their positions. Those who were dragged out were beaten when they tried to rejoin. Until around 11 o'clock, the rice shops had already stopped selling, and those waiting in line on the sidewalk still had numbers written on their coats in chalk, numbering more than five hundred. Hungry and empty-bellied, but the rice was still in the rice shop, and the rice shop was resting. Returning to Avenue Edward VII, a sign was seen posted at the rice shop stating that the imported rice from Hong Kong was sold out, and those waiting in line inside the barbed wire fence still stretched into Kwang Jen Li. It is only when life reaches this point that one realizes that eating is the most difficult thing. It's all about wanting to buy Bureau rice because it is slightly cheaper, but who would have thought that Bureau rice is also hard to get. How can the general working class afford this kind of treatment if they want to buy it? Rice shops are adopting shuttle tactics for selling their own rice, otherwise, why would only two shops be selling Bureau rice after such a long journey? However, it also shows the extent of the supply of Bureau rice. There were a few rhyming verses on the spot as proof:

To buy a measure of rice,
One must rise early at dawn.
Who knew when the sun is near noon,
The pot is still empty and moans.

Fortunately, the Bureau of Public Works' affordable imported rice is still arriving continuously. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 10,200 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong. Also, the Chongqing Wheel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying 10,200 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong. They docked at the French Concession's Hong Kong Wharf for unloading. The two ships together carried 20,400 bags, all of which were the Bureau of Public Works' affordable small-sized imported rice. Furthermore, the Chongqing Wheel also had 2,400 bags of imported rice, scheduled to be shipped to Tianjin on the same ship within the next few days. (Zu)

The imported rice market has eased slightly. As gold prices have fallen, customers are no longer hoarding as eagerly as before. Moreover, after the inspection by the Bureau of Public Works, the rice industry associations have repeatedly advised restraint. Some speculators have slightly receded, and many scattered households have slightly released their hoards. Therefore, after an initial boost in the morning market, prices gradually returned to normal. Small-sized rice was once as high as 174.5 yuan, but later settled to 172-173 yuan. Ying Wah Sze's small-sized rice once opened at a high price of 206 yuan, but there were few takers. However, there are still a few market bullies trying to push up prices, so although the market atmosphere is calm, the prices are still chaotic. The total transaction volume of ready rice in the city was more than 10,000 bags, and Ying Wah Sze had 500-600 tons. The market bullies' attempt to shout high prices ultimately failed to materialize. If No. 1 Saigon rice did not see any transactions due to its high price, then there was not much change in general mid-range goods. In the mid-market opening, No. 1 Siam opened at 181 yuan to 180 yuan, No. 2 at 173-174 yuan, small-sized at 173-174 yuan, broken tip at 144 yuan, No. 2 Saigon at 181-182 yuan, and Min Dang was quoted from 190 yuan down to 185 yuan. But later, the buying sentiment was not strong, and gradually softened. As a result, at the close of the market, small-sized rice was only 171-172 yuan to 170 yuan, and foreign warehouses were at 168-169 yuan, down by two to three yuan compared to the previous market.

The total arrival of thick and thin japonica rice was only two to three hundred piculs. Therefore, the sellers in the morning market were quite firm in their intention to sell, and made great efforts to push up prices. Kunshan new japonica rice opened at 207 yuan, Qingjiao kiln seed at 205-206 yuan, and Nangang early break also at 205-206 yuan, an increase of as much as five or six yuan. However, the market softened later, as it saw that imported rice was not expanding and that there was no clear outlet. Therefore, the result was that Nangang early break was at 204 yuan, then down to 202.5 yuan, Kunshan new japonica at 204 yuan, then down to 200 yuan, and Qingjiao kiln seed at 202-203 yuan, an actual increase of only two or three yuan. The rare Sijing wild rice continued to sell tightly at 205-206 yuan. Kunshan new Du Jian, with an arrival of sixty to seventy piculs, opened at 191 yuan to 190.5 yuan.

Glutinous rice, which had no transactions the day before, saw a relatively broader outlet yesterday. Because the sellers were interested in Hong Kong dollars, Hong Kong dollars actually opened at 211-212 yuan, with special grades at 214-215 yuan, soaring by ten yuan or more compared to the week before. Glutinous tea also opened at 191-192 yuan. As for national glutinous rice, it has not been opened.

### Golden Dragon Brand Vermicelli: No Buyer at 60 Yuan

Yesterday, the Grain Guild continued to suspend trading, and there were still no formal transactions for vermicelli. However, as gold prices fell and rice prices stabilized, the atmosphere outside the market also eased. The day before yesterday, there were still no sellers for the Golden Dragon brand at 60 yuan, but yesterday, although they shouted 60 yuan, there was no buyer. The bran, which was originally hoarded by the industry on the pretext of scarce supply, was raised by another one or two yuan per small bag, opening at 57.5 yuan.

### Huge Amount of Gold Bars Arrive: Gold Prices Plunge to 1,800 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot gold market was severely bearish, with prices falling close to the 20,000 yuan mark. People were greatly panicked, and the market price was constantly under selling pressure. It is rumored that huge amounts of gold bars have arrived from Tianjin and Nanjing, and that securities firms and a certain gold shop were the first to sell them off. From the early morning, a certain money shop first offered ten taels at a price of 22,150 yuan, lowering it by 350 yuan. Securities firms then sold to two gold shops, ten taels each, for 22,100 yuan. A certain jewelry store followed the steps of the silver shops and shouted for lower prices to sell. Securities firms (on behalf of Tianjin firms) and cash shops also sold. At noon, the price fell to 21,400 yuan, and at midday, it was 21,500 yuan. In the afternoon, a small money shop first offered ten taels for 21,350 yuan, 150 yuan lower. A certain gold shop (on behalf of Nanjing firms) and securities firms then competed to sell, and cash shops also sold, dropping another 850 yuan. The lowest price was between two gold shops, who exchanged ten taels for 20,500 yuan. A certain jewelry store bought a small amount, and an outside customer came to buy. At 4 o'clock, it rebounded to 20,700 yuan, a drop of 1,800 yuan compared to the previous day's final price. The trading volume was active, with the high and low prices differing by 1,650 yuan. Gold shop brand gold was sold in the market for around 21,000 yuan and bought in for about 20,000 yuan.

Ornamental Gold Marked Down by 130 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores, Datong Heng and Xin Tong Heng, was marked down by 30 yuan in the morning, to 2,220 yuan. In the afternoon, it was marked down twice, a total of 100 yuan, to 2,120 yuan (bought in for around 2,000 yuan), a reduction of 130 yuan. As for fine silver, Datong Heng and Xin Tong Heng did not list the price. When asked, they said it was still 22 yuan per tael. The labor cost of various ornaments has increased by 250 percent, and it is reported that unscrupulous merchants outside the industry are doing underground trading, raising the price to 33-34 yuan per tael.

### British Exchange Rate Sees High Prices Again; Market Begins to Rebound; US Dollars Enter the 40 Yuan Range

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the posted rates of the Central Bank and HSBC. The HSBC counter price was also flat. The black market for British and American exchange rates was tight first, then slightly rebounded. Recently, sugar trading firms have been buying up foreign exchange due to the arrival of goods, pushing the British gold exchange rate to an unprecedented high of one penny and seventy-five, and the US dollar exchange rate to two yuan and sixty-two and a half. Both were sold by a certain industrialist silk merchant. Later, the buying frenzy subsided as there were rumors that the Stabilization Fund would increase the amount of legitimate commercial exchange settlements this month. At noon, it began to harden, and in the afternoon, there were buyers for British gold at two pence and US dollars at three yuan, with prices similar to the closing prices of the previous night.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds falling by 10 yuan along with the spot gold price. The market price of British gold notes rose by 3 yuan due to the need for funding. The price of US dollar notes rose to 41 yuan again in the morning, but soon fell, retreating to 39.8 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 7 jiao compared to the previous day. There was still a demand for Hong Kong dollar notes, and the market price continued to rise by 2 jiao. The price of Japanese yen notes and Korean won notes rose even more sharply, with the former rising to 3 yuan and 9 jiao 3 fen, and the latter rising to 3 yuan and 7 jiao.

### Future Yarn Adds 100 Yuan; Settlement Prices Evened Out; Shuang Ma Factory Orders See High Prices Again

The yarn market continued to rise, and the momentum remained tight. This is because raw materials are rising daily, leading to a generally bullish outlook. The morning opening price for 20-count Shuang Ma Factory orders was 3,110 yuan, but those gathered in the market all wanted to buy, so the situation remained enthusiastic. In one go, it rose to a new record of 3,230 yuan, then slightly reduced profits, continuing to ease to 3,155 yuan. However, after the price fell, the buying sentiment rebounded, rising again to 3,190 yuan. The closing price was 3,185 yuan. The market turnover was relatively improved.

The situation of ready yarn was firm at first, then continued to rise, then returned to normal, but buyers were still numerous and energetic. Therefore, the selling price was going up round by round. Upon investigation, the intention to purchase was related to the rising cost of raw materials at the factory, so the idea of hoarding was still strong. It was found that the market price of ready yarn, both coarse and fine, wanted to rise by 7, 8, and 10 yuan, with about 600 packages being traded. Yihe Factory offered dozens of packages of Rouge Tiger, priced at 2,150 yuan.

The Jin Shuang Ma futures market, in order to take care of the market price soaring, the association resolved to temporarily settle the price, and the near and far months all rose by 100 yuan as the settlement standard. Both the long and short sides were evened out. The settlement price for November was 2,648 yuan, for December it was 2,704 yuan, and for January it was 2,758 yuan.

### On the Pretext of Weak Supply, Ready Cotton's Rising Momentum Remains Strong

The situation of ready cotton: the rising momentum is unstoppable. However, the gold price has rebounded slightly, but people are still unwilling to relax, saying that the arrival of goods is weak, so the prices of coarse and fine cotton continue to rise by ten to twenty yuan. However, the trading is extremely light. The opening prices are listed below:

Durella 100 pieces 700.0, Jia Warehouse delivery
Oomra 100 pieces 758.0 again
Cao Huo Ji 250 bales 580.0 again
Again 500 bales 600.0 again
Lan Gong 100 pieces 720.0 again
Again 100 pieces 725.0 again
Again 100 pieces Open 35.0 again
Again 100 pieces 718.0 again
Again 100 pieces 720.0 again
Again 100 pieces 725.0 again
Again 95 pieces 720.0 again

### Although Sugar Arrives Steadily, Sugar Speculation is Red-Hot; Yesterday the Market Still Announced Rising Limits

Yesterday's sugar market's rising momentum remained strong. The futures group announced rising limits in both the morning and afternoon, showing that speculation is just getting started. The company's futures 24 Coarse White was still flat in the morning market. The opening price for November 10th was 330 yuan, which immediately jumped to 53 yuan.

### Government Bonds are Relatively Firm; Foreign Stocks are Also Active

The after-hours trading of government bonds was relatively firm yesterday. After falling for two consecutive days, it slightly rebounded. Category C broke 5 yuan twice, but ultimately closed at 5 yuan and 6 jiao, indicating that the shorts were a bit crowded, and short covering pushed the price up by several jiao. But the foundation still did not appear strong. The current market price of government bonds is affected by the soaring prices, and it is enough to stabilize it temporarily. Yesterday morning, Tong Kang, Tong Shun, and Shun Tai were all buying, and Run De Sheng and Da Jiu Feng once surged down. Category C once broke 5 yuan, then immediately went up. In the afternoon, Hong Da and Shun Tai bought, and there was also a considerable demand from retail investors. Although Hu He Ji and Yi Tai sold, opening at only 4 yuan and 9 jiao, the demand already exceeded the supply, and it was raised to 5 yuan and 7 jiao. The situation stabilized slightly, and then the course of the long and short sides was considered. As a result, the market price rose uniformly by one jiao and a half to five jiao. The total volume was about 1.6 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

In stock trading, 500 shares of Meng Qiang Tong Zha Bei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 19 yuan and 5 jiao.

Also, the stock market of the Public Industry Association was very active, the scope of transactions expanded, and the number of new buyers increased greatly, with prices rising to a peak. Rubber stocks were stronger than industrial stocks. British Wool Company shares debuted at a high price of 10 yuan and 75, and closed at 20 yuan. The transaction volume was extremely large.

### Eastern Cloth Wildly Surges and Plunges, Exaggerating Speculation

The fine cloth, the leader of the eastern cloth spot market, surged and plunged, changing in an instant, which is rare in history. It rose linearly in the morning, reaching a peak of 136 yuan. Later, due to the profit-taking of the longs, it closed at 129 yuan and 5 jiao. The market opened in the afternoon, and once again stepped up, pulling back to 136 yuan. Suddenly, news came that the gold price had fallen, and sellers rose up, pushing it down to close at 124 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous day.

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, it gradually trended upwards, with a slight consolidation in the middle. As a result, it was still higher than the previous day.

### New Supplementary Rules for Price Control Approved by Consular Body; Gradual Control of Prices of Various Essential Goods; Swire & Co. Investigates Sugar Merchants' Refusal to Sell

Pudong Salt Shipments to Shanghai Restricted, Salt Prices Subject to Profiteering

The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), in order to manage the retail prices of goods within the Settlement, previously requested the Consular Body to approve new supplementary rules to the Land Regulations, so as to proceed with drafting current regulations regarding price control. It is now learned that the aforementioned supplementary rules have been formally approved by the Consular Body, and the SMC has issued a public notice announcing the contents of the new articles. The notice is reproduced below:

Approved New Supplementary Articles

"It is approved that the Senior Consul's letter informs that the proposed 'Supplementary Article 53 to the Land Regulations,' in accordance with Article 11 of the said Regulations, is hereby approved. The text of the new supplementary article is as follows: 'Any individual, partnership, or company that manufactures any goods shall comply with the rules published by the SMC from time to time regarding the quantity and storage location of such goods, the records that should be kept, or the prices at which they are sold. Any individual, partnership, or company that violates any provision contained in the rules promulgated by the SMC in accordance with this supplementary article shall be subject to (A) the penalties stipulated in Article 17 of the Land Regulations, or other penalties deemed fair by the competent court, or (B) the SMC may detain or revoke the license held by such individual, partnership, or company, or impose the aforementioned penalties concurrently with the detention or revocation of the license.'"

Consular Body Expresses Support for Suppressing Prices

The penalty rules stipulated in the new supplementary rules include those based on Article 17 of the Land Regulations. The text of that article states: "Hereafter, if anyone violates these Regulations, and a report is made to the Consul or the Consul is notified by a local official, the Consul may, within his jurisdiction, directly summon the violator to appear. If the facts are verified, he may impose a penalty, or commute the penalty to a fine of no more than three hundred dollars, or imprisonment for a term of no more than six months, or use other fair means. If the foreign violator has no Consul in Shanghai, the SMC may request the Consuls of one or more countries to file a lawsuit with the main Chinese authorities to maintain the integrity of these Regulations and punish the violators." Furthermore, Article 11 of the Land Regulations, upon which the Consular Body based its approval of the new supplementary rules, stipulates that the SMC authorities "have the right to issue additional rules at any time, and may cancel, alter, or amend the rules." It is generally believed that the Consular Body's approval of these new supplementary rules is not only in accordance with the regulations, but also because the Consular Body has previously expressed the need to suppress rising prices within the Settlement.

Detailed Management Rules to Be Announced at Any Time

According to an SMC official, the SMC will immediately take effective measures to exercise the power to manage prices granted by the new supplementary rules, because the SMC has already completed administrative and legal preparations in advance. As for which "items that should be subject to price control as announced by the SMC from time to time," the official said that this will include foreign rice, which has already begun, and essential commodities such as flour, which will begin soon. "The detailed rules will be announced by the SMC at any time." Other items "sold by food companies and pharmacies, such as imported or locally manufactured food, seasonings, cleaning supplies, medicines, cigarettes, tobacco, soap, and beverages, etc.," will also comply with these supplementary rules. The retail prices will be assessed in consultation with importers and manufacturers to provide a reasonable profit margin. The prices, once approved by the SMC, will be set as maximum prices and must not be exceeded. Violators will be punished in accordance with the new supplementary rules. Well-informed sources believe that the maximum prices for the above items will be assessed in the near future.

Bureau's Regulations to Be Discussed Daily

It is expected that the SMC will announce retail prices at any time hereafter, strictly ordering retailers to comply. The SMC has begun holding meetings every morning in the meeting room to discuss price control measures. SMC officials, such as Secretary Fessenden and Secretary Peissel, will review and handle price-related matters that arise daily. Yesterday, the SMC stated that a newspaper had reported a few days ago that 1 million bags of rice and 2 million bags of flour would be shipped to Tianjin by the Zao Sheng vessel. Because this statement was not factual and if not corrected, it would be mistaken as a reduction in the city's food reserves and stimulate price increases. The Bureau of Publications was instructed to send a letter to various newspapers for correction, and to publish the accurate number of bags shipped to Tianjin that day by the Fu Sheng vessel: 30,490 bags of flour, 5,200 bags of sugar, and 800 bags of rice.

Ample Sugar Stocks, Salt Shipments Obstructed

Recently, the SMC has been making every effort to control prices. In addition to daily necessities such as briquettes and flour, for which decisions have already been made, it is rumored that sugar will also be subject to control. According to inquiries, the current sugar stocks in various warehouses in the city are sufficient for one and a half years. Moreover, sugar sources are very smooth, with large quantities being shipped from the Dutch East Indies and other places. It is expected that once the SMC has devised control measures, sugar prices can be expected to fall sharply.

Sugar Merchants Refuse to Sell

Citizens in this city are currently suffering from being unable to purchase sugar. Those who can purchase it find that the selling price is astronomically high, breaking records and continuing to rise. This reporter contacted six major wholesale stores this morning (the 4th), five of which claimed that the sugar was sold out. The remaining one also said that it had sold the last bag, with a 10-pound bag reaching a huge 28 yuan. However, a responsible person from Swire & Co., which distributes Taikoo Sugar, stated that sugar imports to Shanghai have been quite normal recently, and that Swire & Co.'s supply of sugar to retailers has not decreased. In addition, there are tens of thousands of bags of granulated sugar stockpiled in the city. Retailers have no excuse not to sell sugar.

Reports Welcome

The public should report to Swire & Co. if they are unable to purchase sugar from a particular store, so that the company can investigate whether these stores purchase sugar from Swire & Co. If they do purchase from Swire, the company will take constructive steps to deal with it. The official continued that a Swire ship was slightly damaged en route to Shanghai, which may be the reason for the rumors of a sugar shortage. Some stores do not purchase sugar directly from Swire & Co., but purchase it from intermediaries, and their sugar stocks may have decreased. However, in general, Shanghai's sugar supply is quite sufficient. A sugar shortage and halting the sale of sugar is not a valid excuse. However, the recent surge in prices of various commodities has been like a frenzy. The price of vermicelli at a certain food store doubled between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM yesterday morning.

Salt Prices Increase Again

Salt prices in the city have been soaring recently. Although it is not due to hoarding, retailers must be taking the opportunity to profiteer. In recent years, most of the salt used by Chinese residents in the two Settlements has been purchased from rural women in Pudong. It is rumored that these rural women have been unable to smuggle salt into the Settlements for sale recently due to restrictions imposed by Pudong authorities. A few days ago, citizens could still purchase 1.4 liang of salt per yuan from these salt vendors, but this is now rarely available. Retailers have taken the opportunity to raise salt prices, causing citizens to encounter a new difficulty in purchasing daily necessities at reasonable prices.

### 100,000 Tons of Coal Dust to Be Shipped Soon

According to shipping industry news, major coal companies in the city have concluded transactions for approximately 150,000 tons of coal since the beginning of last month. Approximately 100,000 tons have already been loaded onto ships in the production area and are expected to be shipped within days. If there are no unforeseen circumstances, they are expected to arrive in port successively in mid-November. It is understood that most of the coal is coal dust needed for the manufacture of briquettes. However, this type of coal dust has all been ordered by major coal companies in the city. According to news from the coal industry, the coal dust needed for the manufacture of briquettes is still amply stored in the city, and there is no concern about future shortages. At the same time, because this coal dust was purchased in batches six months ago, its purchase price was very low. Therefore, the manufacturing costs of briquettes at major mechanized briquette factories in the city have not increased.

Coal Stock Numbers Have Not Yet Been Announced

The coal stored in various large and small warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, western Shanghai, and the French Concession remains abundant as always. However, the Shanghai Coal Industry Association has sent letters to all member companies, requesting them to list and report all anthracite coal stocks to the association, so that it can know the exact amount of coal stocks. The association has set a deadline of the end of October for the completion of this survey. However, as of yesterday, the association has not yet announced the results of the survey to the public. However, according to those familiar with the coal market, the coal stored in various warehouses in the city is sufficient to meet the city's winter needs.

### Countries Inspect Shanghai Mail

According to news from the Shanghai Postal Administration, after the international situation became tense, all countries have implemented inspections of incoming and outgoing mail. In addition to the Far East, Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, and Burma, where inspections have been in place for a long time, mail sent to Shanghai from the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, and other places has recently been opened and inspected by local post offices. Japanese postal inspections are the most stringent. Letters and parcels sent by foreigners have not been spared. As for whether any mail has been detained, no reports have been received to date.

### After the Detention of the Southern Vessel, Protests to Customs

The captain of the Yugoslav cargo ship "Tomislav," Mr. Baumgartner, stated that he had submitted a protest to the Jianghai Customs authorities yesterday morning regarding the detention of the "Tomislav." The vessel is under Yugoslavian sovereignty, and a telegram from the shipowner confirms that the vessel has not been transferred to any party. Although the Italian sailors on board have been withdrawn, three senior officers and thirty sailors from the "Contovant" vessel remain.

### Nanyang Business Investigation Group to Depart at the End of the Month; Executive Yuan Allocates 50,000 Yuan

Preparations for the Nanyang Business Investigation Group, organized by Shanghai and Hong Kong business circles, have been completed, and the Executive Yuan has approved a subsidy of 50,000 yuan from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The group has now appointed Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Shuchun, Dong Zhongwei, and Ye Lanquan as nominating committee members to review the qualifications of group members and the selection of members. It is hoped to include experts in textiles, enterprises, trade, and economics, as well as those with close ties to trade with India. The departure date is set for the end of this month, with a gathering in Hong Kong to depart.

### Forgetting Righteousness for Profit, Attempting to Hoard Winter Clothing

Since commodity prices in the city have been constantly rising, people are engaging in the accumulation of goods (especially daily necessities), causing prices to soar. Recently, some people, seeing that winter clothing prices are rising daily due to the cold weather, are attempting to purchase in large quantities the winter clothing distributed by various charitable organizations to impoverished citizens (such as the winter clothing made by the Sanjiao Daode Charity Council, weighing 3.3 jin and selling for 13 yuan, which would cost 17-18 yuan at current market prices). They plan to purchase them in thousands, but this has been discovered and rejected by the council. To prevent abuses, the council has specially stamped the name of the Sanjiao Council and the words "Charity Clothing" inside and outside the clothing. At the same time, it has notified all charitable organizations in the city not to be exploited and have the clothing purchased in large quantities, so as to avoid problems with the winter clothing for the poor.

### Angelica and Rhubarb Approved for Shipment to Restricted Areas; Limited to Exchange for Daily Necessities for Internal Transport; Supply of Essential Chinese Medicines Guaranteed

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce office in Hong Kong, stating that the ministry, after consideration, believes that the production of angelica and rhubarb is very abundant in the northwest provinces. If a long-term ban on transportation is in place, domestic sales will be limited, which will inevitably lead to overproduction and affect the rural economy. Moreover, angelica and rhubarb are essential Chinese medicines. In order to combine clearance with the transportation ban, it is tentatively decided to allow normal domestic merchants to purchase and transport angelica and rhubarb to restricted areas for sale, and exchange them for daily necessities to be transported to the rear. However, they must first apply to the local chamber of commerce for a letter of guarantee, and submit it for approval to issue a transportation permit. After the exchanged goods are transported back, they must still report to the local competent authority for inspection and submit the permit for cancellation, in order to implement control. This is hereby telegraphed for notification.

### Reducing the Size of Measuring Instruments, Concealing Them on Private Premises; Rice Stores Exploiting the Common People; Police Arrest Criminals and Send Them to Court for Strict Handling; Knowingly Violating the Law, Deep Concern from All Sectors

Half-price foreign rice from the SMC continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo vessel "Taiyuan" and "Chongqing" arrived successively yesterday, each carrying 10,200 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, totaling 20,400 bags, and docked at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading.

Reducing the Size of Measuring Instruments, Exploiting the Common People

The North-China Daily News reported that Qiu, a member of the Executive Committee of the Rice Merchants Association of the French Concession, who has a rice store at 181 Rue Muling (now Maoming Road), privately used reduced-size measuring instruments to exploit the common people. The authorities discovered this and filed a lawsuit according to law. The First Special District Court held a hearing on the case last Saturday, but Qiu did not appear in court. The First Special District Court has now issued another summons, scheduling a hearing for this Saturday. According to the police of the International Settlement, they went to Qiu's rice store on October 20 and discovered the reduced-size measuring instruments, which were immediately confiscated. They also questioned the shop assistants. It is said that Qiu then reported to the police headquarters, claiming that two Chinese detectives were attempting to extort money. However, after an investigation by detectives from the police department, it was found that the two detectives were innocent and there was no extortion. The Rice Merchants Association of the French Concession is a consulting group for the French Municipal Council on the matter of lowering rice prices. It is noteworthy that Qiu, as an executive member of the association, is using altered measuring instruments in his rice store.

Selling Fair-Priced Rice, Daring to Conceal It

The Renchang Rice Store at 22 Tongfu Road, opened by Wang Yingneng, was scheduled to sell fair-priced rice from the SMC yesterday. Common people lined up in the streets in the early morning, waiting in line. Sun Jianguo and Zhang Dehong waited from 7:00 AM until 11:00 AM, but the rice store claimed that the rice was sold out and closed the iron gates, stopping the sale. However, Sun and others saw three bags of white rice hidden in the store, which was a deliberate refusal to sell. When they negotiated, a shop assistant named Huang Hengde from Pudong claimed that this was first-class white rice, and the selling price was 180 yuan per bag, which caused a dispute. At that time, Deputy Head Detective Bai Fumin of the Chengdu Road Police Station happened to be patrolling and asked about the situation. Huang still claimed that the fair-priced rice was sold out. After inspection, it was found that the so-called three bags of first-class white rice were all fair-priced rice from the SMC. Huang, along with the three bags of rice, was taken to the police station. Detective Du Yunqi was assigned to investigate. Huang admitted that the rice was reserved by six employees of the store. Later, the accountant of the store, Zhu Xinghe from Jiading, was arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit according to Articles 12 and 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during the Emergency Period. The defendants hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Tao Wutu to defend them. The court ordered the two defendants Huang and Zhu to be remanded in custody, and the hearing was postponed to summon the shop owner and other shop assistants for further verification.

### Armistice Day of the First European War

Next Tuesday is the anniversary of the cessation of the First World War, also known as European War Peace Memorial Day. British, French, American, and Soviet citizens in this city who love peace will hold a memorial service at that time. On the morning of that day, the British Victory Council will lead the expatriates in laying flowers in front of the statue of the Goddess of Peace. French priests will also hold Mass at the Catholic Church on Rue des Soeurs (now Tianzhutang Street) and the Labor Shenfu Road Catholic Church separately to pray for peace. The Royal Society of England will also hold a luncheon on that day at the HSBC Building Clubhouse, during which a fundraising event will be held to comfort the Red Army fighting bloody battles under the leadership of the Soviet government. The U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai will hold a prayer in front of the Goddess of Peace led by the chaplain, and Colonel Howard will lay a wreath to express condolences. With the Soviet-German war in full swing, the people of Shanghai, while commemorating the peace of the European War, hope to see the flames of aggression extinguished as soon as possible, so that the world can be established on peace as soon as possible. As for the anniversary of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, Soviet expatriates in Shanghai have scheduled a celebration this Friday and will raise funds for the military, so as not to betray the good intentions of this commemorative event.

### North-China Daily News Resumes Operation; Normal Operations Resume Today

All Chinese employees of the British-owned North-China Daily News went on strike on the morning of the 3rd of this month due to the failure to obtain a salary increase from the newspaper. Afterwards, the chairman of the newspaper, Mr. Arnhold, together with Taipan Davis and compradore Yang Wenqing, and the chairman of the newspaper's labor union, Yao Liren, summoned employee representatives Zhang Shaoliang for open and honest negotiations. A satisfactory solution was reached that evening, and work was resumed. However, because the resumption of work was late that evening, the newspaper only published eight pages, totaling two large sheets, yesterday. Normal operations will resume as usual today. The content of the salary increase method is as follows: (1) Those with original wages below 50 yuan will receive an increase of 100%; those with wages between 51 yuan and 70 yuan will receive an increase of 70%; those with wages between 71 yuan and 90 yuan will receive an increase of 55%; those with wages above 90 yuan will receive an increase of 40%;

Now that the Chinese army has recovered the city, order has gradually been restored, and telegram registration has been resumed. According to a representative of the Great Eastern and Great Northern Telegraph Company yesterday, the company has received notification from the Fuzhou Telegraph Bureau that, starting today, telegrams sent to that location can be sent by using telegram registration as usual, without having to specify the full name and address of the recipient. Therefore, telegrams sent to Fuzhou in the future will be more convenient than before, which can save on telegraph fees.

### Hellmich Returns to Shanghai

Judge Hellmich of the United States Court for China is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of next week, or even within this week.

Unless he disembarked in Honolulu on the way, his arrival in Shanghai is imminent. According to reliable sources, the President Van Buren vessel is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next Monday.

### Loading and Unloading at Taikoo Wharf Suspended Briefly Yesterday Morning; Workers Demand Wage Increase; Contractors Agreed, Work Resumed Immediately

The loading and unloading of cargo on various ships of the British-owned Taikoo Navigation Company, as well as the handling workers in the cabins and bottoms of the ships, are contracted by Changshun and Lianxin godowns. The number of workers is five to six hundred.

The wages were increased to 4 yuan per worker this spring, with the same wage for all-night work and a night snack of 5 jiao. Recently, the prices of various commodities in the city have repeatedly soared, so the livelihood of the common people has been unsustainable. Affected by the soaring prices, the workers recently proposed to the Changshun and Lianxin godown contractors to increase wages. The godowns contract with Taikoo, so the price increase for workers must also be requested from Taikoo. Because a senior British official of the company is ill in the hospital, it could not be resolved immediately, and it was scheduled to be discussed on the 10th. However, the workers did not agree to the delay and went on strike yesterday morning, causing the work at the Taikoo wharves on the Bund in the French Concession to be suspended. The Qiongzhou, Jinan, Taiyuan, and Chongqing vessels were docked at the wharves and were waiting to load and unload cargo. The company then ordered the two godown contractors,

The contractors in a hurry

Agreed to increase the workers' wages by 2 yuan to 6 yuan, with the same wage for night work, and the night snack was increased from 5 jiao to 1 yuan. The workers then expressed their satisfaction and resumed work in the afternoon. It is said that the contractors and the company will discuss the matter after the senior official of the company recovers from his illness, and there will be a good outcome.

### Raw Materials Are Difficult to Obtain, Sales Are Not Smooth; Various Industries Are Declining; Only Rubber Factories and Paper Mills Are Doing Well

The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council issued its October report, stating that the output of various cotton mills last month was almost the same as in recent months. At the beginning of the month, due to the strong purchasing power of the Hong Kong gangs, the yarn market saw an increase. However, after the Jianghai Customs announced a ban on the transportation of cotton cloth on October 9, the selling price fell back. Finally, due to various speculative reasons, the yarn price rose again.

Yarn Prices Increased by 70% in Three Months

It is estimated that since the implementation of the freezing order on July 26, yarn prices have risen by 75%. Unless the cotton products can be restored, the future of the yarn mill industry is not promising. Although various cotton mills have cotton stocks that can continue to be used, they will stop working unless the situation changes.

Candle and Soap Sales Have Clearly Weakened

The dyeing and bleaching industry is usually busier in the fall, but the work is more relaxed this autumn. Several rubber factories have obtained rubber raw materials from Siam. The season for manufacturing galoshes has now begun. A few rubber shoe factories that had been closed for several months have now reopened. The candle and soap industry originally had a market in the occupied areas, but now it feels that the purchasing power of the people in those areas has weakened, affecting sales. Moreover, raw materials are not easy to find, and even the fish oil from Japan has recently been restricted. The operating scope of sawmills is only half of their capacity.

Light Bulbs and Toys Are Lacking Raw Materials

Many light bulb factories have stopped working due to a lack of raw materials. Toy factories have few orders. Factories that manufacture tin toys have difficulty working due to a shortage of raw materials. Only larger factories that manufacture seasonings are operating. Paper mills are busy, and local sales are good and prices are high. The products of felt hat factories can still be exported, but the future supply of wool raw materials is currently uncertain.

Hardware Factories' Output Is Sluggish

Factories that use hardware materials encounter difficulties in finding raw materials. The copper scrap used in copper rolling shops is almost impossible to obtain. Electric motors and transformers cannot be exported at present. Electric fans are manufactured as usual and can now be shipped abroad. Enamel factories are only operating at one-tenth of their usual capacity. Only five cigarette factories in the western Shanghai area are operating.

### Lodger in the Cangzhou Hotel Commits Suicide by Poison

The Cangzhou Hotel at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road in the Public Concession suddenly received a lodger at 4:00 PM on the 3rd of this month. He was wearing a beautiful suit, with a dark gray overcoat, and appeared to be in his twenties. The waiter led him to room 112, where he signed his English name T.K. Chang. He carried a gold watch and a gold bracelet. He paid 100 yuan in national currency. After the waiter brought tea and water, he immediately closed the door. In the evening, he ordered Western food from the waiter, and after eating, there was no movement all night. The next day at noon, the hotel routinely asked the lodger if he wanted to extend his stay. The waiter called for a long time but received no response, which aroused suspicion. They then tried to open the door and saw that the young man was lying on the bed, his eyes fixed and his mouth agape, barely breathing. An empty bottle of poisonous potion was found on the table, confirming that he had committed suicide by poison. The room service then reported to the front desk, which reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. He was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital in an ambulance, but it was too late, and he died shortly after. The body was then transferred to the coroner's office for examination. The police station is investigating his family and waiting to claim the body for funeral arrangements.

### Golden City Grand Theater Thrown a Smoke Bomb

At the Golden City Grand Theater, located at 780 Beijing Road, around 9:12 PM last night, during the peak of ticket sales, someone unexpectedly threw a smoke bomb. It exploded instantly, and thick smoke billowed out uncontrollably. The theater reported the incident to the Lao Zha station of the police department, who dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate and track down the person who threw the bomb for further action.

### No-Guest Brawl Inside the Great China Ballroom

Yesterday, around 1 AM, inside the New Great China Ballroom on Edward Road, two Indian dancers suddenly, for unknown reasons, clashed with guests at a nearby table. A fierce fight broke out, and beer bottles and chairs went flying. The other dancers in the ballroom, unaware of the truth, fled in terror, causing chaos. After detectives arrived to quell the disturbance, it was discovered that two Indians, a national of some country, and one staff member of the ballroom, a total of four people, were injured, but all injuries were minor. However, upon inspection, the ballroom had suffered considerable damage.

At the Xinhua Restaurant, located at 345 Guangxi Road, at 8 PM the night before last, paint merchant Wang Renji held a banquet for colleagues. Around 10 PM, as the gathering was dispersing, Ni Fusheng, a Ningbo native and owner of Nishengji Paint Shop at 4, Lane 954, Chengdu Road, who contracted painting work for the Public Works Department, had a conflict with Xu Guishan (64 years old), a Pudong native and owner of Shunxing Paint Shop at 163, Lane 1492, Xinzha Road, due to jesting. At the time, Ni unexpectedly used a vegetable basin to violently strike Xu's head, causing his head to be fractured. Xu, being tall and old, roared loudly after being injured, and soon collapsed to the ground. The restaurant urgently called an ambulance to transport him to the hospital for treatment, but he was pronounced dead. Upon receiving the report, the Lao Zha police department immediately ordered Chinese Detective Tao Genrong and Detective Zhang Decai to rush to the scene to investigate. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination, while Ni was arrested. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. After questioning by Judge Ru Baoyi, the police department's lawyer, Ni was ordered to be detained pending a further hearing.

### Recent Developments at National Central University Graduate School: Thirty-Three Earn Master's Degrees, Distributed Across Various National Institutions

(Qujiang Dispatch) Since its establishment in the spring of 1935, the Graduate School of National Central University has existed for seven years. Thirty-three graduate students have earned master's degrees and are distributed across various universities and government institutions.

The teacher training institute has two departments: education and educational psychology. The agricultural institute has two departments: soil science and agricultural and forestry plants.

This year, the Ministry of Education has increased the school's funding for equipment and research by 120,000 national currency, demonstrating the Ministry of Education's high regard for the school's role in cultivating talent to replace foreign graduate schools.

### Qian Xucang Creates New Type of Ball Sport: Round-Goal Ball Successfully Tested

Combines the Advantages of Basketball and Soccer

Grand Demonstration Match to be Held Soon

Qian Xucang, the coach of the Shanghai Blue and White basketball teams, is an enthusiastic promoter of sports. Last year, he promoted Center Ball (Goal·Hi) and other sports with great enthusiasm. Recently, Mr. Qian has drawn on his experience of over ten years of dedication to sports to create a new type of ball sport, named Round-Goal Ball. It combines the advantages of basketball and soccer, and after much consideration and design, it has been successfully developed. He has built a court at Guoqiang Middle School on Aiwenyi Road and has begun experimental play. The rules have been compiled and printed, and those interested can write to the sports department of Guoqiang Middle School to obtain them. Mr. Qian plans to hold a grand demonstration match in the near future to draw attention from people in the sports world. It is expected that this exciting and intense Round-Goal Ball will become popular and add a new color to China's sports scene. The outline of the competition is as follows:

Brief Description of the Game

The Round-Goal Ball court is rectangular, slightly larger than a basketball court. It can be played indoors or outdoors. At each end of the court, there is a round goal. The court is marked with white lines to indicate the sidelines, end lines, center line, serving line, and goal area line. Each team consists of six players (the size of the large court and the number of players are the same as in soccer), one of whom serves as the goalkeeper. The other players can use their hands and limbs above the knees to pass, dribble, and throw the ball in any way (except that the goalkeeper can use their feet within the goal area) with the goal of getting the ball into the opponent's round goal. At the same time, players must closely defend against the opponent's players from getting the ball into their own team's round goal.

Meaning of the Round Goal

The goal is a regular rounded shape, 210 cm high and 360 cm wide, the same size as a small soccer goal. Because it is easier for players to aim when throwing the ball at the goal with their hands, the two corners of the goal are cut into semi-circular arcs of equal radius to reduce the difficulty of the goalkeeper's defense and to avoid irretrievable dangerous balls, thereby increasing the interest in the game.

Rules of the Game

The rules of Round-Goal Ball are compiled with reference to basketball and soccer. Actions such as dribbling, tapping the ball, throwing the ball, passing the ball, and jumping ball are similar to basketball. The regulations for violations and fouls are also based on basketball precedents. The penalties are divided into throwing in-line balls, corner kicks, goal kicks, and free kicks, six-meter balls, etc., which are similar to soccer. As for the rules for the goalkeeper and the goal area, they are slightly different from soccer. Among them, the restrictions on players entering the goal area are particularly strict. The goal area is semi-circular. Apart from the goalkeeper, any player who enters or touches the goal area line will be considered a foul and punished accordingly. The rules regarding game officials, game time, start of the game, temporary pauses, game terminology, wins and losses, violations, fouls, free kicks, corner kicks, six-meter balls, etc. have all been specially defined in the rules and are detailed without omission.

Advantages

The movement of round gate ball is a combination of the rules of basketball and soccer, and the movement of the game is actually faster than soccer and simpler than basketball. There is no dull or bitter stage in the whole game, and it is always compact and full of interest. This is one advantage. Although there are many changes in offensive and defensive techniques, they are extremely easy to learn, unlike basketball or soccer where shooting or scoring cannot be done without a long period of practice. There is a big difference, so it is very easy to popularize. This is the second. The speed of movement is moderate, without the drawbacks of being too strenuous or too slow. It has an average development for all parts of the body, and it is suitable for the physical fitness of our country's people. This is the third. From the above observations, Round-Goal Ball is indeed the most ideal new type of ball sport in our country at present. Sports enthusiasts and sports experts will definitely be happy to promote it in order to popularize it. A recent photo of Mr. Qian Xucang, the creator of Round-Goal Ball.

Spring and Autumn

### Serving Peanuts to Foreign Guests

— Ping Ye

Yesterday's newspaper reported that Chongqing News: "Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie is scheduled to host foreign guests and Chinese and foreign journalists on the 5th, serving wonton noodles, dumplings, yellow wine, white wine, dried tofu, and peanuts. This is to use local materials, without spending foreign exchange."

We in Shanghai are accustomed to seeing those with idle capital eating and dressing only in foreign goods, spending foreign exchange at every turn. Some people even speculate and hoard goods when foreign exchange is tight, others buy foreign exchange and hoard foreign currency, and still others explore the black market, even rushing to the so-called "black black market," caring only about personal gain and not caring about pushing the majority of ordinary people into deep water. As fellow citizens, how can we not feel indignant?

We imagine that when dried tofu and peanuts are presented together at Wang's reception, the foreign guests present will pay their respects to the suffering Chinese nation. They will certainly not be as decadent, arrogant, extravagant, and dissolute as those in Shanghai teahouses, dance halls, restaurants, and banquet halls, where they are committing slow suicide.

Born in sorrow, dying in peace. Everyone who reads this news report, I think, should feel something. Moreover, at this time when the autumn wind is strong and severe winter is approaching, when we think of how many people are struggling for survival for the public in the ice and snow, and how many people are displaced from their homes, waiting for the arrival of light, enduring suffering and hardship, while the people in Shanghai are enjoying themselves at will, "behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine rot, while on the road, there are frozen corpses." Anyone with a little conscience will surely feel guilty. The winter clothing drive, the student aid movement, the women's relief movement—if people can turn their thoughts to these activities while eating shark fin and chewing on big dishes, they will surely lose their appetite and voluntarily transfer these unnecessary expenses to relief efforts.

### Familiar Queue

— Fang Qiang

It seems like a long time since I've seen it—the long snake formation that starts at the entrance of the rice store. However, the situation in the past two days is even more "lively" than it was more than half a year ago—stretching from one end of the road to the other. The two or three hundred shops in between are of no consequence. Moreover, some queues even turn onto another side street and continue from there. Some even have these "long snake formations" lined up on both sides of the road.

As a result, the shops in this area seem to be under temporary "martial law" at their entrances. To get out, one has to take a big detour. Among them, the few shops next door to the rice store are the most "unlucky."

The police are busy, their batons constantly rising and falling in the air!

The clamor of voices spreads from here, far and wide. It is chaotic and noisy. Each person has a white number marked on them.

The moment when one is about to reach the rice store counter is the most tense, with each shift coming down. The faces of the "snakes" are all flushed.

The clerks inside the counter are sweating, and the sweat is dripping into the rice pile, but it is mixed into the rice grains and sold to the "generals" of the "long snake formation."

People who come to squeeze after a full meal are energetic. But by the time they buy the rice, their stomachs are hurting badly. But it doesn't matter. If they are hungry, they can take the squeezed rice to cook. But after eating, they have to come and squeeze again the next day. In this way, people's lives and time are all taken away by the rice.

However, there are also those who wait for two days and don't get a single grain of rice, so they have to drink plain boiled water!

On the road, there is much discussion, saying, "Buying rice from the Public Works Department at $117 per picul is even more enthusiastic than buying 'low-priced rice' before! Moreover, these rice buyers are clearly of a 'higher' class than the previous queue, and their clothing is much neater than before!"

Indeed, this is the real situation. But it is not surprising that the people who used to squeeze to buy low-priced rice have long gone to eat "pearl rice noodles" or "sweet potatoes"! This time, a new batch of "generals" has been replaced in the "long snake formation." That is a manifestation of "further progress," and we feel "fortunate"! It has even become "better and better"!

Who says this is "going from bad to worse"?

Fortunately, it is "right for our group of people to participate in the 'long snake formation'!" Just have the "bosses" who ride in cars hoard a little more, and put a little more in the warehouses, and that will be fine!

However, what I find strange here is, will such a miserable situation be allowed to continue to develop? … I dare not think any further!

### A Record of a Certain Student Not Being Employed

— Huo Fubao

Ten Thousand in Savings, Ten Thousand in Capital, You Hurry Up and Dig for Gold for Me

In the morning, I found an advertisement in the newspaper:

"A certain bank wants to recruit a certain student, who must have a junior high school education, a clean background, and a strong physique to be qualified. If interested, please come to No. ×××, ×× Road, for an interview from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on ×th to ×th of this month."

When I read it, my heart felt like it was about to jump out of my mouth. I quickly put on a blue cloth patched coat with white spots and headed towards ×× Road.

As a result, I arrived at my destination, on the third floor of No. ××, ×× Lane.

Walking to the entrance of the third floor, I saw the bank. The room was filled with a dark mass of people. Red silk banners hung all over the place, and silver cups and shields were displayed on the table, a dazzling array. Two writing desks and three sofas were arranged here. On the left, a black board more than ten feet long hung among the red silk banners, painted with the words "Wood Yarn" and "Red Hot" in white paint. Several telephones were installed on the table. An employee held a receiver, listening and reporting the market price to another employee writing on the blackboard.

When I entered, it was already past ten o'clock. There were already so many applicants. After writing my resume, I also joined this group. After half an hour, I managed to squeeze to the front and hurriedly grabbed a chair that had been sat on by several hundred applicants. As soon as I sat down, I immediately felt a kind of electric current running straight through my heartstrings. The face of the "examining committee" gentleman was cold and stern, and his eyes shone like searchlights.

After a few simple questions, he looked at my resume:

"Did you work at ×× Company before?"

"Yes! I was an employee at ×× Company."

"Then how much salary did you get per month?" "Including rice and housing subsidies, it was ×× yuan per month." I answered very cautiously.

"Then why did you resign?" I didn't expect him to ask me this.

"Because... the salary... wasn't enough." When I said it, it was very stiff, and I felt very red in the face. My heart was pounding. But the "examining committee" gentleman seemed to understand and said very crisply: "There are two ways to guarantee you in our bank: first, the shop that guarantees you must deposit 10,000 yuan in my bank and open an account as a deposit; second, our bank needs more capital, so please have the shop that guarantees you invest 10,000 yuan in shares."

I felt disappointed. My hot heart had been frozen. Where could a poor boy find a shop willing to pay 10,000 yuan as a guarantee fee? In the end, he gave me a word of encouragement.

"Your exam was very satisfactory, and you have a chance of being admitted. I hope you work hard to find a guarantor."

I stood up, nodded to the examining committee gentleman, and squeezed out of the crowd without looking back.

Urgent Phenomenon of Reorganization - Yangzijiang, Lecao Central Cooperation

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Xiao Jiqing had to be humble and polite to him. The two sides then decided to have Begonia come to the theater from the next day. Before leaving, Qian Ruomo repeatedly instructed from the side, hoping that Xiao Jiqing would convey to the stage managers to give Begonia extra preferential treatment.

"Mr. Wu, I don't think this matter is very appropriate!" Walking out of the Red Stage Theater, Qian Ruomo stopped on the sidewalk, looking very embarrassed, and said, "Given your former reputation, it doesn't seem very good to be working in the martial arts field, no matter how difficult it is now."

"That doesn't matter. Little Danfeng even played a supporting role in her old age!" Begonia lowered his head and gave a bitter smile. "Anyway, it's the same as using strength to exchange for money, it's not a disgrace."

"Originally, I could have thought of a way for you in the box office," Qian Ruomo said as he walked, relighting the half-smoked cigar in his mouth that had been extinguished for a long time. "Unfortunately, after the war, the market here is getting worse every day, and the curfew is early at night. Now, almost all the box offices are closed. And this war is very strange. There are certainly those who fled into the concession from various places, but there are also many who fled out of the concession. Those rich masters are very confused, and even if they usually like to sing a few lines, they can't muster any interest at the moment." (254)

### A Tense Pantomime

— Maple

Scene: Black Market

People: A portion of Shanghai residents

As the curtain opens, the clock strikes loudly. There is a commotion in the market. The "××× yuan" written on the blackboard suddenly causes a flurry of phone calls. The blackboard is then written with "××××× yuan." The phone rings again. The blackboard is written with "××××× yuan." Everyone in the market is stunned! In an instant, each takes out a bottle of "Lysol" from their arms, looks at each other, laughs, and drinks the "Lysol" in one gulp. Everyone lies down in the market.

Outside the market, there are sounds of "woo... woo..." All ambulances are dispatched. (Moving rewards to help raise funds)

The Sensual and Tragic Story of Yu Tangchun

The play "Yu Tangchun" is based on a true story from the Ming Dynasty. In Hongdong County, Shanxi (this character is pronounced with a rising tone, similar to "tong"), there is a file of the case of Shen, née Pi, plotting to kill her husband, which has been preserved from the Ming Dynasty to the present. Yu Tangchun herself was falsely accused by Pi and forced to confess under torture. Imperial Inspector Wang Jinglong married her after acquitting her and was impeached and dismissed from office, returning to his hometown. This is similar to the plot of Leo Tolstoy's novel "Resurrection." Wang Jinglong was willing to give up his position as Imperial Inspector to marry the woman he loved, which is the same as the sacrificial spirit of the Duke of Windsor. This kind of thing is very interesting in the aspirations of human beings around the world. The play "Yu Tangchun" contains tragedy within its sensuality, so it has always been popular with the public.

In previous years, famous actresses who came to Shanghai would often perform this play on the first day because this play requires a lot of singing, has many good tunes, and can fully demonstrate the actress's skill, not only ensuring a large audience but also taking advantage of the auspiciousness of the actress wearing red clothes on stage, meaning that the actress is popular. Now that Cheng Yanqiu is coming, I heard that she will perform "Yu Tangchun" on the first day. I asked someone to buy tickets for me in advance, but unexpectedly, it was not my turn until ten days later. The ticket was booked early, so I went to see it at the scheduled time. Yang Baosen's "Zhu Lian Village" was already in the final scene of the duel between him and Zhou Dewei, so there is no need to comment on it. Yanqiu used to be known for her mastery of "Yu Tangchun." Her strength lies in her careful attention to the words and her deep, resonant voice, which is enough to express her sorrowful feelings. Now, because she has gained weight, her pitch is slightly lower than before, but her singing is still more fluent than anyone else. I also heard that her tunes are somewhat different from before. The rising tone characters have more low sounds (such as the characters "ren," "qing," and "men"), similar to the way old students of the Tan school sing entirely in the Hubei dialect. This kind of singing is Yanqiu's own creation. I feel that there is still a need to study this matter further, but due to space limitations, I will not discuss it in detail for now. Yanqiu's appearance is more charming than in the past, with a special kind of grace, and she is not less beautiful because of her weight. However, her waist seems to lack elegance, as if she had transformed her body. I don't know when she will be able to relax. I once saw a record in the Song Dynasty that said that a person was fond of Taoist arts and practiced diligently for many years and had formed a sacred embryo but had not understood the method of transformation. The immortal Liu Haichan sent a message asking how he would give birth after ten months of pregnancy. Yanqiu's belly is probably also a sacred embryo formed by cultivation? Just kidding!

In the past ten years or so, whenever I see the trial scene of "Yu Tangchun," the three high-ranking officials sitting majestically in the hall ask questions in a funny and frivolous manner, like child's play, not like high-ranking officials of the court, but like three crosstalk comedians. Recently, it has become even worse and more unruly. I always feel resentful. Now, watching the supporting actors that Yanqiu brought with her, Gu Jusun, Zhang Chunyan, and the other three, who played the Imperial Inspector, the Provincial Governor, and the Judicial Commissioner, respectively, infused the spirit of questioning and answering into the singing of "Yu Tangchun," their manner was gentle and disciplined, and their tone was restrained and slightly revealed, which is worthy of praise and promotion. I will now write it in large letters to tell the world that all good plays are arbitrarily ruined by vulgar actors. The task of correcting them lies with enlightened people. Drama is of great importance to popular education. I hope that the social intellectual class will study it more and take on the responsibility of improvement, so that all plays may have a day of glory.

Chapter 18 Trying to Sweep Away the Huns, Regardless of Oneself

Wu Sangui heard Zhang Cangqiu's questioning very sternly, so he replied with a serious expression: "Battalion Commander Zhang, you don't know that the enemy is numerous and we are few. The outcome of the battle cannot be predicted. I want to quickly stabilize the Ming Dynasty and wipe out the rebel bandits, so I temporarily abandoned the hatred with Manchuria and made peace with them, imitating Shen Baoxu's begging for help from a foreign country to stabilize the overall situation. This is also a temporary expedient measure. Fortunately, Dorgon has agreed to send troops, and the Qing army will enter the pass soon. We should quickly work together to attack the rebels and restore the capital. This is the best policy, which others do not know." Zhang Cangqiu said: "A good best policy. This humble general dares to say that this is the worst policy. We will definitely suffer from the Qing army in the future. The Qing army is our hereditary enemy. They have been eyeing us from outside the pass and are growing stronger. We are afraid that we will not be able to prevent them, how can we guide them into the pass and create an opportunity for them to occupy the Central Plains? We must rely on our own strength to attack the rebel bandits. The power of foreigners cannot be relied upon. If internal strife is quelled one day, foreign disasters will arise again. Isn't this making the land of China more vulnerable to future military disasters? Therefore, this humble general and others came to see you to ask the Prince of Pingxi to quickly write a letter to decline and delay their troops, and then think about a plan to eliminate the rebel bandits on your own. With the Prince of Pingxi's talent and the army's dedication, as well as the righteous armies rising up everywhere to defend the king, the rebel bandits are ultimately a mob. If they are lucky enough to win, they will be rampant for a while, but it will not be difficult to gradually destroy them. Therefore, this humble general believes that the rebel bandits are to be feared but not enough to be feared, and the Qing army is to be feared but cannot be approached. I hope the Prince of Pingxi will make a decision early and not leave regrets." Zhang Cangqiu spoke eloquently, with a righteous tone and a voice like a bell. Wu Sangui's face changed involuntarily. He was ultimately unhappy because Zhang Cangqiu and others refused to help him save Chen Yuanyuan, and Zhang Cangqiu's words today were very straightforward and often offensive, which made him even more annoyed.

Elephant 1 retreats 3, Chariot 2 moves horizontally to 3, Elephant 3 advances 1 (Correct Draw) Next Issue will Continue to Show the Variation

Variation: General 6 retreats 1, Elephant 1 advances 3, Chariot 2 retreats 3, General 6 advances 1, Chariot 2 moves horizontally to 8

Chariot 5 advances 1, Chariot 8 moves horizontally to 4, General 6 moves horizontally to 5, Chariot 4 moves horizontally to 6, General 5 moves horizontally to 6

Chariot 6 approaches 1, Elephant 3 retreats 5, Chariot 6 retreats 2, Elephant 5 retreats 7, Chariot 6 moves horizontally to 3

(Elephant is dead, Red wins) The list of correctly guessing names is on the left: (All guessed correctly) Bao Hanliang, Tao Ziwen, Wu Ming. (Guessed the correct draw) He Yulin, Lu Yukang, Mao Wenlong. The above six gentlemen will be slightly rewarded and mailed today. Wu Youqing Qi The Black side's response in this game was slightly flawed, resulting in a Red victory. Therefore, after Black's Elephant 5 advances 3, it can retreat 1 and retreat 3, and then advance 1 three times, which is the correct draw. In the variation, the Elephant advances 3 again, causing Red's Chariot 2 to retreat 3 to kill, and then moves horizontally to 8 to suppress the sleeping Elephant, forcing Black to move the Chariot on the fifth rank. Advancing 1 is walking horizontally to 6, then Red's Chariot moves horizontally to 5 to occupy the center and win again, for the research of fellow enthusiasts. (Editor)
