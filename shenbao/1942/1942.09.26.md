### Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces Naval Advance into the Atlantic, Joint Offensive with German Submarines

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency)

Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 25th: 
(1) A portion of the Imperial Japanese Navy has advanced into the Atlantic Ocean to engage in combat operations alongside the Axis navies. 
(2) This operational endeavor of the Imperial Japanese Navy within the German operational area in the Atlantic, along with a portion of the German naval forces operating in the Indian Ocean, holds profound significance in the context of collaborative Axis naval operations. 
(3) One of the Imperial Japanese submarines operating in the Atlantic recently docked at a German naval base in Europe and has now redeployed to the operational area.

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency)

More than ten months have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese forces have not only secured key strategic locations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans but also control vast expanses of sea from the Aleutian Islands in the north to southern Australia. According to the Imperial Japanese Headquarters' announcement today, the Japanese Navy, in addition to deploying strong defenses in the aforementioned regions, has also dispatched a portion of its forces to the Atlantic to launch a new offensive against the Allied forces within the German operational area. Japanese submarines have docked at a German naval base and then redeployed, while German submarines are also active in the Indian Ocean. In this way, the Axis navies have directly demonstrated to the world their collaborative efforts to control the global sea lanes. The Japanese Navy, facing the world's major navies of Britain and the United States and engaging in several large-scale naval battles in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, has repeatedly destroyed the enemy's main naval forces, fully demonstrating the strength of the Japanese Navy. This time, by shifting a portion of its forces to the Atlantic, it poses a serious threat to the Allied forces. At the same time, German naval power is expanding into the Indian Ocean. One can imagine the distress of the Allied forces at this time. The Axis navies, having joined forces on the seas before the second anniversary of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy on the 27th of this month, will further enhance their close coordination and launch a new offensive against the Allied forces. There is no doubt that this will inflict a fundamental blow to the Allied navies.

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency)

The appearance of the Japanese Navy at a German base in the Atlantic has not only greatly pleased the German people but has also convinced everyone that the Atlantic war has been strengthened by the participation of the Japanese Navy, increasing the strength of the Tripartite Pact nations. It can be said that the outcome has already been decided. The fact that the Japanese and Italian forces have sailed over 20,000 kilometers to the Atlantic is even more astonishing to everyone. Naval experts in Berlin also believe that this will bring about significant changes in the maritime war situation, further demonstrating the broad scope of cooperation among the Tripartite Pact nations. While the Allied nations engage in empty talk and publicly discuss their strategic plans, the Tripartite Pact nations are pragmatic, taking practical actions with lightning speed.

### Fierce Soviet Counteroffensive Northwest of Stalingrad, Hand-to-Hand Combat Engages, Multiple German Aircraft Transport Reinforcements to Assist

Kyoto, Switzerland, 25th (Domei News Agency)

The battle for Stalingrad has reached its thirty-first day, with both sides still engaged in bloody fighting. Yesterday alone, 200 German tanks fiercely attacked the left flank of the defending forces twelve times without any progress. The German forces are transporting reinforcements by plane to assist. Soviet troops are also launching a fierce counteroffensive in the northwest of the city. According to Berlin sources, this Soviet counteroffensive has been defeated, and 34 tanks have been destroyed.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 24th (Havas News Agency)

On the 459th day of the German-Soviet War, the fighting continues to be centered on the city of Stalingrad. The fall of the city is still considered to be a matter of time. The remaining Red Army positions within the city are surrounded on all sides, but the Red Army's resistance remains extremely strong, even launching fierce counteroffensives several times. According to Soviet sources, the German forces attempted to break into the city center with hundreds of tanks but were repelled. Although the German forces have exhausted all means, they have not been able to advance in the southwest and northwest areas of the city. However, in the central area of the city, the German forces have managed to expand the gap in the Red Army's positions, reaching the banks of the Volga River, and have advanced along the river, occupying the port and shipyards. The German intention is to cut off the supply lines of the defending forces in Stalingrad, leaving the remnants of the Red Army trapped amidst the rubble and deprived of supplies, awaiting their doom.

Rome, 24th (Havas News Agency)

A visiting Italian war correspondent has recently telegraphed from the front lines that the battle for Stalingrad is still ongoing and is probably one of the most fierce battles of the current war. Although the Axis forces are continuing to advance, they have suffered extremely heavy casualties. According to a telegram from an Italian newspaper's war correspondent, such a large battle cannot be accomplished in one stroke and will inevitably take time. In Stalingrad, it is impossible to adopt a blitzkrieg strategy. The defending forces are hiding behind the rubble, making use of the walls in the streets and alleys as their headquarters. Unless we are willing to sacrifice the lives of our soldiers, we cannot advance rapidly. Therefore, we must proceed step by step. In addition, the Red Army infantry has repeatedly launched counteroffensives, although they have not achieved any success so far. However, the Red Army's morale is surprisingly high. Judging from the Red Army's courageous fighting, it is believed that a large number of weapons are still stored in the city, and the enemy has probably transferred a large number of reinforcements to reinforce the city several days ago. Therefore, the Red Army's resistance has not collapsed. The Red Army's headquarters is therefore still able to prolong the fierce battle within the city. In addition, the Italian newspapers are also paying attention to the fighting in the Caucasus region, especially in the Terek River basin. However, the German High Command is keeping silent about the fighting there. According to information obtained by the Italian newspapers, the Red Army is attempting to recapture the city of Prokhladny, in order to cut off the German forces' transportation lines. However, this Red Army force has been repelled, and the German forces have already begun to launch an offensive that threatens to encircle the Red Army.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 24th (Havas News Agency)

The Soviet official news agency, TASS, issued a message today stating that the German forces and their allied forces have increased their pressure on Stalingrad. The German forces are constantly bombarding the city, disregarding any significant losses, and are still sending motorized units and tank units to the front lines. The Soviet defending forces are holding their original positions and will stand firm to the end. Every house and every street corner will be defended. Even if the first floor has been occupied by the Germans, the fighting will not stop, and resistance will continue from the upper floors with hand grenades. Since the German forces entered Stalingrad, hand-to-hand combat has occurred repeatedly. Yesterday, the Red Army and the Romanian army engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and the Romanian army suffered heavy casualties. The situation in the Caucasus region is also very tense. The German forces have transferred a large number of reinforcements to assist. Tank units that have just been transferred from other locations have already joined the battle. On the south bank of the Terek River, the German forces are intensifying their operations, attempting to expand their foothold. Although the German forces have suffered heavy losses, they are continuing their offensive.

Moscow, 24th (Havas News Agency)

The Red Army High Command has just released a war report stating that on the 24th of this month, our forces engaged in fierce battles with the German forces in Stalingrad, Mozdok (central Caucasus), and Sinyavino. In the northwest of Stalingrad, our forces continued to advance, and the fierce fighting has not yet ended. There have been no significant changes on other lines.

Kyoto, Sweden, 25th (Havas News Agency)

The battle for Stalingrad is still raging. There have been no major changes in the front lines of the two armies. Neutral observers have now shifted their attention to the Caucasus region, where the German authorities intend to use all their strength to occupy as many strongholds as possible in the weeks before winter.

### Anniversary of Japan-Germany-Italy Pact, Embassy Holds Scheduled Tea Party, Explains Significance to Reporters Yesterday Afternoon

Shanghai (Central News Agency) The second anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Germany-Italy Pact falls on the 27th of this month. Minister Horinouchi of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai will hold a grand tea party to celebrate with the authorities and heads of various agencies stationed in Shanghai by Germany, Italy, and Manchukuo. Mr. Hirota, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy, also hosted a cordial discussion for the Chinese press corps at the Broadway Mansions at 2:30 PM on the 25th. Director Hirota, accompanied by Vice-Consul Fukuda, extended a warm welcome. Director Hirota explained the significance of the celebration at the meeting, which lasted for an hour and a half. It was the first time Director Hirota had met with reporters from various newspapers in Shanghai since taking office. A record of Mr. Hirota's remarks follows:

Director Hirota Explains Significance

The day after tomorrow (the 27th) marks the second anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Germany-Italy Pact. Minister Horinouchi of our Embassy will hold a grand tea party from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road to celebrate with the heads and distinguished guests of various Chinese, Japanese, German, Italian, and Manchukuo agencies in Shanghai. Envoys from Germany and Italy will personally attend the ceremony. Therefore, our Director is meeting with your country's press corps today to explain the significance of celebrating the anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Germany-Italy Pact. Everyone present understands the purpose of the Japan-Germany-Italy alliance. The most important central point of the treaty, which our Emperor graciously issued in a rescript, can be briefly summarized as securing lasting peace as a prerequisite and establishing a new world order as the true meaning of the alliance, which we must accomplish and achieve. After the signing of the alliance treaty by our three countries, Germany and Italy in Europe first began fighting against Britain and France, but based on the meaning of the treaty, they sought to resolve the situation through peaceful means. However, Britain and the United States did not approve of this and instead adopted strong and illegal measures to threaten our Axis group, which led to the outbreak of the war. Today, Japan is also standing up to the violence of Britain and the United States in Asia. After the opening of the Greater East Asia War, the three Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy signed an additional treaty on the eleventh of that month, which stipulated that: (1) there will be no armistice until victory is achieved in the war against Britain and the United States; (2) there will be no separate peace negotiations before the war is completed; (3) after the war is completed, Japan, Germany, and Italy will cooperate to build a truly permanent new world order. After the signing of this new supplementary agreement, Japan, Germany, and Italy have a strong and united front to fight together. Today, in Asia, Japan has achieved a position of certain victory and is fully responsible for a long-term war, while in Europe, Germany and Italy have also achieved a position of certain victory and invincibility. Therefore, East Asia and Europe are united, adhering to the principles of the treaty, and believing that the position of the Allied powers is in imminent danger. Recently, there have been rumors of calls for peace negotiations. It is difficult to determine whether this is true, but based on the circumstances, this is possible. We will not consider these maneuvers by Britain and the United States. On the contrary, since Japan, Germany, and Italy have signed a treaty, they should fulfill their alliance obligations and resolutely establish a new world order, not stopping until the final goal is achieved.

### Headquarters of the National Army Dissolves Itself, Commander-in-Chief Ou Publishes Statement

### British Government Restricts Domestic Consumption, Parliament to Reconvene Early Next Month, Will Discuss Important Issues

London, 24th (Havas News Agency)

After the summer recess, the British Parliament will reconvene early next month, at which time it will discuss various important issues. However, it is expected that the government will not present any reports on the political situation. The so-called important issues are nothing more than: (1) the fuel shortage problem. In general, there seems to be difficulty in implementing fuel consumption restrictions. If the government takes action in the future, it will be severely criticized, but it is expected that this bill will still be proposed by the government or the majority party members. (2) The issue of extending the term of the current members of Parliament for a year. (3) The turmoil in Northern Ireland. (4) The Indian issue. (5) The issue of raising the salaries of diplomats. (6) The issue of preventing inflation.

London, 24th (Havas News Agency)

### French Forces in Madagascar Continue Resistance

Vichy, 25th (Haitong News Agency)

The French Colonial Department issued a statement yesterday stating that although Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, has fallen, the French forces will continue to resist on the island. Governor Annet has withdrawn with his troops to the interior, so the French flag continues to fly over the island of Madagascar. According to responsible sources here, the Governor of Madagascar maintains contact with Vichy from time to time, and rumors that Vichy instructed Annet to return home are untrue. Informed sources also say that the occupation of Antananarivo only marks the end of the first phase of French resistance, while the second phase of resistance will be launched by the commander of the French forces in Madagascar.

Vichy, 24th (Havas News Agency)

After the fall of the capital of Madagascar, Colonial Minister Br√©vi√© telegraphed Governor Annet of the island with words of comfort and encouragement, saying that although he was defeated with fewer soldiers than the enemy, he was still glorious. The loyalty and patriotism of the island's soldiers and civilians are commendable, and their spirit of sacrifice will be immortalized in our country's history. He hoped that this message would be conveyed to the soldiers and civilians to convey the government's deep respect. Although Antananarivo has fallen, it is believed that he and others will still be able to unite and continue to struggle with an unyielding spirit. Our government has high hopes for them.

### In the Midst of Lighting Restriction Announcements, Streetlights Begin to be Dismantled: Approximately 500 Streetlights to Remain on Both Sides of the Suzhou Creek; Stricter General Restrictions to be Implemented Next Month

The air raid lighting restrictions to be universally implemented citywide from the 1st to the 10th of next month will be much stricter than the last ones. During these ten days, the lighting restrictions will not be based on prior notification but will simulate a sudden emergency. Under these circumstances, citizens must proactively and completely control all lights upon hearing an alarm or receiving an order. Generally, there will be several hours of training each day. The beginning and end of the lighting restrictions will be determined by the Supreme Air Defense Command through special passes, and the orders will be broadcast by the Greater East Asia Radio Station. If necessary, announcements will be issued to ensure that the two concessions act in complete parallel in their implementation.

Dismantling Work to be Completed by the End of the Month

According to a certain high-ranking official of the Public Concession Police Department's Air Defense Committee, work on dismantling streetlights south of the Suzhou Creek has already begun and will be completed by the end of this month. At that time, only one-tenth of the usual number of streetlights will remain in the entire area of the Public Concession. This is a preparatory measure amidst the air defense announcements in the city. By then, of the original 5,700 streetlights north and south of the Suzhou Creek, only 570 will remain. However, this method is only of a trial nature. If necessary, the number of streetlights will be increased or decreased again. The streetlights in the central district and Chengdu Road area were reduced on the night of the 23rd, while the Jing'an Temple Road area was reduced on the night of the 24th. The Lao Zha District has also started this work. As for the streetlights in Hongkou, they have already been reduced, leaving only the most essential ones. Preparations for the large-scale lighting control exercise from October 1st to 10th are nearing completion. The only remaining task is to ensure that more citizens are aware of their part in the lighting control, so the responsible parties will hold exercises in more districts. Furthermore, a spokesperson for the French Concession Police Department stated that the French Concession is also conducting similar exercises every night, but has not specified the model districts for exercises to be held in the coming nights of this month.

Observation Posts to be Set Up for Incendiary Bombs

It has also been learned that during the ten-day lighting restriction period in early October, all fire brigades in the Public Concession will be on standby. As soon as an air raid siren sounds, they will be dispatched immediately. A number of ambulances will be prepositioned in densely populated areas for immediate use. Exercises to extinguish incendiary bombs will be conducted in the Nanjing Road area. Observation posts will be set up at key locations to detect the landing points of incendiary bombs and issue an alert immediately. At this time, volunteer firefighters will also participate in the work. Ambulance teams from the Health Department will also be dispatched. In the French Concession, fire prevention, rescue, and other air defense-related work will be planned and coordinated by the Fire Department, Health Department, and Public Works Department.

Hongkou Exercises Extremely Tense

The Public Concession continues to implement lighting control drills by district. According to the Police Department, lighting control exercises will be held on Yulin Road between Huade Road and Dalianwan Road for residences and shops from 8:00 PM to 10:30 PM last night. Matsumoto, the head of the Air Defense Section of the Police Department, personally inspected the area during the exercise. It is also confirmed that the designated Yulin Road area will continue to implement lighting control at the same time tonight, and windows should also be covered with curtains. Tonight, from 8:00 PM to 10:30 PM, lighting control exercises will also be held in the area within Wusong Road, Wuchang Road, Miller Road, and Tiantong Road in the Hongkou Police District, and Matsumoto will again be present to observe. Furthermore, on Wednesday night, Jing'an Temple Road between Carter Road and Xieqiao Lane was dark, but this was actually only a trial by the Baojia chiefs in the area and not a formal lighting control exercise in the area.

### Personnel Selection for Foreign Baojia Corps

The English-language "The China Press" reported that the Foreign Baojia Corps in six police districts north of the Suzhou Creek will begin to be established on October 1st. The personnel for their service were decided at a meeting held at the Wayside Police Station at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from the Public Concession Police Department's Baojia Section, the Russian Emigrant Committee, and the Jewish Emigrant Committee attended.

Brief Biographies of Six Selected Russian √âmigr√©s

The number of positions designated for Jewish √©migr√©s is still unknown. However, it has been learned that the Russian √âmigr√© Committee has already selected six Baojia officials to attend the meeting, and these six officials will be approved at the meeting. The six Russian √©migr√©s selected are Peshen, Dubrovin, Davydov, Konstantinonov, Pikeppes, Tokhov, and Derigan, who reside in the Wayside District, Hongkou District, and Yangshupu District. They are scheduled to begin work on October 1st. The foreign Baojia area includes six districts: Jiaxing Road District, Hongkou District, West Hongkou District, Wayside District, Yulin District, and Yangshupu District.

Approximately 5,000 Foreigners to Serve

It is now expected that approximately 5,000 people will be selected to serve in the Baojia organization north of the Suzhou Creek. It is understood that only 400 to 500 of them are White Russians. It is expected that the Police Department will issue notices, and Japanese and other foreign police stations will also dispatch officers to be responsible for guiding the foreign Self-Defense Corps members in their posts and inspections. At the same time, it is also confirmed that the French Concession authorities do not have any plans to organize a Baojia Corps to carry out their efforts. However, it is almost certain that this type of organization will eventually be adopted.

### Spitting in Public Places Prohibited

The Public Works Department recently issued Municipal Announcement No. 6105, stating that from this date onwards, the license rules for all licensed premises will include the following rule: "The licensee shall take various precautionary measures to prevent spitting in the premises and shall endeavor to post warning notices in conspicuous places."

### French Concession Civil Police Corps Police Booths Completed

Since the establishment of the French Concession Civil Police Corps, the second step was to build a large number of police booths. These police booths have now been completed and are currently piled up at the B√©thune Road Police Station grounds and across from the Shanzhong Road Police Station at the intersection of Rue Amiral Courbet. The color they are painted is gray-black, and the area is slightly larger than the Public Concession police booths. It is said that the total number of these police booths is 400, which will be placed on the edge of the important roads in the French Concession for the civil police corps to guard.

### Extension Granted for Silver and Money Industry Businesses to Complete Supplementary Registration; Agreed Method for Dividing Capital for Branches

The Joint Committee of Silver and Money Industry Trade Associations, in view of the issue of member businesses completing supplementary registration, which according to regulations was to be completed by October 20th, specially petitioned the competent authorities to request an extension. After discussion, it was decided to extend the deadline for supplementary registration by one month to October 20th. Three agreed-upon methods for supplementary registration were communicated to member businesses yesterday. These methods are: (1) Those who have obtained a business license from the former Ministry of Finance may request verification and issuance of a new business license, with registration fees reduced by half. Those who have not applied for a license or permission shall follow the bank registration regulations. (2) The capital of each business, whether it is a head office or a branch, should be calculated entirely in Central Reserve Certificates (CRC). Those that have not yet been converted should be converted into CRC at a rate of two to one. (3) Head offices of businesses that are located inland should list the total capital of the head office. The capital item in their balance sheet should list the operating capital of the Shanghai branch itself. If the branch has not been allocated separate capital, it should state that no separate capital has been allocated.

### Revision to Method for Foreigners to Change ID Cards

Those with P should return them to the B√©thune District Police Station, F to the Foch District Police Station, C to the Central Police Station, J to the Avenue Joffre Police Station, and M to the Rue Massenet Police Station. It was found that foreigners in the Public Concession are also limited to returning their citizen certificates to the responsible police station by the end of this month due to revisions in the method.

Travel Communications

### Trip to Hangzhou (Part 1)

‚Äî Qian Zhiren

Having been confined to Shanghai for five years, not only have I not left Shanghai, but I have not even left the concessions. Feeling really stifled, I resolutely took a few savings deposit slips and went to Hangzhou alone for a trip. Naturally, I had to prepare travel passes, epidemic prevention certificates, and other documents in advance. The one-way express train fare in third class already cost many savings deposit slips. However, since the purpose was to travel, the savings were naturally minimal. The passengers in the third-class carriage were either small merchants or the wives and concubines of deputy squad leaders. They were smoking Green Tin Package cigarettes and eating melon seeds, just as carefree as they were before the war.

The female staff selling candies and cigarettes in the car were neatly dressed and had clear features, reminding me of the female staff at the New Asia Restaurant in the past. The candies were all wrapped in cellophane, and each package had a piece of paper with the words "Local Specialty" printed on it in four-point Western characters. However, there was no shop brand, so it probably wasn't a product of a Chinese shop. Many passengers bought candies, each package costing about 1.5 yuan in savings deposit slips. The scenery outside the train window remained the same, except for the many bamboo fences. From Shanghai to Hangzhou, they were almost continuous, marking the "Cleansing the Villages" campaign. When the train arrived at the city station, the red-capped porters shouted in unison, giving a bit of a feeling of having arrived in Tokyo (translated). Since I was traveling alone, I was inspected for epidemic prevention certificates, went through the Chinese route, had my body searched, and walked out of the station.

Looking up from the station, the City Station Hotel on the right was still standing tall, but the doors were covered with wooden boards. This ancient building probably won't be demolished, and in the future, it will only be destined to become a cargo warehouse. Many of the large stores in the city have changed their content and their signboards, and some have even changed their nationality. For example, a large silver shop has been changed into a paper shop, and the Central Bank has been changed into a club. I rushed to my friend's house. My friend's house was a large courtyard with a garden and a flower hall, no less than Hu Xueyan's large residence. Sitting in a grand master chair and drinking clear tea in this large house, facing all the old decorations inherited from previous generations, it really felt like I was being pulled back to my childhood.

### Hangzhou's Food

My friend's priorities were: first, cigarettes and tea; second, snacks; and third, banquets. It was all about eating. In normal times, eating seems to be the easiest and most ordinary thing. Now, eating has become the most important thing. Even the most ordinary meals make people drool. Not to mention a table full of chicken, duck, fish, and meat, and the ingredients are fresh and the chef's skills are high.

The price of fresh meat in Hangzhou is eight yuan per catty, which doesn't seem cheap. But for eight yuan, you can really buy meat, unlike in Shanghai where there is a price but no goods. Tender chicken is 6.5 yuan per catty, and fish and shrimp are even cheaper. Big Qing fish is the most expensive, selling for only five corners per tael, and shrimp are three to four corners per tael. They are all the freshest of the fresh.

### Post-Holiday Stock Market Progresses: New Stocks Rise Even Faster

With the peak rising, the determination of all parties is solid. The reason is that the market was still able to rise before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Sellers were even more reluctant to sell after the holiday, and those seeking to buy were even more willing to pay high prices. According to the psychology of the industry, the money supply is not as tight as before the holiday, and there is abundant floating capital. The future is likely to continue to rise, and the target is more focused on the new stocks that have recently appeared on the market. For example, Da Zhonghua Weaving has risen to an abnormal price of 11.75 yuan, and Hongsheng has reached 11 yuan, with the former rising 5 corners and the latter adding 7.5 corners. Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving reached a high price of 18 yuan, rising 5 corners. An Da Shirts once reached 27 yuan, up 1 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Weaving remained flat at around 34 yuan, down only 2.5 corners. Wing On Textile once again reached a high price of 1,775 yuan. Standard Paper suddenly rose 5 corners to reach 15 yuan, with buying momentum increasing daily. Nanyang Tobacco knocked on the 100 yuan mark and then fell back, but still rose 1 yuan overall. Da Zhonghua Matches came out of 200 yuan, reaching 207.5 yuan, finally rising 7.5 yuan. Culture Enterprise Commercial Press reached 295 yuan, rising 5 yuan. Zhonghua also added 2.5 yuan. Shijie came out of the 60 yuan mark, rising 3 yuan, all rising without turning back. In the department store industry, Wing On and Guohuo both came out of the 120 yuan mark. Sincere reached 119 yuan, rising 4.5 yuan to 1 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Minyi fell 1.5 yuan, Sino-French rose 2.5 yuan, New Asia added 1 yuan, and Wuzhou reached 300 yuan, rising 5 yuan. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity reached a maximum of 41 yuan, finally rising 5 corners. Huashang Electric was flat at around 34 yuan. Trading was busy, as listed below:

### Government Bonds Still Fluctuate Greatly

The over-the-counter trading situation of government bonds still fluctuated greatly, with the difference between high and low prices still as high as two yuan. Trading was also not deserted, but the market price was somewhat chaotic, causing the various bonds to have discrepancies. The initial trading situation was very strong, with Type C once rising as high as 8 yuan and 78 corners. Later, due to long positions taking profit, the market suddenly plummeted to 6 yuan and 8 corners. After entering, there was a slight compensation, and then it rebounded slightly again. The final price was similar to the previous day's market price, and it seemed that there was no decline in popularity. Generally, one side was adding long positions and one side was taking profit, but those who made up for it were also quite enthusiastic at first. However, Type A and B were still smaller and more abnormal than Type C, probably due to the difference in discarding and taking. There is still no verification of the transaction.

### Price of Gold Ornaments Unchanged

Yesterday, the door price of gold ornaments in the Dashin Tongxing jewelry stores in the city was still 2,450 yuan per tael (purchase price minus slightly less than 300 yuan). The price of doing business with each other in the industry was still slightly up, initially as high as 15 yuan to 2,240 yuan. Soon, it rose from 2,235 yuan to 2,260 yuan. At noon, it slightly fell back. At noon, it was 2,245 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan to 25 yuan. Transactions were sparse. The door price of jewelry patterned silver was still 14 yuan per tael. The price of doing business with each other in the industry was 3 yuan and 12 corners.

### Military Certificates Stable

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was quite stable. The price of doing business with each other in the industry was 5 yuan, 5 corners, 5 points, and 35 mils. The sales price in the banks and small money shops was 5 yuan, 5 corners, and 6.5 points, and the purchase price was 4.5 points, which has been flat for five days. Yesterday, the money industry association's interest rate of 1 corner and 4 points was not changed.

### Cotton Cloth Falls Back

Factory Cloth

Yesterday, the market turned tired due to the fall in East Cloth. However, the Fine Cloth of the factory team was still stable without honor or disgrace, but the tone was slightly relaxed. 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was still called 190 yuan, Flying Hong 187 yuan, and 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth 165.5 yuan had sales. Great Peng 157.5 yuan, Fuguai 154 yuan, Peach Ladies Linen started at 258.5 yuan and softened to 257 yuan, falling 2 yuan per piece.

East Cloth

The foreign firm side had sales of Fine Cloth and Drill, both trending downstream. The new price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth was 177.5 yuan at Sincere, down 1.25 yuan. The bank's orders fell more fiercely. The closing price at noon was 162.5 yuan. Color Ball Fine Cloth 162.5 yuan, Flying Fish 160 yuan, Four Gentlemen's Drill Red list started at 7 yuan and 2 corners and fell to 7 yuan, 1 corner, and 6 points, a fall of 1 corner and 1.5 points compared to before the holiday. Bank's order Drill 6 yuan and 9 corners was also very weak.

### Large Batch of Soybeans Delivered

The supply and demand of beans was still quiet yesterday, and trading was scarce. The underlying trend was quite strong. More than ten packages of Tianjin Red Beans were priced at 163 yuan. Ten packages of Wujiang Selected Green were priced at 208 yuan.

The arrival and sales of sweet potato dried were balanced, and the market trend turned stable. Yesterday, 105 packages of Qingdao sweet potato dried were opened at a price of 142 yuan.

Corn was scarce and trending upwards. One cart of Wuhu Corn was priced at 133 yuan.

It has been several days since the allocation of miscellaneous grains and coarse beans was interrupted. It is heard that 300 tons of soybeans have been shipped to Shanghai via the Huai River, and a large batch is still on the way and will be restored soon.

### Kuilan Bamboo Branches Have Arrived

Since the new season of Zhangzhou branches and trunks arrived, most of them have been the unified goods, but only this time have Kuilan bamboo branches arrived with more than ten pieces. The samples will probably be available next week. Since the cost and expenses are high, the opening price will certainly not be cheap, and since the number is small, they will be even scarcer.

### Coarse Sugar Share Started Strong and Ended Weak

Yesterday, the sugar share market of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office was as follows: The opening price of coarse sugar shares was 304 yuan, which was 1 yuan better than the previous market. Continuing with mediocre trading, the closing price was still 303 yuan, forming a trend of starting strong and ending weak. The opening price of red sugar shares was 300 yuan, with no major change from the previous day. The total turnover was 1,100 bags.

### Cigarette Prices Rise Easily, Fall With Difficulty

Due to sustained buying and selling, cigarette market prices have risen easily and fallen with difficulty. For example, "Great Britain" brand has gradually risen to 1,400 yuan, "Old Knife" brand to 6,550 yuan, "Pinhai" brand to 6,250 yuan, "Wuhua" brand to 5,400 yuan, and "Fairy" brand to 5,200 yuan, all increasing by about 150 yuan compared to before. Japanese cigarettes are scarce and expensive, and because transactions are very rare, the market price is stable and does not move. "Golden Gun" brand is 1,600 yuan, "Golden Building" is 2,800 yuan, "Red Rose" is 2,000 yuan, "Golden Fortune" is 2,850 yuan, "Nian Zhi Zhuang" is 2,650 yuan, and "Compass" is 2,300 yuan. Domestic cigarettes show mixed performance; "Pyramid" brand is priced at 5,100 yuan, "Beautiful" brand medium box price is 4,500 yuan, "Golden Mouse" brand is 3,150 yuan, "White Gold Dragon" is 3,100 yuan, and "Golden Dragon" is 2,850 yuan.

### A Week's Worth of Opera News

‚Äî Master of Plum Blossom Hall

The entire Song De Zhu Opera Troupe, except for Wang Yu Rang, Ci Shao Quan, Guan De Xian, Gao De Song, Li Sheng Zuo, Guo Ban Tian, Wang Jin Lu, Chu Jin Peng, and Xiao De Yin, who were retained and re-employed, all traveled north by train on the 22nd. However, Song De Zhu himself has some private matters to attend to and will need to linger for a few more days, and is expected to embark on his journey north towards the end of the month.

The opera performances recently held at Wu's residence in Mai Kai Chun Road, Sui Nong Villa, were quite remarkable in terms of both the cast and the repertoire. The program included: 1) "Mei Long Town" performed by Cao Hui Lin and Li Hui Fang; 2) "Lin Chong Flees at Night" performed by Wang Jin Lu; 3) "Empty City Stratagem" performed by Li He Zeng and Gao De Song; 4) "Makeup and Kneeling Pool" performed by Yu Zhen Fei, Zhang Chuan Fang, and Zheng Chuan Jian; 5) "Woman Escorted" performed by Wang Zhu Rong, Guan Sheng Ji, and Li Sheng Fang; 6) "Little Shepherd Boy" performed by Song De Zhu and Ye Sheng Zhang; 7) "New Cotton Spinning" performed by Wu Su Qiu and Liu Bin Kun. Miss Chuan Yun Tai also made a special appearance at night to perform "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao," with her teacher, Mr. Su Shao Qing, providing accompaniment on the qin. Such a gathering of renowned actors was truly a rare and grand occasion.

Wang Yu, Lao Bao, and Zhou Xiao Tian performed at the Queen's Theater on the 19th, with ticket prices selling for 18 yuan, breaking the unprecedented record in Shanghai. The first night featured "Visiting Mother," the second night "Losing the City, Chopping Ma Su," and the third night "Wang Baochuan," all selling out. The new actors from Geng Xin Opera Troupe, Li Zong Yi and Li Yu Zhi, performed on stage on the 23rd, with a repertoire similar to that of Wang and Zhou at the Queen's Theater, with the first day featuring "Visiting Mother," the second day "Zhu Tang Chun, Losing the City, Chopping Ma Su," and the third day the complete "Wang Baochuan." The difference lies in the fact that the Queen's Theater emphasizes the female roles, while Geng Xin places more emphasis on the performance itself. Li Zong Yi, a disciple of the old actor Bao Ji Xiang, has profound skills and a voice so powerful that few can rival him among actors. I found "Visiting Mother" and "Empty City Stratagem" to be quite satisfactory. Li Yu Zhi, one of the "Four Jade" of the opera school, is excellent in both singing and acting, and her voice is sufficient. Her performance of "Yu Tang Chun" on the second day, personally taught by Cheng Yan Qiu, was filled with beautiful melodies and received much acclaim. It is also said that Yu Zhi's performance of "Peacock Flies Southeast" was also corrected by Yan Qiu, and the performance is quite remarkable. Rehearsals are scheduled to begin next Tuesday and Wednesday.

Wu Su Qiu's "Spinning Cotton" is undeniably popular. Since taking the stage, it has been performed four times, selling out every time. Other plays, such as "Pan Qiao Yun," "Yu Tang Chun," and "Peacock Flies Southeast," are also popular, but not as enthusiastically as "Spinning Cotton."

### Heavy Losses for Fu Lian Cheng Society

‚Äî Jie

The Hua Le Theater was reduced to ashes. Renowned actor Ye Sheng Zhang, who recently performed in the Golden Concert, received a telegram from Peiping reporting that the Hua Le Theater had been tragically destroyed by fire, resulting in heavy losses. Hua Le is one of the major theaters in the old capital, with a history of fifty or sixty years. All of the Fu Lian Cheng Society's new costumes, props, and other items, worth over 500,000 yuan, which were managed by the Ye brothers and stored in Hua Le, have been turned to ashes. Although fire insurance was held, it was not sufficient to cover the losses, resulting in a significant setback. The Ye brothers have suffered a great disaster, and their distress is beyond words.

### The First Shot of Zhong Zhong, After Watching "Spring River Flower Moon Night"

‚Äî Wei Ren

"Spring River Flower Moon Night" is Zhong Zhong's first shot at the Li Hua Theater. The plot tells the story of the absurdity and debauchery of two theater owners, thereby introducing the various behind-the-scenes secrets of the stage. The dialogue is very vivid, but unfortunately, the development of the story does not align with general facts, so some points are somewhat forced and stiff.

In terms of the cast, Sun Jing Lu's Fang Xue Mei is the most successful. Her every word, every action, is so comfortable and leaves an unforgettable impression. Naturally, her fluent Mandarin, clear voice, and overflowing enthusiasm are her natural talents and the fruits of her efforts. Wu Yang's Qin Jing Ru performs steadily and skillfully. Leng Shan's Yuan Di Chen is quite fitting, and his lines are also powerful. Wu Jing Ping's Chen Han Qiu accounts for every movement, and his facial expressions are meticulously portrayed. Fei Yin's Liu Qian Yu is gentle and refined, and Sha Mo's Xiao Ru Yi is lively and adorable. Wu Chun Zhen's Liu Mu has a special effect with her nose-wiping movements. Shao Hua's Zhang Hong Sheng makes good use of the large fan in his performance, which is quite clever. Ma Xiao Nong's Jin Xue Yan has few scenes but is very pleasing. Others, such as Bo's servant, Lei Ming's Liang Er, Li Jie's A Si, Ge Tan's Li Zhu Er, Tian Bin's Fei Hua, Zhong Yu Ting, Xu Dian's Wang Wen De, etc., also perform their duties.

The stage design is simple and delicate, the lighting is bright and dazzling, and the effects are well-coordinated.

This is a lighthearted comedy worth recommending to all those who love spoken drama.

Miscellaneous Notes on Entertainment

### Playing the Flower Drum

‚Äî Ze Fu

It is said that the flower drum originated in Fengyang, Anhui, hence it is commonly known as the Fengyang Flower Drum. Its earliest lyrics described the situation in Fengyang, saying, "Talking about Fengyang, speaking of Fengyang, Fengyang was originally a good place, but since the emergence of Emperor Zhu, ten years of drought and nine years of famine" and so on. The performers all dress as women from Fengyang, with headscarves and blue shirts. One person beats the gong, and another beats the drum, advancing and retreating in rhythm. Even now, it can still be occasionally seen in neighborhood squares. Later, in the northern allegro halls, whenever large drum books were sung, the performers could also dress up and perform. However, one person would dress as a boy, and the rest as girls, with the musicians playing the gong and drum separately. The singers would only rotate, sing, and dance, which was different from the original flower drum. In recent years, it is also common to see women dressed in Fengyang costumes in Shanghai song and dance halls, paired with Western music, singing and dancing in unison, still singing about Fengyang, which still retains the original flavor. As for the flower drum plays performed on stage, there are at least three characters: one playing a beautiful woman, one playing an ugly man, and one playing a luxurious young master. The woman plays the waist drum, the man plays the small gong, and the young master only holds a paper fan. The three characters weave and dance, mainly focusing on teasing and joking, which is quite similar to "Little Shepherd Boy." Although it has the name of flower drum, it is far from the original meaning of Fengyang.

### The Storyteller Skilled in "Three Smiles" (Part 1)

‚Äî Jian Fan

The "Three Smiles" storytelling uses famous scholars of the Ming Dynasty as characters in the book, performing romantic affairs purely as a game of ink. Among them, the four talented scholars of Tang, Zhu, Wen, and Zhou, only Zhou Wen Bin is untraceable, probably the author's self-representation or another hidden allusion, making it even more difficult to investigate. As for the encounter between Tang Bohu and Qiu Xiang, it is ethereal and illusory, and certainly not a reliable history. Although people have repeatedly researched and pieced together based on previous notes, it can only describe the origin and evolution of this storytelling. The ages of Tang Yin, Zhu Zhishan, Wen Zhengming, and Hua Hongshan are far apart, so how could they simultaneously appear to perform this humorous comedy? Novelists use literary flourishes to make it a play, and storytellers use falsehood to tell the truth, speaking plausibly about the open and popular folk stories of traveling to Tiger Hill, the affection of three smiles, and Qiu Xiang's beauty returning to Suzhou, which makes the listeners' ears burn with details that are familiar to several stringed instruments. In the past, the storyteller who was good at "Three Smiles" was Xie Pin Quan, uncle and nephew. Pin Quan's singing voice was gentle and skilled in impersonating both male and female roles, excelling in liveliness and delicacy. Shao Quan's jokes were flawless, especially the role of Zhu Jing Zhao, which was the most popular, hence the reputation of "Living Zhu Zhishan." There was also Wang Shao Quan, who was also known for his skill in telling "Three Smiles" at the time. The scripts of each generation have been modified by literati and are slightly different. Xie Shao Quan's apprentices were numerous, and those who grasped his essence, such as Xia Lian Sheng and Wang Yi Quan, have all passed away. Cui Lian Jun has changed to telling about Empress Dowager Cixi, Pan Lian Ting has already lost her voice, and Yu Lian Qing relies solely on teaching songs to make a living. As the years go by, she is no longer as grateful as she used to be. Lin Xiao Zu, a disciple of Xie Pin Quan, and Wang Geng Xiang, have successively joined the Pu Yu Society. Geng Xiang's art is excellent and closely resembles her teacher. Today's storytellers of "Three Smiles" are all outstanding talents from the Wang and Xie lineages. There are very few of them. Therefore, I will describe what I know separately below.

### Riding the Storm Together

‚Äî He Jia Zhi

(9) Hell on Earth

Poor Cui Zhen was tied up like a wonton, at the mercy of the democratic people. They moved her from the ground to the bed, and from the bed to the ground, tossing her up and down. Someone kept asking, "Do you know how powerful Master Wei is?" The one who asked this wasn't necessarily Wei Shao Yun, but if Wei Shao Yun himself asked, he would also call himself Wei Shao Yun. Cui Zhen bit her teeth on her lower lip, leaving a row of deep teeth marks. She didn't utter a sound. Wei Shao Yun said, "Let her rest, loosen her up." Someone came to untie the rope, saying, "This is Master Wei's grace, you have to be clear about it." Cui Zhen collapsed on the bed, her hands were originally raised, so she left them raised, her feet were originally bent, so she left them bent, tightly closing her eyes, too lazy to move. After about three or five minutes, Wei Shao Yun raised his foot and gently kicked Cui Zhen's small leg hanging under the edge of the bed, saying, "Hey, hey, look at my face. The revenge I gave you is still not worth two-tenths of what you gave me." Cui Zhen opened her eyes and glared at him, pulling her leg back up. Someone said, "No, no, this woman hasn't woken up yet, she still has Wei Shao Yun in her eyes, she doesn't know about the grace that Master Wei gave her." This kind of slander was very effective in front of Wei Shao Yun. Only to hear Wei Shao Yun shout, "Bring up the prepared incense." Those followers obeyed and took a handful of incense sticks from the table, about thirty or forty of them, each about as thick as a regular pencil. They struck a match to light them, burning brightly, but then blew them out, making a handful and handing them to Wei Shao Yun. Wei Shao Yun shook the handful of incense sticks, and a burst of white smoke rose up. Wei Shao Yun shook it and said, "Help her sit up." The people on either side helped Cui Zhen up, holding one hand and one foot each, a total of four people holding Cui Zhen down. Wei Shao Yun placed the incense sticks three or four inches below Cui Zhen's chin, letting the thick smoke rush into Cui Zhen's nostrils. This was bitter for her. She wanted to dodge, but her hands and feet were held down and she couldn't move. At first, she held her breath, but eventually she couldn't hold on any longer and many yellow liquid streamed out of her nose from the smoke. The people on either side said, "Do you know how powerful Master Wei is?" Cui Zhen really suffered, but she answered with one word, "I know." (187)
