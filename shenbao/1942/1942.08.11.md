### Aleutian Islands Vicinity - US Ships Repelled - Details of the Solomon Sea Battle

Tokyo, 10th, DOMEI - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 10th that enemy forces of significant strength appeared in the direction of the Aleutian Islands on August 8th and were repelled by the Imperial Navy. Tokyo, 9th, DOMEI - Regarding the great sea battle near the Solomon Islands, details are now announced as follows: At 11:20 AM on August 7th, a Japanese reconnaissance plane caught sight of an enemy fleet sailing north of the Coral Sea and immediately reported it to the authorities. Soon after, Japanese bombers repeatedly flew to attack the enemy ships, dropping countless heavy bombs. The enemy fleet was dispersed, and several ships, enveloped in black smoke and flames, sank to the bottom of the Coral Sea. The remaining enemy ships scattered and fled eastward. Enemy fighters and bomber-fighters took off from aircraft carriers to intercept the Japanese planes, resulting in a fierce aerial battle. However, the enemy planes were no match for the Japanese planes and were shot down into the sea one by one. In an instant, 32 fighters and 9 bomber-fighters fell into the sea. As night fell, the Japanese fleet suddenly opened fire and attacked. The enemy ships were caught off guard, and the thunderous sound of cannons was incessant. The two fleets then approached and engaged in battle. Japanese torpedo boats also unleashed their power, sinking enemy ships one by one. This was the first night battle of the Solomon Islands. By dawn on the 8th, the coconut palms on the Solomon Islands gradually became visible in the dawn light. At that time, the Japanese naval and air forces were still pursuing the enemy ships relentlessly, determined to ensure that none escaped. Lisbon, 10th, HAI TONG - According to a Washington communiqué, the naval battle in the Solomon Islands is still ongoing, and the losses on both sides are still difficult to estimate. Tokyo, 10th, DOMEI - According to naval experts, the counter-offensive launched by the British and Americans in the Solomon Islands and Kiska Island is merely a guerrilla tactic to appease public sentiment at home. Their fleet attacked the weakest point in the Japanese defenses on the Solomon Islands, but the swift Japanese navy discovered it, causing the British and Americans to lose 17 warships and more than 11 transport ships. Their attack on Kiska Island was purely for propaganda purposes, and their propaganda has been completely refuted by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters.

### Colonel Hirade Broadcasts Battle Situation, Germany Congratulates Japanese Navy Victory

Tokyo, 10th, DOMEI - Naval Spokesman Colonel Hideo Hirade of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters is scheduled to broadcast the detailed battle situation of the Solomon Sea Battle tonight in Tokyo. All Japanese radio stations will rebroadcast it. Tokyo, 10th, HAI TONG - Political figures here commented last night on the naval battle near the Solomon Islands, saying that the British and American fleets clearly wanted to break through the Japanese encirclement of northern Australia, but the superior Japanese navy ultimately defeated them and inflicted a fatal blow. The Allied fleet off the coast of Australia is almost completely wiped out. The air force's contribution to this victory of the Japanese navy is also undeniable. Berlin, 9th, DOMEI - German radio stations broadcast at noon on the 9th a special broadcast of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of the great victory of the Japanese navy in the Solomon Sea Battle and played the Japanese military march to express congratulations. Local evening newspapers in Berlin also carried headlines announcing the Japanese navy's great victory in the Solomon Islands. Authoritative sources here declared that this naval battle has confirmed to the world that control of the Western Pacific is firmly in our hands. After suffering this loss, the strength of the British and American navies has further declined, so the Japanese army can freely carry out landing operations in various places. The future development of the war situation will be even more interesting.

The police tried to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, but the crowd still swarmed and refused to disperse. The police then dispersed the crowd with whips. Gandhi was originally scheduled to give a speech at Chawpatty Park here on the evening of the 9th, so people flocked to the park from the afternoon. After hearing the news of Gandhi's arrest, the crowd was indignant and clashed with the police. Most of the shops in the city have closed their doors and gone on strike. Everywhere, crowds were preventing vehicles from driving and shouting slogans such as "British people should withdraw from India," "Boycott British goods," and "Boycott American goods." The police were running back and forth in the city to suppress the unrest, exhausted. Also, in Nagpur, Pune, Ahmedabad, and Kaira, Congress Party figures were arrested and branches were sealed. The people in each area were extremely indignant and clashed with the police, and the situation was quite serious. Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to a Reuters dispatch from Bombay, clashes occurred between the people and the police in five locations in Bombay. In addition to using tear gas, the police also opened fire, injuring 15 people who were sent to hospitals. According to the British authorities, the people looted two granaries of the Governor's Office, threw stones at the police station, and set fire to public buses.

Circumstances of the Leaders' Arrests

Lisbon, 10th, DOMEI - According to a Bombay dispatch, Mrs. Gandhi has also been arrested and sent to Pune, where Gandhi is confined. Before Mrs. Gandhi was arrested, the police asked her if she had decided to give a speech to the public at Bombay's Shivaji Park. Mrs. Gandhi replied in the affirmative and was arrested. Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to Bombay sources, the circumstances of the arrest of Gandhi and other leaders of the National Congress Party are as follows: At 5:00 AM on the 9th, a British police team drove three cars to Gandhi's residence and surrounded it. They ordered the guards to lead them inside. At that time, Gandhi was already praying. He ordered his secretary, Miraben, Ms. Wright, and other leaders of the National Congress Party to come out and inquire first. After the prayer was over, he calmly surrendered and boarded the car with the police team. On that day, the police authorities completely cut off all telephones and railways from 2:00 AM, conducting the operation secretly so that all parties could not understand the truth of the matter. After Gandhi was arrested, his second secretary, Pyarelal, published the words that Gandhi had instructed him to convey at the time of his arrest. He said, "Gandhi originally intended to meet with the workers today, but this is now impossible. However, he entrusted me to convey to them that our future is only freedom or death. This is a word that we cannot forget." Also, when Mrs. Gandhi was summoned, the police authorities asked her if she would represent Gandhi in giving a speech. Mrs. Gandhi said, "I have this intention." Because of this, she was also arrested and imprisoned. As for the arrest of Speaker Acharya, it was at 4:30 AM. The police team only surrendered after arriving at his bedroom. As of 3:00 AM on the 9th, the entire Executive Committee of the National Congress Party had been arrested. In addition, 149 others, including former Bombay Governor Khare and Ms. Sophie White, head of the Women's Volunteer Corps, were also detained.

Lisbon, 10th, DOMEI - According to Bombay news, riots broke out in Bombay after Gandhi and others were arrested. The police released tear gas and other things to disperse the crowd. As a result, ten people were shot and killed. Most of the factories in Bombay have stopped work. Trams and public buses have also been suspended. The curfew starts at 7:00 PM.

Defense Committee Holds Meeting

Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to New Delhi sources, the Indian Governor-General's Office held a meeting of the Defense Committee this morning. In addition to Governor-General Linlithgow and one British member, all eleven Indian members did not attend, which is enough to show the reaction of the Indian people to the British high-pressure policy.

Muslim League's Attitude Undecided

Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to Bombay sources, Jinnah, Chairman of the All India Muslim League, has notified Muslims to join the National Congress's actions and await the decision of the Muslim League Standing Committee meeting to be held on the 16th of this month to determine their attitude before deciding whether to advance or retreat.

Letter from the Governor of Hong Kong to the Indians

Hong Kong, 9th, DOMEI - Lieutenant General Isogai, Governor of Hong Kong, recently issued a letter to the All India Committee of the Bombay National Congress, stating that if you cannot rescue the Indian people from British rule, it will be a disgrace not only to yourselves but also to all the people of India. Now is a good opportunity to solve the problem, and it will soon pass. All Indians in Asia today share a common goal and will complete the independence movement under a common leader, which is commendable.

### Situation in the European War - Major Developments Imminent - Allied Forces May Land in the Netherlands - The Battle of the Atlantic Can Control the Overall Situation

Zurich, 10th, HAVAS - According to the military reporter of the Swiss Daily, the current situation is unlikely to last, and there will be major developments in Europe. The German army is advancing fiercely towards the Caucasus, and the Soviet Union cannot give up its lifeline. To reverse the situation, the Allied countries must take major action. If the Red Army does not fight a desperate battle south of Moscow, the British and American armies must launch a large-scale landing on the European continent. Merely bombing German industries with British planes is not enough to alleviate the German offensive on the Eastern Front. Stockholm, 10th, HAVAS - According to reports, after receiving repeated reports from reconnaissance planes, the German authorities have now admitted that the danger of enemy troops landing in the Netherlands is becoming increasingly serious. Several people in the Netherlands have been arrested as hostages to see how the Dutch people will react in the event of a British or American landing. Lisbon, 10th, HAVAS - The Manha newspaper commented on the Moscow conference today, saying that the proposal to launch a second front was based on strategy rather than military strategy. Any government that is dominated by strategy and ignores military strategy often cannot regret it. However, the opening of a second front is urgently needed by the Allied countries. It is necessary both in domestic politics and foreign policy. Many people in Britain agree with this move, not to mention the Soviet Union. However, sending 500,000 troops to land on the coast of Western Europe is unlikely to significantly change the war situation or alleviate the German offensive in the East. The real battle is the Battle of the Atlantic. The victory or defeat in that area can control the overall situation. However, like in 1918, the war may not be solved by military means alone.

Police Science Common Sense

### Summer Disease Prevention - Epidemics Often Occur Due to Careless Eating and Drinking - Strengthening the Stomach and Intestines Can Reduce the Chance of Infection

Those annoying flies, flying all over the world, because of their back and forth flying, they ambush human life everywhere. The most important intestinal diseases include dysentery and typhoid fever. Even a moment of carelessness can lead them to take away your life. Therefore, the reason for contracting these diseases is mostly due to careless eating and drinking, bringing these kinds of dysentery bacteria and typhoid bacteria into the intestines, giving them a chance to breed rampantly in the human body. Their symptoms are briefly written below: "Cholera," commonly known as tiger cholera, is the most terrible epidemic, which can end a person's life in a very short period of time! Mild cases are nothing more than vomiting and diarrhea a few times, with a headache or dizziness, mild fatigue, and cold limbs, which can be cured in about a week, while severe cases are often fatal, with severe vomiting and diarrhea, sunken eye sockets, sunken fingertips, pale face, thirst, low and hoarse voice, convulsions, and other symptoms. However, people with weakened bodies are more likely to develop this disease. If you take "Ruosu" to strengthen your body and replenish blood, you will become stronger and more resistant to bacteria, and you will never suffer from this disease.

"Typhoid" usually lasts about four weeks. In the first week, appetite is poor, and there is fatigue and fever. In the second week, the temperature increases to about 39 degrees and 40 degrees Celsius, with impaired consciousness, delirium, and a dry, dark, and thick tongue coating, while the tip of the tongue peels off. This week is the most dangerous. If you don't pay attention in the third week, such as intestinal ulcers, or even bleeding and perforation, the temperature will drop, and you will inevitably die from exhaustion. However, if you pass the third week without this phenomenon, the body temperature will return to normal after the fourth week, and all symptoms will disappear, and you will gradually recover.

"Dysentery" is commonly divided into red and white types, but red dysentery is more severe, and is popularly known as dysentery. Mild cases are similar to colitis, with severe abdominal pain, a sense of urgency and incomplete evacuation when defecating, and mucus in the stool, while severe cases develop ulcers in the intestines, with thick blood in the stool, fatigue, listlessness, and an increased number of defecations, often leading to death.

In general, the above three diseases are caused by a moment of carelessness, resulting in great suffering, and even death. How can you not be careful? Therefore, the ancients said, "Disease enters through the mouth, and trouble comes from the mouth." This is indeed true. However, it is not possible to be so precise and have such confidence in careful eating and drinking. Now, there is a savior. Even more reliable and convenient than getting a vaccination, is the most famous "Ruosu". It is the most reliable and safest preventive medicine. If you don't want to suffer from disease, quickly take the great Ruosu. "Ruosu" contains vitamin B, powerful digestive enzymes, hormones...and therefore has special effects.

### German Advances in the Caucasus - Occupying Two Major Industrial Towns - Advancing Towards the Black Sea Coast in a Fan-Shaped Formation - Battle for Stalingrad Reaches its Peak

Berlin, 10th, HAI TONG - The German High Command announced last night that the oil field center of Maikop, at the northern end of the Caucasus Mountains, was occupied by German mechanized units at 6:20 PM last night (1:20 AM Shanghai Daylight Saving Time).

German Führer's Headquarters, 10th, HAI TONG - The German High Command issued a special war report yesterday afternoon stating that German infantry divisions have already captured Krasnodar, the capital of the Kuban region. Before the Germans occupied this important Soviet military equipment center, there was a fierce battle north of Kuban. The German Air Force covered the ground forces and broke through the enemy's solid positions north of Kuban, which was very effective.

Berlin, 10th, HAI TONG - Pyatigorsk, the city occupied by the German mechanized units, is one of the leading cities in the Caucasus and an important city in the tea-producing area. It has a population of approximately 65,000.

Ukrainian Border, 10th, HAVAS - News that German advance troops have arrived at Igatolino in the Caucasus. Today they may also occupy Georgievsk.

Stockholm, 10th, HAVAS - After the German army occupied Krasnodar and Maikop in southern Soviet Union, they are now only about sixty miles away from the three ports of Anapa, Novorossiysk, and Tuapse on the Black Sea. However, the German army may rest for a while, while suppressing the remnants of the enemy on the coast of Azov, and transferring fresh troops and military supplies to the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains to climb and attack. However, the battle for Stalingrad is reaching its peak. Soviet troops not only resisted fiercely, but also launched counterattacks from time to time.

Lisbon, 9th, DOMEI - According to news arriving here, the German army is attacking Stalingrad fiercely, and a part of it has crossed the Don River east of Tsimlyansk and advanced to the Volga River. Its vanguard tank units have also attacked Kodernikovo, 170 kilometers southwest of Stalingrad, and are continuing to attack Kodernikovo.

Berlin, 10th, HAI TONG - The German High Command issued a special supplementary war report last night stating that the German troops that captured Krasnodar were the infantry divisions that captured Rostov and Bataysk thirteen days ago. These divisions pursued the remnants of the enemy and completed the 280-kilometer journey between the Don and Kuban Rivers in thirteen days, marching along a sloping public road without cover in gray sand and scorching heat, directly to the northern defense line of Krasnodar and the Kuban River, which was protected by huge tank traps. After a fierce battle, they broke through the enemy's defense line and began attacking the city. The German Air Force's light anti-aircraft artillery units made great contributions in these battles.

Berlin, 10th, HAI TONG - The last two major strongholds in the Kuban region, Krasnodar and Maikop, were occupied by the German army yesterday. Although the Soviet Allied forces relied on strong defensive works on the northern bank of the Kuban River to resist the German army, they still failed to prevent the fall of the above two major strongholds. After the German vehicles and friendly forces crossed the Kuban River, they continued to advance towards the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea from the foothills of the Caucasus. Before Krasnodar was surrounded by the German army on three sides and had not yet fallen, the Slovak army had already crossed the Kuban River. The annual oil production of the Maikop oil field is approximately between two million and three million tons. The Soviet war situation north of the Caucasus is now in a desperate situation. The German army and friendly forces are now advancing in a fan-shaped formation along three routes: 1. Advancing from Krasnodar towards Novorossiysk. 2. Advancing from Maikop towards the port of Tuapse on the Black Sea. 3. Advancing from Loshilorovsk towards the upper reaches of the Kuma River. According to non-German sources, the German troops advancing along the Rostov-Baku railway have now reached Pyatigorsk. The rapid advance of the German army has put the Soviet troops along the Sea of Azov in a desperate situation. The war in the northern Caucasus has now been decided, and complete occupation is only a matter of time. The war between the Don and Volga Rivers is now in full swing. It seems that Timoshenko has flown to Stalingrad to personally supervise the battle, but the Soviet army's counterattack west of Stalingrad has not succeeded, and the German army has approached the Volga River in that area.

### Soviet Army Employs Restraining Tactics, Launches Powerful Counteroffensive in the Central Sector

Moscow, 9th (Havas) – According to official announcements, our forces are still fighting in the Kotelnikovo area, while in the Voronezh area, our forces have achieved successive victories and have already crossed the Don River.

Berlin, 9th (Havas) – The High Command announced in its war bulletin today that the cities of Maikop and Krasnodar have been occupied by our forces. Simultaneously, major battles are also taking place in the central sector of the Belyov area. The reason is that the Red Army is attempting to employ restraining tactics in order to save the southern Red Army from the severe threat it is facing. The Red Army launched an offensive after receiving reinforcements, but it was ultimately defeated by our forces and retreated to its original positions.

Stockholm, 9th (Havas) – The Red Army's official newspaper, Red Star, admitted today to the German victories in the Caucasus, stating that the Red Army in the Armavir area could not withstand the enemy's fierce attacks and has been forced to retreat. In the Kropotkin area, the enemy has a large number of armored units, and our forces have been unable to resist and have retreated. In short, the Soviet forces fighting on the front lines are powerless to stop the enemy from advancing.

### Soviet Soldiers Contest Every Inch of Ground, Cossack Troops Display Power

Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Although Soviet leaders are urging Soviet troops to fight to the death, the German and allied forces in the southern sector of Eastern Europe have achieved another major victory, occupying Pyatigorsk at the northern foot of the Caucasus. This city is 120 kilometers southeast of Voroshilovsk. At the same time, German forces between the Volga and Don Rivers have been engaged in fierce battles with counterattacking Soviet forces southwest of Stalingrad, and the enemy is retreating in defeat. Yesterday, German forces within the great bend of the Don River launched an attack west of the Kala area, trapping elite Soviet troops in a heavy encirclement. Moscow Radio reported that the enemy forces are continuing to advance, and the situation on the front lines is becoming increasingly tense. Our forces have a responsibility to defend the territory, and must do everything possible to defend every inch of ground.

Moscow, 10th (Havas) – Today's Pravda reports that the enemy forces on the southern front have again broken through our defenses, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Our front-line soldiers should fight even harder and should meet the enemy forces head-on, rendering them helpless. At present, the Red Army is conducting defensive battles in the Kropotkin and Armavir areas, which are exceptionally fierce. Near a certain city, our Cossack cavalry, with the assistance of the air force, annihilated over a thousand Romanian cavalrymen in a single day, but the German side quickly sent reinforcements to the area and broke through the Red Army's positions to the south.

### Moscow Conference Concludes Yesterday, British and American Representatives Remain in the Soviet Union to Discuss Pending Issues, Soviet Union Expresses Gratification with Turkey's Attitude

Lisbon, 10th (Alliance News Agency) – According to a broadcast from London relaying Vichy radio, the conference in Moscow concluded four days after the arrival of British Ambassador Sir Cripps and American Ambassador Steinhardt. It is said that some British and American representatives will remain in the Kremlin to resolve pending issues. This conference was to discuss the opening of a second front in order to relieve the pressure on the Red Army from the German forces in the Caucasus.

Vichy, 9th (Havas) – The political consequences and impact of the German invasion of the Caucasus and the imprisonment of prominent figures of the Indian National Congress are attracting the attention of international observers here. Regarding the Caucasus matter specifically, it has triggered unprecedented rumors. Whether British Prime Minister Churchill is in Moscow is uncertain, but it is believable that the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union have jointly arrived in Moscow and are holding meetings with Soviet authorities. This matter is of great significance, and it is presumed that the agenda will be either the opening of a second front or the shipment of supplementary military supplies to the Soviet Union, to demonstrate the determination of the Allied nations to provide assistance. However, if Stalin and his associates believe that the long-awaited Allied aid is insufficient to meet their needs, what will happen then? Rumors that the Soviet Union is preparing to make a separate peace with Germany have surfaced more than once, indicating that Soviet authorities are attempting to use these rumors to stimulate the Allied nations to provide more effective assistance. Geographically speaking, Turkey's neutrality is closely related to the successive defeats of the Red Army. At present, there is no reason to doubt Turkey's sincerity in maintaining neutrality. Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu reiterated this intention in a speech to the National Assembly the other day. Turkey controls the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, holding the key to the Black Sea. The war is currently taking place around this area, and the Caucasus war situation, which is increasingly unfavorable to the Red Army, is directly related to Turkey's position. However, the Turkish government has just dispatched Agâh Cafar as the new ambassador to the Soviet Union in order to communicate information and thereby increase mutual friendship. It is unexpected that the Soviet Union would have such a friendly nation in its time of trouble. Regarding the Indian issue, Britain's attitude has suddenly become strong, and it has decided to arrest the leaders of the Congress Party. This move may have a significant impact on the situation in Asia and will further intensify the internal disputes in this largest of British colonies.

Opening a Second Front: British and American Differences

New York, 9th (Havas) – The New York Times published today that although the discussion of opening a second front has been rampant, it has not yet materialized. The reason is that British and American authorities have not yet reached agreement on the method and purpose. According to the original plan, the British side was responsible for manufacturing fighter planes with all its might, while the United States was dedicated to manufacturing bombers. As of now, Britain seems to have changed its policy and intends to manufacture bombers with all its might. According to the British military authorities, what Britain wants are long-range bombers, while American bombers are not suitable for this type of condition. This is the first point. American bombers fly faster and are more threatening, but they carry only half the bombs of British planes. This is the second point. The American side advocates high-altitude bombing, while the British side's theory is the opposite. This is the third point. Until these three differences are resolved, it seems unlikely that any further action will be taken.

German Defenses in Western Europe Are Solid

Madrid, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Spanish reporter Mr. Campo recently visited Western Europe to inspect the German coastal defenses. He has now published a lengthy report in ABC, stating that under the close cooperation of the German army, navy, and air force, it is impossible for the enemy to launch a surprise attack. Although each fortress is an independent structure, there is extremely convenient communication between them via wireless telegraphy, telephone, railway, and highway. Therefore, from Norway to the Bay of Biscay, it is like a long wall. All kinds of fortifications extend deep into the countryside, and the techniques of camouflage are superb. The reporter was often deceived by them.

### British and German Air Forces Exchange Bombardments

Berlin, 9th (Havas) – According to news issued from here, yesterday a squadron of German aircraft heavily bombed British factories for quite some time, ending only at midnight. Important military targets in Leeds and Sheffield were bombed, and several fires were seen.

Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – According to responsible sources here, four British aircraft were shot down last night while dropping bombs and incendiary devices on western Germany. German aircraft also attacked a city on the southern coast of England and military targets on the east coast last night.

### Former Hungarian Prime Minister Fights on the Eastern Front

Stockholm, 10th (Havas) – According to a special dispatch from Budapest in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, former Hungarian Prime Minister Imrédy and former Hungarian Renewal Party Chairman Jaross are fighting in the Soviet front-line army.

### Nomura Returns Home to Discuss His Feelings on the Japan-US Negotiations: Ashamed of His Mission, Unable to Avert the Crisis; Ishii and Others Discuss the Recent Situation in American Countries

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to a special dispatch from Shonan Port (i.e., Singapore) on the "Asama Maru" on the 9th, when the exchange ship "Asama Maru" was about to arrive at Shonan Port, the Asahi Shimbun reporter traveling with it interviewed Ambassador Nomura, who expressed his feelings, saying that he had been extremely depressed during his past detention. Today, he has been restored to freedom from an unfree situation, for which he is deeply grateful. To this day, the reason why the Japanese navy and its air force have been able to achieve great victories in the various naval battles in the Pacific is, in my opinion, due to years of training. I have heard that the United States has had a large part of its main battleships and aircraft carriers destroyed in the Pacific, so at present, the United States has no possibility of launching an offensive against Japan in the Pacific. When I received the mission to be the ambassador to the United States, I deeply felt the importance of the mission, but I have not achieved any success. When I took office, Ambassador Kumaichi Hōnda encouraged me to return with honor, and I have not forgotten this matter to this day. I once made it clear that maintaining peace in the Pacific and preventing the expansion of the European war between Japan and the United States is truly for the happiness of mankind. However, now my important mission has ended in failure, so I can truly be called a defeated general. Although the term "defeated general" is used in the military, I will inevitably be labeled as a defeated general due to the failure of the Japan-US negotiations. I don't know how many times I had talks with Roosevelt and Hull when I was in the United States. From February 14th of last year, when I went to the White House to present my credentials, until December 7th, when Ambassador Kurusu and I went to the State Department to hand Hull Japan's reply, it lasted eight months. Today, recalling the past course of Japan-US negotiations, I truly have endless feelings. The Ambassador still avoided explaining various issues related to the future of the United States.

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to a special dispatch from Shonan Port on the "Asama Maru" on the 9th, Ambassador Kurusu recently expressed his feelings about the Japan-US negotiations to the Asahi Shimbun reporter traveling with him, saying that he still remembers being summoned to Foreign Minister Togo's official residence in early November of last year. There, he saw Togo with a solemn face, instructing him to go to Washington to assist Ambassador Nomura, and expressing that Japan, at this last moment, was determined to exert all its strength to negotiate with the United States through diplomatic means and could not delay any longer. Before departing on the afternoon of the 4th, he also paid a visit to the Prime Minister. As a result, Secretary Yuuki and he flew to Hong Kong together and went to the United States via Manila. When Hull handed us the Japanese aide-mémoire on November 26th of last year, his face seemed unpleasant, because the US government is unusually complex, and diplomatic matters are not decided by Hull alone. Regarding the formation of the ABC line, the United States cannot decide arbitrarily as the Chongqing government and the Dutch government-in-exile can. When I first arrived in the United States, Ambassador Nomura was invigorating his spirits and constantly negotiating with Roosevelt and Hull to avert the crisis in the Pacific. However, as the situation changed, the flames of war were already imminent. At this point, Ambassador Kurusu's topic turned to the British side. According to what he said about the British attitude at that time, when the Japanese army advanced into southern Vietnam and the United States froze Japanese funds, the British attitude underwent a major change. The British view was that if Japan and the United States went to war, it would benefit Britain. Therefore, they first sent troops to reinforce Hong Kong and Singapore, adopting an encirclement posture to stimulate Japan. In the second half of the Japan-US negotiations, the British attitude changed, as the British believed that hundreds of thousands of troops could at least hold Singapore and stop the Japanese army from advancing.

Shonan City, 9th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Brazil Ishii, who recently arrived here aboard the "Conte Verde", discussed the recent situation in Brazil as follows. Before the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor, Brazil generally adopted a bystander attitude, but after the Rio de Janeiro conference decided to declare war, the people held ill will towards Japan. Initially, quite strict rules were applied to Japanese residents, and recently travel has become extremely difficult and unfree. Regarding news of Japanese victories, although the News Control Bureau directly under the President made malicious propaganda, it was unable to conceal the facts, and the truth was eventually published.

Shonan City, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Ambassadors Sakamoto to Peru, Akiyama to Panama, and Yanagiuchi to Colombia, who arrived here on the 9th on the exchange ship "Conte Verde," issued statements as follows. Ambassador Sakamoto said that Peru is in the same position as other South American countries, only following the orders of the United States. The general public has never held ill will towards Japan. For example, the rumor of a Japanese volunteer army was probably instigated by the United States, but after I clarified it, this rumor immediately disappeared. Ambassador Akiyama said that only women and a portion of men have returned this time. Most of the men are still residing there, waiting for the second exchange ship, which is truly regrettable. Ambassador Yanagiuchi said that the oppression of Japanese residents in Colombia is relatively light, and there are very few Japanese residents living there. There is nothing else to say. I am deeply gratified to be able to see the appearance of my motherland.

Civilian Exchange Ship "Kura Maru" Departs Japan

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency)

The second exchange ship "Kamakura Maru" for British and Japanese diplomats and civilians departed Yokohama port at 11:20 a.m. on the 10th. The ship's hull has been repainted dark gray and marked with a white cross on the side. The ship will first go to Shanghai to pick up about 900 British diplomats and civilians residing in China, and then sail to Lourenço Marques.

### Air Battle Occurs on the Egyptian Front

Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced last night that German light fighters went to the area north of El Alamein early in the morning to bomb enemy artillery positions and convoys, and attacked British troops en route to Alexandria. In the air battle, two enemy aircraft were shot down.

### Truth Comes to Light in the Case of the Abduction of White Russian Officers: Soviet Secret Police Leader Arrested in Paris

Paris, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports here, the truth about the disappearance of Tsarist Russian Generals Koutepoff and Miller in Paris twelve and five years ago has come to light due to the arrest of Tretiakov, the former leader of the Soviet secret police in Paris. During World War I, Tsarist Russian General Koutepoff was abducted in broad daylight in Paris on January 27, 1930, and then disappeared without a trace. His successor, General Miller, suffered the same fate in Paris on September 24, 1937. Because General Miller had met with General Skoblin before his disappearance, the French police suspected Skoblin of being involved in the case, so he was sentenced to lifelong exile. His wife was sentenced to twenty years in prison for being suspected of conspiracy. According to Le Petit Parisien, the mastermind of the case, Tretiakov, has been arrested by the German military police. When the German army occupied Minsk, they discovered documents related to Tretiakov's crimes and arrested him. When Tretiakov was active in Paris, he had a residence and a location. The residence and the office of the Tsarist Russian veterans were located in the same building. According to investigations, the office of the Tsarist Russian veterans was equipped with microphones connected to Tretiakov's residence. Tretiakov has also admitted that he was the mastermind behind the abduction of the White Russian generals. When the German army entered Paris, Tretiakov remained in Paris and is still being held in Paris.

### Sketches of the Nile (Continued)

Daraw is north of Elephantine Island and is a market for buying and selling camels. The places where camels grow must be lands with a large number of beasts. Egypt in prehistoric times had continuous rainfall, lush trees, and among the abundant grasses were many bulls, lions, wild dogs, bears, and elephants. As for the Nile River, only hippos were seen wallowing, and fish chased fish and crabs. Now, dried corpses of catfish can still be seen in nearby temples, the so-called mummies. Recently, a catfish was accidentally caught in Luxor, killed, and made into a mummy, which has become a novel piece of news. Because since the religious authorities expressed that they would no longer protect this ugly aquatic creature, catfish have almost disappeared.

Traveling north from here, you reach a small town called Idfu, famous for its magnificent Temple of Horus, with extremely rich carvings on the walls, all of which are portraits of Egyptian emperors. Unfortunately, early Christians who came here, out of excessive enthusiasm for promoting their religion, completely destroyed the carvings on the walls.

At this time, there are pleasing scenes on the Nile River. Imagine yourself boating on the river at the first light of dawn, the white spirit islands in the distant forests echoing with warbling songs. There are many birds flying and singing on the palm trees in the wheat fields on both banks, becoming the best music in nature. Cargo ships come and go slowly on the river, and the boatmen pole along while singing folk songs, looking very contented. On the shore, there is the sound of hooves, and a donkey rushes past, suddenly emitting a harsh bray, like a saw sawing through tough wood, a strange sound. As the sun rises, the largest organ on the Nile River begins to play music. Never has the world heard such music, which sounds like a band playing together from afar. In fact, it is the sound of water being drawn from the Nile to the fields using a shaduf. Every time the farmer scoops a bucket of water into the field, the shaduf rotates once, making a gurgling sound. Although this is a sound of friction, it sounds very pleasant and has a musical beauty. This music, which can be heard every day, has lasted for a long time and has been passed down from ancient times to the present.

Traveling on and on like this, boating north on the Nile River, you reach Luxor, which was mentioned earlier. Starting from Aswan, all you see along the way are rural fields and bamboo and mud houses. Only in Luxor can you see the tall and magnificent royal palaces and temples, modern hotels, and luxurious emperors. Nearby is the great city of Thebes, which can be called the largest cemetery in the world. The emperors, queens, and nobles of all dynasties buried here are too numerous to count. The walls are painted with ancient methods of farming, roasting meat, tanning hides, baking bread, building houses, and building ships, all of which are the same as they are today. There is the largest stone statue in Egypt, Ramses II. The statue weighs a total of one thousand tons. The ears are three and a half feet long, and the feet are four feet wide, which shows how large the statue is.

Except when the summer floods come and turn it brown, the Nile River is always a lovely green color. The sky is a deep blue, the most precious color in Egypt. White sails dot the river, and the light of crow feathers sparkles in the sky. The birds flying on the Nile River are mainly hoopoes (birds with beautiful crests that are unique to southern Africa), kingfishers, larks, green bee-eaters, kites, egrets, pelicans, and so on. In the bright blue sky, on the green fertile soil, and in the golden sandy lands, these many tropical birds circle and fly, coming and going alone, unaware that the flames of war have approached the banks of the Nile and that even their nests are in danger of being destroyed.

There are also the peaks of the Nile River. Perhaps you thought that Egypt, apart from the desert areas, is all plains, but in fact, it is not. There are mountain ranges on both banks of the river, with steep cliffs that sometimes rise on the right bank of the river and sometimes on the left bank, presenting different colors as morning and evening pass. At noon, it is milky white, in the afternoon it is golden, later it turns scarlet, and at sunset it becomes vermilion. At twilight, it turns lavender, and under countless sparkling stars, it becomes purple-black.

In the lonely town of Dandara, there is the Temple of Hathor, known as the Egyptian Venus. It is said that the temple has been around for two thousand years, making it a relatively modern antiquity. The walls are painted with the story of Roman emperors sacrificing to the Egyptian gods. In the villages north of here, there are temple murals, some of which are colored and as vivid as yesterday, but when the era is examined, it is always before three thousand years ago. Whether modern colored paintings can last for so many years and remain intact is a question.

Driving towards Cairo from here, the scenery of the Nile River is still extremely beautiful. One bank has rolling mountains, and the other has fields and villages. However, the villages and cities seen are larger than before, and new factories are gradually appearing. In contrast to this modern equipment is the Meidum Pyramid, which is an even older building than the Great Pyramid of Giza. This place often has to blow the "Khamsin wind." The so-called "Khamsin wind" is the hot southeast wind that blows in Egypt for fifty days starting in mid-March. When the wind rises, sand and stones fly, and people and animals run in distress, causing great harm. The strong sandstorm transmitted by the North African telegraph a few days ago, which made it difficult for both sides to fight, was the devastation of this Khamsin wind. Under the sanctions of nature, even fierce and merciless artillery fire has to remain silent for a while, which also shows how small and insignificant humans are compared to the universe.

In a piece of land that is not very large, there has been five thousand years of rich life and culture, all thanks to that great river, which nurtured a great race. The Nile River turns dry soil wet, using its pair of wet hands to create the intelligent Egyptians. The Nile River is forever flowing mightily, and the culture of five thousand years will continue to flourish in the thousands of years to come. (The End)

### Infected Housing - Reduced Scope of Lockdown - Limited to Residences of Patient's Family, Complete Lockdown for Public Venues - National Bank Employee Dies of Plague, Remittances Temporarily Suspended

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that, in order to prevent the spread of cholera, the authorities of the International Settlement had previously announced three measures on the 5th of this month regarding the lockdown of infected houses for five days. Details can be found in the newspapers of the 6th of this month. Now, Dr. Tashiro, the newly appointed Director of the Public Health Department, in order to minimize inconvenience to the residents concerned, has drafted three measures which have been approved and implemented by the Chairman of the Council:

Scope of Lockdown

The scope of the lockdown of infected housing shall be minimized as much as possible in order to reduce the inconvenience to residents in the locked-down housing. If the house where cholera occurs is an apartment, the scope of the lockdown shall be limited to the house where the patient's family lives. If the house where cholera occurs is a hotel, boarding house or other similar place where the owner provides food, the entire building shall be locked down.

Cholera Hospitals

The announcement also stated that private hospitals within the International Settlement are not allowed to admit cholera patients. The citizens within the Settlement who contract cholera should be sent to any of the following isolation hospitals for treatment: Chinese Isolation Hospital, 162 North Hai Road; Chinese Isolation Hospital, 1461 New Gate Road; Chinese Isolation Hospital, 9 Singapore Road; Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, 25 Yu Qiaqing Road; Zhenxin Cholera Hospital, 252 Tianjin Road; Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, 730 Wenjianshi Road.

It should be noted that the two Chinese Isolation Hospitals on North Hai Road and New Gate Road are now full and will not accept any more patients until further notice. The Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital has recently been added to the "Cholera Hospital" list. The Cholera Hospital at 9 Singapore Road (the original site of the Chinese Girls' Middle School) opened on the 8th of this month. All the facilities meet the requirements of the Council and are quite suitable for a hospital. The hospital admitted a total of 52 patients in the past 24 hours.

Areas Affected by the Epidemic

There have been no new developments regarding the lockdown area of Kangti Road. There are approximately 25,000 Chinese residents in the area, mostly from the impoverished class. Currently, except for work and buying groceries, they are not allowed to enter or exit. Of the six cholera cases found in the area, three have already died. The Guofu Bank on Beijing Road has been locked down by the authorities due to the death of an employee named Shen from the epidemic in Zhenxin Hospital, and no one is allowed to enter or exit, so the bank's receipts and payments have been temporarily suspended for several days. It is reported that the epidemic prevention patrol team is very strict in checking epidemic prevention certificates. If they find citizens without certificates or with expired certificates of three months, they will all be detained and taken to nearby injection sites for compulsory injection. Yesterday, epidemic prevention certificates were strictly checked in the Nanjing Road area. Those without certificates were given compulsory injections. Therefore, citizens who have not yet received the second epidemic prevention injection should receive the injection as soon as possible.

Emergency Evacuation of Coffins from Eastern Zhejiang

Since the Coffin Transportation Department of the Guohua Funeral Parlor was ordered to handle the evacuation of coffins stored in Shanghai, the results have been remarkable and have been met with deep satisfaction from all parties. The registration of the poor is especially appreciated by the public. However, due to the arduous nature of the work, it was originally planned to start with Ningbo. Now, due to the rampant epidemic, the evacuation of corpses has become a necessary measure to eliminate the epidemic. Therefore, the department has issued an urgent announcement that all coffins from Eastern Zhejiang, including Shaoxing, Yuyao, Baiguan, Cixi, Zhenhai, Fenghua, Xiangshan, Dinghai, and Ningbo, are urgently being evacuated. If the coffin owners are poor, they can still apply for free or reduced-cost transportation. The coffins of those without family members in funeral parlors, coffin storage facilities, guild halls, and public offices should be compiled into a list within one month and evacuated by the department. Regarding the recent proposal in various newspapers for mass cremation to eradicate the epidemic, it is said that the department is designing it meticulously. The fourteenth evacuation on the 12th of this month has been decided to be carried out in large batches by the Xinning Shao steamboat.

### If You Encounter Difficulties When Obtaining Identity Cards, etc., You Are Allowed to Report It - Necessary Measures to Rectify the Ba甲 System

The General Office of the Mailan Ba甲 District in the French Concession issued a notice yesterday stating, "Regarding the matter of issuing a notice, it has recently been heard that some residents in this district are deliberately made difficult by the 保甲 and household heads (sub-landlords) when obtaining identity cards, rice purchase certificates, movement permits, and other matters. This is not right. In order to rectify the system, the head of this district allows all residents to write a letter with the detailed situation and bring it in person to this office at 25 Zhubao San Road for investigation. Furthermore, if any residents have any questions about the regulations for compiling the Ba甲, they can also ask this office. This notice, as for the rumors that those handling the Ba甲 are forcibly selling 派司套 and extorting donations, the relevant authorities are investigating."

### Early Autumn, the East Wind Blows Tightly - The Weather May Turn Cool and Refreshing - Yesterday's Highest Temperature was 95.7 Degrees, Cold Drinks are No Longer Suitable, Exercise Caution in Daily Life

Yesterday's highest temperature, according to the observatory's record, was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit, which was lower than the previous day's 98.6 degrees. The east wind blew slowly all day long, and there were陣 clouds at noon. Although the sunlight did not retreat, there were slight sparse raindrops around 4:00 pm, which stopped soon after. There were slight raindrops again at 6:00 pm in the evening. Due to the blowing of the east wind, the陣 clouds appeared and disappeared from time to time. If the wind direction does not change, the weather may change and become cooler. According to the seasonal sequence, it is already early autumn, and cold drinks are no longer suitable, so one should be extremely cautious in daily life and diet to avoid being invaded by the epidemic.

### Only Two Theft Cases in the French Concession Last Month - One Murder and One Kidnapping Case Were Solved - The Number of Bicycle Theft Cases Has Been Decreasing Monthly

There were only two theft cases in the French Concession in July, compared to six in June and twelve in the same month last year. One case occurred on July 6th, when two thieves, one of whom was armed with a gun, stole property worth approximately 2,000 yuan from a residence on Tianzhutang Street. The other case occurred on July 20th, when six thieves, two of whom were armed with handguns, entered the home of a blind fortune teller on Xiafei Road, tied up the four members of his family with ropes, and stole clothing worth approximately several hundred yuan and 300 yuan in banknotes. However, in less than three days, the six bandits and their firearms and stolen goods were seized. In addition, on July 24th, three people were arrested in a hotel on Aiduya Road, and two people were arrested in the International Settlement. Under interrogation, they confessed to having committed a robbery on Lafayette Road on September 20th of last year. A handgun and four bullets were found in the home of a bandit arrested on Ximou Road. This case is now being heard in court.

Murder Case

There was only one case. A salt vendor on Xujiahui Road was injured in the abdomen during an argument with a coolie on July 29th and died shortly after. The murderer in this case has been identified and is under active investigation.

Kidnapping for Ransom Case

There was also only one case. This case occurred on Xiangyue 6th, involving an infant from a household on Taisidelang Road who was taken away by her 阿妈. The case was solved five days later, and a suspect was first apprehended, and then the victim was rescued in the South City, and three accomplices were arrested.

Special Theft Case

There were a total of 91 cases (98 cases in June, 137 cases in May), including 41 cases of damage and theft, 30 cases of trespassing, and 283 cases of simple theft (374 cases in June), of which 90 cases have been solved. 111 thieves were apprehended. The number of bicycle theft cases continued to decrease. Of the 89 stolen bicycles (96 in June, 105 in May), 12 have been recovered and 10 thieves have been arrested.

### Rumors of the Withdrawal of Polish Refugees are Groundless - Japanese Nationals Traveling from America Have Arrived in Singapore from East Africa

A senior official of the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai announced yesterday that among the evacuees who took the *Cangmaru* to the Philippines on the 16th of this month, a total of 80 people were not British nationals, of which about half, or about 40 people, were of Polish nationality. They are all law-abiding residents of this port. The rumor that they are Polish refugees is unfounded. It is learned that the *Cangmaru* is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Yokohama on the 14th and evacuate more than 900 Allied officials and civilians on the 16th, of which 60% are officials and the rest are overseas Chinese. Most of them were originally stationed in Shanghai. At that time, diplomatic and consular officials and news reporters stationed in Shanghai will all depart. Mr. Philippe, the former Director-General and President of the Municipal Council, and more than a dozen British police officers who were dismissed from the Police Department are also on the evacuation list.

Japanese Nationals Traveling from America Arrive in Singapore

The English-language *Great American Evening Post* reported that, according to a Singaporean Allied Press dispatch on August 9th, 1,500 Japanese nationals from northern, central, and southern America have been evacuated on the Asama Maru and Contessa Verde from Lourenço Marques. It is learned that they arrived in Singapore at 1:00 pm on the 9th. The Asama Maru moored at 5:00 pm, while the Contessa Verde moored one hour later. These two evacuation ships will stay in Singapore for two days to be entertained by local officials and residents. It is estimated that these two ships will arrive in Yokohama, Japan around August 20th.

### The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are Preparing to Resume Business - The Addresses Have Been Selected

The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are scheduled to announce the resumption of business in early September. The original address of the Bank of China's headquarters at the corner of Hankou Road and Sichuan Road has begun to be repaired for use as the headquarters. The original address of the Bank of Communications' headquarters on the Bund of Hankou Road is being used by the savings department of the Central Reserve Bank, so the Bank of Communications' headquarters has decided to be located at the former address of the Shanghai branch at the corner of Jing'an Temple Road and Muer Ming Road.

Terrorist Drill on Zhejiang Road Yesterday

A terrorist drill was held near Xiangfen Lane on Zhejiang Road in the International Settlement at around 7:10 pm yesterday. It was conducted as if a timed bomb had been discovered. Detectives and police officers blocked traffic and searched door-to-door. As a result, the person who placed the bomb was arrested.

### Central Bank Deposits - Deadline for Withdrawal - Overdue is Considered Abandoned

Since the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank has been under liquidation, all fixed and current deposits have been paid to the third installment, and it has been stipulated that each depositor can withdraw the remaining balance in one lump sum. However, some depositors have delayed in withdrawing the remaining funds. It is heard that the bank will send letters to each depositor, setting a deadline for withdrawing the funds, and overdue withdrawals will be considered as voluntary abandonment.

### Large Sum of Money Found on Tram - The Owner Can Claim It at the Old Gate Police Station

At around 10:00 am on the 8th of this month, a thief was arrested by detectives from the Old Gate Police Station on a Route 14 trolleybus passing Beijing Road. The ticket inspector No. 234 on the bus discovered a paper package containing 1,300 yuan in cash. At that time, the thief confessed that the money was stolen from a passenger named Jia. He was taken to the police station for questioning. However, the owner of the money could not be found for a while, so it is hoped that the owner will quickly claim it at the police station.

### Xin Ning Shao Steamboat to Resume Service Tomorrow - Replacing Chang Shan Maru on Shanghai Route

The resumption of service of the Xin Ning Shao steamboat has been rumored for a long time. After the ship was released from Zhoushan and returned to Shanghai, it was immediately repaired. The work has been completed early, and it has been moored at the No. 1 and No. 2 pontoons of the Jinliyuan Wharf on Xinkai River for a long time. The resumption of service procedures have not been completed, so it has been delayed in sailing. It is learned that all the procedures have now been completed, and it is scheduled to resume service tomorrow (the 12th), sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, managed by the Dongya Shipping Company. The company will transfer the Changshan Maru from the Shanghai-Ningbo route and suspend its service. The Xin Ning Shao steamboat will take over the Changshan Maru, sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo. Also, the Haitong steamboat, which operates on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, needs annual repairs. After returning to Shanghai the day before yesterday, it announced the suspension of service pending repairs.

### Consumption of Flour and Bread Should be Conserved - Twelve Measures for the Use of Bread Cards are Specified

The Information Office of the Municipal Council announced that, in order to prevent the misuse of flour allocated for baking bread, the following twelve regulations have been drawn up and should be strictly followed by all relevant parties:

Bread Cards Should be Carefully Guarded

"Bread Supply Cards" are important documents and should be carefully kept by the holder, just like other identification documents. Bread cards are not allowed to be kept in bakeries or their distribution stores. Bakeries and their distribution stores do not need to send bread cards to their registered customers; each registered customer should pick them up in person. The stubs of bread cards collected by bread retail stores should be sent to the following offices: "(A) Bread Distribution Office, Room 160B, 209 Jiangxi Road, Municipal Council Building, or (B) Food and Price Control Office of the French Concession Authorities, 2 Fuli Li Road, French Concession."

Violation of Rules Will Result in License Revocation

Bakeries and their distribution stores that sell bread without collecting the corresponding number of bread card stubs will be in violation of these rules and will be subject to license revocation. If a bread card holder entrusts their servant to collect bread, the holder will be fully responsible for any errors or deliberate violations of these rules by the servant. If the number indicated on the stubs submitted by a bread card holder exceeds the amount of bread they should receive, their right to participate in any current or future bread distribution program will be cancelled.

The Respective Stores Should be Held Responsible

Bakeries are responsible for all actions of their distribution stores. Bakeries and their distribution stores should collect the same number of bread card stubs as the amount of bread sold at the same time. Bakeries should keep a record of the amount of bread baked each day, noting the number of breads of each fixed weight, such as white bread, brown bread, or rye bread. If the bakeries do not comply with this, the Council may refuse to supply flour. The authorities will only allocate flour according to the amount of flour used to manufacture the various types of bread mentioned above.

Flour Reserves Should be Maintained for a Long Time

The amount of flour allocated according to the current method has not decreased compared to the amount of flour used for baking bread in the past. Consumers should try to reduce bread consumption as much as possible and use bread certificates, so that this satisfactory flour distribution method can continue to be maintained and the bread distribution plan will not be hindered. In order to maintain flour reserves for a long time, the authorities hope that citizens will report immediately if they find bakeries and confectioneries using all or part of the flour to make cakes and other items. If any violations of the bread distribution plan are encountered, please report them truthfully for investigation.

### List of Approved Scholarship Recipients for Elementary and Secondary Schools of the Shenbao Scholarship Fund to be Disclosed Today - Please Pay Special Attention to the Candidates

Since the third session of the Shenbao Reader Scholarship Fund began on June 21st, it has been nearly two months. Thanks to the enthusiastic support from all walks of life, a large amount of money has been donated, and the fund has become increasingly abundant, which is a great honor for the impoverished students. We are deeply grateful to all those who participated in the scholarship work. The number of students applying for this session is even more enthusiastic than the previous two sessions. After initial investigation, detailed review, and screening exams, the two groups of elementary and secondary schools have been completed. Starting today, the list will be published and no further notice will be given.

Scholarship Donations Received Yesterday

Yesterday's scholarship donations were graciously contributed by the Shanghai Trust Company, contributing 2,000 yuan. Considering the difficult times, the colleagues of the company and their friends launched a campaign to save money from spring banquets and donate it to charitable causes. This campaign has ended. The donated funds have been allocated to various charitable organizations, and 2,000 yuan has been allocated to the Shenbao Scholarship Fund. We would like to extend our thanks to Mr. Chu. The remaining donations include 75 yuan from Cai Xiaomei, 20 yuan from Zhou Yongkang, and 10 yuan recorded in error. The total amount is 2,105 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. The previous balance was 168,257.82 yuan, bringing the total to 170,362.82 yuan.

### List of Approved Scholarship Recipients for the Shenbao Reader Scholarship Fund

Elementary School Group

Instructions for Receiving Funds: Starting on the 17th of this month, scholarship checks will be issued. Those who have been approved for the scholarship should come to the office in person or accompanied by a parent within one week from the 17th, bringing their personal seal (the original seal affixed on the application form) to collect the check as soon as possible. Those who fail to do so after the deadline will not be able to receive it. For students whose names have already been published on the list, if they need to change schools, please send a letter to the office immediately, stating the reasons for the change and requesting the change. Otherwise, once the check has been issued, no further changes can be made. After the check is received, the school should be responsible for collecting it from the bank within two weeks. It will be void if overdue. If there is a special reason for the need to reissue and with the consent of this newspaper, the original check should be returned before it can be processed. If the applicant is unable to attend school due to other reasons, the check should be returned as soon as possible. The original documents can be returned with the registration certificate.

### Organizing a Maritime Ba甲

Shanghai has always been an important port for trade. The Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek are usually filled with sails and ships. Therefore, the authorities, in view of this, are actively organizing a maritime Ba甲 by the Maritime Military Police of the Port Affairs Department to consolidate maritime security. A meeting of relevant parties has already been convened to discuss the implementation measures. It is expected to be officially implemented in a short period of time.

### French Authorities Urge Citizens to Hand Over Books - Otherwise They Will Be Destroyed

The Central District and other joint 保甲 chiefs and sub-district 保甲 chiefs of the French Concession received a notice from the 法界 Ba甲 Office of the Central Police Station, stating that all district 保甲 chiefs should notify the household heads under their jurisdiction as soon as possible that citizens should automatically destroy all anti-Japanese books and books and texts that violate the Nanjing government, or hand them over to the respective district 保甲 chiefs for forwarding to the Military Police Department by August 15th. Otherwise, if they are found after the deadline, the residents of the household will be handed over to the Japanese for investigation. So-called anti-Japanese books include all textbooks, old newspapers, and cartoons, satirical propaganda texts, and pamphlets. All residents in the French Concession should comply.

### Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Thanks the Nazi Party in Shanghai for Their Condolences

According to a report from the Allied Press, last year, Mr. Braden, the representative of the German Red Cross, on behalf of the German Nazi Party in Shanghai, donated 20,000 yuan to the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy stationed in China, which was forwarded by the Liaison Department of the Expeditionary Force in China as convalescence funds for Japanese Army and Navy soldiers. This time, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo sent a special letter expressing his gratitude. On the 8th, Lieutenant Colonel Detaira, the director of the Liaison Department, personally handed the letter to Mr. AR Bulesan, the head of the German Nazi Party in Shanghai. The Japanese Prime Minister's letter of thanks is as follows: Dear Sir, During this Great East Asia War, we are grateful for your association's consolation money to our troops on the front lines. Please accept our sincere gratitude. To Mr. Braden, Representative of the German Red Cross in Shanghai, Army Minister Tojo Hideki.

### Non-Essential Streets in the French Concession Temporarily Closed Yesterday Morning

The French Concession authorities, fearing that troublemakers would mingle and cause trouble in the eventful month of August, affecting public safety, ordered all police stations under the Police Department to intensify security work starting yesterday morning, closing non-essential streets in the Aiduya Road area bordering the British and French concessions, and dispatching Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives to patrol closely to maintain public order.

### The Fellow-Villagers Association Stipulates Collective Wedding Fees - Formal Wear 46 Yuan per Couple, Participation Fee 40 Yuan per Session

The Collective Wedding Affairs Committee of the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai discussed various issues in the conference room at 4:00 pm yesterday.

### A Handgun Was Found in a Sun Deck Plank - Stolen Goods Confiscated, Fine of 30 Yuan

Li Xuedou (32 years old), a woman from Huzhou who previously worked as a dancer, has recently been living in difficult circumstances due to the death of her husband. She also has an opium addiction, making it even more difficult to make ends meet. She lives with a former patron named Dong Xiaogouzi at No. 23, Lane 145, Guling Road. Dong is a sub-landlord and is currently working for the Wukang Police Bureau in Hangzhou. Detective Feng Baishun and Detective Shi Huan亭 from the Huishi Police Station learned that his home contained firearms. On the 25th of last month, they secretly went to the address and found a Lotus-style handgun in a sun deck plank, without bullets. Li, the dancer, was also arrested and taken into custody. After questioning yesterday morning, she was fined 20 yuan. If she chooses to do forced labor, it will be calculated at 1 yuan per day. The handgun was confiscated.

### Charitable Round Gateball Tournament Today's Quarterfinals: United Friends vs. South China Again, Nanyang vs. Central United, Bell Sounds Debut Against Patriotism

The Changyin Cup charitable round gateball tournament will begin its second act of the quarterfinals today at 5:15 PM at the Xianxia Middle School field on Moore Road. Tickets are priced at two yuan, and all proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be used for scholarships. The entire tournament consists of three acts. The first game will be a battle for the women's group, with Patriotism facing Bell Sounds. The former is known for its strength among schools, with fierce and capable players like Virginia Wang Yinlan. In their previous match against United Friends, they drew one-on-one, demonstrating their strength. The latter, Bell Sounds, is a rising force with strong combat power. The outcome of this game is crucial for their championship prospects, and both sides will undoubtedly give their all. Following that, South China will rematch United Friends. The two teams fought fiercely in the preliminary round the day before, remaining tied at four-on-four even after five minutes of overtime, with no clear winner. South China is a rising star, known for its teamwork, especially the bravery of the Liu brothers. The return of the iron gatekeeper Dong Jincai further strengthens their team. United Friends boasts excellent skills and numerous talented players like Lu Gusui, Lu Dazhen Zhang Xianlun, and Shen Ji'en, with Qin Bigao continuing to be the goalkeeper. Therefore, today's match is essentially a do-or-die battle, and the outcome is difficult to predict. The final game will be between Nanyang and Central United. Nanyang is the iron army of round gateball, with no shortage of skilled players. Goalkeeper Zhang Banglun guards the fortress like an impregnable wall. Zhang Youzhang and Han Longhai are both dangerous players. While Central United's strength may not match Nanyang's, their fighting spirit is still strong, with capable players like Liu, Shu Shi, Ren Yawei, Mei Xi, and Yue Feng. A thrilling match is expected. The schedule for today is as follows: Patriotism vs. Bell Sounds (Women's Group) 5:15 PM, South China vs. United Friends (Rematch) 6:00 PM, Nanyang vs. Central United (Quarterfinals) 6:30 PM.

### Dong Textiles Continue to Rise, Factory Cloth Prices Surge, Peach Blossom Lady's Cloth Trading is Most Active

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market saw a surge in Dong textiles, prompting retail investors to switch from selling to buying, leading to a continued rise in prices across all types of cloth. However, Peach Blossom Lady's Cloth remained the most actively traded. Very few actual sales transactions occurred. Transactions among peers were driven primarily by speculative intentions. The quoted prices for coarse and fine cloths were as follows: 16-pound Earth coarse cloth, 171 yuan; Flying Hong, 168 yuan; 9-pound New Character, 110 yuan; 8-pound Zhenzhong, 107 yuan; 12-pound Earth fine cloth, 165 yuan; Big Roc, 150 yuan; Wealthy, 152 yuan; Wealthy fine twill, 130 yuan. Colored cloths saw the most significant price increase in Peach Blossom Lady's Cloth, rising by about eight yuan per bolt, opening at 247 to 248 yuan, and closing at 255.5 yuan in the afternoon, with a brief peak at 256.5 yuan. The closing price was 155.2 yuan. Poplin and serge also rose in tandem, with Longevity poplin at 5.9 yuan, Volleyball at 4 yuan, and Three Sheep serge at 5.8 yuan. Chemical fiber sales were lackluster.

Dong Cloth: In the spot market, due to the continuous absorption of high-end fine cloth and Four Gentlemen serge by yarn and flower merchants, the price surge was strong. Yesterday saw another round of sharp increases. 12-pound Dragon Manifest fine cloth opened at 167.5 yuan and steadily rose to close at 178 yuan, a sharp increase of ten yuan per bolt compared to last week. Mid- and low-end fine cloths only saw increases of four to five yuan, such as Colored Ball at 160.75 yuan, Flying Fish at 158.5 yuan, and Trumpet at 154.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge opened at 6.64 yuan and closed at 6.98 yuan in the afternoon, also a surge of three jiao.

### Woolen Fabrics Continue to Decline

Woolen fabrics have been declining in price recently, with no increases. This is due to the arrival of hot weather, the passing of the sales season, and the impact of price controls. Retail prices continue to trend downwards. Retailers and hoarders are successively cutting prices to sell, and the "kick the ball" business has long ceased. As a result, the market is unusually sluggish, and transactions are quite slow. Most men's and women's colored, thick and thin fabrics are fortunate to avoid further price declines.

### Government Bonds Resume Trading with Positive Momentum Yesterday

Yesterday, the government bond market resumed trading after a four-day disinfection and closure of the securities building. Market prices rose slightly, showing signs of an upward trend. The morning opened with retail investors absorbing, and the trend was slightly firm. Class C bonds traded at 39 yuan. However, due to a large volume of selling, prices once fell below the 39 yuan mark, reaching a low of 38.7 yuan. Although retail investors sold heavily at that time, Xinhua, Tongshun, and Tongyu and others actively absorbed, the selling side was ineffective, and the market quickly rebounded strongly. Class C once reached nine. Overall, if there are no special shocks, there is a possibility of continued gains. The total turnover of the city was about one million yuan. The details are listed below.

### Active Investment in Chinese Stocks, Supply and Demand Back on Track

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market continued its upward trend after the surge that began late on Saturday. Investors were active, and with the reopening of the securities building, the various stock companies in the building have returned to their original locations. The excess of supply and demand seen in the previous days has eased, and the market has returned to normal. The opening of the Le Mao Xinji Bank today added a new force, and the long-standing desire for upward movement from all sides contributed to the rise in prices. China Electric saw the strongest gains, rising to the 30 yuan mark, a significant increase of 1.5 yuan. Zhabei Water and Electricity also rose by 0.75 yuan. Greater China Matches broke through the 180 yuan mark, soaring by 7.5 yuan. In the department store sector, China Underwear was the focus of buyers, rising by as much as 2.75 yuan. Yong'an and Xin Xin both rose by 5 yuan. In the cultural sector, China and World Book Company each rose by 5 yuan.

Le Mao Xinji Bank, located on the sixth floor of the Chinese Securities Building, specializes in Chinese stocks to assist in the revitalization of industrial and commercial enterprises. The manager is Yin Wenzhao. The official opening is today, and it will add a unique color to the Chinese stock market.

Twenty loads of Shaanxi black moss have recently arrived. The quality is quite dry, and the market price is 2,100 yuan, but no transactions have been seen due to the high asking price.

### Small Tinplate Purchases are Quite Active

The market supply of 90-pound and 100-pound single-linked small tinplate has been scarce for some time. Yesterday, there was a surge in inquiries and purchases, mostly from small hardware stores buying in bulk. As a result, the market was lively, with busy trading. However, the numbers were not large, but the market sentiment was quite firm. Therefore, dealers had good expectations, and the standard market price showed a slight firming. Currently, each box containing 112 sheets is sold for 1,200 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, with retail prices ranging from 12 yuan to 14 yuan per sheet. Double-linked plates, 20 inches by 28 inches, also containing 112 sheets per box, are priced at 2,300 yuan to 2,400 yuan, but the supply of genuine tinplate in the city is very limited. Most of what is referred to as double-linked plates in Shanghai is actually re-packed in Shanghai. Very few factories in this city use genuine goods, so the trade is now commonplace.

### How to Utilize Free Time

— Hai Lin

(The Youth Department of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association holds a rooftop cool-off gathering every Saturday evening at 8 PM on the tenth floor. The first gathering was on August 1st. The association invited Mr. Chen Rongsheng to give a lecture on the topic of how to utilize free time. Due to the limited space on the rooftop, only a few people could attend. The topic is one that every young person should study, especially during this long summer vacation. It would be a pity not to know how to utilize it. Therefore, I am introducing it to many young friends for reference. However, due to the lecture being held on the rooftop, I was unable to take notes on the spot in the dark. Based on my memory, I have made a brief record as follows:)

The people in the world can be divided into two categories: one category is busy people who are busy all day long for their careers and for society. These people are doctors, lawyers, teachers, workers, farmers... and employees in any company. They benefit society and serve humanity and are indispensable people in the world. The other category is idle people who are idle all day long. They are merely parasites of society, only able to consume and have no productive capacity. Vagrants and beggars are examples of this. These people are naturally unnecessary, and they are bound to be eliminated in the long run.

The successors of these two categories of people are our young people. Everyone has to choose one of these two paths. Of course, we hope to become busy people in the future, not idle people. Yes, being too idle will deplete a person's vitality and strength. Especially during this period of training, we must not relax our efforts and allow idleness to occupy us. Young people only feel that time is too short and insufficient, and will never feel that time is too long and allow it to be idle.

But how exactly do we utilize free time? I believe we can start with the four words in the motto of the Youth Department of the Youth Association: "Virtue, Wisdom, Body, and Community." A young person who possesses all four of these qualities is the ideal person, and society, the country, and humanity all need him to improve.

Virtue: Virtue means morality, character, and ethical conduct. A person with good morals is more valuable than any material treasure. Without it, no matter how profound your knowledge or how strong your body, you are equivalent to a useless person. The world does not need people without morals to exist. For example, if you want to hire an accountant, there are two people for you to choose from. One is a highly knowledgeable accounting talent who can do both Chinese and Western bookkeeping, but he likes to "skim off the top." The other only knows Chinese bookkeeping, but he has noble character and integrity and will never take unjust wealth. Which one would you hire? The latter, without a doubt. This example tells us that having heaven-high knowledge without morality is still being a useless person. Moreover, a person with bad character often has his ability to do evil strengthened by his knowledge. For example, the two brothers in the Father Murder case. If they did not have profound knowledge, they would not have been able to think of using electricity to cause someone's death, nor would they have been able to think of using nitric acid to destroy the body in order to escape punishment. This example tells us that having good knowledge is harmful to him, and it can be understood that virtue is greater than everything else. Now that we have free time, we should use it to cultivate morality, pay attention to our behavior in all places, read more books on self-cultivation and biographies of famous people, and emulate them, in order to cultivate ourselves into people with noble character.

Wisdom: When you are studying, you may complain that you have to do thirty or forty arithmetic problems every day, working yourself to death, and you don't even have time to read some useful extracurricular books! So friends, now it's summer vacation, and you don't have so much homework to do. With a free mind and tireless eyes, you can really make good use of it and fulfill your wishes when you are busy. There are many useful books and many practical skills that you can learn. You must know that it is not easy to find a way out in modern society. It all depends on testing your true talents. Even a trainee position that an elementary school student can take on requires you to pass an exam at the level of a university student. "The superior wins, the inferior are deceived" This rule will be even more pronounced in the future. Quickly use your free time to gain more knowledge. Learning has no limit, so try to acquire as much as possible!

Body: You must know that having a sound body is necessary to achieve a great career. Otherwise, if you have good knowledge and good morals, but your body is weak, how can you contribute your skills to society? Wouldn't you just have to "sigh at your aspirations but be unable to act on them?" Now that it is summer, it is a good time to exercise. You don't necessarily need a gym to exercise, but rather consistency. Then, helping out with household chores is the best method. Currently, every family is reducing the number of servants due to rice shortages. If you can take over part of the work for your parents, how happy they will be! On the one hand, you can exercise your body without interruption, which will definitely be of great help to your health in the future. On the other hand, being able to live in a harmonious family and gain happiness in body and mind is also a method of fitness.

Community: Community means making more beneficial friends. As an old saying goes, "Rely on your parents at home, and rely on your friends when you go out." But relying on your parents is only for about twenty years at most, and the rest of your life, minus those twenty years, is entirely dependent on friends. If a person can make a confidant in his life, the gains are significant. When you are in pain, he will come to comfort you. When you fail in your career, he will come to encourage and help you. This kind of friendship that money cannot buy is inexhaustible for a lifetime. But what is needed are beneficial friends, not friends who are only for drinking and eating. Choosing friends is also one of the things you should pay attention to in life. Otherwise, many people become degenerates due to making bad friends. Therefore, it takes a long time to observe in order to gain a confidant. As the proverb says, "Distance tests a horse's strength, and time reveals a person's heart!" This is what it means. Now everyone should take advantage of this free time to make beneficial friends, and the future mutual assistance will be inexpressible.

Finally, I advise everyone to hoard goods, but don't misunderstand. I don't want everyone to hoard daily necessities, but I hope that young people will take advantage of their free time to hoard more virtue, wisdom, body, and community. Hoarding these things will not only not get you scolded as a profiteer, but it is also a good business of hoarding that everyone advises people to do, and you will definitely make a fortune in the future. Hoard as much as possible!

### Eating and Being a Person

— Yi Min

There are two important things in life: eating and being a person. You cannot succeed in being a person without eating. If you only eat and do not live well, you are called a "rice bucket."

I once saw a couplet hung in a restaurant in Beiping, which read: "Enlarge your belly to eat, and stand firm to be a person." Perhaps the phrase "enlarge your belly" is for the restaurant to attract business, but upon careful thought, these two sentences are also profound truths.

But now, eating is not as easy as it used to be! It takes a lot of effort to get a full meal. How can we "enlarge our belly"?

However, we can be alive for one day, so we must do our duty and be a person for one day, which is what we owe to our true and valuable life. Therefore, we might as well change the above couplet to: "Tighten your belt to eat, and stand firm to be a person." As our motto in this extraordinary period.

### Tidbits

— Zhi Zheng

What is a road? It is trampled out from places where there are no roads, and opened up from places where there are only thorns!

One must survive, two must have adequate food and clothing, and three must develop. Survival is not just living, adequate food and clothing is not luxury, and development is not indulgence.

If you want to survive, you must study!

Only through physical labor can you gain health and promote human solidarity.

Hesitation is worse than recklessness; those who learn to shoot may sometimes hit the target, but those who do not take action will never hit the target.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Sudden Thunder

Mrs. Ye II and Cuizhen went through all the rooms in which Wei Cheng normally sat and lived, and confirmed that Wei Cheng and A Xing had gone out into the snow at night. It was not until a piece of paper was found under the glass mat in Wei Cheng's bedroom, with Wei Cheng's confession, that half of their leaping hearts were put down. On the paper, these few lines were scribbled: "I have a need to visit my brothers and sisters Guo Qi and Guo Fang. However, I am worried that my aunt will not allow it, so I am taking A Xing out on a snowy night. This trip is to Shuangqiao. Why must I travel on a snowy night, and why must I be in Shuangqiao? Someday, my aunt will know. When Cuizhen or other maids and servants discover it tomorrow morning, they should first present this paper to Mrs. Ye II for inspection, so that she can feel at ease. I am going to Shuangqiao with a strong servant, so I am not worried about falling or other dangers. If I do not return by tomorrow evening, I will definitely return by the morning of the day after tomorrow. Wei Cheng left this note. January 28, night."

Mrs. Ye II pursed her lips and said, "Why didn't this child consult with anyone before taking A Xing away? A Xing is the worst. He is not a three-year-old child. He knows that it is snowing and that the weather is so cold. If the young master wants him to go, does he just follow along? When he comes back, I will have to scold him thoroughly!" Cuizhen said, "Second Aunt, don't be angry. I was startled at first, but now I know that he is going to Shuangqiao, and he has A Xing to accompany him, so I am relieved." Mrs. Ye II said, "How can you walk on a snowy road? It says in the novel that Fang Qing fell in the snow, didn't he? And there's that play, South Gate." Mrs. Ye II was still quoting the ancients to prove the present, but Cuizhen was already in Wei Cheng's room, knowing that Wei Cheng was wearing his thick-soled cotton shoes, and also brought an umbrella, a flashlight, and a cane. Later, she also found that he had brought goggles and a Western-style raincoat; although the Western-style raincoat was not as long as a cotton robe, it could still be worn to ward off the cold and rain. Cuizhen was telling Mrs. Ye II about them one by one, and Mrs. Ye II felt a little more relieved. (51)

### Season of Joyful Rain

— Jin Yi

This year's drought is said to have broken the highest record of the Republic of China in 1935. In the cities, epidemics are rampant; in the countryside, the rice crops are all withered, and the people's hope for rain clouds is unparalleled. Sure enough, at noon the day before yesterday, floating clouds gathered, and the north wind came slowly. The country people did not understand astronomy, but they recognized the will of Heaven. My family's old nanny was the first to joyfully report to the crowd: "It's going to rain!"

From 11:35 AM, the sky began to pour down sweet rain. Although intermittent and drizzling, it only rained for ten minutes, and everyone's joy was self-evident. Some said: "This is a sample, maybe it will rain heavily tonight!" Some said: "It's good to cool off!" Some also said, "Autumn begins in two days, this is called 'pre-autumn rain', there will be no problem in the fields!"

Winter is lovely, the summer breeze is pleasant, and the hope for rain during a great drought is naturally the same!

### Cremation

— Yin Yu

A relative's father died, "everything was kept simple," but just a thin, not-so-good coffin caused him to incur a debt of C.R.B. six thousand yuan.

When alive, he didn't pay much attention to life, but after death, he treated the corpse as a treasure.

People must live, but they must also die.

The dead should not burden the living to die.

Letting a beautiful, dazzling fire burn one's corpse into a pile of ashes, instead of rotting together with a log, is better, isn't it?

### Hot indeed! Terribly hot!

— A Heat-Fearing Guest

Pulling a rickshaw: My feet feel like they're walking on boiling oil, yet the master still complains I'm slow as an ant on a hot stone.

Street vendor: Cold drinks, selling water! Shouting at the top of my lungs, ice blocks and ice pops sell out quickly, the price is high, but business is surprisingly good.
Young master: Watermelon and cold drinks; eating and drinking non-stop, yet still complaining his stomach feels like a furnace.

Young miss: Electric fan, doesn't feel cool when blowing on me, quickly build a big icebox, so I can hide inside and avoid the sun.

Rich man: In the bamboo forest, playing mahjong; under the shade of the trees, seeking coolness; even with cool mats and bamboo beds, he still complains of the heat, building ice walls all around.
Madam: Fanning with her left hand, blowing with her right, thin silk dress, light gauze pants, cool breeze seeping into every pore; bossing the servants around, complaining they're too slow.
Farmer: Everyone else can go and enjoy the cool, but I'm toiling in the scorching sun, working doubly hard in the fields.
Water bailer: The fields lack water and need watering, who knows that even if I bail water with all my might, it's still less than the sweat pouring off my body.

Ox: Day and night, endlessly turning the waterwheel, at night looking at the moon and still panting.

Cold drink shop: Ha! You all fear the heat, but I welcome it, selling several big boxes of soda, and hundreds of dozens of wrapped ice pops.

Watermelon vendor: Heh! You complained one hundred yuan for a load of watermelons was too expensive, now they sell for two hundred and forty, and still sell like hotcakes!

Doctor: Good! You fear the heat, eat cold drinks, seek coolness, resulting in a big illness, which makes my business boom, scooping up five hundred, a thousand in my bag.
Pharmacist: Oh! Your good fortune is mine, worried about the lack of general health, truly happy in my heart.

Coffin merchant: Alas! It's a pity there's a shortage of wood, otherwise, a ten-fold profit on a small investment, where else can you find such a good business!

The masses: Humph! You bunch of black-hearted people, rejoicing in others' misfortune, Heaven will not protect you, and you dare feign kindness and say such heartless things!

Jade Emperor: Seeing the hot air rising from the lower realm, not without resentful energy, summon the gods in charge of the stars to discuss the matter.
Venus: Your humble servant is ordered to summon, all the gods are gathered, let's hear their respective reports.

God of Rain: It's not that I don't send rain, but the God of Clouds doesn't spread clouds, the Winds don't cooperate, and the Thunder God and his wife don't help, I alone am powerless.

God of Clouds: The sun is so fierce, all the moisture in the air evaporates, how can I accumulate it into clouds.

God of Wind: Originally, I ordered Pacific hurricanes to come here often to regulate the temperature and spread rain, but this year's meteorological communication was flawed, I fear sudden wind and rain, and the people have no precautions, so last time I reached Shanghai, I turned around and went elsewhere.

Thunder God and Thunder Mother: Just because we went to Shanghai on the first month of the year, and unintentionally caused criticism, we might as well disappear and avoid the limelight.

Drought Demon: Sun Star Lord, you are truly my benefactor, otherwise, how would I have a chance to rise.

God of Plague: The hotter the weather, the better the opportunity for my children to thrive, they are too vigilant against me, I specially use my divine power to show them.
Celestial Physician Star: So that's the reason, no wonder my disciples and grandsons benefit a lot.

Medicine King: My few young apprentices are also getting some advantages.

Jade Emperor: Alas! It is my children who suffer!
