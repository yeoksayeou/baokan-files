### Achet and Nehru to Meet Wavell Today; Cripps Will Participate in the Talks; Gandhi Left New Delhi Yesterday

New Delhi, 3rd (Reuters) – Some members of the Indian National Congress firmly believe that although the current situation is difficult, a solution will ultimately be found. The party chairman, Achet, is scheduled to meet with the Defence Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, General Wavell, who is also the Commander-in-Chief of India, tomorrow, so that the Indian side can understand the severity of India's defence problems. Yesterday afternoon, Cripps met with Achet and Nehru for about 50 minutes. When asked if Cripps would meet with Achet and Nehru again, the response was that he hoped to meet many more times. It is also understood that the resolution submitted by the Congress Working Committee to Cripps yesterday was the result of 30 hours of discussion over five days. Its content is based on the party's previous resolutions, reviewing the British proposals. The committee includes six lawyers, two doctors, and one female poet. Gandhi is not a member of the committee, but he attended all sessions and expressed his views twice. Gandhi was originally scheduled to leave New Delhi yesterday, but will have to delay his departure until today. Cripps is scheduled to hold his next reception for foreign visitors on the 7th of this month, and will use this time to conduct delicate negotiations.

New Delhi, 3rd (Reuters) – The All-India Congress Committee met for 90 minutes today and will reconvene tomorrow morning. President Achet then told reporters that the Congress's resolution on Cripps' proposals will not be released today, and the timing of its release has not yet been determined. Most of today's meeting was spent discussing the progress of the Congress's constructive program. As for the proposed meeting with General Wavell, the date and time have not yet been finalized. He is currently awaiting an indication of the meeting date. Cripps himself will be present at the meeting, and Nehru will accompany him to participate in the talks. It is widely believed that the Congress's resolution may be postponed until after Achet meets with Wavell, and Cripps will report the results of the talks to the British War Cabinet and obtain a response before any announcement is made.

New Delhi, 3rd (Havas) – Officials announced this afternoon that Sir Stafford Cripps met with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, for 90 minutes today.

The Indian National Congress's Answer Delivered to Cripps

New Delhi, 2nd (Havas) – The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress has passed a draft resolution on the proposals put forward by the British side and submitted it to Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy. The meeting discussed this draft resolution for more than 30 hours. A total of ten members participated in the discussion. Mahatma Gandhi also spoke several times, expressing his opinions. Sources in the know believe that this resolution is a declaration of principle, reiterating the previous declarations of the National Congress, especially the declaration of the Badoli meeting in December last year. According to that declaration, the Indian National Congress expressed deep sympathy for all countries fighting for freedom, but this does not mean that India will automatically assist arrogant and self-aggrandizing imperialism. Imperialism's oppression of India is no different from fascism. Only a completely free and independent India can implement self-defence on a national basis.

Allahabad, 3rd (Reuters) – The President of the Muslim League, Jinnah, and other leaders of the League have recently arrived here to attend the annual meeting of the Muslim League. The League's Standing Committee is scheduled to meet this afternoon, and it is expected that the League's reply to the British proposals will be finalized during the meeting.

New Delhi, 2nd (Havas) – Ambedkar and Rao, who claim to be leaders of the "oppressed classes of India," jointly sent a letter to Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, today, opposing the British government's proposals. The letter stated: "We firmly believe that the proposals you bring will be greatly detrimental to the oppressed classes of India, and we believe that the British are attempting to place this class under a hostile Indian legal system, which is beyond doubt. It is known that any action that seeks to return us to the dark ages of the past is unacceptable to us. We will oppose by all means the imposition of this disaster on the Indian nation. We request that you convey our concerns to your government and make it clear that if the oppressed classes are forced to accept a constitution that they have not agreed to and that does not conform to their legitimate aspirations, then we can only consider that the relationship between Britain and India has been severed."

### Japanese Residents on the US Pacific Coast Begin to Move Inland

Lisbon, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) – The rumour that Japanese residents living in the "defence zone" on the Pacific coast of the United States would be relocated inland has been circulating for many days.

Lisbon, 2nd (Domei News Agency) – It is learned here that New Delhi Radio announced that a tense military exercise will be held in Mumbai tomorrow morning.

### Ceylon's Constitutional Issues to be Studied by Britain After the War

Colombo, 2nd (Havas) – The local authorities previously sent a letter inviting Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy, to visit Ceylon, or to send a delegation from Ceylon to New Delhi to discuss the constitutional issues of Ceylon with him. Sir Stafford Cripps replied today that his visit to India is too short and he has no time to discuss the constitutional issues of Ceylon, but Britain will definitely study them after the war ends.

### London Discusses Indian Defence Issues Continuously; Military Conference Held in New Delhi Yesterday; General Wavell Will Request Conscription

New Delhi, 3rd (Havas) – Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, is scheduled to meet with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, at noon today to discuss matters, and is scheduled to convene a military conference in the afternoon, in which General Wavell will also participate.

New Delhi, 3rd (Havas) – It is learned that the British government has granted unlimited power to Sir Stafford Cripps, the envoy to India, to conduct talks with Indian leaders on the spot. After receiving news that the Japanese army had won another victory in Burma, making the situation even more critical, and that it was necessary to immediately conscript millions of men and women in India into military service, the British Cabinet decided to allow Envoy Cripps to freely decide everything. As far as people here know, Cripps will make concessions to the Indian leaders. Reliable sources said that he had notified the leaders of the Indian National Congress, "I do not object to any solution that can reconcile the views of the National Congress and myself." Britain and India are scheduled to hold a military conference here this month, which will be attended by General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, and representatives of the National Congress. At that time, he will request the military conference to pass a resolution authorizing the Indian authorities to immediately begin conscripting men into the army and training Indian troops.

Bern, Switzerland, 2nd (Havas) – The Tribune de Genève recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, had a long telephone conversation with Prime Minister Churchill yesterday. The Indian crisis has reached its peak, as can be seen from this. At this moment, the Indian issue has become the focus of London's attention. In recent days, Prime Minister Churchill has held meetings with the leaders of various political parties to discuss this matter. Londoners also believe that the issue of Indian defence is the most important issue that should be focused on at present, and other political issues should not be discussed at this time. As for finding a compromise, it is not completely hopeless. It should be known that if India abandons its demand to command the war, it cannot be regarded as a loss of prestige. In short, no matter what happens in the future, it is very important for General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, to stay in India, not only to be responsible for deciding strategy, but also to have sufficient power to implement his plans.

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from London, Sir Stafford Cripps hopes that the British War Cabinet will make some concessions to India in terms of national defence, so that the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress can accept the British proposal. Neutral reporters believe that Cripps will allow Indians to command the Indian army and allow Indians to serve as Indian defence ministers, while General Wavell will remain Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, in order to obtain India's cooperation in military affairs and not endanger Britain's rule over India at the same time. It is not yet known whether Cripps has put forward compromise suggestions when meeting with Nehru and Achet. It is said that Achet will meet with General Wavell tomorrow to discuss Indian defence. The London Times declared that the British government will make some concessions in terms of national defence, but General Wavell will still command the war. Cripps hopes that the Indian Congress Party can accept this new proposal after Easter.

Lisbon, 2nd (Domei News Agency) – According to a New Delhi dispatch from the United Press, Cripps's negotiations with India have reached the brink of rupture due to opposition from various parties and factions in India below the National Congress. In order to try to reverse the situation, Cripps plans to establish a new Indian Minister of Defence in order to win the favour of various factions. It is said that he is currently seeking instructions from his own government. According to Cripps's plan, he intends to appoint an Indian as the Indian Minister of Defence, and the Indian Defence Council, which is jointly organized by General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British and Indian Army, and others, will be under his command, intending to thereby suppress the dissatisfaction of Indians with Indian defence. However, the powers of the Minister of Defence are limited to defence training and other aspects, which is far from the demands of the Indian side. The National Congress Party has already expressed dissatisfaction.

German Commentary on the Development of the Indian Situation

Berlin, 2nd (Havas) – Semi-official sources here recently stated that the recent development of the Indian situation shows that Sir Stafford Cripps's mission has failed. The British side has gradually realized that the sentiment of Indian nationalism is far stronger than they had expected. The appeal of the Indian people in Berlin, the declaration of the Japanese authorities, and the criticisms of the Italian newspapers are all sufficient to prove that the Axis powers fully support the Indian independence movement. Sir Stafford Cripps's decision to postpone his departure clearly wants to make his last effort to eliminate obstacles, but the situation is extremely clear, that is, Sir Stafford Cripps's mission has completely failed.

Berlin, 2nd (Havas) – Various newspapers have written articles commenting on the Indian issue. Among them, the Völkischer Beobachter stated that the British newspapers have admitted that the speeches made by Sir Stafford Cripps, the envoy to India, have not only failed to improve the situation, but have made the Indian National Congress even more suspicious of the Churchill government. Bose, the leader of the Indian National Congress, said today that India fully recognizes that Britain has no other intention but to divide India and weaken its strength. The last attempt of the British to fool the Indian people must be resolutely opposed, which can truly express the sentiments of all members of the Indian National Congress.

### Burma of the Buddhist Country (Part 2): Reverence for Monks

As mentioned before, monks are one of the "three many" in Burma, and it can almost be said that the entire country is monks. The beauty of the natural environment is indeed one of the reasons for the prevalence of monks, but the maternal education of Burmese women also contributes to it. Look at the custom of Burmese women: the most important thing in their lives is to raise several sons to become monks. According to Buddhist teachings: "The merit of making a son a monk can ascend to heaven." Therefore, mothers who have sons will make them monks as soon as possible. Those who do not have sons will take a sum of money and help the sons of poor people become monks. This is not for them to gain face, but to do good deeds for themselves. This behavior is not a custom, but a belief. Not having a son is just unfortunate, but if you have a son and refuse to let him become a monk, it is a sin. Moreover, society regards monks as the most noble figures. Burmese people must have been monks once to be considered adults and have the qualifications to marry!

Before becoming a monk, one must be questioned by a senior monk. One must sincerely convert to Buddhism and abide by all rules before shaving one's head in front of the Buddha to become a monk.

Each district in Burma has a bishop called "Gaing Ok," meaning "patriarch." In Mandalay, there is also a great religious leader called "Tha Thana Boing." Each temple has a "Phongyi" (i.e., a Dharma master) who must have ten years of experience, and an assistant to manage the temple affairs and teach the disciples. During the Burmese kingdom, the Burmese king had to kneel barefoot to see the archbishop. At that time, although monks did not participate in politics, they had great power to protect criminals and control everything. Although politics have changed now, monks still receive the automatic belief of the Burmese people. In short, in Burma, no matter if he is a layman who shaved his head and put on a cassock yesterday, he is considered sacred. From this, it can be seen the general importance that the Burmese people attach to the yellow cassock.

The most important precept for monks is not to approach women. Even feminine animals are not allowed to be touched. When a monk enters a two-story house, he must ask: "Is there a woman upstairs?" for fear of defiling his precious head. If someone asks: "If you (referring to a monk) see your biological mother fall into a ditch, what should you do?" He replied: "You can give her a stick or a rope, turn your face away from her, and pull her out like pulling wood."

The heads of Burmese monks do not have incense scars. The yellow cassock they wear is composed of three pieces of yellow cloth (sometimes silk). The first piece covers the lower body, the second piece wraps around the left shoulder and hangs down to the feet, exposing the right shoulder, and the third piece acts as a coat, covering the head. They often hold a string of prayer beads, wear leather slippers, and carry a round cattail-leaf fan. Sometimes they use a long-handled paper umbrella when going out, with a servant to shield them from the sun. Because in tropical Burma, the fierce sunlight is unbearable for bald heads!

When the sky is dim, and birds chirp and crows caw, the large and small bells in each temple ring loudly. At this time, the monks go to the Buddha to worship, pray, and chant scriptures, eat a little food, and then gather in a team to leave the temple to beg for food. Led by the old monk, two young acolytes carry a bamboo pole with a bronze chime hanging on it, chiming as they walk. They hold large food bowls in their hands. Cunning monks hang the food bowl on the pole and lower it in front of their chests, saving them from sore hands. When passing by the gate of a generous family, they stand silently, letting people donate. Courteous monks have the alms giver open and close the bowl cover, indicating that they are not begging. After receiving the food, they leave silently without even saying thank you. In Buddhist doctrine, giving food and begging for food have the same merit, so everyone plans for their own happiness without being polite.

Buddhist doctrine says that monks must beg for food for the day and absolutely abstain from killing. However, they can eat anything, as long as it is not something they killed themselves. They only eat one meal a day and fast after noon, only drinking cold water. Therefore, they often eat too much breakfast and then starve for the whole afternoon.

Smoking is forbidden, but betel nuts can be chewed because they help contemplation. The monks display all the miscellaneous foods begged for the day on the dining table. The Dharma master tastes it first, and then the disciples can enjoy it. Then it is the turn of the temple servants, and the remaining leftovers are given to the beggars and poor people at the temple gate, or fed to the mangy dogs and crows in the temple.

The monks' daily duties include receiving pilgrims, lecturing on festivals, and chanting scriptures for people. These are just the monks' side jobs. The most important thing is to concentrate on reading scriptures and chanting Buddha's name, practicing diligently, to attain enlightenment and become a Buddha. Therefore, famous old Burmese monks, in addition to begging for food, reading scriptures, worshiping Buddha, and preaching to people on Sundays, do not ask about other mundane affairs. Burmese monks have a special duty: educating students. Burmese schools are temples, and monks are teachers, because most monks are intellectuals in Burma, and parents also hope that their sons will develop religious concepts early. Temple education is not profound: reading and writing Burmese, teaching the calculation of years, months, and days; history and geography are very simple, and most of the time is spent memorizing classics and Buddhist stories, and learning to pray. Temple schools do not have chairs, desks, or other equipment; everyone sits on the ground. Beginning children only like to hear myths and stories, and older children are only allowed to specialize in the classics. The British government believed that the monks controlled the entire Burmese education system and must be reorganized. Several consultations with the monks were opposed. Now, because the education received by the Burmese in the monk temples is empty and cannot earn a living, they are ostracized by society, and many have entered the missionary schools of England and the United States or local government schools to study. However, many rural monk temple schools still have their importance.

Burmese monks sleep very hard. They can only rest at nine o'clock in the evening, sleeping on the floor without mattresses or mosquito nets. They are not allowed to swat mosquitoes or catch bedbugs. If they accidentally touch them, they must quickly release them.

Monks not only receive many respects during their lifetime, but also enjoy extraordinary grand ceremonies after their death. The faithful believe that monks are disciples of the Great Buddha, and their souls will travel to the Buddhist country as soon as they leave the mortal world, the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss. Therefore, the "parinirvana" of monks is called "Pohn Gyee Byan," meaning that the Dharma master has ascended to the Western Paradise. This is indeed something worth celebrating, so the funeral is very grand.

In the past, as soon as the monk's soul left the body, the corpse would be carried away by his great benefactor and disciples, his belly opened, and his intestines removed and buried near the pagoda or temple. The empty belly cavity would be filled with hot ashes, sawdust, spices, and other things, and then the incision would be sewn up. Sometimes wax is applied to the corpse, and then a long cloth is wrapped from head to toe to form a bundle, coated with tung oil, or gilded. The monk's coffin is different from that of ordinary people. It is not made of several planks, but is hollowed out from a single piece of wood. The outside of the coffin is coated with tung oil, or gilded, and placed in the outer coffin "Payoung Bohn." A dragon is usually hung above the outer coffin.

At the same time, in order to raise money for the funeral, elderly people in nearby villages, service monks, and senior disciples build a high altar, called "Theln" in Burmese, which is the coffin hall in China, inside which are arranged many religious banners, flags, color pictures, paper towers, paper chains, and other things, waiting for pilgrims to come to chant scriptures, offer flowers and fruits, and acknowledge the amount of donations to handle the funeral.

After sufficient funeral expenses are raised, a seven-story square pagoda-style "cremation altar," or Nirvana Hall, is built in the meadow outside the city, about fifteen to twenty feet high. The elders in charge of the funeral in the town choose an auspicious day. The funeral is held. When the auspicious day arrives, people flock in like a tide. People from each village and town carry sacrificial objects similar to the "cremation altar." All pagoda-shaped objects are used to surround the central altar. After a grand ceremony, the coffin is raised high to the top of the "cremation altar." A large amount of fuel is piled underneath, and the closest relatives of the deceased light the fire with matches. As for the corpses of noble monks, fire must be obtained by drilling wood to show the purity of the monk. The "cremation altar" gradually burns up. Young men and women dance and praise the power of the fireworks and the happiness they will gain from setting off fireworks and burning the "cremation altar." When it burns to the last layer of the "cremation altar," the sound of bamboo bursting is like a gunshot, and the cheers of the crowd gradually rise. The large cremation altar collapses, and the funeral ends in the shouts of the crowd. The closest relatives of the deceased find the remains and bury them near the pagoda. If the remains of a famous monk, they must be crushed, mixed with tung oil, and molded into a Buddha statue for worship in the temple. Such funerals often cause casualties in Upper Burma. Lower Burma is much safer because of strict police regulations.

Burmese men dream of being monks all their lives, longing for the glory of life and death. It seems that there is no other pursuit besides being a monk to seek happiness. When will this monk's dream wake up?

### Germany to Launch Spring Offensive Once Climate Improves; Actively Completing Preparations; Soviet Offensive Also Underway

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Havas) Military figures here recently stated that German forces in the eastern theater, especially in the Staraya Russa region south of Lake Ilmen, are currently launching a major counteroffensive. This has also been acknowledged by the Soviet side. The number of German officers and soldiers is large, far exceeding that of the Red Army. However, their main purpose is to straighten the battle lines, but this cannot be considered the start of the spring offensive. According to responsible figures in the German diplomatic community yesterday, the German Army High Command did not remain idle last winter but gained much experience from operations in the eastern theater, which is very different from what it gained from operations in the western theater. Therefore, their preparation for the next major battle is very meticulous, and they can take into account all possible developments. The military spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement confirming that German reserve troops never joined the winter operations. These reserve troops are all re-deployed behind the battle lines according to the plan, engaged in preparations. Also, because the German Air Force has absolute superiority, the Soviet side has never been able to disrupt the German preparations. The German army holds the points of resistance, standing still. Although the Red Army's repeated attacks were extremely fierce, they failed to break through the German defense line. The only result was to weaken the Red Army's ability to launch an offensive. In short, the German army has been able to prepare calmly. The German technical service team has increased in winter, all assisting the front-line troops in combat in the rear. This unit includes a large number of engineers, technicians, workers, artillerymen, ambulances, and journalists. There are various indications to be credible. The German army is currently busy completing preparations for the spring offensive. Once the weather improves and the soil is firm, which is conducive to military operations, the spring offensive will begin. However, the date of the start of the spring offensive is still difficult to determine at this moment. According to general speculation, after several weeks of calm on the front line, the German army will launch a large-scale offensive again. The Soviet Union, it is said, is making every effort to make full use of the time. According to reliable sources, the Soviet offensive is increasing and is now underway. The Red Army Headquarters issued a battle report only involving the Kalinin region. The Red Army recovered nine villages in the Rzhev region. The Pravda also reported that the Red Army recovered thirty-four villages and broke through the German defense line. As of now, the city of Rzhev is still in the hands of the German army. Before this city is recovered, other victories claimed by the Soviet Union are not very important. As for the Staraya Russa region, fierce fighting took place between February 26 and 29. German battle reports confirmed that the Soviet Union exerted strong pressure on the southeast of Lake Ilmen and the northeast of the Novgorod region. However, the Red Army's repeated attacks were unsuccessful and suffered heavy losses.

German War Report

Headquarters of the German Leader, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) This afternoon's German war report stated that although the enemy army in Eastern Europe still has counter-offensive actions, the momentum is not as strong as before. The German army counter-attacked and occupied several places. A large Soviet oil ship was hit by a group of German fighter planes and caught fire. Near the Kerch Peninsula, a large merchant ship was damaged. In North Africa, German planes hit two enemy merchant ships near Tobruk. Six British planes were shot down. The airfield and other military facilities in the port of Valletta were bombed day and night. A group of German destroyers shot down four British planes. Last night, they attacked the port facilities of Dover and Rotterdam again, causing a large fire and explosions that shook the distance. In February and March of this year, German warships not only bombed enemy merchant ships but also attacked British and American warships. The Navy sank one cruiser, eight destroyers, three plane gunboats, four torpedo boats, twelve motor torpedo boats and gunboats, and three submarine destroyers. German planes sank two motor gunboats and three patrol boats. A total of 37 enemy warships were damaged, including ten cruisers, eleven destroyers, and five submarines.

### German Military Circles Comment on the Situation in the Near East

Berlin, 2nd (Havas) Military figures here recently commented on the situation in North Africa and the Near East, saying that Britain's supply line in the Mediterranean is extremely long and dangerous. Transportation for the Axis powers is not only convenient and fast, but also easy to defend. In practice, Britain has almost adopted a defensive posture and can no longer control the ocean. The British island of Malta is constantly subjected to bombing by the Axis air force, and German and Italian submarines are also active in the Mediterranean, attacking British merchant convoys, making it impossible for Britain to defend itself in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean can be divided into eastern, central, and western regions. If British warships want to pass through a region, they will inevitably be attacked. In short, it has become extremely difficult for Britain to organize merchant convoys, and the supply of both warring parties is tied to the overall situation, especially the Allied supply line, which is extremely long and difficult to protect.

### The Case of French Officials Endangering the Country; Lyon Court Scheduled to Resume Trial

Lyon, 2nd (Havas) The Lyon Supreme Court continued its trial of the case of officials endangering the country today. General Marthe spoke, stating that "At the beginning of the current European war, France had only 1,400 anti-aircraft guns of various types, while the military authorities needed at least 5,900. Moreover, these anti-aircraft guns were old and could not destroy new aircraft. The reservists had no technical ability, and most reserve officers neglected training and could not receive training seriously. The reason for this was that there were many bureaucratic procedures, and everyone did not know that they were in wartime. In June 1939, Daladier summoned me to inquire, and I immediately told him the truth. Daladier immediately replied that the shortage of anti-aircraft guns was indeed the truth. I also admitted that it was very urgent to allocate more funds to purchase anti-aircraft guns as reserves, but it could not be realized due to bureaucratic procedures. In 1938, I personally ordered large cannons for the navy to be used by the anti-aircraft artillery team, but at that time, no one believed in the effectiveness of anti-aircraft guns. This was the main mistake. Since we do not believe in the function of the sword, we believe that it is useless to make shields." Then, Generals Vielle and Bénet spoke one after another, strongly stating that the French army felt a shortage of boots, military blankets, and other items. 7 million pairs of leather shoes were originally needed, but only 3 million pairs were actually available. 5 million blankets were originally needed, but only 3 million were available at that time. In addition, there was insufficient military expenditure. After the outbreak of the current European war, France had achieved great achievements in the first few months. It was a pity that it was too late. Our army had complete military equipment in the spring of 1940, but the military supplies depot in Troyes, eastern France, had newly manufactured military uniforms worth 4 million francs, and by May, our country was manufacturing 2 million pairs of leather boots and 1 million blankets per month. Then, Daladier spoke again, expressing surprise at General Bénet's so-called insufficient distribution of military supplies, and said that regarding this matter, whether the French people believe in the work of the Fifth Column, that is, whether they believe that intellectuals should spread defeatism, is correct. I have to ask myself this. I must warn the court that in order to understand General Bénet's words, I will request additional witnesses. Finally, General Bénet spoke again, saying that due to the uneven distribution of fodder by the military supply department, many horses starved to death. Between November 1939 and March 1940, a total of four horses starved to death. At this point, the Supreme Court announced the adjournment and scheduled to resume the trial on the 14th.

### Chile's New President Ríos Takes Office, Urging People to Unite and Adhere to Pan-American Federal Relations

Santiago, Chile, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The new President Ríos held his inauguration ceremony in the Hall of Honor of the National Congress today. Argentine President and Foreign Minister Kina Su, Spanish Argentine Ambassador Sendo, French Ambassador to Argentina Berudon, French Minister to Chile Dupuville, and many military attachés from various countries' embassies attended the ceremony.

Santiago, Chile, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - President Ríos stated to the press that "The new government is based on the Socialist Party and the Radical Democratic Party and will lean left. Speaking for myself, I have participated in various left-wing parties. However, the government needs labor and management to cease their struggles to allow the revitalization plan implemented by the previous president to be realized. As for Foreign Minister Jierba and Finance Minister Madralun, they are both non-partisan leaders and are participating in the new government only as experts. The president, according to the constitution, is the highest leader of the country. Diplomatic relations and economic and financial policies are subject to his control. In terms of diplomacy, our country will maintain diplomatic relations with all countries in the world but will still adhere to the unified relations of the Pan-American Federation according to the will of the people. In addition, the government will protect all religious and intellectual freedoms. Any difficulties that weaken sovereignty, hinder production, or harm public undertakings will not be tolerated. In short, I deeply hope that the people of the country will unite and cooperate sincerely to realize the aspirations of a great nation.”

### German Warships Intercept Norwegian Merchant Fleet

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Eleven Norwegian merchant ships, which had fled to the port of Gothenburg, Sweden, for refuge since the outbreak of the war, recently attempted to escape to England. However, when they arrived at the Kattegat Strait, they were intercepted by German warships. Previously, the eleven Norwegian merchant ships set sail from the port of Gothenburg on March 31. A few hours after departure, they were attacked by German warships from Norway. From midnight to 4:00 AM on the second day, residents along the Swedish coast heard continuous gunfire. At dawn, several Swedish fishermen went fishing along the coast and saw several ships on fire. However, the number of burning ships reported by witnesses varied. It is widely believed that the Norwegian merchant fleet lost at most three ships, two of which sank and one was damaged. Afterwards, two Norwegian merchant ships returned to the port of Gothenburg. The fate of the remaining six ships is still unknown. Some of them may have escaped from the Kattegat Strait under the cover of British aircraft and sailed to the Skagerrak Strait, where British warships are located. The exact number of crew members killed is unknown. According to local fishermen, they met a German fishing boat that rescued the entire crew of a Norwegian cargo ship.

### German Foreign Ministry Pays Close Attention to Turkish Trial of Assassination Attempt on Ambassador Papen

Berlin, 3rd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The German Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that they are paying close attention to the trial in Turkey of the assassination attempt on Ambassador Papen. No other comments are made at present.

Istanbul, Turkey, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The court here opened today to try the suspects in the assassination attempt on Ambassador Papen. The first to testify was Abdullah Rahman, who stated that he came to Turkey in 1938. Two years later, he was introduced to Milovitch. Then he was introduced to Gornilov by the public. Later, he met with the two men in Istanbul. Suleiman was also present. The four of them had a secret conversation. He then agreed to carry a briefcase containing certain documents to the Soviet Embassy. Later, Abdullah Rahman met with Stephen and practiced using a pistol in Stephen's bedroom, attempting to assassinate the German ambassador. The pistol found in the case is the same as this pistol. Later, Stephen carried a time bomb without gunpowder to Abdullah Rahman's bedroom. Recently, another person named Omen, hired by the Soviet Embassy, ​​went from Istanbul to Ankara and was also tasked with assassinating Ambassador Papen. At this point, the judge asked what the motive for this action was. According to Suleiman, the Soviet Union wanted to cause disputes between Germany and Turkey, thereby forcing Turkey to fight against the Axis powers. Abdullah Rahman then said that Omen did not know that the box he was carrying contained explosives. He now realized that the Soviet Union was a cowardly assassin. During the court hearing, Pavlov, who was about fifty years old, opened a collection of poems and recited them silently to show that he did not care about this at all.

### Kangtai Warehouse Coal Theft; Coal Shop Owner Arrested

Recently, 14 tons of white coal worth more than 7,000 yuan were found missing from the Kangtai Foreign Company warehouse on North Szechuan Road. A report was made to the Yangshupu Police Station, and the criminals were arrested. Through the clues of the Chinese detective Shen Yuzhou, the suspects Han Wancai, Wang Asan, Wang Ajin, Hu Ada, Wang Yushou, Wang Laosi, Zhang Renhao, Wang San, Zhu Awu, Tongzhou native Hu Xingsheng, Ningbo native Li Ahua and other twelve persons (coal porters and drivers at the Rulan Road wharf) were arrested at the North Szechuan Road wharf and other places. It was also found that a part of the stolen coal was sold to the Dashen Coal Shop at No. 466 Avenue Edward VII. Detective Shen, based on this report, then collaborated with the Western detectives and the Xinzha Police Station to rush to the coal shop, arrested the shareholder and manager Ye Haoquan (a Ningbo native), seized several tons of the original stolen white coal, and brought them back to the police station together. Yesterday, the criminals and the receiver Ye Haoquan were brought to the case. Ye hired lawyer Fan Gang and claimed that the coal he bought was purchased at a fair price from the market and that he did not know it was stolen. He requested bail. The other defendants also hired lawyer Gu Ruwen, claiming that the suspects arrested were not involved in the case and were mistakenly arrested. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation and verification.

### Today is Children's Day; Appeal for Relief for Abandoned Children

Today is the 11th Chinese Children's Day. Various child welfare organizations in the city will hold recreational activities to celebrate. The Children's Day was initiated by the China Child Welfare Association. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, it submitted a request to the National Government to promulgate measures for the commemoration of Children's Day for the purpose of promoting children's well-being and advancing the child welfare movement. According to Mr. Ding Bingnan, the general affairs secretary of the Child Welfare Association, the enthusiasm of all sectors of society to celebrate Children's Day in the city every year is extraordinarily exciting. As this year's Children's Day approaches, due to the impact of the war in the city, everything has become expensive and life is difficult. Abandoned children on the streets are shocking. If we do not plan for rescue early, it will inevitably become a serious social problem in the future. Every time I think of this, I cannot help but feel sad. Most child welfare organizations are limited by funds and cannot accept more children. In the future, I hope that all charitable organizations will uphold the spirit of mutual assistance, make overall plans, and work together to solve this problem. I also hope that enthusiastic people in society will uphold their past enthusiasm for disaster relief and donate generously so that funds are available, so that these abandoned street children can receive appropriate education and upbringing.

### Quarrel Over Mahjong Leads to Knife Attack on Spectator

Xu Songyao, a 20-year-old apprentice from Ningbo at the Huasheng Cotton Mill at No. 64 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, invited his colleagues to play mahjong in the factory when he was free the night before. The old administrator Wang Aqing (34 years old) watched from the side. During a tense situation, he suddenly interjected and pointed out mistakes, which angered Xu. A conflict arose between the two parties. It started with a verbal argument, and then Xu suddenly held a kitchen knife and slashed Wang's left arm three times without asking why. Blood flowed like a river, and he fell to the ground in pain. His colleagues went out to report to the police and arrested Xu. They took the murder weapon to the police station. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment, and Xu was detained pending further investigation after he recovers from his injuries.

### Extend Care to Children, and to the Children of Others

People accustomed to urban life rarely forget holidays. For example, on April 1st, there were "Chen Yunshang Assassinated" and other April Fool's Day programs in the newspapers; and the "Foreign Qingming Festival," chocolate Qingming eggs have long been displayed alongside corn cakes in glass windows; today - April 4th, who doesn't know it is "Children's Day," a festival belonging to children?

"The plan for the year lies in spring," and the plan for a lifetime lies in infancy. Facing the festival of these future masters, we will not forget the necessary "embellishments." Opening the newspaper, the first thing that catches our eyes is the "Children's Discounted Price for Little Friends" theater advertisement. Entertainment is spiritual food. In the past, cinemas had "Children's Morning Sessions," which were used to raise the flag of "Educating Children"; however, children rarely accept this kind of "Burning" "Bai Guang" and other "Forced Education." It is better to arrange a "Paradise" "World" and the like, which can arouse their interest. Unfortunately, this kind of "Benefit Children" facility was held early on Christmas Day. There is only one Children's Day festival, or rather only one day, so why should we criticize the only "Children's Discounted Price for Little Friends" embellishment? It is usually difficult to get this "Entertainment Fee" from parents, and today, perhaps a "Special Fee" can be opened under the expenditure item!

Then does that mean that this year's "Children's Day" will be so bleak?

I ask people who embody "Extend care to children, and to the children of others" to broaden their horizons to the scope you can see - in fact, this "scope" is right in front of you.

Perhaps just this morning, when you stepped out of the threshold, a stiff child lay across your feet. If he is not dead, he is also taking his last breath; or even dead. However, when you come home from work, he is still lying in the same place...

At the Rue Kim Road bus stop, I meet that child every day. He doesn't seem to have received the "Beggar Education" of the "Old Man." He can't say a series of "Ladies and gentlemen, please do good deeds"; he won't seize the good opportunity for every couple waiting for the tram. He can't even say a few sentences of "Yangjingbang" (because this is an international bus stop): but without speaking, who knows he is begging? He has a slogan, which is: "The child's belly is starving to death!" This is such an indecent and uncultured "Phrase"...

At the back door of a large hotel (people who are accustomed to urban life should understand that their business is lodging "Local Travelers"), that back door is in the alley, where there are often groups of children stationed. There is a stove in the kitchen, and the warmth transmitted through the "Layered Wall" makes their single clothes enough to withstand the cold spring. This is naturally a good place to beg, but the biggest reason is that the "Last Course" poured out from the kitchen every day often results in broken heads and bloodshed! ...

There is a newborn baby lying in the trash can. The first nanny who comes to take out the trash is sure that it is an "Illegitimate Child." This is naturally the view of people who are accustomed to urban life, or the "Master" that the nanny serves only has a young mistress and no young master. A couple in our back building, who have been married for ten years, had a big fight last night because the father threw away a newborn baby. They already have two sons and three daughters!…

-Does the "scope" seem too broad?

That's right! Where can a mansion of thousands of rooms be found? Even a garden house must leave a piece of grass as a place to rest. But what if we narrow this vast "scope" to a "focus"?

Speaking of things, there are things that are easy to pick up. Yesterday, the "Social Service Column" of this newspaper had two letters from Ding Fubao pleading for the orphans of the Shanghai Fuyouyuan and Guan Jiong pleading for the expansion of production at the Jingye Orphanage. These ninety orphans have been rescued from fire and water, how can we bear to see them "Not having enough clothes to keep warm; and not having enough food to cure hunger"? The Jingye Orphanage has moved from consumption to production, is this most basic "focus" necessarily "Not something that can be saved by those who are not powerful"!

Accumulating points into lines, accumulating lines into surfaces, as long as there is a heart of "Extend care to children, and to the children of others", we do not need a festival like "Children's Day."

### Painting and Paper

- Jian Xiao

In modern times, Shanghai painters are known as the Four Great Masters, namely the Three Wus and One Feng. Among the Three Wus, Huh Fan and Zishen are from the Wu school family, and they have collected many famous works of ancient people. Influenced by what they hear and see, their brushstrokes and inks all have a history. Daitqiu is the son of Shimeng Botao, and he is the oldest, but his dust has not been cleaned, and he lacks change; Chaoran is good at both figures and landscapes, and his meticulous and elegant style is very similar to Xinluo Shanren. Huh Fan's layout is exquisite and skillful, and his coloring is beautiful and elegant. His meticulous works are very close to Shizhou Hengshan, and he is not easy to put his pen down recently. Zishen's brush is full of ink and directly approaches Dong Xuanzai and Wang Xilu. He is also good at orchids and bamboos. He uses Zhao (Mengfu) and Wen (Zhengming) as the method. Every stroke has a history. I have the opportunity to interact with the painters, personally experience the joy of writing and inking, and hear the beginnings and ends, which are harmful.

Painters attach importance to brush, paper, ink, and color. All four are indispensable. After the Tongguang soldiers in the former Qing Dynasty, the old storage of paper with good sizing from the Zhejiang area, was destroyed (The paper is said to be produced in Xuancheng, Anhui). The goods on the market are often rough and perfunctory, loose and difficult to write on. The products produced in the last ten years are even more inferior. Because of the urgent demand for production, chemical products are used to make them melt earlier. Although the color is white and easy to deceive the market, it is easy to seep when writing and not durable for long-term storage. Shanghai painters have heard that Wu Zishen and Huh Fan have old paper in their collections. Friends who invite them to paint often compensate them. This is a great disaster for painters and calligraphers. Since the Qing Dynasty, in the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, folding fans and fan surfaces have been replaced with small fans. The old cold gold heavy mica has been discarded. Although Shulianji in Hangzhou is famous at home and abroad for its fan surfaces, most of the factories are in Suzhou, and they are mostly produced by Suzhou people. They are rough and negligent, reluctantly coping with the task. Calligraphers and painters get them, and they don't know whether to laugh or cry. This is really a great loss to our country's culture and art. In the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, the Zhuiyun Pavilion Paper Shop in Jiaxing used the old method to make cold gold fan surfaces, which were excellent. At that time, the price of gold was not expensive, and each page of double-sided gold was sold for five yuan. I have seen Huh Fan and Zishen paint on it, which is very similar to the taste of the Ming Dynasty. They cherish it as if it were a treasure. Unfortunately, the price of gold is very expensive in modern times, and it is no longer made. The old alum fan surfaces purchased on the market are mostly made of straw paper and have no mica at all. Regardless of ink and color, they are dull and without luster. I heard that Zishen's family has more than a hundred pages in their collection, but they are slightly yellow and the sauce has been de-glued. Before writing on them, they must be repaired and framed by a framer before they can be used. Apart from that, only old families may have some in their collections. I don't know about them.

Examining the reason why the quality of paper and fan surfaces in recent times is not as good as before, it is not that modern workers are clumsy, nor is it that raw materials are unavailable, "but because the cost of labor and materials is too high, the selling price must be expensive, it is difficult to sell, and merchants are ignorant, only seeking immediate gains, and have no long-term plans," then it is because calligraphers and painters in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China did not learn from the ancients, and used thick brushes and heavy ink to fill the paper. There is no need for five shades of ink, and no one advocates it. Why should the manufacturers strive for excellence? It is appropriate for them to decline day by day and be unworthy of writing on.

### Homecoming Permits Issued as Usual During Easter Holiday; Half-Price Tickets for Jinmen Maru Expire on the 7th; Main Route Ship Tickets for Shanghai-Ningbo Route Sold Out

The Public Works Department will be on Easter holiday starting yesterday and will resume work on the 6th. The office for issuing homecoming permits will still issue homecoming permits as usual. Today and tomorrow, it will also issue permits all day long to facilitate the application of citizens leaving Shanghai. The other branch offices will also issue homecoming permits in the same way and will not be closed for holidays.

Half-Price Tickets to Xiamen Expire on the 7th

The Jinmen Maru of the East Asia Shipping Company is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 9th and sail to Xiamen. The ship has contacted the authorities through the Chinese Evacuation Association to reserve 200 half-price berths to facilitate the transportation of fellow Fujianese who do not need to stay in Shanghai. The registration is handled by the Fujian Fellow Association in Shanghai. The registration will now close on the 7th.

Many Ningbo Residents Return Home

Since February, a total of no less than 50,000 to 60,000 Ningbo residents have returned home. The number of people registering for travel permits recently is even greater than before. However, because there are many returnees, there are only five ships: Haitong, Hualin, Huawan, Naruto, and Changshan. Each ship can only carry a maximum of 500 passengers. Therefore, there are many people and few ships, and tickets are not easy to buy. The Naruto and Changshan have recently changed to berth at the Swire Wharf, and passengers can board the ship directly. The Hualin, Huawan, and Haitong are still berthed at Yangshupu and are transferred by small boats, which is quite troublesome. Therefore, passengers tend to go to the Naruto and Changshan to seek convenience. It is heard that tickets for the 8th of this month for the two ships have been sold out. It is now heard that the departure dates of the ships this month are the 4th for Changshan and the 7th for Naruto, but all tickets have been sold out.

Some Wenzhou Residents Return Home

The Wenzhou Hotel Fellow Association previously set up an office to facilitate fellow villagers returning home in order to register those who were eager to return home, and then planned group return procedures. This move by the association was purely to facilitate fellow villagers, so at one time, the number of people who went to register exceeded 1,200. Because the Shanghai-Wenzhou route has been suspended for a long time, all direct ships must ask the Ningbo authorities to allocate them. They are currently consulting and requesting this, but a very small number of return passengers are unable to stay in Shanghai for a long time, and are forced by life to return via Shenjiamen or Ningbo. The majority of fellow villagers are still waiting for the Ningbo authorities to allocate ships to transport them back to Wenzhou.

### Dispute Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law; Both Parties Reached a Settlement

Former French Police Chinese Inspector Shen Defu, retired in old age, now resides at No. 1, Lane 412, Rue Eugène Bard - which is self-owned property, and lives in peace with his sons, daughters-in-law, grandchildren, and granddaughters. However, there is a slight discord between Shen's wife, née Gu, and his daughter-in-law, Shen Hu Huiyun. At midnight on the 18th of last month, Shen's daughter-in-law chastised her son, which caused a conflict between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Gu even resorted to violence, but was stopped by others. The next day, Shen Hu Huiyun requested a medical examination from the French Concession authorities and sued her mother-in-law, Gu, for assault. After one summons, the case was adjourned. Yesterday, the hearing continued. Both parties arrived with their lawyers, and Shen also arrived at the court, ready to testify. After persuasion, the two parties reconciled, and Shen Hu Huiyun withdrew the lawsuit. A family dispute was declared closed, and they left with smiles.

### Jianghai Customs Abolishes Internal and External Duty System; Revises Employee Leave Regulations

The Shanghai Jianghai Customs has recently established a Planning Section, headed by Japanese Honda Tadashi, with the intention of fully revitalizing Customs administration and has decided to stop publishing all Customs statistics published by Jianghai Customs in the past. It has also recently abolished the system of internal and external duty shifts for Customs officers and revised the employee leave regulations. In the past, the staff of the Jianghai Customs Tax Department had a distinction between internal and external duty shifts, which has now been abolished. Four departments have been established: Administration, Supervision, Inspection, and Patrol. As for the leave regulations for Customs officers, in the past, they were entitled to one year to six months of leave every five or six years. In the future, it is proposed to change it to six months of leave every six years, and all employees will be treated equally.

### The Two Concession Authorities Strictly Forbid Carrying Goods Out of the Territory and Prevent Price Increases, Encouraging Reporting and Informing

The price management committees of the two concessions have recently become more active in their work to suppress the selling prices of goods. Speculative merchants have clearly suffered a serious threat. According to news from the French Concession Price Management Committee yesterday, the committee has now consulted with the Public Concession's Public Works Department and other relevant authorities to discuss concrete and effective measures to continue stabilizing the commercial market. The two authorities have recently jointly agreed on the following two points: Strictly prohibit merchants or citizens from carrying various goods. Any merchant or citizen carrying any goods must allow inspection upon inquiry by guards and may not refuse. If it is discovered that prohibited goods are being carried out of the territory, they will be confiscated and forfeited to the government.  Prevent companies and firms from raising the selling prices of goods they sell. If such a situation occurs, people of any nationality may directly report and inform the authorities. Minor offenses will result in fines, and serious offenses will result in the revocation of business licenses.

### Coal Ball Supply Gradually Smooths

The supply of coal balls in this city has gradually become smoother. It is reported that small coal ball factories have also begun to receive their allocated coal dust and have started manufacturing and shipping. The quantity of coal balls supplied by large factories to various firewood and charcoal shops is more than before, so the retail situation has greatly improved. As for the retail departments of Yi Tai Xing and others, they are still suspending sales, but the coal balls distributed to various dealers are still supplied as usual.

Chen Yunshang, a woman from Ningbo, 22 years old, and formerly a singer at the Xin Xin Guide Society, was arrested by detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station at Room 110 of the Oriental Hotel at 184 Zhejiang Road a few days ago on suspicion of theft. Upon investigation at the police station, it was learned that Chen had broken into the home of Chen Meizhen (also a Xin Xin guide girl) at 545 Yu Qiaqing Road on the night of the 20th of last month at 8 p.m., stealing a box of clothes worth 1,000 yuan and two gold rings. The owner of the stolen goods was notified and is awaiting verification and handling.

### Cathay Bookstore Opens Reading Room

Recently, there have been many readers.

### Kunqu Actress Jin Suwen to Marry Today at 4 p.m. at the American Church on Beidang Road

Jin Suwen, known as "Second Miss," since becoming engaged to Hu Tiwei, there have been more than three rumors of their secret marriage. This shows people's special concern for the actions of artists, especially the issue of their "lifelong events." However, these rumors have all been disproven, and when friends on both sides inquired about it, they were evasive, as if there was an unspeakable secret. Thus, the more secretive, the more rumors, and the more rumors, the more secretive. As of this writing, the news of their marriage is still being kept secret, even though when this text reaches the readers, it will be their auspicious day.

Today is "Children's Day," not "April Fool's Day," so what is published in this article is not a "rumor," but a "fact."

Their wedding ceremony is very simple, which is actually due to keeping it a secret. It is said that even their closest friends may not know the location and time of their wedding until this morning. The publication of this article may cause those who care about them to become uninvited guests and create a grand spectacle of "thousands of people watching Second Miss" during the "three bows," even stepping on the bride's foot. Hu Tiwei is asked to forgive this; it is not the reporter's intentional "leak of secrets," but news from the "Hehefang spy."

Readers, if you want to participate in this wedding ceremony, please listen to my instructions.

It is still impossible to find out when the groom Hu Tiwei will arrive at Hehefang. However, according to their scheduled wedding sequence, the groom should first go to the bride's residence in the Kun family to greet the bride today. There is no ceremony for the "bride greeting." It's just that at 12 noon, the bride and groom will enter the Wan's Photo Studio on the third floor from the back door of Hehefang, and the third brother Chao Chen will preside over taking wedding photos.

The destination after taking the photos is uncertain. Perhaps this text will cause them to change their original plan. However, saying "I Will" in front of the pastor at the American Church on Beidang Road at 4 p.m. will definitely not change. Beidang Road is indeed a bit far, but the No. 22 bus can take you directly there, and it is even more convenient to have a bicycle.

After the wedding, they will return to the Luoman Hotel on Luban Road to entertain relatives and friends. It is said to be tea and snacks, which is related to the new couple's economic situation, so that the last item on the program, "entering the bridal chamber," can be implemented earlier.

The "bridal chamber night" is on Xuehuali Road. Regarding this point, I hope that those who care about them but do not know them will not linger in front of the Lujiabang Police Station. Private residences are not like photo studios, churches, and hotels; the host is not welcome. (Tai Xu)

### Liu Kuizhong's Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition

### Social Services

### US Dollar Market Continues to Strengthen

Since the statement that the virtual gold standard and customs gold units are equivalent to US dollars, the demand for US dollars has been particularly strong in recent days. Although the border was closed yesterday, some sellers would not sell for less than 28 yuan. The strength of the market has nearly doubled compared to the recent low price. Although it is far above the reasonable price, the market trend is pointing in that direction, and it is difficult to decline for the time being.

### Tobacco and Paper Shops - Become Wealthy Overnight

Recently, only soap, matches, candles, and cigarettes have seen their original prices already high, and then they have been frantically inflated. Tobacco and paper shop owners with a little status have become very wealthy. Among them, there are several giants whose wealth has reached tens of millions of yuan. Therefore, newly opened tobacco and paper shops are capitalized at 5 million yuan, even if they are partnerships. In the past, tobacco and paper shops were known as "husband and wife apprentice shops," but now they are "small holes producing big crabs" and "low-end businesses having top-end profits." This is not surprising in today's world.

### Soap's Arrogance Slightly挫折, Matches Require Queuing to Buy

The selling price of daily necessities such as soap cannot rise because general speculative merchants blindly pull up the price too hard, resulting in a strict ban on exports. Speculators have suffered a serious blow, and with the proliferation of miscellaneous brands of soap, users have mostly switched to buying them. The market outlook will inevitably continue to fall. Yesterday's selling prices, such as Guben soap at 355 yuan per case, Baixiangmao soap at 320 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap at 305 yuan, and Scissor soap at 310 yuan, were extremely sluggish.

The match market is actually selling poorly, making it difficult to rise. Merchants in other regions cannot make a profit from selling them in rural areas due to the high declared prices, and the danger of smuggling has caused buyers to stop. Therefore, prices have weakened. The opening price is 7,100 yuan for the Meili brand, 6,800 yuan for the Phoenix brand, and 5,700-5,800 yuan for miscellaneous brands. Military rations are limited to retail sales, with each ten small boxes costing 0.5 military tickets, equivalent to 4 yuan in national currency. Most of them have been sold out in the concessions, and there are more shops selling them in Hongkou and Nanshi. It is said that they require queuing, but they are more than half the price of miscellaneous brands on the market.

### Firewood Demand is Stronger - All Because Coal Balls are Inferior

Firewood: Firewood has not arrived in Shanghai for a long time. Residents use firewood to start fires because coal balls are not easy to burn. Therefore, the local demand is particularly strong, and the pine firewood stored by various households is slightly released, selling for 24-25 yuan per load. Miscellaneous firewood transported from the interior is sold for about 20 yuan per load, resulting in pine firewood selling for 2 yuan per large bundle and 1.5 yuan per small bundle at various coal and firewood shops. The retail price of scattered firewood sold by vendors along the road, which could be purchased for 3.5 jin per yuan last month, is now only 2.5 jin per yuan due to the relationship between new and old banknotes. General unscrupulous merchants secretly seek profit by secretly adding 30-40% to the prices of all their stored goods.

Charcoal: Charcoal has also not arrived in Shanghai for a long time, and with the government control and inconvenience of transportation, there is no official market. The charcoal sold in various firewood and charcoal shops is mostly locally produced goods transported from nearby kilns. However, the selling price is very high, with large baskets of about 30 jin selling for 25-28 yuan each, while small baskets are completely unavailable. The retail price at the door is 1.4-1.5 yuan per jin.

### Automobile King - Ford's Success Story

— New Film

— To be filmed by MGM —

When Ford is mentioned, everyone knows that he is the American automobile king. He also came from a poor background and went through considerable struggle to make his automobile business successful and be called the automobile king. According to news from Hollywood on April 1st, MGM Film Company plans to adapt Ford's success story into a story and put it on the screen. This matter has been agreed to by Ford himself, and filming is expected to begin soon.

In recent years, Hollywood film companies have adapted the stories of great American inventors and entrepreneurs into films several times. "Young Edison" and "Great Edison" are examples. When Ford's film is made in the future, it will certainly cause a sensation. Ford Motor Company is one of the three major automobile factories in the United States. Ford cars are sold all over the world, so the current Ford is not only a leader in the American automobile industry, but also a leader in the world automobile industry.

Such a successful person, his life's struggle, adapted into a film, is not only stimulating, but also contains educational significance. Currently, Ford is very old. Whether Ford himself can appear on the screen to explain the law when MGM films Ford in the future, the outside world has not yet found out. As for the selection of the protagonist, it has not yet been decided. In short, this new film can be started at the latest in the summer, which is undoubtedly.

### How I Wrote "When I Return"

— Xiao Lin

I wrote "When I Return" when "Intimate Confidante" was being performed. Moreover, this script was also attempted under the urging of friends. One day, I went to Miss Sun Jinglu's house for a chat, and she said that she was immediately leaving the screen and returning to the stage, and had already made an agreement with China Travel to rejoin. We were all very happy because Sun Jinglu's achievements on the stage were quite extraordinary. With hard work, the future is unlimited, so I calculated to write a script specifically for Sun Jinglu. I talked about several stories, but none of them were ideal. Finally, she took out a treasured script, which was the repentance work "Stella" by the great German poet Goethe. I read it privately at the time and felt that the script was not only full of poetry, but also the temperament of the heroine in the script was very suitable for Sun Jinglu's performance style, so I decided to write a script suitable for Chinese audiences based on this famous work.

"When I Return" was produced under this circumstance. I was very worried that I would lose most of the beautiful style of the original work, but in order to be more easily accepted by a large audience, I had to write it slightly more popular.

In addition to Sun Jinglu playing Ling Dai in the play "When I Return", Miss Di Fan also plays Yun Ping - Miss Di Fan recently starred in Yang Guifei at the Carlton, and had an excellent performance. This time, she will be able to complement Miss Sun, and Tang Huaiqiu's Bai Fanghe and Gu Han's Meilan are also rare lineups.

When it comes to writing scripts, I am just a toddler learning to walk, and I earnestly look forward to guidance and pointers.

### Lew Ayres Opposes War

— Starring Films Banned —

American actor Lew Ayres (former husband of Ginger Rogers) once starred in the anti-war film "All Quiet on the Western Front" and still opposes war. This Tuesday, he even entered the "Camp of Conscientious Objectors," causing a great stir. Therefore, 150 movie theaters in Canada that were showing films starring Lew Ayres have now been ordered to stop showing them. American movie audiences also have a unified trend of refusing to watch Lew Ayres' films.

### Audience Survey

— Vera

Dr. Gallup, the founder of well-known American public opinion surveys, conducted a survey of movie audiences last year. He specifically established a "Audience Research Institute" and conducted 194 surveys. As a result, he exposed the exaggerated words of Hollywood producers. The following are some interesting results after the survey.

According to Hollywood, 80 million viewers go to the cinema every week, which is an exaggeration. In reality, the average is only 54,275,000!

On average, 11.5 million viewers go to their favorite cinemas on Sunday holidays, but at the same time, there are 34 million people listening to Jack Benny's radio broadcasts.

On Mondays, only 5,428,000 people go to see movies, but at the same time, 26 million people listen to the special program "Lux Soap Company Air Theater" at home.

Hollywood insists that 75% of the audience is female, which is still incorrect. 51% is the true ratio. However, it also depends on the nature of the film. For example, in the case of the film "Rebecca", 70% of the audience is female. In the case of the film "Arizona", 75% of the audience is male. There are more men who go to see movies alone than women.

Female audiences do not like to watch comedies.

The audience's interest in watching movies is gradually decreasing. The reason: because of marriage and having children, they spend more time at home. The 10-year-old youth likes to watch movies the most. The theater sells 2.08 million tickets to audiences of that age every week.

Most movie audiences do not think that movie stars' salaries are too high.

Spencer Tracy is the best-selling star in the United States. Male and female audiences of all ages also love the other thirteen stars, all of whom are male. The reason is that male audiences like to watch fighting and action movies, which are of course starring male stars. As for female audiences, they like both male and female stars among the fourteen stars they like, but in general, women always like to watch movies starring female stars. Generally speaking, most audiences like to watch movies starring stars of the same sex and age as them.

Entertainment Gossip

### The Great Nuo Ceremony

— Ze Fu

In ancient times, there was always a Great Nuo ceremony on New Year's Eve. "Nuo" shares pronunciation with "difficulty," which is appropriate. Nominally, it was to drive away ghosts, but in reality, it contained the meaning of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new. Initially, it was limited to the imperial palace, but later it gradually spread to counties and prefectures. Even today, it is still widely practiced in remote areas. According to the "Treatise on Rituals" in the Book of the Later Han, this ceremony was performed in the early hours of New Year's Eve. First, 120 young children, aged ten to twelve, were selected, each holding a rattle drum. There were also twelve gods and twelve beasts (seemingly representing the twelve months), all disguised by palace women; the gods held spears and shields, while the beasts wore masks and furry costumes. During the ritual, there were always songs, such as "Tear apart her body, pull apart her trunk, dismember her flesh, extract her liver and intestines. If you do not leave quickly, the latecomers will become our food," and so on. (女 "nü" is the same as 汝 "rǔ," referring to evil ghosts.) At that time, the young children shook their drums and shouted, while the gods and beasts danced with each other. After this was done three times, they carried torches and sent them out of the palace, then knights would escort them and throw them into the water. Additionally, two gods, Shen Tu and Yu Lei, and peach wood figures and ropes were placed on the gate, and the ceremony was then completed. According to legend, Shen Tu and Yu Lei lived under a large peach tree on Mount Dushuo in the East Sea, and were in charge of all ghosts; when they encountered evil ghosts, they would seize them with ropes and use them as food for tigers, so the ritual imitated this, to show that the evil would not return. Today, common people often paste images of these two gods on their doors during the New Year, which is a remnant of this ancient custom.

### On Chen Zhengyan and Guan Zhengming

— Yan Qing

Chen Zhengyan and Guan Zhengming are both top students from the drama school. It is no easy feat to cultivate such talent in just a few short years. I have seen both of them perform many times. Because of their rare talent, I am writing this article to record my thoughts.

Chen Zhengyan specializes in old male roles, especially singing roles. His voice is slightly better, so in plays like "The Second Visit to the Palace," "Entrusting Dreams with a Stele," and "Mother Meng Teaches Her Son," he can attract an audience. I would not dare to call it excellent, but I feel that it is still worth listening to. In "The Second Visit to the Palace," the "While I was repairing the documents in the court room" segment of the Erhuang Yaoban aria is most intriguing. The "Thousand-year-old Lord" segment of the slow tempo is quite good, but later in the original tempo, his voice loses its flexibility, so the brilliance is immediately lost. As for the play "Bumping the Stele," in recent times, actors have regarded it as a daunting task, but this student dares to attempt it, showing no small amount of courage. After listening to it, the result is not bad. The decision to take a second glance in "Entrusting Dreams" passes by uneventfully. The "Golden Sands Beach" segment of "Bumping the Stele" is sung soaring into the clouds, without the slightest strain. How can one be overly critical of a young actor with such ability?

Guan Zhengming also specializes in old male roles, but unfortunately, his voice is thin and cannot be broadened. However, his delivery of lines is much better than Chen Zhengyan's. His appearance is both refined, and his stage presence is unconstrained and not clichéd. The plays "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "The Loss of the Empty City and Beheading Ma Su" can be called excellent works. Someone has already commented on "Visiting His Mother," so I will not repeat it. In the "The Loss of the Empty City and Beheading Ma Su," the original tempo of the "Two countries clash" segment fully reveals Kongming's sincerity at the time. Later, his duet with Sima Yi (played by Zhou Zhengli) in the "I was originally" and "Watching the Mountain Scenery" segments is pure, elegant, and secluded, causing Sima Yi to retreat without a fight. However, the pitch is too low, which is a bit of a pity. Considering that old male role talent is almost completely depleted at this time, finding an authentic one is already as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. And many like to act cleverly, showing their tricks as ability. Someone like these two students, who can not only恪守規矩 stick to the rules, but also diligently learn, their future achievements are guaranteed.

### Sharing Weal and Woe

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

Wei Cheng was silent and taciturn today. He said again, "I really don't understand, doing nothing, I just ended up becoming a person, and on top of that, I went and read some books." He had said these words before, and now he repeated them to emphasize his point. He then continued, "If I weren't human, but an animal, or even if I were a person, but ignorant and uneducated, never having read a book, that would be easier. Uncle, aunt, aunt, you talk about your things, I'm going to see my mother. Even though my mother is dead, I still think of her as if she hadn't died." He sobbed, stood up, pushed the door open and ran out. Second Mrs. Ye shouted behind him, "Wei Cheng, stay further away, there's an unclean air around someone who has passed away, you need to take care of your body, don't run, be careful of slipping. Your aunt is here." She shook Great Aunt's shoulders, wanting Great Aunt to take care of Wei Cheng. Great Aunt went.

Li Youxie turned his palms upwards and shrugged his hands, saying, "He is a filial son, this matter cannot be done." Second Mrs. Ye said, "He doesn't even want to hear about marrying Cui Zhen as his wife, other things are even more unnecessary. Uncle, we should still take care of eldest sister-in-law's funeral, and wait until the mourning period is over before talking. Anyway, wearing mourning clothes doesn't mean wearing them for a full three years, twenty-seven months will pass by in the blink of an eye, and it can't be helped if the family is a bit desolate." Li Youxie said, "If he doesn't want to, then we can't very well refuse him."

Second Mrs. Ye and Li Youxie came out of the Shuangmei Study, still busy with the funeral arrangements. They called He Zixing to the Wei family to inform Qin Runzhi that the matter they had just discussed would be dropped. At the same time, they sent out obituary notices one by one. The people from the funerary shop also arrived, and immediately erected a frame made of white cloth strips, and hung flower balls made of white cloth strips. The words "Shide Hall" were also covered with white paper. Li Youxie took some time to walk into the room of Eldest Mrs. Ye. The other female relatives had stopped wailing, but only Cui Zhen was still sobbing softly. Li Youxie thought of the sister-brother feelings from childhood, and involuntarily cried from inside the room to outside. (41)

### The Success Stories of the Four Great Movie Stars

— Jing Yi

(4) Gu Lanjun

When Gu Lanjun was in the Mingxing Film Company in her early years, she was called a "yellow-haired girl" because she entered the film industry at the age of fifteen. However, for several years, she was never valued by the higher-ups, and she remained in supporting roles. In Hu Die's "Sister Flowers," she still played an unimportant role. It was not until Xu Xinfu married her elder sister, Meijun, that Xu Xinfu vigorously promoted her. When filming the first detective film, "The Jade Horse," he assigned her the female lead. However, in reality, she was still not highly regarded. Later, when Xu Xinfu was hired to join Xinhua, she followed him and her sister Meijun to join as well. At that time, costume dramas had not yet been discovered, and Xinhua mobilized huge capital to produce "Diao Chan," which was enthusiastically welcomed by the audience. From then on, costume dramas became popular for a time, and various companies competed to film them. Gu Lanjun's rise to prominence can also be said to have started with "Diao Chan." Later, she starred in "Wu Zetian," "Pan Jinlian," and others. Her acting skills were so superb that she almost replaced the film queen Hu Die, who had already gone to Hong Kong at the time. She was most skilled at playing shrewish roles, and she also had a foundation in martial arts. This was because Xu Xinfu had previously specialized in shooting martial arts films. The year before last, Xu Xinfu founded the Fuhua Film Company himself, and he invited her and Li Ying, a young actor who was not very eye-catching at the time, to star in "Huang Tianba." The two unexpectedly fell into a whirlpool of love while acting, and soon got married. After marriage, they founded the Guanghua Film Company themselves. The first film was "Fated Flower." At that time, costume dramas were causing a smoky mess. When "Fated Flower" was released, the audience was refreshed, and it caused another sensation. The currently showing "The Fallen Woman" is their fourth collaboration.

### Tibetan Opera

— Ze

Tibetans call performing opera "Lhamo Che," and there are also distinctions between major and minor operas. Major operas are performed by lamas, and the equipment is all inherent to the lama temple. Every August, they are often held in the open space near the temple. No stage is built; only rope posts are used to create a circular space, like a circus ring. A poplar tree is inserted in the middle, and a short table is set up under it to worship the god of the opera, namely, Laozi. The dressing area is set up outside the ring. When performing, cannons must first be fired and lions danced, followed by auspicious short plays such as "Immortal Deer Presenting Longevity" and "Longevity Star Offering Wine," before the main play begins. The plot focuses on education and enlightenment, and is mostly based on history or novels. For example, "The Black Hat Dance" tells the story of the Tibetan King Langdarma being assassinated by a dancer; "Princess Wencheng" tells the story of Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty marrying the Tubo King Songtsen Gampo; "The Jealous Ghost Story" tells the story of the chief's wife being jealous of the chief marrying a fairy. However, in addition to the singing and dialogue, each scene has a separate explanation, which is read aloud by a lama standing in the middle of the ring. The musical instruments include drums, cymbals, and trumpets, and the players are all seated at the edge of the ring. There are also sets, with several scenes set up in the same ring, so there is no need to change them during the performance. As for minor operas, they are performed by lay people. They have their own troupes, which travel around and are hired by people. The performances are mostly songs, dances, and comedies, focusing on entertaining people, unlike major operas, which have a religious color. Therefore, when wealthy families hold banquets, they often invite them to add to the entertainment.
