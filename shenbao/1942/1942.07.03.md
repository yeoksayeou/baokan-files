### Japan's Government Bond Total for the First Half of the Year: 6.5 Billion Yen

United Press dispatch from Tokyo, dated 2nd: According to today's disclosure, as a result of the effective cooperation of financiers and the public with the Japanese government's government bond policy since the outbreak of the East Asia War, the government bond absorption rate for the first half of the year reached 99.3%, with a total issuance of 6,512,000,000 yen. The same period last year was 97.2%. The absorption rate for the three months from April to June reached 96%, compared to 95% in the same quarter last year, totaling 3,391,000,000 yen, with a total issuance of 3,530,000,000 yen.

### Termination of German-American Repatriation Agreement; Swedish Vessel Refused Safe Passage Guarantee

United Press dispatch from Washington, dated 1st: The State Department has announced that the Swedish vessel "Gripsholm," which has recently been sailing between New York and Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, transporting nationals of belligerent countries to their homelands, had previously received a guarantee of safe passage from the German government. However, the German government has now refused to continue to guarantee its safety. The U.S. government, therefore, considers the mutual repatriation agreement to be invalid and has requested that the Swedish government inform Germany of this decision. According to a State Department spokesperson, the German government believes it can no longer guarantee the safe passage of ships through the Atlantic coastal area and has therefore withdrawn its guarantee. According to the German-American agreement, the ship would continue to sail until all enemy nationals in both countries had been completely repatriated. In its first two round trips, it carried back 1,443 Americans and 390 nationals from South American countries.

Reuters dispatch from Lisbon, dated 2nd: The U.S. State Department announced yesterday that the U.S. government has informed the German government through the Swiss government that the U.S. government considers the German-American repatriation agreement to be terminated. Since the German government is unwilling to allow the Swedish mail ship "Gripsholm" to continue traveling between New York and Lisbon, the repatriation agreement naturally ceases to be effective.

### Axis Nationals in Colombia Evacuated to the Interior

Reuters dispatch from Buenos Aires, dated 2nd: A report from the capital of Colombia states that the head of the foreign affairs section of the Colombian police has announced that the authorities have ordered Axis nationals residing within Colombia to evacuate to locations at least 100 kilometers from the border. The government currently has no intention of detaining Axis nationals, but Axis nationals employed in commercial firms will be dismissed and replaced by Colombians.

### New Air Force Commander in Hawaii, General Hall, Issues Statement

United Press dispatch from Lisbon, dated 1st: According to an Associated Press report from Hawaii, Major General Hall, the successor to Major General Raine Carter, commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces in Hawaii, who died in the Battle of Midway, arrived on the 30th night. In a meeting with reporters, he stated, "We must realize that this is a long and arduous period. We should stop all disputes among the military and implement joint cooperation."

Zhou Huarén is specially appointed as a member of the Economic Commission.

### Debate on the North African Situation in the British House of Lords and Commons

Havas dispatch from London, dated 1st: The British House of Commons began debating the Libyan campaign today. Sir Milner, a Conservative MP, spoke first, criticizing Prime Minister Churchill for also holding the post of Minister of Defence. He said, "The Ministry of Defence should be entrusted to someone who has sufficient time and sufficient power to command the Navy, Army, and Air Force. In other words, the Minister of Defence must have the power to obtain the military equipment necessary for victory and thereby ensure that the commanders of the Navy, Army, and Air Force are not hindered in their work. Anyone who has a higher political standing than a military position should not interfere in military affairs unless there are military reasons. The Duke of Gloucester should be appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Army, and Air Force (causing laughter). As for the campaign in Burma, the government conceals its failure and engages in meaningless propaganda. We must recognize defeat as the most terrible calamity. Therefore, I firmly advocate that an immediate investigation be conducted to ascertain the truth so that we can understand why we have repeatedly been too late and why our war plans have ultimately failed. We have been engaged in warfare for over two years. We can no longer say, 'We were unable to be proactive and were therefore at a disadvantage everywhere because we were not adequately prepared.' If the Soviet Union had not entered the war, what would be the situation in our country today? Only God knows. Prime Minister Churchill has given numerous optimistic speeches, but the facts are otherwise. Therefore, every time we hear him speak of success, we must not only ask what kind of victory Britain has achieved, but even more so what kind of new disaster Britain should prepare to face. Regarding the issue of tanks, the Minister of Supply has been changed three times in three years, and each successive Minister of Supply has replaced the personnel responsible for manufacturing tanks, and none of these personnel have any experience. Although the 'Churchill tank' is a powerful weapon, it is completely obsolete. The tanks used by our army in the recent Libyan campaign were those used in the Spanish Civil War. Secondly, although there are better aircraft deployed to Libya, especially the 'Beaufighter,' the number is very small. In each operation, we are outnumbered, almost three to one. I have no confidence in those who command the front-line battles from London, but I know that in the current war, the whole country has a great determination to win. If we want to win, we must make major changes. The first demand of our public opinion is to understand whether the surrender of our troops at Tobruk was decided on the front lines or in London or Washington. This should be immediately communicated to the press. For example, after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States immediately sent personnel to investigate. In our style, after the defeat in Libya, an optimistic speech is given instead. In the future, will the House of Commons faithfully listen to the government's false reports, remain silent and not utter a word, or will it decide to take all necessary measures to reverse the situation? Decisive action, now is the time."

Havas dispatch from London, dated 1st: In the House of Commons debate on the Libyan campaign today, Conservative MP Keyes spoke after Milner, severely criticizing the Prime Minister's naval advisors, saying, "In the first two years of the current war, Prime Minister Churchill strongly advocated launching an offensive in North Africa, believing that an attack by the Army and Navy would have a significant impact on the current war. This plan had the consent of the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, but it was delayed and could not be implemented. As a result, the North African campaign was still preempted by the German army, creating a situation in which Prime Minister Churchill believed that it would be difficult to engage in battle without strong reinforcements. Therefore, although well-trained troops were always eager to go to the front line to fight, they followed the advice of naval advisors, disregarding the opposition of the General Staff, and remained inactive for months, which was extremely unwise. Therefore, the personnel of the Admiralty should be replaced, because this move has been delayed for too long, and the Admiralty has also made a mistake in not sending troops to reinforce the British Mediterranean Fleet sooner. Prime Minister Churchill remaining the leader of the government is the most important issue for our country, but in his governance, he should form a truly united national cabinet, and should not recruit some compromising politicians, and should organize a committee." Then, Littleton, Under-Secretary of State for Production, responded on behalf of the government, saying that the words of Milner and Keyes were contradictory. The former requested the Prime Minister to resign from the post of Minister of Defence, while the latter asked him to take urgent measures regarding matters related to leading the war. Regarding the tank issue, the Ministry of Defence is currently manufacturing new weapons to counter tanks, and a large number of powerful weapons will soon be transported to various fronts for application. The U.S. heavy tanks are of excellent quality and are comparable to the best German tanks. The United States is currently producing them in large quantities. General Auchinleck has several of these heavy tanks under his command. Other types of tanks are also arriving in a steady stream, several every day. We are sparing no effort in manufacturing tanks, and the government attaches great importance to the Air Force, especially the construction of dive bombers. In June 1940, we ordered such aircraft from the United States. It should be known that on the whole we have gained superiority, and we should not limit ourselves to one front. In the future, we will also use dive bombers in naval battles. In addition to some that have already been transported to the front lines, there are still some on their way from the United States to Europe. According to the opinion of our military officers, the Axis countries have dive bombers and can influence the development of the North African campaign. The initial objective of our current strategy is to protect the Suez Canal, the oil fields of Iran and Iraq, and the people of friendly countries in the Near East. The greatest achievement of the enemy is that they have occupied air bases near our bases. Fortunately, our army is holding important positions and is determined not to retreat, and our domestic manufacturing of tanks and aircraft is increasing day by day. At this point, independent MP Davies took the floor and requested that the House of Commons stop the debate and not let public opinion know the "details of our failure," but advocated investigating the responsible personnel. At this point, Labour MP Greenwood also said that he could not consider Littleton's reply satisfactory, because he still failed to provide a detailed report on the Libyan campaign. If the government cannot explain everything to the House of Commons within the next ten days, it will inevitably face danger.

Havas dispatch from London, dated 1st: In the House of Commons debate on the Libyan campaign today, Conservative MP James also spoke, attacking the former Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, saying, "Some may ask whether Lord Beaverbrook is a member of the Fifth Column. In my impression, some of our leaders seem to believe that they can win by merely using intimidation. The government uses the bombing of Germany as propaganda material for the people, but they do not know that the result is merely weakening the strength of our air force, preventing our country from having sufficient aircraft to patrol the sea and protect our merchant ships from submarine attacks." Another Conservative MP, Major Hinchingbrooke, then spoke, defending Lieutenant-General Ritchie, the former commander of the Eighth Army, strongly arguing, "We should not summarily dismiss important generals after each defeat. If General Rommel had been dismissed after his defeat in North Africa last year, we would not have been defeated this time. Therefore, it is not appropriate to make unwarranted criticisms after each defeat."

Tense Atmosphere in the House of Lords

Havas dispatch from London, dated 1st:

The House of Lords met in a tense atmosphere today to debate the war situation. Lord Cranborne spoke first, explaining the importance of the Malta campaign, saying, "The heroic spirit of resistance of the defenders of Malta will be immortalized. The British Army and Maltese troops have endured all the hardships of war for years. Without Malta, our position in North Africa could not have been maintained for so long. However, it is essential to use our most elite air force to defend the island. We had to weaken our defenses in the Middle East in the past in order to hold the island and had to constantly replenish its losses. The commander of our Air Force has never allowed the island's defenders to lose air cover, even during the fierce fighting in Libya, which is commendable." Lord Beaverbrook, the former Minister of Aircraft Production, spoke next, defending national defense production, saying, "I do not believe that the British Army in Libya has fewer tanks than the German and Italian forces. I have never heard anyone say that there is a shortage of aircraft on the North African front. Our aircraft manufacturing rate has greatly improved, but there is still a shortage of supply. As for tank defense weapons, they are also being rushed. The 77mm anti-tank gun has already been used on the Libyan front. If it has not been used, then a public investigation should be conducted. I dare to say that in the Libyan campaign, our army has more tanks than the total number of tanks of the German and Italian forces. Anyone who is familiar with desert warfare can know this. British heavy tanks are faster than German tanks of the same type, but German medium tanks are faster than British 'Matilda' and 'Valentine' tanks, so there is no difference in the strength of the two armies' tanks. A 22-ton heavy tank is currently being manufactured, and smaller tanks firing six-pound shells are also being rushed, but I am sorry that I cannot provide details to avoid alerting the enemy. Regarding the Libyan campaign, there is limited information available and one should not hastily blame the generals commanding the operation. General Auchinleck, the commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Middle East, is a resolute and responsible military man. It is not surprising that he personally led the Eighth Army, because he would never delegate the responsibility for the retreat and the defense work after the fall of Tobruk to others. The abandonment of Tobruk was not decided by Prime Minister Churchill. I know the Prime Minister's personality well, so I expect that he must have notified the responsible generals, telling them to decide everything for themselves. Various parties are blaming the Prime Minister for the defeat in Libya and demanding that he resign from the position of Minister of Defence. I am strongly opposed to this, because insisting on this point will lead to various debates, wasting time and harming the situation further." Lord Addison spoke immediately afterwards, still requesting that Churchill resign from the position of Minister of Defence, saying, "It would be a better policy for Prime Minister Churchill to effectively consult the Cabinet and the Ministry of Defence and to appoint General Wavell as the Minister of Defence. Regarding the Libyan incident, it has shocked Britain and the rest of the world. Everyone is outraged by this incredible defeat. It is incomprehensible why the British Army did not carry out a large-scale bombing. If the bombing of Cologne in Germany was imitated and carried out in Libya, Benghazi would have been reduced to rubble long ago, and the Axis forces would have lost their non-supply base." After the speech, the House of Lords adjourned.

### U.S. Aircraft Carrier "Wasp" Sunk in the Mediterranean; Panamanian and Brazilian Merchant Ships Sunk

Reuters dispatch from Lisbon, dated 2nd: According to a U.S. radio station, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp" was sunk by Axis aircraft while transporting British fighter planes to Malta. This is the first time a U.S. aircraft carrier has been sunk in Europe. The ship was launched in 1940, with a displacement of 14,800 tons and could carry 50 aircraft.

Havas dispatch from Washington, dated 1st: The Navy Department has announced that a small Panamanian freighter was torpedoed and sunk off the east coast of the United States. The rescued sailors have landed in a certain port. In addition, a U.S. merchant ship of ordinary tonnage was torpedoed and sunk off the north coast of South America. The sailors have also landed in an eastern port.

Havas dispatch from Cape Town, South Africa, dated 1st:

The Panamanian sailing ship "Nova Scotia" departed from the United States on the second of last month to come here. It was suddenly sunk by an Italian submarine en route. Eleven rescued sailors drifted at sea in a lifeboat for six days before arriving here today.

Havas dispatch from Rio de Janeiro, dated 1st:

Evening newspapers reported that a Brazilian merchant ship, which had been lingering in the high seas for seven months, had been attacked by submarines several times, and after enduring various dangers, finally broke through the blockade and arrived in New York Harbor today. However, the newspapers did not announce the ship's name.

United Press dispatch from Berlin, dated 1st: German submarines sank fourteen ships in the Atlantic and along the coasts of North and South America between the 28th and 29th, totaling 98,000 tons. In June, German submarines sank a total of 892,700 tons, far exceeding last year's highest record of 746,000 tons. Their operational area is more extensive than before the United States entered the war, so more ships have been sunk than last year. This implies that the number of German submarines has increased and their operations have become more skillful. The British have boasted that they sink ten German submarines every month. Even if this claim becomes a reality, if Germany's submarine building capacity is as rumored in the first year of the war, it can produce 30 ships per month, then it can increase by 200 ships per year. The United States has also boasted that it can build 800,000 tons of ships per month, but the total tonnage of U.S. ships sunk by the Axis countries has exceeded one million tons, so the United States' current shipbuilding capacity is not enough to compensate for its losses. As the days are longer after this, it is a good time for submarine activity, and the number of German submarines will increase even more. By winter, the German submarine inventory will be even larger, and the number of ships sunk will increase even more. By the end of next year, the British and Americans will face a dire situation, because they will not be able to fight due to a lack of ships.

### U.S. Establishes Naval Base in Ulster

Reuters dispatch from Lisbon, dated 2nd: An Ulster official declared yesterday that the United States has established a naval base in Ulster, Northern Ireland. U.S. Navy Commander Lawson declared that Ulster is larger than any base the United States acquired in Europe during the last war.

### Guerrilla Warfare in the Balkans

Havas dispatch from Rome, dated 1st: An Italian newspaper published an article, revealing the situation of guerrilla warfare in the Balkans, saying, "Why are there so many Italian troops in the Balkans? To understand this, one must first know that the occupation of Yugoslavia was the result of a blitzkrieg. Our army only advanced along the main roads, and small groups of troops still resisted in the interior. The people of the Balkans have been influenced by Pan-Slavism for centuries and are willing to be tools of the Soviet Union, resisting us. This resistance is purely guerrilla warfare in nature. The enemy troops appear and disappear unpredictably, and it is not appropriate for our army to deal with them with regular troops. Guerrilla tactics must be countered with guerrilla tactics. The people in the occupied areas of Yugoslavia must choose between being pro-Italian or anti-Italian, and must not be ambiguous. We must also cooperate to eliminate the guerrillas. The various terrorist activities in Croatia are instigated by Britain behind the scenes. We must not relax. The battle in Croatia is part of the war against the British Empire. Our country is in a very difficult situation and must fight on both the sea and land fronts. Our country must send troops to the military strategic centers along the Adriatic coast and must expand the area of occupied inland guerrilla warfare."

### Two German Planes Fly Over Sweden

Havas dispatch from Stockholm, dated 2nd: Two German planes flew over southern Sweden yesterday morning. After Swedish anti-aircraft guns opened fire, they changed their flight path.

### Volcano Erupts on Sicily

Havas dispatch from Catania, Sicily, dated 1st: Mount Etna suddenly erupted again today, fortunately the tremor was not severe.

### De Valera Denies Holding General Election

Havas dispatch from Dublin, dated 1st: Eamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, stated last night that the rumors that Ireland will hold a general election this year are not true. If the opposition parties agree, the current government will maintain the status quo and continue to serve for two years.

### Wife of a French Prisoner Shot and Wounded

Reuters dispatch from Paris, dated 2nd: The wife of a French prisoner was shot and wounded by two people in her home. According to the investigation, the case has political undertones.

### Ten · Kingdom of the Desert (II) The Complete Picture of Saudi Arabia

The nomads of Arabia have another name; they are called Bedouins. Literally translated, it means "people of the plains." These are people who move along the coast in areas with water and grass. Although they have been away from their homeland for a long time, their temperament is stubborn. They never intermarry with foreign races, and their blood always maintains a purity. Because they live by following water and grass, they are also called "people of tents." They are generally strong in appearance, but with thin faces. Their skin is dyed a brownish color due to constant exposure to strong sunlight. They are all very hardworking, and generally only eat one meal a day. Due to lack of nutrition, they age quickly. Before they reach fifty years old, they already look old and haggard, with wrinkles all over their foreheads, as if they were in their seventies or eighties. They are very kind and extremely fond of their wives and daughters. They also treat strangers with politeness. Generally speaking, they are a very lovable people, but like other people who grow up in the desert, they are also fierce. Many of their descendants cannot bear the burden of life and become bandits, engaging in robbery and murder.

Geologically speaking, Saudi Arabia is composed of volcanic lava. The general terrain is very high, averaging over two thousand feet above sea level. The differences in topography between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf have led to significant differences in human culture.

If we start from the west coast, what we see before us are continuous high mountain ranges of gray-black color. In the narrow and steep valleys, we also occasionally find a rushing torrent. The fierce waves beat against the dark rocks, splashing countless bubbles. These waterways are unlikely to be of much benefit. When flash floods occur, the surroundings are filled with water, vast and mighty like an ocean. The coastline is also occasionally interspersed with grasslands, but they are desolate and bleak. If you are traveling from Shanghai to Europe, on the long sea voyage, perhaps this section of the Red Sea will give you the most desolate impression. The temperature here is above forty-five degrees Celsius all year round. When you look up, it is the scorching sun. You feel like you are in a furnace and cannot bear it. You will surely think you have traveled to hell.

From the Gulf of Aqaba down along the Hejaz Mountains, there are steep and jagged peaks, all bare without a trace of vegetation. You cannot see a single shadow of plants. In the Median region, it has not rained a drop for several years. Because of its monotonous and strange appearance, some clever people speculate that there must be extremely rich treasures in this area. Beneath the solidified volcanic lava, people think that perhaps large amounts of granite and calcium are buried! But speculation is always just speculation. No one has been able to prove what is actually buried inside. People can only compare it to the Atacama Desert and constantly curse it.

Further south, we arrive at Tedama. Geographically, it maintains a consistent connection with the north, still a desert, still desolate. Plants like clover and mimosa are rarely found. The mountains here are also steep and precipitous. If you want to find any difference, the only difference is that the mountains here are yellowish-black in color, and the general terrain is slightly lower. Naturally, agriculture and animal husbandry cannot be developed here, but trade is relatively developed. In ancient times, this area was a center for barter trade. With the development of commerce, magnificent Islamic temples are everywhere, and the money spent on them each year is more than ten million.

We have taken a turn around the west, and now our footprints have reached the coast of the Persian Gulf. Here, the harbors are winding and the islands are scattered like chess pieces. In the past, it was a gathering place for pirates. Because the water is shallow, large ships cannot anchor, which gives pirates a good opportunity to wreak havoc. As far back as the nineteenth century, the pirates in this area were estimated to be no less than twenty thousand people. Their reputation was extremely high, much like the water bandits of Liangshan. In 1809, Britain saw that these pirates would cause endless harm if they were not eliminated as soon as possible, so it sent expeditionary forces to suppress them three times. Although they were eventually subdued, the cost was considerable. The war lasted for twenty years, and the pirates' firm resistance was truly astonishing.

Persian Gulf Pearl Divers

Speaking of the Persian Gulf, people will think of pearls. The reason why the Persian Gulf is famous is because of this unique treasure. The large-scale production of pearls is concentrated in Bahrain. A few years ago, a French writer, Albert Londres, wrote a report on this topic. The pearl divers of the Persian Gulf are truly the most unfortunate group of people in the world. When they are very young children, they are taken to the ocean. Here begins a fixed life from which they can never escape. Except for a very small number who go to other places to make a living, their fate has long been determined. When they are only eleven or twelve years old, they first start practicing swimming. They try to seal their noses with a pair of pliers. They practice like this. If they can hold their breath for two minutes, then their skill is up to par. They are congratulated by their companions. They need to know that it is not easy to have this ability. They naturally feel a little proud, and they become a member of the pearl divers. At first, they feel a sense of novelty when people call them pearl divers (Rhee), but after that, they start working in the sea! They slide to the bottom of the sea with their companions, and they catch pearl oysters. They do this day after day. They spend most of their time in the sea every day. They really want to never do this job again. Their previous interest has long been completely wiped out without a trace. But how to make a living? And there is that stern face of the foreman... They sigh and have to drag their exhausted bodies to continue working.

Sometimes their eyes become severely inflamed by the seawater. Sometimes, during work, they may suddenly lose consciousness. When they wake up, they have been carried to a hospital ship (Boom). They find that they have lost a leg, or their arm has been bitten off by a whale. They have become disabled, but who cares about them? Who told them they had bad luck? Not to mention becoming disabled, what if they are swallowed whole by a whale? Those black-hearted and cruel employers will not feel sorry for them. Their death is like an insect being trampled on. No one will shed a tear of sympathy.

During those long and painful days, all they can hear are the foreman's rude shouts, "Seh! Seh! (Work! Work!)" They feel like they have come to this world only to suffer. Then one day, they become old, and they finally lie down forever. Now, when we see those pearls and gems worn by elegant and luxurious women on the bustling streets of big cities, we all praise their bright luster, but who can think of the story of blood and tears hidden behind them!

### Germany Announces Capture of Sevastopol Fierce Battle Lasted 25 Days, 200,000 Casualties on Both Sides

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) A special war report released by the German High Command last night stated that the port of Sevastopol has fallen. The flags of Germany and Romania have been raised in the city, harbor, and fortress. The German-Romanian Allied forces led by General von Manstein, assisted by General von Richthofen's long-range fighter planes, captured the world's most impregnable sea and land fortress yesterday afternoon after 25 days of fierce fighting. The Axis forces closely cooperated to capture concrete bunkers, underground fortresses, and fortresses in the rocks. The number of prisoners and war booty is still difficult to estimate. The remnants of the Soviet army are retreating to the Sevastopol Peninsula, crowded into a small area, and are facing annihilation.

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) After 25 days of fierce fighting, the German army has occupied Sevastopol. The German war report first mentioned the start of the attack on Sevastopol on June 6. The city is the world's most impregnable sea and land fortress, a naval port on the Black Sea, and a commercial port in the Ukrainian industrial area, with a population of about 120,000 people. It also has aircraft factories and arsenals. The German High Command announced yesterday afternoon that the attack on the Malakhov Kurgan has made the fall of Sevastopol inevitable. According to authoritative sources here, the British and French Allied forces fought fiercely for nearly a year during the Crimean War before occupying Sevastopol, with about 80,000 casualties. The Russian army also lost 120,000 men. During the last World War, the German army, led by General von Isella, occupied the city on May 1, 1918.

Moscow, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) The General Staff of the Red Army recently released a war report stating, "The German army repeatedly attacked the Kursk front line but were repelled by our army. Fierce fighting also occurred in other areas, with heavy losses on the German side. As for the port of Sevastopol, fierce fighting is still ongoing. After the German army invaded our defensive positions, they made further progress today, and both sides are engaged in close combat and hand-to-hand fighting."

Bern, Switzerland, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) The battle for Sevastopol has lasted for 25 days. The intensity of the fighting is unprecedented. The German side increased its forces from ten divisions to fifteen divisions. During the final general offensive by the German-Romanian Allied forces, large-scale bombing was used to assist, and the intensity was something the Red Army had never experienced before. Bombing occurred ten to twelve times every day. There was almost no safe place in the port city. In the end, all the men and women in the port city were armed with rifles and hand grenades to fight to the death. The German army seemed to have broken through the defensive lines in the eastern district.

### New Offensive Launched by Germany on Central and Southern Sections of Eastern Front Tank Battles Raging in Several Areas of Kursk Front

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) Today's German war report stated that the German army has begun an offensive on the southern and central sections of the Eastern Front and has achieved initial victories. To date, 52 Soviet aircraft have been shot down.

Bern, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) The German army has launched a new offensive on the Eastern Front, moving from the Sychevka area, 112 miles from Moscow, and launching intensive attacks along the main road southwest of Moscow. News from Berlin says that the German army has achieved great victories in the southern and central sectors of the Eastern Front. Details of the German army's new offensive are unclear, but the development of the battle has clearly begun to favor the attacking forces. Further south, tank battles are raging in several areas of the Kursk front north of Kharkov. It is widely believed that the victory announced by Berlin was obtained here. The German army launched armored vehicles to attack the troops of Soviet General Timoshenko. The Soviet army resisted resolutely, but the German army still made progress. According to a supplementary communique from Moscow, the Soviet artillery on that front was heavily attacked by German bombers, followed by an infantry attack. The German army on the Kharkov front has made great progress in the past two days.

Berlin, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) Semi-official commentary has been released, emphasizing that a general offensive against the Soviet Union has begun, stating, "Today, July 1, 1942, will mark a new page in the history of World War II. The war against the Soviet Union has now entered a new stage. The clearing of the Eastern Front has ended, and our army is on standby at all points on the front line. The future direction of each battlefield can be sought in the following factors: (1) The Axis forces are advancing towards the last British stronghold in the Mediterranean; (2) Japan is advancing towards the eastern border of India and has control of the Indian Ocean; (3) Allied merchant ship tonnage losses are huge, with losses exceeding one million tons in June alone; (4) The Allied Black Sea base of Sevastopol has fallen; (5) The general offensive against the Soviet Union has already begun."

### General von Manstein Promoted to General

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Urgent Telegram) After General von Manstein, commander of the German forces in Crimea, captured Sevastopol, German Führer Hitler sent a congratulatory telegram and promoted von Manstein to General. The telegram stated, "Your Excellency has repeatedly performed outstanding service on the Crimean Peninsula, and the annihilation battle of Kerch and the capture of Sevastopol are particularly significant. I have promoted Your Excellency to General to commend the great achievements of the troops under your command."

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) Within three days, three German generals with outstanding achievements have been promoted to General by the Führer. After General Rommel, the hero of Tobruk, and General Köhler, the hero of Volkhov, were successively promoted to General, now General von Manstein, the hero of the Battle of Sevastopol, has also been promoted for his meritorious service. Manstein was the tenth son of a Prussian artillery commander, born in 1887, only four years older than Rommel, the youngest general. Coincidentally, during the Russo-Turkish Crimean War of 1768-1774, there was also a General von Manstein who conquered the Crimean Peninsula for the Russians.

### German Press Commentary

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) German newspapers published the news of the fall of Sevastopol with large headlines, calling it the first victory after the Eastern Front war. It was stated that Sevastopol was the strongest fortress in the world, and the German-Romanian Allied forces occupied it after 25 days of hard fighting, winning a complete victory. It was noted that 87 years ago, the British and French Allied forces engaged in the Crimean War and spent eleven months before Sevastopol surrendered, which further demonstrates the strength of the German-Romanian Allied forces. The "People's Observer" published a photograph of Sevastopol taken from the air, which shows the strength of its defensive works. A local Berlin newspaper stated that after the initial German-Romanian Allied forces rushed into the Crimean Peninsula, they surrounded the fortress. Later, the offensive was halted due to the severe winter, but now it has finally been captured by the heroic German-Romanian Allied forces.

### German Casualties on the Eastern Front

Führer Headquarters, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) Today it was officially announced that from June 22, 1941, to June 21, 1942, the German army's officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers who died on the Eastern Front totaled 271,612, and those missing totaled 65,730.

### The Entire Mediterranean Theater Has Changed Churchill Acknowledges the Seriousness of the Situation in the House of Commons

Bern, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) According to news from London, British Prime Minister Churchill addressed the House of Commons and acknowledged that as a result of General Rommel's "outstanding" strategy, the British forces in North Africa had been driven back to within 150 miles of their starting point for the offensive. Rommel's tanks had been reduced to seventy or eighty percent, but the German general reorganized his forces with outstanding tactics, causing the British army to suffer losses. The most critical battle is now underway in Egypt, and serious news can be received at any time. The military setback in North Africa has changed the entire Mediterranean theater. In the past two weeks, the British side has lost more than 50,000 men, most of whom were captured by the Axis forces. Although the British side tried to sabotage, a large amount of war equipment fell into the hands of the German army.

### Germany Uses Long-Barreled Cannons, Like Two-Story Buildings The Port of Sevastopol Has Become a Huge Furnace Covered in Smoke and Fire from Shipyards and Oil Pools

Berlin, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) In a newsreel of the battles around Sevastopol released by the German Propaganda Ministry yesterday, it was revealed that the German army used 60 cm giant cannons and 42 cm long-range railway cannons to bombard the Soviet fortifications defending the Black Sea naval base. The shells used by the long-range railway cannons were as long as three meters. The newsreel also showed soldiers snaking into the breech to clean them. German military authorities revealed that the use of large cannons to destroy Soviet defenses was a natural thing in this war, as 50 cm cannons had already been used in World War I.

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) It was previously learned that the German army, in order to conquer the strong defensive works of Sevastopol, used extremely heavy cannons to bombard them. The war films released recently showed these cannons. The size of the shells used was unprecedented in the last World War.

Berlin, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) Germany's latest long-barreled cannons exerted their power in the capture of Sevastopol. The height of the barrel was like a two-story building. The shells were transported from the bottom floor to the top floor by an elevator. The speed and bombardment power of the cannon made people speechless. At the same time, the news of the fall of the port was announced by the Führer's headquarters tonight. Because the daily war report had already said that it was about to fall, the general public was not surprised. This world-famous and strong fortress was finally conquered by the German-Romanian Allied forces in 25 days. The details of the final scene of the battle for the city have not yet been received, but it is known that the German air force was exceptionally active, and the bombing in the last 48 hours was particularly fierce. In the Inkerman area, the rocks were blown to pieces, and stones as large as five-story buildings fell into the Red Army trenches. The sappers are carrying out mine-clearing work, which is the most dangerous but also the most effective. At present, the port has become a huge furnace, with shipyards, oil pools, and ammunition depots all covered in smoke and fire. In short, after the fall of the port, the Red Army fleet in the Black Sea will have almost no room for activity.

### Tank Battles Raging on the Narrow Coastal Strip of Northern Egypt Germany Claims to Have Broken Through the Alamein Line

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) According to an announcement by the German army today, the German-Italian Allied forces in North Africa have broken through the British army's Alamein line and are now pursuing the defeated British army towards the Nile River basin. Axis aircraft shot down a total of nine British aircraft.

Cairo, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) According to British sources, the fighting in Egypt is now taking place 60 miles west of Alexandria. There are also tank battles west of El Alamein, which is said to be a strong British stronghold.

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) Responsible sources in London acknowledged yesterday that the British army in Egypt has retreated to a point east of El Daba. It is reported that the battle is taking place in and east of El Daba.

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) A Swedish newspaper correspondent in Britain reported that an unprecedented tank battle in North Africa is taking place between Alamein and the Qattara Depression in Egypt. The fate of Alexandria may be determined by the outcome of this battle. The terrain there is like a bottleneck, only 40 kilometers wide, and the intensity of the fighting is unprecedented. It is reported that General Auchinleck's troops have suffered heavy losses, especially in tanks. The Axis losses are also considerable. London occasionally says that the loss of Alexandria would not have a major impact because the British Navy can still use excellent ports such as Haifa. From these statements, it can be seen that London has little confidence in the tank battle that is currently underway. In general, the situation west of Alexandria is very confused, and it is expected that it will take another 24 hours before a decision can be made.

Bern, Switzerland, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) According to reports from Geneva, London hopes that the Axis offensive in Egypt will be blocked in the narrow strip of land (approximately 35 miles) between the northern Egyptian coast and the Qattara Depression. Although the Axis forces have entered this area, it is said to be rugged and difficult to pass through. However, the British are still concerned about the battle currently taking place 50 miles west of Alexandria. According to the "Basler Tagesblatt," reinforcements drawn by Britain from Syria and Palestine have arrived in Egypt, including New Zealand troops and Tagore troops. The tanks previously damaged by the British in the battlefield have recently been repaired and can be sent to the front to assist. American tanks have also been shipped. In addition, although the British army has lost several airfields, it has not affected the operations of the British Air Force. All aircraft were also evacuated in advance. Moreover, even if Alexandria is undefended, the British Navy can still continue to operate using the bases of Haifa and Famagusta on Cyprus.

Lisbon, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) According to news from Cairo today, the Axis armored column in North Africa, led by German General Rommel, has reached a point only 15 miles from the British naval base in Alexandria at a rate of 100 miles in 18 hours. Italian and German troops attacked along the northern coast of Egypt, entering Alamein yesterday morning and reaching 30 miles behind the retreating British Eighth Army. It is also reported that the British army is trying to strengthen its last line of defense to intercept the Axis forces' advance. The Cairo Gazette only stated that the British army engaged General Rommel's tank column and a corps carried by trucks yesterday at Alamein, with fierce fighting all day. In the southern sector, British troops engaged the Axis forces in the fiercest tank battle in North Africa north of the Qattara Depression, 17 miles west of the British lines.

Istanbul, 1st (Havas Telegram) According to news from Cairo, since the fall of the fortress of Marsa Matruh on the Egyptian border, residents of Alexandria have been greatly alarmed. A large number of Jews have converted their assets into cash and are preparing to take them elsewhere. It is also rumored that the gold bars in the vaults of the Egyptian banks have been transported elsewhere by plane.

Rome, 1st (Havas Telegram) Jerusalem and Haifa were bombed last night for 25 minutes. Details and losses are not yet known.

### Germany Prepares to Dispatch Reinforcements to Attack the Suez Canal; Auchinleck Issues Letter to Troops, Urging British Officers and Soldiers to Fight Resolutely

A Havas dispatch from Istanbul, dated the 1st: Turkish newspapers have been commenting daily on the Egyptian war situation. Most articles harshly criticize Britain. Sadak, a member of parliament close to the government, published an article in the "Akshan" newspaper, stating that troops must have a national ideology to fight bravely. Some units in the British army in North Africa are not only uninterested in defending Egypt, but also indifferent to Britain itself. In short, whatever the reasons for Britain's defeat, military errors due to politics are a fact. The Allied countries did not pay attention to the Libyan front beforehand, but wasted time talking about opening a second front. Now that the tragic situation in Egypt is apparent, it is unknown how they can still fantasize about opening other battlefields. Furthermore, other newspapers mostly believe that after the fall of Marsa Matruh, the situation has become increasingly serious, as that place is the last obstacle for German forces to attack Alexandria and the Suez Canal. The British Eighth and Tenth Armies may be able to strongly resist the German and Italian forces, but Germany and Italy will definitely not allow the North African front army to fight alone without reinforcement. General List of Germany inspected the troops stationed in Greece and Crete, that is for reinforcing North Africa to attack the Suez Canal.

A Havas dispatch from Cairo, dated the 1st: British Middle East Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck recently issued a letter to officers and soldiers, urging officers and soldiers of all levels to fight resolutely. The letter stated, "The war cannot end one day before we defeat the enemy." For a month, you have encountered fierce battles, which is true, but the enemy has also suffered heavy losses. The strength of the German army is limited, and the transportation line is very long. I deeply hope that all our officers and soldiers will make the greatest efforts to annihilate the enemy in Egypt. You have already shown fighting spirit, and I firmly believe that you will be able to fight to the end and not give the enemy a chance to breathe."

### German and Italian Planes Drop Ice Bricks to Cool Down Troops in Egypt

A Havas dispatch from Rome, dated the 2nd: The Giornale d'Italia newspaper stated yesterday that German and Italian planes often fly to Egypt to drop ice bricks by parachute to cool down the Axis troops. The temperature there reaches 35 degrees Celsius during the day, and drops to 16 or 17 degrees at night. Under the scorching heat, the German and Italian armies can still continue to advance.

### Egyptian Cabinet to Resign En Masse

A Domei dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 2nd: According to a dispatch from the capital of Sweden, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas Pasha convened an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday and the day before. It is expected that in order to adapt to the situation, the entire cabinet will resign en masse. The replacement cabinet may be an anti-British cabinet. According to a dispatch from Cairo, after the Nahas cabinet resigns en masse, former Prime Minister Maher Pasha will come forward to form a coalition cabinet with various parties.

### British Side Refuses to Declare Cairo a Non-Defended City

A Havas dispatch from Ankara, dated the 2nd: The British military authorities refused to declare Cairo a non-defended city. Now Cairo and its surrounding areas have British supply stations and are guarded by British defense forces.

A Havas dispatch from Istanbul, dated the 2nd: According to news from Jerusalem, due to the severity of the situation in Egypt, British Governor of Palestine MacMichael and the Jewish delegation are scheduled to discuss measures to defend Palestine today.

### Handling of French Warships in Alexandria; Rumor is Britain Issued Ultimatum Demanding French Sink Ships Themselves

A Havas dispatch from the capital of Sweden, dated the 2nd: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent discussed last night how to deal with French warships in the port of Alexandria. The conclusion was roughly that, according to international law, we can take necessary measures to prevent the fleet from taking actions unfavorable to Britain. As for what kind of measures, it was not specified.

A Havas dispatch from Vichy, dated the 2nd: According to a Havas correspondent, Schmidt, from reliable sources, the French government and the Navy Department have not heard of the rumors that the British fleet commander in Alexandria issued an ultimatum to Admiral Godfroy, commander of the French warships in the port. It is said that the ultimatum demanded that the French warships be scuttled.

A Havas dispatch from the capital of Sweden, dated the 2nd: According to news received here, Admiral Auban, commander of the French Navy in Alexandria, officially stated in London yesterday that he hoped the French warship crews in Alexandria could help the British move the ships in the port. There is one French battleship, four cruisers, three destroyers, and one submarine in Alexandria.

A Havas dispatch from the capital of Sweden, dated the 2nd: According to an official announcement from London, the French warship "La Momosa" has sunk.

### Saudi Arabia Denies Rumors

A Havas dispatch from Vichy, dated the 2nd: The Saudi Arabian embassy in Vichy issued a statement yesterday denying reports from abroad that Saudi Arabia had allowed the Central Government to build airports in the country. The statement is as follows: Several foreign radio stations have claimed that the Saudi Arabian government has allowed the British government to build airports in the vicinity of Jeddah and Riyadh in the country. Now the Saudi Arabian government solemnly declares that this news is completely unfounded. The government has never allowed anyone to build airports within its territory. Foreign radio stations have also claimed that American officials have arrived in Jeddah after the completion of the Muhammadia relay station to prepare to interfere in Saudi affairs. This report is also fabricated, as there is no place name of Muhammadia within Saudi Arabia. The broadcasting station within Saudi territory has been established for ten years, and its task is to maintain rapid contact with all parts of the country, but these stations have not been forced to suffer foreign interference. The Saudi Arabian government hereby solemnly declares that no one has approached it with the purpose of interfering in the kingdom's affairs. The Saudi government will absolutely not tolerate such behavior. (The picture shows the cityscape of Jeddah. The architectural style of the houses in this city is generally passed down by Javanese people, and they all have balconies.)

### Rice Shops in the Two Concessions to Start Selling Rations Tomorrow; Rice Shop Allocation Completed, Rice Collection in the Two Concessions Changed to Three Dou

The 659 rice shops in the two concessions have been scheduled to start selling household rice to all households from the 4th of this month. Rice will be paid and collected with the first purchase certificate. The amount of rice paid for each purchase certificate is one and a half sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice, totaling two sheng, and the price is five yuan of savings certificates. The registration number of the retail rice shop, the name of each numbered rice shop, and its location are noted on the rice purchase certificate, which has been compiled and checked by the Rice and Grain Management Committee. The details are as follows:

Measures for Reissuing Unclaimed Rice Certificates

It has been found that the rice purchase certificates for July have been issued completely. If Chinese people have not received the certificates due to accidents, please immediately report to their jurisdictional police station. In addition, there are a large number of Chinese servants in foreign residences or institutions who have forgotten to register, resulting in their failure to obtain rice purchase certificates. A final grace period is now granted until noon on the 4th of this month for these people to go through the procedures. Rice will not be issued if the deadline is exceeded, so please pay attention.

Extraction of White Rice and Broken Rice

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the rice shops in the two concessions paid the rice grain office to receive sales orders the day before yesterday, and started to extract white rice and broken rice from Swire and Zhejiang Xingye warehouses from today. The method of matching white rice and broken rice is that those who receive 35 bags of rice receive 26 bags of white rice and 9 bags of broken rice, those who receive 50 bags of rice receive 37 bags of white rice and 13 bags of broken rice, those who receive 70 bags of rice receive 53 bags of white rice and 17 bags of broken rice, and those who receive 85 bags of rice receive 84 bags of white rice and 21 bags of broken rice, and so on.

Remaining Rice Must Not Be Moved

More than 20,000 bags of rice have been extracted from Swire and Xingye warehouses by rice shops in the two concessions the day before yesterday, and more than 10,000 bags were extracted yesterday. The deadline for complete extraction is before the 4th of this month in order to adapt to the second step of the implementation of rationed food on the 6th of this month. The date for purchasing household rice with the first rice purchase certificate in the first week is until the 11th. If the purchase is not made after the deadline, the right to receive rice in the first week will be cancelled. However, the rice shops must not move the remaining rice that citizens have not received, and must truthfully report it to the Rice and Grain Management Committee for disposal.

Severe Penalties for Selling Rice Separately

The amount of household rice received by the rice shops is equal to the amount of rice issued by the Rice and Grain Management Committee, so there will be no shortage or surplus. If the rice shop secretly sells household rice or transfers it for other purposes, resulting in a shortage of rice required to receive rice with the rice purchase certificate, it will be fined ten times. For example, if there is a shortage of one dou of rice, one stone of rice will be fined. The Rice and Grain Management Committee is implementing strict laws to prevent the breeding of abuses from the beginning of rationed food for the sake of balance.

Amount of Flour to be Paired is Undetermined

From the 13th to the 18th, in the second week, citizens will receive one and a half sheng of white rice and a certain amount of flour with the second rice purchase certificate. However, according to the Rice and Grain Management Committee's pre-determined rice quota, if 50 bags of rice are received when receiving household rice in the second week, 200 bags of flour must be paid. However, the rice shops feel exhausted for paying the cash for the household rice every week, and feel powerless to pay for the huge value of flour. Therefore, they are still discussing with the Rice and Grain Committee in order to reach coordination, so the amount supplied to each citizen is still difficult to determine.

Crushed Corn to be Sold Today

The rice shops in the two concessions followed the regulations of the Rice and Grain Management Committee yesterday and did not retail rice. Retail rice will also be stopped on the 5th of this month. However, crushed corn will be sold universally today for one day, with a limit of one and a half sheng per person, and each sheng is sold for two yuan and two jiao in savings certificates. The maximum amount of crushed corn purchased by each rice shop is only 30 bags, and the minimum is only 20 bags. Therefore, the rice shops will generally sell out in only half a day.

Transportation of Rice Changed to Three Dou

The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that starting from Monday, the 6th of this month, the transportation of rice in the Public Concession and the transportation from the Public Concession to the French Concession or from the French Concession to the Public Concession shall be limited to three dou. No transportation permit is required, but for those transporting more than three dou, a permit must first be obtained from the Rice and Flour Office of this Bureau before it can be processed.

### First Deposit and Withdrawal from Central and Agricultural Banks

Starting today, the Shanghai branches of Central, China, Communications, and China Farmers banks will be handled according to the decision of the Japanese authorities. The Central and Agricultural banks will be sealed, and the China and Communications banks will be allowed to reorganize and resume business. In order to take into account the interests of the depositors of the Central and Agricultural banks, the first deposit and withdrawal will be allowed from today. The old currency deposits of each depositor will be converted into the new currency at a ratio of two to one. The limit for the first deposit and withdrawal is 1,000 yuan in new legal currency, but the amount withdrawn from December 8th of last year to May 27th of this year is also included within 1,000 yuan, that is, the amount withdrawn during the above period must be deducted accordingly. The withdrawal time is from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm every day. Deposits of more than 50 yuan must prove that they are non-enemy. It is also reported that the fourth deposit and withdrawal for Citibank depositors will also start today, with a limit of half of the balance after deducting the previous three deposit and withdrawal amounts from the deposit, that is, 50% of the current frozen deposit amount in the bank. This deposit and withdrawal will be entered into the account of Mitsubishi Bank, because the depositors have transferred the remaining deposits from Citibank to the bank in the name of the original depositors during the second deposit and withdrawal. Regarding the reorganization and resumption of business of the China and Communications banks, it has recently been started. The method and date of resumption of business and deposit and withdrawal will be announced by the authorities.

### Registration of Foreigners in the French Concession; From the 6th to the 20th

The English-language Thames newspaper stated that the registration of foreigners in accordance with the order of the former Shanghai Municipal Council is progressing smoothly. Yesterday (the 1st), foreigners in the Public Concession went to the police stations in their respective districts to apply for registration. The police stations also issued application forms until the 15th of this month. It is reported that the same registration procedures will also begin in the French Concession from July 6th, and the deadline is July 20th.

Everyone Over Seven Years Old Must Register

At the same time, the Shanghai Special Police Department has not yet issued accurate information about the registration of foreigners in its jurisdiction. The Shanghai Police Department issued an announcement yesterday that all foreigners going to register must submit their own pass and three photos at the same time. Except for Chinese and Japanese nationals and those with diplomatic privileges, all residents over the age of seven must comply with the above procedures and fulfill the procedures.

Previous Procedures are Invalid This Time

This registration is not related to the previous registration with the Baojia Department or the overseas Chinese groups of their nationality. In other words, all foreigners living in the concession must register again. The motivation for this registration is to maintain the tranquility of the two concessions, so it is hoped that the main food can be universally distributed when the rationed food is implemented in the future.

Changes of Name or Occupation Must Also Be Reported

Foreigners can register at the police stations in their respective districts from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm every day. However, after 4:00 pm on July 15th, the Police Department of the Municipal Council will collect the registration books from the police stations in each district. The Concession authorities also issued an announcement stating that starting yesterday, foreigners' changes of address, births, marriages, name changes, or changes of occupation must be reported to the relevant police station within one week. As for deaths, their relatives must also report to the authorities within 48 hours.

### Low Pressure Moves Out to Sea; The Weather in This City Clears Up

This city has had heavy rain for several days, and the roads have accumulated water into ditches. It only started to clear up yesterday morning because the low pressure has left Shanghai and moved out to sea. The amount of tidal surges in the Huangpu River has been quite high in recent days due to the stimulation of wind and rain. There will be another high tide this afternoon.

### Authorities Suppress Prices and Negotiate Concrete Measures; Setting Prices to Stop Speculative Transactions; Pan Da Expresses Opinions on Suppressing Prices

The Shanghai Thames newspaper stated that Domei News Agency learned last night that the Municipal Council, together with the Japanese Consulate General and the Asia Development Board, will soon take concrete measures to control prices in order to stabilize the living conditions in Shanghai. The measures under consideration include setting the highest price for cotton yarn and preventing the rise in prices of bleached cloth and other items. Furthermore, Chinese businessmen have still been engaged in US dollar and lane currency transactions since the outbreak of the East Asia War, but it is expected that they will soon be banned, as the crackdown on such transactions is under consideration. In recent days, general prices have been trending downwards because control measures are expected to be implemented. Since the implementation of the currency reform in this city, general merchants have dared to take the opportunity to secretly raise prices, resulting in soaring prices, which has had a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Recently, the authorities in this city have been determined to suppress prices and have achieved considerable results. Pan Da, a member of the Price Control Committee of the Public Concession, made the following remarks yesterday:

Strictly Crack Down on Illegal Speculation Pan Da slightly stated, "Since the currency reform, the merchants in this city have used their usual tactics, hoarding goods and speculating, raising prices, and the market in various industries is buying and selling short, like crazy, resulting in soaring prices, more than doubling, which is extremely harmful to society. Therefore, the Chinese and foreign authorities have resolutely decided to crack down on speculation and punish price increases. The Public Concession, French Concession, and Western Shanghai City have actively taken joint actions. This measure is really the main task of maintaining social peace and stability of citizens' lives, and can bring commerce back on track and guide people to engage in production. The general salaried class will benefit a lot, and their lives can be stable. I am fortunate to be a member of the Price Control Committee of the Public Concession, and I will do my best to advocate suppressing prices, because I am confident that this move will be of great benefit to society." In addition, there are two other claims:

Vegetables and Food Should Be Suppressed Quickly

Vegetables and food are essential and indispensable for nutrition, and are even more important than cotton cloth and leather shoes. Their prices should be lowered more quickly. Those who do not sell in accordance with the adjusted prices should be severely punished and never tolerated.

Solutions to the Housing Gold Problem

Regarding the housing gold problem, since the currency reform, there is no definite standard for the conversion of new and old currencies for housing gold, resulting in landlords being unable to collect rent and tenants being unwilling to pay rent. Both sides insist, forming a stalemate. In my opinion, landlords have two burdens of increased land tax, and tenants have a two-to-one conversion of old legal currency to new legal currency. Both sides have their reasons, and it is not easy to seek a win-win situation. However, the fairest thing is to add 50% to the old legal currency housing gold on May 26, and then convert it to new legal currency by dividing it in half. For example, if the housing gold was originally 200 yuan in old legal currency, add 50% to become 300 yuan. Now, pay 150 yuan in new legal currency by dividing it in half. This is a suggestion for social reference. If a solution can be obtained through this, it would be a blessing for society.

### Difficulty Finding Guarantees for Baojia Registration; Appeals Can Be Made; Baojia Expenses are Free Donations and No Other Taxes Are Paid

Difficulty Finding Guarantees for Baojia Registration

Baojia Expenses are Free Donations and No Other Taxes Are Paid The French Concession authorities, in view of the fact that Chinese residents in the concession often encounter difficulties in finding guarantees for Baojia registration, hereby notify the relevant people that if the second landlord refuses to act as a guarantor, they can appeal to the Jia Chief, Bao Chief, or Lianbao Chief, or report to the jurisdictional police station, which will immediately send someone to investigate and handle the case separately. In addition, the expenses required for the Baojia organization and its activities can be donated by the residents. In addition, residents do not need to pay any other taxes except for the new 5 jiao fee for applying for a resident identity card.

### The Municipal Council Stops Issuing Temporary Passes

The Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee previously issued a temporary pass to facilitate citizens' travel to and from various places. Its validity period expired on June 30. Now that the above pass has expired, the committee has decided not to issue it again after consultation with the authorities. The repatriation pass will be issued as usual. I hope that all fellow villager associations and groups will actively apply.

### Workers' Technical Training Night School Regularly Enrolls New Students

The Municipal Council's Industrial and Social Affairs Department declared that the Workers' Technical Training Night School will enroll 210 new students in the first, second, and third grades of the mechanical engineering department this autumn. Technicians and workers of mechanical factories and apprentices who have completed their apprenticeships can apply. In addition, a lightning engineering department will be added to enroll 80 new students in the first grade. Technicians and workers of lightning equipment business houses, electrical machinery manufacturing plants, and other factories' electrical parts, and apprentices who have completed their apprenticeships can apply. The entrance examination is scheduled to be held at 7:00 pm on August 21.

### Evacuation of Ningbo Coffins; Registration and Transportation are Limited

Since the Japanese military authorities decided to evacuate the coffins left in Shanghai and entrusted the coffin transportation department of Guohua Funeral Home and Siming Guild to handle the evacuation of Ningbo coffins first, they have been shipped out in six batches, with outstanding results. The coffin relatives have all praised it. Seeing the successful handling, the authorities decided that the Ningbo coffins in the coffin storage places of the funeral homes and the guild halls should be evacuated to Ningbo in a limited time. The relevant authorities also ordered the coffin storage places of the funeral homes to notify all coffin relatives to be sure to follow the will and hurry to register at the coffin transportation department of Guohua Funeral Home at No. 96, East Head, Huaan Building, Jingan Temple Road, so that they can be shipped in batches, and it is reported that the deadline is the end of this month, and those who do not register will be buried.

### Health Magazine Nutrition Special Issue

The July-August issue of the Chinese Health Magazine is a nutrition special issue and was published the day before yesterday. As the editor said, in this time of intense life, the publication of a nutrition special issue will be blamed for being out of touch with current affairs. In fact, in peaceful times, this issue is not so important, but at a time when food is expensive and scarce, if we do not estimate the nutritional value of food and know what to choose, it will not only be useless, but also cause diseases and increase the economic burden. It is sold at the China Medical Association at No. 41 Chihama Road and at various newspaper stands. Each copy is one yuan, and the annual subscription is five yuan. The magazine is currently soliciting manuscripts for cash. Cartoons related to health and hygiene are welcome. Each group must have four manuscripts, each of which should be 3.5 inches high and 2.5 inches wide, black on white paper, and sent to the editorial department of the magazine at No. 41 Chihama Road, Shanghai before August 1.

### Exhibition of Past Dynasty Banknotes

Guan Jiangmin, a Chinese banknote collector, has spent more than 30 years of his efforts collecting banknotes from past dynasties in China, from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties to modern banknotes, numbering no less than thousands of kinds. In order to promote art and culture and study the origins of ancient and modern paper money, a Chinese banknote exhibition will be held at the Young Men's Christian Association in Baxianqiao from July 4. Among them, precious banknotes, such as the Tang Dynasty Military Discipline Note and the Great Ming Circulating Treasure Note, are rare in the world. Tickets are sold for 3 yuan, and groups of ten or more people will be discounted by half. Sales have now begun.

### Zhang Zhenlu's Cursive Script Fan Surfaces

Zhang Zhenyuan's cursive script fan surfaces sold out a few days ago. The West Liangchen Good Friends Society on Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road, in response to popular demand, will re-sell 100 new fan surfaces painted by Zhang from today, at a low price of 5 yuan each (including the price of the fan surface material). Famous paintings and co-authored fans are 7 yuan each. Within the day, bring your own fan to set books and half the fee will be deducted.

### Cultivating Flowers and Collecting Rocks

— Qin Meng

Recently, when friends gather, they all complain that what they hear and see is filled with too many unpleasant things, to the point where they feel they can’t live like this anymore! Changing careers to do business is something outsiders shouldn't do, and even thinking about the 100,000 to 800,000 capital needed is simply impossible to acquire. Therefore, most people are depressed, drinking coffee, and playing small card games, which have become common habits! Those with a bit more refinement copy Han Dynasty stone inscriptions or play Go, ultimately expressing their deep sorrow through leisure. Let me tell you about one of these friends. Before the war, his life wasn’t luxurious, but it was worry-free. Recently, things haven't been right. Out of boredom and for a living, he's now running a business selling flowers, plants, and artificial rockeries. Yesterday, I visited him to chat and see the flower garden he'd recently set up.

This flower garden isn't large and is located near Carter Road. It's an old-style Western house. Upon entering, there's a corridor. Leaning on the railing, you can see about two hundred potted flowers, plants, and bonsai scattered like stars. That's the bird's-eye view. To appreciate them closely, you have to step down the stone steps and slowly walk along the winding path paved with small stones. All around, left, right, front, and back, are unusual flowers and strange rocks, arranged cleverly and with a touch of poetry.

When I went in, the owner was intently working on a bonsai. In front of him was a model, a bamboo scene painting by the Ming Dynasty artist Huang Zhongzhao, featuring a bamboo forest, a small bridge and flowing water, and two figures in ancient attire standing idly, gazing into the distance. The layout of the bonsai imitated it very closely. To me, this felt like a discovery: art has commonalities. Natural landscapes, after artificial pruning, rendered in a picture on paper, is photography; a concrete and miniature model is a garden, is a bonsai.

The owner said: Cultivating flowers is an art, a good way to cultivate one's spirit. Though it's a form of recreation, it takes a lot of thought. There are two goals in cultivating flowers: one is to use methods to make the cultivated flowers and fruits particularly lush or small. For example, peonies are usually the size of a fist, but in previous years when I visited Beiping, just when the peonies in the Summer Palace were blooming, they were not only every color—yellow, white, red, and green—but also the blossoms were so large, almost like watermelons. At first, I thought they were well-bred, but when I asked the palace eunuchs, I learned that this was the result of their unique cultivation method. It turns out that Empress Dowager Cixi loved peonies and spared no expense. Every other year, they would bury rotten pig intestines around the flower roots, and the following year, the flowers would bloom extraordinarily large. However, the flowers would only bloom once before withering and dying. That's one example. Some people bury lotus seeds in mud pots, and after a certain amount of time, small lotus leaves the size of silver dollars and lotus flowers the size of copper coins will sprout, with excellent color and fragrance, making them exquisite table offerings. In addition, using artificial means to change the color of flowers can also be classified in this category. The second category is what is called bonsai. The materials used are slightly different, and the methods are more difficult. Trees like pine, bamboo, plum, cypress, privet, and boxwood grow slowly and are suitable for making bonsai. We select good materials, and the first step is to bend or prune them to give them a shape and a sense of antiquity. The second step is to plant them in pots and then embellish the surface of the pot, inserting a piece of rock here and building a small house there, all of which requires careful management. This work involves talent. The main conditions are to have literary intention, avoid stiffness, and maintain proportional harmony.

The owner also said: In Japan, many people study horticulture, and their works are very outstanding. They also have a technique where they chemically decompose things like books and newspapers, mash them into mud, and mold them into artificial mountains, rugged and craggy, to their heart's content. After drying, they paint them with colors or cover them with moss, making them look just like natural ones.

Later, when talking about collecting rocks, I said: My father had a passion like Mi Fu of the Song dynasty. In our hometown of Yixing, which is mountainous, he built a villa called “Wood and Stone Residence,” taking the meaning from Mencius, “Dwelling with wood and stone, roaming with deer and pigs.” He searched for unusual rocks for nearly twenty years, acquiring no fewer than two or three hundred pieces. Some were exquisite, some resembled objects, truly a "vast spectacle, with endless beauty." Let me tell you about two of the unusual rocks. One is called “Squirrel Stealing Grapes.” The stone is igneous rock, yellowish-brown in color. The upper part is shaped like a "squirrel's head, with a thick tail held high." It stands tall, its head slightly raised, as if it's stealing grapes and has been discovered, showing a startled and ready-to-leap appearance. Below, there are layers of rounded stone pebbles, numerous and uniform, indeed a bunch of grapes. There's a poem to attest to it: "A leaping squirrel, clusters of grapes, when did they turn to stone, their forms cannot escape… created by heaven, ingenious to the finest detail." The second, probably a product of Yuhuatai, is shaped like a jade tablet. One side is dark green, and on the flatter side, the stone color suddenly fades, revealing black patterns in the middle, like a gnarled pine tree, with a crane standing alone on top, lifelike. There's also a poem to record it: "Hiding traces in the clouds, ancient and covered in ice and snow, in the clear breeze and bright moon night, its cry stirs human thoughts." Since the war began, my family has left our hometown to take refuge. When we left, naturally, there was no way to carry all these rocks with us, but abandoning them was really heartbreaking. After thinking it over, we simply packed them in many wooden boxes and stored them in the home of an old household in the countryside. For now, they've fortunately been preserved, but the flames of war haven't subsided, and the old garden is desolate. When will the day come when I can caress and bow to them again? Every time I think of this, I feel forlorn. (The End)

### Trip to Hong Kong and Shanghai

— Gao Qiliang

In the second half of last year, Britain and the United States banned the shipment of products from their colonies and related military raw materials to Shanghai. It wasn’t until the United States froze funds and the Shanghai Customs banned the southern shipment of sixteen types of industrial products that the economic war reached a fever pitch. The outbreak of a major war was only a matter of time. I also thought the situation was quite tense, but due to business reasons, I went to Hong Kong in mid-October, intending to return to Shanghai around the end of November. After settling everything on November 28th, I booked a ticket at the China Travel Service in Hong Kong for the Mingsheng Steamer leaving for Shanghai on December 4th. I received the ticket on the 2nd. At that time, the atmosphere everywhere was already quite bad. I secretly thought that since I had the ticket in hand, nothing could possibly change. On the 4th, the situation in Shanghai was already serious. Because news was tightly controlled in Hong Kong, there wasn't much outward indication. In the afternoon, the travel agency notified me that the ship was delayed. The post office also announced the suspension of registered mail to Shanghai and areas north. People began to waver a little at this point. I also heard that all British transport ships were summoned to concentrate in Hong Kong to await orders. At this point, half of my hope of returning to Shanghai was dashed. On the morning of the 8th, passengers returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong and those heading to Shanghai from Yantai, Xiamen, and other places all landed in Hong Kong. They said that they had already reached the Wusongkou area but were turned back to Hong Kong. Before the war, all passengers traveling to Hong Kong from elsewhere had to first obtain an immigration permit from the Hong Kong government; otherwise, they wouldn't be allowed to land. It was said that they had been anchored in Hong Kong for several days and weren't allowed to go ashore until the situation became extremely critical, at which point they were allowed to escape. At this point, I knew the situation was bad, but Japanese planes were already soaring in the sky. Starting that day, all ships sailing from Hong Kong to various places were suspended. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong Ferry also only allowed those with special permits from Kowloon to pass; everyone else was cut off.

The war lasted for seventeen consecutive days, ending on the 25th. In early January, currency exchange in Guangzhou resumed first, and postal service resumed on the 25th. Soon, the Guangzhou Bay line was also restored under the supervision of the Homecoming Guidance Committee. Everyone thought that the resumption of the Shanghai line was only a matter of time. Before the war, the Guangzhou-Shanghai line had regular ships from the East Asia Shipping Company, but the procedures were very troublesome. Rather than transferring in Guangzhou, it was better to wait a few more days. But I didn’t know if things would be the same as before. Later, many who couldn't wait any longer transferred through Guangzhou to return to Shanghai, some by land. Although Guangzhou and Hong Kong were very close at that time, because only returning home was allowed, not coming to Hong Kong, the actual situation in Guangzhou was unknown. Fortunately, I had a friend there who wrote a letter to ask, and the reply said that there were ships, but they were not regular, and the procedures were very difficult. I waited again and again, and by mid-April, there was still no news of resumption. Just at this time, I received another letter from Guangzhou saying that starting from the 5th, the procedures for returning to Shanghai had been changed. Previously, one had to first obtain a guarantor and apply for a travel permit, then send it to a military agency to be stamped before being able to ask the East Asia Shipping Company to buy a ticket. After the change, one only needed to obtain a travel permit and send it to the military police to be stamped, and then a ticket could be purchased. According to the previous procedure, it would take two to three months to complete, but after the change, it could be completed in one or two weeks. After receiving the letter, I boarded the Yiyang Maru on the 16th and arrived in Guangzhou the next afternoon. On the 19th, I completed the procedures for applying for a travel permit, and on the 27th, I received the travel permit. The next day, I sent it to the military police to be stamped, and I picked it up on the afternoon of the 29th.

Before the procedures were changed, because the procedures for obtaining a permit were difficult, buying a ticket was easier. After the change, because there were few tickets and many people, buying a ticket was more difficult than obtaining a permit. Therefore, a black market emerged. Fortunately, with the help of a friend, I managed to get a ticket for the Tainan Maru departing on May 3rd. Before boarding, I had to prepare papers for three vaccinations—cholera, enteric fever, and smallpox—and a stool test certificate. In addition, I had to prepare a small packet of my own stool from that day to be checked again on the ship. I couldn't buy a second-class ticket, so I bought a third-class ticket. The third-class ticket was like the steerage class on the Taikoo ships. After boarding, I saw that the second-class cabins were all empty, but I wasn't allowed to switch on the ship. Moreover, the empty cabins were prepared to carry British and American expatriates being exchanged in Hong Kong—although this ship docked in Hong Kong, it didn't publicly sell tickets there—I wanted to find a steward to buy a berth, but the price of a berth started at 150 yuan in legal tender and rose to 800 yuan in less than ten minutes. Later, in Hong Kong, it rose to 3,000 yuan, and I still couldn't buy a berth.

The next day, I arrived in Hong Kong. On the 5th, I arrived in Shantou to load goods, on the 6th, I arrived in Xiamen, and on the 8th, I arrived in Keelung, Taiwan. After stopping outside the port for a day, I had another stool test. The next day, I loaded coal, and on the 11th, I resumed the voyage, arriving at the Huishan Wharf in Shanghai on the 12th. The journey was very quiet. Attached notes: All transactions in Guangzhou are calculated in military currency. A third-class ticket from Hong Kong to Guangzhou costs 6.5 yuan in military currency, and a third-class ticket from Guangzhou to Shanghai, including meals, costs 31 yuan in military currency. There is no fee for obtaining a travel permit. Telegraphic money orders between Guangzhou and Shanghai can be sent. The price of military currency in Guangzhou is higher than in Shanghai. On May 13th, the price in Shanghai was 7 yuan, and in Guangzhou, it was 13 yuan. It is said that it has recently reached 20 yuan. However, the military currency in Guangzhou and Shanghai is different. Recently, people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang in Hong Kong have launched a land route to return to Shanghai, and several batches have arrived safely, while others are on the way. It is also said that Hong Kong recently allows elderly people to take ships, while young people travel by land. 31st, 6th, 21st. (Remuneration to help students)

### Free Opening of Epidemic Hospital

The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Zhaqing Road originally planned to add an epidemic department on June 16th, but due to lack of funding and expensive drug prices, it was forced to postpone. It is now learned that the hospital held a charity opera performance at the Golden Theater at the end of last month, inviting famous actors and amateur performers, and raised funds. The hospital's epidemic department also opened a few days ago. Poor civilians suffering from epidemic diseases can receive free treatment and hospitalization.

### Christian Systematic Lectures

The Shanghai YMCA, in order to promote a deeper understanding of Christianity among people in society and to integrate faith and life, is organizing a series of Christian lectures starting in June.

It is learned that the July lectures have also been announced downstairs in the YMCA building. The overall theme is "Christ in Daily Life," and it is divided into four sub-themes: July 4th, Christians and Money, presented by Chen Yisheng, an insurance manager from Ning Shao Life Insurance Company; July 11th, Christians and Interpersonal Relationships, presented by Yang Yihui, Deputy General Secretary of the YMCA; July 18th, Christians and Leisure, presented by Lin Buji, Principal of Huashi Public School; July 25th, Christian Views on Sexuality, presented by Pastor Wei Xiben of All Saints Church.

### Sunday Round Gateball League, Hua Nan vs. Zhong Lian

The first Guobin Cup Round Gateball League, with the four games originally scheduled for last weekend postponed due to rain, will be held this Wednesday. Subsequently, due to Zhong Lian's lack of time, it was decided to postpone it again to this Sunday (the 5th), still at Guangxia Middle School. There will be three men's group matches and one women's group match. The women's Aiguo team will play against the Lingsheng team, and in the men's group, the V team will meet Nanyang, and Yaoguang will meet Qiangxing. Yaoguang is a rising force, boasting many famous players, while Qiangxing is known as a battle-hardened team. This time, with Bao Songyuan joining to lend his support, it feels even more like adding flowers to brocade. In another match, Zhong Lian will face Hua Nan. The former brings together the most elite members of the film industry, with an invincible lineup, while the latter has recently won the Mengxian Cup and Xiaguang Cup championships in succession. It is expected that there will be an exciting performance. The three games originally scheduled for this weekend will be postponed to the following weekend.

### Purchasing Power of Hardware is Significantly Different From the Past

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of hardware supplies has disappeared. Factories in this city have closed down one after another. Merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai, as well as those from the Yangtze River and the Nanyang Islands, have been sluggish. The sales of all goods have also stopped. At that time, the hardware industry was extremely bleak due to the interruption of both incoming and outgoing sales. Until the end of April, because movement permits could be obtained, real sales showed a slight improvement in early May. However, the purchasing power was less than one-tenth of what it was before. Until now, transactions are still quiet. Currently, the market for various goods is stable only because real sales are weak and confidence is difficult to boost. Yesterday, 200-pound American-made steel was selling for 1,800 yuan per box, single-layer tinplate for 1,000 yuan per box, double-layer tinplate for 2,000 yuan per box, Old Bear steel for 750 yuan, Shuangma steel for 750 yuan, 200-pound narrow strip steel for 1,400 yuan, 2,000-pound black steel billets for 14,000 yuan per bundle, wind steel for 190 yuan per pound, 40-foot cement reinforcing steel for 9,000 yuan per ton, 36-foot black iron sheet for 16,000 yuan per ton, new steel plates from 1.5 to 7.5 li (unit of length) thick for 12,000 yuan per ton, one point to thick patterned iron sheet for 13,000 yuan per ton, new road iron for 12,000 yuan per ton, new angle iron for 11,000 yuan, and new foreign round square plate for 10,000 yuan (the last three add extra depending on pattern).

### New Broad Beans: Arrivals Match Sales

Bean cakes were inquired about only slightly in nearby rural areas, with weak demand from inland merchants. 500 pieces of April new goods from Shengji bean cake were traded at 57 yuan, and 500 pieces of June new goods at 57 yuan.

### Fluctuations Seen in Sugar Stocks

Yesterday's sugar stock list from the Cooperation Business Office saw little trading in the guild, with a flat trend and mixed ups and downs. The transaction price for coarse sugar stocks was 323 yuan, up 1 yuan. It was noted that the previous day's call price was 322 yuan, showing a slight tightening. Red sugar stocks, on the other hand, eased slightly, with transactions at 311.5 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the previous day. For the time being, it seems unlikely that there will be any excessive increases or decreases.

### Walnuts Stable

With recent arrivals and sales both scarce, the walnut market has gradually stabilized. Most of the merchants' existing inventory has been placed in cold storage to prevent it from being unloaded immediately as the market fluctuates, resulting in a more stable market situation. Merchants' hand-picked walnuts were priced at 270 yuan, Changping walnuts at 260 yuan, Tei walnuts at 190 to 200 yuan, and walnut meat at 600 yuan.

### Bitter Apricot Kernels Experiencing Shortage of Spot Goods

The price of bitter apricot kernels previously reached a peak due to a lack of arrivals and currency system issues. Although there were declines along the way, it was difficult to loosen the market. Most of the current inventory has been placed in cold storage. With little spot goods available, and the cost of cold storage being higher than before, the cost has naturally increased. Red-skinned apricot kernels are not abundant, and white-skinned bitter apricot kernels are extremely scarce. According to firm reports, the asking price has risen another 50 yuan.

### Learning and Profession

— Liu Yueshen

What is learning? It is any path that transforms the unknown into the known; it is not necessarily limited to reading books, but also includes observation, experimentation, and consulting others. What is a profession? It is any endeavor, whether mental or physical, that directly or indirectly contributes to society. Those who use improper means and engage in activities that harm others for their own benefit cannot be called legitimate practitioners, but are merely social swindlers and robbers.

Why do we need a profession? It is a kind of obligation. Because our enjoyment of all necessities and luxuries of life depends on the efforts of others, we should also do our best to serve others. Why do we need to learn? People are not born with knowledge. In order to be competent and happy in one's profession, one must first go through the stage of learning. After entering a profession, one must continue to learn in order to improve and develop in that profession.

Learning and profession are inherently inseparable, like a shadow following its form. However, in today's society, the connection between learning and profession has gradually weakened and is even on the verge of being severed, resulting in many unfortunate phenomena.

As the saying goes, "A hero has no place to use his strength." There are indeed many people like this, full of knowledge but with no opportunity to use it for society, resulting in frustration and resentment until the end of their lives. Conversely, those who hold high positions are not necessarily talented and knowledgeable, and some are even incompetent. On the one hand, talent is buried, and on the other hand, careers are delayed. This is all due to the fact that the selection of personnel does not emphasize talent selection, but only relies on the nepotism of relatives and friends.

Those who step from the school gates into the professional world often encounter a difficult problem: "What is learned is not used, and what is used is not learned." Graduation diplomas and grade reports are only suitable as decorations for the office. In reality, what is used is mostly what has not been learned. No one can deny that this is due to the separation between schools and the professional world. Education authorities should also consider the actual social conditions in China when determining subjects. Why insist on "the American educational system is like this" or "the British schools are like that"? It must be understood that England and America are ultimately England and America, while China is still China.

Furthermore, the trend of changing careers is also very prevalent in our country. For example, someone who originally studied mechanics might abandon the factory and enter the bank because the bank's compensation is higher. Regardless of right or wrong, the gains and losses to society are very obvious.

Learning and profession should join hands closely, because this not only affects an individual's life, but also has a significant impact on society!

### Good Words

— Sun Dexiang

Our hearts are like parachutes; they are only useful when opened. -- Tian Wei

The key to happiness lies not in how much material wealth we have, but in how we enjoy it. -- Spalson

Without health, life loses its vitality; life can only become a weary journey—the human body is like an idol of death. -- Raibel

### Cooperation

— Jiang Hu

Do not act alone; cooperation is the only way to succeed in life.

Running your own business is like walking alone, but working for others is like having dozens or hundreds of people working for you.

Do not be too quick to blame others. Blaming others will only make them angry and cause you to lose a friend.

Spend more time gaining the favor of your colleagues. This way, when you encounter difficulties, they will help you solve them.

A mature person is always considerate of others' mistakes, oversights, and harms. In this way, others will be loyal to you.

If you want your subordinates to be loyal to you, you must first be loyal to them.

You cannot force someone to work for you. However, if you can win their heart, they will automatically ask to work for you.

True leaders always try to avoid creating an enemy or causing an employee or worker to harbor resentment.

### In the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jiazhi

(6) A Snap of the Fingers

The shop assistant in the store said, "Yes, there is. Go straight ahead, pass the black-walled alley, about ten houses away, that is the Chen family. Chen's granddaughter, whose name is Guofang, right?" Weicheng said, "How could it not be, it's them." Weicheng followed the person's guidance and indeed passed a black-walled alley. Counting in order, it was probably more than ten houses away. In front of one alley, there was a large elm tree. Under the tree sat an old woman-like person, holding a piece of black-skinned white-fleshed melon and stuffing it into her mouth, as if she were enjoying it very much. Weicheng asked, "Excuse me, is this the Chen family? Mr. Chen Guoqi's home?" Although the old woman was old, her hearing was still very clear. Hearing Weicheng ask her this, she immediately stood up from a low stool; immediately swallowed the small half of the melon all at once; immediately pulled the front of her blue summer cloth short shirt to wipe her mouth, and replied, "Yes, we are. Our master is not at home. Young master, where are you from?" Weicheng was a little disappointed, saying, "I'm from Huagang, surnamed Ye." The old woman said, "Young master Ye from Huagang, I often hear Miss Fang talk about you. Young master Ye, please come inside, our old lady is at home." Weicheng said, "Yes, yes, I should pay my respects to the old lady. Has Miss Fang returned?" The old woman walked in front, saying, "Young master Ye, please lower your head and come in. This house is old, and it's easy to bump your head." Weicheng really lowered his head, and lifted his lapel, walked through an alley, inside was a small courtyard. Facing the front were three or four rooms, and on the west side were two wing rooms. In one corner of the yard, there were some firewood and grass piled up, and some potted plants. It seemed that no one had watered or cultivated them, there were no flowers, but grass grew all over the pots.

The old woman introduced, calling, "Old lady, there's a young master Ye from Huagang here." The old woman spun around, spinning to lift the bamboo curtain of the wing room door. Weicheng stopped in the courtyard, only to see vaguely through the curtain, an old woman saying, "Oh, young master Ye has come, please come inside." The old woman still lifted the curtain with one hand, smiling, "Young master Ye, our old lady invites you to come inside." Weicheng said, "Yes, yes." He bent down, and walked inside from the curtain.

### An Attempt at Washing Clothes Myself

— Xinmeng

If you don't have a family in Shanghai and live the life of a bachelor, not only does eating become a problem, but washing clothes also feels a bit troublesome. Taking a set of short shirts and pants or a long gown to an old woman who washes clothes for others costs a yuan. The original Gu Ben soap has already risen to five yuan a bar. In this way, you can't change clothes more than a dozen times a month, and for washing clothes, twenty or thirty yuan is gone. The heads of the salaried class are already flattened and can't be lifted up, how can there be so much money to wash clothes?

In this day and age, if you want to struggle for survival, you should do everything yourself. There is no way to increase income, but there should always be a way to reduce expenses. Washing clothes is one example. Since this semester, several colleagues have mostly washed their own clothes. Every weekend, taking advantage of leisure time, everyone washes the clothes they have accumulated during the week. According to informal statistics, a bar of soap can wash more than a dozen sets of short shirts and pants. Although Gu Ben costs five yuan a bar, it is more economical than hiring someone to wash them!

My clothes have always been washed by a maid in a relative's house. Recently, they dismissed the maid, so my washing clothes has also become a problem. Sending them to a laundry is out of the question, and even asking someone to wash them would cost a lot of money each month. Seeing that everyone is washing their own clothes, can't I do it? So I decided to imitate and try.

One Saturday afternoon, I started to try, bought a bar of soap, and spent a full two hours washing a long gown, a set of short shirts and pants, and two pairs of socks. Looking at the soap, not much was used. The first time I tried, it was indeed quite difficult, but after practicing every week, not only did I not feel difficult, but I also didn't feel any different, as the saying goes, habit becomes nature, right? Having never washed clothes before, I have now learned some washing methods and skills, which is also something worth telling others.

### The Expectations of Three Tenants

— Zhiqin

The second landlord, seeing that the currency system reform had increased water and electricity charges, thought that the opportunity to profit from the crisis had come again. Although the concession authorities had expressed that "second landlords shall not profit more than 20% from the rent of third tenants," the statement was only a statement. If you want to live there, "you must increase the rent." If you can't afford it, "please get out." The term "second landlord" is so sought after!

The style of the second landlord is truly beyond words. Living for free is the most basic right of the second landlord, but in addition to living and eating for free, some also want to use things for free. Therefore, a problem arises with the house, which is the opportunity for the second landlord to make a fortune. If the main landlord increases the rent by 10% or 20%, the second landlord must increase it by no less than 30% or 40%. The increase in water and electricity charges is another good excuse for the second landlord to increase the rent. Now that the currency system has changed, the second landlord is taking Central Reserve Certificates on a one-to-one basis, and still says it is fair. Being a second landlord is really eating endlessly!

Now let me give an example. Our second landlord rents a three-story building with two storefronts. The total rent for the whole house is only two hundred and forty or fifty yuan. They occupy a storefront, a two-story building, and a pavilion room themselves. The remaining rented houses still receive three hundred and seventy or eighty yuan. After the issuance of the new currency system order, he also wanted to collect the rent from the third tenants on a one-to-one basis, and still said that he didn't want to make money on the rent. I wonder how one can say that he is making money, and how can he satisfy the second landlord's gluttony.

In the current environment, no matter what you eat, wear, live, or travel, you can't escape the shackles and oppression of the serious environment. However, clothes can be "tied a hundred knots", food can be "thin porridge", travel can be "on foot", but living cannot always "dream a yellow beam dream" on the "cement". I saw in the newspaper the day before yesterday that "the concession authorities are studying fair measures for the rent issue." It is expected that a method will be announced soon. I deeply hope that the rent authorities will have a fair statement, but whether the second landlord can act in accordance with the regulations of the concession authorities is still a question!

### Ink

— Li

As the cost of living rises daily, cultural people are the most severely hit. Taking the most common ink for writing manuscripts, it used to be only one or two jiao, but now it costs four or five yuan a bottle. The manuscript fee, however, has not increased much. In this environment, cultural people can only save as much as possible. Recently, I heard that Shanghai has a kind of affordable and high-quality ink sheet on the market, costing one yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per sheet, which can dissolve two liang of ink, equivalent to a regular bottle. In terms of cost, it is more than half the price of the cheapest ink on the market. Moreover, in terms of quality, it is brighter than ordinary ink and has no sediment. Everyone may want to try it.

### Money and Strength

— Gao Ju

People have never despised money, scorned money, and distrusted money as much as they do today. Now, all smart people are unwilling to keep cash by their side, and even young children will say, "Prices won't rise, it's the value of the currency that's falling." "Omnipotent" money has rarely been in such a predicament, although the money now is not necessarily gold.

In the history of the world, we can still find some precedents. The most famous one is after the First World War, when Germany, in 1923, was forced by war debts to inflate its currency, resulting in an unprecedented "crash" in the value of the paper Mark. At that time, the prestige of money had probably fallen to its lowest point. People had to use millions of Marks to send a letter, tens of millions of Marks to buy an egg, and had to carry a large "bundle" of banknotes to the theater to exchange for a seat ticket. If anyone doesn't believe this, they can run and ask a friend who collects stamps, and he will show you many stamps from that time worth 50 million, 200 million Marks—very pitiful! These stamps are still the least valuable to this day, and they are also the ugliest; their huge and astonishing "price" cannot be valued by people.

At that time, the most unlucky people were probably those who worshipped and relied on money the most. A miser might become penniless overnight, or at least be anxious about the most appropriate way to dispose of his money—to be the safest, most permanent, and most profitable or least loss-making—resulting in sleepless nights and uneasy meals, just like many rich people in Shanghai today.

Conversely, the luckiest people are those who have the least money. A rickshaw puller, after pulling a rickshaw for half a day, immediately became a "millionaire," although what he could enjoy was still only cornbread and a thatched shed, but at least it was no worse than before. So if we don't consider the original injustice, he is lucky. Because he doesn't rely on money, he only relies on his own strength, he is not affected by changes in currency value. Similarly, all those who "earn their own living" are lucky; they don't earn money, they just use their own strength to maintain their lives. However, precisely because they exert their strength and make contributions, society needs them and cannot abandon them. It must give them the remuneration that can maintain their lives, although it is inevitably excessively harsh, but they will at least never lose these harsh guarantees.

It's Better to Have a Skill Than a Hundred Acres of Good Land

Of course, there are also people complaining bitterly, such as saying "the speed of salary increase is not as fast as the speed of price increase," etc. This is indeed painful, but fortunately this kind of pain will not last long, and the more unreasonable the pain, the less it will last. The happiness of those who earn happiness by strength rather than money is very solid and certain. As for the group of people who cannot endure temporary pain and are using "illegal" ways to make money, if they are not unworthy of our contempt, they are at least unworthy of envy, especially those who rely on this illegal money to act arrogantly and indulge in enjoyment will not last long. The fate of their future is undoubtedly tragic, and it will be far more tragic than what good people are suffering now.

I remember reading an article written by a German in a magazine, talking about the various situations during the era of the Mark's crash in 1923. At the end, there were a few words that are worth remembering: "From the unreliability of money, we have recognized the preciousness of reliable things… From this experience, I learned a never-fading lesson: true security does not exist in the external things we possess, but in our own souls and everything we can create."

As the saying goes, "It's better to have a skill than a hundred acres of good land." Good land is not as good as a skill, let alone fragile banknotes. Now many people are exchanging money for gold, stocks, bonds, real estate, and even various practical items. It's clever to be clever, but it's still just equal to "good land"!
