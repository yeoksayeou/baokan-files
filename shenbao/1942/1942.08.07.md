### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces: Occupation of Three Islands North of Australia; Arafura Sea Under Japanese Control

Tokyo, 6th (Domei News Agency) - This afternoon, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that the Japanese Navy had occupied military strongholds in the Kei Islands, Aru Islands, and Tenimber Islands on July 30th. These three island groups are all located in the Arafura Sea north of Australia.

Tokyo, 6th (Domei News Agency) - This afternoon, the Imperial Headquarters announced that the Japanese Navy occupied strategic points in the Aru and Tenimber island groups in the Arafura Sea north of Australia on July 30th. Well-informed sources have commented on this, expressing their belief that the current operation has practically completed the Japanese military campaign in the Dutch East Indies and its surrounding areas. The three island groups occupied by the Japanese Navy were the last enemy bases in the area, and they have now become "extremely dangerous bases" for the Japanese army to attack Allied forces. The Tenimber Islands are only 200 nautical miles from Australia. Since Japanese aircraft attacked Port Hedland in northern Australia and Townsville in eastern Australia, and Sydney's Newcastle was attacked by Japanese submarines, Australia has effectively come under the control of the Japanese Navy. Well-informed sources claim that British and American supply lines have been completely cut off, and Australia has indeed become an "orphan in the Pacific."

Geneva (Switzerland), 5th (Havas News Agency) - According to a Reuters correspondent in Sydney, Australia is watching the developments in India with unease. India's desire for freedom is understood by the Australian people, but the majority still support the British position.

### Colonel Hagi of the Japanese Army Advocates: Resolving the Indian Issue by Force; Congress Party Reaffirms Demand for Independence

Osaka, 6th (Domei News Agency) - Colonel Hagi, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, attended the "Grand Rally to Strengthen National Unity for the Greater East Asia War" held in Nagoya on the 4th and delivered a speech. At 5:00 PM on the 5th, he arrived here by special express train. In the train, the Colonel met with the Osaka Army press corps and delivered a speech, strongly advocating the resolution of India, Australia, and Chongqing by thorough force. He frankly explained the path Japan should take during wartime, stating that even if Britain allows India to become independent, India would still be Britain's India. In order for India to become the India of Asians, Japan must use force. Furthermore, if Australia remains unenlightened and ignores Japan's friendly gestures, then Japan will launch a military operation before the United States launches an offensive against Japan in 1944. As for Chongqing, for the sake of achieving lasting world peace, it is especially necessary to resolve it with thorough force.

Saigon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - On the eve of its meeting, the All-India Congress Committee issued another statement, urging Britain to accept India's demand for independence. If a satisfactory response is not received, the Committee will expand the disobedience movement to restore India's freedom and independence. Once India declares independence, a provisional government will be established. At the same time, Iran and Iraq must also gain independence.

Stockholm, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - Sir Stafford Cripps' speech this morning attempted to divide Indian public opinion with threats and promises, in order to delay the disobedience movement that India will launch next week. Cripps first stated that Britain is prepared to renegotiate with Indian leaders to determine India's freedom after the war. After the war, Britain will grant India the government desired by the Indian people. However, before the end of the war, it is the British government's natural obligation to maintain freedom and law in India. Therefore, the British government will not allow any events to disrupt public order in India, especially in India's arms industry. The British government will take all measures to suppress such attempts.

Colombo (Ceylon), 5th (Hallett News Agency) - According to Reuters, political figures here are closely monitoring the development of the Indian political situation, believing that any major political changes in India will affect Ceylon, as the island is economically completely dependent on India.

Lisbon, 6th (Domei News Agency) - Britain's reaction to the situation in India is extremely serious. All newspapers advocate that no concessions should be made to India's demands, and no reconciliation is possible.

Bombay, 5th (Havas News Agency) - After the original text of Gandhi's proposal to the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress was published, the English-language *Times of India* was deeply shocked, stating that "after the publication of this document, anyone with common sense will no longer criticize Britain's unwillingness to entrust India's defense to Indian ministers." However, the Indian newspapers still criticized the British government's attitude. Among them, the *Bombay Chronicle* stated that the British government's publication of Gandhi's proposal only served to widen the gap between Britain and India. The *Bombay Free Press* stated that the British government was spreading rumors based on unfounded facts, and that it was truly inappropriate for the government to use police powers to hastily publish documents obtained through searches.

### Japanese Envoy Oshima Visits Krakow for Inspection

Krakow, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Saito and a secretary from the embassy, arrived here for a two-day visit.

Nanjing, 6th (Domei News Agency) - The press department of the Japanese Army stationed in China announced this afternoon that when Japanese Army aircraft launched a concentrated attack on Hengyang, a base in Hunan Province, yesterday, a fierce air battle occurred over the Hengyang airfield with American fighter planes, and nine American aircraft were shot down. The US Air Force's squadrons had recently arrived in Hengyang to reinforce the Chongqing squadrons, and the Japanese action has effectively preempted the other side's attempts to carry out aerial guerrilla warfare. One Japanese aircraft did not return to its base.

### Turkish Prime Minister Declares: Strict Neutrality Maintained; Friendship with Germany and Britain Unchanged; German Military Attaché to Turkey Recalled

Ankara, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu delivered a speech in parliament yesterday afternoon, elaborating on Turkey's domestic and foreign policy principles, stating that Turkey's ability to maintain its neutral position in the current complex and difficult international situation is due to the unity of the entire nation. There are no misunderstandings or conflicts within our country. The president and the people trust each other and work together to overcome difficulties. The main task of our government is to maintain the unity of the Turkish people and prevent the spread of war to Turkey. If, unfortunately, things do not go as desired and our country's territory and independence are violated, we will swear to protect freedom and independence and fight to the end against the aggressors. Our country's strong military force is for this purpose. Now, it is worth reviewing our foreign policy. Since the establishment of the Treaty of Lausanne, our country's foreign policy has entered its current stage. Turkey has never invaded others, nor does it want other countries' wars to spread to Turkey. Our neutrality is an active neutrality, not a passive one. Turkey's neutrality has developed within a sincere political system. Turkey's alliance with Britain benefits both sides, and the Treaty of Friendship further strengthens the friendly relations between the two countries. Our friendly relations with the two major warring powers are an example of our active neutrality policy. In short, the new government's foreign policy remains one of responding to friendship with friendship and to violence with force.

Istanbul, 5th (Havas News Agency) - It has been learned that the German Military Attaché to Turkey, General Rothe, has been recalled to Germany and is scheduled to leave the Turkish capital by plane on the morning of the 8th, returning to Berlin via here.

### Amidst Extreme Shortage of Raw Materials: Inside Information on the Masses; After Low Pricing of Mass Toothbrushes, Sales Will Reach 100,000 Sets

The Liangxinji Mass Toothbrush, recently priced low, comes in sets of two. The original price was four yuan per set, but it is now priced at only two yuan. At a time when toothbrush-making materials are extremely scarce and wages are high, only 100,000 sets of these low-priced Mass Toothbrushes are available. Once sold out, sales will cease. It has been found that the Liangxinji main and branch stores and department stores throughout the city will sell nearly 100,000 of these low-priced brushes. In addition, two-brush sets of medium-sized toothbrushes and three-brush sets of children's toothbrushes are priced at only one yuan and five cents each. Once sold out, sales will also cease.

### The Trend of the Entire World History: Clues May Be Revealed Within Three Months; Opening a Second Front Can No Longer Be Delayed; The Allies' Weakness Lies in the Lack of Unified Command

New York, 5th (Havas News Agency) - *The New York Post* published a dispatch from its Moscow correspondent today, stating, "Whether the Allies can win in the current war will be known in another forty days. If the German army occupies the Caucasus, not only will the Soviet Union suffer a blow, but Britain and the United States will also suffer adverse effects. With the Red Army's oil supply deprived and Hitler possessing a large amount of raw materials, the British and American blockade policy will be completely ineffective. Germany's success will deeply impress the countries of the Near East, and the world political situation will be changed accordingly. The only hope for Britain and the United States lies in taking immediate action, because if Britain and the United States have no Soviet Union as an ally in Europe, they cannot defeat Germany and Japan. Therefore, if the governments of Britain and the United States do not decide to open a second front immediately, the possibility of defeat in the next forty days will be 97%. However, at this moment, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. A large-scale action should be launched at the last moment."

Lyon, 5th (Havas News Agency) - American political commentators and historians have unanimously declared that the trend of the entire world history will be clearly revealed within the next ninety days. The press in Paris and here has refuted this prediction, stating that, in fact, no one knows whether the British and American forces will open a second front on the European continent in the coming weeks. Currently, due to military, political, and social reasons, all the Axis powers are unwilling to switch from defense to offense. However, everyone generally agrees that unified command is essential, because, militarily, victory or defeat does not depend entirely on the number of soldiers or the superiority of military equipment. The most important thing is the seamless cooperation of the commanders of each unit. Therefore, in modern warfare, military dictatorship is almost a necessary condition for victory, as evidenced by the last Great War in 1914. It was not until 1918 that the Allies decided on a unified command method. Today, the position of Britain and the United States is more dangerous than it was in 1918. Except at sea and on the Egyptian front, the British and American forces have not yet fought shoulder to shoulder against the Axis forces. But it is unimaginable that the Red Army General Staff would automatically accept orders from London and Washington. If so, the military dictator sought by the Allies would still only command a part of the Allied forces. Regarding this point, we are familiar with two great names, one being British General Wavell and the other being American General MacArthur. General Wavell has been repeatedly criticized in Britain and the United States, while General MacArthur has a distinguished record and has become the only famous general at present. In short, due to international suspicion and the difficulty of finding suitable candidates, unified command is not easily realized at this time.

Where Exactly Will the Second Front Be?

Washington, 5th (Havas News Agency) - *The New York Times* published an article today analyzing the current world situation, stating, "The second front may be opened in India. We must be prepared to receive bad news from India at the end of this week, as India is in a position where difficulties cannot be avoided. There are many conflicting opinions about opening a second front, but we must understand that the second front may be opened in India to disperse the Allied forces. The British government and Gandhi are still in a stalemate. If a solution cannot be found in the end, difficulties will inevitably arise. A civil war in India would be extremely unfortunate for the countries fighting for freedom. Not only would Britain's vital interests be affected, but the interests of the United States would also be at a critical juncture. However, at this moment, it is still possible to avoid tragedy. We hope that the proposal put forward by British Lord Privy Seal Cripps can obtain international guarantees and that India can accept it. Therefore, we must do everything possible to find a solution to this extremely difficult problem."

How Easy Is This Undertaking for Britain and the United States?

Berlin, 5th (Havas News Agency) - Officials here recently stated that it is absolutely impossible for Britain and the United States to use 8 to 9 million tons of ships to transport the troops needed to open a second front. A certain foreign wireless station claimed that the Allies need 15 million soldiers, 100,000 cannons, 85,000 tanks, and 50,000 aircraft to open a second front. How easy is this undertaking? To take a step back, even if the Soviet Union supplies three-quarters of the soldiers, Britain and the United States would still need to gather enough ships to transport 3 to 4 million soldiers. However, Britain and the United States currently do not have enough ships for this risky undertaking.

### British House of Commons Summer Recess

London, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The House of Commons will put to a vote this month the government's proposed date for the summer recess. Government representative, Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps, will speak to confirm that Prime Minister Churchill does not intend to issue any official report on the military situation before the House of Commons reconvenes. He stated that ministers must rest after the parliamentary discussions conclude, but if unexpected events occur during the recess, the House will reconvene at any time.

### German Aircraft Flies Over Iceland

Lisbon, 6th (Domei News Agency) - According to a communiqué from the US Army Headquarters in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, a German bomber flew over western Iceland east of Reykjavik on Tuesday morning, flying north and strafing the Grindavik lighthouse ten miles east of Hólmavík in northwestern Iceland with machine guns. On Wednesday morning, another enemy aircraft flew east along the southern coast of Iceland.

### US Government Orders Women to Register for Wartime Work

Lisbon, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - The US authorities have ordered all women aged 18 to 64 to register with the authorities in order to organize a reserve labor force. It is estimated that approximately 41 million women can be mobilized to serve in war-related work.

### Stalemate on the North African Front

Berlin, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command's communiqués and German newspapers have recently mentioned the North African battles very little. German war correspondent Beckman explained the reasons for the stalemate on that front, stating that General Rommel's current mission is to consolidate the areas already occupied, so the focus is on defense. Recently, the British Air Force has been very active in North Africa, carrying out large-scale air raids from time to time. Therefore, the British Air Force currently has a slight numerical advantage in that area compared to the Axis forces. When British bombers are dispatched, they are often protected by a large number of fighter planes. Recently, when the British Air Force bombed the North African front, 30 bombers were dispatched, with 50 fighter planes providing cover. Although the Royal Air Force has a numerical advantage, it has still failed to control the skies in that area. I once accompanied a reconnaissance plane on a flight to scout the vast area between the coast and the Qattara Depression, the Nile Delta, and El Alamein, and frequently encountered enemy aircraft. After my inspection, I felt that the British army still has considerable strength. The number of tanks and artillery concentrated in the El Alamein area is not small.

Stockholm, 6th (Domei News Agency) - According to reports from Cairo, the 6-pounder anti-tank guns used by the British Eighth Army on the El Alamein front are highly praised by military circles. The guns are mounted on armored vehicles, can move 35 miles per hour, and have a range of one mile.

### Uruguayan Foreign Minister to Visit the United States

Montevideo (Uruguay), 5th (Havas News Agency) - Foreign Minister Guani is rumored to be planning a visit to the United States. In response to reporters' questions, Minister Guani stated that he intends to visit the United States, but the departure date has not yet been determined. After arriving in the United States, he will discuss commercial and financial issues between the United States and Uruguay with the US authorities. In addition, he also plans to visit Chile in September.

### Summer Epidemic Prevention: Epidemics Often Caused by Careless Eating; Strengthening the Stomach and Intestines Can Reduce the Risk of Infection

Those annoying flies are swarming everywhere, and because they fly around, they lurk human life in every place. The most important intestinal diseases are: dysentery, typhoid fever, etc. If you are not careful, they will deprive you of your life. Therefore, the reason for the transmission of these diseases is mostly due to careless eating, which brings these dysentery bacteria, typhoid bacteria, etc., into the intestines, giving them the opportunity to breed and rage in the human body. Their symptoms are simply written below! "Cholera," commonly known as cholera, is the most terrible epidemic, which may end human life in a very short period of time! Mild cases are only vomiting and diarrhea a few times, headaches or dizziness, slight fatigue, and cold limbs, and can be cured in about a week, while severe cases are often fatal, with severe vomiting and excretion, sunken eye sockets, sunken fingers, pale face, thirst, hoarse voice, and spasms. However, people with weak bodies are more likely to suffer from this disease. If you take the body-strengthening and blood-boosting "Ruosu," your physique will become stronger, your resistance to bacteria will be stronger, and you will never suffer from this disease.

"Typhoid fever" usually lasts about four weeks. In the first week, appetite is poor, and there is fatigue and fever. In the second week, the temperature rises, around 39 to 40 degrees Celsius, with unclear consciousness, delirium, dry and dark tongue coating, and peeling of the tongue tip. This week is the most dangerous. If attention is not paid in the third week, such as intestinal ulcers, even bleeding and perforation, and the temperature drops, it is inevitable to die from collapse; but if the third week passes without this phenomenon, then the body temperature will return to normal after four weeks, and all symptoms will disappear? That is, they will gradually recover.

"Dysentery" is generally divided into red and white types, but red dysentery is more serious, and it is commonly called dysentery. Mild cases are similar to colitis, with severe abdominal pain, urgency and tenesmus during excretion, and mucus in the stool, but severe cases have ulcers in the intestines, with pus and blood in the stool, fatigue, listlessness, increased number of excretions, and often death.

Looking at the above three diseases, due to a moment of carelessness, great pain and even death are suffered. How can one not be vigilant? Therefore, the ancients said, "Disease enters through the mouth, and disaster comes from the mouth." This is indeed true, but dietary prudence cannot be guaranteed. Now, there is a savior. More reliable and convenient than getting a vaccination is the most famous "Ruosu." It is the most reliable and safest preventive medicine. If you do not want to suffer from disease, then hurry up and take this great Ruosu. "Ruosu" contains Vitamin B, powerful digestive enzymes, hormones... etc., so it has special effects.

### Fifth Column Conspiracy in Soviet Union Exposed

Stockholm, 5th (Havas News Agency) - According to reports from Moscow, the Fifth Column is quite active in the Soviet Union. A major anti-communist conspiracy case was discovered in Leningrad last winter, and the inside story was only revealed today. The initiators of the conspiracy were Vasilyev, a former White Russian officer, and Myukolov, a former official of the St. Petersburg District Court. They called on their accomplices to commit various acts of aiding the enemy, compiling a list of Communist Party members and important Soviet figures for delivery when the German army entered the city. They also forged food ration cards to deplete the city's scarce food supplies. Moreover, these people colluded with German officers. The German High Command dropped several instructions behind the Red Army lines by parachute. Another group of spies disguised themselves as refugees and infiltrated the city from nearby villages. At the same time, several spies, originally known for their anti-Soviet stance, suddenly volunteered to the authorities to join the militia and requested firearms, arousing the authorities' suspicion. Later, the police discovered a secret radio station being used by spies dressed in Red Army uniforms, and the truth was revealed. In addition, Vasilyev and others incited party members to join various Soviet agencies in order to do their best to undermine the Soviet political system. For example, an engineer who joined the rebel party transformed himself into a Communist Party member.

### The Caucasus Front Enters a Decisive Phase: Key Railway Hub Occupied by Germany; Battle Situation on the Don River Stabilizing

Havas News Agency, From a location on the Ukrainian border, the 6th: The battle of the Caucasus seems to have entered a decisive phase. German forces have reached the Kuban River along a 35-mile front between Voroshilovgrad and Armavir. The Tikhoretsk-Armavir-Nevinomyssk railway is within range of German artillery. Despite valiant resistance from the Red Army in the Manych River marsh area, German forces have reached the terminus of the Tikhoretsk-Kropotkin railway and are now advancing south towards the lower reaches of the Kalaus River. Intense fighting is taking place between the Manych and Don River basins. German forces advancing from Kotelnikovo and Iljinka towards the Salsk-Stalingrad railway have successfully broken through to the southwest, creating a wide gap in the Soviet line. Unconfirmed reports indicate that German forces reached the Kalaus River this afternoon. Given the large number of soldiers involved and the intensity of the fighting, a large-scale offensive is believed to be underway with Astrakhan as the primary target, with only a natural barrier preventing the enemy from attacking from the west.

Transocean News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The German High Command announced this afternoon that German forces in the Kuban region have occupied the railway hub of Tikhoretsk. Several infantry divisions are advancing south, with support from armored vehicles attacking across the Kuban River to expand bridgehead fortifications. South of Voroshilovgrad, German forces quickly crossed the Kuban River, cutting off the railway connecting the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. North of the Sal River, German and Romanian forces have made good progress. There has been fierce fighting in the great bend of the Don River. Twenty-five Soviet tanks were destroyed. Yesterday, 108 Soviet aircraft were shot down over the Eastern European theater, with six German aircraft missing.

Havas News Agency, Bern, 5th: The Basler Nachrichten's war correspondent on the Eastern Front reports that the Red Army is currently defending the northeastern bridgehead of the Don River bend with desperate courage. Although the Red Army failed to hold strategic positions near the town of Tsimlyanskaya on the west bank of the Don River, their continued resistance in the northeastern bend may delay the German advance on the city. The current Red Army positions are located near Kletskaya, north of Kalach. Despite repeated German attacks in recent days, they have been unable to break through the Red Army's heavily fortified trenches.

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 5th: According to a Moscow dispatch, the Soviet Information Bureau announced at midnight on the 5th that German forces in the Tsimlyanskaya area, overcoming fierce Red Army resistance, crossed the Don River with a large force and arrived at Kotelnikovo. Fighting is still ongoing in the area. This is the first time Kotelnikovo has appeared in the Soviet Information Bureau's communiqués. The location is 140 kilometers south of Stalingrad and is a key point on the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway. If German forces cut the railway at this location, Stalingrad would face a major threat from the south.

### German Forces Advance Rapidly Southward in Three Directions: Reports of Armored Vanguard Reaching Foothills

Havas News Agency, Rome, 5th: An Italian war correspondent has cabled from the Eastern Front that Soviet resistance has been broken by German encirclement tactics. The remnants defending the Kuban are caught between German artillery fire and the Black Sea, with their situation precarious. Their only hope lies in a rapid retreat to Novorossiysk and Tuapse for embarkation or landing in Batumi, transferring to Tbilisi and Baku. However, given the superior strength of the German air force, such a retreat would be highly dangerous. Otherwise, the army can only flee into the deep mountains, in which case it will not be able to continue organized resistance. Roman sources say that German forces are advancing in three directions: the first towards Maykop and Tuapse; the second towards Belorechenskaya, possibly to advance to the Grozny oilfields; and the third towards Krasnodar and Novorossiysk, to cut off the Soviet retreat.

Transocean News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The vanguard of German armored units reached the foothills of the Caucasus yesterday. The superiority of German armored vehicles and aircraft is becoming increasingly evident. The command of the area between the Don River and the Caucasus is in German hands. Transport lines and railway networks near Stalingrad and southeast of Armavir are being heavily bombed, making it difficult for Soviet forces to transport reinforcements and supplies. German forces have occupied Kropotkin and established bridgehead fortifications on the west bank of the Kuban River, and have almost crossed the aforementioned point. To avoid enemy intelligence gathering, the German High Command often delays the announcement of occupied locations by 24 to 48 hours. Currently, the Soviet forces under the command of General Timoshenko in northern Caucasus only have one railway line connecting to southern Caucasus, and the railways to the north, east, and Caspian Sea have already been cut off. The double-track railway from Rostov to Baku has been bombed by German aircraft.

Transocean News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German forces have occupied Kropotkin, a railway hub through which the Rostov-Baku railway and the Voroshilovgrad-Novorossiysk railway pass. The city has a population of 50,000, and was renamed in 1920 to commemorate the anarchist government figure Kropotkin. The city has a vegetable oil factory and canning factories for meat and fruit.

### Battle for Oil Resources Rages: Soviet Union Calls on Military and Civilians to Defend the Country

Havas News Agency, Bern, 5th: The Lausanne Gazette reports that the battle for oil resources in the Caucasus is raging. This campaign is of great importance, as the Caucasus produces 90% of the Soviet Union's total oil production, with oilfields located in Maykop, Grozny, and Baku. German forces are currently advancing towards Maykop. Of the three oil-producing regions, Baku and the Apsheron Peninsula are the most important. Last year, Baku alone produced 22 million tons out of the Soviet Union's total oil production of 34 million tons, Grozny produced 3 million or 4 million tons, and Maykop only produced 1.5 million tons. Therefore, the battle for oil resources will end with the capture of Baku, which is currently 700 miles from the front lines.

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 5th: The Moscow radio station broadcast the Red Army's war report today, which was characteristically brief, stating only that "In the past 24 hours, our forces have engaged in fierce fighting in the areas of Keteskaya, Belaya Glina, and Koshevskaya." At the same time, TASS issued a message stating that artillery battles occurred near Voronezh and on the Volkhov front. The situation on the southern front is "tense," but the Red Army is putting up strong resistance and has inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In addition, Pravda published an article today, once again urging the military and civilians to work together to defend the country, stating that "We must stop the enemy's advance and drive them out of the Kuban region. At this moment, our country has become a great military bastion, and the strictest discipline must be implemented. No soldier should retreat on his own initiative unless he has received an order from above."

### Nazi Forces Launch Large-Scale Encirclement Operation Against Stalingrad

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 6th: The German military's summer offensive has reached its 40th day. According to open admissions from the Mosley camp, the situation on the southern front is becoming increasingly unfavorable, except for the stabilization of the Don River's situation. The easternmost corner of that front, the port of Yeysk on the Azov coast, is in imminent danger. The Soviet naval fleet stationed in the Sea of Azov, which consisted of about 70 warships of various types at the beginning of the German summer offensive, is now in a difficult situation. Although several of these warships have been sunk by German aircraft, the only way for the remaining ships is to escape through the Kerch Strait, but this proposal is very dangerous. The vanguard of the German forces in the central sector, after breaking through the Red Army's defense lines, has now reached the eastern and western suburbs of Armavir. The Maykop oil-producing area is under direct threat. On the Volga River front, German forces have launched a large-scale encirclement operation and are flanking the river's defenses. The German authorities are remaining silent about the progress, but it is expected that there will be military developments in that area. In order to defend Stalingrad and prevent it from being threatened by this encirclement operation, the Soviet side may voluntarily abandon its positions on the right bank of the Don River and retreat to Stalingrad, so as to defend the city on both its western and southern sides. As a result, the German offensive against Stalingrad is now worthy of renewed attention. German paratroopers, in teams of 100 or 150, carrying machine guns, mortars, and small tanks, have landed in that area. The Soviet military authorities are becoming increasingly anxious about this.

### Former U.S. Air Force Commander Arrives in Moscow, Hand-Delivers Roosevelt's Personal Letter

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 5th: According to a Moscow dispatch, former U.S. Air Force Commander General Brett flew to Moscow from Washington on the 5th and immediately met with Stalin to present Roosevelt's personal letter. It is said that his trip is related to strengthening American material assistance to the Soviet Union, and he had discussions with Stalin. Roosevelt's dispatch of Brett to Moscow is expected to be due to the Soviet Union's extreme dissatisfaction with Britain and the United States regarding the issue of opening a second front. Therefore, the effects of Brett's visit to the Soviet Union are questionable. Also, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union flew to Moscow from Kuybyshev on the 5th.

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 6th: According to various newspapers, British Prime Minister Churchill's current visit to the Soviet Union is to Moscow, not the former Soviet wartime capital of Kuybyshev. This can be confirmed by the fact that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Kerr has also arrived in Moscow.

### British Admiralty Establishes Assistant Secretary

Havas News Agency, London, 5th: Navy Minister Alexander recently announced in the House of Commons that the government has appointed Candith-Pole-Carew as Assistant Secretary to the Admiralty. As Admiralty affairs have become increasingly complex recently, the Assistant Secretary is specially appointed to oversee various staff tasks and handle matters such as military supplies and personnel training, so that the Minister himself can have more time to study strategic issues.

### German Army, Navy, and Air Force in Western Europe Practice Coastal Defense Warfare

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 5th: The German News Agency issued a message saying that the German army, navy, and air force conducted exercises today in the fortified areas of the French coast of the English Channel. Foreign correspondents went to observe and witnessed various specific constructions inside, which were protected by anti-aircraft artillery and naval and army artillery, and were extremely strong. The theme of this exercise was that if the enemy attempted to land on the coast of the French-occupied area, a warning would be issued immediately, and the heavy artillery would begin shelling after 80 seconds. The assault troops immediately occupied the machine gun positions, and at the same time, flat-shooting guns, flame throwers, and various new German military equipment were also dispatched to participate in the coastal defense warfare. The results of the exercise were good, which confirmed the consolidation of the defenses in the area.

### Soviet Generals Promoted

Allied News Agency, Moscow, 6th: Red Army commanders Volkogonchuk and Shlemin were promoted to Lieutenant Generals of the Artillery, and 33 others were promoted to Major Generals.

### Allied Merchant Ships Sunk Fourteen

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 5th: According to an official announcement, our fleet has sunk four enemy warships and eleven merchant ships in the past 24 hours.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 5th: The Navy Department issued a communiqué stating that a British cargo ship of ordinary tonnage was sunk by a submarine in the Caribbean Sea in the middle of last month. The rescued crew members have landed at a port in the eastern United States.

### Random Notes on the Nile (Part 1)

The North African part of the World War has spread from the fall of Tobruk, Libya, to the ancient land of Egypt with its five thousand years of brilliant culture. In the scorching desert sun, both sides use tank armies equipped with air conditioning to charge into battle. Although it is temporarily impossible to determine who will win, it is considered to be a sufficiently fierce scene in the clashes in the Near East. For Britain, the importance of Alexandria may not exceed that of Singapore. Even if the Axis forces cross the Nile, occupy Cairo, and knock directly on the Suez Canal's gates, it is possible as an "offensive," but allowing the troops to pass through the Red Sea and head directly to Saudi Arabia, Iran, Persia, and the Transcaucasus may not be what the British are willing to do. Therefore, as far as the war situation is concerned, the North African war is not about the gains and losses of the mainland, but about preventing the Axis forces from advancing into the Near East. The Axis forces' advance in the summer is aimed at protecting the rich oil mines of Saudi Arabia and Iran, and they also want to connect with the German forces fighting in southern Russia through the Transcaucasus, which is also very obvious.

In fact, the analysis of the war situation is still a scholar's old habit, talking about war on paper, and may not be as accurate as General Rommel's secret plan. Instead, the current battle for the desert, the gains and losses of the oasis, are what attract our attention. Speaking of Egypt, it reminds our country of the Nile River, which is more than 3,600 miles long, and like the Don River in the Soviet Union, it can no longer flow quietly, and it is expected that it will cause surging waves. Therefore, we are preparing to introduce some of the Nile's scenery at this time, for the readers who are concerned about the non-war affairs to talk about.

The first major city the Nile flows into after entering Egypt is called Aswan. The nearby villages still maintain the life of the ancient monarch era, and are completely isolated from the outside world. Small islands line the river, with strange rocks and ruggedness. The two banks are endless yellow sand, and the black color of the island stones is a clear contrast. The leaves of the palm trees emerge from the water surface. Whenever the fruits are ripe, when the boat passes by, you can easily pick fresh fruits.

The water level here is higher, and a village has been submerged by floods. Sitting in the boat, you can see the narrow streets below, the roofs of the farmers' houses, the courtyards built with walls, and the spires of the mosques, which have already touched the bottom of the boat. The Aswan Dam prevents the river water from advancing, so that the submerged village will have a day to see the sun again. The government often buys this fertile land and moves those homeless black people to Egypt to cultivate the land. But they are willing to live on the border and build new villages on the high ground of the desert.

The Aswan Dam is unfavorable to the southern region, but it is of great benefit to the fields in Egypt. In ancient times, Egypt was either flooded or drought. Now that the dam has been set up, floods still occur occasionally, but there is no drought. The grains can be irrigated all year round, thanks to the Aswan Dam.

The dam is built of granite, and looks like a long wall, magnificent and strong, and seems to be stronger than the limestone of the pyramids. Perhaps in decades, this dam will become the main antiquity of Egypt. The dam is one and a quarter miles long and has 180 sluice gates. These many sluice gates are the savior of Egypt.

Aswan is an important town in southern Egypt. Explorers from Egypt have called it the Elephant Country, because they first saw African elephants in this place. Stepping into the city of Aswan and looking at the scenery in the river, it is very moving. On the deep blue river, white sails are floating everywhere. The crystal clear rocks of the First Cataract look like they have been coated with a layer of enamel, like fresh oil paint newly applied this morning. The distant islands are scattered, which can be regarded as gems in the Nile River. Looking at the peaks of the Libyan mountains, a white tomb of the chieftain stands in the blue sky, and the slope at the foot of the mountain is a golden sandy land.

Nearby is Kitchener's Island, which is where the late Sir Kitchener prepared to spend his years after retirement. Unfortunately, Sir Kitchener died early and did not achieve his ambition of living in seclusion. In order to commemorate Sir Kitchener's achievements, the government authority not only named the island after Sir Kitchener, but also planted exotic flowers and plants all over the island. The fragrance of flowers continues throughout the year, especially rich in roses, because Sir Kitchener's hobby was gardening such as planting bamboo and cutting flowers.

### Temperature 103.6 Degrees - Strict Epidemic Prevention Measures Implemented Today - Houses Where Cholera Occurs Will Be Locked Down - All Districts May Simultaneously Check Vaccination Certificates - If the Epidemic Continues to Rage, All Swimming Pools Will Be Closed

Since being hit by a heat wave, the temperature in this city has increased further yesterday, and the whole city is in turmoil. The temperature rose to 103.3 degrees the day before yesterday, which was the highest heat since the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Unexpectedly, the temperature increased further yesterday, reaching a maximum of 103.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

The two concession health departments gave a total of 53,756 cholera vaccinations to citizens the day before yesterday, of which 30,726 were vaccinated in the Public Concession, and the remaining 23,030 were all residents of the French Concession. The Public Works Department also revealed that it received 35 reports of cholera cases on this day, and nine of them had died. In the French Concession, 17 cases were discovered, with a total of two deaths.

Talk by the Japanese Marine Corps Authorities

According to the Domei News Agency, the Japanese Marine Corps authorities issued a statement on the 3rd of this month, clarifying the future epidemic prevention measures and precautions that citizens should take. It was decided that specific implementation would begin on the 7th. Recently, a supplementary explanation was issued, hoping that citizens will pay attention to it together. The general idea of ​​his speech is recorded as follows:

Our Marine Corps issued a statement on August 3, clarifying future epidemic prevention guidelines and precautions, which will be specifically implemented from tomorrow (7th). Now, a supplementary explanation is specially added, hoping that everyone will pay attention to it together.

Regarding the Blockade of Houses Where Cholera Occurs: Isolating the infected house from the outside world when an infectious disease occurs is absolutely necessary to prevent the spread of the source of infection. When an infectious disease occurs, among those who live in the same house and dine together with the patient, there must be carriers of bacteria. Moreover, these carriers are extremely healthy and have strong physical strength. Therefore, if these people are allowed to go out freely, they will spread bacteria everywhere. If others accidentally ingest the bacteria, they are prone to illness. If this point is ignored, even if strict epidemic prevention is implemented in other aspects, it will be in vain. This is the reason for blocking houses where cholera occurs, but this type of blockade is completely different in purpose from a blockade when a terror incident occurs. The method adopted for epidemic prevention and blockade is as follows:

A. The blockade of houses is limited to the building where cholera occurs and its directly adjacent buildings, and the scope is determined at any time depending on the local conditions. B. Food and daily necessities can be sent in from the outside, but items in the house must not be taken out. It is hoped that the Baojia personnel will exert the spirit of mutual assistance in the Baojia system and pay attention to the careful delivery of food, etc. C. The disposal of feces and urine in the isolated houses is extremely troublesome. It must be fully disinfected by the Public Works Department before it can be moved out of the house.

As mentioned above, when implementing the lockdown for epidemic prevention, the people in the locked area, in addition to staying at home, can be free from major pain. It is hoped that all sectors will thoroughly understand this point and must not conceal the matter. Otherwise, once discovered, severe punishment will be imposed. At this time, not only will they suffer great pain, but they should also be held responsible for not cooperating with the epidemic prevention of all citizens of Shanghai.

Regarding the Inspection of Vaccination Certificates: The effective period of cholera vaccination is about three months, so those who were vaccinated before May should be vaccinated again this time. In order to thoroughly vaccinate, the vaccination certificates issued by the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee will be checked at a certain sentry line, or inspections will be started simultaneously at indefinite times and places. At that time, even those who have been vaccinated but do not carry their certificates will be prohibited from passing. Therefore, you must carry your certificate with you when going out. In addition, certificates before May 1, 1931, are invalid in August, and certificates before June 1 are invalid until September.

Regarding the Early Detection of Cholera Patients: Early detection of patients not only benefits the patients themselves, but also helps others. The main symptoms of cholera are as follows: A. Diarrhea and vomiting; the feces are milky. B. Dehydration of the body; the cheekbones and nasal bones of the face protrude quite high. C. Low body temperature and cold limbs. D. The patient feels tired all over, has no appetite, and has mild abdominal pain.

The symptoms of cholera are roughly as above. In addition to paying attention to it yourself, you must also pay attention to your family members and neighbors from time to time so that patients can be discovered early and receive treatment. It is hoped that the above items will be relayed to all sectors for thorough and full understanding.

Houses with Epidemics Locked Down for Five Days

In view of the prevalence of cholera, the French authorities, with the consent of the Public Concession authorities and the Epidemic Prevention Committee, decided to strengthen various epidemic prevention measures. Houses where cholera is discovered should be locked down for five days. During the lockdown period, no one may enter or leave. The residents of the locked area will have their food supplied and subsidized by the Baojia in the area. The Health Department and the Cleansing Garbage Department of the Municipal Council shall be responsible for disposing of corpses, disinfecting houses, and removing garbage and feces, respectively.

For the sake of public health, the above measures are obviously necessary, but inconveniences to residents will be minimized when implemented. In addition, the French authorities specially reminded the public to pay attention to the provisions of Article 95 of the health regulations, which stipulates that epidemic prevention vaccination can be enforced during wartime and epidemic periods. The French Consul General's Office, upon the request of the Health Department, has issued an order stipulating that everyone must be vaccinated against epidemics at present. If anyone refuses to be vaccinated, they will be punished according to current laws without leniency.

Epidemic Prevention Situation in the French Concession

The spread of cholera in the French Concession was not very rampant at first. Although the situation should be considered serious, it can still be completely controlled. To date, there have only been 120 cases of true cholera, of which 14 were not residents of the concession, but were admitted to the isolation hospital in the French Concession. A total of 23 people died, accounting for 17% of the total. As for the entire city of Shanghai, 1,300 people have contracted cholera, and 220 people have died as a result, with a mortality rate of 17%. Therefore, the situation in this concession is better. The French Concession has adopted strict military epidemic prevention work to prevent the spread of immune areas. About 23,000 people are vaccinated against epidemics every day. To date, the total number of injections administered is 955,000. Residents' drinking water is strictly managed. All Chinese wells are disinfected with a large amount of Chaumel water on a regular basis. All cleaning measures are available, and the site where cholera is discovered must be strictly disinfected and the area locked down to eliminate it. The Baojia personnel will find ways to maintain the supply of food and clothing in the area. Although the implementation of various methods will inevitably cause inconvenience to residents, residents need to accept it for the benefit of the public. The hospital situation in this concession is quite satisfactory. In addition to 110 beds in the isolation hospital dedicated to treating cholera patients, there are another 200 beds with the same equipment as the hospital, which can be used if the existing hospital is insufficient.

Patients Should Be Sent to Isolation Hospitals

The Public Works Department Information Office issued an announcement saying, "It has been found that private hospitals in the Public Concession are not allowed to admit cholera patients. The public has been notified in the past. If citizens have cholera, they should immediately be sent to any of the following isolation hospitals for treatment: Chinese Isolation Hospital, 162 North Sea Road; Chinese Isolation Hospital, 1461 Xin Guan Road; Chinese Isolation Hospital, 9 Singapore Road; Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, 25 Chu Qiaqing Road; True Heart Cholera Hospital, 252 Tianjin Road.

Cholera Source Is Actually Nanshi

The English-language North China Daily News said that the newly appointed Director of Health of the Public Works Department, Dr. Tadashiro Ryo, met with reporters this morning (the 6th) and said that the sanitary conditions in Shanghai are unsatisfactory and there is much room for improvement. Mr. Yu claimed that he is now responsible for public health and that the first goal is to cooperate closely with the Central China Epidemic Prevention Committee to do his best to curb the cholera epidemic in this city. Mr. Yu believes that Nanshi is the real source of the epidemic. All parts of the area are quite dirty. The Public Concession and the French Concession are responsible for the prevalence of cholera and the Chinese from Nanshi should bear the main responsibility. If the cholera epidemic continues to spread at the current rapid rate, more stringent measures will have to be taken in the concessions, and every citizen has an urgent need for vaccination.

Last Resort May Be to Ban Swimming

Regarding the rumor that the Hongkou Swimming Pool may be closed, no definite decision has been made yet. However, the health authorities are currently closely studying the conditions of various swimming pools and the possibility of spreading epidemic bacteria in the water. If the epidemic continues to rage, all swimming pools here will need to be closed. However, this is the last resort. At present, because the heat wave has not subsided, each swimming pool will be allowed to open if it maintains sufficient cleanliness.

Gutters and Toilets Should Be Rectified

The three main problems in Shanghai are drinking water, food, and gutter equipment. The gutter equipment in this city is poor, and strict measures must be taken in this regard. The drinking water system is also not very good. Another point that should also be noted is public toilets. Public toilets should be added to avoid feces and dirt on the streets. In short, there are many problems that are being gradually resolved so that Shanghai can become one of the healthiest cities.

### Xinning Shao Ship - Resuming Navigation Between Shanghai and Ningbo - First Sailing to Ningbo on the 12th

### French Authorities Strictly Investigate and Punish - Shortage of Food Rations - Deduct Weight Using Extremely Simple Tricks - 15 Rice Stores Fined

The French Police Department's Weights and Measures Inspection has recently been paying attention to the fraudulent and irregular behavior of retail rice stores. The tricks of these people are very simple: they require small movements to make the lost rice fall into the rice measuring container and not be easily seen by customers. Although the amount of rice obtained in this way is not much, it is still considerable due to the large number of customers, and it constitutes fraudulent behavior. Monitor the sale of measuring instruments

Especially the working class, suffers the most. The inspection department sends personnel to monitor each rice store every morning, as that is when transactions are busiest. The results of the monitoring were very good. On the first day, it was discovered that seven rice stores were selling less rice to customers. Subsequently, five, two, and one store were found to have irregular behavior on various days. Within four days, a total of 15 rice stores were found to be in violation of the law and were fined according to the severity of the circumstances, with the highest being 3,000 gold. It seems that the French Police Department's actions have yielded good results, as no irregular behavior of this kind has been discovered all day yesterday.

### Eradicate Fleas: A Simplest Method

Mosquitoes, flies, bedbugs, and fleas infest everywhere in the summer, spreading infectious diseases, which is truly annoying. To get rid of mosquitoes, flies, and bedbugs, in addition to gauze windows and fly swatters, there are various "special effect" powders and solutions sold on the market. However, when it comes to fleas, there is ultimately no good method.

Six Difficulties in Eradicating Them

Biology or entomology tells us that fleas, like other insects, undergo complete metamorphosis: from eggs hatching into larvae, growing into silk-spinning cocoons, pupating, and then maturing into adults. But in reality, aside from those who specialize in this field, who has ever seen flea eggs, larvae, pupae, or cocoons? Even the adults might sometimes be mistaken for specks of coal ash by those with poor eyesight! Due to their small size and difficulty in spotting them, this is the first difficulty we face in attempting to eradicate them.

Mosquitoes hide and appear at night; passively, one can simply hide inside a mosquito net to survive the night. Even if attacked, one can calmly respond and unexpectedly deliver a "Mount Tai pressing down" strike, and they will have a hard time escaping. There is also no need for extraordinary tactics to capture bedbugs alive; if one is willing to sacrifice sweet dreams and immediately pursue and encircle them upon discovery, they will inevitably surrender. As for fleas, it is not so easy; they are the ancestors of guerrilla tactics, with no fixed nests or times of activity, making it impossible for us to encircle or defend against them. This is the second difficulty we face in attempting to eradicate them.

When we are awake, mosquitoes and bedbugs are not entirely fearless, but fleas, skilled in using mobile warfare, are different. Even if you are awkwardly entangled in your trouser legs, they can calmly bite you before leaving. At this point, don't even think about capturing them alive; you probably don't even have the qualifications to track and pursue them! If they switch to night raid tactics, they are even more tireless because even if you discover them and angrily deliver a "Five Dragons Emerging from the Sea" strike, you will only suffer the pain of a slap, without harming the flea in the slightest. They come and go without a trace, which is the third difficulty we face in attempting to eradicate them.

Fleas can not only jump very high and far, but to adapt to the environment, their bodies are vertically flattened (exactly the opposite of bedbugs), their bodies are thick and tough, and their hind legs are very elastic. Therefore, even if you accidentally press or catch them during the day, they can still escape death at the last moment. How many tens of millions of fleas escape death every year? It is not easy to catch them, and it is not easy to kill them once caught. This is the fourth difficulty we face in attempting to eradicate them.

There are more than 400 species of fleas, the most common being human fleas, cat fleas, and dog fleas, and the most terrifying being the Indian rat flea. If there are no cats in the house, there will be rats. Once there are domestic animals, fleas are inevitable. Cat fleas are different from bedbugs on the bed; we cannot soak them in boiling water, nor can we spray overly strong insecticides. Cutting grass cannot remove the roots, and there are also concerns when killing fleas. This is the fifth difficulty we face in attempting to eradicate them.

Even if we keep our indoor environment absolutely clean, with not a speck of dust, and do not raise poultry or livestock, and thank God that even rats do not visit our homes, it is difficult to say that there are permanently and absolutely no fleas because we inevitably come into contact with others, take public transportation, and enter public places. Because the scope is extremely wide, there are many opportunities for transmission. This is the sixth difficulty we face in attempting to eradicate them.

The Simplest Method to Eliminate Fleas

With the above six difficulties, humans, hailed as the spirit of all things, may be helpless against these small creatures in today's era of scientific prosperity! Because active eradication relies on collective action, which is such a difficult public undertaking to achieve. Moreover, their hosts will never be eliminated. Fortunately, ordinary fleas, in situations where rodents and domestic animals are not ill, do not cause widespread harm or poison living beings. If we can passively capture and kill them, it may still be somewhat helpful.

One morning, the author discovered a phenomenon but dared not believe it. After repeated experiments, it was proven that what was seen was not an accidental phenomenon but a method that could be utilized. Therefore, I started researching and improving it, with the principles of being economical, simple, not hindering hygiene, and not being dangerous, so that women, children, and those with nothing to their name could all apply it according to the method. After more than a month of research, I am quite satisfied. I am publishing the method here, hoping that readers will try it tonight and widely disseminate it.

Method: Use a white rectangular enamel basin (i.e., a teacup basin), fill it with half an inch of water, and place it on the floor at night. The next morning, there will be fleas floating on the water surface, which can be caught and crushed to death one by one.

The method is that simple; isn't it effortless? But before it was discovered, there was no way to deal with them. Since this method was discovered, five or six hundred fleas have been my experimental subjects. Although it is passive, reducing one flea means eliminating one harm and reducing one opportunity for epidemic transmission. It doesn't cost money or effort, so I think readers will be happy to accept it. (Zhuo)

### Vegetable Vendors' Scales Short Weight: Police Request Severe Punishment; Cheating the Poor Is a More Serious Crime

The Shanghai Times reported that detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police decided to eliminate profiteering merchants and arrested six vegetable vendors from the Aierjin Road vegetable market in the early hours for using scales that were short by one to five taels when selling vegetables, deceiving the public. When the Special District Court opened the trial yesterday (the 5th) morning, all the vegetable vendors pleaded guilty. When the police lawyer prosecuted, he said that those who were deceived by the defendants were not rich people, but poor people who barely had enough to make ends meet. Therefore, the defendants' crimes were more serious and he requested severe punishment. The case is scheduled to be sentenced next week.

### Letter

To the editor of your esteemed newspaper: Several points in the item regarding the theft case at our factory published in your newspaper on the 4th of this month need to be corrected. 1. Mr. Gao Jiesong is the manager of our factory, not Gao Jisong. 2. This theft case was committed by apprentices in our factory workshop. 3. Chen Asi, Wu Liekang (mistakenly written as Wu Zhizhang), and Xu Hefu (mistakenly written as Xu Rufu) are also apprentices in our factory workshop, not staff members. We hope that the above points will be corrected. Sincerely, Meixin Bakelite Manufacturing Factory, August 5th.

Correction

In the public notice of condolences for Ding Shouhe published in this newspaper on the 4th of this month, the Central Pharmacy was mistakenly listed as having sent 100 yuan. It was actually the Sino-British Pharmacy. We hereby urgently correct this.

Commercial News

### Continuous Decline in Stock Prices Triggers Buying Activity; Yongchang Xingye Relocates for Business

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation changed from uncertain weakness to suddenly firming around 10 o'clock. This was because the recent decline was too great, triggering buying activity. Although the Chinese Securities Building is still in a period of disinfection and closure, Yongchang Stock Company has set up a temporary office at Room 607, 6th Floor, No. 24 Central Road, telephone 10904. Xingye has also temporarily borrowed No. 3 Tao Mi Lane, Jiujiang Road, telephone 95028, for business. The market price was stabilized as a result. However, according to the noon price, compared with the previous day, cultural stocks such as Commercial Press and Zhonghua each fell by a small five yuan, while Shijie fell by a low of two and a half yuan. In the department store industry, China Underwear was the only one to see a rebound of half a yuan. Yong'an Company fell by five yuan, and Xinxin fell slightly by half a yuan, without shaking the stable trend. New pharmaceutical company Xinya rebounded by half a yuan, and there was buying activity. Zhongfa has stabilized, cutting down by one yuan. Minyi experienced a selling trend, cutting a huge five yuan, which was the only stock that rose two yuan the previous day. Da Zhonghua Match and Nanyang Tobacco each fell by two and a half yuan. Zhabei Water and Electricity remained flat, China Electric fell by one yuan, and the rest remained stable. According to all parties, people's hearts have turned to prosperity. The stock market price list for each stock is recorded below.

The selling price per tael in the cash market also dropped by a small 50 yuan, to 2,100 yuan, and the purchase price was listed at 1,900 yuan, still higher than the inter-dealer price by more than 50 yuan. The mystery in this is still difficult for outsiders to understand. The initial inter-dealer price was 20 yuan lower, calculated at 1,875 yuan. Suddenly, there were no buyers in very few transactions, and the price continued to fall. At noon, 1,850 yuan, a small call of 15 yuan lower than the previous day, with a difference of 25 yuan. Transactions were scarce. Later, sellers appeared at 1,820 yuan. As for jewelry silver, it was still listed at 16 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price was around 11 yuan.

### Sparse Settlement Day, Military Ticket Price Slightly Lower

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The price of Japanese military tickets slightly decreased due to the scarcity of settlement items and an oversupply among dealers. The initial price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 1 li, and it was seen to decline. At 11:45, it retreated to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, 7, and 8 li, a small reduction of half a fen compared to the previous day. Banks and small money shops still had to sell at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 2, and 3 li, and the purchase price was pulled back to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, 4, and 5 li, which was also seen to decline.

The cigarette market is trending hot and solid. As for the selling prices of British and American goods, there are ups and downs. Japanese cigarettes such as Jinqiang, Pi Er, and Si Ge are in strong demand in various rural areas. Buying and selling among dealers is quite prosperous, so the price is gradually increasing. Domestic cigarettes are stable, without much glory or disgrace. For example, Great Britain brand is 8,250 yuan, Old Knife brand is 5,250 yuan, Pinhai brand is 4,500 yuan, and Wuhua brand is 3,200 yuan, which are all 50 yuan higher than the previous day. Fairy brand is 3,600 yuan, falling by more than 100 yuan. Japanese cigarettes such as Jinqiang Pi Er are 1,550 yuan, Jinda Lou brand is 1,900 yuan, and Red Rose brand is 1,150 yuan, lacking supply.

### Yantai Dried Shrimp, Not Yet Sales Season

A batch of large Yantai dried shrimp has recently arrived, but because it is not yet the sales season, there are very few buyers, and the weather is too hot, so there is a slight odor, making it even more difficult to get a price. Therefore, although the asking price is still cheap, there has not been a transaction.

### Guzhen Melon Seed Production Area Listed, Shanghai Market Acquisition Still Awaits

According to yesterday's news flash, new Guzhen melon seeds have been listed sporadically, but the price is still high, requiring 400 yuan in new currency per day's weight, which is still difficult to match the taste of the Shanghai market. All lines are waiting for the change in the subsequent market before planning to acquire.

Spring and Autumn

### Anti-Epidemic Team

— Cheng Ren

"Shanghai has become a tiger epidemic area!" There are tiger castigations, but no one fears tiger castigations.

The doctors giving vaccinations on the streets should be as crowded as stores during a big sale, but "Old Shanghai" knows which streets to take to avoid these white-clothed envoys.

However, to obtain an "identity card," one must first have an anti-epidemic certificate, and then prove one's identity. This is what causes anxiety. Those without anti-epidemic certificates "think of ways" (and "thinking of ways" still means avoiding injections). Those who somehow obtained one in the past discover that it has already expired by three months.

So everyone goes to the health department for "vaccinations"!

At the border between the two concessions, anti-epidemic certificates are checked. Those without anti-epidemic certificates are not "begged" for a shot, but rather "not allowed to pass," which is a greater penalty.

So everyone goes to the health department for "vaccinations." The line for vaccinations is as long as the line for receiving rice...

### Summer Night

— Lao Cen

Cool drinks are unaffordable, but the climate is heating up to nearly 100 degrees every day. In this not-so-long alley, eight or nine out of ten families are struggling, so naturally no one can afford a fan or watermelon. However, poverty seems to have a special connection with heat. Even on a cold day, excessive work can cause sweat pores to become damp. In the north-facing attic, summer has become an unwelcome guest, like a steamer. Adding the unrelenting work, how can one catch their breath!

However, there is still a liberating evening every day. Lane-style factories may not operate night shifts due to power restrictions. Some have a "open-air" space that requires no money to acquire first: mats and low stools, placed densely and occupying the sidewalk. This maritime city always has a bit of southeast wind at night that is no less than a electric fan, blowing on tired bodies, which is quite comfortable. They are always so straightforward and earn money, without studying any complicated etiquette. In this space, instead of hearing "Good night and goodbye", the conversation starts with abrupt conversations:

"Gouzi's dad, the soap is a bit cheaper."

"Still can't afford it. Are you still using it to wash things in the summer?"

"That's right! In these years, being casual is enough... Will next month be better?"

"How can it be? Altogether two hundred is not enough, the rent is thirty, the household registration is more than twenty... one week, what is left to buy?"

Another "human stall" also issues murmuring whispers, and the children are louder than the women, and the noise almost drowns out the car noise on the road.

"...It's really great to have great difficulties, and small to have small difficulties. Although Nesi Xien wears a long shirt, don't listen to him talking beautifully. In fact, he can't even take care of himself. It's really not human to be an accountant. The clerk wants to borrow money, and the old man says he can't, which makes him resentful and difficult to deal with. A few days ago, the boss closed the door for three days because he didn't follow the market price. He was so unhappy that he took it out on his colleagues," "Just according to the current normal profits, I am unwilling no matter what. You are still clamoring for a full conversion to the new currency. I think you all should be careful during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Don't end up getting killed temporarily!" You hear, does that sound like human speech? The clerk ran hundreds of thousands of dollars for him, but he doesn't care about your life or death!"

"Your husband is not bad. You don't see Mr. Fang in No. 16. Others made a fortune by hoarding goods, but he lost everything. It's really rare. In May, he tried his best to resist everything. He refused to make deposit bills. He bought in at two yuan and two jiao. As a result, he lost everything. His wife ran away in anger, and his children were given away. He himself is skinny and doesn't know whether he is crazy or not. The landlord wants him back, but he refuses to move even if he dies, but he can't pay the rent? What a disaster."

At this time, a watermelon stall is launching a night market, and a group of children are drooling as they watch.

"Pinghu watermelon is sweeter, Golden melon is stronger!" One A Er shouts with a hoarse throat. But soon the children are chasing their mothers to buy, and the sounds of mothers scolding and crying drown out the A Er's voice.

"The watermelon seller A Er is really interesting. Sometimes he acts like a beggar, and sometimes he lives a prosperous life. This person has climbed up and down I don't know how many times, really enough for him."

"These kinds of people on the Bund will not starve to death. If he had smoked black and white opium, he would not have lived to this day. He is thrifty, willing to endure hardship, and willing to work. I think if things come down to an affordable price this time, maybe this time he can get on his feet."

"Look?" This is the sound of four or five people.

The stars are as bright as if they have fallen down, and the Silver River has already tilted. Dare to guess that tomorrow will be hot enough again!

### Riding in the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Thunder

Wei Cheng Wan Cui Zhen cupped his hands and said, "Sister Cui Zhen, I dare not disturb you, because this is not your business, it is my business." Cui Zhen said, "Your business is not my business? Think of me as having no parents above, no younger siblings below. If someone is to do it, it is better for me to do it than for Brother Cheng to do it, because I have fewer worries." "Alas! Why am I a woman? It would be so much better if I were like Huang Long." Because Cui Zhen, while picking up the matter of revenge, mentioned Huang Long unintentionally, Wei Cheng was stunned when he heard it, and followed her and said, "Huang Long, that's right, I have such a good assistant." He patted the table and quickly called Huang Long twice.

Mrs. Ye Er said, "Huang Long, didn't he commit a crime in Shanghai?... It's cold, go to sleep quickly. This is not just a matter of one or two days, it's almost a matter of one or two years. What did your mother say in her will? You can only look for the enemy after you have offspring." Mrs. Ye Er's sentence was equal to an order to stop talking. Wei Cheng shook his head, rubbed his chest, stood up, and spat out an endless breath of injustice, and walked out of the room. Mrs. Ye Er followed closely behind him, held Wei Cheng's hand, and tried it out, saying, "Your hand is still warm, is there a hot water bottle in the quilt?" Qun Zhen also walked up and said, "The hot water bottle, I asked Xique to send it to Brother Cheng's room. Second Aunt, don't come out, I'll send Brother Cheng back there." Cui Zhen rushed forward to open the door, and said in surprise, "So bright, is it dawn? Ah, no, it's snowing." A gust of cold wind followed and rolled in, slamming into Wei Cheng's face. Wei Cheng didn't feel cold, and followed behind Cui Zhen, walking east along the stone steps outside Shide Hall. The stone steps were also full of snow. Cui Zhen's footprints gradually became Wei Cheng's only path. Snowflakes fluttered on Wei Cheng's face and neck. When they reached the east wing, Cui Zhen opened the door and let Wei Cheng in. Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cui Zhen, sit in my room for a while?" Cui Zhen said, "I won't sit. You have snowflakes on your body, you should pat them off, otherwise it's like being in the rain." Wei Cheng said, "I know." Cui Zhen closed the door for Wei Cheng, and went back to Mrs. Ye Er's room and asked, "Second Aunt, is it okay to say these words to Brother Cheng?" Mrs. Ye Er had already burrowed the lower half of her body into the quilt, and said, "You should tell him. If you don't tell him, it will only make him feel uneasy." (148)

### Ink Stain

— Xinghua

One afternoon, with time to spare before class, the classroom was quiet, with only Xu Jun and Wu Jun present. Because the first class after the break was composition, they had both prepared their ink and were casually writing on blank paper with their brushes. Xu Jun scrutinized Wu Jun's face for a moment, then suddenly burst out laughing.

—Ha! Ha! Ha!

—What are you laughing at?

—Ha! Ha! Ha! Look at you!

—What? What? Wu Jun, bewildered, touched his face, trying to find something to laugh about.

—Ha! Ha! Ha!

—What do you mean? Wu Jun stared at Xu Jun in surprise, then suddenly froze, but immediately burst out laughing.

—Ha! Ha! Ha!

—What are you laughing at?

—I'm laughing at you. Haha!

—Haha! You're laughing at me? I'm laughing at you! Hahaha!

—Hahahaha!

—Hahahaha!

I was the third person to enter the classroom.

—What's going on? What's so funny? Tell us so we can all laugh!

—Hahaha! Look at him. Xu Jun said to me.

—Look at him! Hahaha.

I looked at both of their faces and couldn't help but laugh.

—Hahahaha!

—Isn't he ridiculous? Xu Jun laughed.

—Isn't he ridiculous? Wu Jun laughed.

Hahaha! You're both ridiculous.

The two of them were stunned by my laughter, and I took out a mirror.

—Look!

They looked at themselves in the mirror and froze. One discovered a blot of ink on his nose, and the other saw a smudge of black under the corner of his eye.

The three of us burst into mixed laughter.

—Hahaha!

How ridiculous it is to laugh at other people's flaws while carrying flaws of your own that you can't see and assume don't exist!

### The Xu Family Couple

— Wenchao

It was another sweltering 102 degrees, and even in the late afternoon, it still felt like being in a furnace, without a hint of coolness.

In the side room, the Xu family couple seemed particularly energetic, yelling at each other at the top of their lungs.

Mr. Xu was very angry. He took out a set of silk trousers from the closet, threw them on the bed, and said to Mrs. Xu:

"I told you several times to iron these for me, but they're still in the closet. I have friends inviting me to dinner tonight, what am I supposed to wear?"

Mrs. Xu was busy measuring rice from the rice bucket, preparing dinner, and didn't pay much attention to what he said.

"I wanted to iron them yesterday, but I was busy shaking out the mattress, catching bedbugs, and making the beds all afternoon, I couldn't find the time."

"Couldn't find the time? You never have time!" Mr. Xu said impatiently.

"That's ridiculous!" Mrs. Xu said, "The bedbugs were terrible last night, you kept saying you couldn't sleep and told me to clean them up every week..."

"You need to prioritize the important things. Everyone knows you're busy."

"Important? Everything is important! Buying groceries, cooking, if I'm late the children will be hungry; if I don't wash the clothes one day, there won't be any replacements the next day; these things keep me busy enough, and then I have to do laundry in the afternoon... everything requires me to use both hands."

Once Mrs. Xu started, Mr. Xu couldn't get a word in. She always had a long list of reasons, nagging on and on until Mr. Xu was speechless.

She pointed to the rice bucket and said:

"Look, we have two loads of rice at home, and with the heat, rice weevils are breeding. Then you say it's unsanitary and want me to take it out to dry and pick them out... It's killing me!"

"I said it's unsanitary, but you can't very well eat rice with weevils with your eyes open, can you?" Mr. Xu's attitude softened a little.

In contrast, Mrs. Xu's arrogance increased.

"This spring, I told you not to fire Wang Ma, but you wouldn't listen. You wanted to save money, but it's made my life miserable. Everything for the whole family is on my shoulders, washing clothes, cooking... When the weather is cooler, it's still manageable, but in this heat, who can stand it? I get up at six every morning and don't go to bed until midnight. I only have two hands, and I'm not made of iron..."

Mr. Xu was a "fool" and couldn't say anything after hearing his wife's rant.

"If I keep working like this, my health will give out. Tomorrow I'm going to the employment agency to hire a maid." Mrs. Xu was threatening to go on strike.

Mr. Xu was shocked. Hiring a maid would cost ten dollars a month, which was a small matter, but the two or three hundred dollars for food wouldn't be spared. And there were rumors of a tax on employing servants, how could he afford that?

"Hiring a maid is out of the question!" Mr. Xu said, "I'll help you with some things after I get home from work every day."

Mrs. Xu was very pleased to hear him say that. She felt that Mr. Xu had been too comfortable, going home from the office every day, taking a bath, and then sitting in the courtyard enjoying the cool air, without caring about anything at home. What made her especially angry was that he invited Old Pi from the attic to play chess, and she had to serve them tea and water. Now, taking advantage of Mr. Xu being cornered, she intended to make demands, but he had already offered on his own.

"Okay, when you get home every day, you can iron a few pieces of clothing; pick out rice weevils; and bathe A Mao and A Gou when you have time... On Sunday mornings, you can take apart the beds, shake out the mattresses, and catch bedbugs."

Mr. Xu silently put on his un-ironed clothes and went out.

### A Visit to a Friend in Short Sleeves

— Hurong

Going out on a hot day is the most annoying thing. At home, you can wear a tank top and shorts with slippers, but you can't do that outside. To show that you are an intellectual, you must wear a long gown, socks, and leather shoes. Running under the sun makes you sweat profusely, which is really uncomfortable.

Old Huang, who lives in the Cishu Building, called me and said he had something important to discuss and wanted me to come over right away. I thought I was going to suffer again, so I said to my wife, "Please get out my linen gown, I have to go out."

"Unfortunately, the children got it dirty, and it's soaking in the washbasin and hasn't been washed yet."

"What am I supposed to do then? That's the only long gown I have for summer."

"Why don't you just go out in short sleeves," my wife said jokingly.

Go out in short sleeves? My wife reminded me. I hesitated for a while, then resolutely put on shorts and a short-sleeved shirt and ran out.

I walked confidently on the street. Wearing short sleeves was cool and comfortable. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw others taking off their straw hats and using them as fans because they were so hot.

Who told you to wear long gowns? Dying for face and suffering the consequences! I became arrogant, treating everyone else as a fool. Carelessly, I stepped on the foot of a gentleman.

This caused trouble! I thought to myself—really, the gentleman's snow-white leather shoes were stained with a black mark. Before I could apologize, the gentleman brushed his hand a few times, glanced at me, and walked away. This was an unexpected result.

After walking a little further, I realized: The gentleman saw my outfit, and my tall stature, and thought I was one of the "loafers."

When I arrived at Cishu Building, I didn't take the elevator. (I remembered that Mr. Lu Xun once wore short sleeves to take the elevator and was kicked out by the elevator operator.) Although I climbed four floors, I didn't feel tired at all.

Old Huang seemed very surprised when he saw me. He said, "You came like this?"

"Isn't it convenient?" I said as I sat down.

We laughed happily.
