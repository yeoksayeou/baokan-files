### Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

It has been a full year since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. In this year, the overall situation in East Asia has undergone unprecedented changes, and the world situation has also been greatly affected. For more than a century, the power of Britain and the United States in East Asia has begun to collapse completely; the days of the Asian nations rising to self-determination have arrived!

Our Chinese nation, established in Asia, with cultural evolution spanning more than five thousand years, has a history that has shaken both China and foreign countries, with records continuously written. At present, we are standing in an unprecedented era. How can we shoulder the mission of one part of our Chinese nation? This is what we must constantly reflect upon and encourage ourselves to do.

The Greater East Asia War is not just a war of Japan alone, and the impact of the war is not limited to Japan alone. This is very clear, so the people of all East Asian countries cannot stay outside the war, which is especially obvious. Then, in this time of war, how can we not have a correct understanding of the relationship between China and Japan and their future, and of the development prospects of this war? And how can we abandon our own responsibilities?

The above is what we dare to encourage our compatriots on this anniversary of the Greater East Asia War!

However, we must further look at the rapid progress and expanded results of the Greater East Asia War in the past year, which are rare in world history! However, in order to thoroughly complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War and establish a new order in East Asia and the world, the efforts and struggles of China, Japan, and other nations are still needed. This is truly an undeniable truth today, and it is something we should always be vigilant about.

Looking back to before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan were both fighting for their respective national policies. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan had to undergo fundamental changes. The necessity for mutual dependence and shared joys and sorrows between the two countries has reached a point where there is no room for hesitation or consideration! There is no doubt that Japan's need for Chinese cooperation has increased sharply. Conversely, considering China's current situation, the severity of its war tribulations and the suffering of its people are rare in our country's history and are well known to both the Japanese government and public. Therefore, China's need for Japanese cooperation is no less than Japan's need for our country.

However, looking back at the facts of the past year, the degree of mutual cooperation has not yet reached the ideal state, which is something that the authorities and people of both China and Japan should deeply reflect upon today. Looking at our country's side, the degree of cooperation is naturally not satisfactory, and the lack of self-motivated cooperation is particularly regrettable. As a result of our review, we feel that it is necessary to offer advice to the friendly nation's government and public on this great anniversary. That is, why is there a lack of voluntary cooperation among the Chinese people? It seems that in the past the Japanese government and public have not fully valued the power of our people. As the saying goes, "The people are the foundation of the nation," and "Government lies in winning the people." Only with the full support of the people's power can all policies be smoothly implemented, and cooperation with Japan can achieve ideal results. The so-called valuing of the people's power begins with cultivating the power of the masses, ensuring the minimum living standards of the people as the first step. Only when the people's lives are guaranteed and the people's power is cultivated can we automatically and actively strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation and complete the great mission of the Greater East Asia War.

At the same time, we are even more willing to offer advice to our country's government and public that we should not belittle ourselves and abandon our own strength. We must recognize that we have a decisive power in the Greater East Asia War! If our cooperation with Japan reaches a suitable level, we can complete the mission of the war ahead of schedule. Conversely, not only China and Japan, but all of East Asia will suffer unimaginable consequences. So, how should we actively unleash the power of the entire nation to cooperate with Japan? The first is to improve national politics and concentrate the power of the people, and the second is to awaken Chongqing from its dream of relying on Britain and the United States, and jointly cooperate with friendly nations for the total liberation of the East Asian nations and thoroughly eliminate the power of Britain and the United States.

"He who wins the people prospers" is the guiding principle for great politicians in our country's history. "Ten thousand people support as one" is the political program implemented in Japan during this Greater East Asia War. China and Japan, both past and present, attach great importance to the power of the people, which has a decisive effect. Therefore, on this anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we solemnly put forward the above points.

Finally, we also take this opportunity to express our sincere condolences to the brave soldiers who sacrificed in the Greater East Asia War, and to wish China and Japan and all ethnic groups joint efforts to win the final victory—the liberation of East Asian nations!

### First Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War; Chairman Wang Elaborates on His Beliefs: China Must Cooperate with Japan to Advance Towards Coexistence and Co-prosperity

Central News Agency, Nanjing – On the eve of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang received Chinese and Japanese journalists at his official residence this afternoon. The journalists jointly raised three questions: (1) What about the long-term war system of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing? (2) What are your thoughts on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War? (3) What are your expectations for the Japanese people? The Chairman answered as follows: "At dawn on December 8th of last year, Commander-in-Chief Hata and Temporary Ambassador to China Hidaka explained that Japan had begun the Greater East Asia War. Subsequently, successive reports of Japanese military victories in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the naval battle off the coast of Malaya proved that the Central American navy in the Pacific could not resist the Japanese army. Subsequently, British and American strongholds in the Pacific and elsewhere were successively captured by the Japanese army. The Philippines, Burma, and various British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia were also occupied by the Japanese army. This can be said to be the beginning of the decline of Anglo-American aggression in China and the construction of a true New Order for Greater East Asia. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I express my heartfelt admiration for the spirit, determination, and struggle of the officers and soldiers of the friendly nation's army and navy, as well as the people. The Japanese people may be concerned about (1) why China is not participating in the war with all its strength during the Greater East Asia War, and (2) why full peace has not yet been realized more than two years after the National Government returned to its capital. These two points are indeed regrettable for China itself. We, the comrades engaged in the peace movement, feel particularly guilty. When I started the peace movement, I strongly stated that China and Japan must cooperate. This kind of cooperation is active, not passive. Those who do not understand the true meaning of peace may think that peace is only to stop the war with Japan and for China to get rest after the war. This kind of explanation violates the true meaning of Pan-Asianism and, in particular, does not understand China's challenges and the mission of the times. The so-called mission of the times, in terms of the environment in which China and Japan are located (then the current war is) a total war, brooking no retreat. In terms of China's environment, it has reached the stage where it must participate in a national group. From this, it can be seen that peace is by no means passive, but must be active. In other words, it is not for passively seeking to recover from the exhaustion after the war, but for actively cooperating with Japan in accordance with Pan-Asianism and advancing towards coexistence and co-prosperity. What is most hateful is that the Chongqing side is still obstructing the peace movement. Its stubborn belief in relying on the United States and Britain has not awakened even after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. We have absolutely nothing to expect from Chiang Kai-shek today. What we expect is only the people of Chongqing. Therefore, it is our major responsibility at present to promote the awakening of the people under the rule of Chongqing and participate in the peace movement. Some people believe that Japan's victory should promote Chongqing's belief in Japan. This view has its reasons, but what is more important is to make the general public have the belief that China and Japan can only coexist and co-prosper through cooperation, and that they will certainly be able to coexist and co-prosper. It is more important to enable the people of Chongqing to have such a view than anything else. Based on this, practical cooperation in the Greater East Asia War is important, but on the other hand, it is important to promote understanding among the general public in Chongqing of the true meaning of coexistence and co-prosperity and its possibility. We deeply feel the importance of our responsibility, that is, to further cooperate with Japan wholeheartedly in the future to establish a model of peace. If this point can be thoroughly achieved, it will surely enable Chongqing to suddenly awaken and throw itself into the embrace of the peace movement. China is a part of East Asia, and China must become a strong wing of East Asia. This is our argument. In terms of the war situation, Japan is in charge of the front-line work, while China is in charge of the rear-area work. However, if the Chinese people know that cooperation in the war will lead to the realization of peace, they will be able to coexist and co-prosper. Then, they will be able to do their best in any cooperation and any sacrifice. When the war broke out last year, the National Government issued a statement of sharing joys and sorrows. The so-called sharing joys means coexistence and co-prosperity, and the so-called sharing sorrows means cooperation with one heart. In the future, the National Government and the Chinese people will certainly follow this purpose and advance together with Japan. I deeply trust that the friendly nation's people will share this purpose, constantly encourage and clearly point out a great road of coexistence and co-prosperity. This is also what I, on the eve of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, wish to express sincerely to the Japanese people."

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Today (8th) is the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. In order to express the capital's people's celebration of the friendly forces' successive victories and their enthusiastic cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, the Capital People's Promoting Asia Congress for the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War will be held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:30 am.

### Talk by Commander-in-Chief Hata: Determined to Carry Out the Destruction of Chongqing; Do Our Best to Assist the Development of Allied Nations

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the eve of the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, General Hata Shunroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China, delivered a special talk, clarifying the determination of the Army in China to do its utmost to carry out operations against Chongqing. The general idea is that the Army in China has echoed the Southern Operations in the past year, suppressing the Chongqing army and the US Air Force in Chongqing, and destroying them at any time, suppressing Chongqing's resistance. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although Chongqing's aspirations have been contrary to its wishes, its combat power has been greatly depleted, its economy has been increasingly difficult, and there is no hope for the future of the war of resistance, it still entrusts its fate to the world war and devotes all its efforts to trying to make a long-term protracted war. In the future, due to the advancement of the US Air Force's power in the Chinese mainland and the US attempt to counterattack, all this should not be underestimated. However, in this Greater East Asia War, the true intention of the Empire to save Asia has become clear. Chongqing's concept of resistance will eventually tend to collapse. Moreover, with the majesty of the Empire's army and navy on the Chinese front line, it is only natural that the US and the US cannot attempt to resist. It can also be said that the solution to the Chinese front is the main axis of the advancement of the Greater East Asia War. What we, the Army in China, want to express is that all the generals of the Army in China have a strong determination to overcome all difficulties and strive to destroy Chongqing. At the same time, the National Government and the Chinese people under its rule are also making every effort to cooperate closely with the Empire for the liberation of Asia and the independence of China, sharing hardships and striving to complete the Greater East Asia War. This is truly admirable. The authorities of the Army in China will also do their best to assist the development of allied nations in the future, in order to jointly complete the great task of revitalizing Asia. The officers and men of the Army in China respectfully follow the imperial edict and deeply engrave in their hearts the enthusiasm of the country. They will certainly uplift their morale, adhere to the current national policy, give full play to their strength, and strive to move forward in order to complete their mission as soon as possible.

### Commemorating the Greater East Asia War; Reflections of Colonel Kamata, Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China: Eliminating British and American Forces and Creating Magnificent War Results; Resolving the Construction of a Co-prosperity and Happy Land for East Asian Nations

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) – Today is the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Colonel Kamata, Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, recently issued his reflections. The main points are as follows:

"When the Greater East Asia War broke out on December 8th of last year, our gratitude was beyond description. Looking around, the nations of our Greater East Asia had been groaning under the shackles of Britain and the United States for a hundred years. They had been constantly monopolized in terms of politics, economics, ideology, and culture. The gentle spirit of Greater East Asia was almost being chased into the depths of obscurity. We have always endured this insatiable ambition of Britain and the United States until today. This is because Japan is a nation that infinitely loves peace. In the past, Emperor Meiji said that all people within the four seas are brothers, how can there be unrest in the world? Reading the declaration of war issued by the Emperor of Japan on this day last year, we can also clearly know that Japan does not want to fight with other countries. However, the United States stubbornly adheres to the self-righteous Monroe Doctrine, using the open door, equal opportunity, and preservation of territory as slogans. In fact, it supports the old and selfish Nine-Power Treaty and the Washington System, constantly hindering the construction of a new co-prosperity sphere and the completion of the ideal of Greater East Asia. The attitude of Britain is also often the same as that of the United States. It monopolizes world trade and uses all kinds of schemes to maintain its own power. It once arrogantly claimed that if the Anglo-Saxons were not destroyed, there would be no hope for the development of other people. In order to recover East Asia from the hands of these arrogant and insolent British and Americans and restore the original appearance of each country's motherland, how should we sacrifice ourselves and resolutely rise up to deal with it? This is actually a cry of grief and indignation that cannot be stopped. In order to achieve the goal of each East Asian nation getting what it deserves, it is absolutely necessary to win the final victory. This is the so-called life-and-death gamble. Therefore, the one-shot-must-hit bullet condensed with the Japanese spirit instantly knocked down the 'Berthelot' and 'Wake' on the Huangpu River. This is not just the meaning of sinking one gunboat, but a symbol of the defeat of Britain and the United States being driven out of Greater East Asia. Sure enough, according to the subsequent reports, on the sea thousands of miles away in the Far East, the elite of the Japanese Imperial Navy fiercely attacked Pearl Harbor, the Pacific base of the American fleet. On December 10th, the British unsinkable battleship Prince of Wales and Repulse, which had always been boasted to the world, were also sunk by the Japanese army in the naval battle off the coast of Malaya. During the year, after the Java Sea battle, the Bali Island battle, the Surabaya battle, and the Batavia battle, the enemy ships were continuously wiped out. Later, the Indian Ocean operation, the Coral Sea battle, and the Solomon Sea battle all destroyed the enemy fleet, harvesting war results unprecedented in world war history. At present, the British and American forces entrenched in Greater East Asia have been completely driven out and wiped clean. The sea and air control of Greater East Asia have been taken into the hands of Japan. From the west coast of the United States in the east, to the Aleutian Islands in the north, from Australia in the south, across Madagascar in the west to the Atlantic Ocean, the vastness of the earth and the scale of the unparalleled operation can be found anywhere in world war history? I am afraid that this is an unprecedented and the largest operation that human beings cannot imagine. What is regrettable is that the Chongqing side has not yet awakened from its dream of resistance and is still being driven by Britain and the United States. The nature of the Sino-Japanese Incident has changed due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The purpose and reason for Japan's launching of the holy war is to defeat the British and Americans entrenched in East Asia and their followers who challenge Japan inseparably. Today, when the purpose and reason have been clarified, the Chongqing side still relies on Britain and the United States and makes futile resistance, which is truly sad. However, due to the impact of Japan's amazing war results and the retreat of Britain and the United States from Asia, it has already fallen into the abyss of decline and is now just lingering on its last breath. We will never relax our punishment for this last-ditch stupid action of Chongqing, and we will definitely move forward to complete the holy war purpose of our side at the beginning of the incident. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy units stationed in China have fought extremely bravely. Not to mention the scale is too large. The 3,000 nautical miles of the Chinese coast have been effectively blockaded. In order to suppress the defeated enemies who attempt to sabotage the rear, we have further exerted the power of the naval aviation, fiercely bombing the strongholds of Chongqing. We have also used unparalleled elite troops to ensure long-distance inland river transportation and gradually control the important areas of Chongqing. Due to the control of the sea and air control along the Chinese coast, we have established a system to destroy any foreign enemy from the West Pacific. We are convinced that the Greater East Asia War has established an absolutely invincible system. We must not show any leniency to the enemy forces that attempt to act recklessly in the vast ocean and must completely destroy them. At the same time, we must not forget the strong self-reflection of winning without arrogance. This is to appease the emperor above and comfort the heroic spirits of the comrades who sacrificed their lives for the country below. According to Washington news, the United States is observing a day of silence today, and Roosevelt has suspended all speeches and talks. The reason is that the American fleet suffered a disastrous defeat in the Pearl Harbor battle, which is a shameful day for the United States. From this, we can see how strong Japan's strength is. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, thinking that the purpose of the war is to liberate the nations of Greater East Asia and build a truly co-prosperous and happy land, the future is bright and limitless, and how can we not be happy? We also hope that we will not be satisfied with today's victory and that it is necessary to make a decision to respond to the new stage of the war."

### Ambassador Shigemitsu's Statement: Japan Has Unwavering Determination; Hopes Allied Nations Will Cooperatively Advance the War

Nanjing, 7th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - On the eve of the first anniversary of the war, Ambassador Shigemitsu issued a statement tonight, saying that the development of the Greater East Asia War over the past year shows that the Japanese people have an unwavering determination and will cooperate with the people of Japan's allied nations to advance the war until Japan and East Asia achieve final victory. The peoples of East Asia should know that it is time for Asia to rise. The people of all East Asian countries must cooperate with each other, overcome difficulties, and work together to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War connected the China Incident with the world war that influenced the world. However, before the outbreak of this war, the United States and Britain had already used the China Incident to implement their aggressive policies in East Asia. Chongqing, like a puppet, danced to the tune of the United States and Britain. Now that the new war has broken out, Britain and the United States have torn off their masks and provoked us. The war against the century-old power of Britain and the United States in East Asia has thus broken out. We are now cooperating with our friendly nations of Germany and Italy to build a new world order and are writing a new transformation in world history. The Japanese ambassador also relayed the National Government's statement that since the National Government returned to Nanjing, it has been rapidly advancing in politics, economy, culture, and society. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China and the Japanese Empire have shared weal and woe, working to revive China and defend East Asia. No matter how long the war lasts and how difficult daily life is, we will never lose our confidence in cooperating with our allied nations and will surely win.

### Minister Tajiri Issues a Statement

(Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch) - Today is the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Japanese Minister Tajiri specially issued a statement entitled "Confidence and Determination in the Second Year of the Greater East Asia War." The main points are recorded as follows: The Greater East Asia War has entered its second year starting today. Looking back to this day last year, we respectfully read the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States, vowing with the belief of certain victory and an unwavering determination. For a year, under the Emperor's authority, the army and navy soldiers have carried out fierce battles in all aspects, whether on land, sea, or air, establishing unprecedentedly glorious achievements in world war history. The power of Britain and the United States has been completely driven out of Greater East Asia. We must win without arrogance, further consolidate our certain victory posture, strengthen cooperation with allied nations, and devote all our efforts to overthrow the enemy's plans. Under these circumstances, entering the second year of the war, there are two issues that we should re-recognize. First, today's Japan is no longer the island nation of Japan, but the Japan of Greater East Asia, the Japan of the world, that is, the Japan that combines the morally righteous vitality to transform world history with the power to destroy evil and reveal righteousness. Second, there are still remnants of the evil roots of Anglo-American materialistic civilization, egoism, and liberalism in our minds, which should be cleared away as soon as possible. Currently, on the thousands of miles of front lines, the Imperial Army soldiers, whether affected by the cold or hit by the heat waves, are working hard day and night, bravely advancing to defend Greater East Asia and build a new Japan. We are sincerely grateful and cannot express it in words. At the same time, whether in the economic war or in the ideological war, we will advance with the same will as the soldiers on the front lines, further consolidate, and acquire the determination to win the post-war victory.

### Consul General Yano Encourages East Asians

(Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch) - Mr. Yano, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, recently issued a statement to commemorate the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, as follows: Today, as we joyfully celebrate the first anniversary of the war, with the promulgation of the Imperial Rescript and the repeated victories of the Japanese army, creating unprecedented achievements in war history, we are extremely fortunate. At the same time, we increasingly hope for the continued military success of the soldiers fighting on the front lines, and we can only bow our heads in silent prayer for the heroic spirits who died for the holy war, expressing our heartfelt gratitude. The reason why we call the Greater East Asia War a holy war is that the purpose of the war is to extend morality and justice to East Asia, and then spread it to the world, that is, to hope that justice and humanity can be realized among human beings. The great victories of the Japanese army are due to the superiority of weapons, but in fact, they are due to the will of the soldiers, that is, the belief in certain victory. Extending this example, the foundation for cultivating combat power lies in the will of the people. The people must truly unite, with one heart and one mind. If everyone realizes that this holy war is a holy war for every citizen, then the situation of certain victory and invincibility can be established. The so-called war of every citizen means that, regardless of one's profession, one should fight against people of the enemy country in the same professional field. Our soldiers should be better than the soldiers of the enemy country, officials should be better than the officials of the enemy country, businessmen should be better than the businessmen of the enemy country, and technicians should be better than the technicians of the enemy country. If we can consider this with such sincerity, then the situation of total war can be established immediately.

### The Glorious Page of War History of the Japanese Army in Various Parts of East Asia – Released by the Japanese Army Press Department –

Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch – It has been a year since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.

### Another Announcement to the National People

— Wang Zhaoming

—How to Share Weal and Woe—

Today last year, our friendly nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War. The National Government immediately issued a statement, resolving to share weal and woe with our friendly nation Japan. Since then, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have been victorious in every battle and have captured every place they attacked. For a century, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been swept away. There is no longer room for Britain and the United States to be rampant in the Eastern Pacific and the South Seas. Their colonies, from the Philippines in the east to Burma in the west, and including the Malay Archipelago and the Dutch East Indies in the south, have been lost one after another. On the one hand, it is the decline of the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. On the other hand, it is the beginning of East Asian co-prosperity. In just one year, the achievements of our friendly nation Japan have been so great. This is deeply gratifying. While celebrating, we remember the officers and soldiers on the front lines of our friendly nation and the people at home who have been working tirelessly day and night, achieving this unprecedented great undertaking with a spirit of hardship and perseverance. We are truly filled with admiration. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I would first like to express my heartfelt wishes and respect to the government of our friendly nation, the officers and soldiers on the front lines, and all the people.

The victory of the Greater East Asia War is the foundation for the establishment of East Asian co-prosperity. If we want to fully realize East Asian co-prosperity, we must continue to strive for the completion of the Greater East Asia War. After paying tribute to our friendly nation, I must say something frankly to the Chinese people.

We are determined to share weal and woe with our friendly nation Japan, but how do we share weal and woe? Let me first explain the meaning of sharing weal and woe.

I have used farming to explain the meaning of sharing weal and woe. When cultivating, everyone sweats and toils in the fields, experiencing hardship. This is sharing woe. When harvesting, everyone gathers in the countryside, tasting the new grains and enjoying satiety. This is sharing weal. From this, we can know that we must first share woe and then share weal. Sharing woe is the present, faithful effort. Sharing weal is the certain hope for the future.

Barbarian peoples do not know how to share weal and woe. They only know how to take happiness for themselves and give suffering to others. From this, hatred, jealousy, and acts of killing arise. Civilized peoples are different. From a negative perspective, it is "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." From a positive perspective, it is "if you want to establish yourself, establish others; if you want to succeed, help others succeed." This is the sharing of weal and woe between people. From a moral perspective, it is "sharing good with others." From a lifestyle perspective, it is sharing joy with others. Confucius said it well, "People do not only love their own parents, nor only care for their own children." Mencius said it well, "Those who rejoice in the joy of others will also rejoice in their own joy; those who grieve in the sorrow of others will also grieve in their own sorrow." The essence of Eastern morality is none other than benevolence and forgiveness. This is the moral creed between people, and it is also the sharing of weal and woe between people.

Extending from the relationship between people to the relationship between countries, countries that follow utilitarianism, like barbarian peoples, do not know how to share weal and woe. For example, imperialism treats colonies as if they only know how to extract their labor and resources to provide for their own enjoyment. In peacetime, they place themselves in the utmost happiness and put others in the utmost suffering. In wartime, they force people to endure suffering and never allow them to share weal. Even if they allow it, it is just empty words. The last world war, Britain's treatment of India, is the most obvious example. For this reason, the Indian people, even if they want to remain united, cannot do so.

The above is a reference to the example of only knowing how to share woe with others and not knowing how to share weal with others. But there are also some countries that only know how to share weal with others and do not share woe with others. For example, during the last world war, some countries did not try their best to assist in the war, but after the war, they took advantage of the opportunity to share the benefits. These benefits were not obtained through labor, or at least obtained significant benefits with minimal labor. Such benefits cannot be guaranteed forever, and may even lead to disaster. These examples are too numerous to mention. In short, only knowing how to share woe and not knowing how to share weal is selfish and cruel. Only knowing how to share weal and not knowing how to share woe is opportunistic and cunning. The former is a crime that powerful countries easily commit, and the latter is a crime that weak countries easily commit. Tracing their roots, they are all due to utilitarianism. We Eastern countries must replace Western utilitarianism with a spirit of morality.

The morality between people is benevolence and forgiveness, and the morality between countries is also benevolence and forgiveness. Based on benevolence and forgiveness, we practice the sharing of weal and woe between countries. The so-called sharing of woe is not just passively sharing suffering, but also actively struggling together in suffering. It is not just enduring suffering with the greatest courage, but also relieving suffering with the greatest effort. The so-called sharing of weal is not just aiming to share happiness, but also continuously creating happiness together with the greatest effort, in order to enjoy it together. This is the greatest significance of the National Government's declaration of sharing weal and woe.

Now, let us further explain how to share weal and woe. First, from a psychological perspective, the psychology of resistance in the past was "resistance is death, non-resistance is also death; rather than die without resisting, it is better to die resisting." This argument came from pessimism. In addition, it was mixed with the hope of British and American aid and cooperation with the Communist Party. This was a state of confusion. The peace movement first transformed this psychology, believing that peace could save the country and that there was no need to be pessimistic. As for relying on British and American aid and cooperation with the Communist bandits, it was like drinking poison to quench thirst. This was a head-on psychological transformation. By the time the Greater East Asia War broke out, the psychology of the peace movement had gone even further. The entire East Asia was facing a critical juncture of life and death. Any country or nation located in East Asia was either an ally of East Asia or a traitor to East Asia. The Greater Asianism advocated by the Founding Father was no longer an ideal, but a current reality. Unless the Chinese people do not want to save the country, if they want to save the country, there is no other way than to defend East Asia. Defending East Asia is saving the country, and saving the country and defending East Asia are the same thing, not two different things. In the past, we only said that peace could save the country and that there was no need to continue resisting. Now, if we want to save the country, we can only cooperate with Japan to defend East Asia. The so-called continued resistance is only being used by Britain and the United States to help the Communist bandits shout. From the perspective of defending East Asia, it is an act of betrayal. From the perspective of saving the country, it is an act of vermin. This psychological transformation is indeed a further step than the initial peace movement, and it is indeed the original purpose of the National Revolution, the original face of the Chinese people.

The meaning of building a new order in East Asia lies on the one hand in eliminating British and American imperialism, and on the other hand in eliminating communism, and re-establishing a situation based on morality. The New Citizens Movement, based on this meaning, has more specifically defined the transition from narrow nationalism to national groupism, from individualism to collectivism, and from private capitalism to state capitalism. This is to thoroughly transform the spiritual outlook in politics, economy, and culture. To accomplish this great mission, we need the combined efforts of people in the country, and at the same time, we need the exchange of ideas between Chinese and Japanese people. From the exchange of ideas, we can gradually lead to consistency of action. To work together to overcome all difficulties is to share woe. To support each other and walk together on the road to light is to share weal. This is pointing out the meaning of sharing weal and woe from a psychological perspective. From an environmental perspective, in the Greater East Asia War, Japan stands on the front line, and China is located in the rear. After years of exhaustion in China, we are truly apprehensive about cooperation. However, the responsibilities of the rear cannot be ignored. Establishing security and improving people's livelihoods are the greatest guidelines of the National Government since its return to the capital, and they are also the greatest tasks of China, located in the rear, in the Greater East Asia War. In terms of establishing security, on the negative side, it is to eliminate the Communist bandits so that they can no longer harass the localities. On the positive side, it is still based on psychological transformation, so that the general public understands the great cause, each works hard in their own position. All current anti-bandit work, as well as all security work, the friendly nation's officers and soldiers, in the midst of their busy work, give us all kinds of assistance, and we also actively move forward, not avoiding any difficulties and dangers. These are all constantly demonstrating the meaning of seeking shared weal through shared woe. In terms of improving people's livelihoods, the greatest current suffering is the lack of materials and soaring prices. We must analyze in these sufferings which are unavoidable sufferings and which are avoidable sufferings. For example, the decline in production due to the lack of full peace and the disruption of transportation due to the incomplete Greater East Asia War. These sufferings are unavoidable, we can only bear them with great courage based on the meaning of sharing woe, and do our best to increase production, restore transportation, and save on consumption. We recognize that these sufferings are not only unavoidable phenomena, but also the heavy responsibilities that we should bear, overcoming the bad environment with a tense mood. As for the imperfections in economic institutions, the unsoundness of social organizations, and the various shortcomings in personnel and technology, which have not been improved, these are avoidable sufferings. We can only base on the meaning of sharing woe, without selfish or self-interested intentions, without following old ways and being content with the present, without favoritism, and without avoiding obstacles, and strive to correct the shortcomings. In this way, we will be able to gradually reduce and eliminate all kinds of sufferings. In short, if these complex problems do not have a consistent spirit, they will only become more complex on top of complexity, hitting walls everywhere, and being constrained everywhere. If we are based on the psychology of sharing weal and woe, we will be able to take care of each other and help each other without hesitation, and we will be able to make complexity simple. This is pointing out the meaning of sharing weal and woe from an environmental perspective.

As mentioned above, the so-called sharing of weal refers to the future co-existence and co-prosperity of China and Japan, and the so-called sharing of woe refers to the current cooperation between China and Japan, working together to overcome all difficulties. The compatriots of the whole country must know that great light is in sight, with firm beliefs and unwavering aspirations. At the same time, we must also know that only effort can approach the light and reach the light. Compatriots of the whole country, please come forward quickly, with a spirit of courage, diligence, perseverance, and hard work, to complete the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia.

### The Suffering of Chongqing's Industrial Sector

The issue of resources is the most pressing problem for the Chongqing government at present, especially as international connections are severed, further exacerbating the severity. Intensifying industrial production to increase resource wealth has become an urgent requirement within the mainland. However, the government's measures often miss the mark, nominally assisting but in reality undermining. The environment encountered by the industrial sector and the current reality directly contradict the goal of "increasing production." The ills can be summarized as follows:

General Ills of the Industrial Sector

(A) Lack of Security for Enterprises: Factories lack reliable protection. Generally, those who invest in industry view it as wartime speculation. Prudent individuals are unwilling to invest boldly, while those seeking shortcuts focus solely on pursuing exorbitant profits, not hesitating to raise prices. Those who operate with genuine integrity constantly feel the pain of an unstable environment.

(B) Imbalanced Price Control Policies: The imbalance of price control policies forces some industries to maintain their existence through idling. Price control organizations often focus solely on suppressing the prices of industrial finished products, but fail to simultaneously suppress the prices of raw materials. Consequently, industrialists buy raw materials at high prices and sell finished products at low prices, inevitably incurring losses. Under these circumstances, in order to reduce losses, industrialists can only prolong the production process or reduce output, waiting for an increase in the approved selling price of products. This phenomenon was first seen in the flour milling industry.

(C) Uneven Distribution of Power and Raw Materials: The allocation of power and raw materials has not been based sufficiently on the needs of the people, striving for rationality. Consequently, some industries not essential to people's livelihoods, possessing superior influence, can obtain a sufficient supply of power and raw materials, allowing them to manufacture as much as possible. Meanwhile, some industries directly related to people's livelihoods, lacking connections, suffer the regret of being left out. Furthermore, since all seaports have been blockaded, the lack of imported industrial raw materials is increasingly felt, posing a current industrial crisis. Since the Ministry of Military Administration began centralizing the purchase of metals and electrical materials, privately-run factories have suffered greatly. Although it is said that military affairs come first during wartime, efforts should still be made to adjust surpluses and deficits, allowing privately-run industries a chance to breathe.

(D) Exhaustion of Capital: Due to skyrocketing prices, there is a widespread exhaustion of industrial capital. The reason for losses in running industries currently lies in the fact that after each turnover of capital, the capital decreases. However, even those who make a profit often feel that their capital is insufficient after each turnover. This is because the profit that can be obtained is not enough to offset the high prices. The lack of capital prevents many industries from fully realizing their production capacity.

The difficulties of the industrial sector mentioned above cannot be corrected by the industrial sector itself without appropriate government measures. Therefore, industrial colleagues, united as the Relocated Factories Association of Sichuan, the Southwest Industrial Association, and the Chongqing National Products Manufacturers Association, have issued calls reflecting the difficulties and expectations of the industrial sector. These calls further reflect and prove the inadequacy of government measures.

Unreasonable Tax Burden

During wartime, the biggest premise of taxation is to shrink the currency and stabilize prices. Therefore, taxes must be levied where currency is located, and those that stimulate price increases must be avoided as much as possible. In the past two years, the prices of agricultural products have risen far more than domestically produced industrial goods and general commodities. Therefore, currency inflation is no longer in urban industry and commerce, but in rural land. However, taxes are still levied far more heavily on industry and commerce than on land. After the in-kind collection of land tax, the burden on landlords still averages only about 5% of land rent income, so this situation still exists. As for what the industrial sector particularly fears, it is that most of their assets are houses and machinery that depreciate daily and monthly. If depreciation reserves are set aside according to the statutory percentage, due to the disparity between the original price and the current price, it will be impossible to replace old with new. Furthermore, if this is used to calculate profits and pay taxes, the result of taxing illusory profits will be a daily depletion of working capital, causing production to gradually decline and eventually become unsustainable. To remedy this, it is necessary to continuously increase capital or merge with each other to increase strength. However, when it comes to increasing capital, it is first necessary to seek a balance between the rights and interests of old and new shareholders, which requires reassessing the value of assets. The result of asset reassessment is again illusory profits, and again real taxes are levied. The income from increasing capital may not be enough to offset the expenditure on taxes, so it is better not to increase capital. When it comes to mergers, both parties must also reassess the value of their assets and still pay statutory taxes. The situation of not being able to recoup the losses is even worse than increasing capital. This is the difficulty caused by direct taxes. Therefore, in today's environment of high prices, taxation is no longer the main means of shrinking the currency.

Income tax and excessive profit tax should originally target individual income and profits in order to achieve the goal of equalizing wealth. If they target industrial organizations, they will harm the development of organizations more and affect individual wealth less, inevitably causing everyone to dislike organizational structures and dismantle them into smaller units, which is not a good strategy. Indirect taxes are easily passed on by merchants, who always add profits, so those who levy them are few and those who pass them on are many, which has become common practice. It is no longer possible to allow indirect taxes to increase on necessities for people's livelihoods, stimulating market prices. The implementation of consumption taxes only involves setting up checkpoints everywhere in the mainland, increasing the burden of freight, which is certainly not in line with the price increase.

Crisis of Capital Flight

The rise in raw materials is faster than the rise in industrial finished products. After each round of reproduction, the lack of capital is felt. Coupled with the impact of taxing illusory profits, those who possess capital dismantle them into smaller units, engaging in hoarding in commerce or depositing fixed-term funds to seek greater profits and ensure the liquidity of capital. Who would then be willing to risk huge amounts for meager profits to invest in industry? On the one hand, the need for capital increases cumulatively with the degree of reproduction, while on the other hand, the source of capital becomes increasingly depleted. The industrial sector sincerely feels that it lacks the strength to maintain its production volume.

The expedient way to solve the problem of industrial capital is to expand industrial loans. However, the total annual amount of government loans is only tens of millions of yuan, while the production value of privately-run industrial and mining enterprises is no less than one million yuan per year. The loan amount accounts for only 2%, which fully demonstrates the smallness of government loans.

Transportation Obstacles and Multi-Headed Control

Convenient transportation ensures smooth sources of goods, and the problem of resources can naturally be reduced in severity. If merchants are free from unexpected disturbances, they will not only be happy to operate, but also reduce costs. Prices can also be slightly stabilized. The industrial sector's acquisition of raw materials and the sale of finished products both rely on convenient transportation. Unfortunately, there is a lack of transportation vehicles, and checkpoints are everywhere, arbitrarily detaining merchants' goods, even arbitrarily confiscating them as fines, without legal protection for human rights or property rights. They merely increase tax revenue in name, disregarding the impact on the flow of goods and the trend of rising prices. Moreover, a city is an economic unit, and industry and commerce within the city area have interdependent relationships. Checkpoints cannot be set up in between, forcibly dividing them, causing the citizens to bear burdens and losing their balance. The inspection agencies established by military organizations and local governments have no clearly defined inspection standards, often interfering with legitimate freight.

Now, organizations overlap, government orders are inconsistent, and shirking responsibility and creating difficulties are unavoidable. Limited manpower is thus wasted on circuitous routes, and valuable materials are consumed by corrosion or damaged by artillery fire. The losses to the people are great, and there are many obstacles. Few can view this as anything but a daunting path.

Recalling the inland industrial sector, many have traveled tens of thousands of miles, experienced countless dangers, and overcome countless difficulties to relocate here, originally hoping to maintain and develop their productivity and realize national industrialization under the protection of the government. Now, to encounter such a difficult environment was certainly not anticipated.

### First Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Citywide Commemoration, Municipal Government Holds Commemorative Meeting and Broadcasts Speeches

Today is the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War.

Tomorrow (9th), from 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM, the Director of the Education Bureau will give a broadcast to students throughout the city, entitled "The Greater East Asia War and Chinese Education." In addition, the twelve district associations affiliated with the municipal government will also hold commemorative ceremonies separately.

Silent Commemoration

The authorities of the French Concession in this city have determined that at 11:59 AM on Tuesday, December 8th today, a whistle will be blown to notify the entire city of Shanghai to observe one minute of silence to commemorate those who died in the war.

### Changes in Procedures for Renewing House Sublease Licenses

The deadline for the second half of this year (July to December) for the Municipal Council's house sublease licenses is the end of this month. The licensing office has notified all landlords to collect them as soon as possible, and lawsuits will be filed separately if the deadline is exceeded. The sublease licenses for the period from January to the end of June next year have been scheduled to begin issuing applications from the 14th of this month. To facilitate the collection of licenses in various districts, the following locations have been designated where they can be collected nearby: (1) 788 Seymour Road, (2) 1 Jessfield Road, (3) 160 Macdonnell Road, (4) 11 Singapore Road, (5) 1461 Sinza Road, (6) 130 Haining Road, (7) 270 North Fujian Road, (8) 558 Qiwupu Road, (9) 153 Zhoushan Road. The deadline for issuing these application forms is the 23rd of this month. After collecting them, they must be filled out item by item, and the license fee (48 yuan for houses with more than six rooms, 18 yuan for houses with six or fewer rooms) must be attached to the application form and paid at the licensing office on the designated date to exchange for a new license. If the deadline is exceeded, a late fee will be added according to the number of days exceeded as a penalty. This method is being implemented for the first time and will inevitably be strictly enforced. Therefore, sub-landlords should understand the advantages and disadvantages and not hesitate.

### Japanese Military Authorities to Return Factories for the Tenth Time: Total of Eleven Factories

According to the Allied News Agency, in order to promote economic cooperation between China and Japan, the Japanese military authorities have previously implemented the return of factories managed by the Japanese military due to the Sino-Japanese War nine times. It has now been heard that the military authorities have also determined that on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on the 8th of this month, they will hold the tenth ceremony for returning military-managed factories at the Dowa Foreign Firm Hotel in this city, starting at 2:00 PM. A total of eleven factories, including four textile factories, six match factories, and one dye factory in various parts of Central China, will be handed over to the Chinese side. The list of factory names to be returned this time is as follows: (1) Zhanghua Wool Textile Co., Ltd., (2) Liyong Textile Co., Ltd., (3) Yongan Textile Factory No. 1, (4) Dahua Printing and Dyeing Factory, (5) Da Zhonghua Match Company No. 6 Factory (total of six), (6) Da Zhong Dyeing Factory.

### Municipal Police Chief Lu Ying Inspects Clearing Villages

Municipal Police Chief Lu Ying, with the qualifications of Deputy Commander of Security, recently accompanied Lieutenant General Matsui, the Supreme Advisor to the National Government Military Commission, to inspect the situation of clearing villages in the suburbs of Shanghai. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties and issued a statement saying that this time, he accompanied Lieutenant General Matsui to inspect the actual progress of the work of clearing villages in the suburbs of Shanghai. In addition to visiting the Shanghai Branch of the Clearing Village Committee, he also went to Nanhui Zhoupu and other places to inspect and review the security forces and hold instruction ceremonies. He practically investigated the lives of the people in various clearing villages. The situation in each district was extremely peaceful. The district police bureau maintained local security, and police discipline and spirit were excellent, which was particularly gratifying. The general construction status is also being actively expanded. Harmony emphasizes construction first, and progress is steadily being made in the clearing villages. The future is extremely promising.

### Materials Control Department Handles Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth: Registration Date from the 10th to the 15th, Those Who Do Not Register Will Not Be Able to Move Them Later

After the Municipal Council established the Materials Control Department, the various offices for flour, food, and other items were merged under the department's jurisdiction. The office is located in Room 90 of the Municipal Council Building. Starting yesterday, the registration and movement of cotton cloth (including processed and white cloth) and cotton yarn were handled. From yesterday (7th) to the 9th, the three days are for issuing registration certificates. There are three types of certificates: (1) Cotton Yarn Registration Certificate, (2) White Cloth Registration Certificate, (3) Processed Cotton Cloth Registration Certificate.

Those Who Do Not Register Cannot Move Them

Each certificate is sold for two yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Each storage location is considered a unit, which requires filling out one certificate. After the certificate issuing date ends on the 9th, all owners of cotton yarn or cotton cloth must fill out the certificate from the 10th to the 15th and send it to the Control Department. Each item must be filled out accurately and truthfully. If the registration procedures are not completed by the deadline, they will be confiscated once discovered.

Three Types of Certificates, Categories

The Datong News Agency reporter inquired that after the registration procedures are completed, future movements must be applied for to the Control Department. As for the types of cotton cloth and cotton yarn registration, according to the registration form, cotton yarn includes fine and coarse counts. White cloth includes coarse cloth, linen cloth, powder bag cloth, crepe, coarse and fine twill, straight tribute, flannel, and other white cloth. Processed cloth includes colored cotton cloth, such as black, bleached, blue, various colors, and fine woven categories.

Yarn and Cloth Allocation Control Association

After the two concession authorities implemented the maximum price limit for cotton yarn and cotton cloth on the 1st of this month, in order to thoroughly control yarn and cloth prices, a rationing system will be adopted for yarn and cloth. Although the specific plan has not yet been decided, in general, major yarn and cloth merchants (including Chinese and Japanese merchants) will jointly invest in kind to form a Yarn and Cloth Allocation Control Association. All allocation matters will be handled by the association. For small-scale yarn and cloth businesses, all yarn and cloth will be purchased by the Yarn and Cloth Allocation Control Association.

### Traffic in the Lao Zha District Was Blocked Once Yesterday

All roads in the Lao Zha District were blocked once at around 2:15 PM yesterday due to a terror drill. Traffic was temporarily interrupted for about half an hour before returning to normal.

### The Silver and Money Industry Joint Conference Decided on the Method of Transferring the Dao Deed Deposit, Applying for the Lifting of Enemy Property Treatment

The Silver and Money Industry Joint Association recently issued a notice to its member banks and shops, stating that regarding the Japanese authorities' proclamation of October 10th, if the true owner of real estate is a non-enemy national, they may apply for the lifting of enemy property treatment and the transfer of the Japanese register Dao deed within three months, otherwise their rights will not be recognized. Most banks and money shops have

Dao Deed Deposits

relationships, which are very important. Therefore, a small group meeting of the Banking Association studied and discussed several items in detail, and proposed a method. This meeting decided to pass the proposed method. Now, the small group meeting's resolution is recorded for your reference. The method decided by the small group meeting is as follows: (1) For all customers of silver and money industry member banks and shops who hold deposit receipts or other documents from various banks and shops regarding Dao deeds, except for foreign firms from neutral countries registered with the consulates of neutral countries, Dao deeds registered with the consulates of other countries should be applied for by the relevant banks and shops to lift enemy property treatment and

Exchange for the Japanese Register

Dao deed, without the need to add additional endorsements on the original receipt or other documents. (2) For all customers notified by various banks and shops, if they fail to complete the power of attorney within the prescribed date, the application procedures may be handled directly by the various banks and shops without further notification to avoid delays. (3) For Dao deeds that have not been transferred and are used as deposits, if customers still do not come to the banks and shops to jointly apply for the lifting of treatment and exchange the Japanese register Dao deed, or do not come to the banks to exchange the deposit after being notified by the various banks and shops, the various banks and shops may limit the debtors to redeem the deed. It is heard that various banks and shops have already complied and have separately informed customers who have previously pledged Dao deeds (1) those who have not transferred to the accounts of the various banks and shops, and (2) those who have transferred to the accounts of the various banks and shops, to handle the application for transfer matters.

### The Municipal Council Solemnly Declares that it Will Continue to Supply Rice and Flour: The Rumor of Food Ration Disruption is Groundless, and the Supply of Oil, Salt, and Sugar Will Continue

Recently, various parties in Shanghai have attached great importance to the issue of people's food. The Municipal Council solemnly declares that in addition to continuing to supply food rations, major food items such as sugar, oil, and salt have also been adjusted by various control departments to the best of their ability. On the one hand, they are smoothing the source of goods, and on the other hand, they are distributing them fairly, hoping to match supply and demand and maintain the stability of people's food. As for minor food items such as meat, poultry, and vegetables, the source has not been lacking recently, and the price differences are also noteworthy.

Rice and Grain

The Municipal Council Information Office announced yesterday: "It has been found that unscrupulous people dare to spread rumors that the supply of rice and flour by this bureau will be stopped. This bureau solemnly declares that the above rumors are completely groundless. This bureau welcomes reports of the source of the rumors. The rumor of food ration disruption is completely a case of groundless worry, and its source may be the tricks of rice peddlers. The higher the price of national rice, the more prevalent the rumors, and the higher the profits for rice peddlers. Now that the Municipal Council has declared this, the rumors will be debunked."

Sugar

The allocation of sugar this month has been increased to 30,000 bags. Although there is still a phenomenon of queuing to buy, there is no difficulty in buying it for the time being. A few days ago, 60,000 bags of Taiwan sugar arrived in Shanghai, and Shanghai has now joined the Hong Kong-Philippines trade agreement. Therefore, it is hoped that sugar from the Philippines can be transported to Shanghai to maintain the supply. The current problem is how to obtain the understanding of the military distribution combination and increase the monthly allocation.

In order to avoid congestion, the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has increased the number of retail sugar merchants for door-to-door sales, strictly supervising sales to prevent malpractices. The December sugar allocation has been prepared, such as issuing sugar purchase certificates to various retailers. The improved method of selling sugar based on house donation tickets after December will be announced by the cooperative at that time to facilitate purchases by genuine food households. For those who need sugar due to business needs, the office adopts a permission system to grant special allocations. The allocation rate is determined according to the actual needs of each industry. It is stipulated that the sugar allocated under special circumstances is limited to the applicant's business needs and must not be sold privately. If it is discovered, it will be investigated and the allocation right will be permanently suspended.

Cooking Oil

The Shanghai Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office purchased 10,000 piculs of cooking oil from the military distribution authorities last month. 5,500 piculs were transported to Shanghai in mid-month and distributed to registered cooking oil retail stores for door-to-door sales. It is now known that there are still 4,500 piculs to be transported from Pudong to Shanghai yesterday. The same method will be used to distribute them to various cooking oil retail stores. If there are no procedural delays, the retail cooking oil stores will be able to sell them door-to-door tomorrow (9th) and the day after (10th). Each person is still limited to buying half a catty per day. In order to prevent abuses, the office has now dispatched personnel to supervise sales at various retail stores on the same day to prevent various cooking oil stores from deducting the quantity of oil sold. It is also heard that smaller oil stores will be merged into one place and sold in rotation in batches to facilitate supervision.

Salt

Salt is now controlled by Yumo Salt Company. Starting this month, salt will be fairly distributed to each sub-salt store or sauce workshop according to the population of each joint guarantee area. For example, if the population of a certain joint guarantee area is 1,000, then all the salt in that joint guarantee area can be obtained by the sales store at 1,000 catties of salt per month (based on one catty per person). However, the amount of salt that each citizen can buy is not limited to one catty and can be purchased without restriction. Yumo Salt Company is now making every effort to crack down on the private sale of salt and is reviewing the account books and sales volume of each salt store or sauce workshop to prevent fraud.

Industrial and commercial circles' movements

### Shanghai Business Pioneers: New Asia Construction Co., Ltd.

In today's Shanghai business environment where idle funds are being widely used for investment, New Asia Construction Co., Ltd. has already opened on December 1st. Praises for the company from various sectors have been detailed in various newspapers; this newspaper need not reiterate them. However, what outstanding qualities does this pioneer in Shanghai's business community possess? Let us, who are concerned with Shanghai's industrial and commercial dynamics, further introduce it to the public in this newspaper.

(1) The Founding Position and Process of New Asia Construction:

In modern countries, investment in industry and commerce generally falls into two categories: first, direct investment, which involves purchasing shares of a company as a pure investment; second, indirect investment, which involves pooling resources from various individuals to establish an organization whose business is investment. This organization then utilizes its capital according to the needs of the industrial and commercial sectors, either by starting new businesses or by supporting existing ones to promote their development, thereby indirectly obtaining profits. The convergence of these two approaches and the resulting economic prosperity are inevitable. The latter, in particular, leverages collective capital and expert perspectives to cultivate numerous industrial and commercial enterprises, while the investors themselves enjoy stable and substantial benefits. The investment scope of such organizations, which engage in indirect investment, is far broader than that of direct investment, and its security is therefore greater than that of simple investment. Consequently, the development of its business is naturally assured. Cognizant of this, prominent figures in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles raised 10 million yuan in national currency to establish New Asia Construction Co., Ltd., specializing in legitimate and safe investments. Initially, the focus is on New Asia's various factories. Once considerable success has been achieved, the remaining resources will be extended to other productive enterprises beyond the New Asia scope. It appears that the targets of New Asia Construction Co., Ltd. have been predetermined and are all businesses with well-established foundations. On one hand, it leverages existing advantages; on the other hand, it develops opportunities as they arise. Such a position can be considered foolproof, and the results are sure to be twice as effective with half the effort.

The company's founding process is also worth a brief description. Since Xu Guanqun, Zhu Boquan, Zhao Rutiao, Xu Baohua, Gu Kemin, Li Bohan, Qiu Liangrong, Shi Ziquan, Cheng Muyuan, Cao Chouyu, Shi Zuomou, Yu Daosun, and others—all of whom have been involved in founding New Asia enterprises for many years—initiated the project, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory at 1095 Xin Zha Road was used as the preparatory office. After active preparations, in addition to the promoters subscribing to 8 million yuan of shares, the remaining 2 million yuan were fully subscribed by the shareholders of various factories within the New Asia scope. By the end of the subscription period, the subscribed capital had reached as much as 50 million yuan. As a result, the number of shares subscribed by each subscriber had to be proportionally reduced, and the excess funds paid were refunded accordingly.

(2) Current and Future Investment Targets of New Asia Construction:

As mentioned earlier, New Asia Construction Co., Ltd. initially focuses on New Asia's various factories. The scope of New Asia's factories includes New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, New Asia Hygiene Material Factory, New Asia Serum Factory, New Asia Scientific Company, New Asia Enzyme Industry Factory, and Xianggang New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, among other organizations. The capital turnover of all New Asia factories, apart from their own capital, has historically relied on the continuous investment of founders and shareholders. Over the past twenty years, the business has thrived. In recent years, New Asia's pharmaceutical products have increasingly replaced imported European and American drugs. Now, with a financially strong investment organization as its backing, it is conceivable that its scope will continue to expand and its scale will become increasingly grand. (To be continued)

Upon receiving orders, district captains will post notices to inform the people. All air defense equipment must be carefully inspected, otherwise there is a risk of punishment if any deficiencies are found during the drills.

Commercial News

### Gold Ornaments Listed at 3,250 Yuan

Yesterday, the Dashin Tongxing Jewelry Store of the city's silverware industry initially listed the selling price of gold ornaments at 3,150 yuan per tael without any change. At 10:20 AM, it suddenly increased by 100 yuan to 3,250 yuan. (The buying price was reduced by varying amounts from 100 to 200 yuan). There was no formal market price among peers. Some sought to buy everywhere, pushing up the price secretly. Even at 3,250 yuan, it was difficult to obtain. This was 120 yuan higher than last Saturday. Transactions were rare. Silver ornaments were still listed at 16 yuan per tael. The inter-dealer price had already exceeded the listed price, reaching 17 yuan.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 1.4 cents. Given the recent cash crunch, it remained tight.

The Japanese military scrip remained stagnant. The inter-dealer price was 5.5535 yuan. The retail buying and selling price at silver shops and small money houses was 5.55 and 5.56 yuan.

### Bank Transfers Require Joint Signatures

The preparatory committee of the city's Banking Association, to strengthen security procedures, has stipulated that henceforth, checks (i.e., transfer slips) and transfer applications issued by member banks must be jointly signed and sealed by two employees. Existing seals used by various banks, except for those already requiring two signatures, should be changed according to the above regulations.

### Escalating Rise in Chinese Stocks

In the Chinese stock market, prices have risen steadily over the past ten days. Yesterday, the upward trend intensified. Public utility stocks were nowhere to be found for sale. In extremely few transactions, higher bid prices were seen on the blackboards. Zhabei Water and Electricity was bid up to 67.5 yuan, up 4.5 yuan from last Friday. China Merchants Steam Navigation reached 47.5 yuan, an all-time high, also up 4 yuan. The buying frenzy for Great China Matches was also intense, soaring to 335 yuan, up 8 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco rose 9 yuan to 131 yuan, also an unprecedented high. The upward trend has also expanded to department stores. New World rose 8.5 yuan, Wing On rose 4 yuan. The National Products Company was trading ex-rights, rising from 85 yuan to 90 yuan. Underwear rose 2 yuan. Wing On Textiles once reached a high of 2,035 yuan, then fell back to 1,978 yuan, still up 55 yuan. Among the small denomination textile stocks, only Xinfeng Dyeing and Printing recovered to the 20 yuan mark. Great China Manufacturing was at 10.75 yuan, Guangming Weaving at 11.5 yuan, both slightly up. Most of the others were traded sparsely and prices were flat. China Book Company in the cultural sector also traded ex-rights at 200 yuan. Commercial Press rose 10 yuan. World Book Company was down slightly by 2.5 yuan. New pharmaceutical stocks rose again and again. New Asia made a new high of 66.75 yuan from 63.5 yuan, later falling 1 yuan, still up 2.25 yuan. Minyi rose 2.5 yuan. Sino-French Company has changed to 1 yuan denomination storage certificates, increasing capital by giving two new shares for each old share, with a premium subscription of one share to get a total of five new shares. It rose from 29.5 yuan to 32.5 yuan, finally at 30 yuan, with a sharp increase. Old shares plus one yuan were still traded as usual. Five Continents has risen to the 500 yuan mark, with the most transactions. The market price list is as follows:

### Thriving Inter-Dealer Cloth Business

Due to the rise in gold prices, the selling price of factory cloth has been above the maximum price for several consecutive days. Therefore, the inter-dealer business in this street has become thriving. At the same time, there has been an improvement in actual sales, revitalizing the sluggish market. White cotton and fine cloth rose by 3 to 4 yuan per piece throughout the day. 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was at 255 yuan, Flying Goose at 250 yuan, 14-pound Earth brand at 225 yuan, 12-pound Earth brand fine cloth was at 190 yuan in the morning, and 192 yuan later in the day. Great Peng and Fugui also required 191 yuan. The rise in colored cloth was even stronger. Peach Blossom Lady brand rose to 316 yuan, Chick Factory brand single color at 310 yuan, Longevity silk at 8.2 yuan, Volleyball yarn silk at 6.6 yuan, and Three Sheep Serge at 6.95 yuan, all extremely firm.

Eastern cloth was also tight. Because there was not much stock available, the price gradually rose. The closing price of new orders for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 195 yuan, bank orders at 197 yuan, Rainbow Ball at 196.5 yuan, Flying Fish at 194.5 yuan, Yang He at 194 yuan, and Trumpet at 193.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge started at 7.85 yuan for red orders, rising to 7.89 yuan, a sharp increase of 1.1 cents per yard.

### Commercial Briefs

Longan prices have relaxed again. There has been a relatively large number of arrivals, with several hundred boxes being released successively, with price fluctuations reaching 100 to 200 yuan. Yesterday, the market released another 700 boxes, with prices 200 yuan lower than the highest price, causing market chaos. However, subsequent arrivals are temporarily lacking, so the market is relatively stable.

Dried shrimp and squid have tightened again. There have been few shipments of dried shrimp from Shantou recently, so the market is slightly tighter. The market price is 5,100 to 5,200 yuan, with lower prices for inferior goods. Dried squid from Shantou has also recovered slightly, selling for 3,200 to 3,300 yuan. There is a shortage of Xiangguan goods, with market prices requiring 3,550 yuan. The market trend is firm.

Dried tangerine peels are in stalemate. The best dried tangerine peels are from Sichuan and Guangdong, followed by Wenzhou. Recently, some goods have been transferred from Wenzhou. Although the market is short of stock, dealers are not greedy due to the tight monetary situation. Therefore, the seller's asking price is too high and there are no buyers, and the difference in prices is several hundred yuan, so no transactions have been made.

There is a slight shortage of sugar. According to the Cooperative Office, a large batch of sugar will arrive soon, but it may not be Philippine sugar and will be transferred from somewhere else. Therefore, Shanghai will not have a shortage of sugar. The retail dealers have requested an additional allocation for this month, and it is said that an additional 5,000 bags have been approved.

New iron wire trading is sluggish. Although the stock of 16 to 25 gauge wire in Shanghai is already depleted, sales are still difficult to achieve. However, yesterday the market saw activity from factory users, with sporadic transactions, but the market remained flat. The current market price for 16 to 20 gauge wire is 12,000 yuan per ton, and 14,000 yuan per ton for 21 to 25 gauge wire. Cigarette hoarders have resurfaced. Yesterday, the cigarette market saw hoarders buying in, and the prices of various brands were raised by 100 to 200 yuan compared to last Saturday. The prices were as follows: Great Britain brand at 9,200 yuan per case, Old Knife brand at 8,250 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 8,000 yuan, Little Fairy at 7,250 yuan, Five Flowers brand at 6,500 yuan, Front Gate brand (10 cigarettes) at 2,450 yuan, (50 cigarettes) at 2,550 yuan, (20 cigarettes) at 2,450 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Golden Spear brand at 3,000 yuan, Golden Building at 3,500 yuan, Red Rose at 2,700 yuan, Full Luck brand at 3,100 yuan, (20 cigarettes) at 3,150 yuan, Compass brand at 2,300 yuan, National cigarettes Great Beauty at 6,100 yuan, Golden Mouse at 3,900 yuan.

Daily necessities remain firm. Yesterday's market for daily necessities saw good sales and prices remained firm. Soap, in particular, was in short supply and prices were even higher. The prices were as follows: Making firecrackers Phoenix brand at 2,800 yuan per case, Beauty brand at 2,950 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 2,600 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 2,200 yuan. Soap: Gu Ben soap at 480 yuan, White Xiangmao at 440 yuan, Yellow Xiangmao at 380 yuan, Arrow Knife soap at 450 yuan. Candles: White Lees at 340 yuan, Monk Hat brand at 285 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 230 yuan.

### The Great East Asia War Over the Past Year

— Chen Binhe

The Great East Asia War, a full year has passed!

A year, this is a year of unprecedented change in East Asian history!

A year, this is a year of unprecedented shock in world history!

During this year, the colonial policies of British and American imperialism in the Pacific ended, the forces of British and American imperialism and their imperialist policies of squeezing and exploiting Asian nations ended, and their violence in Asia was driven out and eliminated like boiling soup poured on snow!

During this year, the countries and nations of Asia saw how Japanese soldiers, continuing after the Russo-Japanese War, in just a few months, expelled the British and American imperialist forces that had occupied the Pacific for more than a hundred years. The countries and nations of Asia began to see a new situation in the Pacific that their ancestors could not have dreamed of! The nations of Asia, nations that had always been invaded and despised, now began to be masters of Asia and masters of the Pacific themselves!

A new history has unfolded! The new situation shocked every Asian and person in the world!

What is the main driving force behind this great change that divides historical eras? The Great East Asia War!

1.  General Situation Before the War

What was the situation in the Pacific on the eve of the Great East Asia War?

First, the two largest countries in the Pacific—China and Japan—although there had been a glimmer of peace for two years, the unfortunate and painful war was still going on! In other words, this war had become the theme of the East Asian situation, and had become a good opportunity for British and American imperialists to exploit and profit from!

Second, the situation of Japan, which regarded itself as the stable force in the Pacific—the master of peace in East Asia—had reached an unprecedentedly critical moment. Anti-Japanese forces, led by British and American imperialists, began to implement a step-by-step blockade against Japan—from economic blockade to the so-called ABCD line of military blockade. Especially after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Britain and the United States could breathe a sigh of relief in the West, so their policy toward Japan—the oppression of Japan—became more active. At that time, if Japan was slightly careless, it would cause unimaginable consequences.

Third, although the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy had been established, the three countries were divided, each facing its own enemies, and could not further closely coordinate and assist each other. Germany and Italy's operations could not directly help Japan, especially after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, which instead gave Britain and the United States the opportunity to increase pressure on Japan; similarly, Japan's power could not provide much help to Germany and Italy, especially because of the treaty, Japan had to remain neutral during the German-Soviet war, and there was no other way to assist its German and Italian allies.

From Japan's standpoint before the Great East Asia War, the international situation was unfavorable, and this unfavorable situation was still developing. However, the British and American policy of blockading Japan was two-sided. On the one hand, they took advantage of the gap in the German-Soviet war and adopted a "proactive Far East policy" to intensify the blockade against Japan, with lightning and thunder, like a heavy rain about to fall. But on the other hand, figures such as the American ambassador to Japan, Grew, and especially the British ambassador to Japan, Craigie, continued to pursue a "policy of appeasement" toward Japan in a pro-Japanese manner. This intention was, of course, still to attempt to ease Japan's war preparations, and to preserve their position in the Pacific under the slogan of "maintaining the status quo in the Far East." However, this policy of "appeasement" and "blockade" being carried out in parallel also exposed the internal contradictions and weakness of war capabilities within Britain and the United States. Therefore, Japan took advantage of this gap and launched a diplomatic offensive against Britain and the United States. The visits to the United States by Nomura and Kurusu were essentially hoping for the realization of genuine peace, but Japan was not without foresight about the outcome of diplomatic failure.

However, the international situation in the months after the German-Soviet war became increasingly serious! Especially after the start of winter operations, although the German army had already besieged Moscow, it finally shifted from offensive to defensive consolidation due to the severe cold. Taking advantage of this situation, British and American imperialism attempted to use the winter to strengthen the pressure on Japan. But they did not expect, nor did they ever dream, that during this period, Japan had completed all the necessary war preparations and bravely launched the unprecedented Great East Asia War, not hesitating to fight Britain and the United States.

2.  Victorious War History and Its Significance

On December 8th, the imperial rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States was issued!

At 6:00 a.m. on the 8th, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters Army and Navy Department announced: "The Imperial Army and Navy have entered a state of war with the British and American forces in the Western Pacific"!

(1) The Naval Battle of Hawaii

Hawaii is about 3,100 nautical miles from Japan and is an important base for the US Navy's trans-Pacific offensive against Japan. The United States built the Pearl Harbor naval port, investing a huge sum of 100 million US dollars, and together with Gibraltar in the Mediterranean, it is one of the world's two major naval ports. The US Navy uses Hawaii as its apex, and Alaska's Ketchikan and Panama constitute a triangle as a Pacific defense line, a lifeline that does not allow other countries to invade, and the Japanese Navy was the first to break through this world-famous American lifeline! At 8:45 p.m. on the first day, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced the world-shaking battle results.

According to the detailed report of the Battle of Hawaii published by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters on December 18, the US Navy in this area has been completely destroyed. The main battle results are: (1) Sunk five battleships, two Class A cruisers, and two destroyers. (2) Severely damaged three battleships, two light cruisers, and two destroyers. (3) Slightly damaged one battleship and four Class B cruisers. (4) Damage to land and sea air force: 50 aircraft, 14 shot down. In addition, a Japanese submarine sank a battleship, and the Japanese side lost 29 aircraft and five special submarines that did not return.

Combining the results of this air and sea war in Hawaii, Japan used blitzkrieg tactics in a very short period, unexpectedly, and reaped unexpected results. It made the largest base for the United States to attack Japan in the Pacific lose its function, and made the threat of the United States to the Japanese mainland lose its possibility. In the history of the Great East Asia War, the victory of the Pearl Harbor surprise attack is considered the first page of the new history of East Asia.

(2) Eliminating British and American Troops Stationed in China

One of the important tools for British and American imperialism to maintain its rule in the Pacific colonies, and a national shame in modern Chinese history, was the stationing of British and American troops in China, but this humiliating history finally ended with the Great East Asia War that began on December 8.

At 11:00 a.m. on the 8th, Japanese Shanghai Marine Corps troops entered the Public Concession south of the Suzhou River. The armaments of the US Marines in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao were also disarmed on the same day. In Guangzhou, Japanese troops also entered the Shamian British Concession on the same day.

(3) Japanese Troops Enter Thailand

Before the Great East Asia War, the relationship between Japan and Thailand was known to be friendly. However, on the eve of the war, Britain and the United States stepped up their activities in Thailand, hoping to make Thailand a link in the blockade against Japan, so when the Great East Asia War broke out, Japan suddenly entered Thailand and obtained a base for attacking Malaya with Vietnam; it also isolated the land transportation links between Malaya and Burma, and threatened the Yunnan-Burma Road.

On the 11th, the Thai government announced the Japan-Thailand alliance of offense and defense. At that time, British aircraft indiscriminately bombed Thailand. On January 25 of this year, the Thai government officially declared war on Britain and the United States.

Japan found a friend in Thailand at the beginning of the Great East Asia War. From the perspective of its geographical environment, political relations, and military strength, it gave Japan a strong base for its southern strategy and political strategy. At the same time, it cut off the connection between Britain and the United States and the Chongqing government, and Burma and India began to be threatened.

(4) Naval Battle of Malaya

Within three days of the start of the war, the Japanese naval air force searched for the main force of the British Far East Fleet off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, bombed and sank the battleship Prince of Wales and the UK's most famous flagship, HMS Repulse, destroying the main force of the British Far East Fleet.

After the victory in the Battle of Malaya, like the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, it shook the general staff of Britain and the United States, causing dissatisfaction among the people of Britain and the United States with their governments, and forcing Britain and the United States to reorganize their air and naval forces and command system in Asia. Therefore, it was naturally impossible to carry out a second front in Europe.

(5) Destruction of the Central Pacific Invasion Route

At the beginning of the war, the Japanese army strongly attacked the three major military bases of Britain and the United States, such as Hawaii, Manila, and Singapore, and destroyed their main fleet in one fell swoop.

In the first week of the war, the United States' route for invading Japan in the central Pacific was thoroughly destroyed, as the Japanese Navy Minister Shimada reported to the 78th Extraordinary Diet on December 16, "The functions of all strategic and important transportation locations from Hawaii to East Asia have been destroyed."

Hawaii—Guam—Manila—Singapore—this remotely connected line was a line of encirclement given by Britain and the United States that posed a major threat to the Japanese mainland. In the past, the United States relied on its traditional naval policy, relying on its fleet and bases—the so-called two major elements of the navy—and spared no expense in completing the "Maginot Line in the Pacific," which not only the US General Staff was proud of, but also Britain had great expectations for, believing that once Japan and the United States went to war, if Britain and the United States cooperated, Japan would be easily defeated. But the reality was contrary to the ideal. This large encirclement, blockade, and attack line against Japan could not withstand a single blow from the Japanese navy and air force and completely collapsed.

(6) Occupation of Hong Kong

Britain had occupied Hong Kong for a full hundred years, which British imperialists had painstakingly managed as a major base for aggression against China. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, Hong Kong became a key point of contact between Britain and the Chongqing government.

On the 8th, the Japanese army flying squadron in southern China launched a surprise attack on the Kowloon airfield in the early morning, inflicting heavy damage. On the army side, as early as before dawn, they broke through the border, and on the night of the 9th, they had already attacked the defense line on the back of Kowloon.

On the 12th, they advanced to Kowloon, cleared out the British army, and immediately prepared to attack Hong Kong. At dawn on the 14th, they began a general offensive against Hong Kong. On the night of the 18th, Japanese troops landed on the eastern and western parts of the Hong Kong fortress. By the 20th, the western half of Hong Kong had fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. By 5:50 p.m. on the 25th, the Governor of Hong Kong requested a ceasefire and surrendered unconditionally. On the 26th, Japanese troops formally entered Hong Kong.

Hong Kong, which had been ruled by the British Empire for a hundred years, Hong Kong, which had been painstakingly managed by the British Empire for aggression against China, raised the flag of the Japanese Empire on the hundredth anniversary of Hong Kong's fall. This was the first loss of territory for the British Empire since the European War.
