Features of the New Cabinet

Vichy, 18th (Havas) – The new French cabinet is scheduled to hold its first cabinet meeting on the 20th.

Vichy, 19th (Havas) – The new cabinet formed by Laval has been established. However, its nature is completely different from the previous Vichy cabinets since the signing of the Franco-German armistice agreement the year before last. Only the position of the Head of State remains unchanged, as Marshal Pétain retains all the powers he enjoys under the July 1940 law, including the privilege of appointing the Head of Government. Laval took office yesterday, having resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister on December 13, 1940, and withdrawn from politics for sixteen months and five days. This new cabinet consists of six cabinet members and twelve state members. Its most notable feature is the absence of former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Navy Admiral Darlan, who has left the cabinet to return to his military duties. Darlan was appointed Deputy Prime Minister after Flandin resigned on February 9, 1941, and has now left politics to focus on his military role. However, according to Article 4 of the law, he remains Pétain's successor, and this provision remains valid in the event of Pétain's death or inability to perform his duties. Furthermore, in addition to his position as "heir apparent," Darlan also serves as Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy, Army, and Air Force, directly under the control of the Head of State, and will still be able to attend cabinet meetings when national defense issues are discussed. Laval's powers are more extensive than before. Before December 1940, Laval was only the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Information, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior were held by Baudouin and Marquet, respectively. Now, Laval holds the positions of Minister of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Information, and will undoubtedly have supreme authority over French domestic and foreign affairs. In terms of position, he has also changed from "Deputy Prime Minister" to "Head of Government," with all cabinet members and state members under his control. The Head of Government's Office has four assistants to handle all matters. Count de Brinon and Benoist-Méchin are in charge of foreign affairs, Marion is in charge of information, Rear Admiral Bélaud is in charge of internal affairs, Izyel handles local administration, and Bousquet handles police affairs. In addition, Rear Admiral Bélaud also has a special mission as the liaison between the government and the French Navy, Army, and Air Force. The new Minister of Education, Bonnard, is a member of the French Academy and has traveled the world, writing extensively on East Asian issues and gaining recognition. He is also a representative of Franco-German cooperation in the literary world. The Minister of Agriculture and National Food Supply is also a cabinet member, demonstrating the government's emphasis on food issues. Food is of utmost importance to the people and concerns the survival of the French people. The government will pay special attention to the production, supply, and distribution of food. The department also has a non-cabinet minister, Le Roy Ladurie, an agricultural expert with extensive research on soil science. The Minister of Finance, Cathala, is also a close confidant of Laval, who was ordered to handle the Alsace-Lorraine incident in 1935 and participated in the Laval cabinet. Lagardelle, who succeeded Peyrouton as Minister of Labor, is also an important figure in the new cabinet. In addition to being a labor expert, he also has a close personal relationship with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and is the author of "The Italian Corporate System," earning him the title of expert on Italy. The Minister of Colonies, Brévié, was formerly the Governor-General of French Indochina. The Minister of the Army, General Bridoux, was formerly an important secretary in the French government's commissioner's office in the occupied zone. The Minister of Health and Family, Dr. Grasset, is Laval's personal physician. Laval was assassinated in Versailles on July 27, 1941, while on his way to visit him. In summary, Laval's new government includes six cabinet members, twelve state members, and two secretaries-general. Only six members of the old government remain in office: Minister without Portfolio Romier, Minister of Justice Barthélemy, General Representative for Franco-German Economic Relations Benoist-Méchin, Undersecretary of Intelligence Marion, Assistant to the Head of Government Benoist-Méchin, and Rear Admiral Bélaud. The five members who failed to retain their positions include Minister of the Interior Pucheu, Minister of Agriculture Caziot, Minister of Finance Bouthillier, and Minister of Labor Belin.

The Cabinet Reshuffle in France is Influenced by Foreign Factors

Vichy, 18th (Havas) – The most important event of the week is the change of the French cabinet. Marshal Pétain met with Laval several times between the 26th of last month and the 2nd of this month. Afterwards, Laval told the press that "France's diplomatic position has become increasingly serious, so it is necessary to talk with the Head of State." Afterwards, they met again, with Deputy Prime Minister Darlan participating, and it was decided that Laval would form a new cabinet according to "new principles." After visiting political figures in Paris, Laval came here to continue negotiations on forming the cabinet. Yesterday, the old cabinet held its last meeting and submitted its resignation to Marshal Pétain. Admiral Darlan relinquished all political responsibilities and devoted himself to the military position of Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy, Army, and Air Force, directly under the control of the Head of State. This afternoon, Laval's cabinet was officially established. Political figures have been speculating about the direction of French foreign policy in the future. A major change has occurred in the diplomatic relations between the United States and France. After the United States announced that it would establish a consulate general in Brazzaville, the center of French Equatorial Africa, the French government protested to the United States. The U.S. response was released on the 13th of this month, but the French government said it could not accept it. French Ambassador to the United States Henry-Haye notified the State Department of this on the 16th. Furthermore, the reorganization of the French cabinet has forced President Roosevelt to recall U.S. Ambassador to France Admiral Leahy for questioning, although the embassy remains open and is managed by a chargé d'affaires. All of this shows that the United States has prejudged the future policy of the French government before understanding the future direction of French policy. International political figures are closely watching the development of the new French cabinet, as the reorganization of the French government was clearly influenced by the international situation and did not originate from domestic politics.

### French Head of State Pétain to Deliver Broadcast Speech Tonight: Explaining the Significance of the Cabinet Reshuffle and Transferring Powers to the Head of Government

Vichy, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – It is claimed here that General Pétain, originally scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech tonight, has postponed it to 7 p.m. tomorrow (2 a.m. on the 20th, Shanghai time).

London, 19th (Reuters) – According to a broadcast station controlled by Germany, Pétain's speech has been postponed to the 20th, and Laval will also make a statement at that time.

Vichy, 18th (Havas) – Marshal Pétain is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech on the evening of the 20th to explain the significance of the government reshuffle to the country. This afternoon, Undersecretary of Information Marion made a written statement to the press, saying that "The Head of State and Mr. Laval have met several times and have conducted a general review of the overall political situation. The Head of State has also repeatedly consulted with Admiral Darlan. After these meetings, the Head of State deeply felt that the current form of government is no longer able to adapt to the needs of France in domestic and foreign affairs. According to the law, Admiral Darlan is the successor of the Head of State, so the Head of State decided to appoint Darlan as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Navy, Army, and Air Force, but the Commander-in-Chief still has the right to attend cabinet meetings when issues within his jurisdiction are involved. In addition, in order to increase administrative efficiency and strengthen the government, the Head of State decided to set up the position of 'Head of Government,' which will be held by Mr. Laval, so that under the highest guidance of the Head of State, he will be responsible for handling French domestic and foreign affairs. In addition to being responsible to the Head of State, Laval will also report all his initiatives and facilities to the Head of State at any time. In addition to serving as 'Head of Government,' Laval also serves as the Minister of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Information, and will be assisted by various state members." At the same time, the government gazette promulgated an order declaring that the Head of State has relieved him of his duties as Head of Government, stating that "According to the provisions of the July 1940 law, the Head of State has decided that all domestic and foreign affairs of the country shall be handled by one Head of Government, who shall be appointed by the Head of State and be responsible to the Head of State. In addition to submitting a list of cabinet members to the Head of State for approval, he shall also report all facilities to the Head of State at any time."

The British attach great importance to this, and calls for the immediate opening of a second front in Europe are rising.

### Germany and the Soviet Union Reorganizing Their Front Lines in Preparation for the Summer War: Aircraft and Tanks are Increasing; the Spring Offensive is Just a Catchy Term

Kuibyshev, 19th (Reuters) – There is little progress or retreat in the Eastern Front. The military deployments and the opportune time and place of Germany and the Soviet Union are all in a transitional period. Although the snow and ice have melted, the roads are muddy and it will not be possible to march until six weeks later. The so-called spring offensive is just a catchy term. Both sides are actively preparing for the summer war. On the front lines, both sides are trying their best to use the current transitional period to reorganize their front lines. However, the actual actions are not clear. What is known is that the number of aircraft used by the German side has been increasing. On the land, the number of tanks of both armies has increased greatly. The German side also uses tank formations to cover infantry counterattacks from time to time. In winter, the German army mostly engages in positional warfare, and the Red Army has to trek across snowy fields. Although there is no need for such arduous actions at present, it is quite difficult to maintain an offensive in the mud. The mud in the Soviet wilderness is a cause for great concern.

Ukraine Front, 18th (Havas) – The situation on the Eastern Front has not changed drastically recently, but the German side is still actively preparing for a large-scale offensive in the future. According to news from the front, 80% of the fresh troops originally scheduled to be transferred to the Eastern Front have arrived at their designated locations, and large quantities of military supplies are arriving every day. The so-called spring offensive is expected to be launched in the near future.

Berlin, 18th (Havas) – German military circles say that the Eastern Front has been calm this past week, because the ground has melted and the mud is everywhere, so there has been no large-scale military action.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the German High Command, the Soviet 33rd Army in the central sector of the Eastern Front has been almost completely annihilated. The commander of the army is General Yefremov. The German army surrounded the Soviet 113th Division, 116th Division, and 338th Division, as well as a newly formed infantry division and other units. After six days of fierce fighting, they were all annihilated by the German army. The Soviet army lost a total of 130 tanks, 385 artillery pieces, and 176 vehicles in the three months of fighting there. 11,355 people were captured and 57,000 were killed. The German army captured 170 villages and 1,800 fortifications. The Soviet army lost 24 aircraft.

### Gandhi Writes an Appeal: Eliminating Internal Disputes, Hoping for Harmony Between Hindus and Muslims, Otherwise Independence Cannot Be Achieved

Bombay, 19th (Reuters) - Gandhi published a signed article in his own newspaper, "Harijan Weekly," today, criticizing the British proposals for India. He stated, "It is ridiculous for the British to want all circles in India to accept this proposal. It is said that we do not need to silently remember the mistakes of the British. If we can take care of ourselves, then the British will also know how to take care of themselves. We have many mistakes or shortcomings. Why should we scold the British because of our own obstacles? If we cannot resolve the disputes between groups, then it will be difficult to achieve independence. If one side or both sides believe that these disputes do not need to be resolved and that independence can be achieved, then the group disputes will never be resolved. So-called unsolvable events can be resolved in two ways: one is the superior strategy of non-violence, and the other is the strategy of violence. All those who care about freedom must choose one of the two. I think the leaders have made a choice, but the general public has not yet decided. They should think about the issue of unity themselves and take non-violent action. If Hindus and Muslims believe that it is possible and necessary to live together, then they will be able to be friendly with each other. It is doubtful whether those who advocate dividing India into two countries or dividing India according to groups can live in harmony. If most Muslims believe that the place where they live is a separate country and that they have nothing in common with Hindus, then there is no power in the world that can stop them from thinking so. If they want to divide India based on this, then they will definitely want to achieve the goal of division. Unless Hindus fight against it. From my personal point of view, the other side has already secretly begun to prepare for this, which is also a path to suicide, because each side may need the help of Britain or outsiders. If so, then independence will say goodbye to India forever. I dare not silently think that this kind of situation will become a reality, and I do not want to witness the realization of this matter. I hope to witness us fighting for independence together. In the process of seeking independence, we will forget our disputes, otherwise, I am afraid that we will only have time to argue among ourselves."

### Nehru Explains the Future of India

Washington, 18th - Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, wrote an article in Fortune magazine stating that the recent visit to India by General Chiang Kai-shek and his wife was not only of historical significance but also allowed us to have an understanding of the scene of cooperation between India and China in the future world to promote their own and global welfare.

### Jewelry Theft Occurs in the Swedish Capital

Stockholm, 19th (Havas) - A jewelry theft occurred here last night. Some of the jewelry belonged to Count Fersen, a friend of the late French Queen Marie Antoinette. The value is between 50,000 and 100,000 francs, bordering on 3,000 kilometers. Living in peace for thousands of years, neither country has taken aggressive actions, but during these long years, the two countries have had close cultural and commercial contacts. Nehru went on to say that India is not begging others, but is demanding complete equality in all aspects and firmly believes that it can live with people in other regions in the new world and fulfill its due responsibilities. Nehru was very critical of the British, and he said that one thing is certain, that no matter what the outcome of the war, India will resist all attempts to rule India. Any peace that cannot be resolved, the Indian question must be lasting. Nehru believes that the solution to this problem should be the primary responsibility of the United Kingdom, but its impact will not only affect British India but also this war. No country can ignore India's present and future.

### Mercantile Bank and Citibank Commence Third Withdrawal Today; American Express, Dutch Bank, and HSBC Have Already Started Successively; Banque Belge d'Extrême-Orient Has Commenced Fourth Withdrawal; Chase Bank Will Process Soon

The third withdrawals from the Allied banks in this port will be processed successively. Banque Belge d'Extrême-Orient, American Express, Dutch Bank, and HSBC have already started. Mercantile Bank and Citibank are scheduled to start today (20th). In addition, Chase Bank is expected to pay the third batch of deposits soon, while Banque Belge d'Extrême-Orient started the fourth withdrawal a week ago.

Withdrawal Method

The withdrawal methods for the third withdrawal are the same for all banks. Each bank will first transfer the amount of the third batch of deposits that each depositor is allowed to withdraw into the deposit book opened by each depositor with the Japanese bank responsible for liquidation during the second withdrawal. The so-called depositors include all Allied nationals, neutral nationals, and Chinese depositors with deposits of less than 10,000 yuan. After the transfer, this batch of deposits becomes a Japanese bank deposit, but all transactions are still handled at the original Allied bank. All neutral nationals or Chinese can withdraw this Japanese bank deposit without restriction. In other words, it can be withdrawn all at once, while Allied nationals are limited to withdrawing 500 yuan per household per week.

Amounts of Each Bank

The amount of the third withdrawal is 20% of the amount payable by Banque Belge d'Extrême-Orient on February 6, minus 2,000 yuan, 25% for HSBC, and 30% for Dutch Bank, Mercantile Bank, and Citibank. According to the amount of the second withdrawal, Banque Belge d'Extrême-Orient was 30% of the amount payable on December 6 of last year, minus 2,000 yuan, 10% for American Express, and 50% for HSBC, Dutch Bank, Mercantile Bank, and Citibank. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the total amount of deposits allowed to be withdrawn by each depositor of the Allied banks, in addition to the first withdrawal of 2,000 yuan, is 75% of the amount payable on December 6, minus 2,000 yuan for HSBC, 80% for Mercantile Bank, Dutch Bank, and Citibank, 30% for American Express, and Banque Belge d'Extrême-Orient has been fully approved after processing 50% of the fourth withdrawal.

Approval of US Currency

The safety deposit boxes that are open also include HSBC, Mercantile, Chase, and Banque Belge d'Extrême-Orient. HSBC and Mercantile Bank have also been approved to withdraw US currency from the safety deposit boxes. However, what each depositor actually withdraws is not US currency, but Chinese legal currency. This US currency will be returned to each depositor in legal currency at an exchange rate of 5.55 yuan per US dollar. However, the current price of US dollar bills is higher than this exchange rate. It is reported that the difference will be calculated based on the market price of US dollar bills on the 16th of this month and transferred to the Yokohama Specie Bank and Mitsui Bank, two Japanese commercial banks that are liquidating the two banks, as new deposits. All neutrals and Chinese can withdraw this new deposit without restriction, and Allied nationals are limited to withdrawing 500 yuan per week.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Resumes Passenger Service; Number of People Returning Home Increases Sharply

Since the Intelligence Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession announced the cancellation of the half-price preferential treatment for returning home from May 1, the ships between Shanghai and Ningbo have resumed carrying passengers. The number of ships traveling between the two places has recently become more frequent. Changshan of the East Asia Shipping Company and Haitong of the Zhejiang East Shipping Company loaded passengers and cargo at the Swire Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession and the Yangtse Wharf in Yangshupu yesterday afternoon and sailed to Ningbo. Hualin of the Shanghai-Yu Company will also sail to Ningbo this afternoon, and Wanji Wheel will export tomorrow. In the past three or four months, many people from Yu who lived in Shanghai have returned to their hometowns to live. However, in the past week, because the ships did not carry passengers and detoured to Dinghai or Shenjiamen, there were many twists and turns, so few people returned home. Today, the ships have resumed passenger service, so the number of people returning home is endless.

### A Russian Falsely Claims Magic to Deceive Vegetable Vendors

A Russian, Tisinov, residing at 139 Avenue Pétain, went to a nearby vegetable market at 11:00 AM on the 7th of this month to buy vegetables worth 20 yuan from Wang Songyue, a local who sells vegetables. When he asked him to go home to get the money, he only gave him a fake 5-yuan bill. When he couldn't use it and negotiated with him, the Russian, thinking that Wang, the vegetable vendor, was honest and easy to deceive, falsely claimed that he had magic and could soak the banknotes in potion, and turn them into twice their value within three days, so he asked Wang to pay 500 yuan in legal currency, and then it would be increased to 1,000 yuan. Wang was fooled by him and told his relatives about the matter when he returned home, and reported it to the Hongkou Police Department, who sent detective Ma Guiliang to arrest the Russian and prosecute him for fraud. He was sentenced to two months of imprisonment yesterday as a warning.

### Two Criminals Arrested for Impersonation and Intimidation

Two men from Ningbo, Jing Yong (28 years old) and Li Heming (24 years old), pretended to be staff members of the Food Management Office at No. 2 Fuxing Road, French Concession, a month ago, and extorted more than 1,000 yuan in legal currency from Yuan Xin Tai Cotton Cloth Store at No. 175 Avenue Dubail, Xie Tai Cheng Cotton Cloth Store at No. 337 Rue du Marché, Shen He Tai Tobacco Store at No. 91 of the same road, Da Tong Southern Goods Store, and Xin Da Chang Cloth Store at No. 154 Rue Conty, and fled without a trace. Yesterday, the French Police Department received a tip that the criminal was hiding at No. 102 Ningyu Street. Chief Detective Le Sixiang and Detective Jiang Zhongjia went to the address and arrested Jing Yong. Li Heming was arrested in San Duo Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, and taken to the police station for handling.

### Protecting Animals, But "Humans Are Not as Good as Dogs"!

The difference between humans and animals is said to be only "a little," but in reality, the difference is huge. Among animals, only humans have thoughts and language, so they can be the spirit of all things. Since humans and animals are both animals, they have a relationship from the beginning when they lived on the ground. According to modern people's conjecture, in the beginning, humans and animals were afraid of each other. Gradually, human evolution, intelligence, and weaving opened up, taking the upper hand, and their psychology changed from fear to tolerance, and they adopted certain kinds of animals for their use, naturally creating a kind of affection, so animals also have the beautiful name of "dumb friends of mankind."

In the middle of the last century, the status of animals changed greatly. Some countries claiming to be civilized and advanced solemnly formulated laws, stipulating how to treat animals well and not to go against them. This is another matter in international Shanghai; however, as early as forty years ago, a Foreigners' Animal Protection Association was established in Shanghai, with many members, including people from various countries. If the German and English names of the association are translated, it means "Shanghai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals," so you can know the purpose of the association. Unexpectedly, in this year when humans are not as good as dogs, there is still a unique animal protection group in Shanghai.

The Shanghai Animal Protection Association has no animal protection laws to back it up, and it has no ample funds for use, but it is still enthusiastically working to prevent cruelty to animals. Its purpose is pure, and its intention is compassionate, so it should not be considered "superfluous" by people.

The association has a committee to preside over all association affairs, and it sends personnel to inspect poultry farms, slaughterhouses, zoos, and public markets; it supervises the loading and unloading of poultry and animals and the auction of horses, etc., and conducts investigations into cruelty and other situations. If a lawsuit is caused, it also sends personnel to the court to argue eloquently. In addition, the public can send animals that are not adopted, and the Animal Protection Association will also accept them. The association is most concerned about protecting animals from abuse, but at the same time, it also tries its best to prevent animals from dying tragically, so it tries its best to find suitable new owners for animals that are not adopted. Sometimes, when it receives dying animals and no one is willing to adopt them, and the association does not have sufficient funds to raise them on its own, it has to pay for them to be sent to a veterinary surgeon for painless disposal for the sake of humanity and public health.

Although domestic animals do not have thoughts and language, they are very loyal to the owners who raise them. Since ancient times, there have been countless loyal horses and righteous dogs who sacrificed their lives for their owners; therefore, mankind should also be compassionate to them and should not expose their love of killing.

Finally, it can also be reported that all the work of the Animal Protection Association never charges the public, nor does it receive subsidies from the authorities. All the funds are donated by members and supporters, but the annual income is very small, only about 1,000 yuan. Since the funds are not sufficient, the work is of course subject to obstacles everywhere. (Min)

### Hua Zhong's Exchange with Northern Regions: Agreement on Goods Exchange Established Last Month, Comprising Three Parts

After the cessation of Shanghai's foreign trade, there were no solutions for both the output of local products and the import of foreign goods, which constitutes a major serious problem. According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, an agreement on the exchange of goods between Central China and various northern regions was reached at the end of last month by the relevant parties. It is divided into three parts: Central China to North China, Central China to Mengjiang, and Central China to Manchuria. A summary of it is translated as follows:

Central China to North China

It is noteworthy that the current agreement completely incorporates the Suhuai region into North China. The main points of the agreement are: In addition to seeking the smooth flow of overall goods exchange, the principle of balanced revenue and expenditure will be adopted, while ensuring appropriate flexibility in the exchange. Special yen will be used in principle for exchange settlement, with military notes and Shanghai exchange also being used. The exchange agreement is divided into two parts: One is the exchange of specific goods, for which the Central and North China authorities will seek comprehensive planning to ensure the full realization of the plan. The second is the general exchange of goods, for which both parties will strive to achieve its realization.

(A) Goods Transferred from North China: Specific goods include coal, iron pyrite, pig iron, soda ash, etc. General goods include glass, Chinese medicine, sesame, soybeans, peanuts, peanut oil, and other agricultural products.

(B) Goods Transferred from Central China: Specific goods include flour, fertilizer, typing paper, sugar, tobacco products, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, silk, rayon cloth, tea. General goods include cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, domestic medicinal materials, metal products, stationery, soap, sundries, etc. Efforts will be made to lower the prices of goods transferred in and out. Efforts will be made to streamline transportation. The exchange amount and goods between Central China and Mengjiang are roughly the same as last year. Goods transferred from Mengjiang are mainly medicinal materials and coal, while goods transferred from Central China are mainly cotton yarn, cotton cloth, flour, and fur.

Central China to Manchuria

Goods transferred from Manchuria include designated soybeans, soybean oil, pulp, wood, matchsticks, soda ash, dyes, and paint. Goods transferred from Central China include designated flour, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, tea, tobacco leaves, and miscellaneous foodstuffs. The settlement method is calculated in Japanese yen monthly, and the transfer prices are mutually determined based on controlled prices. Military Allocation and Xuzhou Area: According to the same newspaper, the military note goods allocation association and the Central China transfer association in the Xuzhou area have established a goods exchange agreement, totaling approximately 3 million yen, to be cleared by the end of May. The types and quantities of exchange items are as follows:

### Football Match in the Rain: China United Loses to St. Francis, Problem with Offside at 2-5

The charity football semi-finals were held at Yiyuan yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, despite the rain. The audience was still crowded. As a result of the game, China United lost to St. Francis 2-5. The first half ended in a 2-2 draw. However, in the second half, there was dissatisfaction with the referee Sheffield due to the offside goal issue, which almost led to an unpleasant ending. Later, the game was completed. St. Francis's Panton scored the first goal. China United's Han Longhai, with the help of Yuan Kuntian, scored a goal back. At 17 minutes, Greenburg fouled in the penalty area. Ade missed the penalty kick, which was a pity. At 20 minutes, Foon passed to James Watt, and Qin Bixiao failed to save it. Then, Jia Youliang got the ball and went in alone. Remydi was careless and incomplete. Youliang rushed into the net with the ball. The first half ended in a 2-2 draw. In the second half, Ade penetrated deep alone three minutes after the start and swept the ball in. The referee ruled it offside and did not count it. At nine minutes, Edward Warren, the linesman Hale, waved the flag to indicate offside, but Sheffield did not blow the whistle. Foon shot and scored with one kick. The China United players protested, but to respect sportsmanship, they continued to play until the end of the game. St. Francis scored two more goals, resulting in a final score of 5-2.

### Charity Basketball Match: Mixed Team Wins Against North China Yesterday

The charity basketball match initiated by the Innovation Club was held at the Guogiang Middle School court on Aiwenyi Road yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Before the match, there was also the Mengxian Cup basketball semi-final. South China played against Team V. Team V unfortunately lost to Qiangxing 14-6 the day before. Yesterday, they were defeated by South China again, and their hopes for the championship were dashed. This weekend, South China and Qiangxing, the two winning teams, will still compete for the title at the original venue. In the main event, North China, due to unfamiliarity with the venue, was poorer than the Mixed team. In the first half of the Mengxian Cup, South took the lead with 15-7. As a result, they won against Team V with 18-10. In the main event, He Xinjiang's Huang Peijun scored the first goal. Bender scored two out of three shots. Wang Xuewu followed suit and led with 15-6.

### Letter

To the Honorable Editor,

Having read the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 19th of this month, I saw a piece of news titled "A Fellow Townsman is Accused of Theft for Selling Canned Food," and there are several sentences that involve our store. I am writing to request a correction and ask for your understanding. Firstly, it says, "After investigation, the stolen goods were found to have been sold to the owner of the He Cheng Confectionery." The buyer who sold to the water shop was actually "Zheng Jiao Ji," not Wei Chi Zhao's family. Secondly, it says, "When Xiao Hecheng Wang was arrested, he had already fled upon hearing the news, and the store was investigated." The fact is that Xiao Hecheng Store has been open for decades and has never been called upon by the court or the police. Our store's small industry association representative and the store owner accompanied the detectives to the police station. From this, it can be seen that our store has no intention of evading guilt. Our store purchased the goods with proper procedures and has all the evidence. Why would we receive stolen goods?

Respectfully,

Xiao Cheng Manager Bei Qingming

### Hua Stocks Initially Stable and Promising

Last week, due to weak yarn prices and military notes, confidence in Chinese stocks waned. Buyers were hesitant, while sellers were eager to sell due to tight credit conditions. As a result, the trend was sluggish, transactions were mediocre, and prices were difficult to rise. However, on Friday, the situation changed. Military notes rose from hovering, and yarn prices also soared. Moreover, Chinese stock prices had been weak for several days. The intention of investment buyers to enter the market at low prices became strong. Transactions gradually increased, and the market atmosphere became lively. However, it is still difficult to achieve stability. Among the various stocks that changed last week, financial stocks such as Continental, Central South, and Salt Industry were mostly brought to North China to profit from the high exchange rates between Tianjin and Shanghai. The transaction price of Continental Bank rose from 2,400 yuan to 4,425 yuan; Central South Bank rose by 5 yuan. The Central and Transportation Banks, however, declined by 5 yuan. The Dahua Match Company, an industrial stock, saw its market price soar due to the rise in match prices. The transaction price was as high as 147.5 yuan. However, due to profit-taking, the price turned weak, but confidence remained strong, and the decline was limited. The Tianchu MSG stock was scarce, with demand exceeding supply. The transaction price rose from 315 yuan to 330 yuan. Department store stocks such as Wing On, Sincere, and China Underwear hovered in a narrow range because the number of buying and selling shares was equal. China National Goods rose by 5 yuan. In the cultural sector, the World New Stock was heavily absorbed, full of vitality, and the market order rose linearly, with a total increase of 3 yuan and 25 cents. Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company both lingered. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, China-France New Stock rose first and then weakened, eventually stabilizing. New Asia New Stock hovered between one and two yuan. In the textile industry, the transaction price of Wing On Textile rose from 350 yuan to 390 yuan, and the purchase price of Da Feng Dyeing and Weaving rose by 25 yuan. The reasons for the increase were all due to the rise in yarn prices.

Looking ahead to this week's trends, the number of shares in the market has not been fully replenished. Although there are occasional sales, most of them are retail investors, and major investors remain inactive. Since the establishment of the Portuguese Stock Brokerage Association, some investors have other options. However, the majority still focus on Chinese stocks, so there is no sign of a downturn in the future of Chinese stocks.

### Foreign Stocks Find Life in Desperation: What to Do When Spilled Water Cannot Be Recovered

The situation of foreign stocks last week, in terms of the overall trend, continued the previous week's rise and expanded further. The market momentum became more active day by day. The number of transactions increased significantly every day. Detailed statistics: Due to the lack of a formal market, it is difficult to have a basis. Roughly speaking: There should be about 150,000 shares, of which industrial stocks accounted for 90%, and rubber stocks only accounted for 10%. Among the industrial stocks, the trading of small-value stocks such as Ewo Yarns, Sinwo Yarns, Ewo Brewery, China Textile, Paper Industry, and Shanghai Woolen was the most frequent. The price increase was also severe. China Textile Company announced that any shares of the company held by Chinese people in the name of foreigners and purchased before December 8 can be registered with the company and have the hope of applying for transfer. The market was energized, and shareholders began to receive protection. At the same time, it is expected that other companies will follow suit, so stocks in the name of foreigners, which could not be traded in the past or had to be discounted by 30% of the market price, are now readily accepted by the public, and the rising trend has spread universally.

### Cloth First Drops and Then Recovers

The cloth market this week first dropped and then recovered; as a result, it has resumed rising. On Monday, affected by negative rumors, low military notes, and falling yarn prices, the industry was crowded, leading to a decrease in buyers and a sluggish situation. On Tuesday, Dong Pi Bank absorbed stocks, and the market changed from stable to rising, but the transaction of factory cloth was sluggish and did not improve. By Thursday, due to the rapid rise of Double Horse Factory orders, the cotton industry exchange was preparing to resume business, and there were rumors of increased import and export duties at customs. Customers in this street restocked, and the market saw a rally. After Friday, the upward trend became more intense. Factory and warehouse orders were extremely popular, and cloth prices soared, continuing to increase sharply. The situation was very prosperous, and the excitement continued until the weekend. Therefore, various brands of coarse and fine cotton cloth all set historical records this week.

Compared with last week, heavy-weight coarse cloth rose sharply by 8 yuan to 13 yuan; fine cloth rose by 3 yuan to 5 yuan; the fluctuations throughout the week were quite large.

In general, since yarn prices have risen sharply, the cost of weaving is bound to increase, and the supply of fine yarn fabrics will be more tightly controlled due to the lack of raw cotton imports. Therefore, if there are no other unfavorable factors in the future, the overall trend will be more likely to rise than to fall. However, the current movement is not easy, and actual sales are lacking, so the rising trend also has a considerable limit. Furthermore, the silver issue is also a matter for discussion.

### This Week's Shareholders' Meetings

1.  Kwang Hua Oil Company will hold a shareholders' meeting at the company at 25th (this Saturday) afternoon. Stock transfers will be suspended prior to the meeting.

2.  Sincere Company will hold a shareholders' meeting at the Green Treasure Theater at 26th (this Sunday) morning. Stock transfers will be suspended prior to the meeting.

3.  Changfeng Shipping Company will hold a shareholders' meeting at the Dachang Company at 26th (this Sunday) afternoon.

### Ghost · Old Man

— Xiao Pei

One evening, I happened to walk into the cemetery. It's ridiculous to say, the night before, I was fascinated by a mysterious book, so I came to find the shadow of my ghost. I wanted to ask about the question of whether there is a soul; these days, I, a believer in the soul, am a bit sad, the sadness of the disillusionment of faith. In Tsarist Russia, a serf who died still bore the words "soul," but the living now seem to be very lonely. However, to show a little loyalty to my own beliefs, I came to visit the ghost, I am looking for an answer.

I'm a little tired from walking. I don't know if the ghost lives in the wilderness, or if we just don't recognize each other, in short, I didn't find the friend I imagined. I just saw a foreign old man, was he crying? Sitting in the cemetery, looking at the twilight, thinking about his old age, he should not be able to restrain his tears. His hands were on the cold marble, was he thinking of someone's gentle hand? Life and death are two extremes, and the distance between them is so close!

The old man might be able to answer my question? So, I went over and started talking to him. He said I was a strange young man, believing in some mysterious things; I said I had a passionate love for life, and I believed in some real things more. He just muttered, "Strange young man."

Leaving the cemetery, he asked me to go to a movie, a musical, full of fantasy Viennese atmosphere. It's just that when I came out of the theater, I found that there were still unhealed tears on the old man's face. What reason is there to cry? Competing with time until his hair is white, does he still have so many tears?

I was afraid of hurting the old man's dignity, I didn't want to ask, but I finally asked. "Didn't you see it, Vienna, poetic Vienna, musical Vienna." The old man's voice was a little trembling, a little sobbing. "Are you Austrian!" I asked him. "I am a person without nationality."

There is no need to ask any further, I already understand. Living on the earth, do we still not understand the loneliness of my world?

After crossing a road, the old man turned the corner, we said goodbye. I watched the old man's faltering shadow. So, I hurried on my way too. The lights are dim, the road is rugged; thinking about the old man and the world, I remembered the friend I imagined again.

War

### War God and the Devil of Disease

— Wang Xuan

Wherever the God of War visits, the Devil of Disease will surely follow, as if shadow and form are inseparable. Throughout history, every war has produced and spread diseases, and the severity of the situation can be seen from the impact on the military and civilians.

Soldiers in combat often encounter great difficulties, such as long-distance forced marches, followed by fierce battles day and night, exhaustion of energy and fatigue, or injuries, lack of adequate shelter, and inadequate food, all of which are sufficient to weaken their combat power. Moreover, troops often gather in one place, and if they get sick from eating or drinking carelessly or indulging in entertainment, it is easy to spread. As for the general public, even if they are not surrounded by an isolated city, they often suffer from food shortages, polluted water, and the destruction of grains. Since food and drink are poor and they do not keep clean, various poisonous germs take the opportunity to move around.

During the World War from 1914 to 1918, at least in the war zone of the Western Hemisphere, the number of soldiers who died of disease was certainly less than the number who died in battle, but this may be the first phenomenon in human history; because in previous wars, the situation was the opposite, such as in the Boer War at the end of the last century, the number of people who died of dysentery was far more than the number who died from bullets. The proportion of deaths from disease in the First World War was greatly reduced, which is of course the victory of modern medicine, which has slightly reduced the extent to which modern military weapons harm mankind, but in more distant war zones, medicine may have been on the verge of failure, especially refugees and farmers in eastern Europe and Asia, who suffered from typhus, dysentery, plague and other plagues after the fire of war. The number of deaths is countless. Among the infectious diseases during the war, typhus may be the most widespread and has the longest history, and diarrhea is also a common disease for troops. Also, typhus, war, famine, poverty, and crowding seem to be related, and there are more civilian patients than military patients.

Before the First World War, typhus was rarely found in Western Europe; today, Poland, Turkey and the farther East still have patients. During the First World War, the harm caused by typhus was quite alarming. In Poland, there were 400,000 patients, of whom 40,000 died. Russian prisoners brought the disease to Germany and Austria. The Serbian army was not harmed at first. Soon after, they captured the city of Valjevo on the Bosnian border from Austria and captured 40,000 prisoners, of whom 3,000 were sick or injured, and many suffered from typhus. At that time, Serbia urgently needed labor, and sent the prisoners to work in various parts of the country, so typhus spread rapidly and could not be contained, killing 100,000 people, and at least two-thirds of the Austrian prisoners died from this disease.

After the Great War, refugees moved in large numbers, first from Poland to Russia, and then back to Poland, and typhus broke out again, becoming a major threat to European health. Fortunately, it was contained by the League of Nations Health Department. How many people died this time has not been determined? However, 185 staff members of the League of Nations Health Department also suffered from this disease while working in Poland, sacrificing their lives to prevent the spread of the typhus demon.

During the Crusades in the 11th century, there was also a plague, but it was not possible to determine which infectious disease it was. After Babai Luocan led a large army to occupy Rome in 1167, infectious diseases were rampant and the entire army died.

During the Thirty Years' War from 1618 to 1648, the plague spread, and countless people died of typhus and dysentery, because the population of Central Europe was reduced to 13 million, and no more than 500,000 died of injuries.

It is not known where syphilis originated, but it has a very close relationship with the army. It was not taken seriously at first, but by the end of the 15th century, when Charles VIII sent troops on an expedition and stationed in the city of Naples, syphilis was extremely rampant, and later the discharged soldiers spread it throughout Europe. According to records, of the 5,000 Swiss mercenaries in the army at that time, only 1,500 reached Naples, and only 100 of them returned home later, and the rest died of syphilis.

Regarding the comparative figures of those killed in battle and those who died of disease, there are several more to record. During the Crimean War, 4,600 British soldiers were killed in battle and 17,500 died of disease, and 20,240 French soldiers were killed in battle and 75,000 died of disease. All of this proves that in countless wars in history, the number of people who died from germs is ultimately greater than the number of ghosts under weapons.

Children

### Children's Zoo

— Zhang Qiao

There is a zoo in the Bronx Park in New York that is specially designed for children. This zoo does not prohibit adults from entering, nor does it welcome adults. Because there is a low bridge at the entrance of the park, children can move freely under the bridge, but adults with a height of five feet have to squat down to enter, otherwise they cannot enter. There are guinea pigs, cats, dogs, etc. in the park.

Seeing that Fei Changhe was willing to let Cui Zhen go with him, Wei Cheng was delighted and said, "Cui Zhen, did you hear what your uncle said?" Fei Changhe shook his head, which was covered by a copper basin hat, like a poet drawing circles, and laughed, "Young Master Ye, I have something else to say here. Cui Zhen is twenty-one years old this year and hasn't had her birthday yet. She was nine years old when her parents died and came to my house. Twenty-one minus nine is twelve, that's twelve years. In my house, there's no good food, no good dishes, and no good clothes for her to wear, but we still raised her to be so big. People even say she's good-looking. I think she's even prettier than the young girls in my family. Young Master Ye, now she's going with you. I was thinking of asking her to come back tomorrow, but it doesn't matter if she doesn't come back. The important thing is that people don't criticize me. It doesn't matter either. Young Master Ye, haha, my niece has eaten twelve years' worth of food in my house." Wei Cheng saw him hesitating, as if he had something he couldn't say, so he said, "Do you want me to pay for the food that Cui Zhen ate in your house? That's fine, just tell me." Fei Changhe's eyebrows moved with his laughter, and he clapped his hands together, saying, "Young Master Ye can say such things, but I, Fei Changhe, cannot. Since Young Master Ye is instructing me to take the money, I dare not refuse. Anyway, it's been twelve years, so it can be calculated. How many meals a day, how many days a year, Young Master Ye, give as you please. If I argue about more or less, I am not Fei Changhe. But I don't like it if people say I sold my niece to the Ye family. This must be made clear."

Cui Zhen was waving her hand at Wei Cheng again, but Wei Cheng didn't see it. He was listening to Fei Changhe while reaching into his pocket, and he pulled out twenty-odd paper bills, saying, "I know you need money, but I don't have much money on me. Take it and use it first. We can talk about the big problem of the food expenses when you come to my house in a day or two. Is that okay?" (54)
