However, the reason why the United States has not yet taken significant action is due to various difficulties that still need to be overcome. At the beginning of the Pacific War, the United States knew that the Japanese army would attack the Netherlands East Indies, so it immediately began preparations. It is currently strengthening the strength of the Pacific front. When I left the United States, reinforcements had already set out, and some had already arrived. The main force of the Netherlands East Indies army is in Java, but the defense plan of the Netherlands East Indies does not lie in the outer islands. Today, we must persist in fighting. Allied troops are already here, and supplies will continue to arrive.

### Fifteen Mysterious Aircraft Fly Over the U.S. West Coast; Air Raid Alert Issued in Washington

Washington, 27th, Reuters dispatch: Secretary of War Stimson declared to the press yesterday that from 3:12 AM to 4:15 AM on the 25th, several aircraft of unknown nationality were spotted over Los Angeles. Anti-aircraft guns fired 1,430 rounds to shoot at them. There were about 15 of these mysterious aircraft. Their flight speeds varied, with the fastest being 200 miles per hour. The flight altitude also ranged from 1,800 feet to 9,000 feet. They did not drop any bombs, and no aircraft were shot down. American army and navy aircraft did not take off to intercept them. The truth of this matter is still under investigation. Stimson continued that, judging from the fact that the enemy aircraft did not bomb, these aircraft were all commercial aircraft, piloted by enemy personnel. Their purpose was probably to intimidate the American people and thereby probe the positions of American anti-aircraft artillery units. Another intention of the enemy aircraft may be to force the American authorities to order a blackout along the west coast, thereby delaying America's war preparations. This information was first told to me by Army Chief of Staff General Marshall. We only have one thing to say about this matter, that is, we should be more vigilant in the future.

### Java and Sumatra in Chinese Records

The Dutch East Indies were no stranger to China in ancient times, especially the two large islands of Java and Sumatra. Pi Zong, recorded in the Geography section of the Former Han Dynasty Book, and Bian Dou and Du Kun, mentioned in the Lin You Tongdian as being seen in China from time to time, are believed by some to be present-day Sumatra. The Yediao Kingdom, which never sent envoys to pay tribute in the Book of the Later Han Dynasty, Emperor Shun's Annals, is also claimed by some to be present-day Java. However, the formal mention of these two places in Chinese records begins with Fa Xian's "A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms" and the Book of Song for the latter, and with the Tang Dynasty monk Yijing's "A Record of the Buddhist Religion as Practiced in India and the Malay Archipelago" and Jia Dan's "Record of the Four Reaches of Imperial Envoys" for the former (Jia's book has long been lost, but a rough outline can still be seen in the Geography section of the New Book of Tang). The New Book of Tang even has special biographies for the two places. It can be seen that even a thousand years ago, the islands of the Dutch East Indies had quite close relations with China.

However, the names Java and Sumatra have only existed since the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Before that, various other names were used. The Book of Song, Emperor Wen's Annals: "Shepo sent envoys to offer local products." This "Shepo" has been generally recognized as the later Java, a transliteration of the word Qavadvipa, which is the "Yavadvipa" mentioned in Fa Xian's "A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms." However, in the early Tang Dynasty, the name Holing was used instead. According to the "Biography of Holing" in the New Book of Tang: Holing is another name for Shepo, which is Java. It was not until the late Tang Dynasty that the name Shepo appeared again in historical books, and it continued to be used until the late Song Dynasty. During the Tang Dynasty, envoys from Holing and Shepo came to pay tribute continuously. Zhao Rukuo, in his "Description of the Various Foreign Nations," written during the Southern Song Dynasty, has a special section on the Japo Kingdom, with detailed descriptions. The records of Shepo in the History of Song are reprinted from that book. It was only in the "Description of the Barbarians of the Islands" written by Wang Dayuan in the Yuan Dynasty that the place was named Java. Qing Shi said that "he once sailed westward, what he encountered in the eastern and western oceans, he did not write unless he saw it himself." The name Java must have been heard by Wang himself when he was there from the locals. Later, in the histories of the Yuan and Ming dynasties, there were biographies of Java, which were once erroneously written as "Áà™Âìá."

There are very few records of Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, in old Chinese books, but Surabaya, an important military port today, was mentioned in "Description of the Various Foreign Nations," called Rongyalu. Ma Huan, who accompanied Zheng He on his voyages to the West during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, had a more detailed record of the area in the Java section of his book "Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores":

"...Traveling more than twenty li, we arrive at Sulumayi, called Surabaya in the local language. Fresh water flows out of its port. From here, large ships cannot enter. We travel by small boat for more than twenty li to reach the place. There is also a village head who manages more than a thousand local families. There are also Chinese among them.

There is an island in the port, with dense forests, where more than ten thousand long-tailed monkeys gather..." It can be seen that the place was still in a wild state at that time, and it cannot be compared with today's military fortress.

The evolution of the name Sumatra is more complex, and there are still some problems that scholars have not yet definitively determined. Generally speaking, the names Shilifoshi (or Shili Foshi), Foshi Lian Sanfoqi, and Jiugang in the old Chinese records all refer to the island of Sumatra. Jiugang being Palemang, that is, the Palembang seen in daily newspapers, is beyond doubt. As for Shilifoshi and Sanfoqi, they are probably both transliterations of Srivijaya, and some people claim that its location was in Jiugang. However, Shilifoshi, or Sanfoqi, was a large country in the Nanyang region in ancient times. At its peak, its territory extended to the entire island of Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula. It was destroyed by Java in the early Ming Dynasty. The territory has changed several times, so the records in the books are also too broad. Therefore, there are many questions about its location. In fact, what is being debated is only whether Shilifoshi and Jiugang are the same place. Shilifoshi is the name used in the Tang Dynasty for the area. The Book of Tang says that the country sent envoys to pay tribute several times between the Hamheng and Kaiyuan periods. Jia Dan's "Record of the Four Reaches" says: "...After another five days, we reach the Strait, which is a hundred li from north to south. On the north bank is the Luo Yue Kingdom, and on the south bank is the Foshi Kingdom." Luo Yue is the southern end of the Malay Peninsula, approximately in Johor. The Strait must be the Strait of Malacca. Then the location of Foshi is undoubtedly Sumatra or its east coast. By the Song Dynasty, the names Shilifoshi (or Foshi) were no longer seen in official documents and classics, and Sanfoqi was used instead. "Description of the Various Foreign Nations" and the History of Song both have biographies of Sanfoqi, and the Song Dynasty also frequently came to pay tribute. By the Yuan Dynasty, the name Sanfoqi was no longer seen. In the Yuan History and the Travels of Marco Polo, Maina or Malaieur were used to represent Sumatra. In the early Ming Dynasty, Ma Huan wrote "Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores," listing Java and Jiugang together. The section on Jiugang explained that it was the ancient Sanfoqi Kingdom. Regarding the Java Kingdom, it said that there were three classes of people: Muslims, Chinese, and locals. It also said that copper coins from past Chinese dynasties were in common use, which shows the deep relationship between China and the area. In addition, there was also the Sumatra Kingdom, which said that it was "the main route in the Western Ocean. From the Malacca Kingdom (that is, Malacca), southwest, the wind is good day and night. We arrive first at a coastal village, moor the ship, and travel more than ten li to the southeast to reach it," which is the Aceh in the northwest corner of the island of Sumatra, not the entire island. In addition, there was also the Aru Kingdom on the same island, located between Jiugang and Aceh. Aceh was an important port for navigation in the South China Sea at that time, and envoys often traveled between China.

In summary, it can be seen that for more than a thousand years since the 5th century, Java and Sumatra continued to come to China to pay tribute and trade, and the relationship was quite close. Especially in the early Ming Dynasty, Zheng He's voyages to the West frequently promoted China's prestige. However, after the Qing Dynasty strictly implemented the sea ban, this relationship suddenly became distant.

### Alexander Reviews British Naval Status, Says US Combined Power Can Win; Parliamentarians Continue to Attack Government

Stockholm, 27th, Huitong News Agency dispatch: British First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander, delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, reviewing the status of the British Navy in its third year, stating that the Atlantic war has now expanded into a worldwide ocean war. British and Allied shipping in the Pacific and Indian Oceans has also been subjected to a new crisis. The losses suffered by Britain last autumn were smaller than expected, but since Japan joined the war, the situation has suddenly deteriorated. The losses of the British and American navies in East Asia and the Pacific are indeed considerable. The Secretary of the Navy continued that since German and Japanese submarines have appeared off the American coast, we must do our best to deal with this and minimize losses. He answered a question from a certain Member of Parliament, saying that the torpedoes used by Japanese aircraft to sink the "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse" were light and heavy types, and that British warships would be equipped with special equipment in the future to deal with such heavy torpedoes.

London, 26th, Havas News Agency dispatch: First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander declared this month in the House of Commons, "The navies of the United Kingdom and the United States alone are sufficient to bring victory to democracies." Members of Parliament spoke in succession, launching a fierce attack on the British Navy. For example, retired Admiral Keyes directly attacked cabinet members, saying, "Prime Minister Churchill's policy of taking immediate and bold action is necessary if Britain is to win, but the lack of effectiveness of various subcommittees has destroyed this policy completely. It is regrettable that our navy cannot have strong air force protection." Conservative MP Downey directly attacked the Secretary of the Navy, saying, "It is difficult to understand why the Secretary of the Navy Alexander can be considered not responsible for the sinking of the Prince of Wales. Those who dispatched these two giant ships to the Far East without sufficient air force protection must answer."

### Numbers of British and American Ship Losses Published by Berlin's Official Figures Exceed 10 Million Tons

Berlin, 27th, Huitong News Agency dispatch: German official figures state that a recent British convoy lost another 52,000 tons. Cumulatively, since the start of the war, Britain and the United States have lost 15.5 million tons of merchant ships. At the beginning of the war, Britain's total merchant fleet was less than half of this number.

London, 26th, Havas News Agency dispatch: President of the British Shipping Federation, Runciman, recently gave a speech at the Federation's annual meeting, stating, "We must have millions of tons of merchant ships, otherwise all the preparations we make for war will be useless. Therefore, we must create new industries to meet this urgent need. In short, we must find ways to raise funds to replace all merchant ships that have been sunk in the past."

### America Acknowledges Difficulty in Reinforcing Pacific Theater

Washington, 26th (Havas) - Secretary of War Stimson stated today that the United States faces extreme difficulties in reinforcing the Southwest Pacific theater. The Blue Army's transportation must take a long and dangerous sea route, requiring each troop transport ship to be escorted by a destroyer squadron. Furthermore, the Allied nations also need to transport a large number of anti-aircraft guns to airfields in various theaters to strengthen defenses, which is also very difficult.

### Spring Eastern Front Battles Possess Decisive Factors - Soviet Minister Hopes Allies Act in Time - Litvinov Delivers Speech in America

Washington, 27th (Havas) - Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov recently told reporters, "Only by fighting on two fronts simultaneously can Hitler's army be defeated. Germany and Italy are about to launch a spring offensive and will make their greatest efforts. This is well known to Hitler himself. Therefore, we hope that all Allied nations can understand this as well. All my friends must act in time. If the large army stationed in Western Europe remains inactive when a decisive battle occurs on the Eastern Front, and only attempts to launch an offensive after the Eastern Front war is over, it will be too late. In recent months, we have repeatedly achieved victories, but we cannot underestimate the enemy's strength, because although the enemy's strength has been shaken, it has not collapsed. The German army can still fight and defend its positions, heroically defending every inch of land before retreating reluctantly. Moreover, the German General Staff has concentrated its forces to prepare for a spring offensive. You must know that the German-Soviet war is enough to determine the outcome of the current war. If we cannot obtain the assistance we need by next spring, Hitler will be able to consolidate his occupied territories, and our Allied nations will not be able to escape the doom of failure."

Balkan Countries Busily Prepare for War

Rome, 26th (Havas) - Political figures here recently stated that as spring approaches, Balkan countries are preparing for new military actions to resolve the German-Soviet war, becoming increasingly busy and important. Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu recently visited Hitler's headquarters and contacted the general staffs of various Axis countries, which shows the intensification of preparations for the spring offensive. Although the internal situation of the Axis forces and how they are distributed are currently unknown, there are many rumors circulating in the capital cities of the Balkan countries, and it can be believed that all countries are actively striving in political, military, agricultural, and economic aspects. Some governments have called on their people to reduce consumption as much as possible to ensure sufficient military food supplies without any shortage. All countries also believe that the most important issue at present is the Soviet issue. Competition and demands between countries can be put aside for the time being. According to German opinions, all issues in the Balkan Peninsula will be easily resolved at the future peace conference, but at this time, all countries should remain silent.

Turkey's Position is Pivotal

The capital of Turkey and Istanbul have now become centers of political activity. It is an undeniable fact that both warring parties want to win over Turkey and form an alliance with it. However, Turkey is part of the Soviet issue and the Eastern European issue, and how it will develop in the future still depends on the outcome of the German-Soviet war.

### Soviet-German War News

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to authoritative experts last night, after the Soviet army bombarded key points on the northern section of the Eastern Front with artillery on Tuesday, they immediately attacked the German positions. Because the German defenses were strong, the enemy suffered heavy losses of tanks, captured weapons, and military supplies. The Soviet army also suffered heavy losses in Fulu. There were no special battles in the Leningrad area on Wednesday.

Berlin, 27th (Havas) - According to military sources, the German army, covered by tank units, launched a counterattack against the Soviet Southern Army and entered the Soviet defense line east of Kharkov on the 25th of this month.

### French Ship D'Artagnan Departs Shanghai for Vietnam

The French mail ship D'Artagnan arrived in Shanghai at the end of November last year. Due to the impact of the Pacific War, it was stranded in this city for a long time. Due to the difficulty in purchasing fuel, the diesel engine was converted into a coal-burning boiler. The conversion has been completed. It was originally scheduled to return to Vietnam on the 18th of this month, but due to the Lunar New Year, it was postponed to the 20th. Unexpectedly, the registration procedures for the crew were not completed, so it was postponed again. It is now known that it has left the port on the previous Tuesday (i.e., the 24th) and sailed to Saigon and Hai Phong. The mail ship only carried more than 100 tons of cargo and a few passengers, only more than 40, all of whom were French and Vietnamese. Whether the ship will return to Shanghai after returning to Vietnam is still uncertain.

### Hong Kong Evacuees Continue to Arrive in Shanghai Today

After the fall of Hong Kong, the Japanese army actively reorganized the city. To avoid food panic, they implemented population evacuation. As for the destination of the evacuated people, it is hoped that they will go to Macau and the mainland. Those who return to Shanghai and various parts of China are not welcome. Therefore, the number of people evacuated from Hong Kong and arriving in Shanghai via Guangzhou is not large. It is estimated that a batch of about 250 people arrived in Shanghai on the Tsukuba Maru on the 9th of this month. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the second batch of about 200 people also arrived in port on the Takayama Maru the day before yesterday (the 24th). It is reported that the Anxing Maru will arrive in Shanghai from Guangdong today, also carrying evacuees from Hong Kong, but the number is less than the above two ships.

### General Xiafei's Ship Conscripted from the Philippines - French Mail Ship Xijiang Sunk by Bombing - Company Manager Kersey Arrives in Shanghai and Talks About It

The English "Great American Evening Post" reported that Kersey, the Far East Manager of the French Mail Ship Company, recently returned to Shanghai from Manila. According to a statement to a reporter from the French "Shanghai Daily News," when the Pacific War broke out on December 8, the company's mail ships Xijiang (16,000 tons) and General Xiafei were both in Manila and were requisitioned by the U.S. authorities. U.S. Navy guards were stationed on the ships, and all crew members, except those who volunteered for the D'Albertville faction, were detained. On December 10, the two ships were bombed while docked at the Manila anchorages. The Xijiang was hit and suffered minor damage. On December 24, the Xijiang had been moved to Manila Bay and was bombed again, being hit by six bombs, catching fire and sinking. Ten crew members were killed and eight injured. Captain Polet was also among the injured. At that time, the General Xiafei had sailed away from Manila, and no news has been received since.

Huabi Announces Retrieval Method

After Huabi Bank announced the retrieval method for vaults on the 20th, the items that are allowed to be retrieved and those that are not allowed to be retrieved are similar to those announced by HSBC. However, the opening date was not announced at that time. It was learned yesterday that it was opened on the 26th. The application opening time is stipulated to be from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. However, the vaults of this bank are actually equivalent to safekeeping vaults, and the items of the tenants are all deposited as safekeeping in nature, so there are no keys. Retrieval is only based on the receipt. The total number of tenants is only 200.

Retrieval Situation Not Crowded

After the opening the day before yesterday, the retrieval of tenants was not crowded. The number of people yesterday was even smaller. Only a dozen people went to retrieve their items with the receipts during the stipulated time. The retrieval application procedures are also simpler than other banks. There is no news about the opening of the Citibank vaults. The opening and retrieval methods for vaults of other banks such as HSBC, Maccagari, and Datong remain the same.

Citibank Branch to Close Tomorrow

It is also learned that the French Concession branch of the American Citibank in this city, located on Meyer Road, will close after business ends today, and all accounts will be transferred to the Citibank headquarters at 41 Jiujiang Road.

Yesterday morning, the store distributed 50 bags of rice from the Municipal Council. Ordinary civilians nearby rushed to buy rice.

### This Newspaper Establishes a Social Service Column - Upholding the Essence of Human Mutual Assistance to Achieve the Purpose of Serving Life

This newspaper has repeatedly received letters from all walks of life, either questioning public welfare or expressing righteous sympathy for relief work. After carefully reading each letter, it would be unconscionable not to publicize them, and difficult to ignore the friendship. Although we have selectively published them, we still feel that the effectiveness is not complete. Therefore, starting from today, we have established a "Social Service" column, hoping to provide readers' public questions to other readers for research and solutions. We deeply believe that the readers of this newspaper adhere to the purpose of life as service and the definition of human mutual assistance as a natural duty, and will be able to gather ideas and work together to seek public welfare.

### Impersonating Public Officials: Extortion and Fraud: Insatiable Greed Leads to Arrest

The leather suitcase factory founded by local resident Xu Liufa at No. 73, Lane 346, Tokyo Road, has recently been thriving, attracting the attention of criminals. At 9:00 PM the day before yesterday, Xu Kejian from Qingpu, local resident Ding Genbao, and Shaoxing natives Zhao Yongshu and Jiang Yongqing suddenly appeared, falsely claiming to be investigators from a special affairs agency. They claimed that the factory had stockpiled a large number of leather goods and copper fittings without registering them, violating the new regulations of the special affairs department, and threatened to report the matter to the director, who would have the items confiscated and the factory owner Xu Liufa punished. Ding Genbao even spoke in Japanese on the phone to intimidate them. Xu Liufa, being an honest man, was extremely frightened by their threats and pleaded for a way to avoid trouble. He asked how much money would be needed to make the matter disappear. The criminals demanded a minimum of 2,000 yuan in legal tender. As a result, Xu offered 580 yuan and requested a receipt, which they refused. They took the money and fled. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 AM the next morning, the group, driven by insatiable greed, returned to the factory and demanded the remaining 1,420 yuan from Xu. The case was reported, and Chinese Detective Sergeant Wang Chengying and Detective Tao Aifu of the Gordon Road Police Station apprehended them and took them to the police station to await investigation.

### Public Concession Deaths from Freezing Set Record: Report on Burial Work at Pushan Villa

At the beginning of the Lunar New Year, the spring cold was severe, with frequent rain and snow, leading to a daily increase in the number of impoverished people freezing to death. Enquiries at Pushan Villa reveal that the number of people who froze to death in the Public Concession collected and buried by the Villa in the week after the 20th of this month is unprecedented. In particular, the number of frozen corpses collected and buried on the 20th of this month alone reached 88 adults and 100 children, breaking all previous records. According to the Villa staff, the number of adult corpses being collected is increasing daily, while the number of children's corpses remains the same, which is a serious problem and truly reflects the hardship of life in Shanghai. The biggest difficulty for the Villa is the coffin supply problem. The current value of each thin coffin is around 20 yuan. Not only are expenses proving difficult to manage, but the future supply of wood is also a concern. The Villa originally had four large trucks, but now only one is in operation, which is only enough to transport corpses and materials to the cemetery for burial. Seven collapsing carts are used to collect corpses within the concession to alleviate the shortage.

### How to Return to Hometown?

My relative, Mr. Huang, who lives in Zhabei and works in the weaving industry, moved into the concession after the incident, renting a house on Mintiniyin Road for temporary shelter. His monthly expenses are barely covered. Because of the high living expenses in Shanghai, his income cannot cover his expenses, and his family of five is finding it difficult to survive. He intends to send his family back to their hometown. I respectfully ask the following questions for clarification:

1. What are the procedures for obtaining a return-to-hometown permit?

2. Can simple furniture be transported? What are the restrictions?

3. Mr. Huang himself has a job in Shanghai. After accompanying his family back to his hometown, he plans to return to Shanghai immediately. If he wants to travel back and forth later, will he need to obtain another permit?

Respectfully, Zhou Jifu

### Lane Hygiene

The lane where I live is very unsanitary because it leads directly to the main street, and people often "relieve themselves" inside, which is disgusting. Moreover, abandoned "infant corpses" are occasionally found. Are there any methods to prevent or remedy the above two issues? This concerns public health, and I ask for your advice without hesitation.

Respectfully, Li Fuyuan

### Public Debt Trading Concentrated in Type C

In the unofficial public debt market yesterday, sellers gained the upper hand. Although various firms made some repayments, such as Yuxing and Tongkang, which had considerable amounts of replenishment, Runde also had a significant appetite. Retail absorption was also not weak. However, Dazhong had a large volume of sales, and Shun Qin, Renchang, and Jiufeng also sold off considerable quantities. Buyers were relatively short-handed, and market prices fell uniformly. Type B even broke the 70-yuan barrier. The market prices of various debts have become distorted. Compared to Type C, the distance between Type A, B, D, and E has broken away from the long-term practice of the past. Only Type C is high, while the others are low, indicating that most buying and selling is now concentrated in Type C. The market prices of the other four types only follow the lead of Type C. Yesterday's market price results showed a uniform decline of four to seven corners, with a turnover of approximately 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Yesterday's foreign stock market continued to be flat and weak. Electric Power Bonds opened at 25,000 yuan, with a price of 64 yuan. 6,500 shares of industrial stocks were traded. Jardine Spinning Mill initially rose to 24.5 yuan, then fell slightly to 23.5 yuan. Sino 7 yuan, China Textile 9.78 yuan, Asia Navigation 7.5 yuan, Jardine Brewery 5.85 yuan and 5.8 yuan, Hengye 9.8 yuan, Paper Industry 6.1 yuan and 6 yuan, Tram 38 yuan, Rubber traded 300 shares at a price of 14.2 yuan. Other stocks such as Public Bus had a buying price of 9 yuan and a selling price of 9.8 yuan, Kaiping 30 yuan and 33 yuan, Yeguang 15.58 yuan, Telephone 22 and 23 yuan, and British Zha Hua 20 yuan and 22 yuan were all prices quoted for agency trading. Zilaihuo 11 yuan, Electric Power Preference 92.5 yuan, and British Da District 8 yuan all had buyers. British Union 20.05 yuan, Shanghai Silver Company 14 yuan, Xiangtai Lumber 25.75 yuan, Steel Industry 14.8 yuan, Wheelock Marden 55 yuan, Shanghai Woolen 6 yuan, Yangtze 11.5 yuan, Chen Shi 1.1 yuan, Langezhi 14.5 yuan, Li Pai 21 yuan, Di Bang 2 yuan all had sellers but no buyers. The rest had no price.

### Red Heart Turns to Prosperity

Yesterday, the cash red heart in the black market suddenly rose amid flat and weak sounds. The 13,000 yuan barrier has been approached three times recently, but it has not been easily broken. Moreover, the Japanese military notes are stable and firm, and the hearts of the people are turning to prosperity, leading one or two buyers to seek to push the price up amid sparse trading. From the morning, the initial opening price of each bar (ten taels) was low by 50 yuan, at 13,250 yuan. A certain gold shop and Yongfengyu came to sell, and a certain securities firm resumed business but sold less. The price continued to fall by 110 yuan, to 13,130 yuan. Yongfengyu suddenly came back to buy, and Cheng Ji and Mingfeng also came to buy. The market then rose by 240 yuan, to 13,370 yuan. Decheng and Xinfeng sold to 13,300 yuan. Until 11:20 AM, a certain bank forcefully entered, rising to over 13,400 yuan. Hengyu absorbed, and there were few sellers, once shouting to rise to 13,670 yuan. The final transaction price was 13,600 yuan, 300 yuan higher than the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 470 yuan on that day. The exchange price for gold jewelry in pawnshops was still listed at 1,400 yuan by Daxin and its counterparts (150 yuan less for buying in). Tael silver was 14 yuan, and the black market was a small half yuan, falling to 12 yuan. Buyers were still at 11.5 yuan. Silver dollars were 1 yuan, lower by 2 or 3 corners, at 7.23 yuan.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: British and American gold pounds each rose by 10 yuan, the former to 345 yuan and the latter to 355 yuan. American dollar bills rose slightly to 17.05 yuan. Hong Kong bills remained at 3 yuan, with large bills still reduced by one corner. Military notes initially traded at 4.18 yuan, then 4.27 yuan, and finally 4.23 yuan.

### Foreign Bank Check Clearing Procedures

Since December 8th of last year, due to the closure of HSBC, Citibank, and other British and American banks, foreign banks in the city have formulated alternative check clearing procedures, which are recorded below:

The foreign bank check clearinghouse is located within the Yokohama Specie Bank in Shanghai. The following banks and individuals may participate in check clearing: Bank of Korea, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsubishi Bank, Mitsui Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque de l'Indochine, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, Banca Italo-Cinese, Shanghai Bankers' Association Joint Reserve Committee, Xi Xingwu (for collecting payment notes from money shops on behalf of member banks). The Yokohama Specie Bank will send a clearing member to handle general matters within the clearinghouse. All participants in the clearing must open current accounts with the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the clearing difference will be credited or debited to those accounts.

### Japanese Yarn Prices Remain Firm and High

The cotton yarn market initially weakened but then rose, which was due to the good quality of Japanese yarn. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma factory singles was 2,150 yuan, rising to 2,160 yuan shortly afterward. However, as the table was filled with supplies, it loosened again to 2,135 yuan. But Japanese yarn prices continued to rise, and buyers were enthusiastic. The market gradually advanced to 2,200 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix 5,030 yuan to 5,050 yuan, 42-count Baoguang 4,910 yuan, 42-count Shuiyue 4,990 yuan, 40-count Jincheng 4,350 yuan, 60-count Nikko 9,780 yuan, 32-count Xiantao 4,100 yuan, 20-count Yueqin 2,720 yuan, 20-count Shuangma spot 2,490 yuan, 23-count Jinji 2,530 yuan, 20-count Tiannv 2,550 yuan, 20-count Fengnian 3,015 yuan, 16-count Hong Kuixing 2,190 yuan, 17-count Caiqiu 2,400 yuan, 14-count Jinta 2,160 yuan, 5-count Boy Scouts 1,700 yuan, 6-count Yanzhihu 2,000 yuan, 10-count Hongyun 1,600 yuan.

### Cease to Increase Cotton Cloth Prices Despite Ample Supply

Yesterday's factory cloth market opened flat but then rose steadily due to unabated buying interest. Although there was a large supply of goods from warehouses, the market trended upwards. Plain white and colored goods were the most scarce. White cat printed cloth traded at 93 yuan, up one yuan, then shouted to 94.5 yuan. Lun Chang's non-fading colored printed cloth was at 105 yuan, with a limited supply. Shilin blue cloth, Peach Blossom Friend brand, traded at 165 yuan, up one yuan. Three Sheep striped poplin was 4.4325 yuan, and 42-count plain poplin was around 4 yuan, all showing strength. White goods were relatively flat. Eight-pound Zhenzhong coarse cloth was 61.5 yuan to 62 yuan, sixteen-pound Feihong 103 yuan to 104 yuan, Huadie 124 yuan to 125 yuan, Fugui fine cloth 95 yuan to 96 yuan, Dapeng fine cloth 97.5 yuan to 98.5 yuan, and Earth fine cloth 101 yuan, an increase of 0.5 to 1 yuan compared to last month. Over 500 pieces were traded on the main street, with only scattered purchases from out-of-town customers.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to the good intentions and strong purchases of colleagues on this street, all cloths soared. The leading Longtou fine cloth factory singles rose even more sharply, opening at 110.05 yuan and rising in a straight line to a peak of 115.5 yuan. Subsequently, due to scattered sellers turning to profits, it returned to 114 yuan at the close, an increase of 3.75 yuan per bolt. Feiyu fine cloth was 108 yuan, Caiqiu 106.5 yuan, Yanghe 106.25 yuan, Trumpet 105 yuan, Wufu blue double fish 103.5 yuan, and Baobei fine diagonal 96 yuan. Wufu 98 yuan, all traded at the opening. Four Gentlemen: New tax new singles sold open at 3.74 yuan per yard, October to December singles 3.72 yuan, July to September 3.58 yuan, also soaring by 1.56 corners per yard.

### Woolen Fabrics Establish Joint Institute

The woolen fabric industry has been designated by the Asia Development Board to establish a joint woolen system institute headed by the Shanghai Mitsui Yangxing manager, who called a meeting. The Woolen Fabric Industry Guild, Camel Wool Merchants Guild, and Woolen Fabric Industry Guild each nominated four representative committee members. The woolen fabric industry is rumored to be holding a meeting in the next two days to elect representatives. It is rumored that from March 1st, the collection and delivery of woolen fabrics, regardless of warehouse or store inventory, will be limited to 20 yards. If the amount exceeds 20 yards, a transport permit must be submitted to the Joint Institute through the trade association beforehand. Otherwise, the goods will be confiscated and no responsibility will be taken. Therefore, store numbers and brokers who have not joined the trade association are greatly restricted in their business. It is expected that starting next month, there will be a large rush to request membership.

### Bean Prices Too High - Buyers Hesitate

Yesterday, the bean market trended towards stability. Buyers found prices too high and became less eager to purchase. However, sellers remained firm in their prices and held steady. As a result, except for red beans, which continued to rise by two or three yuan, the other beans remained mostly unchanged. Sales included 100 bags of Tianjin Quan Yuan beans at 175 yuan, 40 bags of Chongming Sha Huang beans at 145 yuan, 70 bags of Jiaozhou yellow beans at 175 yuan, 140 bags of Wuhu yellow beans at 147 yuan, over 100 bags of Tianjin green beans at prices ranging from 167 yuan to 162.5 yuan, over 1000 bags of Chongming Sha Can beans at prices ranging from 93 yuan to 93.5 yuan, 50 bags of Maojia City Qing Can beans at 96 yuan, 200 bags of Chongming Sha red beans at 140 yuan, and 130 bags of Yixing red beans at 130 yuan.

The source of red sorghum and raw peanuts remained scarce, continuing the market's strong performance. Yesterday, one cartload of Mingguang red sorghum was sold at 82 yuan, and 50 bags of Yangzhou raw peanuts were sold at 194 yuan.

Bean cake speculators continued to actively trade, resulting in robust transactions. This morning, with enthusiastic buying by investors, prices surged by another two to three yuan. Later, as those who profited sold off their holdings, prices leveled out. The final result was still a slight increase of 0.5 to 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Sales included 1000 pieces of Hankou bean cake at 30 yuan, one cartload of Wuxi Rong Kang bean cake at 31 yuan, 1000 pieces of Feng Ji bean cake February warehouse receipts at 40.07 yuan, one cartload of Fei Zi bean cake May warehouse receipts at 30 yuan, and 7000 pieces of Xing Ji bean cake May warehouse receipts at prices ranging from 39.5 to 37 yuan, June warehouse receipts at prices ranging from 39.5 to 38.5 yuan, July warehouse receipts at prices ranging from 40 to 38.5 yuan, and February warehouse receipts at 42 yuan.

### Rice Prices Continue to Soar

Yesterday, the supply of domestic rice continued to be blocked, and arrivals remained scarce. Sellers, still riding the momentum from the previous day, remained firm in their prices and aggressively pushed them higher. Consequently, with widespread inquiries in the early market, early rice opened at 275 yuan and thin rice at 174 yuan. Subsequently, prices continued to rise, reaching a peak of 277 yuan for early rice and 278 yuan for thin rice. However, at these levels, buyers found the prices prohibitive and hesitated, causing prices to fall back somewhat. The final result was a return to 275 yuan for early rice and 274 yuan for thin rice, still an increase of about five yuan compared to the previous market. Thick japonica rice, due to scarcity, saw exceptionally strong demand and low supply. Kunshan white japonica rice even opened at 293-294 yuan, approaching the 300 yuan mark, a sharp increase of seven to eight yuan. White Yuan rice, with only a limited amount available, continued to see rising prices, with Jintan rice opening at 285 yuan.

### Wheat Officially Trading

Wheat reserves have been depleted for a long time. Various factory outlets are now purchasing limited quantities at prices ranging from 110 to 120 yuan. Yesterday, the market officially opened with nearly 1000 bags trading at a price of 130 yuan, consisting of Kun, Su, Pu, Jian, and other local wheat varieties. Negotiations are underway for another 2000 bags, likely to be sold at the same price.

Bran ‚Äì Yesterday, some speculators sold off their holdings, but buyers remained eager to acquire them. Sanxin small bags reached 70 yuan, while large bags were priced at 69 yuan. Lanhua brand customer bran also rose to 68 yuan. Total transactions for the day amounted to around 2000 bags.

### Factory Supply Available, Cigarette Prices Plummet

Cigarette buying prices plummeted sharply yesterday, reportedly due to news that factories would be releasing supplies. This made the market extremely nervous, and sellers mostly adopted a wait-and-see approach. Products from Central Factories fell by 400 to 500 yuan per carton across all brands. Da Ying brand was trading at 7,100 yuan per carton, Lao Dao Pai at 6,400 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 6,000 yuan, Wu Hua brand at 4,200 yuan, Xiao Xian Nv brand at 4,200 yuan, and ten-pack Da Qian Men at 12,000 yuan. Japanese-brand cigarettes remained in strong demand because factory supplies were limited and sales were brisk, making price reductions difficult. Red Rose brand traded at 2,950 yuan, Jin Qiang brand at 1,720 yuan, Jin Da Lou at 1,950 yuan, and Quan Lv brand at 2,380 yuan. Domestic cigarettes also trended briskly. Da Mei Li brand opened at 4,400 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### A Student's Act of Chivalry

‚Äî Zhi Cang

News reports recently mentioned that the chairman of the Argentine review committee and a colonel engaged in a duel over a dispute, resulting in serious injuries to both. These two gentlemen, seeking inspiration from the past, drew their swords, presumably to discuss national affairs, each holding strong opinions. Unable to reach an agreement, they resorted to violence. While this may not align with the Doctrine of the Mean, it represents a straightforward expression of their personalities in resolving disputes. If they were truly selfless and willing to risk their lives for the public good, it would be commendable. Fortunately, the duel did not result in any loss of life, preventing a situation where "sacrificing for the nation would mean losing a valuable asset." Although separated by vast distances, the news of this event was considered highly amusing.

However, in this time and place, a comparable event occurred when a student, acting out of chivalry, intervened in a classmate's love affair. The result was the smashing of a car window with a brick. This is an even fresher and more interesting story, and such courage is even more noteworthy and deserving of recognition.

However, the latter differs from the former in terms of status. These individuals were students who, aside from dedicating themselves to their studies, had no other compelling reason to become enraged to the point of risking their lives. But what can be done? It was all for the sake of love.

A knight-errant is a hero, and providing assistance is unavoidable. The knight-errant's friends are naturally also heroic figures. For heroes, love is the most important mandatory course. If a "stubborn crab" is taken by someone else, it inevitably diminishes the hero's reputation. The heroes will then lose face, and they must do something to demonstrate their "true colors."

Thus, a piece of glass was smashed, valued at over 500 yuan. This is quite poetic, especially coming from students whose names are known and who do not change them. It adds a significant touch to their "academic pursuits," going beyond mere commendable words and deeds! I once read in a novel about two "child prodigy scholars" in Hunan who hated the county magistrate for rigging the exams, allowing those with no talent to rank high while their own talents were buried and they were unwilling to accept such injustice. They devised a plan to wait along the main road for the magistrate to pass by in his sedan chair, and then they threw stones at him. Unsurprisingly, they hit the mark, smashing the sedan chair's glass. In that feudal society, such an incident was considered a grave offense. Fortunately, the scholars' fathers and elder brothers held significant positions, and they only had to apologize to the magistrate, escaping a beating.

Centuries later, students are even more active and lively, engaging in activities beyond reading, writing, and conducting experiments. This may be due to the influence of the Dalton Plan, the Hua Xu Ming System, and similar educational approaches. However, some eager learners are taking the broader society as their laboratory, practicing and reviewing what they have learned. For example, after making an appointment with Huang Xiang, young men and women carry thick books and stroll along the shaded roads for extended periods, whispering sweet nothings, regardless of curfew. For example...and for example, "acting out of chivalry"...These activities are indeed broad-ranging, but they also seem to require some "leisure."

Fortunately, leisure is provided by their parents and has nothing to do with rice costing 260 yuan and coal costing 20 yuan. The act of chivalry is courageous and should be rewarded to encourage such behavior. This does not mean prosecuting them for "property damage" or awarding them a special first-class medal. The award should be: "Please, parents, exercise stricter supervision."

### Stage and Screen

‚Äî Tai Xu

Film companies will face production restrictions, significantly affecting the livelihoods of their employees. Their only recourse is to perform in spoken dramas. It is expected that many privately organized drama troupes will emerge soon.

Zhou Xuan accidentally injured her ankle on set.

The rent for the Lyceum Theatre is very high, and in the past, there was a policy against renting to Chinese performers. Presumably, Yao Ke's English proficiency is high, and the actor playing "Xiang Yu" is still a yellow-faced actor. Initially, the rent was 1,400 yuan for two shows, day and night, but it has recently been reduced to 800 yuan without heating.

Gu Menghe has moved from "Green Treasure" to "Dragon Gate" and recently to "Red Treasure."

The plan to have Huang He replace Tang Minghuang did not materialize, but Yang Guifei suddenly invited Xia Yun to make a cameo appearance, with the date of entering the palace set for February 5th.

The Shanghai Harmonica Society will hold a concert at the Tian Gong Theatre on March 1st, featuring various wind and string instruments in addition to harmonicas. The program includes "If I Were King," "Aiki Dance," "Romeo and Juliet," and "Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2," among other pieces.

### Sharing the Boat in Stormy Weather

‚Äî He Jia Zhi

(I) A Stormy Night

Guo Qi and Guo Fang were leaning against one side of the cabin, while Wei Cheng was leaning against the other side alone. Guo Fang suddenly reached out from the quilt and pointed at Wei Cheng, saying, "Mr. Ye, rainwater is leaking above your head, dripping down little by little. It seems like several drops have already fallen." Wei Cheng touched the back of his neck, and indeed, it was wet and felt cold. He looked up again and saw rainwater dripping down from a crack. Guo Qi handed him a handkerchief, saying, "Stuff the crack with the handkerchief, and it will be fine." Guo Fang said, "That might not work, Mr. Ye. You should sit over here." Wei Cheng first stuffed the leaking spot with the handkerchief and laughed, "Old rain meeting again, it's appropriate for rain to add some atmosphere. This person of mine is numbed by happiness, and I didn't even notice it dripping down my neck. Miss Chen will certainly laugh at me." Guo Fang still insisted that Wei Cheng should change his position. Guo Qi's experience with traveling by boat seemed to be richer than that of a friend and a younger sister. He said, "If two people lean against this side together, the boat will lose its balance. Wei Cheng, you sit over here, and we'll sit over there. Even if water leaks down, it will leak near Wei Cheng's feet, and that won't matter."

After they switched positions, Guo Qi smiled and said, "Come to think of it, Wei Cheng and I are only twenty li apart. Someday, if we're both in the mood and thinking of each other, and if we walk at our usual pace, it would take at most two hours for you to arrive at my home and for me to arrive at your home. But neither of us has ever done that. It's really strange." Guo Fang sat close to the rear cabin. Sometimes, the lamplight shone on everyone's faces. Other times, she had to turn her face away, and her brother Guo Qi's shadow would cover her face. She could turn her bright eyes in the darkness and look at people, but they couldn't see her. After hearing what Guo Qi said, she took out a bag of crackers from a paper bag beside her and placed it on the quilt. It goes without saying that the ones close to her were for Guo Qi, and the ones far away were for Wei Cheng. She said, "Eat! Everyone, eat!" Wei Cheng nodded and said, "I've already eaten dinner. Have you two siblings not eaten?" Guo Qi said, "Who hasn't eaten? Guo Fang came to my school, and I was just eating. Guo Fang ate with me at my school. Otherwise, she would have come here to eat. There's a small restaurant in the neighborhood. We are also their regular customers." Wei Cheng said, "Is the owner a fair and plump lady?" Guo Qi said, "That's the one. If my sister and I were to go to that restaurant to eat, we might meet right there in the restaurant, without having to wait until we got on the boat." (VIII)

### Establishing a Mutual Aid Fund for Students

‚Äî Ya Xi

I have a classmate whose family is extremely poor. His tuition for this semester was covered by a grant from this newspaper, but his living expenses are supposed to be delivered monthly from his hometown by someone traveling here. However, for some unknown reason, that money (about eighty yuan) has been delayed for a month. Since school dining fees must be paid in advance, he cannot eat without the money and has to eat out. He has had to borrow small amounts of money (three to five yuan) from classmates, which has led to rejection, cold stares, ridicule, contempt, and even some missed meals.

Another classmate relies on assistance for both tuition and living expenses. However, due to poverty and hardship, he has become ill. Initially, it was just a headache and fever, minor ailments, but because he had no money for medical treatment, his condition worsened day by day. Finally, a few of his closer classmates, acting out of human compassion, pooled their money to cover his medical expenses. Now, this student has recovered and is back in class.

Based on these two real-life examples, I am convinced that such situations are widespread. This is a serious problem, and how can we solve it? I suggest establishing a mutual aid fund for students.

Of course, running such a fund requires an organization. It is best if the scope is not too large, starting within a single grade. This should be entirely voluntary, initiated by the students themselves, managed by the students, funded by student donations, reviewed by the students, and ultimately benefiting the impoverished students among them.

In conclusion, I hope that this mutual aid fund can be launched quickly. In particular, I hope that the school authorities will provide all kinds of convenience and assistance, because you are in the business of education, and this endeavor is one of the most educational activities possible.

A Grain of Salt

### The Secret to Bumming Cigarettes

‚Äî Wu Han

Cigarette prices are soaring. A pack of twenty cigarettes in a tin box costs almost eight yuan. No, that kind of cigarette seems too aristocratic. Even ordinary paper cigarettes aren't cheap at a dime per cigarette.

Browsing through old magazines, I found a chapter on the secret to bumming cigarettes. I'll share it here for the amusement of readers. It would be ridiculous to suggest that you could use this method to enjoy endless free cigarettes.

Let's look at the question and answer session below.

Question: Now I understand, you're a master at bumming cigarettes, aren't you?

Answer: Yes, I never buy cigarettes.

Question: What method do you use? Do you just ask people for cigarettes?

Answer: No, that's too unrefined. I use psychological tricks to get them. For example, when I see someone take out a cigarette case, I say, "Oh, that reminds me, I'm out of cigarettes." Almost always, the person will say, "Please, have one of mine."

Question: What if they don't say that?

Answer: If the person is a bit stiff, then I use the "throwing a brick to get jade" method. When I see him about to light up, I take out my empty cigarette case, look inside, see that it's empty, and put on a surprised expression. Then, I shake the case, pinch my fingers, and mumble, "Huh, I thought I had one left. Oh, right, someone must have taken it earlier."

Question: If that doesn't work, what do you do?

Answer: Then, I quickly take out my lighter, light it, and offer it to him to light his cigarette, staring intently at the cigarette as if I want to smoke one.

Question: What if he's too stubborn and remains unmoved?

Answer: Then, I change my approach. I simply take out one of my own cigarettes and drop it on the floor.

Question: Do you really have a cigarette of your own?

Answer: Yes, but I only carry one cigarette, and I can use it multiple times without smoking it. I simply drop it on the floor and mumble, "I can't find it. My last cigarette is gone." Then, the person offers me one of his cigarettes. While he's not paying attention, I pick up the cigarette I dropped on the floor and save it for next time.

### Hollywood Wartime Film News

‚Äî Xin Ying

People are naturally curious about the situation in Hollywood after the outbreak of war between the US and Japan. Here, based on foreign reports, I will provide a few brief updates.

Filming work at Hollywood film companies continues as usual and has not been halted by the impact of the war. However, both the quality and quantity of productions have decreased, which is inevitable because the loss of overseas markets is an undeniable fact.

Even with the war underway, Americans are still going to movie theaters, so most theaters in major cities remain open. Some Americans even want to use movies to alleviate the terror of war.

The United States is now in a state of national mobilization, so some American male actors have been drafted into the military, but the number is not large enough to affect Hollywood's film industry. Moreover, foreign actors account for a significant number of people in Hollywood.

As for the male actors who have not been drafted, they are all practicing air raid and poison gas defense during their time off from filming, so that they can serve locally in case of an emergency. Many female actors are also practicing first aid, rescue, and other national defense work.
