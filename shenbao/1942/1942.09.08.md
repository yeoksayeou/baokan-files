### German Announcement of the Occupation of Novorossiysk Port; Soviet Union Powerfully Reinforces; Stalin Launches Counteroffensive on the Front Lines

German Führer's Headquarters, July 7th, Havas Agency Dispatch: The German High Command issued a special communiqué last night stating that Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast has fallen.

Berlin, July 6th, Havas Agency Dispatch: The official announcement has just been released, stating, "The Red Army guarding Novorossiysk city and its port on the Black Sea coast has been occupied by our forces. This significant achievement is the result of continuous hard fighting over the past few days by our Patton-Urdanburg, Franconia, and Hesse divisions, assisted by Romanian troops. The Red Army put up a desperate resistance around the city. Since the fall of Sevastopol, the port has been the only naval port available to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet."

Bear City, July 7th, Allied Press Dispatch: Powerful Soviet reinforcements have reportedly reached the Stalingrad front. The German command anticipates that the Red Army, having received reinforcements, will put up strong resistance. Currently, German forces have repelled the Red Army's counterattack under heavy artillery cover. The counterattack area is between the Volga and Don rivers. The newly added troops consist of ten machine gun divisions and seven tank brigades.

Stockholm, Sweden, July 27th, Havas Agency Dispatch: The German-Soviet war has reached its 64th week. At this time, what is noteworthy is the German occupation of the strategically important Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. However, the fall of this port is secondary in nature compared to the battle for Stalingrad, which is the key to the southern theater. Over the past 24 hours, the intensity of the fighting there has been unprecedented. The Germans admitted yesterday that the Soviets had transferred a large number of fresh troops from an unknown location and launched a counteroffensive last Saturday, the intensity of which was also unprecedented. The counteroffensive took place north of Stalingrad, with a force of approximately ten infantry divisions and seven tank brigades. The two armies fought fiercely throughout Saturday and Sunday. Although this counteroffensive is said to have been contained, the battlefield has become a hellish place, its shocking and horrific conditions not much different from the most terrifying battlefields of the previous European war. According to Soviet claims yesterday, the German offensive southwest of Stalingrad used more than 100 tanks, 40,000 infantry, 150 bombers, and numerous flat-trajectory guns, but achieved no results, nor did it ease their offensive. Moscow acknowledged that the situation remains very serious, and German officials also stated that their troops have not yet entered Stalingrad. Rumors that the defending forces planned to escape across the Volga River were also deemed inaccurate.

Berlin, July 7th, Havas Agency Dispatch: The fall of Novorossiysk has caused the Soviet Union to lose its last base for the Black Sea Fleet. As for the ports of Tuapse and Batumi, which are still in Soviet hands, the Soviet army cannot utilize them to dock large warships due to topographical reasons and incomplete facilities. Novorossiysk has a bay 15 kilometers deep and 11 kilometers wide, which is ice-free year-round and has approximately 4 kilometers of modern port facilities. The city has a population of 150,000 and is full of oil refineries and other industrial sites, making it economically quite important. This is not the first time German and allied forces have entered the city. Previously, in October 1918, the fleets of the four nations of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan sailed into the port. In 1920, after the failure of the anti-Bolshevik revolution, General 台金's White Russian army escaped from the port by boat. The port was built in 1838, and the administrative office of the North Caucasus is also located in the city.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Hengyang; Lingling and Baoqing Attacked Simultaneously

Japanese Air Force Base, July 7th, Allied Press Dispatch: At dawn yesterday morning, Japanese planes bombed the air force bases in Hengyang, Lingling, and Baoqing in Hunan Province a total of four times. The Japanese planes encountered no resistance, and more than half of the American planes were destroyed. Only one American plane was encountered over Hengyang, and it escaped into the clouds. When Japanese planes attacked Guilin and Lingling on July 3rd and 9th, the official announcement was that seven American planes were lost, but now it is confirmed to be ten. On the same day, an American plane was also shot down somewhere in Jiangxi Province.

### Bombay Citizens Demonstrate

Lisbon, July 7th, Allied Press Dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch from Bombay, citizens in Bombay City took to the streets again to demonstrate on the evening of the 6th. It started in thirteen locations simultaneously. Streetcars and buses were stopped due to being pelted with stones by the crowd. Police officers opened fire on the crowds and threw tear gas at the assembled masses at intersections. The riot lasted for two hours before the crowd dispersed. At that time, two people were injured and twenty were arrested.

Fighting Outside Stalingrad; German Offensive Thwarted

Moscow, July 7th, Allied Press Dispatch: The Soviet Information Bureau announced at midnight that fierce fighting continued on July 6th in the northwest, southwest, and Caucasus areas of Stalingrad.

Berlin, July 7th, Havas Agency Dispatch: A Havas Agency reporter learned last night from military officials that the Soviet army, fighting with all its reserves, managed to impede the German advance at several points in Stalingrad. Yesterday, in the suburbs of Stalingrad, the two sides engaged in close combat from morning to night, engaging in bayonet fighting with no resolution. The Soviet offensive north of Stalingrad was particularly fierce, with ten infantry divisions and seven tank brigades fighting desperately, their purpose being to prevent the advance of German tank columns southward along the Volga River. However, the Soviet army was subjected to German artillery and aircraft bombardment and ultimately failed. No fewer than 84 Soviet tanks were destroyed in this battle. The terrain was rugged and uneven in several places, preventing the Germans from advancing with heavy artillery, so infantry and engineers were dispatched as vanguards to clear out enemy resistance nests, thus failing to make rapid progress. Romanian troops fought bravely, breaking into enemy positions under heavy fire. At the same time, German aircraft repeatedly bombed the defensive works and the railway and highway north of Stalingrad.

### Colonel Iwasaki's Broadcast

Tokyo, July 7th, Allied Press Dispatch: This radio station broadcast this afternoon the broadcast speech of Colonel Iwasaki, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, entitled "Various Aspects of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Operation." The text of his speech is as follows: From June to July of this year, the rainfall in Central China was particularly high, and the Yangtze River was repeatedly in danger of breaching. The rivers north and south of the Yangtze River flooded repeatedly, turning flat land into swamps, causing heavy losses to people, livestock, and crops. From mid-July onwards, Central China experienced a heat wave unprecedented in decades. At that time, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi operation was underway, lasting four months. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Expeditionary Force has been vigorously launching offensive operations in China, Central China, and North China. From mid-May, an offensive operation was launched against the Third War Zone. The Third War Zone is rich in agricultural and mineral products, and geographically, it is close to Nanjing and Shanghai and is valued as a supply route for Chongqing. The Japanese army prepared in secret and suddenly began operations in mid-May from Hangzhou and Ningbo, launching fierce attacks in various places, inflicting blows on several divisions of the defending forces in the Jinhua and Lanxi areas, and continuing to advance in the rain, thus occupying the base areas of the Third War Zone. At the same time, the troops preparing near Nanchang, in order to coordinate the operation, echoed the battles in eastern Zhejiang and launched an offensive, traversing the flooded plains of Jiangxi, which had been turned into large lakes, inflicting blows on the Ninth War Zone. The two Japanese armies carried out the operation to connect the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The troops advancing westward from Shangrao and the troops advancing eastward from Dongxiang completed the connection operation at Hengfeng on July 1st. Recently, the two armies successfully carried out the Lishui and Wenzhou capture operations, the Songyang operation, and implemented operations near these locations, inflicting fatal blows on the defending forces and destroying various military facilities. What is particularly worth reporting is the thorough destruction of the air raid bases in Quzhou, Lishui, and other airfields, as well as the destruction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. This can be said to be the second objective of this operation. Chiang Kai-shek, given the large scale of the offensive operations implemented in various aspects, especially the eastern Zhejiang operation, believed that if the Japanese army advanced to a certain extent, it would retreat to the old positions and ordered Gu Zhutong to first defend Jinhua and Lanxi, and then to defend Quzhou to the death, but under the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, it collapsed, and then became completely at a loss, completely losing the courage to counterattack as in the Changsha operation. From this, it can also be seen that this operation, compared to the previous offensive operations, is unprecedented in its scale and duration. Also, this operation has had a profound impact on the residents of the war zone. However, it is impossible in operational terms to continue to secure the captured vast area. Therefore, after achieving the operational objectives, the withdrawal was started on August 19th in order to reorganize the front line. And this withdrawal is different from the past withdrawals to the original positions. It is necessary to reorganize a favorable and appropriate new posture in order to prevent the resurgence of the Third War Zone at any time. On this point, it has a new meaning. The soldiers of the Expeditionary Force continue to fight today, moving towards the completion of the operational objectives.

### Romania Vows Loyalty to the Axis; Policy Remains Unchanged; Never Forgets to Recover Lost Territory; How Much Was Gained from Participating in the Eastern Front?

Romanian Capital, July 6th, Havas Agency Dispatch: Prime Minister General Antonescu recently took the occasion of the first anniversary of his administration to issue a message to the nation, stating, "I thank God for allowing me to lead the Romanian army on the Eastern Front towards a beneficial path. Our army is now fighting shoulder to shoulder with Germany to settle our blood debts. This is the most terrifying war in history, concerning the survival of human civilization. We have made every effort, but due to various difficulties last winter, our efforts have not been fruitful. Given the situation, we must remain calm and frugal so that no one will suffer in the future and so that our army can continue to fulfill its duties."

Romanian Capital, July 6th, Havas Agency Dispatch: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mihail Antonescu Donescu recently delivered a speech here, clarifying the government's current policy, stating that the Romanian government is closely following the Axis policy and maintaining the most sincere relations with Switzerland, Turkey, France, Denmark, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Slovakia. Our foreign policy is a national consensus. The war we are engaged in is neither aggressive nor militaristic. As for the issue of Outer Transylvania (which has been annexed by Hungary), we have been the defenders of the lands at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains for two thousand years. This land is not only always ours, but also the birthplace of our arduous struggles. It is also the reason why our national vitality has been maintained for centuries.

The Issue of Ethnic Minorities in Outer Transylvania

Hungarian Capital, July 6th, Havas Agency Dispatch: The German-Italian Arbitration Committee established in Vienna in August 1940 between Hungary and Romania, after demarcating the military boundary line, began investigating the ethnic minority issues within the two countries. Recently, it conducted an investigation in Outer Transylvania two months ago and has now returned here. It is believed that the committee will meet tomorrow to discuss the complaints of the Hungarian and Romanian governments regarding the mistreatment of ethnic minorities in each country and to draft a plan for submission to the two governments for approval and implementation. The Hungarian government filed a complaint because Hungarian minorities in Southern Transylvania (still owned by Romania) were being conscripted. After investigating the truth, the German-Italian Arbitration Committee will use the results as the basis for drafting a solution.

Romanian Finance and Industry are Under German Control

Romanian Capital, July 6th, Havas Agency Dispatch: German Economics Minister Dr. Funk recently came here for economic talks with local authorities, thus bringing Romanian-German trade relations into a new stage. After the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles in 1918, Romanian-German trade was almost zero. Trade began to improve when the two sides signed a commercial treaty in 1935. In 1935, Romania's total exports to Germany were 67 million marks, increasing to 119 million marks in 1939. As for Germany's total exports to Romania, they were 80 million marks in 1935, increasing to 180 million marks in 1939. On the eve of the current war, Germany and Romania signed a new treaty, allowing Germany to begin actively intervening in Romanian finance, industry, and agriculture, and jointly establishing several companies. In 1940, Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu visited Berlin and reaffirmed this policy. At this point, German industrial operations occupied an important part of Romania's ten-year plan. The establishment of the German-Romanian joint steel production and sales company in the Romanian capital in early 1940 is one example. In the three years since the war, German-Romanian economic relations have continued to grow, mainly because oil has become the most important raw material in the war. It is believed that Dr. Funk's trip will further promote German-Romanian trade and increase the ties between the two countries.

Germany Encourages the People of the Occupied Territories

Tokyo, July 7th, Allied Press Dispatch: According to the "Asahi Shimbun," a special dispatch from Berlin stated that Rosenberg, the Administrative Officer of the German Occupied Territories in the East, published an article in the Nazi Party's newspaper "People's Observer" on the 6th, explaining the fundamental policy towards the occupied countries of Europe, which is worthy of attention. The general idea is that during this war, the German people are making the greatest sacrifices on the front lines for the construction of Europe, and those in the rear should endure all the inconveniences. Therefore, it is natural to demand that the countries of the occupied territories, which were once our enemy countries, make their greatest sacrifices. Some of them have forgotten the fact of defeat and sometimes still show antipathy towards Germany. However, in the current war, only Germany and its direct allies can demand priority. Germany is now removing the danger of Communism from all of Europe, so it has become the representative country of Europe. Its purpose is to prevent the people of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands from being conquered by Communism, so it does not want to seize their land. Today, in addition to continuing to work and maintain their survival, they should also work for Germany and its allies. During this period of the construction of the new Europe, they can only survive by cooperating with Germany. In the past, Führer Hitler has repeatedly shown a generous attitude, but it is regrettable that they have not fully understood this situation. The people of all countries in Europe should actively cooperate with Germany and its allies for their own destiny. Only in this way can the solution of European problems and the end of the war come sooner.

### South African Deputy Prime Minister Opposes Parliamentary Re-election

Cape Town, July 6th, Havas Agency Dispatch: South African Deputy Prime Minister Colonel Reitz gave a speech today explaining the South African political situation, stating that the South African Parliament was originally scheduled for re-election early next year, but during this time of war, if the election proceeds as usual, it will inevitably cause a small-scale political war throughout the country, which is not appropriate. Regardless of the outcome of the election, the government will never allow the pro-peace faction to rule the country. The opposition of the current government originally hoped that Germany would win. If they gain an advantage in the re-election by a small majority, what will be the situation in our country? It is unimaginable. Moreover, a large number of our country's soldiers are fighting overseas and cannot participate in the election, so the outcome of the election will inevitably fail to represent the true public opinion, so it is not necessary to do it again. A Reuters reporter recently commented on this speech, saying that the South African Federal Government officials oppose parliamentary re-election, and this public official should be the first to speak out. According to the Federal Constitution, Parliament should be re-elected at least once every five years. The last election was held in 1938.

### Repeated Outbreaks of Riots in Northern Ireland

London, June 6th, Havas News Agency - A telegram from Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, reports that the Irish Republican Army's revolutionary movement has been spreading rapidly, astonishing the stationed American troops. Investigations reveal that the Irish Nationalist Party has been plotting uprisings for several years, but their activities have only become prominent in recent weeks. Serious incidents are occurring daily throughout the region. The Republican Army has long advocated for the unification of the six counties of Northern Ireland to form an independent nation, with the indivisibility and unity of Northern and Southern Ireland as their revolutionary slogan. However, the expansion of this revolutionary group has resulted in its being deemed illegal even by people in the Republic of Southern Ireland. Furthermore, the Republican Army's current uprising is particularly perplexing, as it aims to oppose the stationing of British and American troops on Irish territory. Recently, a secret armory was discovered near Belfast, and the police authorities have been taking strict precautions.

Belfast, June 6th, Havas News Agency - Another shooting incident against the police occurred in Clutter, a town in Trelease County, Northern Ireland. A group of rioters opened fire on Northern Irish police officers, who returned fire. As a result, one police officer was killed and two civilians were injured.

### The French Concession Civilian Police Corps Has Begun Service: 70 Members Selected by Lottery from Each Lienpao Aged 25-35

Following the French Concession authorities' organization of the Civilian Police Corps based on the Pao-Chia system, the investigation of Chinese male residents aged 20 to 45 within the concession has been completed. All are required to participate in the Civilian Police Corps. Recently, each Lienpao has received an order from the Police Department to select 70 men aged 25 to 35, with literacy and robust physique as qualifications. However, since the number of men in each Lienpao within the aforementioned age range is bound to exceed the quota, a lottery method will be used for fairness. The selection will be made immediately, and the list must be submitted to each police station by 9:00 AM on the 17th. The following men are exempted from service: Public officials, Teachers, Licensed doctors, Pao-Chia officers. However, the patrol duty of the Civilian Police Corps of the Central District Police Station has already begun on a trial basis yesterday. It is stipulated that each Pao will take turns, from 8:00 AM to 12:00 midnight, with each shift lasting two hours.

Immediately raise an alarm if an incident occurs. Assist the police station in searching for illegal elements. Advise residents to abide by laws and police regulations. Provide the police station with information related to public security. Pay attention to suspicious individuals while patrolling.

### Crime Decreases in the French Concession in August: Only One Robbery Case

Crimes in the French Concession decreased significantly in August. Only one robbery case occurred (two in July, six in June, and 41 in the same period last year). The details are as follows:

Robbery Case

At 9:30 AM on August 11, two robbers (one armed) stopped in front of a watch shop at 452 Rue Puei Shih. The unarmed robber stood guard outside, while the armed robber entered the shop and asked to see three watches worth 650 yuan. After seizing them, he threatened the shop owner with a gun. However, the shop owner had already suspected that they were not good people and immediately snatched back the watches from the robber's hand and shouted loudly. The robbers immediately fled, but the armed robber was chased and captured by patrolling police officers not far from the scene. His accomplice escaped. This case has been handed over to the court and is currently under trial.

Murder

In addition, there was one attempted murder and two murders in August. The details are as follows: At 11:00 AM on August 16, a firefighter from the Jiang Jian Road Fire Brigade encountered two of his former lovers in front of 274 Rue Cardinal Mercier.

It was found that he robbed Ding Xinhe's home at 236 Rue Edouard on June 25, 1936, at 9:30 PM, stealing jewelry worth 11,400 yuan. All of the above cases are still under investigation and the suspects are temporarily detained pending further investigation and prosecution.

### Limited Price of Fresh Meat: Not Yet Directly Supplied

Since the Public Works Department limited the selling price of fresh meat to 8.6 yuan, meat merchants have complained that the market is not yet able to directly supply pigs, and some people are still monopolizing the market, so the black market has not disappeared. Therefore, although fresh meat is sold at the limited price, good meat and inferior meat are secretly mixed and sold together.

### Madam Huang Fang, Mother of Huang Weiqiao, Passes Away

The day before yesterday was the day when a memorial service was held in Shanghai for Madam Fang, the mother of Huang Weiqiao, a director of the Junhua Jushantang (Charitable Hall). People from all walks of life came to pay their respects. Huang Weiqiao is knowledgeable in literature, epigraphy, and classics, and has been dedicated to social causes. He is a generous and chivalrous person with an ancient spirit. Madam Fang observed vegetarianism, worshipped Buddha, strictly adhered to the five precepts, and recited the Diamond Sutra, Amitabha Sutra, and other Mahayana sutras every day. She diligently recited the holy name of Buddha for thirty years without interruption. On June 17, she suddenly felt unwell and knew that she would not recover. She instructed her family to economize on funeral expenses and use the money for charitable deeds. Her family invited Buddhist monks to recite the name of Buddha. She remained clear-minded and chanted along with them. The next day, at the hour of Wei (1-3 PM), she suddenly recited the name of Buddha aloud and passed away peacefully. She was 97 years old. Those who knew her said that she would definitely be reborn in the Western Pure Land. On that day, the chairman of Jushantang, Lan Ting, presided over the memorial service, and the vice-chairman, Zhu Xiechen, assisted. All the funeral donations were allocated to the hall's fund.

### U.S. President Lines Prepares to Hand Over Assets: To Be Taken Over by Osaka Shosen Kaisha

Since December 8 of last year, the Japanese side has been taking over British and American commercial properties separately. The British and American shipping agencies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire have already been taken over. Because Great Britain, Tianjin, and Changyu do not have real estate, there was no way to take them over. However, the American President Lines is the largest American shipping agency in China. It has its own wharf and engine room in Baiganding, and a nine-story building on Guangdong Road. It is a large-scale operation. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was sealed off and stopped operating. It has now been nine months. The company is now being taken over by Osaka Shosen Kaisha, which has been designated by the Japanese naval authorities. The company sent personnel yesterday to sort out the accounts, inspect the properties, and prepare for the handover. The Great Anti Company also sent Japanese personnel to the President Lines to supervise. The shipping policy of the company after being taken over by Osaka Shosen has not yet been announced.

### Authorities are Monitoring Food Store Prices
Various Items will have Fixed Values

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that officials are still carefully studying the price suppression measures that will be announced in the near future. The market in Shanghai is currently quite unregulated. Most stores are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the price reductions by major department stores and a small number of other stores, and have not followed suit. A large number of small food stores in Shanghai are being monitored by the authorities, and the authorities have issued special notices to inform them that they are being watched.

Authorities are Still Deeply Studying

An official stated this morning that another announcement regarding price suppression is likely to be made in the next few days. He indicated that the authorities are still studying this matter deeply and carefully. At the same time, he said that the authorities are currently looking for a temporary implementation method. The scope of the current study is quite broad, involving manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. He also revealed that a "constant solution" to fix and suppress prices will definitely be successfully manufactured and will replace the previous method of only controlling retailers.

Crowds at Company Stores Have Not Decreased

Yesterday morning, the crowds of people going to major department stores on Nanjing Road to buy cheap goods were still very large. The salespeople were very busy dealing with the unusually large number of customers. This crowding was similar to the business during Christmas. In front of the China National Products Company, a large number of citizens gathered at 8:00 AM. The organization of the lines of men and women on the sidewalks was maintained by the police. In view of the situation last week, police officers were stationed in front of major companies on Nanjing Road yesterday morning.

Money Dealers Agree to Cooperate with Fair Prices

It is learned that the authorities have obtained the cooperation of the money dealers, stipulating that all money dealers shall not use goods as collateral to make loans to stores or firms that have not been registered. If goods are used as collateral for loans, the following matters shall be reported daily to the local Money Dealers Association and weekly to the competent authorities for record: Name of the borrowing company or firm and the name of its representative. Amount of the loan. Term of the loan. Name and quantity of the collateralized goods. Location where the collateralized goods are stored. Registration number of the borrowing company or firm, or certification from its trade association. Money dealers agree not to make loans secured by goods to any individual or group outside of the trade association. Those who violate these three regulations will be fined by the authorities with a fine of more than 1,000 yuan. Anyone who hides the collateralized goods without reporting them will have their collateralized goods confiscated and may be fined more than 1,000 yuan and less than 1,000 yuan.

### Buddhist Lecture at Jing'an Temple

At 10:00 PM last night, several robbers broke into No. 29, Lane 119, Jing'an Temple Road. They took out cotton wool and stuffed the mouths of the housewife and children, and robbed them at will before fleeing in a panic. It is said that the losses were very large, but the exact amount is unknown. At the Buddhist Academic Weekly Lecture at Jing'an Temple, Layman Sun Xiangzhong lectured on the relationship between the Three-Ring Philosophy and various religions the day before yesterday. He explained the interconnectedness of the Three-Ring Philosophy with the Zen and Esoteric practices of Buddhism, the Confucian and Mencian spirit of Confucianism, and Kant's pure and practical rationality. The lecture was insightful and moved the audience.

### A Visit to the Shanghai Poor Children's Home

The Shanghai Poor Children's Home, which has a history of more than 30 years in Shanghai society, was established before the second year of the Republic (the first year of the Xuantong era of the late Qing Dynasty). The address of the home is at No. 504 Jumen Road in Nanshi. The home can accommodate hundreds of children, but unfortunately, part of the building has been damaged. Their founders were Mr. Sheng Xingsun and Mr. Shi Ziying, who were enthusiastic practitioners of social work in the past. The first director of the home was Mr. Shi Ziying. Their purpose was to take in poor children, provide them with appropriate education and care, and gradually teach them various levels of education and practical skills so that they could become productive and healthy citizens.

The day the reporter visited was precisely when they were testing new students, so I saw many boys and girls taking the entrance exams.

After the reporter filled out the visitor's slip, only a minute passed before a child led me to the visitor's room. At that time, there was already a spirited and kind-faced staff member waiting at the door.

After introducing ourselves, I learned that his name was He Jin, and he was a graduate of the Department of Education of a certain university. He has been working in the home for more than four years. I thought that a poor children's home that was willing to hire a specialist to serve as the director of education was enough to show their seriousness in doing things.

Now I will divide what he said and what I saw into the following five points.

Organization of the Home: The home is centered on the board of directors. The board of directors elects two directors to concurrently serve as the director and the director of administrative affairs, who are responsible for all affairs of the home. Therefore, the various problems of the home and the daily administrative affairs are almost directly managed by the board of directors, and all the disadvantages of barriers can be completely avoided. The current director is Mr. Zhao Jinqing, and the director of administrative affairs is Mr. Zhong Zhigang.

Admission Procedures: Any poor children who wish to enter the home, their families or relatives can directly obtain an admission request form and an investigation form from the general affairs office of the home. If they can fill it out at the time, it is best to return it at the time, or they can send it by mail. The home will send someone to investigate their family situation within a short period of time. If they are qualified and there is a vacancy, they can be admitted. If there is no vacancy, they must wait. However, the qualifications of the guarantor of the admitted students are very cautious due to the relationship of responsibility.

Advantages of Education and Care: Educating and caring for children, especially poor children, is the most important issue in modern social problems. After reviewing the home's facilities plan for the 31st year, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought that in the current difficult times, they were still unwilling to take things lightly. Their sense of responsibility is truly admirable. Speaking of their "education," they adopted the following methods: (A) Those who are naturally intelligent can receive education from elementary school to middle school, and from middle school to university. (B) Those who are of average intelligence focus on the combination of hands and brains in the fifth and sixth grades of elementary school and teach practical skills. (C) Those who are mentally challenged are only taught "Chinese" and "arithmetic," and at the same time, they are taught a craft, such as sewing and farming. Their method is based on adapting to each individual's intelligence, which can save time and energy and is also suitable for each individual's personality. As for the home's affiliated student vocational guidance center, any student in the home can seek help at any time. Such permanent care for the students hopes that they will not fall into depravity.

Teachers and Students Work Hard

When Mr. He and I visited the various facilities of the home, we saw more than a dozen little brothers, each holding a hoe and a sickle, some hoeing the ground, some cutting grass, lively and healthy. Who could tell that they were orphaned children? When I walked to their damaged building, I saw a staff member guiding more than a dozen little brothers to carry old bricks. With the teachers and students willing to work so hard, the future of the home's restoration is truly promising.

Economic Situation: According to Mr. He, before the incident, the home had 200 boarding students, 170 commuting students, and more than 30 teachers, staff, and technicians. The annual expenditure was more than 20,000 yuan. From the incident to now, they have been struggling to make ends meet. Mr. Zhao and Mr. Zhong have been working hard to take responsibility, which is truly admirable. However, with the recent rise in prices, although there are only more than 300 boarding and commuting students, the total expenditure has increased several times compared to the past. Therefore, the home has decided to publicly solicit donations from philanthropists from all walks of life. I think that such social undertakings are the responsibility of everyone, and I hope that those who are enthusiastic and benevolent will be willing to donate generously.

### Guohua Funeral Home Undertakes the Evacuation of Coffins from Eastern Zhejiang

Evacuating the coffins of the entire city is an arduous task, requiring a lot of manpower and resources. Precisely because of this reason, the transportation costs for coffins from the city to other places cannot be said to be excessive demands. However, not every family of coffins in the city has enough money to pay for the transportation costs. Moreover, these families may account for the majority of all families. In order to prevent the spread of epidemics and to evacuate all coffins, this situation obviously hinders the progress of the work. Therefore, the coffin transportation department of Guohua Funeral Home began to register poor families, adopting free or reduced-fee methods to help poor families evacuate coffins from Shanghai.

Registration Procedures

The coffin transportation department of Guohua Funeral Home is located in the east end of the Huian Building on Datta Road. The registration procedure for poor families is very simple. First, the applicant must have a written request, stating the number of family members and the economic situation, etc. Secondly, the applicant must find a guarantor to make a guarantee. Then, the third step is to wait for the department to send someone to investigate and verify the facts before approving a reduction or exemption of fees.

Prompt Investigation

According to the person in charge of the coffin transportation department, the people who register for poverty assistance are all laborers, so the procedures are kept as simple as possible so as not to waste their precious time. Secondly, because it is necessary to help prevent epidemics and evacuate all coffins from Shanghai as soon as possible, the investigation work is also as prompt as possible, and no delays or perfunctory actions are allowed. These are the two basic working concepts of the office for handling poverty registration.

Helping the Poor

"Free of charge—I never dreamed of it," said one worker. The occupations of the applicants are all kinds of things, such as apprentices, maids, switchboard operators, carpenters, newspaper vendors, police officers, rickshaw drivers, stocking knitters, street sweepers, daily necessities brokers, and even dock workers and people without fixed and suitable occupations. In short, all kinds of people from the laboring class on the Shanghai Bund are present. They aim to serve the society and help the poor, and achieving the purpose of serving the society from the spirit of helping the poor is worthy of praise alone. Moreover, the current environment in Shanghai needs this kind of organization to evacuate coffins.

Job Openings at the Vocational Guidance Center

The Vocational Guidance Center at No. 80 Hualong Road is recruiting various talents: One female family teacher to teach junior high school English, mathematics, and science for two hours a day. Experience in mathematics is required. Monthly salary is 80 yuan. One Japanese translator. Monthly salary is more than 200 yuan. There will be a year-end bonus. Three senior accounting and statistics specialists, male, with rich experience. Salary is negotiable. Several male document clerks, investigators, and salesmen with experience, honesty, and hardworking spirit. Salary is negotiable. Three female custodians with considerable experience. Salary is negotiable. All of the above must go to neighboring counties of Shanghai to serve. Two trainees, with junior high school graduation level, patient, honest, and hardworking. In addition to food and lodging, a monthly allowance of more than ten yuan will be provided. One chef specializing in dim sum, whether Cantonese or Yangzhou style, with proven experience. Salary is negotiable. One senior high school biology teacher with teaching experience. The residence should be near the mainland market. Salary is negotiable.

In the match, Qinglian advanced bravely and forcefully, ultimately defeating Huashun 7-0. In another match, the postal team fought against the rising team Samsung. The postal team has many strong players, but Samsung played hard and the scores were close. Due to lack of experience, they lost 2-5, and the postal team won.

### Funds Shift to Chinese Stocks

Department Stores are the Sole Target, Creating a Situation of Demand Exceeding Supply

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market saw funds shift towards Chinese stocks amid the disappearance of speculative voices. Department stores were particularly targeted, creating a situation of demand exceeding supply. China National Products and Sincere Company once hit the 100 yuan mark. Wing On reached a high of 98.5 yuan before some sellers emerged, causing a slight pullback. Compared to the end of last week, the former rose five yuan, and the latter increased by six yuan. China National Products Company followed suit, with underwear reaching a high of 32.5 yuan before settling at 31.5 yuan, also up by five jiao. In the public utilities sector, Chupei Water and Electricity also saw buying interest and reached 32.5 yuan, a strong increase, ultimately closing at 32 yuan, up 1.5 yuan, the largest increase. Chinese Electrical also rose by half a yuan. In the new pharmaceutical sector, New Asia was the most active, surging from 44 yuan to 45.75 yuan before pulling back by about one yuan, still up 7.5 jiao. Sino-French rose by half a yuan, while Minyi and others remained flat. In the cultural sector, Commercial Press rose to 270 yuan, and China Book Company each rose by five yuan. World Book was thinly traded and flat. Great China Match rose by 2.5 yuan, and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco was boosted by buyers by three yuan, reaching a high of 67.5 yuan. The new shares, Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving and Great China Weaving, saw little price change but showed underlying strength. Guanshengyuan has risen to the 200 yuan mark. Most people expect further increases. The stock price list for each market is recorded below.

Public Bonds Competition Intensifies

Yesterday, the unified public bond market fluctuated wildly, with fierce competition between buyers and sellers. At the opening in the morning, the buyers continued their strength from the weekend, pushing prices higher. Sellers also covered their positions, leading to an unusually strong market. All bonds rose again, each up about one yuan. However, as the closing approached, the competition between buyers and sellers intensified. Some large holders took profits, selling category C bonds. Although there was some upward pressure, it was ultimately overwhelmed by the influx of sellers, pushing the price down into the three-yuan range at the close. Although the trend suggests that the supply of bonds remains tight, large holders seem to be selling off some of their holdings, so the market may not rise further or may even reverse. As a result, unified bonds continued to rise by 7 jiao to one yuan, while category C bonds rose slightly by three jiao. The list is as follows:

### Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day

Grains Steady

Beans: Due to limited supply, local shops were eager to replenish, so the market was bullish. Yesterday, 40 bags of Tianjin tea beans opened at a price of 236 yuan.

Dried sweet potatoes are selling well, and the market remains promising. 60 bags of single-line Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes opened at a price of 117 yuan to 117.5 yuan.

Red sorghum supply and demand are relatively balanced, and prices remain unchanged. Yesterday, one truckload of Mingguang red sorghum opened at a price of 113 yuan.

Jewelry Gold

Mutually Imitating Price Increases

Yesterday, the jewelry industry's Daxin and other peers' jewelry gold market was exchanging at 2,100 yuan per tael (purchase price reduced by slightly less than 300 yuan). The peers' gold exchange price has already been raised. The initial low was five yuan less, at 1,871 yuan. A low price of 1,860 yuan was seen, followed by a rise to 1,900 yuan amid buying interest, which was then suppressed by limit-order sellers. At noon, it was 1,890 yuan, 15 yuan higher than last Saturday, with a difference of 40 yuan. Transaction volume was light. Jewelry silver remained at 10 yuan per tael. Peers were trading at 11 yuan and 11.2 yuan.

Military Notes Discount Rate Steady

Yesterday, the interbank rate for military notes was between 5.5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 4.8 li. Banks and money shops were buying in the market at 5.5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, and a half, and selling at 5.5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and one cattle.

The interest rate of the Money Industry Association remains unchanged at 1 jiao and 3 fen.

Cigarette Trading Quiet

The cigarette trend is rather stagnant. In addition, the authorities are strictly prohibiting hoarding, and peers are not allowed to sell to outsiders, so hoarding is quieter than in the past. Trading is quiet, and market prices fluctuate. Yesterday's market prices were: Great Central Brand opening small at 8,000 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 5,750 yuan, Pinhai Brand at 5,500 yuan, Fairy Brand at 4,400 yuan, Wuhua Brand at 4,500 yuan, Japanese Tobacco Golden Gun Brand at 2,280 yuan, Golden Building Brand at 2,400 yuan, Red Rose Brand at 1,600 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 2,350 yuan, Nianzhi at 2,300 yuan, Guide Brand at 1,950 yuan, National Tobacco Beauty Brand at 3,750 yuan, Golden Rat Brand at 2,700 yuan, Pyramid Brand at 4,400 yuan, White Gold Dragon at 3,200 yuan. Selling prices varied.

Cantonese Branches are Currently Negotiating Prices

Most of the second and third batches of Jinshan Yuanzhi, Bianzhi, and Nuomizhi that the companies have received have been transferred to warehouses. 40% of the market was negotiated yesterday. This valuation is very serious. Top and middle grades fluctuate by about 10 to 20 yuan. Especially higher grades are slightly increased. Yuanzhi and Bianzhi are about 25 yuan smaller than before, and Nuomizhi is about 15% lower. The official sales offer has not yet been determined.

Red Dates Sales are Tightening

Recently, Ningbo, Chongming, Guangdong, and other places have been procuring red dates, and the market has suddenly become active and trending tighter. Transactions between firms have also increased. Yesterday, the new market started with first-grade dates at 220 yuan. The king of dates and the head of dates will be increased accordingly. The market still has a tightening trend.

Black Iron Sheet is in Short Supply

36-inch Zizhi-brand black iron sheets have been exhausted on the market. The source of this product has been cut off, and Shanghai has limited inventory. Spot goods are bound to be in short supply. There are currently no goods available on the market. Even those who have spot goods are unwilling to sell because it is difficult to obtain a permit. The market has a "price but no goods" situation. Enamel factories, printing factories, and blank factories are also switching to making Touzi goods and black iron blanks, so the transactions of these secondary goods are frequent, and the shouting prices of peers are also rising due to scarcity. Yesterday, Touzi goods were selling for 1,200 yuan per market dan, and 2,000-pound black iron blanks were selling for 16,000 yuan. Therefore, those who opened prices were rare, and the result was also a "price but no goods" situation.

Whadda Woolen Fabric and Serge

Both Trends are Good

Thick and thin serge have been improving in recent days. Yuan-colored, dark green, grass green, and other thin plain serge and medium-thick serge are all trending well, and prices are quite firm because production has decreased, old inventory is limited, and demand exceeds supply. Peers, aware that retail price limits have been set and that it is impossible to replenish goods after they are sold, are generally unwilling to wholesale and sell, preferring to gradually serve retail customers.

Whadda woolen fabric, also woven from fine wool yarn, has become more and more popular in the market because raw materials are expensive and scarce, and inventory is also lacking. Each yard sells for 190 yuan to 220 yuan wholesale. Grass green is even more scarce because the dyeing pigments have long been out of stock, and the current trading is entirely for the limited inventory. Nanjing gangs and Japanese firms are searching for goods, making them even scarcer and the trend even better. If the price limits were not in place, price increases would have already begun.

Spring and Autumn

### The "Automatic" and "Passive" in Learning

— Yu Wan

I would like to comment on Mr. Kuang Cheng's article "Automatic Learning and Forced Studying." He explains that modern students' attitudes towards learning can be divided into "automatic" and "passive," which is indeed very accurate. However, why are there such distinctions? I think further research is needed.

Humans are living beings. They can grow, nourish, reproduce, and adapt. Furthermore, each person has a unique personality, which creates the driving force of their lives. From this point of view, it is a big mistake to explain human learning activities as having "automatic" and "passive" distinctions. When a student is unwilling to attend class in the classroom, they are not sitting still. They will draw heads, read novels, and do the work they like to do. What reason do we have to insist that they are lazy, unwilling to work hard, and must be forced to work?

Many parents are complaining about modern school education. They even say, "My child is preparing to become a doctor in the future, so why do they have to learn algebra and chemistry? As for labor and art, that's simply ridiculous." Of course, we cannot agree with these words, but in fact, they are also somewhat reasonable. We can understand this by analyzing modern education.

In ancient times, education was needed for individual adaptation and the transmission of the species. Later, two classes formed in society, a leisured class and a working class, and the business of education was occupied by the leisured class. When printing was invented, large quantities of books were printed, and education only required reading. Those who read well were intellectuals and members of the upper class. This was the case in the West, and it was the same in China. The ancients said, "All occupations are inferior, only studying is superior!" That was the highest stage of this kind of thinking. After the 16th century, the Industrial Revolution and democratic thought developed rapidly. Then we wanted to talk about universal education, vocational education, and civic education. However, modern education is still just for the leisured class and individuals.

In this era of widespread war, our lives are changing rapidly. The concept of a young master and young lady class has been broken, and it is impossible to live on inheritance and savings. Even if you have money and become a speculator, you must be able to read some economic news. There are also many students who need to find some work after class to maintain their lives. However, the lessons in school still teach people to write stereotyped essays and calculate the ages of fathers and sons. How can we expect students to learn automatically with such a curriculum? No wonder some people say, "You can eat without knowing how to read, but you can't eat without knowing people." In the past, reading gave you a qualification and made you an upper-class person. But now, this kind of decorative thing is very suspicious.

Professor Robinson of America said in his book "The Mind in the Making," "The failure of modern education is threefold: literary education, vocational education, and civic education." Because these things still teach people to read books, pursue knowledge, and create a few bookworms. Dewey's "Continuity Theory" advocates connecting wisdom, knowledge, and action. In other words, our learning is a purposeful activity. Knowledge is not a decoration, but a tool to achieve this purpose. Therefore, why should we talk about learning having "automatic" and "passive" distinctions?

### The Two-Price Theory of Banknotes

— Zhi Hu

It seems unthinkable that the "long queue" crisis would spread to department stores. Even though they are called "department stores," they only sell some clothing, shoes, shirts, and stockings. Wealthy families naturally do not lack "external possessions," and those with swollen feet have no time to care about so-called "appearances." Although the price of preserved eggs has been reduced by 4 jiao and 5 fen, some people are unwilling to eat "this kind of thing," and some would rather have "salt and tofu." Besides, squeezing in with a sweaty body only gets you "one item per purchase."

However, listening to the opinions of the buyers, there is a reason to believe them. They say that shopkeepers are willing to be fined and suspend business rather than lower prices. As a result, they lose in one area but gain in another. The wool comes from the sheep, so what's the difference? This time they are forced to "sacrifice painfully." Maybe the storm will pass and they will find another excuse to raise prices even higher than before. What can you do? Besides, since banknotes are worthless, selling some goods at home is a way to save up and prepare for hard times.

This is what wealthy people say, and of course it makes sense. Poor people, upon hearing that fresh meat prices have been capped, seem quite excited. But that day's dinner table is most likely to have a bowl of braised pork, ribs, or even shredded pork!

"Banknotes are worthless" is one saying. "Banknotes are not enough" is another.

### Our Lunch

— Shu Yan

Our company provides lunch, which is a rare benefit in this era of expensive rice and wages. However, my colleagues are not very grateful, and they think that this is a right that employees should enjoy. My friends all express envy. They say that eating out is very uneconomical at the moment. Even if you patronize small food stalls, three bowls of rice and a small plate of vegetarian dishes will cost at least three yuan. In this way, our colleagues are effectively getting an extra hundred yuan or so in salary each month.

For several years, we have always had some funny situations during our lunch. For example, every noon, everyone feels hungry, stops working, and constantly glares at the cuckoo clock hanging on the wall. Sometimes, when they can't wait any longer, they ask the tea boy to urge the cook to serve the food. Finally, when the bell rings, they rush out like hungry ghosts. Little Lu, nicknamed "Long Legs," is the first to reach the dining hall, stretching his neck to see how many good dishes there are on the table. Soon, everyone is seated, picking up bowls and chopsticks, grabbing rice bowls, and wolfing down the dishes and rice.

Recently, I only heard the cook complaining that he is paid 1,400 yuan a month to prepare two tables of food each day. Half of the money is used to buy rice, and the other half is used for coal, oil, salt, and side dishes. It is never enough, and there is no way to make a profit.

So the cook had to make more plans. The two vegetarian and one meat dishes each day were served in bowls, and three chopsticks could reach the bottom. There were only three buckets of rice each day, and there were no refills after they were eaten. As for that bowl of shredded pork soup, it was better to drink a few mouthfuls of plain water.

Our colleagues all have big appetites. Little Wang and Little Li eat four bowls of rice each meal. Now the cook only provides three buckets of rice per meal, so on average each person can only eat two and a half bowls. The first two days, Little Wang ate two bowls and heard that the rice bucket was empty. He was really furious. Later, the two of them implemented the "fast" method. They wished their mouths could turn into a hole and pour the rice in, wouldn't that be easier? Others had just eaten one bowl, and they had already eaten two. Others had eaten two bowls, and they had already eaten four. Then they felt satisfied, put down their bowls and chopsticks, and left. Only Lao He, Lao Xu, and Lao Lin, who ate the slowest, had their rice snatched away, and each only got a bowl and a half.

As for eating the dishes, Lao Xu was the most ignorant. Every time he used his chopsticks, he would scoop away one-third of the dish. Everyone at the table was unhappy with him. One day, everyone united to deal with him. Before he could even pick up his chopsticks, everyone took a chopstickful and emptied the bowl of meat dish. Lao Xu had to pick up a chopstickful of vegetarian dish, but everyone coincidentally came back with another chopstickful, and the bowl of vegetarian dish was also gone. Lao Xu understood in his heart, and the next day, he didn't eat any dishes and swallowed two bowls of plain rice.

Now I hear that the company is going to cancel lunch and give each person a subsidy of fifty yuan. All my colleagues are complaining. Even though it's a meager lunch, if they have to pay for it themselves, what can they eat with fifty yuan? This is probably affected by price caps!

### Suffering

— Lin Shansheng

"Suffering" is the boundary that makes humans human. It is an eternal law. The mother must "suffer" so that her son can be born. "Life" comes from death...

No country has not been tempered by suffering. We cannot eliminate this condition—the law of suffering. It is an unavoidable condition of our survival.

Progress is to be measured by the amount of "pain" experienced. The greater the wound of pain, the greater the progress. - Gandhi - (Qu Choux)

### Sharing the Same Boat in Wind and Rain

(8) What to Do

These rooms were originally Wei Yunqing's grain warehouse. This is the easternmost room. One-third of the space is still piled with sieves, and there are two temporary cots. In front of the cot is a table, and on the table is a bowl of steaming red bean soup. The tear stains on Xia Cuizhen's face are still faintly visible. She stood in front of the table and forced a smile. Wei Yunqing greeted her early and said, "Miss Xia, I'm sorry to trouble you. I'm so sorry. Aunt Cao, why don't you bring a stool for Miss Xia to sit on?" Cuizhen bowed and said, "I dare not sit in front of Elder Wei." Wei Yunqing said, "What are you talking about? Aunt Cao..." Aunt Cao hurriedly dragged two stools from under the table, wiping the stool surfaces haphazardly with her skirt. One was delivered to Cuizhen and the other to Wei Yunqing. Wei Yunqing first sat next to the table and said, "Sit, sit, sit." Cuizhen also sat down.

Wei Yunqing laughed and said, "Miss Bian, we used to meet often. Since you went to Shidetang, we haven't seen each other much. Your uncle, Fei Changhe, invited you here. I said earlier that the method of invitation was wrong, which made Miss Bian startled. Ah! What is this red mark on your hand? Was it tied by a rope like this? Poor thing! But then again, you can't completely blame Fei Changhe. Miss Bian must have been stubborn, otherwise there would be no need for a rope. Hahaha." Cuizhen said, "Let's not talk about the past. Now I only ask Elder Wei to send me back to Shidetang. The Second Madam and the eldest young master of Shidetang treat me like a guest. They don't know that I've come here. I'm afraid that they don't know. If they knew that I was in Elder Wei's mansion, it wouldn't be a big deal. They are very relieved." Wei Yunqing waved his hand and laughed, "They know. Second Madam Ye has already been here and quarreled with me. Miss Bian, let me tell you frankly, don't make a fuss about going back. I know very well that you have no home. Later, you treated the Fei family as your home, and then you treated the Ye family as your home. Now you should treat the Wei family as your home." (175)
