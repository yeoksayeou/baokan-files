### Fierce Battle Continues in Kerch and Kharkov Regions, Both Sides Seeking Superior Positions for Future Offensives

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th – Havas News Agency: For the past three days, the most intense fighting on the Eastern Front has been in the Kerch Peninsula and Kharkov regions. A major battle is ongoing, with both sides clearly seeking to seize advantageous positions for future offensives. Regarding the Kerch Peninsula, the Red Army was routed by German forces between the 8th and 15th of this month. However, since the fall of Kerch city, they have rebuilt their defenses and are currently putting up fierce resistance in the coastal area of Yenikale. The situation there yesterday was unclear, but judging from German announcements of air raids on Yenikale port, it is evident that the port remains in Red Army hands. Although Red Army reinforcements landed behind German lines yesterday and continued to resist, they face extreme difficulties under the pressure of German "lightning divisions" (armored divisions) and artillery. In Kerch city itself, all buildings have been fortified, with some accessible only with bayonets and hand grenades. The entire city is heavily mined, with mines placed in the most unexpected locations, controlled remotely by electrical current, maximizing destructive potential. The intensity of the fighting in the Kharkov region has only increased. The Red Army claims to have captured a certain stronghold and is advancing towards Kharkov city. The exact location of the front lines is difficult to ascertain. However, the Red Army's "Red Star" newspaper reports that "the sounds of artillery fire can be heard in Kharkov city, as well as in Krasnograd." Krasnograd is a vital railway center located sixty miles southwest of Kharkov. If this is accurate, then the southern Red Army, under General Mosienko, has indeed advanced twenty to sixty kilometers.

London, 19th – Reuters: According to the Soviet midnight war bulletin, Soviet troops launched offensives throughout the day yesterday in the vicinity of Kharkov city, making further progress. On the Kerch Peninsula, fighting continues around Kerch city. Moscow Radio announced last night that in a major tank battle near Kharkov yesterday, German forces attacked with ninety tanks. The Soviet side responded with anti-tank guns, concentrating their fire and destroying forty-six German tanks, with the remainder retreating. Since last Sunday, a total of sixty German tanks have been destroyed in this sector. It has now become clear that the southern Soviet army's initial offensive towards Kharkov resulted in the capture of three hills – one called Lake Hill, one Gold Hill, and one unnamed. Their strategic importance is now evident: the Red Army can now observe the main road and a key town nearby from these hills. The road runs west towards the German rear, serving as a springboard for attacking German bunkers and trench lines. The German forces made a desperate effort to hold these three hills but were ultimately defeated by the Red Army in one fell swoop. Subsequent German counterattacks have all failed. In the past five days, the Red Army has advanced between twelve and twenty-seven miles along a front of fifty miles. As for the Kerch front, the fighting has not yet ended. Although Kerch city has fallen, the old Turkish fortress of Yenikale, northeast of the port, remains in Red hands.

### German War Bulletin

German Supreme Headquarters, 19th – Havas News Agency: Today's German war bulletin states that the remaining enemy forces on the Kerch Peninsula are in dire straits and will be annihilated. Large enemy forces attacking in the Kharkov region have been repelled. Over eighty enemy tanks were destroyed yesterday. An additional twenty-one tanks and over five hundred other vehicles were heavily damaged by German aircraft and rendered inoperable. Since the start of this operation, 447 enemy tanks have been destroyed. German forces on the central and northern sectors continue to advance successfully. One Soviet unit in the central sector has been annihilated. German forces are making progress in intense fighting in the forests of Lapland. Enemy counterattacks have been repelled.

### Soviet Forces on Kerch Fail to Break Out

Berlin, 19th – Havas News Agency: The German High Command announced yesterday that the Soviet forces trapped on the tip of the Kerch Peninsula attempted to break out on Sunday, but were repelled by German and Romanian forces. Intense fighting ensued as German and Romanian forces shelled Soviet positions. The Soviets repeatedly attempted to land troops behind German lines using gunboats, but failed. Although the Soviet forces trapped in the ancient fortress area are putting up fierce resistance, they cannot escape annihilation by the German forces. In one location alone, 950 Soviet soldiers were killed and 1,100 were captured, demonstrating the intensity of the fighting. German aircraft also participated in the operation to suppress Soviet resistance. German aircraft shot down fifteen Soviet aircraft over the Temryuk Peninsula, while the Germans lost only one aircraft that failed to return to base. The threat posed by Soviet forces on the northern sector of the Eastern Front has been defeated and severely crippled. German anti-tank gun crews achieved a significant victory. German fighter aircraft engaged Soviet aircraft in aerial combat over the Arctic Ocean, shooting down thirteen Soviet aircraft. German aircraft also bombed Soviet positions west of Murmansk and on the Rybachy Peninsula.

Berlin, 19th – Havas News Agency: Military experts added to yesterday's German war bulletin, stating that the German forces on the Kerch Peninsula have achieved astonishing results. The Germans have not only broken through enemy lines but have also encircled and annihilated enemy forces. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet attempted to cover the Soviet withdrawal by sea, but to no avail. Multiple transport ships were sunk or damaged by German forces. Several Soviet offensives in the Kharkov region have failed. German counterattacks have been quite successful. Fighting in the region is still ongoing and is expected to be resolved within days. At that time, it will be clear who the victory belongs to. German aircraft have shot down fifty enemy aircraft and destroyed fifty-six tanks on the Eastern Front.

Berlin, 19th – Havas News Agency: The German High Command announced yesterday that German aircraft heavily damaged five enemy large transport ships off Murmansk on Sunday. Two of these are believed to have been completely destroyed. Fierce aerial combat has been occurring throughout the Eastern Front. To date, German fighter aircraft have shot down fifty enemy aircraft, and destroyed ten enemy aircraft on the ground. German aircraft are also constantly bombing enemy rear lines of communication. Besides multiple sections of damaged track, several trains loaded with gasoline caught fire after being hit, and many troop transport trucks were also destroyed.

### Mount Mauna Loa Erupts! Lava Flows Two Miles a Day, Unseen in 61 Years

### The Only Peaceful City in the World: A Lisbon Anecdote (1) The Exchange Center for International Diplomats

The international stage is truly an incredibly complex mechanism: containing nationalistic elements, it often infiltrates the heart and nervous system of enemy countries, acting like a bacterium and carrying out many activities detrimental to the enemy. Many of these are latent, like leprosy bacilli, not appearing on the surface of the skin, almost like ghosts and spirits, making people unaware that they are engaged in life-threatening activities; that is the trick of spies. As for diplomats, they are supposed to be open and honorable representatives or communicators of their countries, but in the institutions of some countries, behind this facade of openness and honor, many "bacteria" are hidden; therefore, such diplomatic institutions have become the headquarters of these bacteria.

However, once countries officially declare war on each other, the chaotic institutions created by these bacteria must be clarified, at least to a considerable extent. Imagine that once the diplomatic personnel are withdrawn, the headquarters of the bacteria will disintegrate. If they don't disintegrate but are instead confined, how can these bacteria continue to act?

Some may say that the above remarks are biased. The exchange of diplomatic personnel is a clause stipulated by the laws of war in international law, a necessary act of gentlemanly conduct on the international stage, and has nothing to do with espionage, etc.?

This is a valid point. However, what was said above only refers to certain countries and cannot be regarded as a general rule. Nevertheless, after taking this action, it can also be regarded as a procedure for clarification or disinfection, can't it? If you don't believe it, please take a bird's-eye view of the situation in Lisbon, this exchange center for international diplomats, and perhaps things will become much clearer.

According to regulations, the procedures for exchanging diplomatic personnel should be completed before the declaration of war. In these procedures, the words "withdrawal" or "recall" should be used correctly in writing. However, the current World War is completely unconventional: where is there time to issue an ultimatum, and where is it possible to handle the withdrawal procedures leisurely?

Therefore, the European war has been going on for almost three years (counting from the declaration of war by Britain and France against Germany), and the first batch of corpses on the battlefield have already turned into elementary particles, and the "tomb trees have arched" over the second, third, fourth… batches before they gradually thought about the issue of exchanging diplomatic personnel, etc. According to recent telegrams, the diplomats of the Axis powers and the United Nations will be exchanged in Lisbon soon. Now, let's talk about Lisbon, this strange area where the exchange procedures are carried out, and then look at some old examples of exchanges and international law.

We say that Lisbon is a strange area because of an incredible phenomenon that has existed there since the beginning of the current war. In the previous European war, Geneva, Switzerland, and one or two small towns also had this incredible phenomenon, but this time it is Lisbon's turn. As for why it is not Geneva but Lisbon this time, we can answer simply: Geneva has become like a middle-aged woman past her prime, losing the concentration of international communication between the belligerent countries, especially due to the unsatisfactory defeat of France and the early and eager entry of the United States into the war. Under these circumstances, Lisbon transformed from a country girl into an international social butterfly.

If we are willing to travel to Europe, despite the hardship, we can see some strange things in the embrace of this social butterfly. First of all, upon arriving at the port of Lisbon, you can see the postal ships of the belligerent countries lined up there, shoulder to shoulder, just like Hong Kong or Shanghai in the past, with no trace of war at all.

### Public Utilities in the Public Concession Announce Revised Prices, to be Implemented Uniformly Starting Today

The Shanghai Power Company, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, and the Shanghai Gas Company in the Public Concession plan to jointly increase service fees. This has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department and will be implemented starting today (the 20th). The revised prices and charging methods of each company were jointly announced yesterday. The details are extracted as follows:

The three major public utility companies in the Public Concession have strived to maintain the original prices in the past few months, so as not to increase the burden on users. According to the announcement issued by each company yesterday, the reasons for the price increase are explained, stating that the current service fees of each company are extremely low, while prices have risen endlessly, and the purchasing power of banknotes has also declined, resulting in huge losses for each company. If this continues, it will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, after careful consideration, it has been decided to increase the charging standards.

The standard for this price increase is: electricity fees will increase to 200% of the original price, gas fees will increase to 350% of the original price, and water fees will increase by 30%. At the same time, all fees will be calculated or paid in Reserve Certificates. As for the time range of this price increase, it is stipulated that all consumption periods ending on or after May 20th will be charged at the new price. For example, the May electricity or gas bills ending at the end of this month must be calculated at the new price.

The new prices and charging methods formulated by each company are recorded below: (A) The original price of water fees has not changed, only that all subsequent fees will be paid in Reserve Certificates. (B) Gas Company's charging method: (1) Gas fees: The price of gas is 30 cents (Reserve Certificates) per 10 cubic feet. The minimum fee is temporarily abolished. The penalty for exceeding the consumption limit, the current restriction rules remain in effect. (2) Gas meter rental fees have also increased, the prices are not listed. (3) Payment of fees: Accounts after the 20th will be calculated in Reserve Certificates and will only be allowed to be paid in Reserve Certificates.

(C) Shanghai Power Company and Shanghai West Power Company's charging method: (1) Electricity for lighting, heating, and general power: Basic fee: Residential or commercial lighting fee is one yuan per degree. Residential or commercial heating fee is 35 cents per degree. General power fee is 15 cents per degree. Direct current for elevators is 60 cents per degree. Electricity for street lights will be determined separately. Fuel adjustment fee: will be determined according to the monthly fuel cost. (2) Large-scale power supply: Medium-sized industrial electricity with a maximum capacity exceeding 100 kW must pay a main fee of 7.5 yuan per kW per month and a consumption fee of 10 cents per degree. Large-scale industrial electricity with a maximum capacity exceeding 200 kW must pay a main fee of 7.5 yuan per kW per month and a consumption fee of 5 cents per degree. Electricity for commercial use, with a maximum capacity of 100 kW or more, must pay a main fee of 15 yuan per month and a consumption fee of 10 cents per degree. (3) The minimum electricity rate is abolished. (4) The penalty method for exceeding the consumption limit will continue to be effective according to the current restriction rules.

### Chairman of the Board of the Public Works Department Holds a Grand Banquet

### Silver and Banking Industries Negotiate a Solution to the Panic Caused by Small Denomination Notes, Previously Collected Damaged Notes Sorted Out and Released into Circulation, New Notes Issued to Limit Hoarding for Profit

In order to remedy the panic caused by the shortage of one-yuan small denomination notes in the market, the Federation of Silver and Banking Industries has recently negotiated a solution and notified member firms to implement it separately: The issuing bank will increase the issuance of new one-yuan notes. Each firm will accept and disburse small denomination notes. If they are one-yuan Central Reserve Bank notes, they will all be converted at a rate of 1.3 yuan in legal tender for 1 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The Bank Joint Reserve will sort out and release into the market one-yuan notes that are still intact from the damaged notes previously collected. Each firm will issue and circulate as much of its inventory of one-yuan notes as possible. Measures will be taken to crack down on hoarding small denomination notes for profit and strictly prohibit the buying and selling of small denomination notes at a premium. After the implementation of the above measures, the panic caused by the shortage of small denomination notes in the market has gradually disappeared. In the past, all rice stores selling rice at government-subsidized prices had to purchase rice with small denomination notes, resulting in a very high demand for them. In the future, the new method of selling rice at government-subsidized prices will be 5 yuan for every 1.5 liters, without the need to buy rice with small denomination notes. The circulation of small denomination notes in the market should gradually increase.

### Those Buying Rice from the Bureau Must Return the Sacks, The Public Works Department Forbids the Transfer of Sacks

The Public Works Department announces: It is hereby announced that from May 20th of this year, all empty sacks (including coarse hemp sacks) and/or coarse hemp cloth will not be allowed to be transported out of the Public Concession without a transfer permit, except for transport to the French Concession. Anyone who violates this announcement and transports various empty sacks and/or hemp cloth without a permit will have the sacks or cloth transported confiscated by this Bureau without further compensation. This special announcement is hereby made for the information of all. This announcement is dated May 19th, 1942 in the Western calendar.

### No Definite Plans for Evacuating British and American Nationals, Existing Plans Are Uncertain and Subject to Change, Disagreement on Several Issues

It has recently been rumored that British and American officials and civilians in Shanghai will evacuate to Mages in East Africa on the Italian ship Conte Verde and a Japanese mail ship around the 2nd or 10th of next month to exchange for Japanese nationals. According to well-informed sources, this is purely speculation. Although there are plans for evacuation at present, it is impossible to predict in advance when it will be implemented or how it will be implemented in today's volatile environment. Even if some British and American people are packing their luggage and preparing to depart, it is still uncertain.

Whether It Can Be Done, It Cannot Be Asserted

British and American citizens have never had a definite guarantee about the evacuation. They only claim that there are no new developments to report. According to an official at the American Consulate, he believes that if a ship sails to Africa early next month, he, as a consular official, will be able to leave here. However, changes in the situation are unpredictable. Whether it can be done is impossible to assert until the last moment. In principle, diplomatic and consular officials have the highest priority for evacuation, followed by quasi-official personnel, and then by expatriates who have gathered in Shanghai from other places. The hope that British and American nationals in this city can evacuate early next month is very slim.

Disagreement on the Number of People

It is also learned that the Swiss Consulate General, which is responsible for taking care of the interests of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American nationals have some disagreement on the number of people to be evacuated in the first batch. The Swiss Consulate believes that the number of people to be evacuated should be limited to the normal capacity of the ship. However, British and American nationals insist that the ship should be loaded as much as possible, and that as many nationals as possible should be evacuated in the first batch, in addition to diplomatic and consular personnel. However, some people believe that if the ship carries too many people, there may be unexpected events during the long voyage. Therefore, the result will still be based on the opinion of the Swiss Consulate.

American Nationals Eager to Return Home

Current Observation: It has been found that American nationals are more eager to evacuate and return home than British nationals. British nationals have a longer history in Shanghai, and returning home would not only place them under the direct threat of war, but also make it difficult to find the most appropriate solution to the problem of livelihood. It is better to stay here. The American people want to take the opportunity to find a way to return home as soon as possible, so that the family can reunite and avoid being separated in two places. The reason for this is that many family members returned home after October of the year before last, and now that the war has broken out, there is no news from them. Most of the American nationals who are willing to return home under the principle of exchange are for this reason.

Some Nationals Do Not Want to Leave Shanghai

However, there are also many American nationals who do not want to evacuate. Most of them are missionaries and those who still have fixed jobs and no family concerns. They believe that they may not be able to find a job opportunity similar to Shanghai after returning home, and they are not willing to risk a long voyage during wartime. They would rather continue to live here, and their economic aspects are still guaranteed, because the funds transferred by the government through the Red Cross have not been interrupted, and they have been loaned and subsidized by the Swiss Consulate and the Expatriate Association. If the standard of living continues to rise in the future, the amount of assistance received will also be increased appropriately. Since there is no worry about life and safety can be guaranteed, there is no need to evacuate unless forced to do so.

### Zhongjiao Daoyi Society Distributes Porridge

In view of the soaring prices and the difficult livelihoods of the poor, the Zhongjiao Daoyi Society on Tongfu Road in this city has not only established a small-scale loan office to give the poor the opportunity to become self-reliant, but also continues to distribute porridge. However, rice is quite difficult to obtain. Although the food administration office issues monthly signatures for procurement, it is still felt to be very insufficient. Yesterday, the International Red Cross allocated 300 bags of broken wheat, which is also good news for the poor.

### Pengshoutang Distributes Powdered Sha Medicine

Pengshoutang Pharmacy in Eight Immortals Bridge has been donating medicines for many years, often spending tens of thousands of yuan. This year, due to the high cost of glass bottles, the cost of manufacturing Sha medicine water has increased. Therefore, it has switched to manufacturing powdered Sha medicine to help the world. The function is the same as Sha medicine water, but without the cost of bottling the Sha medicine water, more medicinal materials can be added. The selling price is cheaper, 10 yuan for every 40 doses. A special gift was given on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month (Friday), with one box given for every two boxes of powdered medicine purchased. The other day, 20,000 packets of powdered Sha medicine were entrusted to the Charity Department of the Jueyuan Buddhist Jingye Society on Hede Road for distribution to other places.

### Letter

To the Editor, I have read the news about the dispute at the Dazhong Funeral Home in your newspaper's fourth page, which stated that it has been "sealed and closed for business". The Far East Company and Dazhong Funeral Home have not had a lawsuit, how can there be facts of being sealed. Also, our funeral home is operating as usual. It is obvious that the rumors are untrue and should be corrected. Sincerely, Dazhong Funeral Home, May 19.

### Veteran Ping Pong Player Chen Linsheng Makes a Comeback

Mr. Chen Linsheng, a veteran ping pong player, has been away from the scene for a long time, which has been of concern to the sports community. Mr. Chen is a pioneer in the ping pong world, and countless young people have been taught by him. In the past, Mr. Chen invented "Ground Ping Pong" and "Wall Ping Pong", and also created hard ball ping pong competitions, which refreshed the ping pong world. Unfortunately, Mr. Chen temporarily abandoned his activities for some reason, and the ping pong scene in this city suddenly became silent. Last autumn, he was hired by Mr. Huang Yuzhai to serve as an assistant in the Trust Department of the Huizhong Bank Head Office. Because Huizhong has added a Cad Road branch, Mr. Cheng Zhiliang was honorably appointed as manager, and Mr. Chen was also transferred to the branch to serve. It is said that he intends to make a comeback in his spare time due to the urging of various parties. He was specially invited to serve as a member of the "Youth Cup Ping Pong Competition" launched by the Youth Association recently. It is expected that the ping pong world in this city will return to its past prosperity from now on.

### Military Notes Reappear, Premium on Cash Rises, Rumors of Over 1,000 Yuan per 10,000 Yuan

Foreign currency market conditions: British and American gold pounds are still stable, the former is still 520 yuan, and the latter is still 503 yuan. US dollar notes are as high as about 34 yuan, and Hong Kong notes are 4 yuan and 85 cents. Military notes once rose to 8 yuan and 18 cents in the afternoon, and finally settled at 8 yuan, an increase of 35 cents compared to the previous day.

The discount rate of the Money Industry Association is still open at 15 points. The discount rate for cleared bills gradually increased from 60 yuan per 1,000 yuan, reached 100 yuan for the second time, and finally 90 yuan and 95 yuan, which was 43 yuan higher than the previous day. It is heard that the cash chips in the market are being searched for by all parties and are becoming less and less. In addition, the reserve notes are rising in price, and the outflow of cash is even more prosperous. There are rumors in the market of restricting withdrawals and deposits, and people are even more nervous. The premium on cash is getting higher and higher.

Yesterday (the 19th), the opening price of Central Reserve notes was 1.4 yuan in legal tender per yuan. Later, due to a premium of 1,000 yuan per 10,000 yuan of legal tender, there were news of changes in listed market prices, and the price gradually rose, reaching a maximum of 1.6 yuan, and the closing price was around 1.55 yuan.

### Raw Gold Eagerly Bought, Surging Past 23,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the black market for raw gold rose sharply. Due to the soaring discount rate for legal tender, securities firms came back to buy after selling, and there were reports of advances from Tianjin. The price rose sharply, flying beyond 23,000 yuan, and the market sentiment was very good. In the early morning, securities firms sold 10 taels per bar (10 taels), for 21,650 yuan. Soon, amid buying from gold shops and certain silver houses, the price began to rise. Another securities merchant also came to buy, and it gradually rose to 1,150 yuan, reaching 22,800 yuan. Seeing silver houses and certain money shops in Tianjin selling up to 22,450 yuan, after 10:30, securities firms came back to buy and actively pushed up the price. Although cash shops were selling, financial circles were vying to buy. At noon, it rose to 22,950 yuan, an increase of 1,350 yuan from the previous day, with a difference of 1,300 yuan. Finally, it rose to 23,700 yuan, and the transaction was brisk.

Jewelry shops stepped up their prices by 150 yuan per tael, to 2,350 yuan (200 yuan less for purchases). Refined silver was listed at 18 yuan, and the black market rose to 15.78 yuan. Silver coins were 9.56 yuan each.

### Bond Market Chaotic and Inexplicable, Type D Drops to Limit Again

In the unofficial market for public bonds, the market was still in a turbulent sea yesterday. The rise and fall of market prices were dizzying. Type D actually fell by more than 4 yuan and was suspended. Type C not only did not fall, but rose by 3 cents, because it had already fallen to the limit the day before. However, Type E also fell to the limit the day before and then fell by more than 1 yuan. The chaos in the market cannot be explained by common sense. Large households were selling off, but only Type D and Type E. Because Type C had no large sales, speculators hurriedly made up for their positions. In the tension, households had no time to calculate, resulting in this unreasonable situation. At the moment, the difference between Type A and Type E is more than 12.8 yuan, and the difference between Type A and Type B is 8.5 yuan, which is far from the normal distance. Type E should be considered cheap and Type A expensive, but the market is "out of its mind" and cannot be calculated by normal standards. In short, although the selling was extremely fierce, there were still buyers to receive it, indicating that bonds would never be abandoned. The majority of the absorption should be attributed to the financial world, accounting for three-quarters, and the rest was bought by individuals. This kind of blow will eventually be overcome. Yesterday, Tongsheng Huichang took the lead in selling, and Zhongli came to sell Type D and Type E in the middle of the day. The market price then changed abnormally. There were also Hengyu Hongda Tongkang Tongyuan Lemao, etc. selling, but the number was small. There were no significant large buyers. If Lianhe Hongxing Trust Zhongwu He Yuan He Renfeng Lianyi Chengkang Runli Dechang Baolong Yongchang and other families had absorbed the shares, the result was that Type A, Type D, and Type E fell by 5 cents to 4 yuan. Type B was unchanged, and Type C rose by 3 cents. The transaction was about 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Letter from Dakangcheng Securities: To the Editor: We have read the news about the public bond market in your commercial news column on May 19th, which stated that "Dakangcheng also had 500,000 yuan". After checking, our firm has stopped buying and selling public bonds for several months. The above news must be due to untrue rumors. Please correct it.

### Stock Market Also Turns Strong

### The Boom in the Yarn Market Depends Entirely on Speculation, Actual Sales Have Completely Stalled

The spot situation of cotton yarn remains firm and expensive. This is because the premium on banknotes has soared, causing speculative buying to rebound. However, actual transactions have completely stalled. 42s Blue Phoenix was 16,650 yuan to 17,000 yuan, retreated in the middle to 16,600 yuan, and the closing price was 17,050 yuan. 42s Water Moon was 15,800 yuan, 42s Yanghe was 15,700 yuan, 80s Color Ball was 39,800 yuan, 32s Golden Pagoda was 16,150 yuan, 32s Songlu was 13,100 yuan, 32s Xiantao was 14,250 yuan, 2-strand 60s Five Sons was 26,500 yuan, 20s Blue Phoenix was 9,300 yuan, 20s Water Moon was 8,800 yuan, 20s Yueqin was 8,350 yuan, 20s Double Horse was 8,100 yuan to 8,400 yuan, 20s Earth was 7,900 yuan to 8,000 yuan, 16s Golden Bridge was 8,200 yuan, 10s Red Double Horse was 6,700 yuan to 6,850 yuan, 10s Boy Scout was 6,850 yuan to 6,800 yuan, 10s Golden Bridge was 6,600 yuan, 10s Deli was 3,650 yuan, 80s Three Tigers was 6,600 yuan, 20s Double Horse factory single opened at 6,200 yuan, shortly rose to 6,320 yuan, then multiterm retreated and eased to 6,120 yuan, but rose again to 6,400 yuan after closing. At present, the yarn market is becoming more and more prosperous due to speculative buying.

### Cotton Cloth Follows Military Scrip

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market was affected by the wild surge of military scrip and savings certificates, causing unrest among the people. Hoarders increased their purchases, driving the prices of all types of cloth higher and higher. Coarse and fine cloths both rose sharply by seven to ten yuan per bolt. Sixteen-pound "Globe" coarse cloth was quoted at 280 yuan for future sales, while "Flying Goose" was at 270 yuan. Twelve-pound "Globe" fine cloth opened in the morning at 245 yuan, gradually rising to 251 yuan in the afternoon. "Fu Gui" fine cloth was at 248.5 yuan, fine twill at 220 yuan, and "Fu Gui" factory single at 187 yuan. "Peach Blossom Lady" and "Lin" cloth reached a high of 391 yuan, "Chick" at 386 yuan, and "Longevity" silk crepe at 8 yuan to 8.2 yuan.

Eastern Cloth: The rising trend was rampant, like madness, with no one knowing where it would end. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened in the morning at 320 yuan, closing at 325 yuan at noon. The afternoon opened at 332 yuan, and in a rush, it reached 340 yuan. Those who bought low and sold high made substantial profits, and many began to sell, causing the price to drop to 328 yuan. It then rallied again to close at 332.5 yuan, a further increase of sixteen yuan per bolt compared to the previous day.

### Peach Meat Drops

There was a shortage of peach meat from out of town and the amount offered for sale was limited. However, due to seasonal factors, the price continued to ease by twenty to thirty yuan. Yesterday, the market price was 580 to 590 yuan. Hand-picked peaches were at 300 yuan, while smaller ones were priced at 120 yuan. Southern peaches saw no change, remaining at 220 yuan. The market situation was flat.

Entertainment Scene

### Movies and Location Shooting

— Ji Xin

The greatest advantage of movies over stage plays is that they can freely change backgrounds without being restricted by the stage, allowing the audience to experience more realistic sensations. Since the Shanghai film industry underwent many environmental changes, the films produced have generally been criticized by audiences as not being as good as pre-war works. In addition to shoddy production, a major reason for this is the lack of good backgrounds as a backdrop. Originally, this was understandable. In the past, when transportation to the suburbs was inconvenient, it was impossible to capture natural location shots. The camera was always filming artificial sets, which naturally made audiences feel uncomfortable watching movies through such a narrow lens. Now, movie stars can travel freely between Beijing and Shanghai, and film companies should no longer be restricted in shooting location scenes. It is hoped that film industry workers will be able to step out of the studio in the future and introduce the fertile land to every Chinese person. Otherwise, if movies do not capture location scenes, they will lose their precious value and bury the future of film art!

### Cao Huilin's Two Operas

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

I went to see the new star Cao Huilin's debut performance at the Great Stage on the first two days. On the first day, she performed four scenes from "Wang Baochuan": "Wujiapo," "Calculating Military Provisions," "Empty Mountain," and "Ascending the Palace." Huilin's appearance was extremely beautiful, thanks to the appropriate use of rouge, and her face was expressive. Her water sleeves were very skillful, and her voice was sufficient. Her singing style imitated Yan Qiu a lot, and the "er liu" aria in "Ascending the Palace" was quite similar, earning her much praise. On the second day, her makeup in "Visiting Mother" was even better, and her costumes were also quite beautiful. She sang both slow and fast tempos well, repeatedly winning applause. Her voice was wider and brighter than on the first day, and her pitch was very high. She sang the fast tempo duet with Lin Shusen with ease, showing her deep skill. Huilin comes from Qinhuai, but her accomplishments are comparable to those of the famous Peking Opera masters. If she can continue to study diligently and strive for improvement, her future will be limitless! I write these few words to encourage her to work harder.

### After Seeing "Shadow of Red Tears"

— Zhu Fujian

"Shadow of Red Tears" is the third collaboration between Hu Feng and Shu Shi. After "Tears on Flowers" and "Peach Blossom Lake" were released, they left a deep impression on the audience's minds. Now, with the addition of Sun Jinglu and Qiao Qi, and based on their past achievements, this lineup is expected to be good.

The film tells the story of a love triangle between two adopted sisters with different personalities, Mei Nong and Ai Lian, and a young man named Yi Li. The plot is roughly as follows: Mei Nong is the daughter of a certain wealthy man who was abandoned by her feudal family. Her identity is that of a "illegitimate daughter." She has been secretly raised by the Dai family, old neighbors in Hong Kong. Ai Lian is the Dai family's daughter, and the two sisters grew up together. However, neither of the sisters understands the situation. Their cousin, Yi Li, is ordered to go to Hong Kong to bring them back to Shanghai. Ai Lian, however, is glorified among relatives and friends as the legitimate daughter of the wealthy Hao Bai, while Mei Nong experiences cold treatment. The only person who can comfort her is Yi Li. At that time, Ai Lian is also in love with Yi Li, and her father, due to his nephew Yi Li's handsome and promising nature, intends to choose him as his son-in-law. However, Mei Nong and Yi Li have already secretly become engaged. Relying on Ai Lian's wealth and beauty, she is ultimately unable to obtain Yi Li, so she secretly hatches a poisonous plan to murder Mei Nong. Unexpectedly, Yi Li sees through her plan. Under strict questioning, Dai Pozi reveals the truth: Mei Nong is actually the wealthy man's legitimate daughter. With the obstacle removed, Yi Li and Mei Nong become husband and wife, and the old man Hao Bai also gets his wish.

Sun Jinglu, Hu Feng, and Shu Shi play Ai Lian, Mei Nong, and Yi Li, respectively. Sun Jinglu's Ai Lian is the most lively and moving. She vividly portrays the spoiled attitude of a rich young lady. Hu Feng and Shu Shi also perform very well. In particular, Shu Shi's bright eyes vividly portray an energetic young man.

— Xin Juan

In addition to the concerts by Zhao Meibo's talented students Sun Jinshen, Chen Enmei, and Ms. Li Huifang reported in this column last week, I have also gathered several more concert announcements to inform readers:

### Amateur Opera Singer Xu Wanqiu

— Yu

Xu Wanqiu, also known as Shuzi, works at the post office. Since childhood, he has loved Peking Opera and has privately studied under Wan Hua and Gui Qiu, imitating them with great effort. His singing is sweet and smooth, very similar to Gui Qiu, almost indistinguishable, hence the reputation of "Little Huang Gui Qiu." He is proficient in no less than ten operas. Masterpieces of the Mei School, such as "The Universe's Edge," "The Hate of Life and Death," and "Spring and Autumn Match," are all his specialties. Today, at the invitation of the Gu family, he will perform "Spring and Autumn Match" with the famous amateur xiaosheng Yan Yizhi at the Ningbo Fellow Association. It is also heard that when his colleagues at the post office rehearse next month, Xu will perform the entire "The Hate of Life and Death," a masterpiece of the Mei School.

### Stormy Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Returning Kindness

Magpie came to ask Cui Zhen why she was inviting guests for dinner. Guo Fang had already heard this and said, "My brother and I have agreed that the first thing we do when we get here is to ask Wei Cheng for two pieces of white cloth and pay our respects to our aunt's portrait. The second thing is to visit our second aunt. Dinner should be put later." Wei Cheng kept saying that he dared not accept such honor, but he also knew that he couldn't disobey. Guo Qi, wearing a Western suit, hung the white cloth from his left shoulder, tying a knot around his right waist; Guo Fang always liked to dress in bright red and green colors, but today she only wore a blue-black checkered cotton cheongsam, which showed how sincerely she came to offer condolences. After paying their respects, Madam Ye Er came out to express her thanks, and then they ate.

Outside, the banquet was already in a state of disarray with scattered dishes. Wei Cheng asked the kitchen to set up another table inside. He knew that the older generation, Guo Qi and his sister, would not be perfunctory; the relatives and neighbors of similar age, whether male or female, were either crude or laughably naive. So he only pulled Cui Zhen to accompany them. Cui Zhen said, "I can't, I have a lot to do: the Taoist priest is here to chant scriptures, they have to find me; the kitchen needs rock sugar and monosodium glutamate, they have to come find me. There are people who haven't had dinner, I have to go find them." Guo Fang held onto her sleeve and refused to let go, saying, "It's not wrong to call you the chief housekeeper: unlike me, who is supposed to be a friend, but doesn't help at all, and instead needs to be entertained. But I want Sister Cui Zhen to entertain me." Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cui Zhen, you've heard what Miss Chen said, quickly sit down. Tonight, accompany us, and tomorrow I will ask Miss Chen to entertain my female guests." Cui Zhen sat down and poured a round of wine; Wei Cheng still didn't drink, only pretending to use his chopsticks, telling people to eat and drink. (80)
