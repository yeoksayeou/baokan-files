Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army spokesman recently revealed at a local governor's conference held here that after the first naval battle outside the Solomon Islands, Japanese warships responded to land operations and achieved brilliant victories. Japanese forces then gradually approached the US forces in the Solomon Islands area. A small Japanese naval unit occupied Guadalcanal Island. A large number of US troops landed in various areas near the island in August. Japanese forces immediately exerted significant pressure on these US troops. After the US forces entered this area, Japanese forces cooperated closely with the Japanese Navy, overcoming significant difficulties, and continuously carried out landings. The US side then reinforced its land, sea, and air forces, attempting to maintain its own defense line. Although the Solomon area is far from the Japanese operational base in the South Pacific, the Japanese side is still able to transport supplies to the area and carry out landings. The enemy's attempt to disrupt the peace and order of Burma under Japanese administration through aerial guerrilla warfare has been thwarted by Japanese air raids on the Tinsukia in Assam and Chittagong in Bengal, destroying more than 50 enemy aircraft. Enemy air forces, departing from bases in eastern India and Yunnan, attempted to continuously attack Burma, but enemy aircraft were repelled without achieving any battle results. Japanese squadrons also continuously attacked enemy aircraft departing from inland bases on the Chinese front. The enemy's attempt to use a small number of aircraft for guerrilla warfare has been defeated by the Japanese side. The Japanese side shot down or destroyed a total of 43 enemy aircraft. Japanese aircraft losses include four aircraft destroyed by crashing into targets and six aircraft that have not returned to base.

### Holders of Old Legal Tender Should Exchange Them Quickly

The provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, as well as the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, began the final exchange of old legal tender for new currency on the first of this month. Since the beginning of the exchange, the results have been excellent. In the Shanghai area, almost all hidden old legal tender has been recovered. In the rural inland areas, cooperatives have a major responsibility in the recovery of old legal tender. Cooperatives, in addition to instructing each branch and township office to handle the exchange, have also organized mobile teams to dispatch to rural areas to facilitate the exchange for inland farmers. As the value of old legal tender has been declining recently in the inland areas, there has been no shortage of people coming to exchange them. At the same time, the National Government has ordered provinces to send personnel to supervise the Reserve Bank, and has also increased the number of staff at various branch offices to promote the exchange of old and new legal tender in the inland areas. From December 1st onward, not only is the use and carrying of old legal tender prohibited, but possession and safekeeping are also absolutely forbidden. Anyone who knowingly violates the law and secretly hoards it will, upon discovery, have it confiscated and be severely punished. Therefore, it is hoped that those who still possess old legal tender should exchange them as soon as possible to protect their rights and interests.

### Murder of Dance Hostess Hua Liying Solved Within 24 Hours, Two Murderers Apprehended Using Gold Bracelet as a Clue, Patrons Generously Arrange for Burial, Orphan Adopted

The murder of Hua Liying, a dance hostess at the MGM Dance Hall on Yuqiaqing Road, occurred the previous evening (13th). This newspaper reported the situation yesterday. The French Concession Police Department paid special attention to the case, diligently investigating it and apprehending the murderers within 24 hours of the incident. Details are as follows: After receiving a report, the French Concession Police Department dispatched experienced detectives to investigate. Hua Liying, a native of Suzhou, was 22 years old. After the outbreak of the war, she went to Hong Kong and continued her career as a dance hostess. Because of the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th of last year, she decided to return to Shanghai, but she was already six months pregnant. In late June, she purchased a ship ticket and sailed to Shanghai. At that time, the fetus was full-term and she gave birth on the ship on the 28th (the 15th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar). The entire crew considered it a strange event. After arriving in Shanghai, she rented a room on the second floor of Hengmaoli No. 74, Mintiniyin Road, in the French Concession, and hired Wang Wu as a nanny. She also rented the pavilion room on the second floor of No. 75 next door as her residence. Hua Liying was introduced to MGM by a younger colleague as a dance hostess, but she did not have a fixed location, specializing in sitting at tables upon request. She was amiable and well-liked by patrons, with an average monthly income of 6,000 to 10,000 yuan in dance tickets. She had been at MGM for less than three months. Every night she returned to her residence and entered through the back door. The residents of the same building were already asleep. However, occasionally on Saturday or Sunday nights around 12:00 AM, they heard someone knocking on the door. Around 9:00 AM on the 13th, before the incident, the nanny went to Hua's room to tidy up as usual. Unexpectedly, after opening the door, the objects in the room were in disarray. Hua's head and face were covered with a large towel and she was silent. Realizing something had happened, she immediately reported the incident to the police. The detectives were dispatched to the scene of the incident to investigate. A receipt from a silver shop was found in the room, indicating that the deceased had purchased a fashionable gold bracelet on the 10th of this month, which was missing. Based on the circumstances, it appeared to be a case of murder for money. They immediately notified various silver shops and pawnshops to be on the lookout. Yesterday morning, Yongcheng Pawnshop at No. 464 Xifei Road discovered that someone had pawned a thirteen-diamond ring, a gold watch, and a gold locket. Furthermore, Lutianbao Silver Shop on Mintiniyin Road received a gold pound, a fashionable gold bracelet, and a gold chain. The detectives immediately went to the above two locations to inquire and learned that the pawner of the ornaments was Zhang Hongsheng, 22 years old, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 10 Jinde Lane, Chengdu Road. The detectives went to this location to search and arrest him. Zhang was out, but his family said that he had a concubine named Jiang Yun, who had also worked as a dance hostess, 19 years old, residing at No. 5 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. The detectives went to this address again, but she was also out. Jiang Yun was arrested. According to her, Zhang Hongsheng was at Room 426 of the Cangzhou Hotel. The detectives, after apprehending the murderers, immediately went with Jiang Yun to investigate. They learned that Zhang Hongsheng had gone out with a foreign woman. Remaining in the room until 11:45 AM, Hongsheng returned to the residence and was immediately arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. He also confessed to his accomplice, Jiang Yilong, 19 years old, residing at No. 486 Qipu Road. They went to arrest him and brought him to the police station, along with the nanny for questioning. Zhang Hongsheng confessed that he knew Hua Liying in Hong Kong. Zhang returned to Shanghai first, and Hua returned to Shanghai at the end of June. They had not seen each other for a long time and only recently met at the MGM Dance Hall. After Zhang saw Hua, he repeatedly asked her for money, but Hua refused. The murder took place around 12:00 AM on the 13th of this month, when Zhang went to Hua's residence with his classmate Jiang Yilong to ask for money again. Hua firmly refused. Zhang then conceived the idea of murder, and Jiang assisted him. They used a tie to strangle Hua to death and took all the gold ornaments and valuables, carrying the stolen goods out the door at 1:30 AM. The police station detained them according to their confession. The murderers' family background: Zhang Hongsheng and Jiang Yilong are both sons of wealthy families. Hongsheng's father, Zhang Zuohan, is 42 years old and currently serves as the manager of the Jincheng Trading Company. He also independently owns a large-scale Western-style clothing store with hundreds of thousands of yuan in assets. Jiang Yilong is also the son of a wealthy merchant, but the family situation is unknown. Both criminals are only sons. Because they do not engage in legitimate work and are accustomed to being degenerate, bad feelings have developed between father and son, and economic support has not been given, leading them to evil paths. After obtaining the ornaments from Hua and pawning them, they went to a gambling den in Nanshi and gambled everything away in one shot. They returned to their residence dejected and were eventually arrested. The wheels of justice turn slowly, but surely. Burial Arrangements: Hua's body was claimed from the coroner's office yesterday by her friend, Zhou Peide (35 years old, Shanghai resident, owner of the Wufu Charcoal Factory at No. 32 Husi Anhe Temple Road, No. 70 Luban Road). It was transported to the Shanghai Funeral Parlor for burial arrangements. Her family will be notified to come to Shanghai to claim and bury it. Adoption of the Orphan: It is also reported that the child Hua gave birth to is the result of a relationship with a wealthy merchant surnamed Zhu, who is currently in Hong Kong. Hua had mentioned to people before that she had resentment. Now that she has met with misfortune, the child is still being raised by the nanny. It is less than five months old and has already suffered great misfortune. It is said that it will be adopted by the mother's younger colleagues in the future. It is currently living in the pavilion room at No. 75 Hengmaoli. (The above picture is a small portrait of Hua Liying.)

The long-awaited Tongren Cup All-Shanghai Charity Table Tennis Championship will be held at the Metropolitan Ballroom at the intersection of Gordon Road and Avenue Road starting at 2:00 PM this afternoon.

Chuan Guiqing and Feng Chanchu will serve as referees, and Zhu Zhijin and Cheng Shuming will serve as inspectors. Qinglian is a rising star. This time, they have made a surprising appearance. Huang Min, Zhang Fuwei, Yang Changxi, and the Chang Jia Kun brothers are all brave and good at fighting. Their skills have become more and more refined. Their talents are well-rounded. Their strength is obviously strong. Sanyi is led by table tennis giants Chen Jimao and Cui Gongchao. It has a long history in the table tennis world. It owns the famous defensive player Zhang Ying, the topspin expert Chuan Qifang, Han Dewei, the short-game expert Wang Jingyuan, and the all-around players Zhang Yongchang and Pu Kungang. Their lineup is very strong, and it is no less than the rising star Qinglian. At that time, once they meet, the outcome will determine the overall championship.

There will definitely be a wonderful performance. Tickets are divided into four types: two yuan, five yuan, twenty-five yuan, and honorary coupons of one hundred yuan. All ticket income will be used for the free medical clinic and medicine expenses of Tongren Hospital. This is a great cause, and it is hoped that all benevolent audiences will come and watch and generously donate to benefit the poor and sick.

Therefore, most businesses are accepting post-dated checks and offering credit sales, while also secretly expanding to other cities. These include nearby cities like Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and distant cities like Hankou, Tianjin, Jiangxi, and Sichuan. Furthermore, due to the recent increase in woolen fabric costs, powerful players in the industry, capitalizing on the substantial profits of the past two years, are jointly forming companies.

### A Mother's Needlework

— Hua

As the weather gradually turns cold, many mothers are busy sewing winter clothes for their children, painstakingly doing stitch after stitch, with each stitch filled with a mother's love.

Making a piece of clothing requires a lot of time, but mothers never find it a burden, as they believe it is their responsibility.

In families with many children, mothers are even busier. The eldest son's coat is half a length too short, the second son's pants no longer fit, the third son's socks are torn, the fourth son's running shoes have holes... Every change of season, every change in the weather, keeps them busy. Therefore, if we want to judge how hardworking a child's mother is, we only need to look at the clothes the child wears. It goes without saying that children should be filial to their parents.

In one of Mr. Ge's letters, there was a sentence: "You cannot choose your own mother, but you can choose your children's mother." This is true. Men who are looking for a partner should keep this in mind and choose a woman who can take responsibility for household matters, so that their family can be happy.

### Enthusiastic Donations for Winter Clothing Drive

Since this publication featured the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) winter clothing drive in the last issue, all sectors of society have responded enthusiastically and made generous donations. To date, donations have exceeded ten thousand yuan, and several hundred pieces of old winter clothing have been received, demonstrating the charitable spirit of the community and the readers of this newspaper. The association is currently ordering fabrics and cotton clothing to be sewn as soon as possible for distribution. The association's donation goal of thirty thousand yuan is not a large sum, and given the size of Shanghai and the number of enthusiastic individuals, it should not be difficult to raise the full amount in a short period of time. As the north wind rises and winter clothing is urgently needed, it is hoped that all sectors and families will continue to act on the principle of "saving lives as if putting out a fire" and generously donate to provide relief. To facilitate donations of money or clothing from all sectors, this issue of the Family section includes a form to be filled out and sent to the YWCA, so that this project can be completed as soon as possible. The association's collection locations are listed below: (1) YWCA headquarters at 638 Weihaiwei Road, (2) YWCA Nursery at 66 Daxi Road, (3) YWCA Dormitory at 206 Yuanyuan Road, (4) YWCA Dormitory at 8, Lane 1086 Yuyuan Road.

The association has received the following donations:

Mr. Jing: 2,000 yuan

Mr. Wang: 1,000 yuan

We are very grateful for the enthusiasm and charity of the above individuals, and we hope that all sectors will continue to donate generously.

### Help Yourself, Help Others

— Han

Living in Shanghai every day, you may doubt whether you are in the human world. Every time you come out of your warm home and see the majestic skyscrapers along the road, and hear the intoxicating music coming from the grand hotels, elegantly dressed ladies pass by carrying bouquets of flowers, and you can only smell the fragrance of clothes and flowers. Such a place must be a paradise rather than a troubled human world. But the corpses lying by the roadside are shocking, and the cries of hunger and cold in the northwest wind will break your heart and bring you to tears. Moreover, in the slums that you have never visited or even thought about, there are thousands of your fellow human beings struggling in poverty and suffering. If you see and think about these things, you will doubt that you have gone to hell. Paradise and hell coexist, and this is Shanghai. A rabbit mourns for a dead fox, and people sympathize with their own kind. How can we, as the most intelligent of all creatures, stand idly by when we see our fellow human beings falling into decline? In this environment, you will understand that "help yourself, help others" is not just a simple sermon, but an emotional appeal!

### Twenty Letters from the Ge Family

— Translated by Xu Baiyi

Mr. Ge Laiheng's son's business profits are not commensurate with his expenses, so Mr. Ge Laiheng wrote a letter hoping that he would improve.

His meaning is that he wants him to seek the other half of knowledge beyond the half that he already knows, because the remaining half is the most useful half. This sentence is a small mistake. In addition to the existing knowledge, adding half more will make him a perfect talent.

Eleventh Letter Strive for Perfection My dear son:

According to your business report for last month, your business is not very good, but the expenses are very large. Fortunately, on the whole, it is still within the prescribed range, but it is already very reluctant.

I don't want to be too harsh on you when you have just started your sales career. But I will be happier if you can immediately show your failure or success, because it is not a good thing to muddle along like this. According to my observation, it seems that you are only exerting half of your strength. You only do half of the things, only take half of the money, and only occupy half of the position, which is a loss to you. However, if you want to get the other half, you have to add the other half of the effort to the half of the effort you are doing now. You must understand our products from beginning to end, know everything about live pigs and canned pork, just like a mother can understand what her child is saying, and a young father loves his twelve-pound child.

You have to treat your customers with the best attitude, you have to use all your energy to deal with business solicitations, and you have to make up your mind when you get up in the morning to be able to satisfy yourself when you go to bed at night. You must eat pork and think about pork, and there is nothing but pork in the daytime and in your dreams, then you can know everything about the canned pork business.

In the past few weeks, you can get practical experience in soliciting business. In the future, you can make every effort to study the situation of the catering company in your spare time during travel. When you ask many questions, you can develop great interest in the job you are doing, thus making a basic for promotion.

I don't say that a person who has half of the knowledge is useless, but according to my experience, the other half of the experience is often of great use. Therefore, what a person engaged in sales work needs to know is everything about manufacturing.

There are many things you can learn from this catering canned food business, and it is by no means a short period of time that you can complete your learning work. I hope you can happily improve and make me feel that you are indeed wholeheartedly doing business (not only on the days of getting paid, but also on the other days). I hope you can use all your time to fill your mind, and when you need it, you can take out the goods stored in your mind.

Now, the work you are doing is similar to that of other salesmen. I hope you can grow up quickly, grow up so healthy, great, and full, so that we can see you occupying a prominent position among your colleagues, and others seem very small in front of you. Your father Ge Laiheng

### Shanghai YWCA sews winter clothes

"A mother's hand holds the thread, clothing for the wanderer's body" These two short sentences contain the mother's incomparably great love for her children.

The weather is really going to be cold in the blink of an eye. In this turbulent era, mothers and children are separated from each other. Even in Shanghai, which we are in paradise, I don’t know how many wandering children are struggling for their remaining lives on this bleak rainy and bitter cold night. Their stomachs are entangled by hunger and their bodies are attacked by the fierce wind. Hunger, cold! How urgently they are looking forward to their mother’s winter clothes, and how eagerly they are asking for people’s help.

The YWCA's winter clothing donation has exceeded 10,000 yuan since the fund-raising campaign was launched last week, with the warm support of all sectors of society. It is said that the association is already preparing to purchase fabrics and cotton clothing in advance, and will start sewing after everything is ready.

Would you also like to be a social mother? When you pick up your sewing needle to sew clothes for your beloved child, have you ever thought of these many miserable children who need it hundreds of times more than your own children? Loving mothers, please extend your love for your children. Please join the YWCA's winter clothing sewing campaign for miserable children. Those with comfortable family circumstances can send cash, and those who have the strength can introduce economical fabric factories, cotton factories, or volunteer to sew winter clothes.

When this new winter clothing is delivered to the hands of these many miserable children, how happy and joyful will they be?

### Breastfeeding Knowledge

— Zhu Ying

(Continued from last week)

Infants over five months old have gradually increased their food intake and digestion, and have reached the period of teething. In addition to liquids, easily digestible semi-solid foods such as rice porridge and oatmeal can be added. All must be cooked thoroughly until they are like a paste. Infants of five or six months can be fed porridge twice a day, initially one tablespoon each time, and then gradually increased to four tablespoons, at 10 a.m. and 6 p.m.

After six months, the iron stored in the infant's belly gradually runs out. If they are only fed milk or other nutrients lacking in iron, anemia will inevitably occur. It is essential to gradually ingest foods rich in iron, such as spinach and egg yolk, as supplementary food. Vegetables and fruits are not only rich in iron and vitamins, but also have a lubricating effect on the intestines. Infants over seven months old can eat vegetable puree, and infants of nine or ten months can eat cooked fruit puree. Vegetable puree and fruit puree can replace orange juice and vegetable juice. In fact, by the time infants are eight months old, breastfeeding should be done three times, at 6 a.m., 2 p.m., and 10 p.m.

2. Weaning The weaning time should be between eight and twelve months, but it should not be carried out in summer. This is because infants have relatively weak digestion in the hot weather, and food is also easily spoiled. Nutritional disorders are likely to occur after weaning. Weaning should be gradual. Starting from the sixth month, supplementary foods can be used. Give one or two teaspoons of fresh fruit juice two or three times a day before breastfeeding. After the eighth month, first reduce breastfeeding once and replace it with milk, milk powder, soy milk, or finely ground mashed potatoes. Then gradually reduce the number of breastfeeding sessions and replace them with supplementary food. By about the twelfth month, weaning can be completely completed.

After weaning, attention should still be paid to food. If the nutrition is not up to standard, the weight will not increase or even decrease, teething will be delayed, vomiting and regurgitation will occur, diarrhea and constipation will occur, the body will be thin, and the skin will be loose. If artificial nutrition was used before weaning and obstacles occur, it is advisable to quickly switch to human milk. If there is a lack of vitamins, use foods rich in vitamins, because the nutrients required by infants are the same as those of adults. In addition to the three major nutrients of protein, carbohydrates, and fat, as well as salts and water, there is also a need for the supply of vitamins. Among children, there are those who are stubborn and unwilling to wean from breast milk. At this time, ginger juice or a 1% quinine (i.e., quinine) solution and other bad-tasting substances can be applied to the nipples to prevent this.

3. Hiring a wet nurse: The best food for breastfeeding infants is breast milk, but under special circumstances, it is also not suitable for self-feeding, such as those suffering from tuberculosis and those who are too weak or infected with acute infectious diseases are not suitable for breastfeeding. In this case, only wet nurse nutrition can be used, but hiring a wet nurse is not an easy task. An occasional mistake can have a huge impact on the development of the infant, so we must choose carefully.

When choosing a wet nurse, pay attention to the following points: (A) The amount of milk: A wet nurse with too little milk secretion is not suitable, but a wet nurse with too much milk secretion and a young and weak infant is also prone to obstacles. (B) The shape of the breast: Generally, a hemispherical, firm, and beautiful breast is not as rich in milk secretion as a conical, relaxed, and drooping breast. In addition, the shape of the nipple, such as flat, small, recessed, or too large, is not convenient for breastfeeding. (C) The health of the wet nurse's body: Whether she has tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, heart valve disease, neurological diseases, trachoma, infectious skin diseases, etc. It is best to go to a nearby hospital and have a doctor check her. (D) The age of the wet nurse: The age of the wet nurse should not be too old or too young, and 24 to 30 years old is the best. She should also be gentle, mature and stable, and like children. If she is too young, she lacks experience in raising infants, and at the same time, her behavior is frivolous and prone to negligence; if she is too old, her personality is stubborn, she does not accept instructions, and she is easy to arouse people's disgust. (E) The nature of the milk: Usually, those with abundant milk secretion have less fat content and are thinner, while those with less secretion have more fat content and are thicker. Wet nurses within four weeks after childbirth and after eight months are not suitable for employment compared to those with small milk secretion in the most prosperous period.

### Family Maxims

— Fei

Wealthy families often have poor relatives coming and going, which is loyalty and kindness.

Cutting away the thorns in your heart so that people can come and go is the happiest world in the world.

Those who hide their poverty die from poverty, because their desire to win makes them do so. Those who hide their illness die from illness, because their fear obscures them. Those who hide their stupidity die from stupidity, because their infatuation covers them.

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu

Autumn is gradually deepening; the Chinese cabbage is gradually becoming delicious. At seven jiao per catty, it is not cheap, but there is no cheap goods this year. Can you still say it is expensive? Big fish and big meat have become frighteningly expensive. Although Chinese cabbage is expensive, it is still relatively cheaper.
