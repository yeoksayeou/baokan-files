### With Winter Approaching and Harsh Weather, the Eastern Front Turns into Trench Warfare; Soviets Consolidate Defenses Between the Volga and Don Rivers

Berlin, 23rd (Domei News Agency)

According to sources here, the weather on the Eastern Front has been harsh in recent days, especially in the northern and central sectors where muddy roads greatly hinder operations. The Soviet forces are taking advantage of this opportunity to launch repeated counterattacks. However, the German army, having learned from last winter's experience, is well-prepared, and all Soviet counterattacks have been repelled. The Soviet heavy artillery positions on the west bank of the Volga River are quite strong, so the German army seems to lack the absolute confidence to completely occupy the city. Furthermore, the Soviet artillery cover fire in the north has gradually weakened. Fearing that the fall of Stalingrad would allow the German army to launch a major offensive into the area between the Don and Volga rivers, the Soviets are rushing to build strong defensive positions. It seems the Soviet attempt to counterattack has also been abandoned. German authorities claim that due to the severe weather conditions on the front lines, large-scale operations cannot be launched. Only a portion of the German army is advancing on the port of Tuapse despite the harsh weather.

According to *Pravda*, in the last ten days, the German army, with three divisions, has been attacking our Caucasian positions, attempting to reach the Black Sea coast. Fierce battles have taken place on the slopes of the Western Caucasus Mountains and in narrow valleys. Although the German air force has absolute superiority, their losses are still very significant. According to neutral observers, Voronezh is a crucial hub for Soviet military operations in the south. Since the 17th of this month, the Soviets have launched a major offensive, attempting to force the German army to withdraw from the city. However, according to the German side, the German army in Voronezh can only advance once the strength of Timoshenko's forces has been weakened and they no longer have the ability to counterattack. It is said that other battles have largely devolved into trench warfare. The German-Italian forces are likely to hold the positions between the Don and Volga rivers throughout the winter. Once Stalingrad and the Soviet forces in the Don River bend are cleared, the German positions will be secure. Therefore, despite the severe weather in Stalingrad, fierce battles are still ongoing. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army has launched counterattacks near the bend of the Terek River and Melichkov.

### Cloth Merchants Arrested; Market Activities Suspended

Following the arrest of more than 40 cloth merchants the day before yesterday (the 21st), activities in the local cloth market finally came to a standstill yesterday. These merchants were arrested on Wednesday of this week at Building No. 151 Hankou Road, considered the largest speculative market, by detectives from the Central Police Station. Earlier this month, the police station had also arrested more than 300 cloth merchants at the same location, but they were released without any news. It is understood that the police station's arrest was due to reports that the black market had recently revived. On Wednesday morning at 10:00 AM, traffic in the Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road area was temporarily interrupted due to the arrest of these speculators. However, it is not yet known whether the arrested speculators have filed an appeal.

### Zhejiang Local Bank Announces Liquidation; Urges Depositors to Withdraw Funds Before November 20

Zhejiang Local Bank announced yesterday that, upon the order of the Japanese authorities, it is proceeding with liquidation and has begun repaying deposits since October 5. It has been found that many depositors have not yet come to the bank to withdraw their funds. Therefore, it is hereby announced that all depositors should come to the bank to withdraw their funds before November 20 of this year. After this date, payments may no longer be made. Please do not delay. If there are other outstanding matters, please also contact the bank before this date. Please take note. Jiangsu Bank and Yumin Bank have also separately urged the withdrawal of deposits to facilitate closure.

### Promote Circulation of Negotiable Instruments; Abolish Guarantee Endorsements; Clarification of Procedures

In order to promote the smooth circulation of negotiable instruments, the banking industry has proposed the abolition of bank guarantee endorsements on negotiable instruments. The Bankers Association has studied this proposal and submitted a plan to the industry for universal adoption. At the same time, according to Article 68 of the law, the payer is not responsible for verifying the authenticity of the endorsement signature and whether the holder is the actual person, except in cases of fraud or gross negligence. It is generally believed that, except in cases of fraud or gross negligence, the payer is not responsible for verifying the signature of the payee. Within the scope of bank collection of checks, there is no need for guarantee endorsement. Most colleagues have already taken steps to abolish this unnecessary responsibility. Therefore, in this era of numerous banks and frequent negotiable instruments, in order to facilitate the smooth circulation of negotiable instruments, guarantee endorsements should not be restricted too strictly, except for attention to fraud or gross negligence. If there is any impropriety in obstructing the circulation of negotiable instruments, there is the Negotiable Instruments Law to handle according to the law. If there is any doubt at the time of payment, the 13th rule of the industry can be adopted. If there is indeed any doubt, the holder of the instrument can be ordered to provide sufficient proof before payment is made. This would provide convenience for bona fide holders and would also allow the smooth circulation of negotiable instruments in the future. It is reported that each bank has adopted a gradualist approach and is advancing at the appropriate time to achieve the goal of uniform abolition.

### Sale of Unregistered Cigarettes Prohibited

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, a large number of unscrupulous people are selling unregistered cigarettes to various cigarette paper shops (there are four types of unregistered cigarettes: 808, 909, Jin Yang, and Yingxing). Since they are cheap, many cigarette paper shops have been deceived. The authorities have inspected and notified various cigarette paper shops to be careful and will give appropriate punishment to those who sell counterfeit goods. It is reported that the association has stipulated that in the future, all colleagues must notify the cigarette dealer association in advance when selling goods.

### Public Bonds Fall for Three Consecutive Days

Type C Once Broke 60 Yuan Mark

The informal market for public bonds continued to decline yesterday. Although there were still some who were releasing bonds, those who were short selling were actually more numerous. Type C was pressured from four yuan and several jiao to two yuan. Type D fell sharply to more than 57 yuan. Type E even hit 60 yuan. Attempting to create opportunities by force is not suitable for the current environment. Therefore, a short squeeze was created in the market. There were many who borrowed goods to deliver. The market price has fallen for three consecutive days, losing between 4.30 yuan and 5.10 yuan. Yesterday, Type D fell the most, losing more than 2.20 yuan. 96 continued to lose 0.20 yuan. Transactions amounted to approximately 3.45 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------

### Winter Sales of Cotton Cloth Have Begun

Factory Cloth

### Commercial Briefs

Sugar Stocks Still Soft

The single sugar stock of the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office saw few new entries due to a certain rumor, and it did not recover. The coarse sugar stock on the exchange fell again by 1.5 yuan, closing at 295.5 yuan. There were few transactions, and the trend remained weak.

Medium-Sized Glutinous Rice Continues to Rise

Recently, there has been a continuous but small arrival of glutinous rice. With the rise in large glutinous rice, small glutinous rice also improved. Grain stores in the north and south opened dozens of boxes, and the price followed the rise of half a penny.

South Gorgon Fruit Crop Failure

It is reported that there has been a crop failure this year, so the upstream brokers are unwilling to release their stock. The market situation is very tight. The current market price has reached over 1,000. With no new crops arriving soon, it should be available soon.

Miscellaneous Grains Have Vanished

Yesterday, there was still a lack of sporadic arrivals, resulting in a shortage of supply. Most of the small amount of stock was unwilling to be released easily, and the market was tight and lacked transactions. It was also heard that the selling price of national rice in the suburbs was high, with the price of high-quality goods being 455 yuan, medium-quality goods being 430-440 yuan, and inferior goods being 423-420 yuan.

### Mourning the King of Drum Singing, Liu Baoquan

— Sick Pigeon

I was shocked to learn of Liu Baoquan's death in the old capital on the eighth of this month. The bad news spread, and all drum music enthusiasts were deeply saddened. Liu's position in the drum singing world was like that of Tan Xinpei in old opera, earning him the reputation of a "King." He was truly a master artist of his generation.

Baoquan learned Peking Opera at a young age, specializing in old male roles. He once came to Shanghai to perform, earning a good reputation. Later, he studied Beijing-style drum singing under the senior master Wang Qinghe, and his fame soared. He was invited to perform in the imperial court, enjoying the emperor's favor. Baoquan's voice was naturally gifted and remained strong and vibrant until his old age. His high-pitched and powerful voice resonated like the sound of metal and stone. His masterpieces, such as "The Great Western Chamber," "Ning Wu Pass," "Singing the Single Saber," and "Ma'an Li Kui Traps Yu," were unmatched by later performers. His brilliance lay in his unique and profound understanding, mellow tone, and perfectly rounded voice. Each piece had its own distinct emotion, posture, and expression, with each pronunciation being unique. Singing "The Great Western Chamber" was like watching falling flowers and flowing water, with outstanding charm. Singing "Ning Wu Pass" was full of passion and unreservedly refreshing. When hitting the high notes, his voice came from his *dantian* (lower abdomen), bursting forth effortlessly. The depth of his skill can be imagined.

After becoming famous, Liu traveled to various ports, coming to Shanghai no less than three or four times. His last trip south seemed to be around 1936 when his contract with Daluo Tian expired. Later, at the invitation of Xinhua Film Company, he filmed "Ning Wu Pass." The image of the white-haired, crane-aged Liu Baoquan, full of energy and vigor, remains in the minds of our generation. Companies such as Baidai and Gaoting have all recorded Liu's singing, and his records have sold widely. Baoquan had many disciples, but only a few achieved fame. Bai Fengming, Tan Fengyuan, and Xu Feijia were good talents. Lin Hongyu privately admired Baoquan, but even with her achievements, she only acquired about 30-40% of his skill. It appears that the art will soon lack successors, and the authentic sound will be lost. Recalling his original voice, one cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy.

### Visiting Stage Performer Wang Ling

— Zhixing

After watching the performance of "The Widows' Home" by Zhong Zhong (Theater Company), I unexpectedly discovered an excellent new talent, Wang Ling.

She is from Shanghai, seventeen years old this year, and her original name was Wang Yaode. Wang Ling is the stage name given to her by Xia Xia.

"Which school did Miss Wang attend before?" the reporter asked.

"Qingxin Girls' High School."

"Then how did Miss Wang enter the drama world?"

"When I was studying at school, I loved acting. I performed in plays like 'Five Sisters,' etc. This time, due to the introduction of Mr. Li Jianwu, I joined Zhong Zhong as a special performer to play Liu Ruzhen in 'The Widows' Home.' Because this is my first time acting formally, I feel very naive and superficial in all aspects."

It is indeed rare for Miss Wang to have such excellent results in her first stage performance. The writer praised her a few words. "Did Miss Wang start acting as soon as she left school?"

"No, this summer I also worked as a narrator in the puppet paradise performed by Gao Tianlun at the Jewish General Association."

"What new plans do you have after performing in 'The Widows' Home'?"

"I am just a special performer in Zhong Zhong. I have not signed a contract with any theater company, so it is difficult to say whether I will act again after 'The Widows' Home.' I hope to have more opportunities to learn."

Wang Ling played the young widow Liu Ruzhen in "The Widows' Home," showing cuteness, naivety, liveliness, bravery, and decisiveness, which was very well received. However, due to the director and the script, her dialogue and actions were slightly excessive. Otherwise, I believe she would have had even greater success.

She is a very promising newcomer, and if she can be given rigorous training, it will not be difficult for her to embark on the road to success.

### A Study of "Killing the Fishing Family"

— Wuxizhaizhu

Wuxizhaizhu studies the play "Killing the Fishing Family," which is extracted from the "Taking the Fish Tax at Taihu Lake" section of "Later Water Margin." There is no record of this matter in "Former Water Margin" or the "Hui Si Kou" novels. According to the book written by Yan Yan Shanqiao, the author of this "Killing the Fishing Family" script cannot be traced. However, there are differences between the characters in this play and those in "Later Water Margin." Let's not discuss the local tyrant Ding Zixie and the prefect Lu Zhiqiu (actually mistakenly called Lu Ziqiu in the old opera). The name Su En does not exist; only Ruan Xiao Wu exists (some say that the pronunciation of Su En and Xiao Wu is similar, so the so-called Su En may be a mistake for Xiao Wu, which cannot be known). Moreover, Su at this time was the surname of the queen of the foreign country of Siam, whose princess, named Yu Zhi, recruited Hua Fengchun as her consort. Is it then that the so-called Gui Ying in the play is a mistake for Yu Zhi? If so, Yu Zhi was born into the royal family, how could she make a living hunting fish? And Xiao En, as a monarch (or member of the royal family), would he be willing to associate with aquatic people? It is truly a great employment! Those who killed Ding's whole family were Yi Yuyi, Li Jun, and Fei Bao, not Xiao En and his daughter. Although Li Jun and Ni Rong are also mentioned in the play, is this Ni Rong also similar in sound to Fei Bao? This is indeed something to be pondered. Playwrights in the world, when holding the pen, are probably influenced by other stories and thus change their original intentions, which is also unknown.

### Play Review of the Chinese Amateur Theater Society

— Xu Sanmin

The Chinese Amateur Theater Society recently held its second public performance at the Dongxiang Association on the second floor of Pudong, with a program of four one-act plays, which are recorded separately below:

(1) "Reunion" is a light comedy with extraordinary alertness, providing great stimulation to urban youth, gradually making them realize the sins of prosperity and the evil consequences of extravagance. Finally, they bitterly repent and achieve a broken mirror reunited. Xiao Chen's role as Huang Zhenguo is dashing and handsome, with sufficient inner expression. Xun Yi's Hu Ruini is a typical urban young lady, with a romantic and bold character, worthy of being compared to Gu Lan Jun. When she feels that Zhenguo's lover is not her, her awkward expression and disappointed emotions are quite remarkable. Sun Yufang's role, called Zhidan in Peking Opera, cannot be successfully performed without cultivation. Jin Yuqi's performance is seamless and can be called excellent. Qin Fengtai's Zhao Jingli Hao Xiao Zhouqi is probably too deeply imprinted in his image. During his long speech, a vase on the table directly blocked his expression, which is somewhat flawed.

(2) "Infant Slaughter" Human sentiment and law are always in opposition. A child is born and cannot be supported, so he is killed. Because it is better to let him die without knowing it than to have him experience this difficult world. Zhong Zhong's female worker (A Xiao) tells the heartbreaking story of why she killed her child, which is not easy to enter the realm of transformation. Ci Ni's head is wrapped in a floral cloth, dressed as a farmer's woman, with bright eyes and white teeth, and a natural charm. When supporting A Xiao when she faints, her posture, angle, and expression are all appropriate, showing promise. As for the policemen Wen Wu, there is no rice in the bowl when they are eating, and the wine cups are also empty. Doing it casually is like the symbolic style of Peking Opera.

(3) "Dilemma" Du Junqing (played by Ru Xin), her mother (played by Lu Shui) only likes to play mahjong. Her daughter (played by Xiao Xi) slips into the cinema all day long, and the walls are covered with photos of male stars. The mother doesn't understand this stuff and insists that they are wild men. Because of their different personalities, they often quarrel, which increases the family rift. Xiao Hong and Lu Shui's words are so skillful and their actions so realistic in the quarrel that each can be called the red flower and the green leaf.

(4) ??? A one-act opera without a suitable name, so use "?" to replace it. A one-act play containing various songs and tunes from the north and south, including everything. The female lead, Wu Weili, is naturally gifted and is known as Little Golden Voice, and her "Street Moon" is almost indistinguishable from Zhou Xuan. It's a pity that the girl's swordsmanship is not yet at the point where she can perform freely.

In short, this performance was a success. It is indeed commendable to have such achievements with limited conditions.

### Explanation of "Qibu Wentan" (Continued)

— Su Shaoqing

"Huang Jin Jin Lu" is rehearsing "Lü Bu and Diao Chan" and will be staged soon. Cheng Suqiu plays Diao Chan, who is loyal and righteous and does not fail the entrustment of her master. Comparing her to Dong Lü's treachery is more meaningful than spinning cotton in the boudoir. Even if she dances the grass skirt in front of the traitor Zhuo, I dare not be careless. Yu Zhenfei plays Lü Bu, and Ye Shengzhang plays the scout. Both of them will be competent in their roles. "Qibu Wentan" are two sections from the Kunqu opera "Ding Zhi Chunqiu" in the Qing Palace, which I mentioned earlier. Some people may not know this play, so I will briefly explain it.

"Qibu" means the opening scene for Lü Bu. At this time, Lü Bu was under the command of Ding Jianyang, the governor of Bingzhou, and rose up to fight against Dong Zhuo. Lü Bu appears on stage to take command, and Ding Jianyang leads the troops to sing and descend. In "Qian Jin Ji," the overlord first appears on stage, called "Qiba." The meaning of "Qibu" is the same, saying that a certain general first appears. When a general first appears, there are usually various movements such as wearing a helmet and armor, tightening the belt, and kicking the legs, hence the saying "Qi." The word "Qi" has another meaning: opera originated from shadow puppetry. When a shadow puppet is not in use, it is hung behind the stage. When it is used, it is picked up and brought on stage, hence the name "Ju Qi."

"Wentan" means Lü Bu asking the scout about the enemy's situation. This play is before the three battles, when the lords from all walks of life joined forces and stationed in Hulao Pass. The scout detects the enemy's generals and reports the situation to Lü Bu, who asks in detail. In fact, the playwright borrows the scout's tone to exaggerate the enemy's power. This is a common program in Kunqu opera. This play is entirely sung in the northern tune "Zui Hua Yin," which is an important play for a martial clown. Xiao Sheng (young male role) Lü Bu sings a section of "Dian Yi Chun," which is in another key. The rest only夹(jiā) with poetry-like colloquial lines, 要翖(yào xī) the clown does a lot of energetic actions. The martial clown playing the scout has to sing while 做身段(zuò shēn duàn - perform actions), which is also very important. I also heard that "Huang Jin" starts this play from "Cao Cao Offering a Knife." I think "Offering a Knife" should be changed to "Offering a Sword." Kunqu opera is originally "Offering a Sword." Also, in "Catching and Releasing Cao," Cao Cao sings, "I really hope to offer the rich sword to the government and get the results." In the end, whether it is a knife or a sword, the sword should be studied.

### Riding the Storm Together

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Suddenly it was mid-December. One day, when Gong Cuo was having time, it snowed again, and cold winds blew in from every window. Mrs. Ye Er smiled and said to Weicheng, "Tonight is not like last night. The wind will be quieter, and the water in the river will probably freeze." Weicheng, you should have a few drinks with Huanglong, don't drink too much, drinking too much will make you drunk, but drinking a little will make your body warmer." Wei Cheng said, "I was thinking the same thing without Aunt mentioning it. What dishes do we have tonight, Aunt? Are they still the same dishes we had during the day?" Mrs. Ye Er said, "Don't ask now. If you know everything, the taste will be discounted when you eat."

There is nothing to do in the countryside, especially for someone like Huanglong. If there is nothing to do, he can only pass the time by eating and drinking. He said a few words to the yellow dog of the Ye family, and then chased and fought with it again. He ran into the house and put his whole body below the neck in the door, but poked out his face to tease the yellow dog to chase him. Who knew that the yellow dog walked away with its tail wagging. Huanglong scolded, "In the end, it's a dog, not a human being. It doesn't understand what I mean at all. We both have the surname Huang, damn it." Mrs. Ye Er called out from inside, "Huanglong, come and drink! Who are you talking to?" Huanglong walked inside and saw four sets of cups and chopsticks on the table. Weicheng had already taken his seat, so he also sat down and asked, "Are there guests? Where are they?" Mrs. Ye Er said, "It's cold, so we're eating together warmly. There's also me and Cuizhen." Huanglong said, "That's right. I used to think that you were afraid that I would eat too much, so you didn't want to eat with me. I was wronged, eating alone." Cuizhen brought a large plate of drunken crabs. The plate contained salted chicken, kohlrabi, sweet pickled cucumbers, and pickled cabbage. Zhai Zhen smiled, "Brother Huanglong, you're joking again." As she spoke, Mrs. Ye Er and Cuizhen sat down. Huanglong helped Cuizhen and Magpie bring up the dishes. He couldn't hold back his nose, and smiled, "I smell the taste of this drunken crab as if I've eaten the crab. It must be good. Everyone, cheers!" Huanglong just made a circle with his wine glass on the table and was about to bring it to his lips when He Ma brought up a steaming warm silver. (211)
