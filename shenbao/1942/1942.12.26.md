### A Word on Promoting Sino-Japanese Friendship

The call for "Sino-Japanese friendship" has been around for several years, whether from the Japanese or our side. But what has actually been achieved? At least in the minds of the average Chinese people, it cannot be said to be very satisfactory. Even from the Japanese perspective, I am afraid that very few are truly satisfied with the current state of Sino-Japanese "friendship."

Why has "friendship" been spoken of by both China and Japan for several years, yet the actual "friendship" is still in question? This issue is inherently worthy of deep reflection by the people of both countries. Especially today, in the second year of the Greater East Asia War, while the Chinese people's expectations for Japan's assistance in restoring the people's strength and peaceful construction are certainly very urgent, Japan's need for China's manpower and material cooperation to strive for final victory is probably equally pressing. Therefore, how to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation has become the most urgent task for the people of both countries. To demand its realization, one must first review the obstacles on the path of "friendship and cooperation" over the past few years and seek appropriate and comprehensive strategies.

In its editorial on December 9th, this newspaper, regarding General Chief of Staff Kawahara's "Address to Japanese Soldiers in China," made a positive suggestion for promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese military and civilians. However, we believe that in addition to actively promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, improvements on the negative side are equally important. Moreover, only when improvements on the negative side and active efforts are combined can we achieve practical results in the cooperation of friendship between the two countries.

First of all, the reason why past calls for Sino-Japanese friendship have been high, but the actual results have not been satisfactory, lies not in any shortcomings in the political programs and policies of the authorities of both countries, nor in the lack of sincerity of the military and political authorities and people of both countries, but in the insufficient understanding between the people of the two countries or between the officials, civilians, and military personnel of the two countries. Although both sides strongly advocate friendship, insufficient understanding often leads to discrepancies between reality and their respective desires. The main obstacles to mutual understanding are the language barrier and the differences in customs, habits, and daily life. Therefore, today, if we do not seek friendship and cooperation, then we must eliminate these obstacles. Recently, in China, Japanese language schools have been established one after another, and generally, schools above the middle school level are gradually trending towards making Japanese a required subject. If Japanese language and culture are made more popular among the Chinese people, it may create excellent results for the future of Sino-Japanese friendship. However, on the other hand, we hope even more that the Japanese authorities, at least for Japanese personnel coming to work in China, must first ensure that they fully understand the Chinese language, customs, and habits, and establish Chinese language schools domestically to train specialized personnel. On the one hand, Chinese language specialty schools should be immediately established in China for Japanese personnel working in China, providing them with the necessary knowledge. In the future, all Japanese personnel working in China should be able to interact directly with our people as if they were compatriots. We believe that this matter is of great significance in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship.

Secondly, Japan has historically been a land of etiquette and righteousness, admired by the world. At the same time, Japan is a country ruled by law, a modern country ruled by law, and every Japanese citizen has a modern spirit of the rule of law. Therefore, despite years of war, the domestic order is well-maintained, which is also admired by the world. Although we Chinese uphold the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and also regard ourselves as a land of etiquette and righteousness, we have been under the oppression of feudal autocracy for years. The people struggle on the line of death, only feeling that the rulers are our enemies, no longer knowing etiquette and righteousness; while the rulers only know how to deceive the world in the name of etiquette and righteousness. As for the spirit of the rule of law, even the written words of the law have been reduced to nothing, and those with power arbitrarily trample on it, thus deepening the national tendency to despise the law. The decline of national power is partly due to this. And the lack of understanding of friendly Japan in recent years may also have its roots here. Therefore, we hope that our people will learn the Japanese people's respect for etiquette and the spirit of the rule of law, and we even more expect the Japanese government and people, especially the Japanese military, political, and constitutional personnel working in China, to demonstrate the unique Japanese spirit of respect for etiquette, righteousness, and the rule of law in front of the Chinese people. When dealing with the Chinese people, no matter what level of person the other party is, they should especially show their politeness and respect for the Chinese people's personality, so that the Chinese people naturally develop a concept of affection and respect for the Japanese people, and avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. This will also make a significant contribution to Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation.

In short, in the past, due to the language and customs barriers between the two sides, and the lack of respect for etiquette and the spirit of the rule of law, misunderstandings in small incidents often led to misunderstandings between the Chinese and Japanese people, forming many obstacles on the path of Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation. Today, in order to achieve China's peaceful construction and the victory of the Greater East Asia War, we must eliminate these obstacles thoroughly. We especially expect Japanese personnel working in China to demonstrate a model spirit in front of the Chinese people, pay attention to politeness, and abide by the law. Even for a small number of unruly individuals, they should be warned with a compassionate mindset, as if dealing with errant children, and in attitude, there should be absolutely no concept of the superiority of one's own nation. Moreover, there should be a great spirit of "not dwelling on the past" in order to seek a new beginning together. Only in this way can we more effectively promote friendship and cooperation. In addition to urgently awakening our people to be vigilant, we cannot help but more enthusiastically expect our friends to make further efforts in this regard.

### Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces: Air Battle at Oshima Island, Four American Planes Shot Down, Six Damaged

Tokyo, 25th (Domei) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM today that on the night of December 23rd, the Imperial Garrison on Oshima Island engaged with over ten enemy B-17 aircraft that raided from the direction of Midway Island. Four enemy aircraft were shot down, and the rest were repelled. Six others were damaged. Japanese losses included one death, four injuries, and small fires broke out in four locations. No other damage occurred.

Lisbon, 24th (Domei) – According to Melbourne reports, Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced today that the Australian minesweeper "Armidale" (900 tons) has been sunk near Timor Island. Thirty crew members are still missing.

Tokyo, 25th (Domei) – Individuals close to the Imperial Navy today criticized the American aircraft raid on Oshima Island (formerly Wake Island), stating that the heavily damaged American aircraft should once again demonstrate to the United States the tragic consequences of fighting Japan anywhere. The aircraft, which launched from Midway Island, lost nearly half of their number, and the remaining aircraft were also severely battered and escaped. It is doubtful whether the damaged American aircraft can return to their base after traveling 1,100 miles. The American aircraft that raided were the "Flying Fortresses" boasted by the United States. Now that they have been heavily battered by the Japanese Navy, the United States should reconsider its exaggerated claims regarding the flight capabilities of these aircraft. When the American aircraft raided, they blindly dropped bombs and fled in disarray after being hit by the Japanese. The United States should remember that Japan is prepared to deal with all counterattacks against its occupied territories.

### Wang Jingwei, Concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, Delivers Radio Address in Japan: States that China and Japan Working Together Will Surely Establish the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – Since his arrival in Japan on the 21st, Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, has been warmly welcomed by the Japanese government and people. At 7:30 PM on the 25th, Chairman Wang specifically delivered a radio address at the Guest House titled "To the Japanese People," which was broadcast throughout Japan by the local radio station. He strongly stated that with China and Japan working together, the Greater East Asia War will surely achieve final victory, and the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will also achieve complete success as a result. The original text of the speech is recorded below:

Dear people of the friendly nation, I was in Tokyo last June, able to meet with the dear people of the friendly nation, and able to convey a little of my sincerity to your ears through the broadcast. Now, a year and a half later, I am able to meet with you again here, and convey a little of my sincerity again. I really have indescribable emotion and joy. I remember last June, here I received the courteous hospitality of the Imperial Household, the sincere meeting with the government, and the deep sympathy and fervent expectations given by the people. This is really unforgettable for me. Now, a year and a half later, I am here again. On the 22nd, I paid a visit to His Majesty the Emperor, respectfully listened to his edict, and received his earnest instructions on Sino-Japanese friendship and the construction of Greater East Asia, and was awarded the world's most glorious medal. The gratitude in my heart is beyond words. Government officials, amidst their busy duties, spared valuable time to discuss important issues concerning the current situation and indicated a future of unlimited brightness. The sympathy and expectations of the people for me have become even more cordial and concerned, filling me with excitement, wondering how I can live up to the profound friendship of the friendly nation.

I remember on June 25th last year, I gave a speech in Osaka before leaving your country's borders, titled "Returning to Our Original Face." I pointed out that during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, the general Chinese sentiment favored your country, eagerly hoping for your country's victory, healing the wounds of the war between our two countries forty-eight years ago, and returning to the original face of our two countries as brothers. From this, it can be seen that the friendly relationship between our two countries is natural and inherent. Even if it is interrupted by temporary disputes, the concept of sharing weal and woe still exists and can still emerge at any time. Therefore, I dare to assert that it is necessary and possible for our two countries to work together to revive East Asia. When I said these words, I did not expect that in less than six months, the Greater East Asia War would break out. Upon receiving the notification of the friendly nation Japan's declaration of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately unanimously resolved to share weal and woe with the friendly nation Japan. This is China's complete return to its original face, to work together with the friendly nation Japan to revive East Asia. I believe that from now on, the degree of friendship will only improve day by day. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of our country, will surely be able to fully realize his Pan-Asianism, and the construction of a new East Asia order based on morality, as advocated by your country, will surely be completely successful. Since issuing the statement on December 8th last year that China and the friendly nation Japan share weal and woe, I have been thinking day and night about how to make the statement a reality. Therefore, I launched the New National Movement. The meaning of the New National Movement is to mobilize the spirit of the entire nation to engage in cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, to make the entire nation aware that China's liberation must be sought in the victory of the Greater East Asia War, to make the entire nation aware that it is necessary to strengthen national power and people's strength to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War in order to achieve victory. Based on this meaning, in order to train all officers, I established an officer training corps in the capital, divided into four terms. All officers nationwide, regardless of how busy their duties are, come in batches. In addition to learning various necessary military courses, I myself am responsible for spiritual training. Now the third term is over, and only the fourth term is left. All officers nationwide will not have undergone retraining. The purpose of retraining is to thoroughly understand the necessity of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War and the efforts that should be made. In addition, young people in various schools and young people outside of schools, especially diligent young people, are also retrained. In addition to enthusiastically attending classes during the summer vacation, they are also given practical service to cultivate their habit of hard work and endurance. I dare not say what achievements can be made, but the people under the rule of the National Government do understand the meaning of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. Everyone is willing to be a believer in Pan-Asianism, everyone is willing to be a companion of the friendly nation's officers and soldiers and people, and work together for the Greater East Asia War.

But the most regrettable thing is the attitude of Chongqing. They have not yet shown any signs of awakening. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, they were willing to be East Asian traitors. They participated in the Anglo-American front. They even signed treaties with the United Kingdom and the United States not to make peace alone. They were willing to serve the United Kingdom and the United States to restrain your country's strength used in the Greater East Asia War. They also harbored hatred for the National Government's determination to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. They constantly destroy and hinder the plans for security protection and economic improvement. We are truly heartbroken for these East Asian traitors. Therefore, we feel that the National Government can only declare its determination and position as an East Asian comrade, so that all the people can unite their minds and coordinate their steps to break the Anglo-American policy of alienating East Asia, and at the same time promote the collapse of East Asian traitors. For seven years, your country's officers and soldiers have been loyal and brave, establishing great merit on the front lines of defending East Asia, adding infinite glory to East Asia. The people of your country are calm and brave in the war, each doing their best in their positions. This is what I extremely admire. Coming here again this time, seeing with my own eyes and hearing with my own ears that the training of the people is becoming more and more strengthened, the production, adjustment, saving, and economy of resources are becoming more and more thorough, and in the midst of successive victories, the spirit of courage, diligence, hard work, and endurance has increased without limit. This makes me feel endless excitement in addition to admiration. I think that the coming year will be the year when your country ensures the great victories that have continued to be gained since the Greater East Asia War, and it will also be the year when your country continues to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War and brings it to completion. Since last year, although China has been able to contribute at least minimally to the Greater East Asia War and benefit your country due to years of decline, the psychological construction and the construction of military economy are all focused on the point of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. In psychology, by transforming the past anti-Japanese war ideology, establishing the idea of Sino-Japanese mutual affection and common defense of East Asia, it has basically matured. Recently, we have also made efforts to promote the exchange of ideas between the people of the two countries, to unite the East Asian nations to become East Asian comrades, to jointly devote ourselves to the cause of East Asian co-prosperity. The military policy is to establish a sound army to protect the rear, so that the friendly soldiers can reduce their worries and can take a share of the suffering in the battlefront. The economic policy is to find out how to share the cost of the Greater East Asia War, train the people to carry out the spirit of perseverance and hard work, engage in increasing production and adjusting distribution, and save on consumption, so as to bear a small share of the responsibility of East Asia. In short, the colleagues of the National Government and the people they lead have united as one, determined to work with the friendly nation Japan to share weal and woe, and firmly believe that by uniting East Asian nations as East Asian comrades, the Greater East Asia War will achieve final victory, and the construction of Greater East Asia will be completely successful. Today, I share a little of my sincerity with the dear people of the friendly nation. I hope that you will accept it and work together.

### Sawada and Decoux Hold Second Meeting

Saigon, 25th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Sawada visited Governor-General Decoux again at 9:00 AM on the 24th and continued to hold a long discussion for two and a half hours. The first meeting on the 14th involved an exchange of general opinions. This second meeting seems to be specifically discussing the issue of tightening the basic political relations between Japan and Vietnam. During this meeting, Ambassador Sawada will express that the Vietnamese side has decided in principle to actively cooperate after these two meetings, so there is great hope for its satisfactory completion.

Saigon, 24th (Domei) – Japanese Ambassador to French Indochina Sawada told reporters this morning after a second meeting with Vietnamese Governor Decoux that the Japan-Vietnam negotiations have become concrete in today's talks, but the contents of the talks are not yet ready to be disclosed. What can be guaranteed is that the meeting is making satisfactory progress, and the negotiations between the two sides are proceeding in an "extremely friendly attitude." The initial meeting mainly discussed general issues regarding Japan's economic and political relations, and next year's economic agreement is also among them. Ambassador Sawada stated that he will soon depart for Tokyo, and the details of the negotiations will be discussed by officials of the Japanese Embassy office.

### Conference of Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls in China: Striving to Implement "Action First" and Actively Promoting Policies Towards China

Translated from the December 18th "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" – The first Conference of Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls in China since the establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia was held in Nanjing over two days starting on the 17th. At the conference, regarding the policies towards China that the Ministry of Greater East Asia must strive to implement, a comprehensive review was made of the various policies of the past. Not only that, but regarding effective and appropriate strategies for dealing with the current new world situation, local ambassadors and consuls-general also exchanged opinions without reservation. As a result, not only have the various policies towards China that had been stagnating been actively promoted, but also the strengthening of the National Government and the tightening of Sino-Japanese relations have seen leaping development. Therefore, all parties have great expectations for this conference.

Although there is still no change in our policy towards China due to the establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, in response to the call of the Greater East Asia War, we must earnestly implement the work of nurturing and strengthening the National Government, and make the territory under the rule of the National Government a base for the great rear, as Chairman Wang has called it. At the same time, the National Government must quickly gain a favorable position in grasping the hearts of the people. Regarding these two points, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the opinions of China and Japan have already tended towards agreement, but when it comes to concrete implementation, there is still a feeling of scratching an itch from outside one's boots. In order to strengthen the National Government as a base in the rear and its system of sharing weal and woe, the following three decisions have been made:

(1) Expanding the scope of the National Government's burden in terms of industrial and economic burden;

(2) Reconfirming the particularity of the National Government's political operation;

(3) Fundamental cooperation from the Japanese side in the implementation of the National Government's decisive battle system.

The above three points, as already stated in the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty," are already unchangeable national policies, and there is no need for us to make further comments here. However, regarding how to promote the power of the National Government in the execution of our war, there still seems to be a lack of clear and concrete regulations. When we consider these points, we think of the following:

(1) While we are concentrating all our efforts on actual combat operations, the National Government must undertake the greatest sacrifice and take on political and economic policies.

(2) In a long-term war, politics and economy must be placed under absolute control, but up to this point, the policies of the National Government are still liberal.

(3) If the political power of the National Government does not penetrate to the very end, permeate everything, it cannot be expected to develop rapidly and clearly.

To what extent has the National Government itself reflected on the above points? What kind of countermeasures have been adopted? Although Sino-Japanese relations have been linked together like an iron wall due to the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty" and Chairman Wang's advocacy of sharing weal and woe, in this situation, the relationship between China and Japan is just like the relationship between Japan, Thailand, and Annam. Whether they have actually and formally reached the point of sharing weal and woe is still worth considering. For the National Government, which is still in its infancy, it must have great determination and vision. As of today, it is not enough to merely wait for the strengthening of the National Government's political power. On this point, Japan must guide and strengthen it with considerable determination. Several points that remained as pending issues in the past:

(1) Re-examine the current state of the economy and industry, and dramatically strengthen the National Government's economic position.

(2) Provide appropriate guidance for the National Government's political operation, thereby invigorating its self-reliance.

(3) Promote and assist in the implementation of its decisive battle system.

If these points can be guided appropriately, there is no doubt that the power of the National Government will increase, and at that time, the energy spent by the Japanese side can be transferred to other places. With the establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, these issues have been seriously discussed in the local army and various agencies. Now, it is said that opinions have been completely unified. At this conference of ambassadors and consuls in China, the intentions of the local area will naturally be reflected more concretely. Especially on the second day of the conference, all attendees below Shigemitsu, and all the general staff officers below Commander-in-Chief Hata, exchanged opinions without barriers. Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to regard this conference as the final conclusion of the local agencies in China on this issue. Taking this conference as an opportunity, it is hoped that the implementation of Sino-Japanese relations and the National Government's decisive battle system will have leaping development. It is especially hoped that the policies towards China that have always been regarded as mere theoretical discussions will immediately be transformed into a policy of "action first." In parallel with this, it is also hoped that the National Government will make great efforts to make corresponding preparations. (Translated by Qian Mu)

### The Assassination of the French North African Leader Darlan; General Giraud Takes Over; Young Assassin Captured on the Spot

Allied Press, Argentina Capital, 25th Dispatch: San Francisco Radio Station broadcasted today that Admiral Darlan had been assassinated in Algiers. According to Algiers Radio, General Giraud has taken over the task of maintaining security in French North Africa. It is reported that Darlan was assassinated in front of his office in Algiers. He was rushed to the hospital but died en route. A young suspect has been arrested and his nationality is under investigation. The San Francisco broadcast also stated that Darlan was assassinated at 2 PM on Thursday when he was going to his office. The young man who opened fire was captured on the spot.

Allied Press, Lisbon, 25th Dispatch: Algiers broadcasted the details of Darlan's assassination as follows: On the afternoon of the 24th, at 2 PM, Darlan, escorted by a guard, arrived by car at the Commissioner's Office. As he passed through the main hall, a young man suddenly jumped out from the side of the reception room, holding a pistol. He fired several shots at Darlan. It turned out that the young man had visited the Commissioner's Office before Darlan's arrival, but did not request to see Darlan. Unexpectedly, he hid in the side of the reception room, waiting for an opportunity to snipe. As soon as Darlan arrived, the young man suddenly opened fire. The first shot hit the second rib on the right side, piercing the chest. Although Darlan had been hit in a vital spot, he still tried to evade the assassin and ran into the chairman's office, but eventually collapsed from exhaustion. Although Darlan's guard tried to capture the assassin, he was hit by two bullets in the middle. The assassin took the opportunity to escape outwards, but at that moment, another guard rushed over and shot the assassin in the ear, and he was captured. Although Darlan was immediately sent to the hospital, he died en route due to his injuries. The assassin is a 23-year-old young man, and the weapon he used was a .25 caliber automatic pistol.

United Press, Dalian, 29th Dispatch: Algiers announced this morning the details of the assassination of Admiral Darlan, the High Commissioner of French North Africa, as follows: Darlan was assassinated in his office in Algiers. The assassin had arrived at the High Commissioner's Office yesterday afternoon, requesting to see Darlan. He waited in the anteroom of the Commissioner's Office.

Officials in the office heard the sound and rushed over. The assassin was arrested on the spot. Darlan was rushed to the hospital, but he died en route. An official who stepped forward to capture the assassin was shot in the leg.

Allied Press, Argentina Capital, 25th Dispatch: According to news from Washington today, President Roosevelt has strongly condemned the assassin of Darlan, the leader of the French rebels in Algiers, saying, "The assassination of Admiral Darlan is a heinous crime. I hope that the assassin of Admiral Darlan will be swiftly brought to justice."

United Press, Tangier, 25th Dispatch: News from Algiers stated that after Darlan's assassination, General Eisenhower, the commander of the U.S. forces in North Africa, ordered a ban on the dissemination of the news. Therefore, the announcement was delayed by ten hours. The assassin was arrested on the spot and handed over to the U.S. military authorities for interrogation. The confession is being kept strictly secret and his name has not been announced.

United Press, Lisbon, 25th Dispatch: The Washington Intelligence Agency, based on information from the Allied Headquarters in North Africa, released shocking news this morning, stating that Admiral Darlan was assassinated by a 20-year-old Frenchman.

Meeting to Discuss the Political Situation and Urge the People to Remain Calm

Allied Press, Bern, 25th Dispatch: Algiers Radio announced today that the French National Assembly of North Africa (the organ of the Darlan-faction rebel French government) will meet in Algiers tomorrow to consider the political issues arising from Darlan's death.

Now General Giraud, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief, has assumed the responsibility of maintaining order. Any attempt to create division will be suppressed and will not be tolerated."

### Retrospective of Darlan's Political Activities

United Press, Berlin, 25th Dispatch: Shortly after the last World War, Darlan began to participate in political life. In addition to serving as Minister of the Navy, he represented France in London and Geneva, attending meetings as a naval expert. Darlan repeatedly argued that France needed to develop its navy and insisted that France's navy must be stronger than any country on the European continent. In 1937, he became Chief of Staff of the French Navy, which gave him the opportunity to implement his naval expansion plan. As a result, French warships had modern equipment when they entered the war. In July 1939, Darlan was promoted to Admiral, the first person in French naval history to hold this rank. After France was defeated in July 1940, Pétain formed a new cabinet, and Darlan concurrently served as Minister of the Army and Navy. On July 4, 1941, Darlan was given command of French military affairs, along with Darlan, Huntziger, and Flandin, but Darlan was the mastermind among the three. In February, the French government issued an order appointing Darlan as the successor to French Head of State Pétain. When Laval came to power in April, Darlan remained on the political stage, serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, reporting directly to Pétain. A few days before the Allied forces invaded French North Africa, Darlan set off for Algiers. It was rumored that he was captured by the U.S. military there. Shortly after, Reuters reported that a U.S. general treated Darlan as a guest. On November 12, Darlan urged French generals in North Africa not to resist the invading Allied forces. Since this month, Darlan has been the Head of State of French North Africa, concurrently commanding the fire power of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force. He also organized administrative institutions, attempting to be recognized as the independent French government of North Africa. Finally, due to the divergence of opinions between Britain and the United States on Darlan's position, Darlan admitted that he was only exercising his powers on behalf of France in French North Africa during the war.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 25th Dispatch: Darlan was born in 1881 and began serving in the French Navy in 1899. In 1936, he was promoted to Chief of Naval Operations. After the German-French armistice agreement was concluded, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. In 1941, he was designated as Pétain's successor. When U.S. forces invaded French North Africa, he colluded with the U.S. military, violated Pétain's order to resist, and concluded a ceasefire agreement with the U.S. military without authorization, openly betraying his country. On November 27, he was dismissed from his post and stripped of his citizenship by Marshal Pétain.

### Vichy's Silence

Allied Press, Vichy, 25th Dispatch: Today, officials here have not commented on Darlan's assassination. General Pétain and Laval have also refused to issue any official statements.

### Axis Forces in Tunisia Reinforce and Launch Offensive; Rumors of U.S. Landings in Dakar

Allied Press, Lisbon, 25th Dispatch: According to news received here, the Anti-Axis Forces Command announced on the 24th that the Axis forces had launched an offensive west of Kairouan in central Tunisia, attacking the French rebel forces under Giraud. The Anti-Axis Forces pointed out that the German Commander, Nehring, had taken preemptive action with the aim of expanding the Axis forces' river crossing points before the British forces under Eisenhower could move. In the past few weeks, a large number of troops have been transported across the Mediterranean by sea and air, so it is quite possible to launch a major offensive. It is expected that this counter-offensive by the Axis forces west of Kairouan may be the beginning of a major offensive.

United Press, Berlin, 25th Dispatch: Military sources stated yesterday that U.S. forces in Tunisia launched a small-scale offensive north of Medjez el Bab, and 100 were captured by German and Italian forces. U.S. raiding parties were also defeated southwest of Mateur. Allied forces in Cyrenaica are only engaged in reconnaissance activities.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 25th Dispatch: According to Algiers Radio on the 24th, it is rumored that several units of U.S. forces, composed of air force supply and special service units, have landed in Dakar.

Allied Press, Lisbon, 25th Dispatch: Axis forces in Tunisia have achieved local victories in several places, thwarting the enemy's attempts to recover territory lost a few days ago, and capturing 200 enemy soldiers. Last night, German bombers heavily attacked port facilities in Benghazi and an enemy air base on the Libyan coast. At the same time, eight enemy aircraft were shot down over the English Channel along the Dutch coast. British aircraft repeatedly attacked western Germany all night, causing significant damage.

### Spain-Portugal Alliance; British Suspicion

United Press, Berlin, 24th Dispatch: German political reports stated that the conclusion of the Spain-Portugal bloc has aroused some negative comments in Britain. Reuters initially believed that it was beneficial to Britain and immediately congratulated the Spanish and Portuguese politicians. However, when news came from Lisbon that the "Iberian Bloc" was leaning towards a new Europe, it became very disturbed. The News Chronicle raised the question of what the purpose of this bloc was. The Spanish Falange Party hates Britain, and the new Spanish political system is similar to that of Germany and Italy. Therefore, the News Chronicle expressed suspicion of the bloc. Furthermore, Britain's traditional policy is to oppose the formation of blocs of European countries. Britain's only hope for Europe is to be divided into several small countries. The British are most envious of the unification of Europe completed by the Axis powers today. Therefore, at the Versailles Conference, they opposed the union of Austria-Hungary, opposed the formation of a Balkan bloc, supported Belgium against the Netherlands, and supported Belgium and the Netherlands against France. The same is true in Northern Europe. Britain supports Norway's separation from Sweden. In the past few years, Britain has also prevented Sweden and Finland from forming an alliance. Sweden's wait-and-see attitude is also the result of British influence. Switzerland's separation is also supported by Britain. For many years, Britain's policy has been to oppose Austria's merger with Germany. It is also afraid of the three Baltic states uniting to resist the Soviet Union. Therefore, the alliance between Spain and Portugal is naturally a thorn in Britain's side. The only purpose of the 200-year alliance between Britain and Portugal is to prevent the two countries from taking concerted action. In any case, Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana's trip to Lisbon is a milestone in the journey to complete European unity.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Don Region; Soviet Counter-Attacks Repelled

Allied Press, Lisbon, 25th Dispatch: The fighting in the Don region of the Soviet Union continues fiercely. The German High Command announced that the Axis forces have repelled repeated strong counter-attacks by the Soviet forces, severely damaging Red Army units. German forces in the Terek region and the Kalmyk Steppe have been successful in defensive battles, repelling Soviet attacks and repeatedly launching successful swift strikes. Southeast of Lake Ilmen, Soviet forces launched another attack, but the German forces held the line. In this area, 34 Soviet tanks were destroyed. On December 23, German troops in the Leningrad region successfully launched several attacks, destroying several Soviet trenches. On the night of the 22nd, German troops used flamethrowers and demolition charges to break through Soviet minefields and barbed wire, destroying large sections of Soviet trench lines and capturing several Soviet soldiers.

United Press, Berlin, 25th Dispatch: Soviet forces launched a large-scale offensive in the central Don region, but German forces resisted strongly, often occupying hedgehog positions ahead of the Soviet spearhead, preventing the Soviet forces from using their heavy weapons and severely disrupting their supply units, causing the Soviet offensive to be transformed into localized small-scale battles. In another incident, a German armored vehicle unit was attacked by Soviet forces while disembarking from a train. German anti-aircraft gun units immediately opened fire to prevent the enemy from advancing, allowing the German troops to complete the disembarkation. The German troops then broke into the enemy's rear, capturing the commander and all the staff officers of a certain Soviet army.

### Christmas Eve on the Front Lines

United Press, Berlin, 25th Dispatch: A correspondent from the German tank unit on the Eastern Front, Elmscott, reported that on Christmas Eve, while the soldiers of the unit were lighting Christmas trees and celebrating together, the commander suddenly read out a frontline report that enemy tanks and infantry were approaching in formation. They prepared to meet the enemy. A soldier interjected, saying that the enemy's attack was purely malicious, with no military purpose, simply to spoil their Christmas Eve celebration. At that time, the sound of gunfire and artillery had already begun to be heard around them. The soldiers of the unit remained extremely calm, raised their glasses, and drank heartily. After a while, they jumped out of their hiding places and launched a head-on attack on the approaching enemy forces. Thus, the Battle of Christmas Eve began. The German troops advanced bravely, entering a certain village. The enemy forces immediately collapsed. The German troops then occupied a village house. Soon, an artilleryman moved a Christmas tree over, and they relit the Christmas tree and continued the unfinished celebrations.

### From Darkness to Light; Five Stages to Follow; Pope's Christmas Message

United Press, Vatican City, 25th Dispatch: Pope Pius XII delivered a radio address yesterday afternoon, stating that the balanced order between nations is related to the degree of material, social, and cultural balance within each nation. There is no stable front of peace within a country, nor can there be a front of peace outside the country. Only comprehensive peace, both domestically and internationally, can save the people from the disasters of war, and overcome new material and spiritual disputes. Social order must be based on ethics, not just on economic or political foundations. Employed persons have the right to obtain a portion of the property they are entitled to and should not be enslaved economically by the state or individuals. If the time for repentance has arrived, then it is time to awaken the reason of the world immersed in fantasy. This is the work that Catholics should engage in. The path from darkness to light must be very long. The most important thing is to take the first step on that path. This path can be divided into five important stages: (1) Guarantee human rights, (2) Eliminate materialism, (3) Restore the sanctity of work, (4) Ensure the security of the law, (5) Practice the spirit of Christ, and serving the masses is the highest and most sacred work.

### Goebbels Urges German Soldiers and Civilians to Endure Hardship and Achieve Their Goals

United Press, Berlin, 25th Dispatch: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a radio address last night on Christmas Eve, on behalf of the Führer, extending Christmas greetings to soldiers on the front lines, people in the rear, and Germans around the world. He stated that this Christmas season, German soldiers and civilians are either sitting around the Christmas tree at home, gathering together, or fighting soldiers are spending this holiday in the trenches. Prisoners of war and detainees are abroad. Although the circumstances are different, everyone's belief is the same, that is, Germany's bright future and the victorious end to the war. Although the sacrifices are heavy, the foundation of the nation will be laid from this. As we celebrate this wartime Christmas of 1942, I would like to share this sentiment with the people of the country. Although the war is arduous, when we think of the great purpose of this campaign, we will not feel the hardship. It is hoped that the soldiers and civilians in the front and rear will encourage each other. The Führer has outstanding military talent and is assisted by loyal and brave soldiers, all serving the country, not hesitating to sacrifice their lives, with one heart and one mind, seeking the welfare and security of the nation. Their achievements will last for ten thousand ages and will not decay. Tonight, Christmas trees across the country are dazzling, as if symbolizing the bright future of Germany. On this festive occasion, I would like to echo the Führer's words: "Before God and the soldiers and civilians of the nation, we must reaffirm that we will fight for the welfare of our people and the betterment of humanity until final victory." We celebrate together with the people of the country.

### Japanese Information Bureau Spokesperson Talks on Christmas

Allied Press, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch: Information Bureau spokesperson Hori said on the eve of Christmas that this year's Christmas is a cold and joyless holiday, spent in the flames of war and blind hatred imposed on the people by Britain and the United States. Christmas is a holiday commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, but this year is different, not in its essence, but in the attitude of remembrance. Countless fathers, sons, and husbands cannot be reunited with their mothers, daughters, wives, and sisters to celebrate together. They are either fighting in the deserts, jungles, seas, and skies, or have long been sleeping in foreign sands. This kind of world turmoil is all imposed on the people of the world by the United States and Britain. These two countries claim to follow Christian principles, but their irresponsible leaders do not practice what they preach, betraying the trust of their people. They only know their own welfare, and they are willing to sacrifice others. They are blind to the sincerity of other people in improving their living conditions, and they now blame others for their own faults. The purpose of our war is to build a world of universal love and brotherhood, without allowing any hypocrisy. Only by eliminating the ambition of the United States and Britain to dominate the world and establishing a new world order based on the highest ideals of humanity can the Christian people of the world celebrate a truly joyous Christmas.

### Capital Volunteer Police to be Reviewed on New Year's Day

### One Year Since the Fall of Hong Kong; Isoya Pledges His Beliefs; Reconstruction Plans Will be Implemented

Allied Press, Hong Kong, 24th Dispatch: Lieutenant General Isoya, the Governor of Hong Kong, stated on the anniversary of the fall of Hong Kong that Hong Kong has entered the first stage of its reconstruction as an Asian city since breaking free from the shackles of the British. This is a matter of great significance and inspiring for the people of East Asia. All plans for the reconstruction of Hong Kong will be implemented, so that the city can make a direct and indirect contribution to the smooth progress of the war, which goes without saying. In addition, plans are now being drawn up to develop Hong Kong into an important center of shipping, economy, and culture in East Asia. In terms of military and political administration in this region, Hong Kong should become a model for national cooperation and accelerating the universal peace between China and Japan. The achievements of the past year have completely eliminated British military, political, and economic interests in Hong Kong. The people of East Asia should understand that this is a major mission that East Asians must fulfill: to remove material concepts and awaken the spirit of the East. The future of Hong Kong is full of hope, but we should not be overly optimistic until we have achieved final victory. The people of Hong Kong should be prepared to endure hardships and strive to bring the current war to a satisfactory conclusion.

### Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Discusses Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation; Cooperation System to Focus on Central China; Chinese Should Participate in Production Enterprises as Much as Possible

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch: Regarding Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the Asahi Shimbun editorial on the 25th, entitled "New Developments in Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation," provided a detailed commentary. In addition to explaining the relationship between Sino-Japanese cooperation and strengthening the National Government, it also strongly advocated that Japan should once again correct its long-held views to regulate the relations between the two countries, generally stating: We firmly believe that the relationship of Sino-Japanese cooperation will become even closer as a result of the visit to Japan by Chairman Wang, concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan of the National Government. The enhancement of Sino-Japanese cooperation and the strengthening of the National Government are inseparable. Since the National Government cannot be strengthened, it is impossible to seek the enhancement of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Therefore, it is natural that measures to strengthen the National Government should include Sino-Japanese cooperation. The core of Sino-Japanese relations lies in how to make the economic cooperation between the two countries closer, so as to further improve the acquisition and increase in production. Therefore, future policies must be based on this purpose to seek its concrete realization. Recently, it has been reported that the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation system will focus on Central China. From a general perspective, it has been greatly improved, that is, apart from what is absolutely necessary for the operations of the Japanese army, Chinese capital and Chinese personnel should be allowed to participate in or be fully responsible for the operation of anything directly related to Chinese people's livelihood. The various state-owned companies under the Central China Development Company should also be improved based on this principle. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, most of the military-managed factories have been returned to Chinese factory owners. However, a review should be conducted on new and old enemy properties at this time, and then dealt with in accordance with the aforementioned principles to improve people's livelihood, and the National Government can also achieve the purpose of strengthening and increasing production. Today, the Sino-Japanese relationship has progressed from sharing joys and sorrows to sharing life and death. Therefore, the Chinese side will certainly further cooperate to complete the Greater East Asia War. However, it is necessary for our country to correct its long-held views based on a truly Mahayana perspective to regulate the relations between the two countries.

### Zhou Zuoren Publishes New Year's Reflections

Central News Agency, Beijing, 25th Dispatch: Time passes quickly, and the year is drawing to a close and the new year is coming. Zhou Zuoren, the Supervisor of the North China Education Department, specially published an article entitled "New Year's Reflections." The excerpt is recorded below: Recalling the past year, the world has been in the midst of storms and dangerous waves. However, our East Asian nations still resolutely overcome all difficulties and move towards the road of liberating East Asia and revitalizing East Asia. Because the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is extremely bright and righteous, it will surely achieve final victory. What we should pay attention to at this time lies in the construction work in the future. Although war is a destructive work, it is also a construction work at the same time. If the corrupt old order is not destroyed, it will be impossible to build a correct and solid new order. Therefore, all past obstacles must be thoroughly destroyed. Today, the most important thing for us to do is to conduct a thorough review of how to carry out post-war construction and how to revitalize East Asia. The content of the construction work is actually very complicated. In short, it can be divided into two types: tangible construction and intangible construction. The former is military, economic, etc., while the latter is spiritual construction, that is, construction in terms of culture and thought. The importance of these two is actually not different, and they must be carried out in concert to achieve a satisfactory result. The complexity and difficulty of the Greater East Asia construction at the present stage should not be entrusted to only a part of the people, but must be jointly shouldered by all East Asian nations. As the saying goes, "sailing in the same boat in the wind and rain," which can be a true depiction of the current situation in Greater East Asia. As the old year is coming to an end and the new year is approaching, we should further strengthen our will and work hard in the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows to consolidate the foundation of East Asian nations and achieve future happiness, and establish lasting peace in East Asia.

The company's organization has also been reformed, and the editorial center of the newspaper, which was located in Osaka, has been decided to be moved to Tokyo.

### After the Air Defense Drill Ended, the Auxiliary Police Withdrew from Night Duty; Air Defense Exercises Will No Longer Be Announced in Advance

Central News Agency: Due to the recurrence of comprehensive air defense blackout training in the public concessions, various alarms were issued at any time, and even air raid alarms were not lifted overnight. Therefore, the police stations of each concession ordered the governing Baojia districts to instruct each Baojia to require the auxiliary police corps members to maintain guard posts overnight to assist the police in maintaining law and order. Now that the comprehensive air defense training has been successfully concluded on the 23rd, each Baojia has also been ordered to temporarily cancel the auxiliary police corps members' overnight duty and restore the previous duty hours from 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM. However, air defense exercises will be held at any time in the future and will no longer be announced in advance. Therefore, it is still possible to deploy guard posts overnight at any time when necessary. As for the fire brigades, light management brigades, ambulance brigades, and security brigades of each Baojia organization, they will still maintain their original organization. Each member of each brigade should continue to fulfill their duties and gather at the Baozhang's office when they hear various alarms, awaiting dispatch. No one may make excuses or shirk their responsibilities, which will be severely punished.

### Yano Appointed Chief Judge of Consular Court

Danish and Italian Consuls Also Elected

Also elected to positions in the Consular Court along with Mr. Yano are Danish Consul-General Hill and Italian Consul-General Militerno. When the war broke out, Yano was the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong. Yano graduated from the Imperial University of Japan in his early years, joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1926, and was appointed as the Japanese Vice-Consul in Guangzhou in 1931. In 1939, he returned to China and served as the Chief of the Third Section of the China Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He came to Shanghai the following year to work at the consulate. Hill has served as a [position omitted] in the local Consular Court for the past two years. He was born in 1890 and graduated from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. He then served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, serving as an envoy to Tokyo, London, Paris, and other countries. He also served as a Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for two years.

He was appointed as Consul in Hong Kong six years ago and was soon transferred to Shanghai.

### Banks and Money Exchanges Settle Accounts; Markets Closed

The end-of-year account settlement period for 1942 has arrived. Banks, money exchanges, and various firms have already begun to settle their accounts. In addition to the savings department's interest settlement, which has already been completed, the commercial department's interest settlement was rushed yesterday. Therefore, although yesterday was a holiday commemorating the Yunnan Uprising, the staff of the commercial departments of various banks still worked to settle accounts. As for loans without contracts that were issued previously, notices have been issued to repay them in full before the end-of-year account settlement period. In order to maintain the inherent credit of the businesses, each has adjusted their funds and tried to clear debts. As a result, the financial market is tight during this busy period of account settlement. The Central Reserve Bank and the preparation agencies of the banking and money exchange industries have tried their best to adjust the funds of their counterparts and stabilize the market. All markets will be closed due to the account settlement, and the account settlement will be handled. The markets will reopen on January 5 of next year. The Chinese stock market has been closed since yesterday, and all transactions have been cleared.

### Examining the Qualifications of Stockbrokers; The Stockbrokers' Association Will Resume Operations; Resumption of Operations Will Occur After the Examination is Completed; Stock Income Tax Will Be Levied According to Law

Since the authorities approved the resumption of operations of the Stockbrokers' Association under military administration, the specific measures for resuming stock trading after the resumption of operations have been carefully considered and decided. Registration of brokers and listed stocks ended on the 20th of this month. A total of dozens of stocks and a number of brokers have applied for registration. The relevant authorities are conducting a strict review. Formal trading will begin after the review is completed and announced. It is expected that operations can resume next spring.

Selecting Stocks and Reviewing Qualifications

Regarding the resumption of operations of the Stockbrokers' Association and the issue of resuming stock trading, the authorities have decided on (1) the connection between the stock exchange and financial institutions, (2) countermeasures to prevent speculative trading, (3) the selection of stocks allowed to be listed, and (4) the qualifications of brokers. Regarding the selection of listed stocks, whether the business represented by the stock is beneficial to the current situation is a factor. There are hundreds of Chinese stocks today. If they are all allowed to be traded, private capital cannot be concentrated in important industries. As for the qualifications of brokers, they must have considerable credit and assets. The above two major issues are currently being strictly reviewed to prevent malpractices.

Levying Income Tax on Stocks and Bonds

According to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, the income tax collection agency stipulates that the tax rate on income from securities, company bonds, and stocks should be 50 per mille. Stock interest is limited to dividends from joint-stock limited companies and joint-stock partnership companies. In the past, because the operation of various stocks had not been formally recognized by the authorities, it was temporarily impossible to collect taxes after the war. It has now been decided that income tax will be levied according to law on stocks of companies that have been approved for organization and company bonds that have been permitted for issuance. As for the stable financial public bonds and Shanghai municipal bond interest income tax issued by the government, they have been handled at designated banks and collected at the time of interest payment.

### Pilgrimage to the Forefront of North China (Dialogue) (5)

Member of the House of Representatives: Kunitoshi Tsugumo

Secretary-General of the House of Representatives: Osamu Oki

Translated from the December 1942 issue of "Gendai"

These soldiers on the front lines live in caves built into the cliffs of the ravines. There isn't even a single house here. All the nearby residents live a cave-dwelling life. The headquarters and soldiers' dormitories are also in caves. In the very complex terrain, they chose the cliffs of the sunny ravines to build caves, and live their life in the camp there. The water here is very dirty. Not to mention drinking water, they can't even use the water flowing or accumulating nearby when cooking. So they try to dig a well, but they're afraid that the enemy will put poison in it, so they stand guard all night to prevent this well water.

I asked the soldiers here, "How long have you been here?" According to the answer, "The longest is three and a half years." It is said that we are the first comfort group from Japan to come to this front line. They haven't seen a Japanese face for three and a half years. According to an officer there, due to the weather, they can hear the whistle of a train two or three times a year on this front line. So the soldiers all rush outside and listen intently to the whistle. When they hear it, they are so happy that they dance with joy. They are in a remote place isolated from people.

When we went, it happened to be when the soldiers of this unit, which had been dispatched for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Operation, returned from the front line. Inside the headquarters cave, there were two boxes of ashes placed. They set up an altar with brocade and offered incense, beer, and local persimmons, dates, and other fruits and flowers in front of the spirit. They burned incense day and night and offered them fervently. We also knelt and bowed to the memorial tablets placed in the cave. I felt an unspeakable sense of solemnity. Everything on the front line is touching.

Oki: Speaking of water, it reminds me of something. The water in 〇〇〇 is really shockingly bad. It's almost like salt water. Everyone who comes here gets diarrhea once.

Tsugumo: In the first line of southern Shanxi, even if you have white rice, you can't eat white rice, because the water is so dirty, the white rice is said to turn into red rice or black rice when cooked. Especially the water near Yuncheng, which contains a lot of alkali and magnesium sulfate, is really unbearable. However, since the Japanese army stationed there, they have been transporting clean water from several kilometers away in cargo trucks to supply the barracks, hospitals, hotels, etc., so the situation has improved.

Hospitals and Barracks

Oki: When I comforted the hospital in Baotou, I was quite surprised. Although it is located in such a remote place, the equipment is very complete. I don't think people in Japan need to worry at all.

Tsugumo: The completeness of the hospital equipment also surprised me. I really want to convey this news to the parents and brothers at home who have children on the expedition. The hospitals in large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin are very grand in scale and equipment. The average hospitals in Japan cannot compare with them at all. Even the hospitals at the headquarters of the units on the front lines, or their branch hospitals on the front lines, are quite complete. The cold protection equipment is also very complete. The hospitals are mostly built in suitable locations, and inside there are recreation rooms, drawing rooms, sports fields, kitchens, etc., and large halls. Newsreels are shown once a week. The sunlight and ventilation in the sickrooms are no different from those in first-class hospitals in Japan. In particular, the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, which was confiscated as enemy property, is magnificent and full of the latest and best medical equipment made in the United States. It has been distributed to all the wounded soldier hospitals in North China.

Once a patient is admitted to the hospital, even if his body has largely recovered, the authorities will never allow him to return to the front line early. He must be discharged only after he has fully recovered. Therefore, parents and brothers in Japan do not need to worry about their sons or younger brothers staying in the hospital for too long.

Reporter: What do the barracks on the front lines look like?

Tsugumo: The dormitory of the unit on the front lines in 〇〇〇 village that I visited is in a cave, so it's a different story. But even in the cave, it is cleaned very neatly. There isn't even any dust. Ventilation, hygiene, etc. are also very important. In Beijing, Datong, Zhangjiakou, or Taiyuan, in the barracks in the cities, whether they are taking over the barracks of the original Chinese army or building new barracks, the equipment in these places is quite complete, and the sanitary conditions are also quite complete, and there are also restaurant and other facilities.

Oki: The front lines are not barracks but positions, so there's nothing you can do about it.

The Lives of Soldiers on the Front Lines and Local Procurement

Tsugumo: The Japanese army in southern Shanxi has been facing the enemy across the Yellow River for three and a half years. They live in caves and cultivate the fields nearby as farms directly operated by the unit, in order to make themselves self-sufficient in vegetables.

In addition, they also raise cattle, pigs, chickens, etc., which are managed by soldiers with experience or prisoners. Therefore, except for [word omitted] and rice, almost all food can be self-sufficient. You can see fields everywhere in Shanxi Province. The military seems to be encouraging rice cultivation, so that the retired soldiers in the area can engage in farming. The military generally implements the principle of local procurement of goods, and strives to reduce the materials imported from Japan, so that the Shanxi army can be self-sufficient in Shanxi Province, and the North China army can be self-sufficient in the entire North China region. This plan has now been put into practice, so in the near future, the amount of fields will increase and factories will also become complete, and the amount of military supplies imported from Japan will be greatly reduced. This is a side note. The Shanxi army gives each soldier returning home two bolts of Bai Er cloth, which is a local specialty of the province. This is probably to relieve the white cloth panic in Japan.

Reporter: Because of this, it is easier to advance the war.

Tsugumo: The military not only promotes the war, but also does civilian work. Whether it is the mining industry, the textile industry, or even the brewing industry, it is engaged in guidance and cooperation. The military is currently brewing wine in [area omitted], and it tastes very sweet.

Oki: It's a little sweet. The names are "Gofuku," "Asa no Hana," etc. Not Yoru no Hana. (Note: "Yoru no Hana" refers to prostitutes).

Tsugumo: Local procurement is very thorough. For example, on the walls of the barracks in the caves on the front lines, there are slogans posted everywhere: "A piece of paper, a paper clip, are all precious sweat and blood from the home front." We can clearly see that their purpose is to save materials and strive to reduce the supply from Japan, so as not to trouble the people at the home front.

Oki: That's right. The soldiers on the front lines all think that materials in Japan are very scarce and that Japan is in distress. They feel very sorry for asking for various supplies. The front lines [word omitted] are worried about the home front.

Tsugumo: What they want to know most is about the materials in Japan. After explaining this situation to them in detail, they were relieved and smiled. They all feel that the war is like a common meal, but whether or not there is a shortage of materials in Japan has become their only worry, and the depth of their worry is simply beyond our expectations.

Reporter: When the general public and the soldiers on the front lines communicate, they should pay special attention not to talk nonsense and worry them.

### Restricting Gas Consumption; No More Than the Officially Assigned Amount; Supply Will Be Cut Off After Exceeding the Limit Twice

In view of the large increase in gas consumption since the outbreak of the East Asia War, the Shanghai Gas Company has decided to adopt stricter new measures starting from January of next year. If a user's consumption exceeds the officially assigned amount for two consecutive months, the supply will be cut off. According to this method, the highest consumption is the amount of consumption in the month with the most consumption between May and September of this year, plus 10%. If the user's consumption exceeds this amount, the excess will be charged at five times the normal price. If the amount of the excess is twice the normal amount, the excess will be charged at ten times the normal price. If a user exceeds the allocated amount for two consecutive months, the gas company will completely cut off the gas supply. According to relevant sources, it is extremely necessary for the gas company to take this new measure. The gas consumption of ordinary households has increased significantly compared with before the war, especially for industrial uses, which has led to a continuous increase in gas consumption.

### Illegal Radio Sets in the French Concession Must Have Shortwave Equipment Removed; All Sets with Seven or More Tubes Must Be Registered; Those Needed for Official Use Must Apply for Approval

French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Magre, recently issued a notice regarding the control of wireless radio sets, stating, "Regarding the notice issued by the Japanese authorities on December 18 of this year concerning the crackdown on wireless radio sets, residents of the French Concession are urged to pay attention. This notice applies to people of all nationalities. The explanation of what the Japanese authorities refer to as 'illegal radio sets' is further clarified as follows: (1) All radio sets with seven or more tubes, equipped with medium wave or shortwave or both, are included. These radio sets must be registered at the office at 733 Avenue Joffre. Even if the holder needs to use it for official purposes and applies to the authorities for permission to retain its use, they must still register. (2) For radio sets with six or fewer tubes, if they have shortwave equipment or transceiver components, the holder of such a radio set can have the equipment modified at the following stores to remove the shortwave equipment or transceiver components: (A) Philco Radio Company, 9 Avenue Mesny; (B) Olens Company, 1222 Avenue Joffre; (C) Radiax Company, 1532 Avenue Joffre; (D) Radio Manufacturing Company, 145 Rue Tenant de la Tour. The holder must promptly bring the registration certificate issued by the French authorities to the aforementioned stores. The store can usually modify it as required, and after the modification, the store will issue a formal usage certificate to the holder. As for those who need to use radio sets for official purposes and wish to apply for permission to use them, they must prepare an application form, which will be forwarded to the Japanese authorities by this authority. Special forms for the application are available downstairs at the Central Police Station for filling out. Interested parties can go and obtain them."

### An American Illusion

"This article is published in the American Reader's Digest, reprinted from the original abstract of the Sunday supplement of the New York Times. The author, Sheston, is a famous American journalist. He was initially a reporter for the Springfield City News in Ohio, USA, and later served as a special correspondent for the United Press, covering sports and drama. In 1937, he was sent to London to report on important British sports news, and in winter, he covered diplomatic news. In 1939, he was transferred to the New York Times office in London. At the end of 1940, he was transferred back to the United States as a reporter for the New York Times in Washington, D.C. Between 1937 and 1939, he witnessed the situation in Britain where they only fought wars on paper and were complacent. Later, he also saw the consequences. During his stay in Washington, D.C., he witnessed the American people's belief that victory could be achieved simply by Congress passing a massive military expansion budget. He believes this illusion is extremely dangerous, so he issued a warning, pointing out the mistakes in American ideals to awaken them." (Translator's note)

The setbacks encountered by the United States in the months after the start of the war were less a military failure than a psychological failure, because we were not defeated, but rather strategically and tactically inferior to the enemy.

Our previous thinking had been confused by the following illusions. We previously believed that the Axis offensive would not directly threaten our freedom, that the Soviet Union was weak, that Japan was weak, that Italy was simply a farce, and that our democratic fortresses, such as the Maginot Line, the Singapore naval base, and Pearl Harbor, were all impregnable.

The above kind of thinking separated our people and weakened our will, so we and our allied countries suffered defeats everywhere. The battles in the Philippines, Malaya, Libya, China, Burma, and Australia are still painful to this day. German submarines are attacking our ships in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and even invading the outer perimeter of the Panama Canal.

However, although we have experienced repeated dangers and everyone recognizes that they have learned a serious lesson, everyone still has different opinions about what kind of lesson it is. Even now, people still doubt whether our old psychological thoughts, habits, and prejudices have been cleared, and whether the people of the whole country have awakened to the reality of the war.

It is true that before the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt declared his views on what war meant for the country. We cannot blame him for an intellectual failure. There are also many high-ranking officials, especially Mr. Nelson and Mr. Bard, who clearly realize that only action can lead to victory.

However, there are indeed some illusions in the minds of some prominent authorities: the first illusion is that we are the highest and potentially the strongest country in the world, so we will not fail. This is the most absurd! In peacetime, financial resources can solve all difficulties, but a ten-thousand-dollar bill cannot stop a tank!

We are five years behind the Germans in preparing to convert ordinary factories into military factories. In 1941, the United States produced 20 billion yuan worth of commercial goods. The machines that manufactured these goods could have been modified to produce vehicle parts, but now it will take longer to convert an automobile factory to military use than it took for Japan to attack Pearl Harbor, capture Manila, occupy Malaya, close the Burma Road, and capture Singapore.

The wartime atmosphere in Washington, D.C. is still not solemn and strict enough. There are many officials fighting for power.

The second big illusion—that we can win without first-class talent and without eliminating friction between cabinet members and various agencies—is equally dangerous. It is inevitable to invite criticism when many government officials are not first-class people, while talents like Willkie are not in important positions. However, it would be unfair to blame the authorities for wartime administration favoring party members, because there are quite a few Republican party members, such as Harrison, who are in high positions. However, the concentration of talent has not yet been fully realized. Wouldn't it be great if we could form a bipartisan mixed government with victory as the premise?

Even high-ranking officials who recently declared in broadcasts that the United States is currently in the most severe national crisis are saying that Washington, D.C. does not look like it is in a crisis. The Washington Post's social column editor, Mr. Miccari, recently reported: "The recent social scene in this city is unprecedentedly prosperous."

This is not to say that government officials do nothing but socialize. Most of them work hard day and night. However, they ultimately cannot avoid a lot of socializing, and the atmosphere in Washington, D.C. is not one of solemn and strict wartime work.

This kind of socializing, the leisure and elegance of it, is the same as the situation where the heads of various departments and other high-ranking officials spare no effort to waste their intelligence and time on things. The contrast between the wartime administrative situations of the British and American governments is very alarming. In England, everyone is vying for power except for the Admiralty. Here—in the United States—as long as they have power, everyone wants to defeat Hitler. This is naturally not a bad thing, but the general situation is indeed getting worse.

Lack of Unity in Wartime Administrative Agencies

For example, to this day, we have not yet decided who should be responsible for many tasks related to the war effort. The collection of raw materials is currently jointly handled by one office and one committee, while the use of funds is managed by another office. Regarding the promotion of national spirit, the agencies that are also responsible for this include the Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Civil Defense, the Bureau of Military Supplies Production, the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, the Department of State, and the Department of Agriculture, etc. Some are responsible for verifying important documents, while others are responsible for handling routine matters. Regarding economic warfare matters, the Department of State and the Bureau of Economic Warfare also often cannot divide their powers.

In peacetime, this kind of conflict can be regarded as a problem that even the best administrative agencies cannot avoid, and there is no need to pay attention to it. If this conflict is temporary or unimportant, it may be useless to nitpick it. However, this is not peacetime, and this kind of dispute is by no means a trivial matter. It actually has a great hindrance to the basic work of the war effort. The impact of this situation, although one day it will make us heartbroken, is still unchanged.

The third illusion—that we can win without eliminating the naval generals who only know how to defend and do not know how to attack—a civilian can only make a brief statement, but the collapse of France, the repeated setbacks of Britain, and the attack on Pearl Harbor have proven that army generals are usually limited to outdated theories, while naval generals regard warships as management matters rather than offensive weapons.

The four military academies have only recently started aviation training classes. Few people still admit that in some situations, offense is defense. Now we want to ask whether those who adhere to outdated defense policies can win in the most complex naval and military operations in war history?

The National People Should Not Be Obscured by Optimistic Propaganda

The fourth illusion—that the people can fight with all their strength when they are nurtured in an atmosphere of optimistic propaganda—is contrary to the psychology that the British and American people showed at the beginning of the war, who were unwilling to make the greatest sacrifices until the moment of crisis. When the situation in London was the most difficult, its people worked the hardest. Before Germany launched the blitzkrieg, they were immersed in an atmosphere of optimistic propaganda and still did not care. However, when the bombs exploded, they knew that empty promises could not guarantee freedom, so they worked hard!

Our American history also proves that our courage and spirit of sacrifice increase with the degree of recognition of national difficulties. Without understanding the truth of the war, there will be no proper understanding. Without proper understanding, one cannot easily talk about victory.

Wartime Production Work Is Still Too Lax

The fifth illusion—that we can defeat the Axis by working 40 hours a week—has been answered by today's military situation. Although our people have always been limited by the traditions of labor unions, they are now working 55 to 60 hours a week. The Germans are working even more, reaching 60 to 70 hours a week. Can our country not be inferior?

Can money win the war, or are munitions needed? Do we still have time to engage in trivial disputes, personal ambitions, and partisan prejudices? Do we have to obscure the people before we can obscure the Axis powers? If the Axis powers work 60 hours a week and we only work 40 hours, can we catch up and attack their nests? If we do not eliminate these illusions, all the power and advantages of the Axis powers will be enough to hinder us from achieving the war goals announced by President Roosevelt! (Times)

### Turning the Enemy's Invasion Route into the Axis Powers' Offensive Route Translated from Osaka Mainichi Newspaper, December 13

On December 11 of last year, in response to Japan's uprising against the United States and Britain, Germany and Italy also declared war on the United States on the European continent. In the year that followed, the closeness of military cooperation between Germany and Italy has been brought into full play, and the elite of the three Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy have dealt a fatal blow to the United States and Britain.

Seeing the magnificent posture of the New Order countries' advance, the enemy, especially the United States, was taken aback. Previously, it existed as an arsenal for anti-Axis countries, but now it has to stand on the front line. The United States is currently making every effort on two main points in the Pacific: one is to seize the Solomon Islands, preparing to establish an air raid base against Japan there; the other is to turn China into an air force base, preparing to carry out large-scale air raids on the Japanese mainland from there. On the European side, it is trying to build the North African front in parallel with the Soviet Union's winter counter-offensive against Germany.

The arrows drawn on the map indicate the route of the anti-Axis attack. The war is currently in full swing. In whichever battlefield, the Axis powers'陣營are quite strong. There is no question that they will be given a bloody nose back to them if they come to attack. Perhaps the offensive bases of the anti-Axis countries may become the counter-offensive footholds of the Axis powers in the future.

Apart from the Soviet Union, the biggest difficulty for the United States and Britain is that the battlefield is too far from their own country. The Axis powers' submarines are threatening the enemy's transportation routes everywhere at sea, turning their ships, their materials, and their soldiers into seaweed on the seabed. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Germany and Italy's participation in the war against the United States, we wish for further cooperation in the future, and for the prosperity of each other's military fortune.

### Scortto Cup Preliminary Round: Friendship Beats Italian Navy The Result is 1-0, with Victory Determined by Penalty Kicks After the Preliminary Round, the Friendship Team Gets the Right to the Quarterfinals

In the first week of the Scortto Cup football match, Friendship eliminated the Italian Navy yesterday and entered the quarter-final week. In the first half, Sun Jinshun of Friendship missed a penalty kick, so there was no score. In the second half, Zhuo Shijin kicked a penalty kick and scored in one fell swoop, so he won with this goal. The result was 1-0. The two sides were evenly matched, and the victory was determined entirely by luck. The wind and sand were heavy yesterday, which affected the ball's momentum, but both teams played carefully and defended well, giving a very exciting performance, especially the Italian Navy's goalkeeper, Meniati, who was like a god. The Friendship forward repeatedly attacked fiercely, but the iron gate was difficult to break. Now the first week of the Scortto Cup has ended. In the quarter-finals, Friendship will meet St. Francis, and Donghua will meet the Jews. Although the wind was strong yesterday, there were over ten thousand spectators, and the fence of Jiaozhou Park was broken through. Those who arrived later were able to enter for free, which is also a happy event. In the first half, Friendship had the advantage of the wind, so the offensive was very strong. In the fourth minute, the Italian army's right back, Macchetti, crashed into the penalty area. Sun Jinshun's main penalty kick failed. Because the goalkeeper was strong, no score was made in the first half. In the second half, the Italian Navy had the help of the wind, but the Friendship's strict defense still managed to control the battle. In the twelfth minute, Di Panna crashed into Wu Qixiang in the penalty area. Zhuo Shijin kicked a penalty kick and scored in one fell swoop. Friendship then changed from offense to defense until the end of the game.

### Talking About Cultural Issues

— Geng Kuang

Speaking of the recent situation in the Shanghai publishing industry, tabloids are as numerous as bamboo shoots after the rain, and magazines are as numerous as cattle hair, which can be said to be extremely prosperous! If we use this to measure the rise and fall of culture, it seems to be a very gratifying phenomenon. However, if we examine it more carefully, it makes us feel very pessimistic. In terms of the content of various publications, although there are occasionally works on academic aspects that are worth reading, they are as rare as unicorns and phoenix feathers. On the other hand, frivolous works describing lust and talking about romance account for nineteen out of ten. This is a natural result of the editors seeking this and the writers responding to this, which goes without saying. Then, under such a situation in the publishing industry, who can believe that it can raise the level of culture?

Now, if we want to save it, or sort it out, so that the current culture of our country, even if it cannot be improved immediately, must at least not be allowed to fall further, we should start from two aspects: active and passive. On the active side, we should gather like-minded people and organize various small academic groups, specializing in academic research. Any excellent works should be published in the society's publications or published in special collections, for the purchase and reading of the public, without making profit as the goal. If we can get powerful people to support the economy, then the matter can be passed on for a long time. As for the passive aspect, we should strengthen the censorship system. No matter what kind of publication, it must be censored before it can be issued. Any works that are slightly frivolous should be removed without exception. In this way, the atmosphere of the publishing industry will naturally become more and more quiet, and romantic writing will lack an outlet, so who will dare to take the risk to do it? In this way, the level of culture will be raised without being raised!

In addition, there are a few words that I have to say. That is, culture has no so-called new or old. New culture should be nurtured, and old culture should also be preserved. And in terms of people, there should be no restrictions. If we say that only the young people who write vernacular after entering school are qualified to talk about culture, while the old men who used to write classical Chinese are not qualified to talk about culture, it is too unfair. In fact, the only condition is that the thinking is sound, the knowledge is correct, and the work does not contain any toxins, and other things can be ignored. Because in this extraordinary period, all cultural people should stand on the same battle line and do their best to save the country as a prerequisite, how can we divide the territory strongly? Ask the experts, I wonder what they think?

### A Casual Discussion on the Principles and Effects of "Air Injections"

— Peng Liu

Recently, many cases of pulmonary tuberculosis have occurred in Shanghai, which poses a great threat to the health of residents. Generally, those who suffer seek treatment from doctors, and most receive various treatments: vitamins, cod liver oil, air injections, etc. In particular, air injections are an effective modern treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, so what exactly is it? How can it treat pulmonary tuberculosis?

To talk about the topic of air injections, we must first talk about the work of the lungs and tuberculosis. We all know that the lungs are in the chest cavity and are organs dedicated to breathing. When inhaling, the lungs expand, and when exhaling, they contract. Throughout life, breathing never stops, and the lungs expand and contract continuously... How do the lungs move? Originally, although the inside of the chest cavity is not closely connected with the chest wall, they are very close in distance, and the air pressure between the two is extremely low (about six or seven mercury columns lower than the atmospheric pressure). The air inside the lungs is the inhaled atmosphere, and its air pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Under normal circumstances, the lungs are opened by the higher air pressure inside, and although the distance between the lungs and the chest wall is very close, it can always maintain this distance unchanged. When the muscles in the chest cavity move and expand, the lungs also expand with them. When the chest cavity shrinks, the lungs also shrink with it. The lungs themselves can never move and contract on their own. If there is a hole in the chest cavity, then the air outside the body will naturally run between the lungs and the chest wall, so the distance between them will be occupied by air and changed, and the lungs will also be compressed and shrunk. We can understand this by looking at the pig lungs hanging in the butcher shop, which are much smaller than the pig chest (because the air compresses the lungs when they are cut open); and in this case, the compressed lungs can no longer expand and shrink with the chest cavity. Therefore, we know that once air runs into the space between the lungs and the chest wall, it can stop the lungs from moving.

Speaking of tuberculosis of the lungs, everyone knows that it is caused by tuberculosis bacteria in the lungs. The difficulty in treating pulmonary tuberculosis is due to the fact that tuberculosis bacteria are not easy to kill, and also because the lungs are constantly moving and cannot rest, and the lungs' resistance is also weakened. Moreover, because the blood flow in the lungs is smooth, tuberculosis bacteria are easily transported by the blood flow to other organs such as the intestines and kidneys, causing tuberculosis of the intestines and kidneys. Therefore, we think that if we use artificial methods to inject air to compress the lungs and stop them from moving, wouldn't that be able to avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks? This method of artificially injecting air is what we often hear about as "air injections," which is scientifically called "artificial pneumothorax."

The function of air injections is to compress the lungs so that they no longer move, allowing the diseased lungs to rest, and also blocking blood flow to the affected area, preventing tuberculosis bacteria from spreading to other places; and when the lungs have already formed holes, it can make the holes compress and disappear.

However, the effectiveness of air injections also has a certain range. This method can be used when only a small part of the lungs is diseased, but when most or even all of both lungs are diseased, it is impossible to compress most or all of the lungs, because breathing cannot be stopped! Therefore, air injections are indeed very effective for milder lung diseases, but they are only futile for late-stage pulmonary tuberculosis. As for the thorough treatment of lung disease, it still awaits research and invention by the medical community.

### Min Bao Newspaper Agency's Poison Tea Incident

— Yisheng

In the spring of 1908, Mr. Zhang Taiyan and Liu Guanghan lived together at 27 Kyūken-chō, Koishikawa-ku, Tokyo. At that time, both Zhang and Liu were members of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) and fellow students. With shared ideals and common interests, they contacted comrades from all sides every day and jointly carried out revolutionary work. However, soon after, Zhang and Liu had friction due to differences in political views, and eventually became estranged. Liu even told people that Zhang had correspondence with Duan Fang of Nanjing and had reactionary behavior, while Zhang believed that Liu's advocacy of anarchism and socialism violated the party's program, so he immediately moved out of his residence in Kyūken-chō and moved to the upper floor of the Min Bao Newspaper Agency to show that he was severing ties with Liu. At that time, the Min Bao Newspaper Agency was located at 7 Naitōmachicho, Ushigome-ku. As for the reason for the discord between Zhang and Liu, in addition to the differences in political views, Wang Yunsheng's stirring up trouble was also a divisive factor. The so-called Wang Yunsheng was living in Kyūken-chō at the same time as Zhang and Liu. Liu's wife, Ms. He Zhen, always called herself an anarchist and promoted anarchism everywhere, and her romantic behavior had long been despised. Wang Yunsheng and He were both from Yangzhou and had the friendship of fellow villagers. In order to win Ms. He's favor, he tried his best to attack Zhang. No one knows whether Zhang was communicating with Duan Fang of Nanjing. Later, Zhang learned of this matter and warned Liu in a letter, which contained the phrase "raising soldiers under the tent." Therefore, Wang hated Zhang even more and secretly poisoned the teapot (it was in mid-August of that year). This teapot was placed downstairs in the Min Bao Newspaper Agency. Every day after lunch, Zhang would go downstairs after taking a nap upstairs and drink from this teapot. However, this time, the maid in the agency drank it all first. In less than half an hour, the maid had abdominal pain and diarrhea. When she was sent to the hospital, she was already deeply poisoned and died. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department immediately sent several Japanese police officers to the agency to investigate. At this time, Mr. Zhang had not yet come downstairs. When he learned of this matter, he was sure that it must be Wang Yunsheng's conspiracy. On the same day, the Japanese police urgently wanted to arrest Wang, who fled to Shanghai after hearing the news. He was then shot and killed on Nicheng Bridge in Shanghai. After being hit, he struggled to run to the Public Concession police station on the Fourth Road, reporting that he had been shot and saying that someone accused him of being a reactionary. He fell to the ground and died before he finished speaking. It was said that the person who killed Wang was sent by Tao Huanzhang.

### "Dealing with People" vs. "Confronting People"

— Cheng Jusun

"Dealing with people" is expressing goodwill towards others, while "confronting people" is taking malicious actions.

"Dealing with people" is a way of self-defense, while "confronting people" is a strategy for attacking others.

People often gain the favor of others by "dealing with them," but provoke aversion by "confronting them."

Smilingly "dealing" with others is not an act of "flattery," and engaging in scheming and rivalry to "confront" others is certainly not a self-satisfied masterpiece.

However, they originate from the same point: "Cunning." Because of the different ways it is applied, the results are opposite. "Dealing with people" is cleverly applying "cunning," while "confronting people" is blindly applying "cunning." The "cunning" of "dealing" is concealed, while the cunning of "confronting" is obvious. The application methods differ subtly, leading to the issue of skill. As the saying goes, "Everyone can perform magic tricks, but each has different skills." That is exactly what it means.

Since both "dealing with people" and "confronting people" are forms of cunning trickery, shouldn't we stay away from them and eliminate them? However, in this world of vice, the environment and life force people to get close to them and use them constantly. Then we must use this trickery more "skillfully." But after "careful consideration," I believe we should use the method of "dealing with people" to "confront people," and not use the intention of "confronting people" to "deal with people." This way, we might achieve the "effect" of being "neither cunning nor deceitful," or at least earn a "reputation" of being "cunning but not deceitful" or "deceitful but not cunning"!

### On What Day Does the Year Begin?

— Tong

On what day does the year begin? I'm afraid very few people can truly answer this question. Chinese people celebrate the Gregorian New Year every year, followed by a Lunar New Year! Washington's birthday has two dates, one on February 11th and the other on February 22nd. He could choose when to celebrate his birthday based on the situation. In other words, he had eleven days of freedom to arrange his birthday. At the same time, Westerners also have two New Years, one ecclesiastical and one commercial. Ancient Greeks used the summer solstice as New Year's Day, but the French Revolutionary calendar during the French Revolution made the autumn equinox the beginning of the year. Ancient Egyptians divided the year into twelve months, with thirty days per month, leaving five days with no month to belong to, and every 1461 years their New Year rotated through the seasons from spring to winter. July 16, 622 AD is the beginning of the Islamic calendar, but in 1933, the Islamic New Year was March 23rd! Christianity established itself, using December 25th as the Christian era. Before the revolution, Russia's New Year was thirteen days behind other European countries. Astronomically speaking, the beginning of the year is also divided into the perihelion year, the solar year, and the sidereal year. A detailed account of the evolution of all these calendars and their scientific explanations can be found in the first issue of Volume 3 of the Tianjin Monthly Science Pictorial.

### Sharing the Boat in Storm

Before long, the door of the Chen family opened with a "creak." Huang Long softly called out, "Hey!" Wei Cheng said, "I'm here!" Wei Cheng asked, "Are they asleep?" Huang Long said, "I didn't bother to look, but they have lights on. You come in with me first." Wei Cheng felt the wall and stepped into the gate. Huang Long closed the door casually, turned around, and led Wei Cheng to another door inside. Sure enough, light was shining from the curtains on the glass window. The two of them stood in the courtyard, far away from the glass window. Huang Long said, "Do you know whose room that is, the one with the light?" Wei Cheng said, "That's where Guofang lives. I know we should go through the door in the west wing and around to the main house." Huang Long took Wei Cheng's hand and walked towards the steps of the main house, trying to see through the cracks which room with a light someone was lying in. But the light was dim, and the curtains happened to be tightly covering the glass window, making it impossible to see what was inside the room. Wei Cheng pointed to the west, telling Huang Long to walk to the west wing and around to the back. Huang Long just moved his foot, and his foot hit a pottery object, probably not a flower pot but a bowl. Wei Cheng was startled and listened attentively, but couldn't hear anyone in the room waking up.

Fumbling to the west steps, Wei Cheng relied on his experience from having been there a few times before, and put his finger on a door, which gave him the trick, without any sound, the door was opened, and two people flashed inside. Wei Cheng said, "Feel the wall and walk inside, you can walk to the room with the light." Huang Long nodded in the dark, Wei Cheng did not feel it, based on some light from the main room shooting into the yard, and folded back to the west wing, they actually touched the main room. I don't know why, Wei Cheng's heart, the more it is heading towards the road to success, the more violently it is shaking. He tremblingly said, "I remember, this room is where Guoqi lives, the one with the light is where Guofang lives." Huang Long said, "I know, come on, whether male or female, there is no life." Huang Long pulled out the knife from his sock, held it in his hand, tried it in the air, walked into the dark room, felt the bed rail, felt the quilt, along the edge of the bed, turned around and said, "You come and hold down his leg." He lifted the knife and used force to slash down.

### Einstein's Letter of Recommendation — One of the Letters of World-Renowned Scientists

— Lincoln Schuster Translated by Gu Xin

Background

Perhaps the reason a genius is a genius is that he can recognize the genius of others. When Albert Einstein first publicly published his "Special Theory of Relativity" in 1905, he was 26 years old, and he "invited others to build upon his work." At this time, he was working in the Swiss Patent Office, doing his daily duties. He constantly concentrated his mind, studying light - using a fountain pen and a notepad as the only equipment in his laboratory, transforming the universe. He had already married in 1903, and in the next two years he wrote five scientific papers; the last of which was that epoch-making "Special Theory."

Only a few thinkers and scientists paid attention to Einstein's publication in 1905. Among this small group, the most noteworthy was Max Planck, the discoverer of the "Original Quantum," who wrote Einstein a delightful letter, encouraging him and calling the special theory of relativity a "revolution in human thought."

Six years passed, and although Einstein's reputation was growing internationally, he was still seeking a permanent position in various universities. It was not until 1911 that two great collaborators in the mathematical and physical sciences—Henri Poincaré and Marie Curie—came forward to help him by writing him a letter of recommendation, which "fully demonstrated prophetic foresight." Poincaré drafted the letter, but Curie also signed it. The recipient was the "Federal Institute of Technology" in Zurich.

"Future will gradually prove the credit of Mr. Einstein.…"

Text

Mr. Einstein is one of the most original minds we know. Though still young, he has already achieved a respectable position among the most advanced scientists of the present day. We are most amazed at his ease, his composure, which enables him to adapt himself to new concepts and to deduce possible meanings from them. He does not cling to classical principles, but only sees all possible possibilities when faced with physical problems. In his mind, this has become a prediction of new phenomena, which will one day be confirmed by practical experience. Future will gradually prove the credit of Mr. Einstein, and if your university can invite him to come, it will surely gain honor by being associated with this young scholar.

Henri Poincaré

Marie Curie

Aftermath

Such a sincere and moving letter of recommendation naturally had a great impact on the college, and Einstein received an appointment, joining the faculty in 1912.

He held this position until 1914, when he was appointed director of the physics department at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. The following year, at the age of thirty-six, he published his General Theory of Relativity. Although this aroused great interest in the scientific community, the public was almost completely unaware of it until 1919, when his reputation shook the world overnight. That year, photographs taken of the solar eclipse fully confirmed his theory. This was largely thanks to Carr Van Anda, the managing editor of the New York Times, who happened to have a keen interest in mathematics and astronomy. Einstein once praised Madame Curie with the words—"Fame cannot harm her"—which could also be applied to himself. In 1921, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1933, he left Nazi Germany, and in recent years, he has been the director of the mathematics department at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University in New Jersey, USA.
