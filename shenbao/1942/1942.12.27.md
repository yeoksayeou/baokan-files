### Regarding the Issue of Japanese Students

Our nation's system of sending students abroad originated in the Tang Dynasty. At that time, figures like Xuanzang and Faxian endured hardships to travel to India for Buddhist studies. Japan also dispatched its talented students to study in Tang China. For a time, East Asian culture was exchanged and promoted, and for over a thousand years, Eastern culture was able to develop into its own system, which must be attributed to the efforts of our nation's pioneering students abroad. By the late Qing Dynasty, the country's power declined daily, and British and American influence penetrated deep into the interior. Westernized education spread everywhere, and the system of sending students abroad also became increasingly prosperous. The merits and demerits of this are still difficult to determine. However, we cannot say that there were no achievements in the exchange of Sino-Western culture. Moreover, the close relationship between the majority of students abroad and national politics, to the point of the rise and fall of the entire national destiny, cannot but be the responsibility of the students abroad. It makes people look back on the past with a sense of pain and worry about the future.

Speaking of the situation of students abroad, the best impression on the Chinese people is of students who studied in Germany. Due to the development of German culture and education and the strict training, every student who returns from Germany, judging by their words and deeds, fully demonstrates seriousness, sincerity, and responsibility. What is especially endearing is that almost everyone has true knowledge and skills. Therefore, after returning to the country, whether in politics, military affairs, economics, culture, science, or medicine, they can fully exert their talents and make practical contributions to the motherland. This is not to deliberately elevate the status of German students; the facts of the past are well known to everyone. Looking back at the students who studied in England and America, apart from a few outstanding individuals with specialized knowledge who have made contributions to the country and society, the majority have only learned a luxurious lifestyle. In the small sense, they have become countless赘疣 for the country and society, adding a group of high-class Chinese who only know how to consume and not produce; in the large sense, they cannot help but regard national affairs as child's play, lead national policies to cater to the likes and dislikes of others, and use the country's resources and manpower for the benefit of other countries. This cannot but make people sigh. As for students who studied in Japan, historically they have been the longest and in number the most numerous, and their relationship with the country and society has been the closest. Indeed, there have been many extraordinary figures among them who have played a decisive role in Chinese politics, both in the past and now. However, apart from a few such figures, most of the general students in Japan, from their own perspective, either went to Japan to study because they were short of funds and chose the easy way, or because they were eager to achieve quick results and chose what was near. From the social aspect, also because Japan is not far from the country, there is an incorrect and condescending view of Japanese students. However, can Japan treat Chinese students without any hesitation and provide them with the same kind of education as their own children? This question is probably not easy to answer affirmatively.

We don't need to talk about the past too much. However, at this moment when the fate of East Asia is being decided, at this moment when the people of China and Japan are shouldering important missions, we cannot but pay special attention to Chinese students in Japan. Because the current group of students in Japan will be the basic cadres for future friendly relations between China and Japan and for promoting the completion of the mission of the times by the two countries. To demand satisfactory results in the future, we must not hesitate to sow the seeds diligently today. We hope that the authorities will be more strict in the selection of students to be sent to Japan and will provide more adequate assistance. We sincerely hope that the relevant Japanese authorities will be particularly strict with Chinese students and must treat Chinese students as their own children, caring for them and educating them so that they have specialized knowledge and can use what they have learned. We must recognize that in the academic world, national boundaries and barriers must be removed in order to truly exchange and advance Chinese and Japanese cultures and to enable China and Japan to jointly complete the mission assigned to us by the times. Today, whoever takes pains to care for and educate each other's children will also share the delicious fruits in the future.

### Minister Lin Expresses His Thoughts on Visiting Japan

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – Lin Baisheng of the Propaganda Department of the National Government, who accompanied the Chairman on his visit to Japan, was very busy with social engagements. In the midst of his busyness, he wrote an article entitled "Thoughts on Accompanying the Chairman on His Second Visit to Japan," which is published as follows: This is the second time I have accompanied the Chairman on his visit to Japan, and the fifth time for me personally. Although each trip is very short, cumulatively they have given me a deeper and broader understanding of the inherent spirit of the people of the friendly nation. The Chairman has said that war is a general review of the national spirit, and the Greater East Asia War can be said to be a catalyst for the gradual flourishing of the inherent spirit of the people of the friendly nation. What I saw this year is even more amazing than last year, and even more profound than two months ago. This is the first thing that moved me most on this trip. Since the peace movement, my interactions with people from friendly nations have gradually increased. These interactions are not limited to any one class. In these interactions, I always hold a sincere attitude. This is how people should interact with each other, and isn't the same true for countries? The people from the friendly nation that I saw on this trip, judging from their tense faces, know that they are very busy with national affairs at all times. But no matter how busy they are, when they talk about Chinese friends and meet East Asian comrades, they always have heartfelt talks. They are so sincere about the current situation in China, so hopeful for China's future, and so enthusiastic about the way out for East Asia. I know that the sincere spirit that the peace movement relies on has filled the hearts of people from both countries, becoming the driving force for the relationship between the two countries to leap forward towards brightness. As for Prime Minister Tojo's keen eyes, decisive demeanor, and sonorous voice, they are telling the world that the decisive battle situation of the Greater East Asia War has the certainty of victory, and the stage for the leap forward in Sino-Japanese relations has also been established and is unfolding. This is the second thing that moved me most on this trip. Throughout his life, the Chairman has always held the revolutionary spirit of forging ahead, from assisting Dr. Sun Yat-sen in leading the people to overcome countless difficulties and dangers for decades. Even when the situation turned unfavorable, what the Chairman instructed his comrades was, "Only when there are difficulties, only when there are dangers, do we need to redouble our efforts to overcome all difficulties and break through all dangers." And when the situation improved, what the Chairman instructed his comrades was, "Only when we have gained hope, only when we have gained brightness, do we need to redouble our efforts to meet this hope and ensure this brightness." This means, "Difficult things in the world, as long as you work hard," "There are no easy things in the world, you still need to work hard." This is the third thing that moved me most on this trip. The integration of these three sentiments has added infinite courage to me for the current struggle. I hope that my compatriots will rise up together and follow the advanced countries, preparing for even more arduous efforts and more courageous struggles to welcome the soon-to-come brightness and the New Year filled with hope.

### European War Situation Entering Decisive Year: Special Correspondent Kawasaki of Osaka News Agency in Berlin; Translated from "Osaka News" December 19th

The European war situation in 1942 will continue with the snowy and frigid Eastern Front and the furnace-like North African Front as the two major battlefields. The Eastern Front has spanned two summers, while the Tunisia and Algeria Front has just begun. In any case, both sides will be extended into next year, and are currently engaged in accumulating combat power. How Germany and Italy will unfold the new European war situation next year, like the development of the East Asian war situation next year, is what we are currently most concerned about.

The first objective of the war against Germany promoted by the US and Britain is to drive the Rommel army in Libya and the Italian army in Tunisia and Algeria out of North Africa in succession, and to place North Africa completely under US-British control. The second objective is to use North Africa as a base to begin offensive operations on the continent, that is: to harass Italy from western Cyrenaica and the southern end of Italy, to invade the Balkans along the Salonika coast of Greece, and even to begin invasion operations in Spain or Portugal. Such US-British propaganda has been greatly hyped up since the successful invasion of French Northwest Africa by the US-British forces. However, after examining the combat power and transportation capacity of both sides, it can be seen that such propaganda is extremely difficult to become a reality, and can only be used as a perspective on the 1943 war situation, making the topic more complex and interesting. Because Germany and Italy have already established a new strategic situation in North Africa to cope with the new situation, it is really not as easy as it sounds for the US-British forces to increase their combat power and train local soldiers in a short period of time in order to wipe out the German-Italian forces in North Africa.

In addition, on the German-Soviet Eastern Front, there have been various divergent judgments, both optimistic and pessimistic, regarding the Soviet Union's combat power. However, these judgments are not based on accurate statistics, but on the intuition of the parties involved, so there are inevitably many exaggerations and inappropriate points. It is true that the Soviet Union has prepared a huge amount of troops, weapons, and materials that will surprise the world, and has continued a considerable and admirable national resistance for more than a year. This is an undeniable fact. But the war results achieved by Germany should not be underestimated. Judging from the figures released by Germany, even if discounted, the blow it has given to the Soviet Union is one that cannot be recovered for a while.

To tell the truth, this year's German-Soviet war is a battle for food, mainly wheat, and coal. From this meaning, everyone feels that the Caucasus operation is still in full swing. Minister of Propaganda Goebbels said on the 17th: "Germany does not allow defensive warfare, it must always be offensive." This sentence implies the new offensive next year.

The question here is: How will the German army handle the two-front war against the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain?

The goal of the US and Britain in their operations and propaganda has always been to expand the German army's front and make the German army exhausted. Now, with the opening of the new North African Front, the US and Britain have launched a two-front war against Germany, and at the same time, they have a legitimate excuse to attack the Soviet Union. However, judging from the current deployment of the German army and the strength of the US-British forces in North Africa, it is obvious that it is not necessarily possible to launch a two-front war against Germany. Napoleon, a master of two-front warfare, said: "The key to two-front warfare is to add as many troops as possible to the offensive front and reduce as many troops as possible to the defensive front. This way, you can rest easy." As far as the German army is concerned, even if the Eastern Front and the North African Front appear to be a two-front war, Hitler will definitely not abandon the war against the Soviet Union. Looking at it this way, the perspective for next year has become something of common sense, and fierce operations and a vast battlefield are certain. That is to say, when this world war is increasingly clearly revealing the true face of a long-term war, Germany's top priority is to establish an invincible system for all of Europe as soon as possible. The establishment of this invincible system, from the point of view of resources, must be based on thoroughly defeating the Soviet Union and seizing its resource areas. Regarding the future war policy, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels has already publicly declared: "Seize the enemy's resource areas." In this regard, we can also get a glimpse of the German army's heroic posture in the war against the Soviet Union next year. Of course, it is not uncommon for the war situation to deviate from the normal path. Depending on the situation and conditions, temporary changes may be possible. On the relatively fragile resistance lines in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Balkans, the possibility of new fronts being opened is not entirely absent. But no matter whether the war situation develops into a two-front war or a three-front war, as long as we recall the position Germany was in during the last World War, we can be fearless.

In addition, the German army is making every effort to strengthen its new air force and utilize new weapons. Even if it consumes some resources in the war against the Soviet Union, it still has plenty of troops. Germany's position in Europe is "waiting at ease for the exhausted enemy." The United States has come from afar, and it is clear who benefits and who suffers. In short, Germany's current war guidance is to make the establishment of a long-term system the primary goal, and all war situations are facing this goal, making adjustments with urgency and flexibility, and will continue to do so in the future.

### German and Italian Forces Firmly Defend Tunisian Positions: British Forces Advance Westward Along Libyan Coast, Axis Forces Prepare to Intercept

Berlin, 26th (Havas News Agency dispatch): According to news received here from North Africa, German and Italian forces continued to firmly defend their positions in Tunisia yesterday. US forces launched an attack, attempting to seize a mountaintop, but were repelled by Axis forces, resulting in the capture of many prisoners and a large amount of machine guns and other military equipment. The enemy's offensive in central Tunisia was also defeated. German and Italian forces immediately counterattacked.

Lisbon, 26th (Domei News Agency dispatch): According to an official announcement from Cairo, British forces occupied Said in Libya at noon yesterday. This agency received a report from Algiers Radio, stating that Axis aircraft approached Algiers in the evening, and air raid alerts were issued four times.

Rome, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The Italian military headquarters announced that the fighting in Tunisia has intensified again. German and Italian forces have made progress in the positions they have been contesting for many days. Despite the adverse weather conditions, Italian aircraft attacked the port of Algiers. One Italian aircraft did not return. In the area of Said, only patrol activities occurred yesterday.

Berlin, 25th (Domei News Agency dispatch): According to aerial reconnaissance, the British Eighth Army is advancing westward along the coast road, over one hundred kilometers south of Benghazi. This British move clearly indicates a large-scale attack. The Axis forces are also secretly preparing to intercept. The outcome of the strategies of both sides will be revealed within days.

Bern, Switzerland, 25th (Havas News Agency dispatch): There was fierce fighting on the front lines of Tunisia in North Africa yesterday. However, the situation around Tripoli was relatively calm. According to German and Italian reports, the fighting in Libya has lasted for two months. Yesterday, only skirmishes occurred between scouting parties. German and Italian forces are still retreating automatically according to their planned schedule. The British advance is extremely slow. This is because the Axis forces have laid landmines along the way during their retreat and destroyed the roads. In addition, the British forces under General Montgomery have excessively long supply lines, making it difficult to resupply food and ammunition, which is also a factor in the slow progress of their march. The port of Tobruk is the main port of supply for the British forces, but it is approximately 800 miles from the British front lines. It is reported that the vanguard of the British forces has reached Buerat el Hsun (sixty miles west of Sirte). However, fierce fighting continues near the port of Sirte. Furthermore, Axis forces have established defensive lines near the port of Misurata, which is located between Buerat el Hsun and the port of Tripoli and is the port of Libya. Also yesterday, Axis aircraft engaged in fierce aerial combat with British and American air forces over Crete. Both sides also bombed each other's ships off the coast of North Africa. Regarding Tunisia, according to news from Berlin, Axis forces repelled an offensive by British and American forces north of Medjez el Bab yesterday, capturing many enemy soldiers and a large amount of military equipment. A unit of British and American forces southwest of Mateur was also annihilated by German and Italian forces. Due to the adverse weather conditions, there was no major activity on other fronts. According to German sources, the British First Army has been concentrating its forces in various key military locations. General Eisenhower has also recently received a large amount of supplies. The British and Americans are poised to launch another offensive. However, the Axis authorities have taken necessary measures to cope with the situation.

### Darlan's Funeral Held, Assassin Executed: Name Not Announced by British Authorities, It Is Said That Grew Will Visit Washington

Lisbon, 26th (Domei News Agency dispatch): According to a Reuters dispatch from Algiers, the assassin of Darlan, only twenty years old, was sentenced to death by a French military tribunal last night and executed at dawn today. The assassin fully confessed to the assassination and insisted that he had no accomplices. British sources still say that the assassin is French, but his name is being kept secret for military reasons. News received here says that the assassin is French and observers believe that this action was instigated by the British government or the Grew faction.

Tangier, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): According to news from Algiers, the remains of Admiral Darlan were moved to the Algiers Cathedral last night. A memorial service was held today, attended by military and political figures. The coffin was then moved to the chapel of the High Commissioner's office. General Giraud also attended the memorial service. Governor General Chatel of Algiers also laid a wreath.

Bern, Switzerland, 26th (Domei News Agency dispatch): Regarding the assassination of Darlan, the Allied Headquarters in North Africa announced that the assassin was a French youth, aged twenty. The initial investigation has not revealed the motives for the assassination. However, it is generally believed that political infighting in North Africa is extremely severe. The British Grew faction, the Soviet Union, and the Vichy regime all wanted to eliminate Darlan. In addition, the French National Committee, which Darlan had organized, is scheduled to meet today to elect a successor. In the meantime, General Giraud will temporarily act as head.

Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The New York Times editorial stated that the North African problem has not been resolved after Darlan's assassination. It is still unknown how the Allied nations will resolve the problems caused by Darlan's assassination.

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to a dispatch from London, Grew has decided to visit Washington in the near future.

Germany Issues Official Commentary

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): Schmidt, director of the German Foreign Intelligence Service, yesterday issued Germany's official commentary on Darlan's assassination to Haitong News Agency, saying that the person responsible for Darlan's assassination is very clear. Anyone who pays attention to the British and American policies in North Africa should know that Britain was determined to get rid of Darlan quickly. Therefore, this assassination was undoubtedly initiated by London. German newspapers reprinted enemy reports of conflict between Darlan and Grew, as the discord between Darlan and Grew had caused tension between Britain and the United States. With Darlan's death, this dispute has been resolved, which is particularly advantageous to Britain. Schmidt continued that Britain is trying to shift the responsibility for Darlan's assassination to Germany. After the assassin was arrested, the enemy authorities kept the assassin's nationality and affiliation strictly secret, which is suspicious. Those involved are likely drafting the assassin's confession in order to frame others. This is a common trick of Britain, and it is not surprising. Western European democratic countries do not consider assassination as a means to eliminate political enemies to be illegal. The Axis powers do not endorse such banditry. The Axis powers advocate striking the enemy with force. Germany has always regarded Darlan as a traitor to the new order in Europe. Now this man's life has been ended by assassination. When Darlan was advocating Franco-German cooperation, he repeatedly declared that his family had been fighting against England for three hundred years. Therefore, Darlan's hatred of England was a family tradition. Schmidt concluded by commenting on the joy of Britain after Darlan's assassination, which serves as a serious warning to others who hope for anything from Britain.

France Does Not Emphasize Death of Darlan

Vichy, 25th (Havas News Agency dispatch): Regarding the assassination of Admiral Darlan in North Africa, people in the government here do not place much emphasis on the death of a person who betrayed his country, abandoned his countrymen, and opened the door to invaders in North Africa. Therefore, no official comment was made. Newspapers in Paris published this news with large headlines, and some newspapers stated that "London's British Broadcasting Corporation must have been extremely pleased when it issued the news of Darlan's assassination." Other newspapers also strongly stated that there are at least four different interpretations of this tragedy. Berlin believes that President Roosevelt's comments on the matter are of great significance. According to semi-official German sources, Roosevelt's so-called "cowardly assassin" was probably hired by the detective bureau and was probably known to Roosevelt. His remarks were directed at Prime Minister Churchill. This incident occurred in Algiers yesterday, and the divergence of opinions between Britain and the United States can also be seen in this. Subsequently, Roosevelt and Churchill will continue to speak of "close friendship" on the radio. In reality, Churchill's obstruction of the American North African plan has already created an insurmountable new obstacle on the path to "unanimity and cooperation between Britain and the United States after the war."

### Bulgarian Finance Minister Delivers Speech, Controls Rising Prices

Sofia, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): Bulgarian Finance Minister Bozhilov delivered a speech to the National Assembly a few days ago, lasting three and a half hours, discussing the country's economic and financial situation. He stated that Bulgaria, like other European countries, cannot isolate itself from the scope of European economic development and seek development alone. The Bulgarian authorities are currently concentrating their efforts on controlling the rise in commodity prices. The Bulgarian currency has increased from 1.5 million leva to 1.8 million leva due to the incorporation of Macedonia and Thrace into Bulgaria. In terms of the ratio of the amount of banknotes issued to the population, it is one of the countries with the least amount of banknotes issued in Europe, except for Portugal. The country's assets have increased to 1.17 trillion leva since 1939. The national debt situation is also very good. International trade is also expected to have good progress this year. Bulgaria will continue to promote economic cooperation with Germany.

### Fierce Fighting Erupts Between German and Soviet Forces in Don and Volga Regions: German Forces Launch Large-Scale Counteroffensive Southwest of Stalingrad: German Forces Launch Annihilation Battle Northeast of Alakir

Fuhrer Headquarters, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The German military headquarters declared that Soviet forces lost 30 aircraft during the Christmas period. German aircraft heavily attacked Soviet artillery positions and railways in the northern part of the Eastern Front yesterday. Soviet forces lost 29 tanks on the Terek front and 42 tanks in the Don and Volga regions. German aircraft also assisted in the fighting day and night. Hungarian forces annihilated many enemies on the east bank of the Don River. German forces heavily damaged Soviet forces northwest of Voronezh and west of Kaluga, capturing many prisoners. Soviet offensives in the central part of the Eastern Front have failed. Soviet forces, assisted by tanks, aircraft, and artillery, were repelled in the Luki area. Soviet forces lost 10 tanks southeast of Lake Ilmen. Air transport teams provided supplies day and night to the fiercely contested bases on the front lines. There was only patrol activity in Libya. German aircraft conducted low-altitude attacks on British forces. The port of Benghazi was attacked at night. German and Italian forces made good progress in Tunisia. German and Italian aircraft also attacked the port of Algiers and the airfield in Algeria.

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to news received here, the defensive battles between German and Soviet forces in the middle reaches of the Don River have suddenly intensified since the 25th. The battle line has expanded to a length of 800 kilometers, extending from the vicinity of Rossosh in the north to Kamensk in the south. On this battle line, the two armies are engaging in hand-to-hand combat in various places, braving the cold wind and snow. Although the Soviet Information Bureau claimed on the 25th that the Soviet forces under General Vatutin had crossed the railway between Voronezh and Kharkov south of Morozovsk and invaded the Ukrainian border and were currently attacking the Kharkov and Rostov railway, this agency has received news that there is no sign of Soviet forces having broken through the Ukrainian border. However, the main defensive force of the German army seems to be concentrated on the defensive line of Millerovo and Kamensk. Since the 24th, the German army has actively reinforced the front lines with strong forces carried by large transport planes and has also landed a large number of forces behind the Soviet lines to defeat the Soviet combat power. At noon on the 25th, the German army completely surrounded most of the Soviet troops possessing combat power northeast of Millerovo and smoothly launched a sweeping battle. The Soviet forces suffered extremely heavy losses.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to news received here, Soviet forces launched a fourth counteroffensive in the area of Olkhoshchnik on the central Caucasus front line on the 24th.

The Soviet authorities announced at noon on the 25th that they had recaptured Alakir. However, according to subsequent news from the front lines, the main German mechanized forces have reinforced in large numbers and launched a fierce counterattack. They have repelled the Alakir Soviet forces and completely surrounded their rearguard troops northeast of the city. An annihilation battle is currently underway.

Soviet Border, 25th (Havas News Agency dispatch): The radio station here recently broadcast a message stating that German forces launched a large-scale counteroffensive southwest of Stalingrad yesterday. At the same time, German mountain troops also launched a counteroffensive northwest of Tuapse, both of which were of a diversionary nature to reduce the pressure on German forces in the middle reaches of the Don River.

### Roman Pope's Christmas Broadcast

Vatican City, 25th (Havas News Agency dispatch): Pope Pius XII delivered a radio address today, calling on the people to strive to restore world order and peace. He said that only by promoting the spirit of Jesus can this goal be achieved. In this world of widespread warfare, the development of war has made all mankind unfortunate. The Church cannot stand idly by. It can only pursue the internal policies of various countries, work separately, and not participate on any side. However, it must warn the people that all human activities will have concerns belonging to political principles. The Church has repeatedly refuted Marxism and communism. On this Christmas, the Church should reiterate its condemnation, but it must remind every Christian that it is necessary to find ways to solve industrial problems. The dignity of the working class must be respected, so that those engaged in agricultural and industrial production can live and work in peace and share happiness. We should always remember the main points of the Christian faith, which is, in essence, to know only how to serve and not want to dominate others. Therefore, we should immediately redouble our efforts to restore social peace and understand that all activities that are not based on the principle of justice are not only futile but also an incitement to evil. In short, the star of Bethlehem will once again illuminate this unfortunate world. I wish all Catholics around the world a Merry Christmas.

The gist is that the residents of Hong Kong will never forget this memorial day of December 25th. It has been a year since the Japanese army captured Hong Kong. On this memorial day, we would like to propose three points as our ideals for the future: (1) Make this memorial day have great significance; (2) Resolve to complete the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere; (3) Realize overall peace between China and Japan. We should strive to practice the above three points on this memorial day. Since we have expressed the above three points, we should naturally cooperate with our friendly nation Japan, share weal and woe, and contribute to the country and nation with a spirit of hard work and sacrifice of personal interests. China and Japan have a unified oriental moral culture, and tracing back to the origin, they should be peaceful and friendly. Today, Hong Kong is in the Co-Prosperity Sphere and has the advantage of geographical location. If it also has the right timing and human harmony, it will surely become more prosperous.

### A Tour of the Forefront of North China (Panel Discussion) (6)

Councilor of the House of Representatives, Kunikatsu Tsuyun - Secretary General of the House of Representatives, Osamu Oki

Translated from the December issue of "Modern Times," year 31

Tsuyun: The conservation of resources at the front lines has reached its limit. Gasoline conservation, too, is quite thorough. Except in the case of battlefield engagements, the front-line troops absolutely never use gasoline to operate transport trucks. This is something I heard directly from the commanding officer. Recently, in battles, soldiers have been picking up spent bullet casings and putting them in their pockets to bring back.

Oki: Deceased soldiers are found with spent bullet casings in their pockets. In the face of life and death, how can they still bother with bullet casings? Yet they carefully put them in their pockets. It's truly moving and heartbreaking to hear.

Transportation, Logistics, and Japanese Residents

Reporter: Next, what is the state of transportation and logistics in North China? That is, what is the condition of the transportation infrastructure?

Tsuyun: We know that the railroads between Datong in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan, and between Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang, were originally narrow gauge. Since the Japanese army occupied the area, they have been converted to broad gauge. This is primarily to meet the needs of troop movements, but the main purpose is to transport supplies. In addition, the construction of the Shide Line (Shijiazhuang-Dezhou Line) has been completed. It is absolutely necessary to lay the railroad between Shijiazhuang and Dezhou in order to transport materials from Shanxi Province to Qingdao, or from Qingdao to Shanxi Province. Furthermore, railroad line improvements can be seen everywhere. For example, to straighten out winding sections, I heard they are digging tunnels to shorten the route by thirty minutes in one place and twenty minutes in another. These route improvement projects are being managed by the North China Transportation Company.

Oki: Along the Jingbao Line (Beijing-Baotou Line), on the way from Beijing to Zhangjiakou in Mengjiang (Mongolian Border Region), there is a pass called Juyongguan. The terrain around the pass is very steep. Because Mongolia is a plateau, it is thousands of feet higher than Beijing. Therefore, the transportation of goods has never reached the ideal level. So, there is a plan to lay another railroad track. It will probably be completed in two or three years. The problem is only maritime transport.

Reporter: Regarding the actual situation of Japanese residents, or the living conditions of British and American enemy nationals…

Oki: Since October 1st, British and Americans in Beijing and Shanghai, the so-called enemy nationals, must wear red armbands on their left arms so they can be easily identified. This is certainly a good thing. However, the way they are treated really needs to change. In Beijing, they are seen riding bicycles or rickshaws, showing no signs of feeling inferior. I think the treatment is too lenient. Their freedom of residence should be restricted somewhat.

From the perspective of Japanese morality, it seems that Japan is still a bit afraid of Britain and America, so it doesn't dare to oppress them excessively. This greatly damages Japan's prestige. From this point of view, I also hope to show the Chinese people the substantial power of Japan, which is being fully demonstrated on the bodies of the British and Americans.

Tsuyun: Why are they treated that way in China? I haven't heard the reason. In any case, it is really too lenient. Of course, their living expenses have been reduced considerably, and since they are used to luxury, it is probably quite painful for them. Secondly, the development of Japanese people in the major cities of North China is very noticeable. I arrived in Zhangjiakou on the Mid-Autumn Festival, and in Taiyuan on a holiday. Looking at the people walking on the streets, there were more Japanese than Chinese, which really surprised me. In the city of Yuncheng, there are many Japanese-owned hotels, red bean soup shops, biscuit stores, and so on. Late at night, I saw a geisha carrying a shamisen, walking and laughing on a dark road. This scene was just like a rural town in Japan.

The New People's Society and the Public Security Enhancement Movement

Reporter: You have actually inspected the guidance of the National Movement, haven't you?

Tsuyun: The guidance of the North China National Movement is the responsibility of the New People's Society. Japanese youth, risking their lives in the most dangerous areas, are constantly working with the spirit of "Sino-Japanese friendship" and "assisting the Greater East Asia War" as their two major goals. This is a very difficult undertaking, but in fact, considerable achievements have already been obtained.

Oki: Regarding public security work, the New People's Society comes forward and carries it out with the support of the military. This is called the Public Security Enhancement Movement in North China and the "Eliminating Villages" campaign in Central China.

The Public Security Enhancement Movement in North China has progressed from the first to the fifth stage. Until the third movement, the main policy was to have the residents themselves protect their villages, or to have the love-the-railroad teams and patrol teams engage in self-defense. Shortly before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War last year, the fourth movement was launched. This time, the policy was changed to take offensive measures against the Communist army while strengthening public security.

For example, if there is an occupied village, a very deep trench must be dug in front of the village to clearly divide the area where the Communist army is active from the occupied area, and to cut off all exchange of materials and people's traffic. This method has had a great effect, making the Communist army quite stimulated, often causing sleep disturbance incidents. It seems that the fifth Public Security Enhancement Movement is currently underway. This kind of active public security work with armed force behind it is important, but the economic work and cultural work that go along with it are also quite important. In terms of economic work, the legal currency and the Lien-ho Bank notes are circulating side by side in the areas bordering the enemy. It is best not to treat the legal currency as waste paper, but to cleverly exchange it and allow the people to use it. As for cultural work, changing oil lamps to electric lights, or transporting old buses to places where there are no buses and traffic is inconvenient, and running them, etc. The New People's Society is already planning these works. However, this kind of work cannot be accomplished at once. It must be carried out patiently and slowly. The continental policy should not be rushed. We should also proceed leisurely at the pace of the continent.

Tsuyun: Looking out from the car window, you can see winding trenches. After the train has been running for several hours, you can always see the long snake-like trenches, spreading endlessly, and using the dug-up soil to form earth dikes. This can be said to be the Great Trench of Ten Thousand Li. There are passages and checkpoints everywhere in these trenches. Each checkpoint is equipped with a fortress and guarded by police guards. Anyone or anything passing through must be questioned. Inside the trench is the security area. Soon, if the neighboring village becomes a security area, the trench will also advance to the front of that village.

Oki: The Han people have a habit of thinking that it is safe to be surrounded by a city wall.

Tsuyun: That is a characteristic habit of the Han people.

Oki: The vast North China is still somewhat permeated with Communist forces. Therefore, it is an oversensitive view to think that public security cannot be maintained.

Tsuyun: The Communist army in North China did not increase only after the China Incident. Whether in Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, or Mengjiang, their numbers have been decreasing year by year because the Japanese army's mopping-up operations have been thorough. Before the Incident, Shanxi Province was a strong base for anti-Japanese Red forces. It is not difficult to understand this as long as you recognize this point. People often ask me how the public security is in North China. I always answer that it is just like Manchuria in the third or fourth year after the Manchurian Incident. At that time, people generally thought that the bandits in Manchuria could not be wiped out no matter how hard they were suppressed. Also, I say that the night train between Taiyuan and Beijing only started running for the first time on October 1st since the opening up of North China, so the rest is not difficult to imagine.

The North China Army's Vacation System and Health-Building Countermeasures

Tsuyun: Although the North China Army announced the implementation of a vacation system, no one took leave until this autumn. This is probably because they think of their comrades-in-arms on the front lines and cannot bear to return home alone. Therefore, starting this autumn, the military headquarters changed its policy and implemented mandatory vacations. Anyone who gets a vacation must return home. Only then did some people return home. Generally, the number of days for round-trip travel is included, so they can get about forty days of vacation. Many of these soldiers are of considerable age and have not yet married, so most of them return home to get married.

Oki: It's best to ask them to raise more children.

Tsuyun: On the train back to Japan, we met many officers rushing back home. For many of them, it was the first time in three and a half or four years that they had seen a train.

Reporter: By the way, please talk a little about health-building countermeasures.

Tsuyun: The so-called health-building countermeasures refer to special health facilities for the military. Since the army implemented them last year, they have been quite effective. With the improvement of hospital equipment, the number of sick soldiers has been greatly reduced. For example, in the Yuncheng hospital, since the implementation of health-building countermeasures, chest diseases have decreased by 50%, and the number of patients with infectious diseases has decreased from 160 in the year before last to 3 this year. The effect is very great. After one year of implementation, there have been various achievements, and the future of health-building countermeasures is very promising.

Appeal to the People

Reporter: Then, finally, what are your impressions from returning from the front lines?!

Tsuyun: What pained me the most on this trip to North China to offer comfort was the extreme sympathy of the front-line soldiers for the lives of the people in the rear. They are striving to lower their own living standards. At the same time, they are filled with the determination and enthusiasm to fight the Greater East Asia War to the end. The soldiers who are fighting the enemy face-to-face on the front lines are thinking about the unfreedom of the people in the rear when using a spoonful of sugar, salt, or a piece of paper. We should really thank them for their efforts and strive to conserve resources. I saw this enthusiasm and effort of the front-line soldiers with my own eyes, and I was choked with gratitude. However, as soon as I stepped into the country, the first thing I felt keenly was whether the current attitude of the people in the rear is appropriate. Is there a huge gap between the efforts of the soldiers fighting to the death on the front lines and the efforts of the people in the rear! Are the draftees and capitalists engaged in production in the country worthy of the soldiers on the front lines? On the day of welcoming the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, in response to the loyalty of the soldiers who sacrificed their precious lives for the country without regret, I hope that capitalists and laborers can abandon selfish desires and pour all their intelligence and energy into production, so that there is no shortage of weapons and ammunition, and at the same time, strive to stabilize the lives of the people in the rear, so that they can be absolutely free from worry under the bullets.

Oki: In order to repay the efforts of the front-line soldiers and the struggles of the industrial warriors in China, the people in the rear should be inspired to work hard. At the same time, the domestic guidance system should also be strengthened to establish great political work and great economic work that can guide the people.

Reporter: Thank you for your long and detailed discussion of the real situation on the front lines.

### Oil and Sugar to be Rationed Based on Population, Following Grain Rationing Method; Two Sponsoring Organizations Have Drafted Concrete Plans; Authorities Responsible for Unblocking Sources to Prevent Shortages

In order to conserve resources and suppress prices, the authorities are adopting a rationing system for essential goods. Since the implementation of the population-based grain rationing method, it has been quite effective. As for sugar and cooking oil, although the military allocation authorities allocate them to the industry control organizations, the issuance is based on house tax tickets, household registration certificates, and citizen certificates, which inevitably still have drawbacks. Situations such as counterfeiting house tax tickets and crowding have not decreased. Therefore, the authorities are planning to follow the population-based rationing method. The Sugar Merchants Cooperative and the Cooking Oil Wholesale Center have drafted concrete plans for population-based distribution and submitted them to the authorities for detailed review. At the same time, they are preparing everything. The implementation will be announced soon. It is heard that the military allocation authorities are responsible for unblocking the sources of materials to be implemented. However, it is hoped that consumers will have a full understanding of the rationing and assist in completing this good system.

Group B Oil Shops Started Selling Yesterday

In addition to preparing to implement population-based cooking oil rationing, the Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Center has divided the registered retailers in the city into two groups, A and B, before the implementation. Each group is limited to selling the allocated ten-day oil supply in rotation for four days. The Group A has already completed the sale in accordance with the established method. Group B started selling universally yesterday, and is scheduled to continue until the 29th. The amount of oil sold is one catty and a half catty, and is determined by the supervising staff. The prices are all handled according to the limited price. It is found that 19 retail cooking oil shops are designated in the Public Concession, 19 are designated in the French Concession, 15 are designated in Hongkou, 19 are designated in Nanshi, 6 are designated in Zhabei, and 14 are designated in Pudong, totaling 73 shops. The sales time is from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The oil purchase procedure is still given according to the numbered sequence. Observing the situation of each oil shop yesterday, the crowded state has not decreased.

Group A Decided to Sell Again for Four Days

After the retail shops of Group B sell until the 29th, the oil shops of Group A will continue to sell for four days from the 30th. Each retail cooking oil shop in Group A has started paying and shipping goods yesterday. What they receive is still the allocated amount for ten days. They are allowed to sell it all within four days starting from the 30th. As for the next batch of cooking oil, it will be allocated soon. Therefore, the cooking oil panic caused in this city can be eliminated. It is also hoped that residents will never buy cooking oil on the black market, and suffer losses in vain. If there are any fraudulent situations in the retail shops, they should be reported for punishment.

Oil Arriving from Other Ports Temporarily Stored at Docks

It is learned that the cooking oil shipped from Dalian and other places to Shanghai currently has 50,000 dan temporarily stored at the Huangpu Wharf. However, how to allocate it is undetermined. As for the amount of cooking oil used in this city, if it is calculated at one liang per person per day for 5 million people, it needs nearly 10,000 dan per month. The allocated amount will also be adjusted accordingly. In the future, population-based oil distribution will be done once a week, or once every half month. The amount allocated per person will also be carefully considered.

50,000 Bags of Sugar to be Distributed

The Sugar Merchants Cooperative, in view of the approaching Lunar New Year's holiday, when the need for sugar will inevitably increase, is now maintaining the proper use of sugar. It has been approved by the authorities to increase the sugar allocation for January next year to 50,000 bags, an increase of 20,000 bags compared to this month. After the general account is settled, it will obtain a transfer permit, pick up the sugar to be allocated to the various warehouses of the organization, and rush to handle the allocation procedures to advance the allocation to Grade A retailers and Grade B users.

### Proposed Increase in Household Rice Ration

It is heard that the authorities are currently negotiating to increase the amount of rice ration per household, so that it can gradually become abundant and prevent private profiteering by raising prices. It is rumored that in the near future, it will be increased to three sheng per person for several periods per month. The number of periods per month is still under discussion.

### Tax on Dividends and Interest on Shares to be Levied from Next Year

The Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance will start levying income tax on dividends and interest on shares for the years 1941 and 1942 from next year. It is currently preparing for this and plans to issue a circular to the collection bureaus in each district to follow it. As for the rumors that income tax on government bond interest will be levied at the same time, related parties have stated that due to various reasons, it may not be implemented for the time being.

### Chinese and Foreign Merchants in the Insurance Industry in Central China to Form an Association

Regarding the control organization of the insurance industry in Shanghai, it is learned that it has now been decided to merge the Japanese-owned Central China Fire Insurance Association with the foreign-owned insurance organization, the Shanghai Fire Insurance Association, and expand the scope to the entire insurance industry to organize the Central China Insurance Association. It will establish a joint committee with the Shanghai Special Municipality Insurance Trade Association, which is composed of Chinese merchants. The committee will deliberate and decide on common issues of Chinese, Japanese, and foreign insurance industries.

### Civilian Police Corps Must Hand Over Thieves Captured to the Police

The Baojia Committee of the French Concession issued a circular to the head of each Baojia district, instructing the members of the subordinate Civilian Police Corps to report to the police station in charge by telephone or hand them over to the patrol officers after capturing thieves in order to clarify the powers and avoid misunderstandings.

Smoking Prohibited on Duty

The Police Department of the French Concession issued a circular to the Civilian Police Corps members, absolutely prohibiting smoking and carrying babies while on duty. Idlers are also not allowed to enter the sentry box. The responsibilities of the Civilian Police Corps members are heavy, and they should not be treated as child's play or neglecting their duties. If violations are verified, they will be severely punished.

### Shanghai-Japan Shipping Route Fare Changes

The South China and North China Routes Remain the Same

Since the shipping in this city has been vigorously reorganized by the authorities, the Japanese shipping companies involved have added ships to enrich the shipping routes such as South China, North China, and Shanghai-Japan. However, the fares from Shanghai to various ports in Japan have recently changed. From today, the fares from Shanghai to Nagasaki are 60 yuan for first class, and 20 yuan for second class. Shanghai to Moji is 80 yuan for first class, 65 yuan for second class, and 23 yuan for third class. Shanghai to Kobe is 105 yuan for first class, 65 yuan for second class, and 21 yuan for third class. The fares for the other South China and North China routes remain the same and have not changed.

### Poverty Relief Movement

Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from reader Huang Youqing, agreeing with the New Year's poverty relief movement of not sending New Year's cards, and advocating abolishing spring banquets and collecting donations for this newspaper's poverty relief fund.

Also, because her husband is unemployed and died of illness, and she is in difficulty and has no support, a certain woman is willing to have her six-year-old orphan girl adopted by benevolent gentlemen. She is willing to write a paper to sever ties, but only as an adopted daughter. For details, please inquire with Lu Lifan of Zhonghua Store.

### Baojia District Allocates Funds to Make Clothes for Guards on Duty

In the two concessions of this city, each Baojia district feels that the self-police officers are suffering in the cold wind while guarding on duty during this severe winter. They have initiated the allocation of funds to make winter coats for the guards to wear while on duty. It is learned that districts such as Laozha have already implemented it.

Extending Day Shifts in Cotton Mills

In order to increase the production of yarn and cloth in Shanghai, Chinese and Japanese cotton mills have been assisted by the authorities and loaned by the silver and money industry. Regarding the supply of raw cotton, the Central Cotton Control Association will uniformly purchase it. Now, cotton companies in Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Shanghai, Pudong, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Changshu, and Taicang have all purchased cotton according to the specified prices. The cotton obtained will be allocated by the Control Association to various cotton mills to provide cloth for weaving. Previously, various cotton mills stopped opening night shifts and reduced spindles, looms, and cloth machines due to lack of raw materials. The working hours of day shifts were reduced to ten to eleven hours. Recently, because the raw materials have been provided, they have gradually tried to restore the normal twelve-hour day shift system, and will restore the night shift depending on the sales of yarn and cloth. Compared with October, the rate of starting work and the amount of yarn and cloth produced this month have indeed improved.

### Lending Suspended Temporarily During the Closing Period

The silver and money industry and various companies, factories, and firms are closing their accounts for the year and have started closing their accounts. (1) The banks have completed the interest settlement for savings and commercial departments and have started processing the annual final accounts. During this closing period, all loans are temporarily suspended. Lending will resume after the closing period. (2) The money houses usually close their accounts on New Year's Eve of the lunar calendar. At the end of the Gregorian calendar year, only ordinary closing of accounts is processed. As for all current loans, the repayment date is stipulated as the lunar calendar's closing period. (3) The general closing of accounts for each industry is at the end of the lunar year. However, debts owed to banks are settled when the funds are cleared, unless otherwise stipulated in the contract. In recent days, the collection and settlement of funds in each bank and money house has been particularly busy, and the money market has been tighter than usual. This is indeed the phenomenon that should occur during the closing period. The entire financial situation is still stable.

### Swapped Old Currency Deposits Can be Withdrawn Without Restriction

The Ministry of Finance implemented the final exchange of new and old currencies for the benefit of the entire public.

Bank deposits for the exchange of new and old currencies handled by the Central Reserve Bank can be withdrawn without restriction in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry.

### Shanghai-Qing Branch Political Work Corps Expands Propaganda for the New Year

Spring Couplets and Paintings are Welcome for Request

The New Year's Day of the 32nd year is approaching. The Shanghai-Qing Branch Political Work Corps, in order to implement propaganda using the New Year's holiday, has not only formulated "Expanded New Year's Propaganda Measures" to be prepared and handled by the political work teams and district propaganda teams, but also recently printed a large number of spring couplets and paintings, preparing to distribute them for pasting during the New Year. The spring couplets are printed on red paper, divided into various types for merchants, residents, large and small alleys, and so on. The words are profound and meaningful, combining celebration and propaganda. The paintings are printed in five-color rubber plates, which are extremely beautiful. They include everything that daily households paste, such as the God of Wealth and door gods. It is heard that in addition to distributing these spring couplets and paintings, the corps also welcomes requests. Anyone who writes their name, address, and the nature of their needs and sends them to the propaganda group of the corps in Fahua, Shanghai, will be sent a copy free of charge.

### Sub-Lessees Without Permits to Apply for Supplements Next Year

The Public Works Department handled the application for sublease permits by sub-lessees in the Public Concession, which ended at 4 p.m. on the 23rd. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, during this ten-day application period (from the 14th to the 23rd), the branch offices in each district received only about 10,000 applications from sub-lessees for permits, which is less than half of the 40,000 in the second phase (the second half of the 31st year). It is learned that the Sublease Housing Management Office of the Public Works Department has decided not to handle the issuance of permits before the end of this year. After the New Year's holiday, it will start collecting fees and issuing permits, and will also handle supplementary applications for those who have not yet completed the application procedures. However, at that time, these sub-lessees who delayed applying for permits will be charged a penalty for the number of days between the deadline (the 23rd) and the date of the supplementary application, calculated at one yuan per day. The permit fee is divided into two types: 18 yuan and 48 yuan. Sublease houses with 6 or more rooms are 48 yuan, and those with less than 6 rooms are 18 yuan. If they refuse to obtain a permit, or falsely claim that they do not know, once verified, in addition to fines and punishments, the Public Works Department will file a lawsuit in accordance with the law.

### Cotton in the Clearing Area is Strictly Prohibited from Being Moved; All is to Be Purchased by Designated Cotton Companies; Measures to Suppress Private Transportation are About to Be Decided

After designated cotton purchase by the Southern Jiangsu Cotton Industry Company and others in various places in Central China, cotton produced within the areas under the jurisdiction of the Southern Jiangsu Company is not allowed to be transported out privately without being purchased by the company. However, recently, the Southern Jiangsu Company discovered that large quantities of cotton were still being transported out privately. Therefore, it contacted the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction to order local investigation agencies to cooperate in suppressing the private transportation of cotton. In the clearing area, the blockade management office is responsible. All cotton produced in the clearing area is strictly prohibited from being moved. After the "Measures for Suppressing Private Transportation of Cotton" of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction are decided, cotton handled in accordance with legal procedures can be released. Therefore, cotton in the clearing area near Shanghai must be purchased under the unified control of cotton companies such as Pudong Shanghai. Regardless of quantity, it can no longer be transported out.

The application procedures for all illegal radios in the urban area of this city are handled directly by the municipal government. Those who live in the urban area (including the Shanghai West area) and intend to apply for a permit can obtain an application form from the Fifth Section of the municipal government. Correspondence is also acceptable for areas further away from the city. No fee is charged.

Public funds from various agencies have also been gradually deposited and concentrated in the bank. At the same time, after the establishment of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office, in order to stabilize finance and protect the interests of depositors, regulations require that deposit reserves be paid according to law for deposits absorbed by various banks. In recent days, the deposit reserves of various banks have been paid up, which proves that the city's finances are on the right track and becoming more stable. At the same time, in order to widely supply circulating funds to industry and commerce, the Central Reserve Bank is assisting the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications in handling large-scale lending at any time, specifically to support the development of industry and commerce and revitalize the rural economy.

### Must Carry Identification Card During Original Curfew Hours to Facilitate Police Inspection; Those Who Forget Will Be Sent to the Police Station for Questioning

The police authorities of the two concessions recently made some statements regarding the lifting of the curfew. The lifting of the curfew was originally the result of the strengthening of security agencies and the establishment of the baojia system. For several years, the security situation in this city has been quite turbulent, so the curfew was implemented to prevent petty thieves from taking advantage of the situation. Now that the baojia has been established and identity cards have been issued, the curfew is no longer necessary. However, residents must carry their issued citizen cards or residence permits with them at all times. This is especially necessary when traveling during the original curfew hours, so that police officers can inspect them at any time. Those who cannot present them during inspection will often be sent to the police station for questioning. This applies to both Chinese and foreign people alike. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention. The Public Concession lifted the curfew from September 16th of this year, while the French Concession began on the 24th of this month.

The Momentum Increased Greatly

Unfortunately, the center-back Qian was weak, making it difficult to receive passes. In the final moments, he missed many opportunities and failed to score. Although the Jewish team had scoring chances, they were repeatedly blocked by the agile Zhang Banglun. At the end of the first half, Tung Wah led 1-0. After changing sides, Tung Wah center-back Qian Zhaopeng and Shu Tang exchanged positions.

The Forwards Were Sharp

Youliang was particularly active. The Jewish team's defense was under pressure. In the 18th minute, Adai broke through Shaman and passed to Youliang. Youliang used a little skill to dribble past Mannia and score. Two minutes later, Long Mei attacked and hit the woodwork again, and the ball bounced into the net. In the 30th minute, Youliang received assistance from Adai again, broke through Shaman, and lightly tapped the ball into the goal in front of the goal. Tung Wah scored three consecutive goals, leading 4-0. The Jewish team fought like cornered beasts. Schnall went deep, and Youren unfortunately committed a handball. Schnall executed the penalty kick and scored. The Jewish team pulled back a goal. At that time, Mannia was transferred to center-back and tried a long shot from 30 yards away. Banglun did not defend, and the ball entered the net. As a result, Tung Wah won 4-2.

### Under the Iron Birds: A Japanese Air Force Maintenance Soldier's Memoir, Translated from the December Issue of Aviation Culture

Flight Preparation

The sound of "Wake up!" shattered my dreams of longing for my hometown. I, who was accustomed to the warmth of the heated kang (platform bed), put on my oil-stained work clothes and got out of bed.

It was 00:00 on Month ○, Day ○, Year Showa ○. I had gone to bed at 10 p.m. last night and had only slept for two hours. This short amount of sleep was not enough to recover from yesterday's fatigue.

When I went outside, there was no wind. It was the middle of Month ○○, and the cold of Mengjiang invaded my bones. The sky was twinkling with stars, a perfect clear weather for bombing.

Our maintenance squad jumped into a truck and passed through the city gate, which was guarded amicably by Japanese and Mongolian soldiers. We drove along the withered ginkgo tree-lined road toward the airfield. In the deep silence of the night, only the sound of the truck engine reverberated.

Born in a warm country, I really couldn't stand the cold of minus twenty-odd degrees Celsius. I turned up the collar of my work clothes and saw my breath condensed on the anti-frost mask, already frozen as white as frost. The cold also seeped into my cotton work gloves, penetrating the stiff fingers to the bone. The truck slowed down on the uneven road. Fearing that I would be thrown off the truck, I tightly held onto the strap on the work clothes of a soldier in front of me, while resisting the sleepiness that was attacking me, continuing that pitiful effort in the truck. As the car crossed the railway line and made a large turn to the left, it was clear that we had arrived at the silent airfield with the winged aircraft.

After jumping out of the truck, our maintenance squad members began their respective tasks. Some lit fires to heat the lubricating oil, some fanned the stove with pieces of wood to quickly make the charcoal fire blaze, and others were busy removing the airplane covers. The work of the mechanics was truly dizzying.

"We must bomb ○zhou at dawn tomorrow, so the maintenance squad must complete the flight preparations before ○:00 a.m.," this was the task assigned to us last night. "Swiftly and surely," we must complete our task within the prescribed time under any circumstances.

As soon as the stove was burning brightly, we carried it with poles, moved it into the curtain covering the engine, and began to heat the engine. In the curtain, we carefully watched the gradually warming engine, while wiping away the drops of lubricating oil that melted due to the heat with a cloth. The work was originally interesting, but after the body warmed up, sleepiness began to bother me. In this way, if one was not careful, there was a danger of being poisoned and collapsing from the filled carbon fire gas. Although the fire extinguisher was placed nearby, it was important not to be careless when placing fire under gasoline.

I entrusted another soldier to watch the charcoal fire and crawled out of the curtain, starting to inspect the airframe by the faint light. The metal aircraft hull was very cold, and touching it with my fingers felt like they would freeze off. The areas that had been inspected yesterday must now be carefully inspected again. From the main wing to the fuselage to the tail, even the slightest crack could have a significant impact on the aircraft's stability and speed.

"A single spark can start a prairie fire. Even the smallest detail can cause a tragic incident. If there is any negligence, resulting in the loss of a promising airman, how regrettable would that be?"

While gently stroking the aircraft's hull with my fingers, I carefully inspected it all around. There were no abnormalities anywhere, the shock struts were in good condition, and the tire pressure was solid.

The engine was mostly heated. I tried turning the propeller by hand, and it was able to turn lightly. This meant that a little lubricating oil needed to be added, so I hurried to the place where the lubricating oil was being heated, stepping on the frozen sand with a "crackle, crackle" sound, and returned carrying the lubricating oil, looking exactly like a farmer carrying a fertilizer bucket.

Holding a funnel, I stood on the wing of the aircraft. At this time, the cold wind blowing from the Ordos Plateau blew on my ears, as if it would cut them off. No, it wasn't cold, it was pain. After the lubricating oil was added, I moved out the stove, removed the engine cover, and prepared to test the engine. "Starting up" in the winter is very difficult. Although the engine had been heated, it was still not easy to get it to turn. To make starting easier, I used my hand to turn the propeller. Because it was a three-blade propeller, it took three turns to make it rotate once.

Humming the sound of "Hang yo! Hang yo!" I cranked the propeller five to eight times, and my body gradually warmed up. After fifteen to twenty times, I was panting non-stop, and my legs were swaying, unable to stand. If someone with only ordinary strength were to do it, they probably wouldn't be able to continue after cranking three times.

When I saw the engine supervisor constantly turning the electric light on and off to signal the ignition command, after loudly replying "Ignition," I quickly waved the electric light I was carrying in a large circle three or four times. Then, after the propeller slowly turned two or three times, it emitted a "pa-la! pa-la!" popping sound and began to turn violently. Doing an "engine test" or "start-up" on the ground at night is the most dangerous thing. One careless mistake could damage the propeller. At this time, one had to endure the sleepy, tired eyes and carefully watch the condition of the rotating engine. It was truly unbearable pain!

One must keep one's eyes open and ears listening to the constantly changing sounds of explosions, from slow speed to medium speed to high speed, as well as the richness of the exhaust and the presence or absence of vibrations. If any abnormality occurred, one must immediately know where the problem was, or one could not be called a qualified engine mechanic. Needless to say, becoming such an engine mechanic requires indispensable experience, effort, and a diligent spirit of research.

The engine test was completed, and the results were excellent. I hurried to report to the engine supervisor.

Departure for Bombing

Opening the warehouse filled with bombs, I relied on the dim light of the work lamp to carry out a ○○-kilogram bomb and suspend it on the aircraft. A bomb of this weight could easily be suspended by three people. But normally, suspending a ○○-kilogram bomb is done using machines. To save every second and not waste time, we carried it by manpower to suspend it. In the narrow and low bomb bay, carrying out many ○○-kilogram bombs, with only seven people, each bent over to carry them, all looked a bit unable to bear the hardship. However, if one person slacked off at this time, it would be terrible. If a bomb were to fall, not to mention being injured, one's life would be in danger.

Once the ○○ bombs were suspended, we only waited for departure. With the concerted efforts of all the comrades, the work was done quickly and smoothly, step by step. In this way, flight preparations were declared complete.

As soon as I finished putting away the airplane covers, I stood in front of the airplane and prayed, "Airplane! I wish you a safe flight!" Before long, one by one, the air warriors arrived, dressed in their tan flight suits.

"Not expecting to return alive," this is the state of mind that airmen have whenever they board an airplane! I watched their tense faces, and a wave of unknown heat surged into my own face.

"I wish you all a good job and a safe return!"

"Thank you!"

Unconsciously, I ran up to them and shook hands tightly with them one by one, looking at each other intently. In this instant, we were no longer airmen or ground crew, nor were we officers or non-commissioned officers or soldiers. Transcending all ranks, there was only the bright red tide of blood flowing between the tightly clasped hands that was fueling the Yamato race.

Ah! What a grateful and solemn scene this was! The stars were weeping, the wind was weeping, and our tears of gratitude flowed drop by drop, seeping into the frozen Mengjiang soil.

In this way, our aircraft approached the departure line. At this time, all of us ground crew members lined up and sent our blessings from the bottom of our hearts as they embarked on this grand journey.

With the "rumbling" sound of the engine, the airplane taxied out, facing the wind, three hundred meters, four hundred meters, five hundred meters, gradually rising into the sky. This was a night formation takeoff, which was not common.

I stood in the airfield until I could no longer see the formation lights, forgetting the cold, and wishing them success from the bottom of my heart.

Beloved Aircraft Returning

It was late Month ○, Year Showa ○. In this ○○ place, the mornings and nights were very cold, and the days were slightly warmer. Between the withered grasses on the airfield, it seemed as if the sprouts of tender grass had emerged, somewhat comforting my war-weary heart.

After moving the bombs and fuel in preparation for the next bombing, I lay down next to an oil drum while the aircraft had not yet returned, looking up at the clear blue sky.

At nightfall, on the mountaintop across from the side where the defeated soldiers lights could be seen, there still seemed to be patches of snow, while on the other side of the airfield, heat haze shimmered, and a lark was singing somewhere. It was a day in early spring.

As if shattering this serene environment, the battle command post suddenly became lively. I hurried over and asked a soldier I knew:

"Hey! What happened?"

"Hmm! Two aircraft from ○ Squadron seem to have self-detonated."

"Really?" At this moment, I felt as if I had been struck hard on the head, and I couldn't speak for a moment.

It was a heroic self-detonation. In my mind, the heroic figures of the *arawashi* (translator's note: meaning fierce eagle, the term the Japanese used for their pilots) sitting in aircraft spewing fire and charging into enemy positions, and their smiling faces at the time of departure, swirled like a revolving lantern, and I couldn't help but sob!

A faint engine sound seemed to be carried by the breeze. I quickly looked towards the distant mountain range shrouded in the sunset glow. I saw the aircraft, one, two, three, flying over in formation, one after another, not as if they had been through a fierce aerial battle.

What about the aircraft in the majestic formation clearly reflected in my eyes? Ah! Here it comes, here it comes. Flying leisurely behind its companions, returning, it wasn't the aircraft...

I couldn't help but wave my work cap and shout "Banzai!" At this time, cheers from here and there rang out like thunder, and the shouts echoed towards the mountains opposite us.

After the formation circled once over the airfield, they dispersed and landed one after another. My gaze followed my beloved aircraft flying along the side of Mount Shizan, waiting for its turn to land.

Once the engine mechanic sees the aircraft enter his field of vision, he cannot take his eyes off it for a moment until it lands on the ground.

Before long, the aircraft finally extended its landing gear, nose down, and took a landing posture, gliding down from the sky and reaching the ground. I guided with both hands, and the propeller stopped turning as soon as the aircraft was in front of me. I quickly opened the aircraft door and shouted "Well done, well done" from the bottom of my heart to the returning warriors, congratulating them, while my heart was filled with indescribable joy.

We immediately crawled under the wings of the aircraft after it landed. Whether airmen or mechanics, everyone checked the bullet holes on the aircraft body. Thankfully, it had not been hit by a single bullet. It was said that dozens of A-15 and A-16 aircraft, which the enemy boasted were elite, had engaged in fierce combat, with anti-aircraft guns below firing continuously, but the aircraft had managed to return safely without being hit by a single bullet. This was nothing more than the result of the shooter's excellent and skillful technique, the pilot's outstanding flying skills, and the great spiritual strength they had produced.

The bombing was completed, and the aircraft had returned to base, but our mission was not yet over. No, it was only going to get busier from now on. Adding fuel and lubricating oil, as well as the post-flight inspection, had to be done one by one. There was also tomorrow's flight preparations that needed to be completed.

"Engine Supervisor, how were the results?" This was the question that we engine mechanics were most concerned about. If the aircraft had to make an emergency landing or return halfway due to defects in maintenance, it would be the most disgraceful thing for an engine mechanic.

"Hmm, hmm, the results were good, well done." How happy would we feel when the engine supervisor said that?

After the various refueling and inspection tasks were completed, it was time to clean the aircraft. We poured the remaining gasoline from the bottom of the oil drums into iron cans and used cloths dipped in gasoline to wipe the airframe. Although it was Month ○, when the weather had already warmed up, gasoline was colder than water. We had to endure this cold, and from the bottom of the airplane to the wing, we wiped it while shouting to summon strength, thus forgetting the cold.

Even a small amount of lubricating oil, sand, or dust on the aircraft can reduce the flight speed by ○ kilometers. Outsiders would not believe this. Whenever the engine mechanics had free time, they would clean the aircraft. Perfect maintenance and a clean airframe were the greatest glory for an engine mechanic.

After cleaning, we covered the aircraft with airplane covers and left it in the field. In this way, we completed the preparations for tomorrow, and at the same time, our task for today was also completed.

Missing Wingman

After completing my own work, I happened to walk over to ○ Squadron to take a look.

Ah! What a tragic scene it was!

The engine mechanics of the aircraft that had self-detonated over there were holding the wheel chocks in their hands, quietly standing and gazing at the western sky where the sun was setting, searching for the traces of their aircraft that could not return.

We, filled with joy, and they, with their chests filled with sorrow, were truly a cruel contrast!

Finally, they also knew that they could not find them. So, with helpless hands, they folded up the now useless airplane covers. They kept wiping their faces with the sleeves of their work clothes. They were probably crying. The heroic self-detonation had resulted in those maintenance soldiers shedding tears of mourning!

I piously prayed for the peace of those *arawashi* who had already turned into dewdrops of the ○○ air raid, and at the same time, I expressed my sympathy from the bottom of my heart.

Two or three crows were flying back to their nests, and the western sky, whether it was a coincidence or not, was exceptionally red today. (Translated by 才)

Due to the settlement process, the government bond market has been officially closed early. There are no market prices today and further discussion will await the New Year.

### Eastern Cloth Sales Brisk, Prices All Rising

The market for factory cloth continued to be firm, but there were few transactions. Because the end of the year is near, the appetite of the trade here is also weak. However, the supply of goods is still tight, so 16-pound Earth Brand coarse cloth requires 286 yuan; 12-pound Earth Brand fine cloth, 193.5 to 4 yuan; Magnolia bleached cloth, 213 yuan; Qin Liangyu, 202 yuan; Qin Beauty Yuan Cloth, 204 yuan; Mermaid Yuan Twill, 203 yuan; Three Peacock Yuan Twill, 191 yuan; Longevity Fuchou, 8.50 yuan; Three Sheep Serge, 6.95 yuan; Peach Lady Silk, 314.50 yuan; Chickadee Silk, 314 yuan; and Chickadee An'an Blue, 265 yuan, all had sales.

### Summer Woolens Most Popular, Demand for Heavy Woolens Declining

Summer woolens, such as white Biji, white Zhigong, Paris, Feather Yarn Wool, Thick Skin, All Over Top, French Wool, Linen Canvas, etc., can be said to be the most popular in the woolen market recently. The market situation is far more expensive than other goods. The owners are particularly hoarding, and the number of those seeking is very large, because their inventory is limited. The factory production is decreasing rather than increasing, so the industry is optimistic. Yesterday, double yellow edge white Biji sold for 210 yuan, good Huarongkang white Zhigong 300 yuan, Meifa Paris 167.5 yuan, Yihe Feather Yarn Wool 160 yuan, Friendship French Wool 295 yuan, and Gongdaquan linen cloth 8.5 yuan in military notes.

As for heavy woolen goods, although daily sales are still not deserted, their demand for purchases and handling, due to environmental reasons, has been declining on all sides. (1) Overcoat woolens are divided into many types, roughly divided into four grades: (A) Boiling Water and Hair Woolens are entirely from abroad. According to the authorities' price limit, each yard can only be sold for 1,000 yuan. However, the market is divided into two categories: Western goods are sold for 1,350 yuan to 1,780 yuan, while Eastern goods are sold for 900 yuan to 1,230 yuan. Goods are quite scarce and the demand from buyers cannot be found without knowing the familiar runners and brokers, because the owners are doing secret black market deals. (B) Engraved Flower and Herringbone Woolens: the market price per yard is mostly the same as the limited price, which is 750 yuan, and the trend is not as popular as type A. (C) Herringbone, Plaid, Solid Color, and Twill, etc., have smooth and pure wool, and black and gray colors are the most popular. The selling price is mostly from 320-30 yuan to 450-60 yuan per yard. Among them, Meifeng goods are the best-selling, as they are imported goods. The limited price is 440 yuan, and the selling price is only 360-70 yuan. This kind of heavy woolen is the most popular. (D) That is, Viero and inferior mixed goods are sold to lower-end customers, and the selling price ranges from 120-30 yuan to about 200 yuan. (2) Flat Thick Woolens come mostly from Poland. The goods are extremely scarce at the moment, so the price is also very high. Dark blue has been out of stock for a long time, and the average price for thick goods is estimated to be 300 yuan, and for thin goods, around 200 yuan. (3) Melton, dark blue has mostly sold out, leaving only the original color. Polish goods are sold for 110-20 yuan to 140 yuan, and goods from this factory are sold for 80 yuan to 100 yuan.

### Sparse Grain Transactions

The sources of grain have not been smooth, so transactions are sparse and the market is still firm. Yesterday, more than ten packages of Chongming sand red opened at a price of 350 yuan, and eight packages of Shawang at 270 yuan, Mingguang tea bean pods at 365 yuan, 50 packages of Jiangbei raw peanuts at 750 yuan, one truck of Fei brand bean cake at 84.5 yuan, and three trucks of Yuanlong bean cake at 84 yuan to 84.5 yuan.

### Difficult to Get a Good Price for Ordinary Fragrant Mushrooms

Ordinary Fujian fragrant mushrooms, because their caps are small, the crumbs are heavy, the color is not good, and they have spots, so it is difficult to get a good price. Yesterday, the customer goods opened a batch, which was a quarter worse than good goods. However, deducting the crumbs, the combined price is still high, so the market has not changed much.

### Price Talk for Orchid Bamboo Branches, Buying and Selling Still Far Apart

The cost of the orchid bamboo branches arriving this time is mostly higher than before, but the price in the Shanghai market is lower, so they have not been traded in the past few days. There was another price talk by a number of firms in the northern market yesterday, but it did not succeed due to the large difference between the two sides. It can be seen that the owners are still unwilling to sell too cheaply.

### Northern Goods Gradually Loosening, Northern Exchange Rate Extended, Arrival of Goods More Abundant

The market situation of northern goods, due to the extension of the northern exchange rate and the more abundant arrival of goods, and the extraordinary tightening of funds, has led to sluggish real sales, and the market situation has suddenly become looser. At the moment, the red dates from Dusheng at the head of the market are 700 yuan, the date heads are 750 yuan, the date jade is sold for 800 yuan, and the big date king is sold for 850 yuan. The red dates from Cangzhou's secondary households are sold for 700 yuan, the date heads are 720-30 yuan, the date kings are 770-80 yuan, and the big date kings are sold for 820-30 yuan. The unified red dates are sold for 750 yuan, and the Fu red dates are sold for 360 yuan, and the long red dates are sold for 200 yuan.

The price of persimmon cakes at the place of origin has risen, and the market is very stable. At the moment, Qing cakes are sold for 400 yuan, Taier cakes are sold for 410 yuan, Geng cakes are sold for 460 yuan, and row cakes are sold for 430 yuan. The market is looking up. Black dates, Boping top high grade, 950 yuan, second high grade sold for 850 yuan, unified hand sold for 750 yuan, Jinan black date heads 750 yuan, more skillful hand sold for 650 yuan, second choice sold for 550 yuan.

The walnut market has loosened up. At the moment, the hand-picked peaches are sold for 800 yuan, Changping peaches are sold for 700 yuan, Guanli peaches are sold for 800 yuan, southern peaches are 480 yuan, Ti peaches are 500 yuan, Jinan peach kings are 1,300 yuan, peach slices are sold for 1,500 yuan, Yangyi peach jade are 1,100 yuan, and Qingzhou peach jade are 1,200 yuan.

### Someone Buying Coarse Sand Shares

The sugar shares of the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office have been sluggish recently due to the scarcity of buying and selling. The lowest price of coarse sand shares is less than 285 yuan. Now that someone is absorbing them, they have recovered. The office has opened at 290 yuan, and even reached 292-3 yuan. Transactions in red sand shares are still lacking.

### British and American Tobacco Distributing Goods Continuously

The cigarette market is gradually falling back, because British and American affordable cigarettes are continuing to be distributed quickly. In addition, the recent tightening of funds and the approach of the end of the year have caused buyers to wait and see, so prices have been falling. The prices of British brands such as British Flag at 9,150 yuan, Old Knife at 8,250 yuan, Pinhai at 7,500 yuan, Fairy at 7,150 yuan, and Five Flowers at 6,000 yuan, Japanese cigarettes such as Gold Gun at 2,800 yuan, Golden Building at 3,150 yuan, Red Rose at 2,550 yuan, All Luck at 2,900 yuan, Nian Zhi at 2,850 yuan, Guide at 2,350 yuan, National Cigarettes such as Pyramid at 6,300 yuan, Beautiful at 5,650 yuan, and Golden Mouse at 2,750 yuan, White Gold Dragon at 3,850 yuan, are all lower than before by 100 to 200 yuan.

### Daily Necessities Supply and Demand Quiet

The market for daily necessities is quiet in terms of supply and demand, and market prices remain stable. Phoenix brand matches are priced at 2900 yuan, Beauty brand at 3150 yuan, Golden Tripod at 2800 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 2350 yuan, Guben soap at 515 yuan, Bai Xiangmao at 480 yuan, Huang Xiangmao at 400 yuan, scissors at 500 yuan, Price's Candles at 420 yuan, wool hats at 360 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 250 yuan.

### Narrow Strip Steel Market Bounces

Two hundred pounds of American narrow strip steel, which had been scarce on the market, suddenly saw activity yesterday as can factories, toy factories, and printing factories on this street scrambled for it. The businesses of the iron shops also stirred, and the previously quiet market experienced a bounce, regaining a lively atmosphere. Operators' confidence rose, and standard market prices became brisk. Currently, 200-pound mixed color boxes are selling for 1,500 yuan each. Sorted colors require 1,600-1,700 yuan per box, depending on the size. Retail sales are between eight and ten yuan per pound.

### Strong Demand for Large Guangdong Leather Sheets, Difficult to Find Spot Goods

36-foot large Guangdong leather sheets are scarce on the market. In recent days, inquiries from dealers have surged, and vacuum bottle manufacturers, can factories, and tinplate printing plants are also showing keen interest in wholesale purchases. However, transactions are difficult to complete, presenting a "available price but no product" scenario. Those holding the goods are confident and raising prices, and standard market quotes are becoming brisker. Currently, the market price is around 21,000 yuan per ton. Due to the inability to purchase large quantities, many factories have switched to buying substitute goods such as sub-standard goods, low-quality goods, and 2,000-pound black iron billets. As a result, the prices of these items have also been driven up.

### On Valuing "Money"

— Le Jian

On December 12th, this publication carried an article by Mr. Tuosi titled "Praises and Criticisms of Money." After reading it, I felt that it praised money more than it criticized it, so I still believe in the benefits of "money" and thus write this "On Valuing Money."

"With money, all things are possible." These few words are enough to express that money is above all else. Today is an era where only the wealthy can survive! How can we still use the term "tainted money" to curse the rich? Mr. Zhang made a speculative investment and suddenly became rich. His wife, beaming with joy, invited friends to go dancing. Mr. Zhang happened to bring his girlfriend along, and they were introduced to each other, laughing and joking! Boss Li admired the immense wealth of a certain young master and was willing to marry his daughter to him as the sixth concubine. Manager Wang used company funds to hoard a batch of goods, pocketed the profits, and claimed that the company had no surplus, naturally preventing employees from receiving bonuses. All such things are prone to causing trouble and displeasure. However, because of money, major issues are reduced to minor ones, and minor issues disappear altogether. For the sake of money, conflicts are resolved peacefully, and the world is at peace. The power of money is indeed great!

As for the old sayings "money can move gods," "money can make the devil turn the millstone," and "a penny can kill a hero"... these are all clear instructions for me to value money. Once money is in hand, even ascending to the throne is easy, not to mention minor matters such as riding a charcoal car, marrying a popular actress as a concubine, or buying a foreign-style house. Because of the importance of "money," the means of earning it can be somewhat ruthless. There is a saying in our countryside: "If you want to get rich, you must squeeze the poor!" This is the surest way to get rich. Today, there are even more methods of "squeezing." Making a fortune through speculation is the latest style because speculation indirectly squeezes the poor, not directly. It is a bloodless killing method that will not even make oneself a little "shudder." As for those who only exploit their subordinates to supply their own needs and do not think about earning other people's money, they are practitioners of the inferior technique of "squeezing."

Once a person becomes wealthy, the foolish become wise, the inferior rise to excellence, and the dead are revived. That is to say, wealthy people naturally experience "good fortune and inspiration." Therefore, it is permissible to let your son wander because as long as the father has money to leave him, he will eventually "return to the right path." Even if he commits murder, it can be resolved with "money." We spend our days running around for food and clothing, hearing everyone in the streets and alleys lamenting the scarcity of money and envying others' wealth. If there is still someone who thinks that "money" is unnecessary and that it is an evil thing, then that person must be extremely poor and miserly, without a doubt.

Conversely, there have been many people in the past who looked down on "money." Confucius, who advocated "gentlemen being poor," praised Yan Hui, who lived a beggar-like life with "a single basket of rice, a gourd of water, and sleeping with his arm as a pillow in a humble alley" and still did not change his happiness. Yang Zhen refused "night-time gold," and Lu Bao wrote "On Money as a God" to observe the world. Huang Tingjian severed ties with "Brother Copper Coin," and Wang Yan referred to money as "that thing," not even mentioning the word "money." Tao Qian refused to bow for five pecks of rice, and Zhu Bolu advised people not to eat unexpected wealth... But they were all unfashionable figures of the past, and their lack of love for money was not expressed with any systematic theory. People, besides considering them "eccentric," also laughed at them as foolish and out of touch with the times.

Today, the concept of enjoying life is strong, and the functionality of "money" is even more developed. These poor scholars who are "content with poverty and find joy in the Way" are even less worthy of emulation. Even those ancient people, reborn in this world, would only be regarded as bookworms. Shaw said that money is the most important thing in the world, and Lu Xun believed that anyone who said money was despicable must still have undigested fish and meat in his stomach. This clear and sharp statement is precisely because Shaw and Lu Xun were modern people, not ancient people from hundreds of years ago. Therefore, they are not seen as poor scholars by modern people and do not detract from their status as "great writers."

Finally, I hope that everyone will fast and bathe and take advantage of the end of the year to go to the Temple of the God of Wealth to burn incense, in order to obtain wealth and good fortune in the coming year.

The day before yesterday, with a hopeful and joyful heart, I went to the Jinyuan Pawnshop in Ruyi Lane, Henan Road, to apply for a loan. Before reaching my destination, I hesitated a bit because my clothes were not very presentable. Would I encounter the same contempt and scorn as before? But when I mustered the courage to go, my doubts disappeared. The person in charge was so kind and approachable. They sympathetically inquired about the situation of each loan applicant. There were none of the snobbish faces of typical capitalists or the cursed mercenary spirit of merchants. Instead, one could see the sparks of warmth and the virtues of humanity! After each loan applicant received an application form and a guarantee, they left with satisfaction. Now, we only need to undergo the pawnshop's investigation, and we can borrow a small amount of capital. Although the loan amount is not very large, we can use it for legitimate business and maintain our livelihood!

Now, a truly good deed has been opened in the pawnshop industry, which is so worthy of praise! We believe that there are too many capitalists and wealthy people in Shanghai. If everyone can rise up and emulate the Yuyuan Pawnshop and make this kind of good deed as widespread as possible, so that every poor person can benefit from it, it will certainly erase the vivid picture of hell in Shanghai! This kind of welfare undertaking that solves the panic of the unemployed and brings social tranquility is worthy of doing! Isn't it a hundred times more meritorious than shouting "charity" from the mouth?

I hope that the kind people, capitalists, and wealthy merchants in mansions will all extend their charitable hands to do true "charity"!

### Sentiments of a Small-Loan Recipient

— Di Wu

The raging waves of life mercilessly strike every poor person, turning the back of this prosperous city into an icehouse. It is indeed not easy to survive in these times!

Due to the changes of the times, the number of unemployed people is increasing in batches. Although the surface of the city is still prosperous and splendid, this deformed development has further created a state where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Unemployment and survival, this immense threat, can only be understood by us poor people! In this snobbish and dark society, where can we find bread?

I am a commoner who has tasted the bitterness of unemployment. Although I have a pair of hands that can work, although I have some skills for life, and although I am willing to endure hardship, who will pity me, pay attention to me, and help me? Since becoming unemployed, I have been living a life of torment every day. I wanted to ask for help from some wealthy people, but all I received was contempt and scorn! I thought of committing suicide several times out of weakness, but then I thought that I have blood like iron and perseverance like steel, so why can't I live? And I also thought that there must not be only cold-blooded people in humanity! Therefore, in addition to actively working hard, I also dare to live. I believe that commoners like me are struggling and waiting in the icehouse of this city!

Isn't that right? There are also good deeds being done in the pawnshop industry in Shanghai, such as providing small loans to commoners! When I saw the news of the Jinyuan Pawnshop lending money in the newspaper, I was quite surprised. I doubted the accuracy of this news, but I immediately realized that this cannot be generalized. This is clearly a fact, clearly good news for us poor people! I am sincerely happy for the unemployed in general and grateful for the poor in general!

### Sailing in the Same Storm

— He Jia Zhi

— Melody from the Imperial Garden—

With the skill of Huang Long, such a stab would either pierce Chen Guoqi's throat or Chen Guofang's shoulder. However, the result was not as they expected. The knife tip only pierced the soft quilt. Reaching out to feel around, there were blankets and pillows on the bed, but no one. This stab had no effect whatsoever. Huang Long and Wei Cheng were both surprised and immediately moved away from the bed. Wei Cheng said, "Why is there no one on the bed?" Huang Long said, "Quick, go to the next room. If one didn't work out, we can't let her go easily." Wei Cheng moved his steps and walked into a room with light. He peered inside with half his face and saw Chen Guofang, Miss Chen, lying on the bed. Although her face was the same shape as her brother Chen Guoqi's, her red lips and cheeks that looked like they were wearing rouge would never mistake her for Chen Guoqi. Wei Cheng's thoughts surged faster than electricity. A thought came to mind, and he took a step forward. Huang Long, needless to say, followed closely behind Wei Cheng. He placed the knife in Wei Cheng's hand. Wei Cheng raised his hand, only as high as his shoulder, not as high as his head, and then his hand trembled.

Huang Long saw it very clearly. He snatched the knife from Wei Cheng's hand and stabbed Chen Guofang, who was breathing steadily, again. At this critical moment, who could save the poor Chen Guofang from this impending doom? But, but, but, just as the knife was about to strike, an arm suddenly blocked Chen Guofang's throat, preventing the knife from stabbing straight down. Could an arm stop a knife? Especially a knife held in Huang Long's hand. The stab went down, and the arm went down with it. Huang Long shouted "Oh," knowing that the arm belonged to Wei Cheng. The knife and the arm struck the edge of the bed together, which naturally shook the bed. Chen Guofang suddenly opened her eyes and blinked several times. This was another critical moment. Wei Cheng puffed out a mouthful of air from his mouth and blew out the kerosene lamp in front of the bed with a "poof," and then pulled Huang Long back with all his might. Huang Long retreated along the same path he had come in, and Wei Cheng also reached the outside. The knife was in Wei Cheng's hand. They didn't hear any sound from the room. When they reached the gate, Huang Long grabbed Wei Cheng's chest.

### Darwin's Letter on a Subject (Part 1)

—Lincoln Schugter, Translated by Gu Xin

—One of the Letters of World-Famous Scientists—

Foreword: In this letter, the author of "On the Origin of Species" offers some friendly opinions on several scientific studies, such as research on butterflies, dragonflies, and the sexual selection of Malays. We can steal a peek from Darwin's (Charles Darwin's) shoulder and see clearly how this great scientist, with his highest talent, is indeed engaged in a particular problem.

Darwin said that his success was largely due to the following traits: "A love of science: prolonged consideration in any subject, with unlimited patience: diligent observation and matter-of-factness: rich inventiveness and the willingness to labor diligently, freeing my mind in order to abandon any speculation, no matter how much I love it (I cannot help but form a speculation on every subject), as soon as I discover that it is inconsistent with the facts, I immediately abandon it."

The foundation of Darwin's scientific success was his famous voyage, when he, as a naturalist, studied the Beagle Islands and then, from 1831 to 1836, traveled through Tahiti, New Zealand, St. Helena, Brazil, and the Azores. When he returned in 1837, he had taken many notes in his notebook on the changes of species. In 1836, while he was traveling (when he was just twenty years old), he was greatly moved by seeing the character of South American leaves in the Galapagos Archipelago.

In 1838, Darwin first noticed "special evidence of the struggle for existence" and was deeply impressed by the following fact: "Suitable changes can be preserved, and unsuitable changes will be eliminated." He felt that such a result was the formation of new species. Therefore, he had the idea of "continuous divergence."

On January 11, 1844, Darwin wrote: "Finally, the light is gradually revealed, and I am almost convinced (contrary to my initial opinion) that species are not (this is tantamount to admitting a murder) immutable."

In 1856, he was about to publish his basic research on evolution, but he received a manuscript of a paper from Wallace (A. R. Wallace), another great naturalist and also an authority on the various lives on the Malay Archipelago. Wallace was seeking Darwin's opinion. Darwin was greatly surprised when he saw the paper, as what was said in it seemed to be completely extracted from his own theory. Therefore, he followed the advice of many scientists at the time and, in July 1858, submitted a collaborative paper to the Linnaean Society: "On the Tendency of Species to Form Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection."

### On "Speaking"

— Jie Ren

The differences in people's natural talents are rarely greater than in the skill of speaking. The skill of speaking, like other things, must be cultivated through dedicated effort.

The English politician Temple once said: "The first element of excellent conversation is truth, the second is clarity, the third is joy, and the fourth is wit." Some words are like the rays of the sun, but some words are like the poisoned arrows of the Emperor, and if harsh words penetrate so deeply, how can gentle words bring joy to people?

The person who speaks the most is not necessarily the most eloquent person. Speaking should be the use of the brain, not just the use of the tongue. When people are caught up in conversation, they often say inappropriate or completely wrong things. This is because they love to talk, and they have no other purpose than to use their tongue. This kind of unrestrained and verbose talk is a contributing factor to most of the troubles and disasters in our lives, and it can even be said to be an obstacle to success. It is enough to arouse the anger of the person being talked about, and it will quickly sow the seeds of struggle among others, and it can also ignite small suspicions and minor gaps, which, if left to their own devices, can disappear on their own. The reason why human beings have two ears and one mouth is to tell you to speak less and listen more!
