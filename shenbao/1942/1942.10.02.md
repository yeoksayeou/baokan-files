### Fierce Fighting Between German and Soviet Troops for Volga Fortress; Soviet Tank Units Launch Counter-Offensives North and South of the City Amidst Heavy Fire

Allied News Agency, Stockholm, 1st

News from Moscow received here today acknowledges that Stalingrad, on the banks of the Volga River, is facing an even greater threat from German forces. The situation remains dire, with German troops slowly advancing through the ruins of the city. However, the Soviet defenders are showing great determination. According to Reuters Moscow, German tanks in the factory district northwest of the city are advancing, followed by relentless bombing that is making the situation at the Volga River docks extremely tense. German artillery is also concentrating its fire on the narrow central area of the city day and night in an attempt to breach it, no matter how small the opening, to allow German infantry and light machine gunners to pass through. Among the German reinforcements recently deployed to the front lines of Stalingrad are two infantry divisions and one tank division. Fighting is also taking place on the vast plains northwest of Stalingrad, bordering the Don River. German forces have been launching a full-scale assault on Stalingrad for the sixth week. This morning, the city was shrouded in smoke and flames, with large formations of German aircraft soaring overhead, dropping bombs. Soviet forces are launching attacks in the south and north of the city in an attempt to relieve German pressure, making the war even more intense. However, German artillery is employing rapid-action tactics to contain the offensive of General Timoshenko's Soviet forces. Soviet tank assaults have repeatedly been repelled by artillery fire. German forces in the northern part of Stalingrad have made slight gains in the Benzotop region. There is little news regarding developments on the extreme southern front, but Moscow reports that Moscow Radio has reported that the fighting has intensified in the Mozdok region of Eastern Caucasus as the German side has transferred reserve forces.

Today's German military report stated that fierce fighting for high ground is taking place in the Caucasus region. German aircraft are assisting our forces in Stalingrad in penetrating the northern part of the city. Enemy infantry and tank units launching fierce attacks on German positions north of the city have been dealt a heavy blow, losing 98 tanks, mostly of British and American manufacture.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 1st

According to Associated Press Moscow, German forces have recently been using their latest tactics in the northern part of Stalingrad: a large number of small tanks charging forward, followed by heavily armored vehicles full of machine guns making fierce breakthroughs. Soviet defenders and citizen militias continue to resist stubbornly with hand grenades and Molotov cocktails, but ultimately they are forced to retreat due to the vast disparity in strength. Moreover, Moscow Radio reported that the Stalingrad defenders are determined to resist to the end, vowing never to retreat, even if they are reduced to the last street corner, the last house, and the last drop of blood.

### Colonel Tani Ogi Delivers Speech on the Greater East Asia War

Central News Agency, Mito, 1st

Colonel Tani Ogi Nahao, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a military speech at the Ibaraki Hall here yesterday, titled "How to Complete the Greater East Asia War." The gist of his speech is as follows: The center of the enemy in the Greater East Asia War is the United States. Therefore, the end of the Greater East Asia War should also be resolved by the United States surrendering. When reviewing the future of the Greater East Asia War, we must first grasp the US strategy towards Japan and the operational policy towards Japan. The United States is currently planning to expand its military equipment by the end of 1944, and then take a major offensive against Japan. The content is 4 million army personnel, 20,000 frontline aircraft, and the navy building 2.6 million tons of ships, 15,000 frontline aircraft, and in the preparation period, using aircraft and submarines to carry out attrition warfare against Japan. However, in today's world, today's strategy and tactics cannot be used tomorrow. How it will change is truly unpredictable. Before the Greater East Asia War, the tactics adopted by the United States were battleship centralism, also known as the giant gunship doctrine. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the unsinkable warships boasted by the US Navy have been sunk by the Japanese Navy at Pearl Harbor and the Malayan waters. They also painfully realized that the power of the air force was insufficient, so they abandoned their battleship centralism and adopted aircraft carrier centralism. This can be proven by the US Navy's plan to rush to build 85 aircraft carriers and the tactics used by the United States in the Coral Sea, Midway Island, and the Second Solomon Sea battle, which were mainly aircraft carriers. In the above battles, the losses of US aircraft carriers were very heavy. They then gained a new lesson, that is, if there are Japanese land bases, it is unfavorable to send a fleet mainly composed of an aircraft carrier to carry out operations. Therefore, they started to build land bases thoroughly on the continuous line from the Aleutian Islands in the north, through Midway Island to the Solomon Islands and the New Guinea Islands in the southwest Pacific, attempting to obtain land air bases. However, this plan still failed, so they planned to build long-range, super-heavy bombers. According to recent news, the super-heavy bomber can complete a 12,000-kilometer non-stop flight from Brisbane Port on the east coast of Australia to San Francisco on the west coast of the United States in 36 hours. If this is true, then Tokyo to Midway Island is only 8,000 kilometers, and Japan should make full preparations in both material and spiritual aspects. As for the situation in the north, Britain and the United States have repeatedly made plots and propaganda, attempting to alienate Japanese-Soviet relations. This really needs to be guarded against. In short, no matter what plots Britain and the United States make, Japan has the determination and countermeasures to deal with it. We can also say that the Greater East Asia War really started today. The United States is now beginning to prepare for war. Japan has absolute confidence in dealing with the US military force. At the same time, in order to win the economic war, we should strive to increase production and savings, and especially strive for important battles in order to establish a system of invincible war.

### Nineteen-Year-Olds Called Up for Military Service in Canada

### Britain Takes Firm Stance on India Issue, Amery States in the House of Commons that He Refuses to Negotiate with the Congress Party

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 1st

London: The British Secretary of State for India, Amery, stated in the House of Commons today that the British government still firmly refuses to negotiate with the Indian National Congress Party to resolve the Indian issue. The Labor Party Member of Parliament, Sorensen, asked Mr. Amery whether he knew that many politicians in India who were not members of the Congress Party wanted to communicate with the banned Congress Party leaders in order to find a solution. Mr. Amery replied that he did not believe that contact with Congress Party members at this time would promote a solution. When asked about intelligence that British aircraft had strafed Indian crowds, Mr. Amery avoided answering directly, only saying that he had nothing to add to the official announcement made in the Indian Legislative Assembly last week. The announcement stated that British aircraft had strafed Indians who had secretly sabotaged railways for convenience five times. Mr. Amery also said that in areas where troop movements were obstructed by railways, it was necessary to use aircraft to suppress the rioters' secret sabotage. Furthermore, the British government is not considering organizing an Indian national government.

### Rommel Attends Winter Relief Rally, Hitler's Speech Covered Military, Political, and Economic Matters

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 1st

Hitler's speech this time expounded in detail the economic situation of the Soviet summer campaign, the general military situation, the war against Britain, submarine warfare, and air warfare. The leader first stated the development of the occupied areas of Eastern Europe, making Europe not only lack raw materials and food, but also the Soviet Union's loss of such valuable commerce and industrial areas has inevitably exhausted its strength. Regarding the Stalingrad battle, the leader believed that the purpose of the summer offensive had been achieved due to the blocking of the Volga River. The leader also revealed that Germany will use the winter time and the technology of a large number of foreign technicians to manufacture more sophisticated new weapons in preparation for the coming spring. Neutral military observers in Berlin attach importance to the leader's statement of stepping up submarine production and warned that Britain's indiscriminate bombing is even more worrying. General Rommel was also present when the leader delivered his speech. Rommel looked radiant and in good spirits, which shows that the foreign rumors that Rommel was suffering from an unknown disease were untrue.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 1st

Hitler presided over the winter relief rally at the Berlin Sports Arena yesterday. First, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels gave an opening speech, and then the leader gave a speech in warm cheers, satirizing Roosevelt and Churchill, saying that they only indulged in empty talk, and he only knew how to be down-to-earth and pragmatic, only seeking to solve the urgent problems at hand and had no time to deduce the future situation. The Atlantic Charter is a stupid literary work, and its effectiveness will inevitably be shattered by iron facts in a few years. The full text of the leader's speech is as follows.

### Mocking Roosevelt and Churchill

For years, Roosevelt and Churchill have hindered the implementation of the National Socialist Party's plans, but they have never succeeded. Now, the promises they offer to the world are the same as what we have done in Germany. Then, they actually declared war on us on this basis. Is it not a strange fact? It is even more ridiculous that Roosevelt and Churchill are now posing as saviors of the world's crisis, failing to recognize the times. British and American propaganda often disregards the facts and conceals Germany's great victories. However, in recent months, the German army's battle achievements have shocked the world. Under favorable circumstances, it can be asserted that it will directly attack the Don River, then the Volga River, and arrive at and occupy Stalingrad. However, Britain and the United States still say that it is not relevant to the overall situation. Then, our army has occupied 65% to 70% of the Soviet Union's iron ore resources, developed the world's largest grain-producing area, and entered the Soviet Union's Moitian, which has become a momentum to shake the Soviet Union's economic lifeline.

### Second Front

Regarding the opening of the second front, as when the Canadian army and a small number of British troops recently attacked Dieppe, they were defeated by the German army in less than nine hours. This shows the lack of strength of Britain and the United States. The intention of Britain and the United States to open up the second front is only propaganda to threaten Germany, and there is nothing to fear. Even if Britain and the United States really have the power to attack, there is now more than enough power to counterattack. No matter where Churchill makes another landing attempt, it would be Churchill's luck if he could stay on land for nine hours. Last winter, with the help of God, the German people and armed comrades were finally able to safely pass through the past and defeat General Winter. The German soldiers' fighting spirit was firm and unyielding. After entering the spring, they launched an offensive. This alone is enough to prove that God is also loyal to the German people. The offensive launched by the German army after spring may not have been foreseen by the enemy. In the past three years of battle achievements, the German army has conquered the west and the east, and has won every battle. The German soldiers are both intelligent and brave, and have established the victory of this war. The German people are all happy about this.

### Battle Plan

The battle plan of our army this year is still very simple, that is, 1. Calmly respond to all incidents. Where our army does not intend to attack, it will stand firm and defend, making the enemy tired and self-defeating. 2. Where we must attack, we will implement the attack. Our operational purpose is also very simple, that is, to destroy the mainstay of the international conspirators. The strategy of the German army against the Soviet Union in the summer of this year was to eliminate the remnants of the Crimean Peninsula, gain control of the Black Sea, and launch the Battle of Kerch and the Battle of Sevastopol from this point. Then, sweep away the traces of the enemy on the Volkhov River and prepare to break through the Soviet army's defense line on the Don River. At that time, the Soviet army attempted to break into the Hombach River from Kharkov and defeat the two German army positions on the Eastern Front. However, the German army took preemptive measures before it launched, making its plan a bubble. The purpose of the German army's major offensive this time is three: 1. To seize the Soviet Union's last wheat-producing area. 2. Deprive it of its remaining coking coal. 3. Seize its oil fields or cut off its supply lines. After the offensive was launched, the Volga River, the largest transportation artery in the Soviet Union, became the only goal of our army. Therefore, the Don River Bay, the Volga River, and Stalingrad became places that must be contested. Then, cutting off the Volga River and occupying Stalingrad can take a step further to complete this strategy. Now the period is not far away.

### Use of Winter

Another plan of Germany this year is to organize a vast occupied area. Most of the tens of thousands of kilometers of railway lines have now been repaired, and thousands of bridges are yet to be built. Our army does not intend to make further progress into enemy territory this winter. The biggest task at present will be to develop the occupied area and stabilize the supply of food and raw materials that we need, in order to maintain the production business of the whole of Europe. Regarding the African war, the German army has now suddenly stopped attacking. This is a steady and steady strategy. After the supply line is fully organized, it will act accordingly. Germany's plan to organize the midline occupied area has now begun. German farmers are already engaged in farming work a few kilometers behind the front line. The German recent increase in the bread restriction is due to the agricultural production in the occupied areas of the Eastern Front. This matter is still in its infancy, and this satisfactory result has already been achieved. Therefore, there is no doubt that Europe's economic life will improve day by day in the future.

### Celebrating Allies

The alliance between Germany and its friendly countries is now becoming stronger and stronger. Although the enemy has used various conspiracies to destroy it, the result has always been unsuccessful. Japan's brilliant military achievements are admirable to us. Today, we have finally obtained a true world alliance and are striving to build a new world order together. The leader then discussed the British air raid on Germany, saying that when British aircraft first bombed the German people in May 1940, he made a serious warning to Churchill. Unexpectedly, Churchill ignored it and repeatedly carried out his barbaric atrocities. Therefore, Germany could not bear it any longer and had to retaliate. Today, the suffering of Britain's air raids is even worse than that of Germany. The Jew who started it has already reaped the consequences. The leader explained the nature of the Eastern Front war, saying that the people under German National Socialism have become more united because of the war, and the cooperation between Germany and its allies has also increased. The friendly forces of various countries fighting on the Eastern Front are now the most loyal comrades of the Axis powers.

### Never Kneel

The spirit of sacrifice of the German workers should also be written and specially written, because German workers have been working 10 to 11 hours a day since this spring. In some factories, there are even no weekends or other holidays. The purpose is to accelerate the production of war equipment. I dare to guarantee to the people of the country that the German soldiers on the front line are indestructible. I also told the soldiers on the front line that the people in the country will never put them aside. Within this amount of time, we will never allow the activities of saboteurs. The leader's conclusion said that under any circumstances, we will never surrender. Our enemies will obviously try their best to prolong the war, but we will also do our best to defeat it. As for the enemy wanting to defeat us, it is impossible. National Socialist Germany and its allies will produce a glorious victory in this war.

### Blackout Drill on the First Day Lasted Two Hours

Future Drills to be Held at Any Time in Preparation

The blackout drill, which had been in preparation for a month, began at 7:30 PM yesterday. After receiving notification from the authorities, each household immediately installed lamp shades and curtains. The situation was more serious than the last time. Some stores closed early. Trams and buses operated as usual, but at a slower speed. After 8:00 PM, a loud alarm sounded, and the entire city was plunged into darkness, which was particularly tense. The Chief of the Police Department and the Director of the Air Defense Department of the Public Works Department issued a statement urging citizens to strictly abide by all regulations during the air defense blackout period. The two-hour drill was reported by the Greater East Asia Radio Station. It is hoped that citizens will be prepared at any time in the future.

Drill Results Not Yet Reported

The results of the first large-scale blackout drill held last night have not yet been reported truthfully. However, it is expected that the most failed point that the authorities believed to be the case a month ago, that is, most citizens failed to remain calm during the drill, will not be repeated this time. The authorities have repeatedly stated that citizens should operate or work as usual during the blackout. The Medical Officer of Health of the Public Works Department, Mr. Watanabe, was scheduled to return to Shanghai from Japan by ship yesterday to participate in the inspection of Shanghai's first expanded air defense exercise, but there was no news of Mr. Watanabe's arrival in Shanghai yesterday. When the Director of the Air Defense Section of the Police Department of the Public Works Department, Mr. Matsumoto, received newspaper reporters, he claimed that the simulated blackout training conducted in the Public Concession since September 20 had achieved unexpectedly good results. Therefore, he could guarantee to the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters that the ten-day blackout training that started yesterday would be effective.

### Police Mobilized in the French Concession

For the sake of assisting in the holding of a large-scale air raid drill, the Baojia authorities of the French Concession yesterday began a full mobilization of the civil police force. Each Lianbao (group of bao) was temporarily assigned a post, with duty commencing from 8:00 AM and continuing until 12:00 midnight. When on duty, each member of the civil police force carried a bell, which they would ring to warn residents within the area when an air raid commenced and concluded, so that they would be aware.

Baobei Foreigners' Baojia on Duty

The self-defense corps of the Foreigners' Baojia in the various districts of Baobei in the Public Concession began going on duty yesterday afternoon. The head of the Foreigners' Baojia, Kataige (chairman of the Jewish Federation), set an example by being the first to carry out the new duty of going on duty. It is reported that Baobei is divided into three Baojia districts: Hongkou, Huishan, and Yulin, totaling 41 bao. More than 2,000 foreigners will take turns serving as self-defense corps members, each person being on duty for three hours every five days. It was revealed at a meeting of the Foreigners' Baojia on Tuesday that the Foreigners' Self-Defense Corps lacked funds to purchase equipment such as police batons and guard booths. Therefore, it was decided to instruct all Jewish immigrants in Baobei to report the amount of their income so that it could be submitted to the police department to determine who could donate cash to purchase equipment to be issued to the Foreigners' Self-Defense Corps members and to build guard booths on the streets.

Director General Okazaki Issues Statement

The local branch of the Domei News Agency reports that Director General Okazaki of the Public Works Department issued a statement yesterday morning, asking the general public to cooperate fully during the ten-day blackout period so that the air raid drill implemented by the authorities could be completely successful. According to Okazaki's disclosure, the Public Works Department has completed all necessary preparations for rescue, fire fighting, and police services during air raids, in accordance with a plan that has been prepared for several months. The general headquarters for air defense in the Public Concession will be located in the general office of the Public Works Department. The police department will be responsible for guiding the public and maintaining治安 during the alert and blackout period. The rescue team of the health department will be fully responsible for all rescue work, such as urgently sending seriously injured persons to hospitals. Due to the different local conditions, the air raid fire fighting methods used in Japan will be modified and implemented in Shanghai.

### British, American, and Other Nationals Wear Armbands Starting Yesterday

Clergymen and Pastors Exempted

About 7,000 expatriates in Shanghai from the 34 countries at war with Japan or that have severed diplomatic relations with Japan, including Britain and America, have been ordered by the Japanese and Italian military authorities here to wear red armbands on their left arms starting yesterday. Those who violate this order will be punished according to military law. However, clergymen of churches and charitable organizations, such as pastors and nuns, are exempt from wearing armbands. In addition, expatriates from certain countries whose governments are currently in exile in London are also exempt from wearing armbands, but the details are unknown. It is reported that 4,500 British nationals and 2,000 American nationals have received armbands, with the remainder being nationals of other countries.

### River-Based Baojia Formally Established

After active preparations by the relevant authorities, the river-based Baojia office in the naval defense area has formally been established. The entire river area has been divided into 20 districts and 166 bao. The election of district heads and bao heads has also been ordered. Now that all preparations have been completed, a formal establishment ceremony was held at 11:00 AM on the 1st at the Japanese Club on Wenjian Shi Road. The ceremony was simple and solemn, with representatives from the relevant authorities attending and participating. First, the director of the River-Based Port Affairs Department, Koyuda, delivered a speech, followed by a celebratory banquet.

### Funding for Relief of Impoverished

The Sanjiao Daode Shanyihui (Three Religions Morality Charity Association) has been working to provide relief to the impoverished and orphans for more than a year now. As of the present, a total of 1,811 impoverished people have been receiving long-term assistance. All of them are either overburdened, unable to make ends meet, or affected by unemployment. Due to rising prices and a sharp decline in donations, expenses have increased dramatically. Starting today, the association is undertaking an expanded fundraising campaign for the relief of the impoverished. The association appeals to leaders of all communities, leaders of all industries, and philanthropists from all walks of life to remember their ties to their hometown and the spirit of being in the same boat, and to do their best to assist by making donations. Donations can be sent to No. 10, Lane 10, West Side of the New World on Jing'an Temple Road. For telephone notification, please dial 91067.

### Dark Shanghai—The First Night of Blackout

Once the Red Packet clock stopped, it has been nearly ten months. The Tianchu MSG advertisement on the International Hotel no longer looks down on all of Shanghai. Even more unthinkable, 90% of the more than 7,000 streetlights have been lost. Yet, Shanghai still has a day shrouded in darkness. The people of Shanghai are now living a strange life.

Daytime

In the cafes, everyone is talking about the blackout. In the dance halls, no one will come out to dance at night, right? Someone said that on the streets, in cars, everyone is advising to go home early.

Perhaps it is because of this strange life. In the cafes shrouded in black cloth, people are still sipping their coffee, which is getting more expensive with each cup, and exhaling circles of smoke. Under the pale green light, how poetic the mood! In the dance halls, candles are lit on the piano, and the candlelight dance in Waterloo Bridge is the medium for the merging of two hearts.

On Jin Shenfu Road, I jumped into a tram heading from west to east. The carriage was filled with black heads. There really wasn't a single streetlight. Someone said the ticket seller, though busy punching tickets, still interjected, "Who's kidding you?" So everyone laughed, laughed so innocently, so naturally.

That long Xiafei Road, in the days of French Democracy Memorial, was the most orderly and brightly lit road in Shanghai. Now, you simply can't see anyone across the street. The driver, constantly ringing the bell, stretched his neck three feet long, watching the tracks in front of the car. However, black shadows were still shuttling back and forth like bats. The people of Shanghai are not even afraid of death. The driver can only sigh.

At Luban Road, the car was forced to stop. No one asked why. Everyone got off the car amid the ticket seller's shouts. The street was pitch black, and there were even more bats shuttling around.

Walking along the sidewalk, the sidewalk was full of people. Fortunately, there was no echo when my foot was stepped on. In the daytime, it would have been a scolding or even a fight. The people of Shanghai really like to watch热闹 (rè nào, a lively scene), but what is there to see in the pitch black?

Stumbling along, I don't know how many streets I passed. Ahead, I found a red light. Looking closely, it was the post on Min Ti Ni Yin Road. However, this traffic light had long been out of order. I had been sent behind the Great World to avoid one, two, three bicycles. This is still a relatively bright world. It turned out that many vendors were gathered here. Tianjin pears and big lychees were only selling for three jiao apiece. It was a noisy scene, and many people were also gathered around the small green glass lights, buying cheap goods. No wonder the cheap silk shops were smashing their large glass windows for the week-long sale.

Stepping into the Public Concession from the bamboo fence of Gengxin Bridge, a crowd of people carrying baskets and pots swarmed in front of a noodle shop. Looking at my watch, it was twenty minutes to eight o'clock. The people of Shanghai were already eating their midnight snacks. I thought the household rice allocation for the next term would probably be reduced by half a catty.

The crowds watching the热闹 (rè nào, a lively scene) along the way were the same as in the French Concession. The so-called groping forward was a personal experience. However, on second thought, it was fortunate that there were so many crowds watching热闹 (rè nào, a lively scene). Otherwise, if I were the only person walking from Luban Road to Sima Road, I would be even more frightened, and perhaps the things in my bag would also be "moving house."

This was the first day of the blackout. With the experience of the first day, perhaps no one will advise going home early on the second day, because everyone is sipping coffee, dancing, and watching热闹 (rè nào, a lively scene) in the dark. Although it is a strange life, it will become commonplace.

### Baojia Publicity Week Postponed Due to Heavy Workload and Inadequate Preparation

To be held from the 5th to the 15th

In order to improve the security of the concession, assist in promoting Baojia self-defense work, and raise funds, the Baojia authorities of the Public Concession have initiated a Baojia self-defense publicity and fundraising campaign. Meetings have been held on separate days, and it has been decided to raise 2 million yuan for Baojia expenses. In order to ensure that the people within the concession truly understand the true meaning of Baojia, the originally scheduled Baojia expanded publicity week from October 1st to 10th has been postponed to October 5th to 15th due to the heavy workload of the publicity work, according to inquiries made to the Baojia authorities. The publicity methods are divided into the following types: (A) Written publicity; (B) Radio publicity, inviting Baojia committee members, Baojia guidance committee members, and social celebrities to speak about the meaning of the movement; (C) Entertainment publicity, requesting various entertainers to insert words and phrases related to the movement into their performances so that the audience can understand the meaning of Baojia self-defense imperceptibly (the words and phrases will be drafted by the Baojia committee and distributed to the entertainers for publicity to ensure uniformity); (D) Film and lantern slides with text will be shown in various cinemas; (E) Lecture publicity, the method is the same as item B.

### French Concession Civil Police Recognized for Diligence and Awarded Commendation

At 9:30 AM on September 30th of this year, Shen Fupu, a member of the 788th Civil Police Group of the 38th Lianbao of the French Concession, was on duty at the intersection of Jixiang Street and Fada Road in the Mailan District when he saw Hu Kaifu, a shop assistant from the No. 7 Qianzhuang in Lane 247 of Tianjin Road (resident of No. 170, Wenmiao Road, Nanshi), snatching banknotes worth 2,548.50 yuan from Chen Shenghua (17 years old, resident of No. 4, Lane 33, Zilai Street), who was holding them under his arm. He immediately stepped forward to pursue and arrest him. The Inspector General of the French Concession Police Department was extremely satisfied with the actions of the civil police group member and awarded him a special commendation.

### Respectable Merchant Implicated in Robbery of Woolen Cloth Store

After Jiangbei bandit Zhou Qifu colluded with a gang and robbed the Turongtai Woolen Cloth Store at No. 80 Luban Road in the French Concession in May of this year, the victim reported the case and requested an arrest. The detectives arrested the thief Zhou, who confessed that his accomplices were Chen Liechang (owner of Chen Tai Wood Shop at Zhangjiazhai, Avenue Edward VII) and Liu Zhiming (owner of Zhongyuan Company at No. 206, Continental Building, Jiujiang Road, resident of No. 8, Daodeli, Beile Road). The detectives then arrested Chen Liechang and continued to investigate the case. However, when detectives Xu Kaixing, Zhu Jutong, and Chen Rongtang went to No. 8, Daodeli, Beile Road to arrest Liu Zhiming, Liu began to scream. The detectives then solicited bribes, but Liu reported them to the police station, and the three detectives Xu, Zhu, and Chen were detained for investigation. Now, after a thorough investigation by the West Detective of the French Police Department, it was determined that Liu Zhiming did indeed collude with Zhou and his gang to commit the robbery. Therefore, at 6:00 AM yesterday, Liu Zhiming was arrested again and immediately escorted to the court to be tried together with Zhou and the others. It was also stated that a detailed investigation of Liu Zhiming's part was still needed, and a request was made to postpone the court hearing. Zhou Qifu confessed that at the time, he was invited by Gao Xiaosanzi, who was still at large, along with Liu Zhiming, Chen Liechang, and other civilians, to rob the Turongtai Woolen Cloth Store. However, when questioned, Liu vehemently denied the matter. Chen Liechang's defense lawyer claimed that his client had been wronged. Chen Liechang was released on 10,000 yuan bail, while Liu, Zhou, and the others were all kept in custody.

### The Student Relief Association Over the Past Five Years

Five years ago, the authorities of the YMCA and YWCA felt that the fact that tens of thousands of young students could not continue their studies due to the impact of the war was an irreparable loss to society and the country. Therefore, they joined forces with the principals of church schools and enthusiastic people from all walks of life to organize a Student Relief Committee. Over the past five years, the committee has gone through a difficult journey. Fortunately, with the support and cooperation of the committee members and people from all walks of life, the Student Relief Committee has done some things for the poor students of Shanghai that, while not very surprising, are very practical.

First of all, the Student Relief Committee pioneered the establishment of scholarships for poor students above the high school level in Shanghai. Every semester, thousands of students apply for scholarships, but because the exams are strict, the investigations are strict, and the funding is limited, only about 150 to 200 students can receive this scholarship each semester. After December 8th of last year, because donations were cut off, this scholarship had to be suspended, which was unavoidable. The Student Relief Committee itself felt very guilty about this.

Secondly, over the past five years, the Student Relief Association has also solved the accommodation problem for poor students in Shanghai for a period of time. Since the outbreak of the war, the association has established a Student Economic Dormitory on the 3rd, 7th, and 8th floors of the Wuzhou Building on Sima Road. The establishment of this Student Economic Dormitory not only charged extremely low fees but also had strict management, which saved the students living in it a lot of expenses and also gave them a quiet place to rest after class. But it is also a pity that this undertaking eventually could not continue due to the expiration of the lease.

The Student Relief Committee has not only done its best to help poor students with their tuition fees and accommodation, but has also launched a winter clothing campaign for poor students. Last year, the Student Relief Committee received a large number of old suits, old coats, and old woolen sweaters from home and abroad, which were fairly distributed to poor students whose families were indeed poor and whose clothing was indeed lacking during the Christmas season, so that they would not suffer from cold and hunger in the cold winter season.

The fourth thing is the living allowances provided by the Student Relief Committee after December 8th. About 200 students were assisted last semester, with each student receiving living expenses ranging from dozens of yuan in pocket money to more than 200 yuan.

Currently, the work of the Student Relief Committee is focused on solving the problem of meals for poor students. There are several reasons for this: ㈠ As a result of the soaring cost of living in Shanghai, the biggest threat to the city is still the problem of eating. Students are no exception. Although tuition fees have increased, 300 yuan per semester is still only 300 yuan. However, the semesterly food expenses of each student must be more than 1,000 yuan. ㈡ Not only do various schools have small-scale scholarship programs, but the Shen and Xin newspapers now also have large-scale support. It seems that the Student Relief Committee does not need to repeat its efforts. ㈢ Although student dormitories may not be secondary to meals in terms of need, they cannot be held due to a lack of housing.

However, according to the experience of the past one or two years, a solid economic foundation is necessary to ensure the success and universality of the undertaking of assisting poor students with meals, because this is a business that loses money with open eyes. The Student Relief Committee's launch of an expanded campaign to assist poor students with meals is also due to this reason. We hope that people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about doing good will be able to cooperate with and assist us. Then, their enthusiasm will not only directly help countless poor students, but will also indirectly support a large, magnificent, and thriving force for the country and society (Wu Ren).

### Rongwu Society Lectures on Sutras

The 65th session of the Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society featured Shen Jueling speaking on the theme of "Focusing on Oneself is Common to All Five Religions." Mr. Shen, with a slight waist pain from a fall yesterday, lectured on the Confucian emphasis on oneself and then withdrew. Yang Zhongyi continued to speak on the Buddhist and Taoist emphasis on oneself and then dispersed. The 66th session featured Shen Jueling continuing to lecture on the previous topic, the Christian emphasis on oneself according to the Old Testament, and the Islamic emphasis on oneself according to the Quran. Zhao Ximing then elaborated on the meaning of sincerity achieving itself and the Way following itself in great detail, with many encouraging words for those seeking the Way. Gu Daogong then spoke on the difference between "我 (wǒ, I)" and "吾 (wú, I)," saying that "我 (wǒ, I)" comes from "戈 (gē, spear)" and "古 (gǔ, ancient)," the character for "kill," hence Confucius rejected "我 (wǒ, I)." "吾 (wú, I)" comes from "口 (kǒu, mouth)" and "五 (wǔ, five)" sounds. Five is the central number of heaven and earth. Universally referring to oneself as "吾 (wú, I)" is suitable for the middle way. It is said that on October 4th, Shen Jueling will lecture on the study of the Book of Changes, the differences between the Jing and Zhuan, and the similarities and differences.

### Third Football Trial Match: Donghua Wins by Luck, Shengfangji Loses with a Penalty Kick in the Second Half

The final act of the football trial match was the third meeting between Donghua and Shengfangji, which was held at the racecourse at 5:00 PM yesterday. The audience reached 5,000. Under extreme tension, Donghua narrowly defeated Shengfangji by a score of 2 to 1. Donghua relied on good luck, especially the goalkeeper Zhang Banglun's excellent performance, making great contributions. Yuan Kun's sharp breakthroughs in the forward line were also a great contribution. Zhuang Youren, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, and Zai Linjing had effective coordination. Liang Shutang maintained his original state. Shu Shigeng's offense was not satisfactory, and the goal was often open. Pan Honghai's skills were not as good as the Sheng team. Greenburg made the most contribution, running all over the field. Funnjie and Muhuada and Edward were all just right. The first half ended in a 0-0 draw. In the second half, Sheng team's Green repeatedly fouled, resulting in a penalty kick, which was taken by Han Longhai. The ball went into the net. Both sides were unwilling to concede. Before long, the time was up. Donghua luckily defeated Shengfangji 2-1.

After deducting the interest income tax of 10.08 yuan, the total expenditure was 146,740.38 yuan. The total surplus should be 79,964.92 yuan.

### After 200 Consecutive Drops, Chinese Stocks Suddenly Rise Again

Gongxin Electrical Appliances Debuts

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market first fell sharply and then suddenly rose, regaining its firm footing. The turning point was due to the excessive drops in the past two days. Investors were encouraged, and the overall confidence of all parties turned from tired to hopeful that it would continue to prosper. The increasing news of the preparation for the establishment of a securities market is another factor in the upward movement of prices. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile broke through the 1,600 yuan mark and then rebounded. It has risen from 1,590 yuan to 1,645 yuan. The small-denomination stocks Hongsheng and Dachina Weaving both rose from 11 yuan to 12 yuan, finally matching Fuchang at 17.50 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Weaving and An Da Shirts also rebounded after falling, but they were still slightly lower than the previous day, with the former down 5 jiao and the latter down 1 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco Company rose from 102 yuan to 106 yuan, rebounding by 1 yuan. Dachina Match fell to a low of half a yuan, fluctuating between 210 yuan and 215 yuan. In the department store industry, Yong'an rebounded to the 120 yuan mark, rising by 1 yuan alone. Xinxin was down 5 yuan, and Guohuo was down 3 yuan, both at 115 yuan, following the trend of first falling and then rebounding. Underwear was slightly lower by 2.5 jiao. The cultural industry was the most stable, with only World Bookstore down 5 jiao. Commercial Press at 195 yuan, China at 195 yuan, and Yongxiang at 25.50 yuan all matched. In the pharmaceutical industry, Zhongxi was down 15 yuan at 435 yuan, Wuzhou added 2.5 yuan to reach 297.50 yuan, Xinya was down 7.5 jiao at 45.50 yuan, and Zhongfa fell to a low of 81 yuan and then rebounded by 2 yuan, matching Minyi at 65 yuan. Transportation stocks fell the most. Zhabei Water and Electricity was the lowest at 36 yuan, and Chinese Electric was down by more than 1 yuan at 31.50 yuan. Gongxin Electrical Appliances debuted at a price of 12 yuan, and buyers were enthusiastic. Other stocks have also rebounded. The details are recorded below.

### Public Bonds Exceeding the Price Limit Cannot Be Officially Opened for Trading

Due to numerous short-covering activities in the unofficial over-the-counter market for public bonds, market prices surged. However, sellers were also quite active, readily selling at the high prices, resulting in favorable deals. The market atmosphere resembled that of easily frightened birds, a state of self-induced alarm, but not entirely without cause. The market price rose to above fifty yuan, exceeding the face value of the bonds. It is rumored that the authorities believe this is unsuitable and that official trading can only commence when the price is within fifty yuan. While this rumor lacks concrete evidence, it is not entirely unfounded. Abnormal and disproportionate price increases are unlikely to benefit the market. Yesterday, Type C bonds initially traded at 54 yuan, reaching a high of 55.4 yuan, with the final price also at 55.3 yuan. Type A bonds were priced even higher than Type C, while Type B bonds experienced a sharp increase of 2.1 yuan, reaching 4.8 yuan. Types D and E also saw a good increase of 1.5 to 1.6 yuan. The transactions were chaotic and difficult to track.

### Decorative Gold Exchange Rate Listed Slightly Below 2400 Yuan

Yesterday, the Shanghai gold and jewelry industry association, Da Xin Tong Hang, listed the exchange rate for decorative gold at 2450 yuan per tael at retail outlets. Around 10:00 AM, it was slightly reduced by 50 yuan to 2400 yuan (purchase price reduced by over 300 yuan). Inter-dealer trading prices fell even more sharply, dropping close to the 2100 yuan level. The market situation was weak, with the lowest price being 2180 yuan, down 10 yuan. Amid selling pressure, it fell to 2120 yuan, before rising to 2150 yuan due to buying by a certain group. At noon, it declined again, with a difference of 60 yuan. Trading volume was sparse. The price of standard silver for jewelry was 14 yuan per tael, while the inter-dealer trading price was 13.5 yuan.

### Military Bond Settlement Rare After Month's End

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw a slight drop in Japanese military scrip, due to fewer settlements after the month's end. The inter-dealer trading price was 5.5546 yuan. Banks and small money shops sold at 5.565 yuan and bought at 5.545 yuan, the same as the previous day.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight loan interest rate remained at 1.4%.

### Scarce Arrival of Miscellaneous Grains

Yesterday, the arrival of beans was again delayed, leading to reduced supply and sales, and very little trading. Only 30 bags of Tianjin red beans were traded at a price of 165 yuan. Two batches of Chongming sand red beans were priced at 164 yuan.

Arrivals of red sorghum were scarce, leading to brisk sales and a rising trend. Yesterday, one cart of Mingguang red sorghum was priced at 117 yuan, and 50 bags of old stock were priced at 98 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Dips, Then Halts Decline as Buyers Hunt for Bargains

Factory Cloth

Yesterday, the cloth market initially weakened but then strengthened, with the situation stabilizing. White goods and fine cloth transactions saw prices rise due to dealers searching for bargains. Twelve-pound Dachen Factory singles rose to 157.1 yuan, Fugui Factory singles to 154 yuan, and Bank singles to 151 to 152 yuan with some selling. Coarse cloth also remained firm. Sixteen-pound Diqiu was at 188 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong at 110 yuan. Taohua Nvshi Lin initially opened at 249.5 yuan, rising to 250.5 yuan and then falling back to around 249 yuan. However, market sentiment improved and prices gradually rose, reaching a high of 251.75 yuan, an increase of approximately 2 yuan per bolt.

Eastern Cloth

The gray market also initially fell but then rose. New singles of Dragon Head fine cloth were rarely sold and did not experience much price movement. At the noon close, it was quoted at 166 yuan, while the smallest transaction for Bank singles was 154.75 yuan, before rising to 156.5 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan. Caiqiu was at 155.25 yuan, Feiyu at 154 yuan, Yanghe at 153 yuan, Labu at 152 yuan, and the Hong Dan of Sijunzi Serge was stable at 6.82 to 6.83 yuan for a long time. Later, some buying occurred, and it rose back to 6.86 yuan.

### High Demand for Woolen Cloth for Military Uniforms

Mai Er Deng woolen cloth has recently become quite popular, with prices remaining firm. Shunquanlong Yipin Tu is offered at 140 yuan, Maigao Kao Hong Tu at 115 yuan, and Shida at 76 to 77 yuan. There is strong demand because it can be used to make coats and uniforms, and is the most affordable of the winter woolen fabrics.

### Fresh Walnuts

The first batch of Xin Changping walnuts has arrived in small quantities. It is said that this year's harvest is very poor and production costs are also high, so the initial trading is very brisk. The opening price was 440 yuan, and it is now quoted at 450 to 460 yuan. New Jinan walnut meat continues to arrive, with prices rising by about 50 marks.

### Shilu Branches Surge by 100 Yuan

The price of shilu branches has risen sharply by 100 yuan per day due to strong sales in Zhejiang. However, ordinary Haikou and Shuidong branches have arrived and will soon be available for trading.

### Black Pepper Continues to Rise Strongly

The price of black pepper has been rising recently due to slightly increased sales. At the same time, speculative trading has also been very active, leading to an even tighter trend, with total price increases reaching over 100 marks.

### Prices of British and American Cigarettes Fall Daily

The selling prices of British and American cigarettes continue to fall due to weak retail sales and cautious purchasing by both retailers and speculators. Japanese and domestic cigarettes have also stabilized, so the prices of all goods are generally quiet. The prices are: Great Britain brand, 8150 yuan; Lao Dao brand, 6400 yuan; Xiao Xiannv brand, 5150 yuan; Wu Hua brand, 5400 yuan, all down 50 to over 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Pin Hai brand, 6200 yuan, flat; Domestic cigarette Jinzita, 5100 yuan; Meili brand, 4700 yuan; Jinshu brand, 3250 yuan; Bai Jinlong, 3100 yuan; Japanese cigarette Jinqiang, 2630 yuan; Jindalou, 3000 yuan; Hong Meigui, 1980 yuan; Quanlu brand, 2950 yuan; Nianzhi, 2700 yuan; Shuangfu, 3000 yuan; Zhinan brand, 2450 yuan, with little change.

Commentary

### The First Night of Blackout Regulations

— Zhizhu

It is the first night of blackout regulations. I left my office and headed home. I have been in Shanghai for nearly ten years and have never had dinner at home. From today onwards, I plan to change this habit. People who are busy outside every day should also get up early and go to bed early.

After dinner, the neighborhood head had already gone door-to-door to warn people to cover their lamps and lower their curtains so that no light could be seen outside.

The two children were almost as excited as if it were New Year's.

"Mom, I'll cover the lamps!" the younger one had already climbed onto the table.

"Find the curtains and pull them down!" the older one naturally didn't want to miss the opportunity.

My wife was particularly cautious, running downstairs to the courtyard to look up at the apartment to see if any light was visible outside. I heard there was a fine if you didn't comply, it's no joke. It seemed she had a lot of information.

Looking at the circle of light on the table, I couldn't help but think of the happiness of reading under the oil lamp in my childhood. So I randomly picked up a book from my desk and started flipping through it.

The two children do their homework under the lamp every day, but today they jumped onto the bed. Seeing me flipping through a book, the older one said, "Dad, how can we read in this little light?"

The younger one wasn't as clever as the older one, and she gave herself away first. She continued what her brother said:

"Dad, can we not study today?"

My wife laughed and said, "Those are all good ideas."

I only flipped through two pages of the book and reluctantly closed it. It's rare to come home early, so I should go to bed early.

The landlady, however, ran down from the third floor. She saw me at our door and said with a smile, "Mr. Li, you're home early today too. Go to bed early. The neighborhood head just came to say that the lights have to be turned off at nine o'clock. I was afraid you wouldn't be back. Now that you're back, that's good, hee hee."

"Turn off the lights?" I wondered. Last time, during the air raid drill, many people turned off their lights and went to bed early. Later, I learned that as long as the lights were covered, we could still work as usual. The neighborhood head's words can't be trusted, right?

"No, Mrs. Li knows. This is called a feint. The landlady is used to this kind of thing. There's a fine if you don't turn off the lights. I can't afford to be fined, hee hee. Since Mr. Li is back, go to bed early. I'll go downstairs and tell them, hee hee."

This must be the landlady's idea, I thought. I also heard voices of protest from downstairs, but the landlady's reason was still, "I can't afford to be fined."

Sure enough, at nine o'clock, it felt like we had fallen into hell. Even the circle of light was taken away in the landlady's hee-hee laughter.

"It's going to be ten days," I sighed. But the sound of mahjong in the landlady's room had also stopped. Just sleep in the dark then. When you're fast asleep, you don't know whether it's dark or light.

### Fortune and Misfortune

— Zixin

Life has become increasingly difficult in recent years, so I often feel resentful. When I see or read advertisements about pampered Pekingese dogs riding in rickshaws or advertisements searching for lost police dogs with rewards, I become even more indignant, feeling a surge of anger.

However, when I accidentally glimpsed a wounded and dying stray dog in a quiet corner, my hatred for dogs suddenly wavered.

Moreover, from this, I had the following feelings:

Perhaps in the past, it was a police dog loyal to its duties, guarding the property of a factory owner, just as young and strong workers worked hard to increase the wealth of the factory owner. When he and it had exhausted their sweat and blood, they were like sugarcane that had been squeezed dry, with only the pulp remaining, and were driven out the door without any mercy.

He and it are both so unfortunate with such unfortunate fates.

But on the other hand, there are people and dogs who reap without sowing. He enjoys the blood and sweat of others, drop by drop, doing nothing, playing with dogs and other things to relieve boredom. It is either exquisite and clever, not needing to work hard, but relying on flattering gestures to eat, drink, and play leisurely, living the life of a pampered darling of adults.

He and it seem to be the lucky darlings of heaven.

Is the fortune and misfortune of people and dogs arranged long ago? Yes, since the beginning of history, mankind has long laid the foundation for fortune and misfortune, but the arrangement is definitely not by some so-called God or Bodhisattva, but precisely by those clever, unearned darlings of heaven who are stabilizing their acquired territories.

From this, I became completely enlightened, and my hatred turned in another direction from then on.

### A Nighttime Pilgrimage on the Streets

— Ling Zuren

Night brings profound darkness, heavily pressing down on this twentieth-century city.

This place is no longer the city that never sleeps. The red lights that used to paint the half-covered screen with a sunset glow, and the intense headlights of cars that intertwined like the beams of searchlights, have all become relics of its former glory.

Therefore, the streets at night are ruled by darkness, swallowed up by it, filled with an eerie and terrifying atmosphere that replaces the various lights. The only things occupying the streets at night are the red lights atop the self-defense force guard posts, shining like the eyes of a drunkard in the darkness, appearing solemn and stern.

The hearts of pedestrians are gray and heavy. The sound of their footsteps is shrouded in sighs over the ruggedness of life's road.

The barricades at the road junctions, made of bamboo poles, squat in the darkness like ferocious beasts baring their teeth, giving pedestrians a great deal of wariness.

The traffic lights are merely a recollection in the minds of rickshaw pullers. The black uniforms of the Indian police and their two waving white sleeves are indeed a clear and distinct signal.

The sparse lights in a few shops faintly resemble fishing lights on the sea.

The smiles of young people have disappeared from the street corners. Those wanderers who have lost the light are trudging through the darkness in search of their homes.

From someone's radio floats a burst of sad melody. The desolate tune deeply stirs the heartstrings of the wanderers buried in the darkness.

The streets at night in a twentieth-century city are so somber and bleak.

### Overcoming Difficulties

— Qian Penglun

I once heard a motto from a great entrepreneur: "Ease is the crystallization of many difficulties." This sounds like commonplace platitudes, but upon careful reflection, one will feel that it has great meaning.

To give a very small example, sometimes when we pick up a pencil and find that its tip is inevitably blunt, we will unthinkingly take out a small knife from our pocket and lightly sharpen it a few times. Immediately, the pencil tip becomes sharp and usable again. This seems like the most ordinary thing to us now, but we must not forget that when we were children, we cut our fingers many times, broke the lead many times, and endured many failures before we achieved today's proficiency and ease.

Although this is a very small example, it shows that as long as we tolerate failure, then when we encounter it again in the future, we can handle it easily and solve it smoothly. A person with more skills has more foothold in society, more security in life, and is one step closer to the road to success. Therefore, "ease is the crystallization of many difficulties" can be considered a common secret of success. (Reward for scholarship)

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Human Hell

Aying was eager to know the method that Wei Shaoyun had discussed and repeatedly asked what the method was. Wei Shaoyun said, "Go ask them." As he spoke, he pointed to Cuizhen, meaning, "How can I tell you here?" Aying then walked from the room to the outside and saw three or four people whispering in the south room. She nodded and smiled, "I know it was Little Zhuge's idea." The one called Little Zhuge was a thin-faced man with a thin, long neck that looked somewhat like a pen holder. When he ate, you could see the food going down his throat with each bite. He was under Wei Shaoyun's command but had not yet made any special achievements. He was now attaching half a cigarette butt to a cigarette, making it long, and holding it in his mouth. It was said that his wisdom always came out slowly as he smoked. He winked at Aying, his cigarette still in his mouth, and said, "The tigress has come to sit down and talk." Aying raised her fist and pretended to punch him, but missed, only causing a small piece of ash to fall on the table. He laughed, "Your husband is called Tiger Mountain, aren't you a tigress? I'm telling the truth, not daring to scold anyone." Aying sat down and said, "I haven't eaten yet. Tell me quickly what you've come up with for my brother."

Little Zhuge took the cigarette in his hand, puffed out his pointed mouth and thin lips, and blew a puff of air that made the ash on the table fly around, into the teacup, and onto Aying's and others' faces. Aying said, "You're really annoying. When I ask you to speak, you put on airs." Little Zhuge said, "This method is for dealing with women, and you're a woman, so you can't hear it." One of those sitting opposite Little Zhuge, acting as a mediator, hurriedly said, "Sister and Young Master Wei are siblings, and there are no outsiders here. What does it matter if you tell us?" Little Zhuge, Little Zhuge, then took a sip of hot tea and said with a smile, "This method of mine is tried and tested, a hundred times out of a hundred. Don't go bothering Miss Bian anymore, let her rest well. If she doesn't want to eat rice, then please give her congee. If she doesn't want congee, then please give her coffee and milk. If she still doesn't want it, don't force her. Don't say a word about wanting her to be a concubine or young mistress. Just wait until tonight, when the stars have turned, the night is deep and quiet." (192)
