### Under British Military Suppression, the Indian Situation Gradually Calmed Down; Demonstrations Occurred in Calcutta

Bear City, 15th, Allied News Agency: Under the suppression of British military force, the riots in Mumbai and other parts of India have calmed down. However, new riots have occurred in Calcutta, the center of the Indian conflict, and on the east coast of Madras. Due to British censorship of news, the true situation in India is difficult to obtain.

Mumbai, 10th, Havas Agency: According to official announcements, Calcutta police fired again today to suppress public riots. Eight demonstrators were injured. Subsequently, a group of demonstrators threw stones at a car carrying a British military officer and his wife, both of whom were injured. Additionally, in New Delhi, 55 people have been injured and over 40 killed in recent days.

Saigon, 15th, Haitong Agency: The situation in Mumbai is relatively calm, but at least seven riots occurred in Calcutta last night. Police fired 25 shots, and many demonstrators were injured. A British major general, a captain, and several other officers were injured by thrown bricks while driving through the streets.

Saigon, 15th, Haitong Agency: New Delhi reports that the British authorities in India yesterday promulgated a decree stipulating that anyone who commits serious destructive acts, such as damaging railways, transportation lines, and public facilities, will be sentenced to death. Those with less serious offenses will be publicly flogged. However, the Indian people's movements of disobedience, resistance, and strikes have not subsided. Military police in Calcutta spent the entire day dispersing repeatedly gathering demonstrators. Demonstrators cut off traffic, severed cables, and erected obstacles. 18,000 textile workers refused to return to work. The situation in Calcutta last night was very serious, and nearby troops were ordered to enter the city. Many stations along the important coastal railway lines were damaged by demonstrators throwing stones. The demonstration movement in New Delhi has calmed down somewhat. Pune, Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Lucknow, and other cities all experienced disturbances and strikes yesterday. Many Indian celebrities were arrested yesterday. Suicide squads have been established throughout India, with most of their members being students, young doctors, and engineers.

Nanjing, 15th, Allied News Agency: The Chongqing military conference held an emergency meeting on August 13 to discuss recent pressing issues, resolving not to interfere in the Indian issue. It is said that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Seymour, along with the military attaché, met with Chiang Kai-shek to explain the events in India. It is rumored that the British Ambassador even requested that Chongqing actively attack the Japanese army in Burma from Yunnan, in order to support the British policy of suppressing India by force. However, the Chongqing authorities are currently avoiding concrete plans and adopting a wait-and-see attitude to observe the development of the situation. It is reported that the emergency meeting of the military conference resolved as follows: (1) To abide by the military alliance with the United States to support American wartime policies; (2) To make every effort to suppress all reactionary elements, including anti-war and other peace groups, to maintain the wartime structure.

Saigon, 15th, Haitong Agency: According to Mumbai reports, a large number of Indian civilians continued to be killed and injured yesterday. The British official figures included 40 deaths and 55 injuries, only in one part of New Delhi's old city. In Nagpur, police opened fire on demonstrators on Thursday night, resulting in six deaths and fifteen injuries. No less than six hundred people were arrested by the British in Mumbai.

### Seven British Warships Entered Gibraltar; German Reporter Discusses Mediterranean War Situation, Claiming Axis Powers Have Gained Control of the Sea

Port of La Linea, Spain, 14th, Havas Agency: Today, someone witnessed the British aircraft carrier "Illustrious" entering the port of Gibraltar. The ship was heavily damaged, especially on the starboard side. Shortly after, a battleship and five destroyers also followed. One of the destroyers was heavily damaged. After the battleship anchored, the rescued sailors from the sunk aircraft carrier "Eagle" immediately began to disembark. It is reported that the "Illustrious" was one of the four British aircraft carriers in the convoy attacked in the western Mediterranean on the 11th of this month. Of the other three, the "Eagle" has sunk, the "Furious" was heavily damaged, and the "Wasp" (owned by the United States) caught fire.

Berlin, 15th, Haitong Agency: Haitong Agency's naval reporter, Pfeiffer, stated that after the recent heavy losses suffered by Allied convoys in the Mediterranean, it further proves that the British fleet, which once controlled the seas, can no longer use the Mediterranean route. Britain has now been forced to abandon this most advantageous route to Egypt and the Near East, but the perilous situation of Malta and Egypt compels them to risk danger again, sending a large convoy through the Mediterranean from Gibraltar. The Indian Ocean has been controlled by the Japanese fleet, and detouring around the Cape of Good Hope cannot meet their urgent needs. Therefore, they had to send a convoy, consisting of twenty-one large ships, carrying mostly important items, including oil tankers of about 8,000 to 15,000 tons, protected by twenty-five warships, sailing eastward from Gibraltar. German submarines and Italian motor torpedo boats sank the 22,600-ton aircraft carrier Eagle, the 9,300-ton cruiser Manchester, one destroyer, and three merchant ships. German and Italian air forces bombed and destroyed thirteen enemy ships, totaling about 100,000 tons. One British battleship was heavily damaged and returned to Gibraltar. The British aircraft carrier Furious was hit by a torpedo from an Italian submarine and caught fire. It was also heavily damaged when it returned to Gibraltar. The American aircraft carrier Wasp, attempting to sail to Malta, was also hit by six shells and caught fire. In addition, three cruisers and six cargo ships, totaling about 51,000 tons, were also bombed. The Italian navy rescued many crew members. This time, Britain suffered a heavy blow, and control of the Mediterranean Sea is now in the hands of the Axis powers.

Rome, 15th, Haitong Agency: Rome claims that even if one or two ships from the British convoy, which was largely destroyed in the Mediterranean, reach Malta, it will not benefit the island's supply because Malta and the North African front have different needs. North Africa urgently needs tanks and anti-tank guns. If the ships arriving in Malta are carrying this type of equipment, it will be of no use to Malta. What Malta urgently needs is food, gasoline, and anti-aircraft ammunition. The "Roman People's Daily" published a map showing the geographical position of the war's development. According to the report, the first contact occurred north of Oran, the second battle occurred on the route between Oran and Algiers, and the third major battle occurred southwest of Cape Spartivento, near the border between Algiers and Tunisia. The fourth battle was located northeast of Bizerte, north of Tunis. By this point, the convoy had collapsed.

German Announcement: British Ship Losses

Berlin, 15th, Haitong Agency: The German High Command issued a special communique stating that as a result of the major air and naval battle in the Mediterranean, the enemy was heavily defeated. Twenty-one enemy transport ships, merchant ships, and oil tankers, protected by warships, attempted to pass through the Strait of Sicily. Fifteen of them were sunk, totaling as many as 180,000 tons. All the oil tankers were completely destroyed. The remaining merchant ships arrived at the island of Malta with damage. Among the warships, the aircraft carrier Eagle (22,600 tons), two cruisers, and three destroyers were sunk. The aircraft carriers Furious (22,450 tons) and Glorious (23,000 tons) were heavily damaged and returned to Gibraltar, and three cruisers and three destroyers were also damaged. Our losses were very small.

Rome, 15th, Haitong Agency: According to the Italian High Command, the Italian air and naval forces continued to pursue the enemy convoy in the western Mediterranean. Motor torpedo boats hit one destroyer, and dive bombers hit one large ship. One heavy cruiser, one cruiser, and one battleship were also hit. Italian aircraft shot down four Spitfire aircraft.

Hitler Receives Bulgarian Envoy

German Headquarters, 15th, Haitong Agency: The Bulgarian Ambassador to Germany, Draganov, received recall orders. German leader Hitler received him yesterday, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present.

### Turkish Ambassador to Germany Presents Credentials; Ambassador to Soviet Union Arrives

Berlin, 15th, Haitong Agency: The new Turkish Ambassador to Germany, Arıkan, presented his credentials to German leader Hitler yesterday. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also attended the ceremony.

Istanbul, 15th, Haitong Agency: It is announced here that the new Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Açıkalın, arrived in Kuybyshev yesterday.

Japanese Workers' Wages Increased

Tokyo, 15th, Haitong Agency: The "Asahi Shimbun" reported that Japanese factory workers received an average wage increase of 2.4% in May of this year. The highest wage increase was in December 1939, with a general increase of 2.5%. The wage increases in May were only for construction workers, steelworkers, dockworkers, and textile workers.

### War Report from Southeastern Zhejiang: Japanese Troops Advance Towards Huabu

Japanese Front Line in Zhejiang, 15th, Allied News Agency: Japanese army units are operating in southeastern Zhejiang in two routes and have advanced to the areas of Huabu and Wangcunkou.

### Reporting Department Chief Kamada Discusses the Solomon Sea Battle

Allied News Agency: The United States recently dispatched a large fleet to the Solomon Islands to attempt a counterattack. The Japanese fleet, with a smaller force facing a larger one, still demonstrated its ever-victorious spirit in heavy fog and adverse weather, achieving significant results. Colonel Kamada, the reporting chief of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, made the following remarks:

Following the Battle of Hawaii, another great victory was achieved. The supreme might of the Japanese navy is now demonstrated to the world. In ordinary naval battles, even if there are differences in training between the two sides, it is usually not difficult to achieve very significant results. This time, in dark nights and adverse weather conditions, Japan used only a small number of warships to engage the enemy's large fleet, inflicting heavy damage. This is the result of the Japanese navy's usual intensive training. Regarding this sea battle, as detailed reports have not yet been received, it is difficult to explain the exact events. It is assumed that the Japanese fleet first discovered the enemy fleet, then braved the South China Sea's adverse weather, broke through the waves, and advanced swiftly, inflicting a swift defeat on the entire enemy fleet. This kind of naval battle is truly due to the merit of Japanese training. Compared to the actual combat strength and combat techniques of the British and American navies, the Japanese navy is truly incomparable. Why did the British and American fleets deploy to that area? This is because the United States has suffered repeated defeats, and the American people have expressed great dissatisfaction with the US Navy. As the New York Times criticized the government, "Where is the American navy?" As a result, the US Navy could no longer remain hidden, so this large fleet was dispatched. But what was the result? American newspapers are extremely pessimistic about the outcome of this sea battle. When the US authorities announced the Solomon Sea Battle, they emphasized, "This is the first major offensive by the British and American joint forces." However, regarding the results of the battle, they only issued a few words about minimal damage. American newspapers have criticized this severely, saying, "American attacks on Japan and offensives against the Japanese fleet are hopeless." The American people have been greatly shocked by this sea battle, while the British have not yet made any announcements. How the British and American navies will deploy in the future remains to be seen, but it would be irrational to attack Japanese-occupied areas. The Japanese-occupied territories are as stable as a rock, and the areas secured by the Japanese army will not be shaken by any force. However, it is not to maintain the status quo forever. The purpose of naval battles is not only to secure a certain area but also to completely destroy the enemy's last ship. Therefore, the future activity of the Japanese navy is worth looking forward to.

### Indian僑民 in Europe Issue Declaration

Berlin, 14th, Havas Agency: Indian僑民 in Europe held a meeting here yesterday. Indian figures Bala Kir Ouma and Bannerjee also attended. A decision was made to issue an official statement denouncing Britain's violent policies. The original text roughly stated that Britain's attitude in India completely proves that the United Kingdom and the United States are not fighting to defend freedom and democracy. Although Britain has adopted violent means to arrest Indian leaders, India is determined to fight for independence to the end, and will not stop until it achieves its goal. The Indians are very fortunate to have Bose (leader of the pro-Axis Nationalist Party) as their leader, roaming outside the scope of British violence.

Bangkok, 15th, Haitong Agency: Bose, chairman of the East Asian Indian Independence League, once again used Bangkok Radio yesterday to broadcast a speech to Indian compatriots, stating that the Indian war of independence is a total war, and Indians must be prepared to sacrifice everything and fight to the end. After day comes night, and before dawn there must be darkness. After you endure pain and sacrifice, the light will come. Gandhi once said that it is worth sacrificing one million of us to exchange for India's independence because the people who will be liberated will number 999 million. The world is now closely watching India's struggle for independence. If we do not give up our struggle, help will arrive. If India accepts the British compromise, it will never see the light of day again. Finally, Bose called on Jinnah, the leader of the Indian Muslim League, and the Indian princes and officials to join the Congress front and work together to oppose the British.

### Chilean President to Visit United States; Pan-American Conference Agreements May Be Implemented

Chilean Capital, 15th, Haitong News: It is announced here that Chilean President Rios has accepted President Roosevelt's invitation to visit the United States around the end of September or early October to discuss "various American issues," and a military representative will accompany him. Ríos has also accepted President Vargas' invitation to visit Brazil.

Chilean Capital, 14th, Havas News: Foreign Minister Barrios told reporters that the Chilean government may implement the agreements passed by the Pan-American Conference without waiting for parliamentary approval. When this agreement was signed, our country issued a statement that we cannot consider ourselves bound by it until it has been approved by Parliament, but at this point, it may be implemented without waiting for parliamentary approval. According to one of the agreements, the countries of the Americas should sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers.

### Argentine Military Attaché Murdered; Capital of Brazil Shaken; Body Found Outside City with Bullet Wounds to Head and Back; Government Authorities Have Begun Investigating the Truth

Capital of Brazil, 14th, Havas News: Argentine Army Attaché to Brazil, Colonel Jaime Rivarola Gaete, was murdered near here today. His body was found outside the city, with several bullet wounds to the head and back. His car was abandoned by the roadside. Government authorities have already begun investigating the truth.

### British Newspaper Urges Announcement of Post-War Plans

London, 14th, Havas News: Minister of Armaments Production Lyttelton gave a speech yesterday, warning the nation and strongly arguing that the next three months will have a decisive impact on the outcome of the current war and the future of Britain. This speech was commented on by the Times, expressing regret for the lack of organization and many shortcomings in Britain's war efforts, and stating that General Rommel's rapid advance in North Africa was largely due to the lack of organization in the British war forces. In this situation, it is not surprising that the Axis forces are approaching the gates of Alexandria. As it stands now, if we want to give a new impetus to our war effort, we must not only correct technical errors but also clearly announce post-war plans. Only when the British people understand that post-war peace is better than pre-war peace will they be able to fight with all their strength.

British and American Strategic Plans

Stockholm, 15th, Haitong News: According to London sources, well-informed British sources claim that the Anglo-Soviet agreement was signed in London on May 26. At that time, Britain hoped that the Allies would defeat General Rommel in North Africa this summer and become the masters of the Mediterranean. London and Washington also announced the Second Front Plan on June 11. However, the tank battle of Knightsbridge occurred on June 13, and Molotov was already on his way home. The United Kingdom and the United States originally planned to open a second front in the spring of 1943. Molotov's visit hastened the date of opening the second front, and Churchill's visit was also related to this plan. However, after General Rommel's victory in Libya, the strategic plans of Britain and the United States have been affected, and official documents no longer mention the opening of the second front this year.

### German Aircraft Attack Britain

Berlin, 15th, Haitong News: The German High Command announced yesterday that German light fighter planes attacked military installations in several cities on the east coast of Britain on Thursday. The public utility equipment of Eastbourne was heavily bombed, and many houses were destroyed. Another German plane was busy scouting the southeast coast of Britain and discovered many enemy ships south of Pevensey. One outpost ship steamed at full speed, attempting to evade the German plane's attack, but failed and was sunk. A ship anchored outside Pevensey harbor was also sunk. The third group of German planes bombed a concentration point of British ships at the mouth of the River Dart on the south coast, dropping a large number of bombs, and the ships were heavily damaged. On Thursday night, German planes dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on Norwich in eastern England. German planes broke through British anti-aircraft fire and anti-aircraft balloon nets at midnight, flying low and dropping bombs on important targets, causing fires in several places.

London, 14th, Havas News: According to official announcements, the result of enemy planes bombing Britain in the middle of July resulted in the death of a total of 368 civilians, including 167 men, 161 women, and 40 children, and 883 injured.

### Partial Reshuffle of Romanian Cabinet

Capital of Romania, 14th, Havas News: The cabinet was partially reshuffled today.

Argentina Requests the United States to Fulfill Vehicle Purchase Contract

Argentine Capital, 14th, Havas News: The Argentine Railway Bureau previously ordered 50 vehicles from the United States, which are now being requisitioned by the US authorities. The Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs today submitted a request to the United States, hoping to fulfill the contract. According to Washington, this move is still due to military needs, just like the vehicles manufactured for Brazil and British autonomous territories before the requisition. According to local business sources, the Argentine Railway Bureau has signed a total of 550 contracts with the United States, and the vehicles requisitioned this time are only a part of them.

### Northwest of Stalingrad: German Troops Have Crossed the Don River; Fierce Battles Surround the City

Bear City, 15th, Allied News Agency: The Soviet war last night stretched from the vicinity of Mount Elbrus (a major mountain in the Caucasus), through the distant approaches of Moscow, to Leningrad. German forces in the Caucasus, with strong air support, continued their offensive along the Rostov-to-Baku railway, 300 miles from Rostov, penetrating deeper into the Caucasus Mountains, and further approaching the Grozny oilfields, less than 200 miles from the Caspian Sea. German mechanized columns moved back and forth in the Caucasus region, attempting to sever Soviet lines of communication, particularly in the northern Caucasus. More areas there, while not actually under attack, are under threat of isolation. It is reported that German troops concentrated tank assaults 75 miles northwest of Stalingrad, have broken through and crossed the Don River. Moscow sources say that the threat to Stalingrad has thus increased. Although the fighting in the Kotelnikovo area southwest of Stalingrad is currently quiet, the Red Army newspaper "Red Star" warns that this phase of the Stalingrad battle is merely the calm before the storm. It is reported that the Germans are sending reserves to this area to reinforce the southern route of German forces encircling this Volga industrial city. The Red Army is still holding the two roads to Stalingrad, but the situation is tense. News from the surrounding areas of Krasnodar, Cherkessk, and Mineralnye Vody is scarce. It is only reported that German troops simultaneously attacked a position of Soviet forces in Krasnodar on two routes. Although they encountered strong resistance, the Germans finally broke through the Soviet defenses. Observing the current situation, the advance rate in the Cherkessk and Mineralnye Vody areas is slower, as they strive to advance along the flat grasslands suitable for tanks and motorized infantry, temporarily avoiding the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. As for the fighting near Moscow in the northwestern sector of the front, it is widely believed that the Red Army is launching counter-offensives in response to the retreat in the south. The battle line extends from Voronezh, attacking the left flank of the German forces south, through the Bryansk area, 200 miles south of Moscow, northwest to Lake Ilmen and the Leningrad siege line.

Moscow, 14th, Havas News Agency: According to a Soviet official radio broadcast today, over the past 24 hours, our troops have continued to fight in Krasnaya, northwest of Kotelnikovo, Mineralnye Vody, Cherkessk, Meypu, and Krasnodar. There have been no major changes on other fronts.

### Fierce Fighting in the Caucasus Mountains: Germans Occupy Georgievsk

Stockholm, 14th, Havas News Agency: Today marks the 418th day of the German-Soviet war. The most important development on the front is not the continued advance of German forces towards the Caucasus, but the fierce fighting around Stalingrad. German forces southwest of the city have advanced to the strongest Soviet defenses. According to Soviet sources, the German forces have not been able to break through this line of defense and have had to retreat slightly. However, the German High Command is still deploying large numbers of fresh troops to participate in the fighting, including a large number of paratroopers who have already been involved in combat in certain locations. The heavy artillery units that performed so well in the Kerch Peninsula and Sevastopol have also been transported to the Stalingrad front. Although the German forces do not consider the attack on the city to be easy, the city will ultimately suffer the same fate as other major Soviet fortresses. Assuming the city falls, it will have a very important impact on the development of the Eastern Front war. However, in any case, it will not be enough to force the Soviet Union to abandon the war and make peace, because the Soviet Union still possesses a large number of personnel, and the elite Red Army troops have not yet participated in the fighting. In recent years, the Red Army High Command has stockpiled large quantities of food, fuel, and armaments. According to a correspondent for the Stockholm Daily News in Berlin, the above-mentioned goods are all stored in northern Soviet Union, and are sufficient to sustain the Red Army's resistance until next summer.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 14th, Havas News Agency: According to military observers, the German offensive on the Caucasus front has slowed down in the past 24 hours. According to German officials, this is because the German forces need to reorganize their troops and prepare for future battles. At the same time, the increasing strength of Soviet resistance is also a factor. Currently, intense fighting is only occurring in the western Caucasus. The Soviet forces are currently conducting a rearguard action, with the intention of delaying the advance, allowing the Soviet forces to retreat to the southern Caucasus via the port of Novorossiysk or other Black Sea ports. The German forces occupying the cities of Voloshilovgrad and Meypu have already begun a rapid advance south, reaching the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains and preparing to enter the valleys. However, they have encountered resolute resistance from the Red Army. However, in certain positions, the Soviet forces have failed to fully utilize the terrain advantage of the protruding plains and have been forced to retreat to the mountains. As a result, the German forces advancing south along the Laba River reached the city of Bostmenskaya, 110 miles south of Armavir, on the 14th of this month. Also, in the Kislovodsk area, fighting has been fierce for the past five days. The Soviet forces are trying to delay the German offensive towards Grozny and Ordzhonikidze. Both sides are also actively engaged between the Kuma River and the Manych River. The German forces are consolidating their positions in the Manych River and Yergeni Hills area. Although the Soviet forces have tried their best to counterattack in an attempt to recover the area, they have not succeeded. The German forces also occupied the city of Alagir on the night of the 13th and built a bridgehead between the Manych and Kuma canals. It is reported that the main reason for the slowdown in the German offensive is that the recent advances have been too rapid, penetrating too deeply, and it is necessary to pause slightly to allow for deployment and the construction of new bases, not entirely due to the strength of Soviet resistance. It is expected that in the near future, the German forces will launch a full-scale general offensive again.

German Headquarters, 15th, Haitong News Agency: This afternoon's German military report stated that German and allied forces in the Caucasus region continued to fight fiercely in the mountains and made progress, occupying the city of Georgievsk in the northern mountains and capturing 20 heavy artillery pieces. German aircraft have contributed significantly to defeating the resisting enemy forces. Ships and retreating troops along the Black Sea coast continue to be bombed. One destroyer and four ships were sunk, and another destroyer was heavily damaged. North and northwest of Voronezh, enemy reinforcements attacked, encountering fierce resistance and retreating without success. The enemy lost 92 tanks. There were major battles east of Vyazma and near Rzhev. 83 enemy tanks were destroyed. Southeast of Lake Ilmen and on the Volkhov front, enemy forces attacked several times and were all repelled.

Berlin, 15th, Haitong News Agency: German forces currently operating in the Caucasus have occupied Georgievsk, only 200 kilometers from the Grozny oilfields, which have very rich oil reserves.

### Turkey Takes Necessary Measures; Prepares to Detain Soviet Ships; Several Small Vessels Have Entered; Will Designate Mooring in the Sea of Marmara

Ankara, 14th, Havas News Agency: It is rumored that a portion of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet has sailed from various Caucasus ports to ports in Turkish territory. In fact, as of now, no other Soviet warships have arrived, except for small warships such as the "Samaien" and "Inibol," and small boats that escaped after the fall of Sevastopol. However, Turkish naval authorities have taken all necessary measures to detain Soviet ships that subsequently seek refuge in Turkish ports, and have appointed officials specifically for this task. A special base has been designated in the Sea of Marmara, where several Soviet ships are expected to be ordered to moor. Turkish naval authorities have even reserved mooring positions and designated docks according to the tonnage of Soviet ships.

Ankara, 15th, Haitong News Agency: According to Turkish officials, the British and American governments have not raised the issue of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet passing through the Dardanelles Strait again. The Turkish government has clearly expressed its determination to adhere to the Montreux Convention. Britain and the United States are unlikely to raise this demand again.

### International Blackout Drill Held on the US-Canada Border

Lisbon, 15th, Allied News Agency: According to news from New York, an international blackout drill was held last night in the Niagara border region between the United States and Canada, lasting for thirty minutes.

Although they do not have to swear allegiance to the Quisling government, they must participate in the teachers' union led by the Quisling Party. In addition, from September 15th to October 10th, all students must participate in the autumn harvest work. As for the textbooks used, especially the history and geography textbooks of Norway and Germany, they have all been revised.

### Scenery of Stalingrad

The Battle of Stalingrad is About to Begin: Stalingrad is one of the key Soviet military industrial centers on the lower Volga River. Originally named Tsaritsyn, it was renamed Stalingrad in memory of Stalin's revolutionary achievements in defending the city in 1918.

### Japanese Army and Navy Authorities Supervise and Guide Civilian Air Defense Training; Entrust Municipal Authorities with Responsibility for Guidance; Training Plan to be Announced by Japanese Authorities

The Shanghai Times reported that after the Japanese Army and Navy authorities announced that they would take steps to train Shanghai residents in civilian air defense, the Public Concession Police Department disclosed yesterday (the 14th) that the newly appointed Assistant Commissioner of the Traffic Division of the Police Department, Gorō Matsumoto, had been appointed as the head of the Police Department's Air Defense Division, and the division began work on Thursday. From now on, Matsumoto will be responsible for all matters related to air defense, and the Traffic Division will be renamed the Traffic Air Defense Division.

### Plan Pending

The plan for training the residents of the Public Concession has not yet been formulated, as the Police Department is still awaiting instructions from the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Council will take orders from the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command here. It is expected that the Municipal Council will form a committee this month to discuss the plan and provide residents with training in blackout and other air defense preparations, regardless of the residents' nationality.

### Necessary Preparations

It is also reliably learned that although the French Consul General, Magre, has been appointed to supervise the air defense training of residents in the French Concession, an officer may be appointed to take over the technical tasks of air defense training. The announcement by the Japanese authorities stated that the air defense regulations issued by the Army and Navy Air Defense Command are aimed at completing all necessary preparations for civilian air defense drills to cope with possible air raids.

### Guiding Citizens

The Municipal Council and the French Consulate General must, in accordance with the promulgated regulations, guide civilian air defense drills, implement necessary arrangements, and facilitate air defense drills. The Japanese Consulate Police Department specializes in supervising the training of Japanese residents in Shanghai. The Air Defense Command directly supervises the Japanese Consulate Police Department, the French Consulate General, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Council.

### Installing Signals

Shanghai conducted its first trial of air raid precautions on Wednesday night. That night, the advertising signs and decorative lights in the two concessions were temporarily extinguished. The extinguishing of outdoor lights is the first type of precautionary measure that the authorities will take to prepare for air raids. Sirens have been installed in eleven locations in the city, which will be used to issue alarms or all-clear signals to warn the public.

### Shanghai West Epidemic Prevention Committee Actively Prevents Epidemics

The Shanghai West Epidemic Prevention Committee has been actively promoting epidemic prevention work for four days now. In addition to establishing isolation hospitals and mobilizing all quarantine and vaccination personnel for on-site work, it has also launched an epidemic prevention publicity week, posting and distributing various cartoons and slogans to urge residents to pay close attention: do not eat unreliable cold drinks; do not eat things that have touched raw water or wine; do not eat things that flies have landed on; always wash your hands after defecation and before eating; get vaccinated against cholera; disinfect vomit and excrement with lime before discarding; do not expose vomit and excrement on the ground; pay attention to the cleanliness of toilets, kitchens, and latrines; do not litter indiscriminately; cover food to isolate flies; do not visit patients casually; avoid going to crowded entertainment venues; do not sleep in the streets; do not be greedy for coolness; and always exterminate flies anytime, anywhere.

### Dispute Over Rent Leads to Group Violence

Zheng Zhuguo, a Chaozhou native and subtenant at No. 4, Lane 572, Fuxu Road, is engaged in pawnshop and real estate businesses. He previously sublet a room in the rear building to Zhao Zhenbiao (engaged in the cotton cloth business) from Ningbo, at a monthly rent of 75 yuan, for more than two years. They usually got along well. However, recently, Zheng earned a profit from engaging in the lottery and took in a concubine outside. He wanted to move her into the house to live with him, so he asked the Zhao family to move out. Zhao delayed for several days because it was difficult to find a house. Zheng, by nature, was violent and had repeatedly used illegal means, such as preventing the Zhao family members from entering and exiting through the main gate and turning off the lights, to pressure Zhao to move out. Zhao had always endured this silently, so no disputes arose. However, Zheng, thinking that Zhao was weak and could be bullied, on the 2nd of the month, gathered six or seven thugs and invited Zhao downstairs to discuss the matter. They disagreed and ended up resorting to violence, beating Zhao and his wife, Zhao Xu, into injuries. Afterwards, Zhao immediately filed a complaint with the court requesting an examination of the injuries and filed a lawsuit against Zheng for assault. Zheng denied committing the assault after being summoned yesterday and was ordered to try to reconcile outside the court.

### Adjusting Interbank Funds: The Silver Union Association Issues Lending Regulations; Adding Goods as a Type of Collateral; Valuation Discount Period Limited to Ten Days

In view of the fact that lending with goods as collateral is a normal part of financial operations, the Banking Joint Reserve Committee has, since December 12 of last year, handled the issue of interbank lending according to the resolution of the Silver and Money Industry Joint Association. However, due to the sudden changes in the situation at that time and the closure of warehouses, the item of goods as collateral was not included. Subsequently, the various warehouses were gradually unsealed, and the authorities successively stipulated and implemented methods for the control of various materials and the scope of such control. Now, the financial industry can properly adopt or reject commodity loans based on their types and properties, and the collateral situation can be stable. Therefore, the committee has revised the interim measures for handling interbank lending matters and added goods as collateral. These revised measures have been resolved and passed by the Interbank Lending Group Committee. However, the selection of goods should be extremely cautious. The interim measures for handling interbank lending matters are recorded as follows:

The assets in item 5 of the preceding paragraph are limited to those owned by the owner for the purpose of non-speculative hoarding.

Article 4: The total interbank lending amount for each bank or firm by the Reserve Committee shall be determined by the Interbank Lending Group Committee of the Temporary Committee, but shall not exceed the total amount of the paid-up capital and reserve funds of each bank or firm.

Article 5: The selection and valuation of interbank lending collateral shall be handled by the manager of the committee under the direction of the Interbank Lending Group Committee of the Temporary Committee. Article 6: The Reserve Committee shall, when receiving collateral as stipulated in Article 3 for interbank lending, apply the following discounts: Government securities shall be discounted by 30% of the Reserve Committee's valuation; Bonds of Chinese-owned companies shall be discounted by 40% of the Reserve Committee's valuation; Stocks of Chinese-owned companies shall be discounted by 30% of the Reserve Committee's valuation, but the valuation shall not exceed the face value; Real estate within the Shanghai Concession shall be discounted by 50% of the Reserve Committee's valuation; Public bills and treasury certificates shall be valued at 100% of their face value; Goods that can be immediately sold in this city shall be discounted by 40% of the Reserve Committee's valuation.

Essentials of Home Air Defense and Fire Protection (3)

Fire Protection: (A) Limits of the Home Air Defense Team's Mission: 1. The principle of the home air defense team is not to assist other teams. However, when incendiary bombs fall within the territory of a neighboring home air defense team and assistance is necessary, or when a fire occurs in other territories and the military or public fire departments have not yet arrived to provide assistance, and there is no need for vigilance within the team's territory, assistance may be provided. 2. After the military or public fire department begins fire protection work, the home air defense team leader shall immediately hand over all fire protection work and assist from the side in accordance with their orders. (B) Preventing Fires Caused by Incendiary Bombs: 1. The types and explosion conditions of incendiary bombs are roughly as follows. This allows identification of the type of bomb: A. Electronic incendiary bomb: Sparks fly out at the same time as ignition, burning with a white glow at high temperature; B. White phosphorus incendiary bomb: A huge explosion sound occurs at the same time as ignition, emitting a large amount of white smoke, and sparks fly to a distance, causing multiple fire points; C. Oil incendiary bomb: A large amount of black smoke and red flames are emitted at the same time as ignition. Because the burning oil flows, the fire points expand with it, or burning objects scatter, causing multiple fire points. 1. When an incendiary bomb falls, it ignites and explodes at the same time, and the fire is instantaneous and very fierce. Therefore, it is quite difficult to move it out of the house. However, if the firepower of the electronic incendiary bomb has weakened, or the white phosphorus incendiary bomb or oil incendiary bomb has already scattered, it may be removed. 3. After an incendiary bomb falls and explodes, the neighbors should be immediately notified and fire prevention work should be carried out. The home air defense team leader shall order those engaged in air defense to immediately report to the nearest police station or fire brigade. 4. Methods for preventing fires caused by incendiary bombs: Immediately pour a large amount of water on flammable materials in the surrounding area. At the same time, depending on the situation, cover the incendiary bomb directly with wet mats, sand, or soil, and then pour water to contain the flames and prevent them from spreading. Also, the sparks of electronic incendiary bombs are relatively difficult to burn on clothes, so be sure to work hard to put out the fire nearby. After the firepower of the incendiary bomb has weakened, it should be immediately moved out of the house. White phosphorus can spontaneously ignite in the air, so if it adheres to pillars or paper windows, it should be removed immediately, or extinguished first and then moved out of the house to a safe place to continue burning.

### Reviewing the Old and Knowing the New

— Yi

People who are good at reading will realize the value of the phrase "reviewing the old and knowing the new," because when we read, we inevitably miss some important parts, or do not comprehend some kind of valuable meaning. When we review, we suddenly have an understanding, which is truly the happiest thing.

In fact, reading is like this, and the married life of couples is the same. Constantly thinking about the other's strengths, constantly trying to discover the other's good points, constantly reminiscing about the situation during the courtship period or honeymoon period, then even if a conflict occurs occasionally, it can turn major events into minor ones, and minor events into nothing, and the feelings of both parties will be further advanced. This is "reviewing the old and knowing the new."

A good book can be read a hundred times without getting tired of it, a good book is worth cherishing, a good book should be read attentively. If couples treat their partner like books, then the feelings of the couple can also be "focused" and will not "change their minds," and family life can also be pure and perfect.

If a man or woman can go home early to read a book, he or she can be called "studious," and if a man or woman can take care of the happiness of his wife or husband and "keep himself pure," he or she will be a creator of a beautiful family.

### The Art of Dealing with People

— Yi

Women in Chinese families should promote herd life. Being able to get along with other women can remove many of the barriers and suspicions that are common in families. Here are a few ways to deal with people:

Show interest in the things that others love (this should of course be those that are proper).

Listen quietly to what others say. A good listener is more popular than a good speaker.

Sincerly praise others where they deserve praise. This is not just flattery.

Be loyal to friends.

Express admiration for what others have, without jealousy.

Do not criticize others behind their backs or make harmful remarks about them.

Help people where you can.

Be able to study an academic subject or skill together.

Editor Sir, After reading an article titled "Between Sisters-in-Law" in your esteemed publication last time, I couldn't help but have my inner pain stirred up, prompting me to write this piece about "Between Brothers."

My mother gave birth to a total of eight sons. I am the second eldest. Fortunately, I stepped into the gates of university learning last year. My eldest brother, unable to withstand the physical strain, only studied at university for a year before going into business. My third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh brothers are all in school, ranging from middle school to kindergarten. Thanks to Heaven's blessings, my hardworking father can support such a heavy burden of life. In his old man's bitter smile, there is bright hope, looking forward to the few older sons being able to quickly take over when he can no longer support it. Fortunately, he has not failed his old man's expectations. My eldest brother has already contributed a little to ease his old man's breathing. So, isn't this a "happy" family? But alas, deep in my heart, I deeply feel a hidden sorrow. I deeply know that between my eldest brother, myself, and my third brother, due to different personalities, there remains a kind of invisible "boundary." I cannot say what my eldest brother is like, let alone what my third brother is like. I only know that I am in the most embarrassing position. Those who know me should be able to understand me. My eldest brother does not approve of my entering university. This is a layer of estrangement between me and my eldest brother. In addition, the incompatibility of personalities deepens it further. As for my third brother, his solitary nature is indifferent to the feelings between brothers. I dare say that his solitary nature is harmed by "studying to death." He gets first place every year and rarely consults about anything other than studying. Therefore, as an elder brother, I cannot help but nag. But I immediately realize that my nagging can only deepen the marks. However, after I excessively do household chores, I still can't help but say a few words to him, "Move your hands and share the joys and hardships." Although what I say makes him unhappy, my work impresses him. Now, he surprisingly learns to wash his own clothes, indirectly reducing the hardship of our old mother. In short, there is an unnameable "boundary" left between the three of us. We live together with superficial harmony but discord at heart. My eldest brother leaves early and returns late. I help my mother with work (on days without classes), so there are few opportunities to talk earnestly. At the same time, I ask the wise editors to encourage me and guide me so that I can return to the happy and carefree heart of my childhood.

Respectfully submitted by Family Reader Xi Xi

Mr. Xi Xi: You have written your family affairs in detail, unintentionally revealing your disposition. You are an emotionally rich young man, mindful of the hardships of your parents, and hoping that eight brothers and sisters can work together to build a happy family. What a great and admirable goal! However, your observation of your brothers does not seem to be thoroughly understood: For the sake of your family's happiness, we cannot help but correct it! Your eldest brother's disapproval of you entering university may be due to the difficulty of the family finances. During these long four years of university study, not only can you not share the burden of the family, but they also have to raise this very difficult tuition fee. People often complain because they do not have enough strength or are in a bad mood. You should understand them and not wrongly blame or misunderstand your eldest brother for not supporting your studies. Your third brother gets first place every year. This is a great honor for your family. Because he is focused on his studies, he inevitably neglects household affairs. However, you are his elder brother. Seeing such achievements from your third brother, you should show more joy and do your best to encourage him. Why do you blame him for "studying to death"? The lack of opportunities for earnest conversations may also be one of the reasons why estrangement easily occurs between brothers. If you can increase the opportunities for earnest conversations and treat each other with a spirit of sincerity and love, understanding and encouragement, it will be of great help in eliminating suspicion, dispelling misunderstandings, enhancing feelings between each other, and creating a happy and fulfilling family. In addition, it should be mentioned in passing that the newspaper's student aid fund for university students is still open for applications (deadline is the 20th of this month). If your eldest brother's dissatisfaction with you entering university is indeed due to family finances, and your own conduct and academic performance also meet the conditions for applying for aid, then you may as well apply according to the regulations. Because whether the application is approved or not, your brothers will always approve of and have good feelings about this kind of action. (Editor)

### Preventing the Spread of Infectious Diseases (Part 1)

— Ding Fubao

"Preventing the Spread of Infectious Diseases" is a chapter from Mr. Ding Fubao's book "How to Create My Healthy Life." The book is published by the Medical Bookstore and consists of twenty chapters. Based on his life's research and experiences, it provides the most clear and detailed explanation of life cultivation and health care. It is truly a bright light guiding a healthy life. In these days when the atmosphere of epidemics is spreading, it is especially a valuable work. This book is a commemorative gift for the old gentleman's 69th birthday, and it was distributed to relatives and friends who donated to the newspaper's student aid fund and the Shanghai Fuyouyuan yesterday as a birthday gift. (Editor)

Among all the calamities that harm people's lives, none is worse than infectious diseases. However, if prevention is done properly, it is not impossible to avoid them. The poisonous harm of infectious diseases spreads from one person and one family to all directions, and the loss of national strength is immeasurable. Now, I will briefly describe the types of infectious viruses and what methods can be used to prevent them. Preventing harm before it arises, may all of you record this to remember this!

For those who have pathogens of dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever, the following should be observed:

Toilets should be used exclusively if possible. Each time the toilet is used, disinfectant should be added to the toilet bowl. Hand washing water in the toilet must use disinfectant. The toilet bowl must be disinfected after each use. Anything soiled by feces must be disinfected.

For those who have pathogens of diphtheria and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, the following should be observed:

Dishes, towels, clothes, bedding, bibs, toys, etc. should be used exclusively. Bedding should be exposed to sunlight often. Cloth scraps, paper scraps, and other items contaminated with nasal mucus and sputum must be disinfected or thrown into the toilet. Do not go to theaters, entertainment venues, movie theaters, and other places where crowds gather.

For the homes of those who have contracted infectious diseases, or those who have died from infectious diseases, and other places suspected of being contaminated with infectious viruses, the following cleaning methods should be implemented:

For cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever, well curbs, well runoff, sewers, sewage pits, toilets, garbage cans, or unclean places must be cleaned. If necessary, they must be repaired and the wells dredged, and flies must be removed and the places where flies are easy to breed must be cleaned. For smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, clothes, bedding, toys, mats, and rugs must be cleaned. For typhus fever, lice must be removed, and clothes, bedding, etc. that easily harbor lice must be cleaned. For plague, rodents, fleas, and bedbugs should be exterminated, and clothes, bedding, mats, rugs, floors, and other items and places that easily harbor fleas and bedbugs should be cleaned or removed. Ensure that there is plenty of light and ventilation in the room.

For example, take one drop of stool from a cholera patient (cholera vomiting and diarrhea) and view it under a microscope. You will see countless microorganisms moving around. If you take this stool, boil it, or add a little lime to it, and then view it under a microscope again, all the previously moving microorganisms will stop, and only countless (-) shaped objects will be arranged in a row. These are the corpses of the microorganisms killed by the lime and boiling. This phenomenon is only found in the stool of cholera patients. The stool of ordinary diarrhea patients cannot be seen. It is called cholera bacteria, or simply cholera bacteria. If you take this cholera bacteria and mix it with food and feed it to a mouse, the mouse will develop diarrhea and die in a short time. From this, it can be seen that the cause of infectious diseases must be microorganisms (i.e., bacteria).

There are four types of disinfection methods: incineration disinfection, steam disinfection, boiling disinfection, and drug disinfection. Incineration disinfection is the method of burning contaminated virus substances. Steam disinfection is the use of circulating steam, be sure to remove the air in the sterilizer, touching above 100 degrees Celsius for more than an hour, at this time the following should be noted:

Avoid objects that may fade due to disinfection, or objects that may dye other objects, or mixed with other objects.

Pre-inspect sleeves or pockets and remove substances that are prone to explode or catch fire.

Boiling disinfection: Completely immerse the substances to be disinfected in water and boil for at least half an hour. The drugs used for drug disinfection, their preparation, and usage are as follows:

Carbolic acid water (3 parts of carbolic acid for disinfection, 97 parts of water). To prepare it, add a small amount of warm water to 3 parts of carbolic acid for disinfection that has become liquid after heating, shake or stir, and slowly pour in the whole amount of water. The water must be shaken each time it is used.

Cresol oil water (3 parts of cresol phenol soap solution, 7 parts of water (it can be made only by dissolving and diluting, but it still needs to be shaken when used.)

Mercuric chloride water (1 part of mercuric chloride water, 1 part of common salt, 100 parts of water). To prepare it, take 1 part each of mercuric chloride and salt, place them in a container, add 100 parts of water, and use scarlet color or fuchsine to prevent misuse. Also, mercuric chloride tablets (one tablet contains 0.5 part) can dissolve about 500 parts of water. This water can also corrode metals, so it should not be stored in metal containers.

Calcined lime (which heats up and crumbles when a small amount of water is added) such as making calcined lime powder, a small amount of water can be added to the calcined lime when it is used to turn it into powder (add 900 cubic centimeters of water to 1 unit). Lime milk should be prepared with 2 parts of calcined lime and 8 parts of water for use, and mix fully before using. Even if calcined lime cannot be obtained, twice the amount of ordinary lime can be used instead.

Chlorinated lime: Mix 5 parts of chlorinated lime with 95 parts of water and stir when using.

Formaldehyde solution water: Mix 1 part of formaldehyde solution with 34 parts of water when using.

### One Week Family Menu

— Ms. Huaying

This summer, the price of watermelon is shockingly expensive. Before, two or three dollars could buy a load, but now it's not even enough to buy one. It's really something people can't even dream of. Since watermelon prices are so expensive, those who are fortunate enough to eat watermelon should also cherish the watermelon rind and seeds a little, and not discard them casually: because watermelon seeds can be used as snacks, and watermelon rind can be used as a dish. Cut the watermelon rind into thin strips (the thinner the better), and stir-fry it with shredded meat; cut the watermelon rind into small squares and stir-fry it with edamame, both of which are crisp and flavorful and can be eaten with rice. If you want something simpler, cut the watermelon rind into thin small squares, soak them in salt water or soy sauce, and take them out after they are soaked through, and eat them with tea-soaked rice. It's clear and refreshing; if you pickle them with sweet sauce, then they are sweet and delicious, and even more palatable.

Preparation: Mix the sweet potato flour and water chestnut flour in an 8:2 ratio, add an appropriate amount of sugar, then mix with water to form a thick paste, spread it flat in a steamer (with a clean cloth underneath), and steam until cooked. If you like to eat with a filling, you can add a layer of red bean paste in the middle, but the procedure is slightly more troublesome. Sweet potato flour only costs 1.56 yuan per catty. The preparation is simple, the price is low, and the quality is good. It can greatly supplement the current shortage of grain.

### (208) Corn Noodle Strips

Preparation: Mix an appropriate amount of flour into the corn flour, and mix with water to form a clay-like consistency to make it sticky. Pinch into small pieces and knead into thin strips about one and a half inches long. Separately, cut the Xuecai and winter bamboo shoots into small pieces and cook them in a soup. After boiling, add soy sauce essence or MSG. Then pour in the corn noodle strips and cook until done. This kind of food is not only necessary during times of rice shortage, but also can be made and eaten often at ordinary times, because it is cheap and delicious.

### Health Exercise Method (8)

The complete set of 27 types of Maxick's health exercise method has been published in this issue. Within the period of continuous publication, many readers sent letters requesting supplements. Among them, the number of people who needed to supplement the first two issues was particularly large. From this, it can be seen that readers are eager for health needs, and how to ensure health is especially a concern for the requesters. The newspaper has limited copies, and it is difficult to handle supplementary reports one by one. However, since health is not only related to personal lifelong happiness, but also has a very close relationship with the family and the entire society, in order to universally promote it and to prevent the requesters from being disappointed, it is planned to issue a separate edition. Preparations have already begun and the book will be published soon. Please pay attention to readers. The 25th style published in this issue can promote the function of various parts of the internal organs. Although the method is similar to the 24th style, the direction of muscle activity is different. In addition to having the functions of the 24th and 25th styles, the 26th style can also make the spine extremely tough and can reduce unsightly postures in the hips and thighs. The knees should not be bent when doing it, the toes should not touch the ground, and when the legs are separated, the distance between the legs should be as far as possible without losing balance.

Maxick's health method does not seek more on the same style of action, but only pays attention to the change of action. Therefore, as long as all 27 styles can be practiced skillfully without interruption, the muscles of all parts of the body will become strong. Therefore, functional flexibility, physical strength, good digestion, and smooth excretion are the natural results of good health.
