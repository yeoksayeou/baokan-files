### Bombay Chamber of Commerce Asks the Viceroy to Reopen Negotiations with Gandhi; Rumors of New Proposals from the United States; Severe Situation Unabated in Various Parts of India

Xiongcheng (presumably a misspelling of 熊城 or 雄城 which is an old name of New York city) 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to sources in Bombay, the Bombay Indian Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the British Governor-General today, urging him to reopen negotiations with Gandhi. The telegram suggested that negotiations should start from the point where the talks with Cripps broke down, and that Gandhi and the Governor-General should have the convenience of exchanging drafts to gather opinions from all parties and achieve a peaceful resolution.

Bangkok, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - In view of the increasingly chaotic situation in India, the Bombay Chamber of Commerce has asked the Governor-General of India to begin negotiations with Gandhi in the hope of averting a crisis.

Stockholm, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - According to a report from the London correspondent of a local evening newspaper, although Britain is trying to localize the Indian riots, the rebellion is about to spread across the country. The enthusiasm of the Indian people has reached its peak, and the situation is extremely chaotic. The United States is now working on new proposals in the hope of resolving the Indian issue before the situation becomes uncontrollable, but it seems unlikely that Britain will accept them. The British authorities are maintaining silence on this matter.

Cairo, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - The well-known newspaper "Al-Ahram" recently published an article stating that the Egyptian Prime Minister, Nahas Pasha, attempted to mediate between Britain and India, but to no avail. It is known that Nahas is a close friend of Nehru, the leader of the Indian National Congress, and has repeatedly urged Nehru to change his course and adopt a more moderate attitude. Unfortunately, there is currently no room for compromise between the Congress Party and the Governor-General of India, and his efforts were ultimately futile.

Buenos Aires, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - The anti-British struggle in India has caused great concern among the American people. What the United States is currently worried about is that the struggle in India will greatly harm India's contribution to the Allied war effort, especially its production capacity. A mediation by the United States between the Governor-General's office and the Congress Party might have been possible in the past, but now that Gandhi and others have been arrested, it has become an internal affair. Therefore, the United States has no room for mediation. However, some people say that Roosevelt will personally write to Gandhi, asking him to stop the non-cooperation movement. In addition, former US special envoy to India, Grady, reported to Roosevelt on the industrialization of India, saying that it was very promising and that it had a considerable capacity for weapons production. Therefore, India could make a greater contribution to the Allied war effort in the future. However, the occurrence of this incident will inevitably reduce India's productivity, which is what the United States is most concerned about.

New Delhi, 13th, Havas News Agency Electricity - British officials recently announced that the whole city was peaceful this morning and no new incidents had occurred. A small number of small shops in the old city have reopened. The Governor-General's Office is now trying to get other grocery stores selling daily necessities to reopen. The military and police are able to control the overall situation.

Lisbon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - According to news from Washington, the US State Department stated last night that the US military's entry into India is to fight against the Axis powers. Therefore, the US military has been ordered not to interfere in the riots in India. The US military is in India to protect India, but if there are disturbances in the US military's defense zone, the US military can take necessary measures to defend itself and protect American citizens.

Riots Continue to Occur

Bern, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - According to news received from India, the Indian people took to the streets again today to hold demonstrations. Clashes between the people and the police continued to occur. The situation in various places is summarized as follows: In Bombay, the crowd attacked a police patrol, and the police were forced to open fire to suppress them. Fortunately, there were no casualties. In a certain district, the police stopped the people from demonstrating, and the people attacked troop carriers with stones. The police had to open fire again to deter them. According to official reports, there were some casualties. In addition, a large number of people surrounded the post office. The police drove there and opened fire, dispersing the crowd. One hundred and fifty rioters were arrested on the spot. The telegraph and telephone lines in the northern suburbs of Bombay were cut off and were only repaired after several hours. In New Delhi, the banks remained closed today because the people were holding demonstrations. When the people attacked the post office, the police opened fire to disperse them, killing one civilian and injuring one. In a certain place, someone on the roof attacked the police representatives with stones, and the police immediately opened fire on them. Fortunately, there were no deaths. The military patrolled the residential areas day and night. Riots broke out in various parts of Delhi. The police opened fire to suppress them. The shops in the city remained closed. Heavy troops and police were stationed in the suburbs to prevent accidents. The authorities have not yet released a list of civilian casualties, only stating that several people were killed or injured in Bombay and at least twelve people were killed in Delhi. The British authorities have taken further measures to cope with the current situation. Both Sindh and Bombay provinces have declared a state of emergency. Anyone who commits arson or vandalism will be punished with flogging, and a curfew will be imposed at night. Those who privately possess weapons will also be severely punished.

Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - The fighting situation in various parts of India is becoming more and more intense. Conflicts between Indian people and the police have occurred one after another, resulting in many casualties. The strikes and work stoppages in important industrial cities such as Bombay and Calcutta are expanding, which greatly affects India's wartime production. According to Reuters, many factories in India have been shut down due to worker strikes. The fighting among Indians seems to be the fiercest in the capital, New Delhi. On the 12th, the National People's Assembly Hall was set on fire by the crowd. The situation in the city is extremely chaotic. Two banks were also closed on the 11th. The bank committees are currently discussing countermeasures. When the people attacked the post office, they moved the stamps, postcards, and other mails out and threw them into the fire on the street. In addition, they attacked the railway and the tax office, etc., and clashed with the police, killing at least thirty-five people and injuring hundreds. The British authorities believe that Congress Party members are secretly active in the city, which may make the situation more serious. They have ordered citizens to stay indoors. As for the town of Pune in Bombay Province, the people attacked six police stations. The police immediately opened fire, injuring two people. The British authorities have ordered the arrest of rioters throughout Bombay Province, and 400 people have already been arrested. In the city of Lucknow, United Province, a group of university students attacked the railway station and destroyed the ticket office, but were stopped by the police. Anti-British incidents have occurred in countless other places. Although the British Indian authorities have always tried their best to suppress them, they have not achieved any effect.

Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to news from New Delhi, the anti-British struggle in various parts of India is intensifying. The Governor-General of India has issued a proclamation stating that offenders will be punished immediately after being caught and that the military is officially authorized to open fire to defend its own safety. According to official announcements, as of now, a total of thirty-one Indian people have been killed, 250 injured, and about 500 arrested. In reality, the number may be higher.

Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to a New Delhi dispatch, British military police continued to arrest five Congress Party leaders in Calcutta.

Stockholm, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - Although the London news received here last night claimed that the news about the Indian riots was mostly exaggerated, the news from Britain, even from the British side, unanimously acknowledged that the situation in Delhi and Patna has become more serious in the past twenty-four hours.

Saigon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - Recent dispatches from New Delhi state that the Indian riots are spreading and there are constant occurrences of stoning, arson, and strikes, as well as attacks on individuals and police vehicles. The face of New Delhi has completely changed. Shops are closed all day, and military police patrol the entire city. Several districts in the city are closed off, and pedestrians and vehicles are prohibited from passing through. Since the crowds set fire to the municipal office, the railway bureau, the clock tower, trams, and military vehicles, the military's vigilance has become even more intense.

### British India Office Releases Statement on Indian Situation; Confirms Order is Seriously Chaotic in Various Locations but Claims the Government is in Control of the Overall Situation

London, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - The India Office issued a communiqué this morning stating that "the government is able to control the overall situation in India." At the same time, Reuters announced that the backlash from the initial measures taken by the Governor-General of India was not as serious as initially expected. Although it is true that various serious incidents have occurred throughout India, their scope is limited to major cities, especially Bombay, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Pune, Delhi, and Kanpur. Disturbances in other industrial areas are also expected. The good order maintained in Punjab, Bengal, Bihar, and Madras is a good sign. In short, the situation in India is changing rapidly every day, and it is impossible to make a final judgment. But no matter how chaotic the order is, the government is able to control the overall situation.

Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to news from London, the British Indian Affairs Officer issued a statement yesterday, stating that India has been properly controlled and denying any complex situation of bloodshed. The demonstrations are only intermittent and are caused by rioters and radical students. He also said that the claim that "chaos is spreading throughout India" is completely unfounded. The so-called intermittent demonstrations have been confirmed by the latest official news from India.

Berlin Political Circles

Closely Monitor

Bern, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - The "Basel News" today published a report from Berlin correspondent Ray stating that German political figures are closely monitoring the events in India. According to German experts on Indian issues, the majority of the Indian people support Mahatma Gandhi and the National Congress Party, which can be corroborated by various news reports received. The entire country of India is currently engaged in passive resistance, strikes, and sabotage. These actions first occurred in major cities and have now spread to various provinces. The evolution of the political situation in India will have a very serious impact on Britain's defensive position, but it is still difficult to make wild guesses at this time. In any case, the importance of the Indian incident is felt far beyond India, which can be asserted.

Alliance in the United States

Issues Statement

Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the Indian Alliance in the United States held an emergency meeting on the 12th and issued a statement on the British authorities' illegal arrest of Gandhi, Nehru, Acharya, and other Indian leaders, as follows: Britain is using suppressive measures to suppress the Indian people's demand for freedom. This move makes Britain permanently abandon the only hope of resolving India. A tragic struggle has already begun, which is the inevitable result of Cripps's failure. The current crisis between Britain and India indicates that the British government cannot change its centuries-old imperialist policy.

Manila, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - Swani, the director of the Philippine branch of the Indian Independence League, gave a broadcast speech here last night, calling on the Indian people to rise up in time to fight for freedom.

### Pacific Military Conference; Reviewing the Solomon Islands Campaign

Tokyo, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to naval sources, the Japanese General Headquarters originally planned to announce the details of the Solomon Islands campaign this afternoon, but it has been postponed. However, it may be announced tomorrow.

Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt convened a Pacific military conference yesterday, presumably based on the latest information received, to discuss the Solomon Islands campaign. This meeting is held once a week, but it was not held last week due to the President's busy schedule.

Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency Electricity - According to news from Washington, Roosevelt convened a Pacific military conference at the White House on the 12th to discuss important current issues. Reuters reported that the meeting focused on reviewing the news of the Solomon Islands naval battle. The United States initially only announced that the battle was still in progress. The Navy Department subsequently announced on the 10th that it had not yet received detailed reports, and the situation was unclear. It also stated that US destroyers, cruisers, and transport ships had been sunk or damaged. However, neutral parties believe that this announcement is pessimistic news from the United States. Apart from reviewing the Solomon Islands naval battle, there were no specific reports on the results of the Pacific military conference. This may reflect the unfavorable battle situation.

Saigon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - Although the Allied propaganda still claims that the Allied forces are making smooth progress in the Solomon Islands naval battle, Australian officials are warning people not to be optimistic, as the losses suffered may be greater than expected.

### US and Australia Exchange Staff Officers; Australian Prime Minister Curtin's Speech

Saigon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - A Sydney dispatch states that the Allied forces in Australia have now formulated a thorough plan to exchange US and Australian staff officers, so that the staff officers of both countries can mutually understand each other's war organization and strategy. At the same time, some US military personnel will be trained in Australian schools.

Saigon, 13th, Haitong News Agency Electricity - Australian Prime Minister Curtin said in a speech at the centenary banquet of the Melbourne City Council, "No one of the Allied countries can stand alone. The various dangers of future victory must be shared equally by the Allied countries. Whether the hopes for the next century can be realized or diminished will depend on how the countries leading us in the war distribute their tasks. The US, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and other autonomous territories are deeply aware of Australia's situation, and the Australian government is also deeply aware of the situation of other Allied countries. Australia and New Zealand have now become fortresses that the Allied countries cannot abandon. I firmly believe that the leaders of Britain and the United States feel the same as I do."

Bilbao, 12th, Havas News Agency Electricity - Australian newspapers, especially those in Sydney, have unanimously protested against the government's news censorship measures. Today, the newspapers published an article written by former Prime Minister Hughes, attacking the government for publishing false reports on the development of the Pacific war situation. Prime Minister Curtin recently issued a statement refuting it, stating, "Australian news censorship never censors political news. As for other issues, especially news involving military issues, the news censor must decide whether to publish them."

### Recent Situation in Medan

Medan, 13th, Allied News Agency Electricity - Medan is the only large city in northern Sumatra. Every day, at dawn, the public market in the city center is crowded with people who begin to buy and sell. The market is 33 meters wide and 160 meters long. The size of the scale is imaginable. The items in the market are all kinds of vegetables. In addition to fish, meat, tomatoes, and cucumbers, there are also many foods unique to Southeast Asia. The smell of coconut oil on the indigenous residents is difficult for newcomers to get used to. At the same time, the noisy shouts often cause headaches. However, the exchange of these sounds and smells is precisely the driving force for building a new Medan. Jalan Mojong, the commercial center of the city, is lined with shops of all sizes. The colorful clothing materials are especially eye-catching. The overseas Chinese live in the southern part of the city. They work hard in business, but since the merger and unification of various small-scale overseas Chinese associations, the 35,000 overseas Chinese in the city also have the need to improve their lives. At the same time, they can also actively cooperate in the construction of Medan.

### The Siege of Tuapse Begins; The Black Sea Coast Becomes a Fiery Pit; There is No Decisive Victory in the Don Bend; The Soviet Offensive in the Kerch Peninsula Expands

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, Havas, 12th: The 415th day of the war on the Eastern Front. German forces are advancing towards the Black Sea coast, aiming for Tuapse and Novorossiysk. South of Melitopol, the Red Army continues to retreat towards Tuapse, but the German forces are very close to the city, and the siege has already begun. In Krasnodar, the German forces encountered fierce resistance from the Red Army. The Red Army is clearly determined to defend Novorossiysk at a heavy price. So far, the Red Army's strategy has been to delay time, with its rearguard sacrificing itself in covering battles to consolidate the road to Novorossiysk. At the same time, the hard-pressed defenders of western Caucasus are embarking and retreating southward. In fact, this retreat is taking place in every port along the Black Sea coast, with all ships, large and small, being used up. The German air force is constantly bombing Red Army units and various ports where they are embarking for retreat. The Black Sea coast has become a fiery pit, with the Red Army suffering heavy losses under the bombing. The situation in the Pyatigorsk region is unclear, but there are reasons to believe that the German forces are taking advantage of the terrain to advance rapidly towards the Caspian Sea coast. According to Italian sources, the oil refining facilities in the Grozny region, on the German offensive route, have been set ablaze by the Red Army. On the Stalingrad front, although the German forces are making a full-scale advance in the Don River bend area, there has been no decisive victory. The German forces are attacking this fortress in three routes, attempting to combine frontal attacks with encirclement tactics along the Volga River. It is noteworthy that a piece of land between the Don River bend and the Volga River was cultivated by farmers this year, indicating that the highest authorities of the Red Army had anticipated that this area would become a battlefield since last winter. At the same time, the view that the Red Army is sacrificing the defense of the Caucasus in order to consolidate the defensive center of Stalingrad has also been confirmed. The Red Army's offensive in the Kerch Peninsula has expanded and has the appearance of a counter-offensive. The Red Army is constantly sending fresh troops to open a gap in the German positions and force the Germans to transfer troops from the southern route to aid. However, the German forces are still able to control the overall situation.

Headquarters of the German Leader, 13th, Havas News Agency: The German military report this afternoon stated that German and friendly forces are pressing the retreating enemy forces in the Caucasus region. A large Soviet force was annihilated yesterday. The German mechanized units north of the Manych River are making rapid progress, occupying the city of Elista, the capital of the Kalmyk region. German aircraft also attacked ships in northern Caucasus and the Kerch Strait. Three coastal ships were sunk, and three ships were hit and caught fire. Between the Volga and Don Rivers, the German-Romanian allied forces fiercely attacked the enemy's strongholds and made further progress. The Soviet air force attempted to attack German airfields and had twenty-eight planes shot down. The fighting in the Voronezh region has intensified. Enemy reinforcements launched an attack with large tank formations. Our troops bravely countered the attack. German aircraft carried out heavy bombing, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, who retreated without success. On August 11th and 12th, 234 enemy tanks were destroyed. Southeast and north of Kerch, enemy forces attacked our positions. Our infantry and armored units calmly countered the attack. Yesterday, 71 enemy tanks were destroyed.

Germany Will Launch a Pincer Attack on Stalingrad, Berlin, 13th, Havas News Agency: The German command reported yesterday that the Soviet 62nd Army and a part of the Soviet 1st Army were encircled west of Kalach-na-Donu in the Don River basin. Therefore, the German forces that were previously operating west of Kalach can now be transferred elsewhere. The Soviet forces should now know that the temporary halt of German operations in the Don River basin is not due to the effectiveness of the Soviet resistance, but due to the strategy of the German command. The crisis in Stalingrad is becoming increasingly acute. The Don River is the last defensive line for the German advance towards the city. Another part of the German forces advancing south of the Don River is located south of Stalingrad and will launch a new offensive against the city. Therefore, it is expected that when the German forces launch a general offensive on Stalingrad, they will launch a pincer attack at several points simultaneously. After the Soviet forces encircled west of Kalach were annihilated, the remaining Soviet strength in the Don River basin is weak and insufficient to prevent the German forces from operating in the area. Military circles in Berlin pointed out that the number of prisoners captured in the battle west of Kalach is not proportional to the spoils seized, suggesting that the Soviet forces are fighting to the death on Stalin's orders. The heavy losses of Soviet war equipment are making the defense of Stalingrad increasingly difficult. German forces on the Caucasus front have advanced to a vast mountain range. The vanguard of the German forces in western Caucasus is advancing south in the villages at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains. The German military authorities do not disclose the current position of the army to avoid divulging military secrets to the enemy. Therefore, the news that the current fighting is for control of the key passes in the southern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains is neither confirmed nor denied by Berlin. According to the latest news received here, the German forces in the central Caucasus front have entered the Caucasus and are now advancing towards the Elbrus Mountains. The highest peak of the mountain range, Mount Elbrus, reaches a height of 18,600 feet. The German forces advancing eastward in northern Caucasus are making rapid progress. Their vanguard has reached the city of Talek River district, and the upper reaches of the Kuma River have also become a war zone. It is also reported that the area around Lake Manych has been crossed by German forces, and the army has now entered the Kalmyk Republic region. It is believed here that the Soviet claim that the Soviet forces are making an orderly retreat in northern Caucasus to protect Stalingrad and the oil fields of Transcaucasia is completely inaccurate. In addition, the Soviet claim that the retreat of the Soviet forces from northern Caucasus is a strategy of Timoshenko is also unreasonable. Even the most incompetent military strategist like Timoshenko knows that the retreat of the Soviet forces from northern Caucasus would cut off the connection between the Soviet mainland and the Caucasian oil fields.

Stalingrad

Stalingrad is an important Soviet industrial center in the lower reaches of the Volga River. Originally named Tsaritsyn, it was renamed Stalingrad in memory of Stalin's revolutionary achievements in defending the city in 1918. After two five-year plans, machine factories, shipyards, and cotton mills were established one after another. After the revolutionary war, the city was completely transformed, with wide avenues and beautiful parks. In addition to being an industrial center, the city is also a cultural city, with universities, research institutes, theaters, and the Stalin Museum, which houses many valuable historical documents.

### The Soviet Black Sea Fleet Plans to Sail to the Mediterranean; Reportedly Requested Passage Through the Straits; The Turkish Government Should Deal With It Carefully

Zurich, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to the Swiss Basel News, the Soviet government has requested Yakalin, the new Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union in Kuibyshev, that the Turkish government allow the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to pass through the Bosphorus Strait to join the Allied forces in the Mediterranean. However, the Turkish government in Ankara may not agree. At the same time, it is also reported that the Turkish authorities have begun to prepare for defense on the Soviet and Iranian borders as a precautionary measure. According to a Berlin dispatch, it is rumored that the British and American ambassadors to Turkey have also strongly demanded that the Turkish government allow the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to pass through the Bosphorus Strait. Therefore, if the Turkish government agrees to this request, it will inevitably cause a serious dispute between Germany and Turkey. The Turkish government is currently dealing with this matter with extreme caution. According to the Ankara dispatch in the Berlin National News of the 13th, it is rumored that the Turkish government will reject this request based on the Montreux Convention. The German government also issued a statement on the 12th, expressing its belief that Turkey will adhere to its neutral policy.

Berlin, 12th, Havas News Agency: Semi-official sources here recently released information stating that the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union may have discussed the issue of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet seeking refuge in the Mediterranean. It is rumored that a request will be made to the Turkish government to allow passage through the straits. Turkey, on the other hand, has always maintained a neutral attitude, and there are currently no signs of changing its position.

German Estimates of Soviet Losses

Berlin, 13th, Havas News Agency: Military sources estimate that since the outbreak of the Soviet war, the Soviet Union has lost 100 million people. The number of Soviet soldiers killed, wounded, and captured is estimated to be between 12 million and 14 million. There are also 90 million Soviet people in the German-occupied areas, totaling about 100 million. The area of Soviet land occupied by the German army and its allies is about 1.4 million square kilometers, which is approximately equal to the area of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France combined.

### American Political Commentator Assesses the Situation on the Eastern Front

Lisbon, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to news from New York, Boston radio commentator Hood commented yesterday on the possibility of German forces advancing towards Novorossiysk, the Soviet naval base on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, stating that the situation in the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly critical. The Soviet attempt to use cavalry to contain the advance of German armored forces is a risky experiment. The Soviet forces have concentrated all of their tank forces around Stalingrad. The result of this strategy is that the German forces have an opportunity to threaten the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast, which is the last good port held by the Soviet forces on the Black Sea coast. If the German forces can consolidate their captured strongholds, they can occupy the Black Sea coast and then advance towards the Caucasus. After that, the German forces can drive straight into Iran, Iraq, and Syria without having to go through Turkey. The German forces can also cross the sea and directly seize the Baku oil fields. The political commentator concluded that the German forces have this possibility. Therefore, the Soviet Union is sparing no effort in demanding that the Allied forces open a second front.

### Soviet Forces Attack Hungarian and Finnish Positions

Budapest, 12th, Havas News Agency: The General Command released a military report stating that after a long period of silence, fierce fighting has broken out again on the front held by the Hungarian troops on the Eastern Front. The Red Army launched a fierce attack on our positions under the cover of armored units, but was unsuccessful. The intensity of the fighting is still increasing.

Helsinki, 12th, Havas News Agency: A military report stated that the Red Army launched repeated attacks on the Isthmus of Ounas yesterday, but were repelled by our troops. Both sides' patrols are extremely active. On the southern route of the northern front, our artillery destroyed many enemy bunkers. The Finnish coastal artillery continuously bombarded enemy ships in Kronstadt.

Most of the Serbian Rebels Have Been Eliminated

Berlin, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to sources in German military circles, the suppression of the uprising in the Herzegovina and southern Bosnia regions has been progressing smoothly for several weeks. The German and Croatian forces are advancing systematically, driving the rebels into the Sarajevo region. Some of the rebels fighting in the remote mountainous regions and sparsely populated villages have been encircled and eliminated. Most of the rebels in the deep forests of the south have also been annihilated. A large number of farmers in the area have now moved to the German-occupied areas. A British officer attempting to maintain contact with the rebels was captured in Mostar by anti-communist forces. During the period from July 23 to August 8, 3,000 rebels were annihilated and 9,700 were wounded. Acts of sabotage that hindered the harvest were also detected and stopped early, so the harvest work is now progressing smoothly.

### The Issue of Opening a Second Front Attracts Attention in French Political Circles; US Army Department Representative Barnes Arrives in England to Discuss the Adjustment of Military Production Between the Two Countries

Vichy, 13th, Havas News Agency: The issue of opening a second front in Europe has now attracted attention in French political circles, because American newspapers claim that the second front will be opened in France, so that the French can provide assistance to the landing troops. Political circles here are very disgusted with the American propaganda, spreading rumors to sway the French. One message claims that after the British and American troops land in France, the French government and the French army will maintain neutrality, and that French leader Laval also made this claim. Regarding this matter, the French Foreign Ministry has denied it to the US State Department. The French government has repeatedly declared that France will resist troops that invade its territory, and that those who want to incite rebellion or invade France in French territory will be greatly disappointed. The French army is capable of protecting French territory and suppressing rebellion.

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to news from the Swedish newspaper "War in London", the discussion of opening a second front in Europe has once again gained momentum in the British Isles, but it is being discussed from a negative perspective, such as the issue of ship space requirements. Major General Bowen, a member of the British military delegation to the United States, said that it is better to make Germany yield by intensifying air strikes and blockades than opening a second front. Lord Halifax, a close relative of the British King, and Mr. Asquith also share this view. Lieutenant Colonel Walter, Churchill's private secretary in Parliament, said that the Allied ship losses are more serious than British newspapers admit. The Swedish correspondent believes that, from all aspects, it seems impossible to open a second front this year.

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to news from London, General Barnes, Director of the US Army Department and Deputy Director of the Fire Bureau, has arrived in London and will negotiate with British officials on the adjustment of British and American military production. Many technical personnel have also arrived in England to assist in the negotiations.

### The United States and British Territories Conclude Rubber Agreement

Gusben, 13th, Central News Agency: According to a recent telegram from Washington, the US government has announced that it has concluded rubber agreements with the British territories of Trinidad and Guyana. The United States is allowed to purchase all of the rubber produced in the above two places. It is also learned that rubber agreements will soon be concluded with various small countries in Central America. However, the rubber production of various countries in Central America is very small. According to Trinidad and Guyana, the rubber production of these two places is extremely small. The production of the above two places is not seen in any rubber statistics or export trade statistics. However, Guyana only had 168 acres of rubber plantations in 1938. Therefore, the United States' signing of this agreement is just an empty promise.

### The History of the Caucasus (III)

Rather than saying that Bakiyevich was an outstanding soldier, he was more of a great organizer and clever diplomat. It is said that when he was at war with Turkey and good news was constantly being reported, the various northern tribes were quite peaceful. Regardless of the facts, in fact, several years after Bakiyevich returned to Russia in 1829, the fiery hope and faith contained in the Muridism religious movement gradually occupied power underground, and when it actually broke out, it was like a bolt from the blue for Russia! Tsar Nicholas I was a more insightful figure than his subordinates. He was extremely troubled by the seriousness of the situation. In 1837, he tried to personally meet with Shamir, the most difficult to tame Islamic monarch who was the leader of the rebellion. Unfortunately, this meeting never became a reality; when the special envoy sent by the king to contact Shamir about the meeting, the incident changed, and after that Shamir never trusted the Russians, and he was forced to surrender until 22 years later.

For most of this last period, Duke Vorontsov, who had already made a name for himself in the Crimean War, served as the Russian commander-in-chief. After the fruitless campaigns of 1845 to 48, this intelligent and capable general concentrated on internal reforms, in which he was very successful. Until 1856, he and Shamir both took a defensive stance in order to find an opportunity to attack. Vorontsov soon learned the difficulties of mountain warfare and the danger of fighting in a situation that was favorable to the enemy. A vivid description of this situation can be found in the book "The Conquest of the Caucasus" by the Englishman Baddeley. The following is an anecdote from the campaign of 1815:

"At about nine o'clock, the entire army had reached the edge of the forest. Here the commanding officer ordered a few hours' rest so that the soldiers could rest and eat to prepare for the attack. The view to the north was quite attractive to the Russians. Under their feet lay the hostile Chechnya, with undulating mountains stretching for dozens of miles, dotted with dense forests and gloomy valleys.... In the azure distance, a shadow on the horizon was Russia, to which many people took a last look. The route to Dargo stretched over the steep and wooded ridge tops, with no wide open spaces, and some places were only a few feet wide. The entire route formed an extremely long slope, with occasional sudden rises in the road surface. Every four or five hundred yards, the huge tree trunks entwined by the school prevented progress, and countless enemy troops were ambushed in the dense valleys on both sides..."

Duke Vorontsov left the Caucasus before Shamir's final surrender was realized. Since Shamir's surrender, Russia was able to officially establish control from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. Until this time, both sides had engaged in countless cruel acts, and the sparsely populated villages and mountain farms had also been ravaged, but the basic unity finally replaced the anarchy of ancient traditions, and the Caucasus was able to enjoy a higher and more organized prosperous culture.

It was not until the First Russian Revolution began to shake the entire structure of the Russian Empire that the chaos in the Caucasus revived and the situation became serious. In the events of 1902 to 05, in addition to the traditional animosity of the Caucasians against the Russians, the new movement of the Caucasian people expressing sympathy for the Russian people's resistance to their equally oppressed bureaucratic class and landlord class was beginning to unfold. People with insight among the Russians knew that the Georgian farmers were dissatisfied with sufficient reasons, and the last melancholy report of the Russian Governor-General of the Caucasus, Xu Geof, had thoroughly analyzed this situation.

However, the Russian side never attempted to improve the situation. It is regrettable that the Tsarist government could have skillfully dealt with this situation and adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards Georgia's cultural demands, so that the Christian connection between Georgia and Russia in the past may have been carried forward. On the contrary, the movement to separate from Russia and the Proletarian movement unfolded in parallel, and when the revolution broke out in 1917, Transcaucasia fell into extreme chaos. It was first occupied by the German army, and then by the Allied forces. The purpose of both sides was to prevent the oil wells from falling into the hands of the enemy.

It was not until 1921 that the Red Army, aided by the Bolsheviks' riots in various places, was able to bring Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan under its control, making them a part of the entire Soviet Union. A serious riot broke out in 1924; but since then, the wise policies implemented by the Soviet Union have completely changed the situation. A considerable degree of cultural autonomy, close attention to social reforms, the establishment of state-owned farms, and the opening of new schools, hospitals, and nursing homes have undoubtedly reduced the flames of those who advocate separation from Russia to nothing. In short, today, the people of the Caucasus deeply feel that their relationship with the Russians is on a more equal and more solid foundation than in the past (End)

Lisbon, 13th (Hai Tong News Agency dispatch) – New York dispatch: According to the American "Newsweek," Britain has made necessary arrangements in Egypt to prevent large quantities of cotton there from falling into Axis hands. This confirms that Britain has decided to adopt a "scorched earth" policy in Egypt. Regarding a plan to destroy the Suez Canal, the "New York Newsletter" commented that Britain has devised a novel method to block navigation of the canal. Since the Suez Canal has no locks, they propose blowing up the sandbanks, causing sand to fall into the river, and sinking several large ships at the same time. This would prevent the Axis powers from using the canal for a time. The newspaper believes this measure is not ideal, and the Axis powers may still be able to quickly restore the canal to operation.

### One Lane on Rue Albert Enforces Epidemic Lockdown, Lockdown on Rue Comte Lifted, Over 1800 Cholera Cases in Shanghai

According to the English "Shanghai Times," in order to thoroughly eliminate the spread of cholera, the French Concession's health bureau and police force placed an epidemic lockdown on Lane 56 of Rue Albert again on Tuesday, due to four cholera cases occurring in a residence in that lane. This is the second epidemic lockdown implemented by the French authorities this week, the first being implemented five days earlier on a lane on Rue Comte.

Residents of the Lane Strictly Prohibited from Entering and Exiting

It is reported that the lockdown on Rue Comte was lifted yesterday morning. The lockdown on Rue Albert is expected to last for more than three days. After receiving a report of four unconfirmed cholera cases in a house in Lane 569 of Rue Albert, the French Health Department immediately imposed a lockdown on the lane, strictly prohibiting residents from entering and exiting. However, from yesterday onwards, due to residents' requests to go out to work and buy groceries, they were allowed to enter and exit, provided they had vaccination certificates and guarantor residents.

All Houses Are Disinfected

At the same time, all houses in the lane were disinfected, and every resident was vaccinated. It is said that epidemic lockdowns in the International Settlement are not as extensive as those mentioned above. In the French Concession, the discovery of a cholera case immediately attracts the special attention of the health department, and notices are posted on each door to subject it to quarantine and inform it of various epidemic prevention methods. It is also reported that medical students from Aurora University in the French Concession have been invited to join the health department to administer vaccinations. The number of people vaccinated daily is over 30,000. Yesterday, a total of 32,040 people were vaccinated, bringing the total to 1,098,478.

Strict Vaccination Reduces Epidemic Cases

Yesterday, 36,787 people were vaccinated in the International Settlement, so the total number of people vaccinated in the two settlements yesterday was 68,827. The total number in the International Settlement is estimated to be 1,750,000. In the past few days, the discovery of cholera cases has shown a significant decline, decreasing by two to eight cases per day compared to the previous month. As of Tuesday, the total number of cholera cases discovered was 261 in the Chinese area, 358 in the French Concession, and 336 in the International Settlement. The number of deaths was 224 in the Chinese area, 49 in the French Concession, and 65 in the International Settlement.

### Yesterday's Shanghai Battle Commemoration

Yesterday was the "August 13th Shanghai Battle Commemoration Day." The city's police authorities were on high alert beforehand. The border areas of the two settlements first blocked unnecessary roads and dispatched armed detectives to guard important thoroughfares, strictly inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. Starting yesterday morning, the French Concession also dispatched a large number of mobile patrols, placing barbed wire everywhere and dividing them into entrances and exits to inspect vehicles and pedestrians. Even vehicles passing through each road were thoroughly checked. Therefore, the security throughout yesterday was unusually solid.

### French Concession Extends Re-issuance of Curfew Passes to End of Month

During the lighting control preparation period, all advertising signs, neon lights, and decorative lights in the city were extinguished. All districts in the city implemented the regulations at 7 p.m. on that day, and all neon lights and decorative advertising lights installed by shops on various roads were extinguished in compliance, with satisfactory results. Even the decorative lights in entertainment venues on various bustling roads, which usually shone as brightly as daytime, were also extinguished in a timely manner, no longer like before.

### Borax Warehouse Receipt Still Not Released, Jiang Yichi Suspected of Obtaining Money by Fraud

At that time, Jiang issued a receipt, instructing Wang to exchange it for a warehouse receipt from a certain bank. However, the warehouse receipt for this batch of goods has not been exchanged to this day, and the market price has been rising steadily to 45,000 new currency. Repeated negotiations to release the goods or return the price have been ineffective. Therefore, Wang was forced to sue Jiang Yichi for fraud to the Central Police Station. The Chinese detective Yan Kang arrested Jiang the day before yesterday, detained him, and waited for the investigation of the case before proceeding.

### Subletter Abuses Tenant, Citizen Certificate Refused Stamping, Rice Purchase Certificate Not Issued

Shen Quanlin, a local from the rice shop at No. 156 Hanbury Road, Hongkou, rented three rooms on the front floor to He Anlin, a Ningbo native, for a monthly rent of 28 yuan. After the implementation of the new currency, the rent was paid in full, but the rent was not halved, causing mutual friction. The subletter, Shen Quanlin, then asked him to move out, claiming to take it back for his own use. He then refused to stamp the citizen certificate application and did not issue the monthly rice certificate for the rationed grain. He also turned off the electricity and water, using various forms of oppression to force the three tenants and fishmonger He Anlin to submit. The case was reported to the Hongkou Police Station and the Fifth District Office of the Baojia system, causing the police to send detectives to arrest the subletter Shen Quanlin and take him to the police station. Later, a certain gentleman from the Fifth District Office mediated and bailed him out. Shen then filed a lawsuit against He Anlin with the criminal court, stating that the police detectives handcuffed his couple and detained them, etc. The case was heard yesterday morning, and He hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan to file a counterclaim for false accusation, stating the facts of the case. The court ordered each party to submit a guarantee of 2,000 yuan and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.

### New Developments in Evacuation Work, Sending Relief to Impoverished Citizens, Applications Start Today for One Month, Financial Assistance Provided After Investigating and Confirming Poverty

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War last year, the evacuation of the city's surplus population has long been recognized as a matter of urgency. Later, the Shanghai Municipal Council passed a military resolution to formally establish the Chinese Evacuation Committee, and the evacuation work reached a stage of rapid development.

Significance of Evacuation

Shanghai is an international city and also a commercial and industrial city. Because it is international, it has attracted a large number of refugees from neighboring suburbs. Because it is a commercial and industrial city, it accommodates a large number of workers and merchants. However, the sudden outbreak of the Pacific War cut off the source of raw materials and eliminated all exports of goods. The city's food problem also began to pose a deeper and more serious threat, causing this group of unemployed workers and merchants to return to their hometowns to find new livelihoods, and allowing this group of refugees from the neighboring suburbs who sought refuge in the city to return to their hometowns. For those who return to their hometowns, they can escape the threat of rice and the vortex of high prices. For the city as a whole, it is a necessary measure to maintain the city's security and prosperity.

Several Reforms

At the beginning of its establishment in February of this year, the committee obtained the cooperation of the Central China Railway Company and the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd., providing all returning Chinese with a 50% discount to enable the evacuation work to achieve a more satisfactory result. By the end of April, the committee had issued half-price return tickets to 50,565 people. Since May 1, due to the excessive losses of the two companies, the evacuation work continued as usual, but the half-price discount was temporarily suspended. However, from May 1 to the end of June, due to the change of the currency system, the rampant speculation, and the soaring prices, it was even more alarming. A total of 18,674 people came to the committee to request return tickets, and the number of people requesting travel expense assistance was even greater. At present, the price surge is difficult to suppress, and the impoverished citizens who cannot afford the high cost of living are everywhere. The return tickets issued by the committee daily exceed thousands of Zhang, and inquiries about preferential measures are constantly coming in. The committee believes that the half-price program has long been suspended. In addition to providing as much convenience as possible to those who request the issuance of return tickets, it is unable to assist those who request assistance or preferential treatment. However, in view of the current hardship of impoverished citizens and the high cost of travel expenses, the number of citizens who want to return to their hometowns but lack travel expenses is indeed very large. Therefore, the committee has consulted with all parties to find a proper solution to help impoverished citizens. Recently, with the cooperation of the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee, it was decided to jointly handle relief for impoverished citizens in the city. This is indeed great news for citizens who lack travel expenses and want to return to their hometowns.

Improved Methods

This time’s assistance differs greatly in nature from the half-price preferential treatment previously offered by the committee. The purpose of the previous half-price travel assistance was purely to provide preferential treatment to Shanghai residents returning to their hometowns. Therefore, all citizens residing in Shanghai who genuinely wished to return to their original hometowns without returning to Shanghai could apply to the committee for preferential treatment. However, the purpose of this relief is only to help impoverished citizens who want to leave Shanghai but lack travel expenses. Therefore, the target is only impoverished citizens who genuinely want to return to their hometowns. Due to the different nature of this relief and the previous half-price preferential treatment, the application procedures are also slightly different in order to ensure that genuinely impoverished citizens can benefit universally and that opportunistic citizens cannot use their tricks.

Application Procedures

This time, the committee is jointly conducting relief with the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee. The committee is responsible for handling the application investigation and approval matters, and the Relief Committee is responsible for issuing the funds. Impoverished citizens in the city who genuinely wish to return to their original hometowns can go to the committee at No. 277, Fuzhou Road, Shanghai Municipal Council Building, to obtain an application form. After the application form is filled out, it must be guaranteed by the head of the household, the head of the neighborhood, or various charitable organizations that it is indeed impoverished and wants to return to their hometown. Then it must be sent to the committee. After the committee verifies that it is true, it can then go to the committee to obtain a return ticket and a relief ticket. Then, based on the relief ticket, it can go to the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee to collect the amount that has been approved by the committee. Although the procedures are slightly cumbersome, they can eliminate fraud.

Financial Assistance

Regarding the amount of relief funds and the number of people who should receive them, according to the principles formulated by the committee and the relief committee, it is to subsidize three-tenths of the total travel expenses. However, if three-tenths of the total travel expenses exceeds 15 yuan, 25 yuan will be subsidized. The travel expenses may be based on train fares or on boat fares, and the amounts vary. In order to make the handling simple and quick, the committee has formulated various standards. Those going to major cities or nearby small cities and towns will be given relief fees according to the standards listed. For those with long distances, 25 yuan will be given uniformly. If there is any false reporting of the destination, once the committee verifies that it is true, in addition to canceling the funds that should be obtained, the guarantor will also be held liable.

Assistance from All Sectors

Since the population of Shanghai has been evacuated, as of now, the committee has issued hometown certificates to approximately 100,000 people. Combining the number of hometown certificates issued by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the number can be even more visible. However, due to the excessive population of Shanghai, it still has little impact on the current population of the city. Judging from the rampant cholera in Shanghai and the persistent high prices, the importance of evacuation work is still increasing. The committee's responsibilities lie in doing its best to work for evacuation. We hope that all sectors of the city can deeply understand the evacuation work, benefit both the evacuees themselves and the residents of Shanghai, and give it great cooperation. The committee is still entrusting various native-place associations and national entities to issue return tickets, such as China Travel Service, World Travel Service, Ningbo Native Place Association, and Shaoxing Native Place Association, all of which can issue them on its behalf, and the procedures are extremely simple.

Only Opportunity

This relief will be held from the 13th of this month for one month. We hope that impoverished citizens will not lose such a good opportunity to return to their hometowns. All charitable organizations and major groups are also welcome to send impoverished citizens to the committee for application, but it is necessary to pay close attention to whether they are impoverished and whether they are indeed returning to their hometowns so that genuinely impoverished citizens can have one more opportunity. New wells and existing water wells should be opened and preserved. The above-mentioned natural water conservancy and water wells, if appropriate, may be used to replace items (a) and (d). Fire-fighting equipment. A. Each household shall prepare a water bucket with a capacity of eight liters (circular). B. The family air defense team must store a two-person lightweight pump with a water capacity of more than 70 liters per minute, and must be equipped with two or more water pipes that are ten meters long. C. At locations where flammable or ignitable materials such as oils and medicines are stored, foam fire extinguishers and carbon tetrachloride fire extinguishers should be prepared. Other. A. Each household should prepare about 50 liters of yellow sand or soil. B. Each household should prepare straw mats and water ladles. C. Clothing, socks, hats, etc. that are easy to operate should be prepared for use during fire-fighting work. D. The family air defense team should prepare nets, iron bars (about two meters long), and lightweight ladders. E. The family air defense team should set up a passage or emergency exit within the boundaries of each household to facilitate mutual cooperation in fire prevention. (To be continued)

### Notice from the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters: Essential Guidelines for Family Air Defense and Firefighting

The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters of this city recently issued Notice No. 2, stipulating the essential guidelines for family air defense and firefighting guidance as follows:

Monthly

First General Rules, Second Fire Prevention Equipment and Tools for Families and Family Air Defense Teams: Small Fire Prevention Equipment, Fire Fighting Tools, Others. Third Fire Fighting and Other Defense Measures for Families and Family Air Defense Teams: Preparations in Peacetime, Actions to Take When Air Defense Orders are Issued, Actions to Take When Alert Warnings are Issued, Actions to Take When Air Raid Sirens are Sounded, Firefighting Work, A. The Limits of the Family Air Defense Team's Mission, B. Defense Against Fires Caused by Incendiary Bombs, C. Defense Against Fires Caused by Other Reasons, D. Defense When Fires Break Out, E. Essential Guidelines for Fire Fighting Work, F. Essential Guidelines for Protection and Surveillance, Other Defense Activities, Actions to Take After Air Raid Sirens are Canceled.

Main Text

First General Rules: Fires occurring during air raids often have multiple unique characteristics. They must be detected immediately, and appropriate fire prevention measures must be taken to prevent them from spreading. Uphold the belief that "every member of the family protects the home," while cultivating a spirit of mutual assistance among neighbors. Without waiting for the fire brigade to come to the rescue, families and family air defense teams should use their strength, calmly, bravely, and alertly, to engage in fire prevention to achieve thorough self-defense and fire prevention. When a fire breaks out, the family air defense team can take appropriate action and often achieve the purpose of extinguishing the fire.

All types of bombs, especially incendiary bombs, should be fully understood in terms of their performance. Based on the actual situation, and with the understanding of learning effective and appropriate fire prevention methods, the method of agile and emergency fire prevention should be used to solidify confidence in fire prevention. When attacked by incendiary bombs, there may also be attacks with poison gas. However, all measures must be taken to continue firefighting work, always focusing on defending against fire.

Because of its low prices and high-quality goods, business is very prosperous.

### A Look at Song and Dance Venues, Then and Now

It is said that in Shanghai, for any business, gimmicks are everything. With gimmicks, one need not worry about food and clothing, and can even become famous and wealthy. Gimmicks are related to talent, and those of mediocre talent lack flexible minds, but become very jealous when they see others getting rich. Therefore, every time a gimmick is invented, a large number of people follow suit en masse. On a large scale, there was the previous rush on trust and trading firms; on a small scale, chicken congee and vegetable rice were also once extremely popular. Since the war, there have been two trends that have been particularly strong, almost dizzying. The first was the cotton yarn and silver rush, which rose and fell quickly, followed by the sprouting of insurance stocks and enterprises like bamboo shoots after the rain. Two months ago, someone suddenly chose a corner of the third floor of the New World, opened the Gao Le Song and Dance Venue, and launched a large-scale advertising campaign, touting it as a brand-new style and an ideal paradise. In short, the wording was so effective that it resonated deeply in people's hearts. Not going to visit would be a regret in life. Shanghainese are used to falling for this kind of trick. Sure enough, after the opening, business was booming. In less than a month, the original capital of 100,000 yuan was doubled in profit. As a result, merchants who were holding surplus funds and struggling to find a business to invest in rushed to imitate. Those that have already opened include Gao Le, Jue Lu, Zhang Garden, Heavenly Palace, and Jinmen. The original two Xiao Guang Han venues, fearing being left behind, quickly redecorated. Four others are speeding up preparations and are scheduled to open soon: Da Hua: Tong Yu Chun Restaurant upstairs on Nanjing Road. Da Xin: The original ballroom on the sixth floor of the Da Xin Company on Yu Qiaqing Road. Chang Le: Chang Le Tea House on Si Ma Road. Jin Long Western Restaurant on the third floor is also being converted into a song and dance venue, the name of which has not yet been determined. In addition, it is unknown how many others have sufficient capital but have not yet found a suitable location. Truly, what a grand sight!

Looking back at the history of song and dance venues in Shanghai, it can be said that they have always existed, but they are more prevalent now. I do not know about the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, but around the tenth year of the Republic of China, Huang Chu Jiu ran the Great World, which was quite ambitious. In addition to incorporating all kinds of northern and southern variety shows, there were also two large venues, which caused quite a stir. One was the Qian Kun Theater, a major Peking opera troupe, and the other was the Gong He Hall, which invited famous courtesans from the northern district. There were many talented people. Roughly speaking, this should be the beginning of song and dance venues in Shanghai. Six or seven years later, after the Qing Lian Ge new building was completed on Si Ma Road, someone took advantage of the evening downtime at the location to open the Xiao Guang Han Song and Dance Venue on the third floor. The layout was roughly the same as the Gong He Hall, but the practice of requesting songs had already begun. The ticket price was 2 jiao per small silver coin, and each song request cost 1 yuan. Memorable performers included Xiang Rong, Wu Cuifen, Jiu Ling, Mei Hua, Xiao Xiao Ling Long, Hong Di, and Cao Huifen, who were known for their beauty or their talent. The lineup could not be considered weak. In addition, the ticket prices were low, so it was not long before a daytime session was added, with even cheaper tickets, only 1 jiao per small silver coin. As mentioned above, Shanghainese like to follow suit en masse. Someone saw that Xiao Guang Han was making a profit and quickly followed suit. Soon, Chang Le opened diagonally opposite Xiao Guang Han, and Shi Dai opened on San Ma Road. Within a hundred steps, three venues stood side by side. Needless to say, competition was fierce. At first, there were only small events such as telephone reservations and perfume handkerchiefs. Then, to gain an advantage, Xiao Guang Han added an extra section after the Qing singing, hiring northerners Ya Yun Ji, Fang Renmi, Wang Mazi, and Zhang Hama to perform comedy. Ya Yun Ji had a signature performance called "Da Bu Gang," which was extremely popular with the audience. The other two venues naturally refused to be outdone and quickly copied the format. After maintaining this for a year or two, Xiao Guang Han came up with another unique idea. At the time, Zhang Henshui's novel "A Tale of Laughter and Tears" was all the rage. Zhang Shichuan and Gu Wuwei fought all the way to the Executive Yuan to win the film production rights. Just as this situation was difficult to resolve and attracting widespread attention, Xiao Guang Han's boss suddenly launched a surprise attack and adapted it into Peking opera, performed by Qing singing girls. Regardless of the performance's success, this gimmick was certainly novel. The venue was packed day and night for a month, and the boss was undoubtedly complacent as the money rolled in.

Only at this point did Shi Dai and Chang Le realize that copying old tricks was not a good strategy and that the key to success was to try something new. So they simply made a fundamental change, hiring a group of female performers to perform Peking opera as the main act, supplemented by Qing singing. Before long, Xiao Guang Han turned around and joined the competition. This was after 1936.

When Xiao Guang Han, Shi Dai, and Chang Le all switched to performing modern-style Peking opera, the competition became even fiercer. Recruiting talent was the top priority, followed by advertising, and no one was willing to be outdone. Xiao Guang Han had mainstays such as Xiao Wang Huchen, Zhou Biyun, Jiang Xiaolou, Su Cuixia, and Liu Qinxin. Shi Dai had mainstays such as Zhang Wenjuan and Jiang Yunxia, and Zhou Meiyan, while Chang Le had mainstays such as Le Di, Qiu Yunyan, and Zhou Meijuan. On the advertising front, they were afraid of being outdone, giving away free tickets and treating people to meals. Some of the female performers, hoping that the audience would praise and support them more, did not hesitate to treat them like fathers. How could they not do their best as adopted daughters? So they sent flower baskets, embroidered curtains, and formed poetry clubs. The scene was no less grand than a group of old and famous scholars wildly supporting the four great Dan actresses.

Unfortunately, good times do not last. Some of the female performers were scouted one by one, and while they were still popular, Zhou Biyun, Qiu Yunyan, and others married and retired. Liu Qinxin, Jiang Yunxia, and others went to other ports to join other troupes. "It is easy to gather a thousand soldiers, but hard to find a general." Once the mainstays were gone, the situation became dismal. Two years ago, Shi Dai was the first to close, followed by Chang Le, which switched to Yue opera. Xiao Guang Han, which had always been known for its gimmicks, was also on its last breath.

Over the past 20 years, song and dance venues have undergone three transformations. The first transformation was from purely Qing singing to allowing guests to request songs. The second transformation was from allowing guests to request songs to incorporating performances. It is unknown whether the newly emerging song and dance venues will increase the number of performances in the future. Currently, they are all mainly based on requesting songs. The difference from the past is that after being requested to sing, the female performer has the obligation to sit with the guest. This is the third transformation.

For female performers, being requested to sing at a song and dance venue is seen as an opportunity to show off. For those requesting songs, it is either to show support or for other purposes. At Xiao Guang Han and Sheng Shi Dai, requesting a song cost 1 yuan, the same price as now. However, most patrons would only request one song. In recent times, the trend has gradually become extremely extravagant, with some requesting as many as half a dozen or a dozen. In 1935, a certain general, appearing in Shanghai in a grand style, occasionally visited Xiao Guang Han. After being encouraged by friends, he requested 10 dozens for Xiao Xiao Ling Long. At the time, this was seen as an unprecedentedly extravagant act. Today, it is considered the bare minimum. On the third day of Gao Le's opening, the reporter and a friend went along. Halfway up the stairs, they encountered a female performer, Miss XX, who was known for her straightforwardness and immediately said, "Hey! Xiao Pan, the yellow-headed [foreigner] isn't giving me any money. Help me out!" Because they were old acquaintances, it was natural to be obligated. Okay, how about five dozens? He figured that five dozens would be 60 yuan, which the reporter already considered quite luxurious. Who knew that after entering the venue, he kept hearing the staff reporting that Mr. So-and-so requested 100 dozens for Miss So-and-so, or 200 dozens for someone else, and that 50 dozens and 30 dozens were no longer eye-catching. The reporter was ashamed and embarrassed by his poverty. What a difference a year makes! Who knew things would get so much worse!

According to those familiar with the business: song and dance venues at this time are indeed quite profitable. The average capital invested is around 100,000 to 250,000 yuan. The tea charge of 3 yuan is enough to cover most of the expenses. The revenue from song requests is pure profit. They distribute it as follows: 12 yuan per dozen song requests, 6 yuan goes to the female performer, 3 yuan to the owner, 2 yuan to the band, and 1 yuan to the tea servers and miscellaneous workers. Taking a total of 2,000 dozens of song requests per day and night sessions as the standard, the owner can earn 6,000 yuan per day, or 180,000 yuan per month. Even if you take a 50% cut, you can still recover the capital in two to three months.

Some people doubt whether this prosperity can last. On this point, the reporter has the following observations: the income from song requests cannot be relied upon too much. Shanghainese are very astute when it comes to spending money. Those who desperately request songs for a while are likely to have ulterior motives. After a certain amount of time, they will definitely realize that this kind of repayment method is too uneconomical (the patron pays 1 yuan, but the female performer only gets 5 jiao). This is the same principle as buying tickets and sitting in a dance hall. The decline of dance halls from their peak can serve as a warning to song and dance venues. Therefore, song and dance venues that do not want to establish an unbeatable foundation should do so. If they want to establish an unbeatable foundation, they should still rely on Qing singing and equipment to attract customers. Frankly speaking, although the new song and dance venues have no shortage of outstanding women, the general lineup is still weak. Therefore, in the reporter's opinion, the most urgent task for song and dance venue authorities in the future is to find or train female performers. As for equipment and hospitality, they are obviously far superior to the past, which is a kind of progress that cannot be denied. (Qin Meng)

It was decided to grant a special extension of the application deadline, from today until the 20th of this month. Applicants can continue to obtain application forms from the newspaper and fill them out according to the procedures. However, it should be especially noted that this application must be accompanied by a written certificate from the university authorities, confirming that the applicant is of excellent character and academic standing, and comes from an impoverished family to qualify.

Continued Application for Free Academic Quotas

The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Movement has received enthusiastic support from various middle and primary schools, tutoring schools, etc., with many donating free academic quotas.

### Ample Stock of Edible Oil: Over 5,000 Barrels of New Dalian Oil Arrive

Under the coordination of the city's Edible Oil Office, the stock of edible oil in the city is quite ample. 5,555 barrels of new Dalian soybean oil have arrived, and the next batch is still under negotiation. The production of the factory has also increased considerably, so the supply should not be a problem. The recent reduction in retail volume is purely due to delays in the moving permit.

### Grain Transactions Becoming Increasingly Scarce

Grain transactions were increasingly scarce yesterday during the security alert period. The market was extremely quiet. Only 20 bags of Qingcan from Minhang were traded, priced at 143 yuan, with the buyer responsible for the bag. There were also 200 bags of Sanxin small-package bran from May, priced at 99.5 yuan, with a firm base.

### Decorative Gold Unmoved

Yesterday, the price of gold jewelry at the Tianxin Gold Shop and other shops in the city remained at 2,200 yuan per tael, with a reduction of 350 yuan for purchases. The retail price at cash shops was also unchanged, at 2,200 yuan, with 2,000 yuan for purchases. No transactions were heard among shops, priced at around 1,924 yuan, a difference of 10 yuan.

### New Watermelon Seeds: Price Negotiation Still Difficult

According to the express news from Xuzhou, Guzhen and other places yesterday, new watermelon seeds have already been launched on the market, but the output is not strong, and the initial weather was too dry, followed by heavy rain, so the harvest will be reduced. Therefore, the production price is still high. Large watermelon seeds are priced at over 500 yuan, and small seeds also require a strong 400 yuan, so the various firms here have no intention of purchasing. Those who have made slight purchases are also just testing the new product.

### Eastern Goods and Shrimp Tails: Arrivals Are Scarce

The arrival of eastern goods shrimp tails has been lacking recently, and the stock in the market is also scarce. At the same time, sales are not high due to the relatively high prices. Yesterday, the market price for Yuandong tails was 2,300 yuan, and Chao Bian was 1,900 yuan. The trend is stable.

### Autumn

— Si Nai

Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has gradually turned cooler, and everyone seems to be taking a breath, but we cannot ignore the "autumn tiger."

The autumn tiger may be even more fierce than summer. The daytime is hot, and the night is cool, with uneven temperature changes, making it easy to get sick.

Sometimes there is another gust of autumn wind and rain, and everyone suffers. Everyone is worried that a severe drought will occur, and once the crops are not harvested, even worse things will befall us. We cannot be afraid!

Some people still think it's the same as summer, muddling along, unwilling to do things, euphemistically saying that the weather is still hot, eating and drinking cold things in large quantities, and want to comfortably enjoy happiness, but they do not know that if they do not work hard in autumn, there will be no stored grain in winter. All kinds of cholera and epidemics are even more rampant in autumn. Continuing to be confused like this, they will definitely regret it later.

Autumn is bleak, take care of yourself!

### In the Midst of the Plague

— Feng Ma Niu

"Oh! The assistant at the steamed bun shop next door was lively and energetic just a few hours ago, and now he's gone. A sudden stomach ache, and he's dead. I wonder what bad thing he ate again?"

"Yeah, you really have to be careful what you eat these days. A friend's relative had a bowl of zha jiang noodles at a snack shop, and immediately died after returning home!"

"Even banquets are hard to enjoy. Who knows how long that meat and shrimp have been soaking in the refrigerator?"

In this narrow, crowded alley, it suddenly becomes lively in the evening. Although there isn't a cool breeze to be felt, it is still much more spacious than the lofts and kitchen sheds where we live. And people have a habit of seeking out crowds and busyness. Who wouldn't be happy to chat aimlessly with neighbors about anything and everything? So the alley is quite packed. These days, perhaps because of the city-wide epidemic, everyone's conversations inevitably turn to this issue.

Mrs. Qiao is also one of the participants in the conversation, but unlike others who treat the conversation as a passing breeze, she still has a heavy stone weighing on her heart. This stone is the tiger-like plague, and it seems to be pressing down on her three children, and her thin Mr. Qiao.

"If we catch the disease, it'll be terrible!" Mrs. Qiao worries. She says to herself, "Starting tomorrow, I have to thoroughly clean up everything, especially the food."

The next day, Mrs. Qiao's second child is already clamoring for his mother to buy him breakfast. But today, Mrs. Qiao puts on a stern face and says, "The fried dough sticks and sesame cakes at the street entrance are not clean. Starting today, you are not allowed to eat them anymore..." As usual, Mrs. Qiao's family doesn't light the stove in the morning to save coal briquettes, so they buy snacks to eat. And the snacks are usually sesame cakes and steamed buns. Now that the "order" forbids them to eat these, it's not just the children crying and fussing; even Mr. Qiao, who's in a hurry to get to the "office," wrinkles his brow: "What are we going to eat then? Cook porridge? Rice isn't cheap, and we still need side dishes. Eating at the tea house, two barbecued pork buns cost more than a dollar, and it's not enough to fill me up!" In the end, after much arguing, Mrs. Qiao finds it difficult to please everyone. Originally, if they don't eat sesame cakes, what else can they eat? She buys them first and then thinks of a solution. Mr. Qiao always walks to the "office" to save money, and he eats his meals at the office. This makes Mrs. Qiao worry again. First, walking in the hot sun is too much for her thin Mr. Qiao. Second, the boxed lunches that the employees eat are mostly unhygienic and lack nutrition. So she kindly advises Mr. Qiao, but Mr. Qiao tilts his back, which has been bent by life's hardships, and scorns his wife's "woman's opinions": "First of all, the prices for taking the tram or rickshaw are outrageous, ranging from half a dollar to three dollars. As for boxed lunches, if I don't eat them, what else am I going to eat? I need to fill my stomach now, so who cares about hygiene!"

Mrs. Qiao is splashed with cold water. Thinking that her husband won't listen to her advice, she decides to think of a solution for the children. So she says to Mr. Qiao, "Go to the main street and buy a pound of biscuits, so the children don't eat unclean snacks. And Mao Mao is really too thin, don't forget to bring him some cod liver oil pills."

Mr. Qiao doesn't answer, puts on his straw hat, and leaves.

The children are restless and complain about the heat, running around outside early in the morning. The alley is also very smelly, but the children prefer to play hide-and-seek on the garbage heap. This makes Mrs. Qiao shout at the top of her lungs: "Come inside, come inside! The alley is not clean!" But the two children outside don't come in, and Mao Mao, who is sleeping inside, suddenly starts crying loudly. Mrs. Qiao walks into the room with the "hot water heater," and Mao Mao points to his leg and cries, "Bug! Bug!" It turns out that Mao Mao's calf has been bitten by bedbugs, leaving a large red mark. The alley is noisy like a blacksmith's shop, and Mao Mao is like a hot iron, covered with heat rash, sores, and mosquito bites.

After settling Mao Mao, Mrs. Qiao goes to the market to buy groceries, and then busies herself with cutting, washing, and cooking. The kitchen is even hotter, and Mrs. Qiao feels dizzy and nauseous. She quickly drinks two bottles of "sha" medicine water.

At dusk, Mr. Qiao returns home. Mrs. Qiao stares at him and asks, "Where are the biscuits?" Mr. Qiao spreads his hands: "They're gone. They cost more than ten dollars a pound. I haven't received this month's salary yet, and I haven't even bought flour for this week!"

At this moment, the two older children are holding red, frozen cakes of some kind. Mrs. Qiao doesn't say anything. She thinks, "What hygiene and nutrition are we talking about for people like us!" The plague is like a large stone, but Mrs. Qiao feels that all she can do is "leave it to fate" if it falls!

### Self-Portrait

— Wen Kui

Within the "Greater Self" exists an insignificant seventeen-year-old "Lesser Self." He hails from Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province, born into a poor family, and possesses an inherent disdain for others due to his impoverished background. The name "Wen Kui" is utterly unsuitable for him, but to facilitate recognition and distinction, Mr. Wu bestowed it upon him during his elementary school days, and he readily adopted it as his own. Had no one named him, any numerical designation would have sufficed. He is innately fond of nonchalance and embodies a quintessential sanguine temperament. He would rather be beaten than scolded, refusing to yield under any circumstances, yet he himself delights in berating others. Exploiting minor advantages is his forte, evident in all his actions: he freely borrows from others without returning, while jealously guards his own possessions, offering flimsy excuses to avoid lending. However, when expounding upon his philosophy of life, he articulates the profound notion of "you can't bring it with you when you're born, and you can't take it with you when you die," conveniently adding that "what's yours is mine, but what's mine is mine, and you can't have it." He frequently denounces the snobbery of the wealthy, citing numerous relatives who once were poor but now are rich. Any assistance provided to the impoverished evokes his vehement condemnation: "These ungrateful wretches, whom I once elevated, now act as if they are superior, turning their backs on their benefactors. Their comeuppance will arrive one day, and then I shall have my revenge." Such Schadenfreude is a recurrent theme in his pronouncements. At times, he proclaims, "If I were rich, I would do this and that..." In reality, even if he possessed the entire world, he would likely become the epitome of snobbery. When a friend achieves success, whether through diligence or luck, his admiration morphs into envy, even contemplating malicious schemes to undermine them. As for himself, he fantasizes about success, believing it to be ordained by fate. Success, he believes, is inevitable with good fortune, so he sits at home all day, awaiting the arrival of his lucky break, doing nothing but eating three meals a day. The downfall of a friend elicits his great joy. On the surface, he advises them on how to improve, but in his heart, he wonders why they don't become beggars. He is aware of his numerous shortcomings, and devises various plans for improvement, yet never puts them into practice. Even when he does attempt change, he unwittingly relapses into his old habits, all the while presenting himself as a remarkable individual to others.

In every corner of the world, especially in urban areas, there are many like him. But is he inherently this way? No, absolutely not! He has been molded. When there are no such individuals as him in the world, that will be a time of universal peace.

### To Fellow Students Receiving Aid

— Yu

University, junior high school, primary school, vocational, and supplementary school students who applied for financial aid have undergone screening examinations, interviews, and other review procedures. Approvals have now been granted and are being announced sequentially. Those students receiving financial aid are able to continue their studies thanks to donations from various sectors, thus providing a temporary respite from economic hardship. However, we believe that in addition to the economic assistance urgently needed by students, spiritual cultivation and academic exchange are also fundamental issues for their education. Resolving the difficulties of enrollment provides an opportunity for education. Achieving academic success is of course the students' own responsibility, and also the expectation of the donors.

Here, based on a spirit of earnestness, we would like to discuss a few points regarding the attitude toward learning with the students receiving aid.

Zuo Zongtang said, "One only has a few years to truly focus on studying. Before sixteen, knowledge has not yet dawned; after twenty-five or twenty-six, worldly affairs become increasingly complex. If these few years are wasted, then nothing will be accomplished." These are a few words that are quite worthy of our attention. We must cherish time and concentrate our minds. How can we relax even the slightest bit the opportunity to study that we have obtained with such difficulty? Even if we have the means to study in the future, we will never again have the opportunity to study hard at the appropriate age. This is the first point.

Zeng Guofan said, "Diligence in study is like digging a well. Rather than digging many wells and never reaching the spring, why not focus on one well, striving to reach the spring, and then using it inexhaustibly? In terms of the ordinary subjects at school, these are common knowledge that everyone should have. Of course, we are not hoping that students will specialize in only one subject. However, considering the industry and commerce employees, there are many students who request to study several subjects. Their courage to learn is commendable, but in order to be practical and to achieve learning outcomes, we feel that it is easier to obtain results by specializing in one subject in stages. This is the second point.

Zhu Xi said, "Studying is like cooking meat; you must first cook with a strong fire, and then simmer with a slow fire." This is the experience of one's own rigorous management. The Family Instructions of Liu Bin also state, "Self-cultivation must be earnest, and learning must be firm." Since ancient times, those who have achieved academic success have all come from hard work and diligent study. This is the third point.

Of course, the sages of the past have left many good words regarding the way of learning, which can serve as models for the students. Today, we only present a few fragments, or things that students may have heard before. We hope that students will deeply inscribe the words "today's scholars are for others," cultivate themselves quietly in this learning process, and abandon bad habits. Learning is for seeking knowledge, and seeking knowledge is for application. The students receiving aid today will surely be the capable materials of society in the future. This is our wish.

### Sharing a Boat in the Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What to Do

This was truly astonishing. Mrs. Ye Er, fearing her hearing wasn't sharp enough, opened her mouth and asked, "What did you say?" Even after asking, she kept her mouth open, waiting for He Zixing's reply. He Zixing said, "Neither the young master nor A Xing are at the Chen's house." He Zixing had already repeated himself to make it clear that what he told Mrs. Ye Er the first time was no different from the second time. Cui Zhen also became anxious and said, "He Zixing, you must have gone to the wrong house. Maybe there are many families named Chen in Shuangqiao Town. The one you asked about isn't the one the young master went to. This Chen family has a large elm tree in front of their door; not far from the Chen family is a house with black walls; their house is old-fashioned and not very tall; their grandmother likes to chant scriptures and is very old. Is this the family you asked about?" He Zixing said, "How could it not be? Yes, I may not be able to read, but I know these things. Second Madam, it's cold outside, let's talk inside."

Mrs. Ye Er moved inside. In the dim twilight, He Zixing took off his straw sandals in the courtyard, walked barefoot into the wing room, and said, "The Chen family is in Shuangqiao Town, with a big tree in front of the door. I didn't notice if it was an elm tree, but I didn't make any mistake. The old lady of the Chen family said to me, 'Our young master left our house yesterday after eating, and A Xing also ate at our house.'" Mrs. Ye Er and Cui Zhen said in unison, "He Zixing, why are you talking like this? One moment you say the young master isn't at the Chen's house, and the next moment you say the young master ate at the Chen's house?" He Zixing said, "I didn't say anything wrong. The young master and A Xing ate at the Chen's house yesterday; today when I went to the Chen's house, neither the young master nor A Xing were there." Mrs. Ye Er and Cui Zhen both patted their chests to calm their nerves, and also felt somewhat relieved. They understood after hearing He Zixing continue: Wei Cheng and his servant had braved the thunder to go to the Chen family yesterday morning. Chen Guoqi wasn't even home, so Wei Cheng waited, then went directly to Shanghai from Shuangqiao, most likely to visit Chen Guoqi's siblings. (154)

### Busyness and Leisure

— Grape

In the previous issue of this journal, I read an article entitled "How to Utilize Free Time." It was a record of a lecture that encouraged young students to make good use of their free time during the summer vacation to "accumulate" knowledge in the areas of morality, intellect, physique, and aesthetics. The intention was excellent.

However, there are also things worth discussing, namely, the division of humanity into two types: busy people and idle people. The former includes teachers, students, company employees...; the latter includes vagrants and beggars, and the speaker hoped that the audience and readers would learn to be busy people.

I believe that what needs to be noted is that busy people are not necessarily "good people" or "builders of society." Although they bustle about all day long, most of them are still motivated by selfishness and self-interest; even if they occasionally achieve something and earn various respectable titles, what do they contribute to society?

As for vagrants and beggars, although they are disdained by the public, they are also an inevitable product of an unhealthy society. Calling them "idle people" seems inappropriate; "those who have money have leisure" is a very simple truth. Leaving aside the leisured class who indulge in extravagant pleasures, it is unfair to blame the beggars who are ostracized from the professional circles and struggle to survive.

Since the meaning of "busyness" and "leisure" has not been affirmed, the yardstick used to divide humanity is also unreliable.

However, "time is money," and it is the responsibility of every progressive person to make good use of every moment to contribute to the welfare of human society.

"Busyness" should mean working intensely.

And "leisure" should not be synonymous with passively waiting for death!

### The Philosophy of Wearing Old Clothes

— Ge Liang

Is there a philosophy to wearing old clothes? Yes! Of course there is!

If you wear an old gown and broken leather shoes and walk down the street, and you immediately feel shy, ashamed, or even blush when others look at your gown or shoes, then you lack the "philosophy of old clothes."

However, if you want to buy a new outfit, that's not bad either. But when you step into a cloth shop, you can't help but stick out your tongue at the prices, and you can't help but frown at the materials. Taking a step back, if you don't go to a tailor, then go ask your mother for a thread for the clothes on your wanderer body, but just the money for buying a needle and thread is enough for a new cloth jacket before.

The philosophy of wearing old clothes is this: if someone notices your broken leather shoes, that doesn't matter, you don't have to be embarrassed. If you wear the most fashionable, most beautiful, newest, most modern, most attractive new leather shoes on the street, you will of course attract the attention of others. What do you feel at that time? Probably nothing more than pleasant! Since this is the case, why should you be uneasy in the former case and high-spirited in the latter case, even though you are both being noticed by others! So you might as well raise your feet higher and show off your broken leather shoes, and let others appreciate them.

A true friend values knowing your heart, but if a friend only knows your clothes, and doesn't greet you because he sees your outfit isn't "valuable," that's fine, let him go. The passive way to deal with this is to be indifferent. Not talking to me saves me from reciting thirty-six famous polite greetings. The active way to deal with this is, he despises my clothes, I despise his snobbery. Humph, it is impolite not to reciprocate!

In this day and age, you don't need to envy or be jealous of others' new clothes, and you also don't need to be ashamed of your own worn clothes. As for feeling ashamed, you simply shouldn't. Because no matter if it's a dog or a cat, a pushcart driver or a rickshaw puller, once they get rich, they dress up so elegantly that poets and writers can't reach them, and scholars and literati retreat three houses, then, on the other hand, in this chaotic world, shouldn't we wear old gowns and broken leather shoes? Wouldn't that be too...too something, right?
