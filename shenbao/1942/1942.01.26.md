### Malayan War: Focus Still on West Coast; Japanese Advance in Burma Front; Fierce Battle Expected Near Mottama

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese vanguard in Malaya is advancing towards the British forces in central Johor, reaching within one mile southwest of the important railway junction of Kluang, about sixty miles north of Singapore. Kluang's capture is imminent, and the Kluang airfield is already ablaze. Japanese forces who captured Jemaps on Thursday occupied Yong Peng yesterday morning and have joined forces with the Japanese advancing south along the west coast.

Tokyo, 25th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports from the Burma front, after breaking through the British defenses at the strategic pass of Kawkareik, Japanese forces continue to advance and are now almost near Mottama. The British may offer strong resistance at Mottama, as its location at the mouth of the Salween River is advantageous for defensive warfare. It is reported that preparations are underway to evacuate civilians. Meanwhile, in the Malayan peninsula, although British forces launched a counter-offensive on the west coast at Senggarang, sixteen kilometers southeast of Batu Pahat, the Japanese are still making steady progress.

Stockholm, 25th (Haitong News Agency) – British military authorities in London reported that British forces in Burma have retreated towards Mottama. Japanese forces have broken through the Kawkareik Pass. Yesterday, aircraft bombed Yangon again. British forces in Malaya have retreated to south of the Muar River, and the central British forces have also retreated south of Segamat. After capturing Yong Peng, Japanese forces have engaged with British troops at Ayer Hitam. The breakouts of the Australian 8th Division have been unsuccessful. The soon-to-be-landed Japanese forces should be able to join up with the forces fighting on the west coast.

Singapore, 25th (Reuters) – The Malayan war remains most intense on the west coast. Japanese forces have again entered the British rear, and their food supplies are being replenished by air. British fighter planes in the central region have launched their first attacks on Japanese bombers. The Australian troops on the east coast, familiar with the terrain, had cleared the local residents several weeks ago to prevent Japanese forces from entering the rear.

Berlin, 25th (Reuters) – The German official news agency reported from Tokyo that Japanese forces have occupied Muar (seventy miles north of Singapore) on the east coast of Malaya.

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters reviewed the war situation, stating that Japanese forces in the Philippines are continuing to attack the US-Philippine troops on the Bataan Peninsula.

After capturing the steep terrain and forests of Mount Natip on the 14th, the main force of the Japanese army crossed the Mariveles River and occupied Abucay, driving the American forces south. The Japanese forces fighting in the Orani area advanced to the Morong district and, after a fierce battle on the 21st, broke through the strong defenses of the Mauban district and are continuing to advance south. At the same time, other Japanese forces on the island have entered Bagac on the west coast of Bataan, cutting off American communications. Regarding the situation in the Dutch East Indies, Japanese forces who landed on Tarakan Island have cleared out the remaining enemy forces and occupied several oilfields.

### Federal Army Minister Orders Mobilization of Australian Defense Forces; Curtin Proposes Establishment of Pacific Military Council, to be Organized by Representatives of Participating Nations

Melbourne, 25th (Reuters) –

Australian Federal Minister for the Army and Acting Prime Minister Forde has ordered the nation to be immediately placed on a war footing and to mobilize all defense forces for readiness.

Sydney, 24th (Havas) – Australian Federal Minister for Information Ashley made a broadcast speech to the nation today, stating, "Everyone must mobilize and serve the nation and society. We have already drafted a Pacific defense plan and have notified the British, American, and Dutch governments."

Perth, Australia, 24th (Havas) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated that he advocates that Australia should also send a representative to participate in the Imperial War Cabinet in London and requests the establishment of a Pacific Military Conference, to be jointly organized by representatives of the participating nations.

Washington, 24th (Reuters) – Australian Ambassador to the United States Casey met with President Roosevelt today to deliver a letter from Australian Prime Minister Curtin to the President. Curtin had previously requested that the United States assist Australia with aircraft and other military supplies to deter the Japanese advance. When reporters asked if the letter reiterated the previous request, the ambassador smiled and did not answer.

London, 25th (Havas) – Chairman of the Trades Union Congress Citrine recently delivered a speech at the Congress, stating that the people of Australia and New Zealand are currently in a very dangerous situation.

The Soviet people deeply understand that the crisis of this winter's battle is not over, and we are still in the early stages of the war.

### Report on Pearl Harbor Attack Released

Washington, 25th (Havas) – Regarding the Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7th of last year, President Roosevelt appointed Supreme Court Justice Roberts to organize a special committee to conduct an investigation. The committee's report to the President has now been released, proving that the former Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Kimmel, and the former Commander of the Hawaiian Military District, Lieutenant General Short, "neglected their duties and, after receiving warnings, failed to discuss and implement timely precautionary measures" and should bear full responsibility. It was found that on November 27th of last year, ten days before the start of the war, the Director of Military Intelligence had warned the Hawaiian Army and Navy authorities that negotiations with Japan had "effectively ceased, and hostilities may ensue; precautions should be taken against surprise attacks." At the same time, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark also sent a long cable to Admiral Kimmel, stating that Japan would take offensive action within days and that the Philippine Islands would likely be attacked by the Army and Navy, and even the Malay Peninsula and Borneo were at risk of being attacked. Since then, warnings have been issued daily, but those responsible in Hawaii remained unmoved, believing that there was no risk of an air raid and only the possibility of submarine attacks and other destructive actions. Lieutenant General Short and Admiral Kimmel, while acknowledging that an air raid was possible, mistakenly believed that such an attack would fail. Thus, the attack on December 7th of last year was completely unexpected by them. Prior to the attack, the Japanese side had clearly obtained sufficient intelligence and learned that no long-range reconnaissance aircraft were deployed near Hawaii on the 6th of that month, and even aerial patrols along the coast of Oahu were absent. The Japanese military was fully aware of the exact locations of our main airfields, aircraft hangars, and major warships. Each airman of that country must have been equipped with maps and detailed intelligence, enabling them to attack our airfields and warships according to the map and take advantage of the opportunity to attack. Regarding the defense of Pearl Harbor, the Army and Navy personnel were sufficient in number and were prepared for combat. Although there were instances of soldiers drinking alcohol on the eve of the attack, this did not significantly reduce their combat capabilities. Although the lack of military equipment was a reality, if all available equipment could have been used and properly guarded, it would not have been a loss. Furthermore, the responsible leaders in Hawaii had formulated various plans, which, if implemented, would have been sufficient to deal with the situation effectively.

### British House of Commons to Debate Military Affairs

London, 25th (Havas) – The House of Commons will debate military affairs in the coming days, especially military affairs in the Far East. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Churchill will put forward a vote of confidence to request that Parliament express its stance, as he has stated that he must know exactly where the Cabinet stands before the nation. It is expected that when the House convenes, some members will harshly criticize certain Cabinet ministers, but the Prime Minister's response will likely be that all Cabinet members bear joint responsibility, thereby requesting a vote of confidence to gauge support. The Prime Minister's decision to deal with the situation in this way is likely due to his deep belief that the situation in the Pacific may gradually improve in the coming weeks. In addition, the return of former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps has sparked various speculations, and there are widespread questions about what position he will hold in the future. Considering the recent surge of favorable press coverage of Cripps, it can be seen that his prestige today is second only to that of Prime Minister Churchill. Moreover, it is rumored that young members of the Labor Party will request Cripps to become the leader of their faction, but whether he will accept the offer is unknown.

Washington, 24th (Havas) – Secretary of State Hull stated that since the current Pan-American Conference opened in Rio de Janeiro, it has achieved great results in strengthening the common resistance to aggression in the Western Hemisphere.

However, after the announcement of this resolution, the delegations of Chile and Argentina put forward some reservations. Chilean Foreign Minister Rossetti declared the reservation of rights, strongly arguing that all countries in the Americas have the freedom to act independently based on full sovereignty. Argentine Foreign Minister Guaniasu declared that his government agrees to take action to prevent various activities that harm the interests of the Americas. The conference immediately passed a resolution to closely monitor the activities of foreigners that could harm the defense of the Western Hemisphere.

### Increased Price of Imported Rice Takes Effect Today; Rice Merchants’ Stock Levels Not Abundant; Closed Rice Shops to be Issued New Licenses

The authorities of the two concessions have jointly agreed that, starting today (26th), the price of imported rice will be changed to four yuan and three jiao in legal tender per three liters (an increase of two jiao from before). This price applies to all kinds of imported rice, such as Saigon No. 13, Xiao Jiao, Huo Jiao, and Siam, except for broken rice. Therefore, all residents who purchase imported rice from rice shops starting today must prepare four yuan and three jiao in advance in order to purchase three liters of rice each time. Currently, for the sake of expediting retail procedures, rice shops do not keep small change for refunds.

Imported Rice Stock 300,000 Bags

Yesterday, a reporter learned from reliable sources that although the various Chinese and foreign rice godowns in the city have been gradually opened and released goods for the market with the permission of the Japanese side, the high-quality imported rice from Saigon, Rangoon, and Siam cannot be continuously transported to Shanghai for storage because the shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong has not been officially restored. It is reported that as of recently, the rice stocks in various rice godowns have decreased to about 300,000 bags. According to the past consumption of imported rice, the above-mentioned rice stock is only enough for more than a month's need. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the two authorities will quickly devise good policies to increase the stock of food for the people in order to prepare for the necessities of life for the citizens of the city.

Source of Rice and Grain Expected to be Smoothed

The current amount of rice stock is about 300,000 bags less than it was before the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th of last year. Therefore, the move to purchase large quantities of national and imported rice is urgent. However, overseas shipping seems to be showing signs of recovery recently, and overseas sources may gradually become smoother. At the same time, the two authorities frequently urge rice merchants to purchase large quantities of national rice, and do not restrict the transportation and quantity of national rice entering the city, which is providing convenience to rice merchants. Therefore, the overall food stock should increase slightly in the future. However, the authorities should actively promote the smoothing of the source of national and imported rice. Simply increasing the price of imported rice will increase the burden on residents and is not a good policy.

Yesterday was Sunday, and all rice shops stopped retail sales in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Council. Regarding the Municipal Council's encouragement of grain merchants to purchase Wuhu rice and Jiangsu rice to increase the food supply in the city, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned yesterday that grain merchants believe that the purchase price limit set by the Municipal Council for local purchases is too low. At the same time, the payments for the sale of imported rice sealed in various godowns have not been fully settled and refunded. Rice merchants also have economic difficulties in purchasing Anhui rice and Jiangsu rice. Therefore, this matter is still being planned.

Guild Applies for Business Licenses

According to news from the Rice Shops and Grain Guild of this city, about 350 member rice shops have been forced to close, and the problem of unemployed rice workers is extremely serious. Representatives were sent to request the two concession authorities to find ways to provide relief. The responsible persons of the authorities verbally promised to issue business licenses specifically for selling national rice in order to relieve the urgent situation and maintain the livelihoods of merchants. It is now learned that the industry guild has prepared an official document and plans to apply to the two authorities for new business licenses within three days. If this can proceed smoothly, the closed rice shops may be able to resume selling national rice immediately in order to avoid the threat of employee unemployment.

Rumors of Unified Control of Rice, Wheat, and Coarse Grains

It was previously widely rumored in the markets under the jurisdiction of the Rice, Wheat, Coarse Grain, and Oilcake Guild that the two concession authorities, in order to prevent various coarse grains such as rice flour, wheat flour, beans, edible oil, and corn flour from being illegally hidden, have drafted measures to implement unified control in the short term. It is said that at that time, there will be new regulations on the quantity purchased by retailers and residents. However, according to inquiries to the two authorities, their responsible persons stated that although the two authorities have this plan for unified control of coarse grains, it has not yet been officially decided. Judging from the authorities' consistent policy of suppressing prices and strictly cracking down on hoarding essential materials, implementation is possible. However, detailed measures are still being discussed.

### North China Coal Transported to Shanghai for Sale

The city's briquette coal reserves are currently ample. However, both municipal authorities' coal management committees are proactively seeking ways to increase coal supply to Shanghai in anticipation of future needs and to bolster reserves. The two authorities have already reached an agreement with relevant parties to allow large quantities of coal to be transported from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai for sale. However, the monthly amount transported to Shanghai may be subject to appropriate restrictions to ensure a widespread supply. Coal merchants who intend to procure coal from North China are required to notify the authorities in advance for statistical purposes. Upon arrival in Shanghai, the coal must also be reported to the authorities. While the inventory in small coal depots in Pudong, Hongkou, Huxi, and the French Concession has decreased slightly compared to before December 8th of last year, those familiar with the coal market estimate that the current briquette coal reserves are still around 200,000 tons, with bituminous coal accounting for a larger share. The demand for anthracite coal this winter has declined compared to previous years, possibly due to high prices, user conservation, and difficulties in procurement. Therefore, there should be no shortage of coal supply in the future.

### Cake and Bun Trade Association Plans to Sell Half-Price Buns - Each Weighing Two Ounces and Priced at One Dime - To Commence Upon Site Determination

The city's Cake and Bun Trade Association, with over 300 member businesses, has been receiving affordable flour allocations from the Municipal Council since December 5th of last year, totaling 2,626 bags. The association, in addition to distributing the flour proportionally to its members' daily needs, is deeply grateful for the Municipal Council's concern for the people's food supply and its consideration for the difficulties faced by businesses. Recently, recognizing that it is the height of winter and the end of the year, and that the lives of ordinary people are becoming increasingly difficult, the association intends to allocate flour and produce a large quantity of large buns to be sold at half price, starting immediately, to alleviate the hunger and cold of the general public. Each bun will be priced at one dime, with eight buns weighing one market catty (市斤). Each person will be limited to purchasing two buns. The association is currently searching for a suitable location, and a public announcement will be made once it is determined, with a one-week trial run. If the operation is successful, the association will explore ways to implement it separately in various districts of the city. It is said that the association's goal is to benefit ordinary people, and significant losses are expected.

### Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and Other Bookstores Resume Business Yesterday

The city's Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Datong Bookstore, Kaiming Bookstore, and Guangming Bookstore, as well as other bookstores of various sizes, have been sealed off and suspended business for nearly a month. Following negotiations, they were gradually unsealed starting last week. However, due to the long period of closure, the bookstores needed time to reorganize their interiors and clean up, and were unable to start business immediately. All bookstores resumed business uniformly from 1 PM yesterday.

### British Public Motor Bus Company Schedules Severance Pay Distribution - To Be Distributed on the 28th at the Factory

According to sources at the Kang Nao Tuo Road British-owned China Public Motor Bus Company, the severance pay for the company's remaining 1,000-plus employees was originally scheduled to be distributed on the 20th of this month. Unfortunately, an incident occurred in the Western District on that day, and several sections were sealed off. Most of the company's employees live within the sealed-off area, preventing them from going to the company to collect their pay. It is now learned that the company has reached an agreement with the relevant authorities to partially open the route from the Western District to the factory on Kang Nao Tuo Road, so that workers can go to collect their pay. It has been decided that on the 28th of this month, from 9 AM to 4 PM, workers will be allowed to pass through the route from Kang Nao Tuo Road north to Yanping Road, then west through Singapore Road, and from the southern end of the lane on that road to Kang Nao Tuo Road, to reach the factory and collect their severance pay.

### Shanghai Gas Company Plans to Convert to Gas-Powered Vehicles - Costs Half as Much as Using Gasoline

The Times reports that a reporter visited an official at the Shanghai Gas Company yesterday, who stated that the supply of gasoline in the city is decreasing daily. When it becomes impossible to obtain oil even for important matters, various inconveniences will immediately arise. To avoid these inconveniences, the company is planning to convert its private cars and cargo trucks to gas-powered vehicles. The conversion only requires the addition of a gas storage tank, two regulators, and a carburetor, as well as a gas compression ball for filling. Each filling is said to be sufficient for ten to fifteen miles. The company also plans to set up two gas filling stations in Yangshupu and Yu Qiaqing Road. According to the official, converting a truck costs about 1,500 yuan, while converting a private car is cheaper. Using gas can save half the cost compared to using gasoline, and it does not damage the engine. The company already has several cars and trucks that have been converted. However, public conversion orders will not be accepted until the conversion and installation are complete within the next week. Due to the difficulty in obtaining coal and the inability to increase gas production, all conversion orders must be approved by the authorities.

### British and American Insurance Companies Taken Over by Japanese Side

### Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Application Deadline Today

The application deadline for the second session of the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship was originally set for February 2nd. However, due to the large number of applicants, which has exceeded the proposed number of awards several times over, and the limited donations, which will make distribution difficult, it has been decided to move the deadline forward to today. This was announced to the public on the 24th. Those who wish to apply but have not yet submitted their application forms should fill out the application forms strictly in accordance with the regulations and attach all necessary supporting documents, and register in person at the office before 5 PM today.

He also instructed all detectives to work in groups of three and conduct strict searches in secluded areas. If anyone is found to be acting suspiciously, they should be questioned.

### Profligate Son Accused of Murdering His Wife by Strangulation - Half a Life of Dissipation, Spending Thousands of Gold Coins Without Hesitation - Ruined and Unable to Pay Rent, Leading to Tragedy

Huang Jinchi, a profligate young man from Shanghai, used to live near the Zhao Jia Garden in Zhabei, where he owned a large building. He was a frequent visitor to singing and dancing venues, spending thousands of gold coins without hesitation. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, his house was unfortunately destroyed in the war. He took refuge in the International Settlement, at which time he still had several thousand gold coins in his possession. He was inclined to,

indulge in extravagance,

and remained dissipated. Later, he fell in love with Li Yuzhen, a hostess at the Continental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, and planned to marry her as a concubine. Li refused to be a concubine and politely declined. However, Huang Jinchi's cost of living in the Settlement was high, and his money gradually ran out. He had no choice but to move with his wife, Zhao, to a kitchen lean-to in the house of a Mr. Yuan at No. 180, Lane 565, Xin Zha Road, living a hard life. His wife, Zhao, helped with their livelihood by selling newspapers in the nearby small market every morning, earning a small amount to support them. On the morning of March 14th of last year, because the landlord was demanding three months of unpaid rent, amounting to dozens of yuan, which they were unable to pay, his wife, Zhao, out of

concern for her reputation

, told him that she would go out to borrow money, which led to a big quarrel. Huang was unable to raise the money. When he returned home for dinner at 5 PM, he quarreled with Zhao again. In a moment of anger, he put a hemp rope on the table around Zhao's neck, strangling her to death. He fled after the incident. After the case occurred, Yang Yunfeng, a Chinese detective from the Hui Si Police Department, disguised himself as a real estate broker and lured Huang from Nanshi to the vicinity of North Shanxi Road and Tiantong Road in the International Settlement, under the pretext of negotiating to buy Huang's ancestral land in Zhabei, worth more than 20,000 yuan. He was arrested and sent to the Special First Court. After several interrogations, Judge Gao, who was presiding over the case, carefully examined it in court, seeking details without bias. He asked Huang if he had

committed this heinous act

because he wanted to marry the hostess Li Yuzhen. The defendant insisted that it was due to domestic economic difficulties and that he had committed the crime in a moment of anger. He also said that Li and his wife, Zhao, had known each other for years, and that he had no intention of marrying her as a concubine, and asked for leniency. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, indicted him for murder and requested a thorough investigation. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled the sentencing for next Saturday.

Recognizing this, the association, in addition to distributing white congee to more than 3,000 people every morning and afternoon, has also established congee kitchens at its branches in Lei Mi Road, Yangshupu, and Su, Xi, and Yi. In addition, it has organized various charitable activities, achieving remarkable results and benefiting the poor, which is truly commendable. It is reported that the association is experiencing extreme financial difficulties and hopes that philanthropists from all walks of life will provide assistance so that the program can be sustained in the long term, which would be a great merit.

The Xin Du Printing Company, recognizing that paper prices have soared recently and that calendars are no longer as readily available as in the past, which is inconvenient, and that young students often fold the corners of books to mark their place when they cannot finish reading them at once, which damages the appearance of the books and cultivates bad habits, has specially used waste paper to print commonly used bookmarks and distribute them to all sectors of society.

### Talking about Tutoring Schools

— Ya Xi

A month ago, due to environmental reasons, most of the secondary schools in Shanghai either closed down or dissolved. Time flies, and now the winter vacation is over, and it is "back-to-school busy" season as usual. After being idle for nearly a month, general students gradually feel that self-study is not as good as going to school, and those who wander around have gradually satisfied their desire for entertainment. And what about those poor teachers who have always been "without rice in the pot and without clothing on their backs"? The dozens of yuan in severance pay have long been used up, and the whip of life continues to lash down mercilessly.

Because of the above two points – eager students want to study, and poor teachers want to make a living – most of the secondary schools in Shanghai, except for a few that open as usual – and some that have changed their names – have been converted into tutoring schools due to environmental constraints, but also to solve the above two problems. Although their names vary, such as "Academy," "Tutoring School," "Tutoring College," "Intellectual Department of Life Mutual Aid Society," etc., their goals are the same: to help out-of-school youth and solve the livelihood of teachers.

Finally, we would like to offer a few hopes to those engaged in education.

First, tuition fees should not be too high. As far as I know, the tuition fee for senior high school at a certain school is 120 yuan, junior high school is 100 yuan, and room and board is 120 yuan. They also have to pay experimental material fees, pre-deposit fees, etc. If food is provided, then an average middle school student would need no less than 600 yuan every six months. In this period of difficult material resources and rampant parental unemployment, who can still walk into that noble school?

Second, there is no need to be particular about the concept of student status. The purpose of studying is to seek knowledge and learn to be human. The issue of student status is secondary.

Third, improve teachers' salaries. This is an old tune that has been sung repeatedly, and the plight of teachers has been briefly described above. But it should be noted that: do not increase student tuition fees greatly under the pretext of raising salaries. A slight increase is acceptable, but you should develop other ways, such as the "teachers' consolation money" mentioned by Mr. Wang Shu in this newspaper in the article "Tuition Fees Have Risen," which can also be implemented to make up for any deficiencies.

Leisurely Anecdotes

### Tapping Ball

— Ze Fu

Tapping ball is also known as striking ball. The Wenxian Tongkao calls it tapping ball play, saying that "it originated in the Tang Dynasty, with two tall bamboos planted, several zhang high, with nets interwoven on top, to make a gate for passing the ball. The ball workers are divided into left and right factions to compete for victory or defeat." When hitting, a ball stick is also used, with walking hits and riding hits, but usually riding hits are more common, either on horse or on donkey. As for Hu Zhe, the Tang Dynasty governor of Bianzhou, because the southern horses were small and not good at galloping, he changed to having indigenous people carry the riders on their shoulders to strike the ball, whipping them if they were lazy. It can be said that it was an unimaginable thing that had never been heard of before or seen after. This play was a common play in the army during the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, to practice the meaning of agility. The Song and Jin dynasties also detailed the ceremony and took it seriously. According to the Jin History, Ritual Records, this play is actually divided into two types: one is "dividing the crowd into two teams to compete for a ball. First, a transformation gate is erected south of the ball field, with a board placed, with a hole opened below as a gate, and a net added as a bag. The one who can seize the ball and hit it into the net bag wins." This is what is mentioned in the Wenxian Tongkao, and the system of the Tang and Song dynasties should be like this. One is "two doors facing each other at both ends, mutually repelling, with each going out of the door to win." This is quite like today's football, except for the lack of riding horses and ball sticks. The ball stick is about several feet long, with its end shaped like a crescent moon, for easy striking. The ball is made of leather in the Kang Dynasty, and softwood in the Jin Dynasty, and is hollow inside, which is different from the previous system.

### Begonia

17 Homecoming

But the next night, when she returned, in Autumn Begonia's pair of lost-looking eyes, she suddenly noticed that there was an unusually excited look on her daughter's face. Even Old Man Han was smiling and repeatedly said to Autumn Begonia:

"Business is really good today, Third Brother, if it's like this every day, what are you still worried about?"

Autumn Begonia heard this, and his heart relaxed a little.

The doctor's consultation fee was also reduced to 18 yuan per day, through the innkeeper's intercession as a regular customer, giving him a special 40% discount.

"Dad, Heaven never cuts off all paths. I hope your illness can get better this month. Money is definitely not a problem." Mei Bao looked at Autumn Begonia's thin, bony face and said quietly, her heart intertwined with feelings of grief and anxiety.

Autumn Begonia nodded slightly, forcing a bitter smile from the corner of his mouth.

He had many things he wanted to tell Mei Bao, wanted to ask Mei Bao, but he didn't say a word at the time; half of the reason was of course due to his lack of energy and inability to speak much, and the other half was because he didn't want to say it himself.

What he wanted to tell Mei Bao was his own condition. Mei Bao hoped that he would get better in a month, but he knew very clearly that this was impossible, because the glucose and calcium that the Western doctor gave him could only prevent his lungs from rapidly decaying and slightly stimulate his appetite.

### Who Is the Master of the Family?

— Yi

Regarding this question, Robert Quillen once had an answer. He said: "Whoever can use ten dollars and feels no need to state the reason, he is the master of the family."

Indeed, what he said is true, because a person who can use money without having to state the reason is the one who controls the economic power in the family.

In Chinese families, a part is controlled by the husband, and the other part is controlled by the wife. But no matter who controls it, there is always a common problem, which is that they cannot be honest with each other. The husband does not tell his wife the exact amount of income, because he wants to keep a part for himself to use; the wife is unwilling to report the daily expenses accurately, because she wants to accumulate a small private savings. This situation is indeed a great obstacle to the health and happiness of the family organization.

Previously, the American Association of Marriage Relations conducted tests on hundreds of couples, and the results showed that whether the husband or wife alone controlled the family's economic power, it could not produce excellent results in the family. Only cooperation between the two is the best way.

At this time when everything is expensive, many families inevitably have quarrels between husband and wife over the issue of daily necessities. The wife complains that the husband's productivity is not enough, and the husband complains that the wife is too wasteful in her daily expenses. At this time, it is best for both parties to discuss the current family economic problems harmoniously, so as to overcome the difficulties.

In Charles Dickens' "David Copperfield," there is a clever Mr. Micawber who formulated a formula for happiness or sorrow in the family:

Income 20 pounds Expenditure 19 pounds 19 shillings 6 pence Result Happiness

Income 20 pounds Expenditure 20 pounds 0 shillings 6 pence Result Sorrow

At present, couples should understand each other, cooperate with each other, and formulate economic budgets together.

Many people may say that in the current national crisis, when income is not enough to cover expenses, what is there to talk about budgets? But whether a budget should exist is a matter of principle. If we do not engage in budgeting now in order to have a precise arrangement, will there be even less of a way in the future?

My Family Problems

### Announcement of Winning Essays, No. 15: Sunshine in the Family

— Xiao Ge

Women are the sunshine in the family; they can make the family warm. If there are no women in the family, it will become a cold, dry, and unmemorable place. My family lacks this kind of sunshine. There are four men in my family: my father, me, and two younger brothers. My mother passed away when we were very young, leaving behind us three brothers and a younger sister. My father never remarried and has been leading us for so long, but unfortunately, last spring, my sister contracted typhoid fever and also passed away. Since then, our family has lacked the warmth of sunshine.

There is often a gloomy atmosphere in the family, and this atmosphere can often only be adjusted by the gentle actions of women. For example, in our family, if Dad has something unpleasant happen outside, when he returns home, he silently broods, and he doesn't want to talk to anyone about what's on his mind. We can naturally feel the unusual atmosphere, and everyone sneaks upstairs. The third brother runs around the house, turning out all the clothes from the closet, looking for his soccer socks. The second brother stands in front of the mirror, feeling frustrated, dissatisfied with the tie he tied, taking it apart and tying it again, tying it and taking it apart again, while circling the bedpost and muttering curses under his breath. I can't concentrate on reading at all, and when I try to pick up a pen to write, I can't write a single word, feeling frustrated and at a loss. If my sister were here, she would casually find the socks under the sofa cushion for the third brother, and then walk over with a smile, sit on the table, pull the second brother over, and insist on tying his tie for him. Or, she would take some homework and sit beside me, asking me to teach her. At an appropriate time, she would go downstairs and pester my father, asking him to take her to see a movie and eat something. Because everyone loved her, they couldn't help but indulge her. The second brother, letting her tie his tie, immediately put on his coat and went out happily, no matter how much worse she tied it than he could himself. Father would also immediately put away his frown and deal with her. I would also patiently endure my frustration and teach her homework, and unconsciously, the gloom would dissipate, and the sunshine would warm our family.

I always thought that we were all compromising ourselves to make her happy. Only now do I understand that her small actions once brought warmth to the home. Although she was just a twelve-year-old girl, her naturally delicate personality made her the center of our family. Since her death, our family has been trapped in a never-ending gloom. Father's face is gloomy all day long, the third brother and the second brother have become very irritable, arguing all day long. I feel that the air pressure in the house is so low that I can't breathe. A friend told me a few days ago that my temper is becoming increasingly stubborn and that I don't want to talk to friends when I'm with them. Everything at home is in disarray. I once tried to put everyone's things in a certain place, but the third brother was the first to disobey. I wanted to make everyone happier, but my harsh words and clumsy actions resulted in a big fight with the second brother. When I realized that this was due to my sister's death, I thought that perhaps a woman could come and adjust us, but my father would definitely not remarry, and none of us brothers are old enough to marry. Even if one of us got married, could a stranger replace the position of love and affection between siblings that my sister had with us since childhood? If this continues, my father may die of depression, and we brothers may go to extremes, and I don't know what strange personalities we will develop. I think worriedly, how can I adjust my family?

Editor's Note: From the handwriting in your original manuscript, one can indeed see your agitated emotions. Women are originally indispensable and important figures in the family, and without women, a family cannot become complete. In childhood, a girl's gentle nature is truly the sunshine in the family, but you have not yet tasted the most precious maternal love in the world. Therefore, civilized Westerners absolutely respect women. In elevators, they take off their hats when they see women, and everywhere, they always let women go first. When men and women walk together, men should walk on the outside and let women occupy the safe area.

There is also one thing worth telling you. Ikesdan, a professor of biology at West New Nanna University in the United States, once said that when he studied medicine at school for several years, he didn't learn much, but later he met one or two women and learned a lot.

In your situation, since your father will not remarry and your brothers are not yet of marriageable age, it is impossible to add a woman to the family. You might as well look for proper pastimes to adjust your spirits.

As for the phrase "the position of love and affection between siblings since childhood, can a stranger replace it," that is wrong, because you have not yet understood the art of marriage.

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The flavor of large Chinese cabbage is indeed getting better every day after the frost. However, vegetable sellers often sprinkle water on it to make the weight heavier, and once it freezes, it cannot be cooked until it is soft, and the flavor is also worse. Therefore, to eat large Chinese cabbage, you must eat "dry-headed cabbage" (that is, cabbage that is not watered) to taste good; "watered cabbage" is unacceptable. In recent days, rosette bok choy has been on the market in large quantities, priced at around 30 cents per catty. Although it is more expensive than large Chinese cabbage, the weight is lighter, so it is not considered expensive, and the flavor is no less than that of large Chinese cabbage, because it is already in season and does not have the slightly bitter taste of earlier or later crops. Therefore, these days, if you want to eat green vegetables, you should eat rosette bok choy, either stir-fried or added to hot pot with frozen tofu and sliced pork; both are excellent seasonal dishes.

Monday: Salted Pork and Tofu Soup, Sweet and Sour Fried Beltfish, Stir-Fried Rosette Bok Choy, Jellyfish and Radish Salad

Tuesday: Soybean Sprouts with Beef, Oyster Omelet, Braised Spinach with Tofu, Celery with Sesame Paste

Wednesday: Stir-Fried Bamboo Shoots with Shredded Pork, Scallion-Roasted Small Fish, Chestnut and Cabbage Heart Stir-Fry, Vegetarian Tofu Soup

Thursday: Beef and Vermicelli Stir-Fry, Pickled Mustard Greens with Braised White Fish, Braised Cabbage, Vinegar-Glazed Julienned Mustard Greens

Friday: Pig's Feet with Stewed Yellow Soybeans, Fish Ball and Spinach Soup, Mustard Green and Tofu Soup, Dried Tofu Strips and Bean Sprouts

Saturday: Braised Lamb with Kelp, Noodles with Green Fish, Braised Vegetarian Ten Delights, Bamboo Shoot Tips and Frozen Tofu

Sunday: Ten Delights Hot Pot, Steamed Beltfish, Rosette Bok Choy

### (157) Braised "Leather Stick" Chicken

— Draft by Qi Zurong

Preparation: Half a catty of "leather stick" (Method for making "leather stick": When picking up tofu skin from the pot, roll it around a half-inch thick and two-foot long wooden stick. Only one sheet can be rolled onto each stick each day, and it must be allowed to dry before removing it and rolling a new one. After rolling it to about half an inch thick, cut it open and remove the wooden stick, and it becomes the "leather stick"). One young chicken, dried scallops, Baiwei (a kind of dried small fish), wood ear mushrooms, monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, salt, ginger, white sugar, cooking wine, scallions.

Method: First, kill the young chicken, use hot water to pluck the chicken feathers and remove the internal organs, and wash it clean. The scallops, Baiwei, "leather stick", etc., should also be washed with warm water. Then, mix the Baiwei and dried scallops with three tablespoons of cooking wine for a moment. Cut the chicken and "leather stick" into small rectangular pieces. Take the chicken and put it in a pot with plenty of water and bring it to a boil first, and skim off the floating membrane. Separately, soak the wood ear mushrooms in boiling water, and add them together with the "leather stick", dried scallops, Baiwei, etc. At the same time, add an appropriate amount of soy sauce, salt, cooking wine, sugar, chopped scallions, and minced ginger, etc. Simmer over low heat for about two hours, and then add monosodium glutamate before serving. The more tenderly it is simmered, the better. This dish can be regarded as the best of dishes, especially the taste of the "leather stick", which is both tender and fresh. With the help of the young chicken, it is very delicious.

Gentlemen: If you want to purchase "monosodium glutamate", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence", and oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, please call "44594", and a special messenger will deliver them immediately, without charging a delivery fee.
