### German Troops Advance Towards the Caspian Sea: Grozny Surrounded, Battle for Stalingrad Rages, Soviet Union Calls for National Unity to Defend Against the Enemy

Reuters, Lisbon, 17th: According to a broadcast from Vichy at 5 PM, German forces have advanced to within 120 kilometers of the Caspian Sea and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Soviet troops.

Havas, Ukrainian Border, 18th: German and Romanian forces are steadily advancing towards the Caucasus. They have reportedly reached the vicinity of the Kuban River estuary, 18 miles north of the port of Anapa, at a place called Gastogay. In the central Caucasus, German vanguards have reportedly crossed the Batalpashchinsk and reached the vicinity of Chermalinsk, southeast of Adygeysk. German armored units suddenly penetrated the outskirts of Ordzhonikidze yesterday afternoon, and fierce street fighting is now taking place within the city. To the east of that area, German forces reached Betlovsky, 9 miles east of Grozny, yesterday. This morning, other units also arrived 18 miles west of Grozny, thus encircling the city. The city of Belnaya, south of Stalingrad, was occupied on the 15th of this month. It has also been confirmed that German forces are advancing from Elista towards Astrakhan, with the vanguard only 120 miles southeast of the port. Fierce fighting is taking place around Stalingrad. There was also a bloody battle near Ilovlinkaya yesterday morning, and the city is on the verge of falling. The Soviet troops in the Kalach district are putting up strong resistance. German armored car units are advancing along a six-mile front and have already crossed several miles north of the city.

Havas, Stockholm, 18th: Moscow considers the situation around Stalingrad to be very urgent. German engineers have built pontoon bridges on the Don River. The Don River loop is about 120 miles long, and the Soviet Union seems unable to prevent the German army from crossing the river. Soviet troops had gathered on the Godelnikovo highway to prevent the German army from attacking from the southwest. The right wing of this army is now under serious threat, so the German army's situation is becoming more favorable.

Havas, Moscow, 17th: The General Staff of the Red Army recently issued a battle report stating, "In the past 24 hours, our army fought southeast of Kletskaya and northeast of Kotelnikovo. Enemy forces launched repeated attacks, but they were all repelled by our army. Our army held its original positions and remained steadfast. In addition, the Red Army resisted enemy tank and motorized infantry units in the Mineralaanya-Vod region."

Havas, Moscow, 17th: Alexander, the Minister of Propaganda of the Communist Party, delivered a radio address to officers and soldiers of the Red Army and the Soviet Navy today, stating, "The German army is now approaching important centers of our country, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious, even more so than in the summer and autumn of last year. At this moment, the German side is concentrating all its reserve troops, attempting to occupy the richest regions of the Soviet Union, especially the republics in our south, which are famous for producing oil, wheat, and other raw materials. We must find ways to contain them so that they cannot pass through. Therefore, the Red Army will launch a large-scale counter-offensive this year to prevent them from advancing. In the past two months, the Red Army has suffered setbacks, and the reason for this is probably that the German side has transferred all its reserve troops and all its material resources to the front line for combat. In the last World War, Germany was able to resist for four years, even while fighting on two fronts. Today, Germany is only fighting on the Soviet front, and its strength is naturally expected to be great. But in any case, the Red Army's resistance is getting stronger and stronger. The immediate task is to stop the enemy from continuing to advance south. We must regard all the weak and wavering elements in our country as traitors and eliminate them all. In short, if we can stop the enemy from advancing, then the Soviet Union will be assured of ultimate victory."

German Troops March on the Caucasian Front Amidst Suffocating Dust

Haitong Agency, Berlin, 18th: German war correspondent Lorenz writes that the greatest difficulty encountered by the German army, which is currently advancing towards the Caucasus Mountains, is the dust flying everywhere. The Battle of Bataisk was a vast grassland. After passing this, the German army began to reach the cool foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. Armored car units were covered in dust, alongside the infantry column on a rapid march. Handkerchiefs had to be wiped across the face, immediately turning gray. Military uniforms were also covered in dust, appearing as a gray column from a distance.

Havas, Berlin, 18th: The General Headquarters announced this morning that the German army and its allies continued to advance towards the Caucasus yesterday, braving the heat and traversing rugged terrain. Twelve enemy ships were sunk by our air force in the Black Sea ports, and one large oil tanker and eight ammunition ships were damaged. Since the 15th of this month, 12,800 Red Army soldiers have been captured northeast of the Don River loop, and 47 tanks and 252 field guns have been lost. Red Army counterattacks east of Vyazma and in the Rzhev area have all failed. Since the 30th of last month, the Red Army has lost 1,068 tanks.

### Remarkable Achievements of Japanese Submarines Since the Start of the War: Over a Hundred Ships Sunk

Domei, Tokyo, 17th: The Japanese General Headquarters announced today that Japanese submarines have sunk another ten enemy ships in the seas around Australia from late July to early August. Qualified observers have recently commented on this, saying that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japanese submarines have sunk 115 enemy ships, totaling 884,000 tons. This is a remarkable achievement, as Japanese submarines must patrol the vast areas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans to search for their spoils, which is not as easy as the congested shipping lanes between America and Europe in the Atlantic Ocean and along the coast of the United States. Now that the enemy has lost another ten transport ships, totaling about 90,000 tons, as announced today, it will be a fatal blow to Australia. If Australia continues to cling to the illusion of relying on Britain and the United States and ignores Japan's control of the ocean, then its days are numbered.

### Sapru's Proposal Not Yet Accepted by the British: Continued Riots in Calcutta, Muslim League Executive Committee Continues Meeting

Haitong Agency, Stockholm, 18th: According to Swedish newspapers, news from London last night stated that the proposals put forward in the speeches of two major Indian politicians, Sapru and Rajagopalachari (former Premier of Madras), have not been adopted by London.

Havas, Rome, 17th: The mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, Gaeda, recently published an article in the Italian Daily, stating, "Previously, Britain and America had attempted to land on the Mediterranean coast, but as a result of fierce sea and air battles, the Axis powers have won a complete victory. What exactly is the plan of Britain and America? Why have they sent such a large fleet into the Mediterranean? One cannot help but have various speculations. It is true that Malta should be reinforced and resupplied, but the fleet that Britain and America attempted to force through the Strait of Sicily is so large that it cannot be accommodated by the port of Malta. In our estimation, Britain and America have even greater ambitions. According to the reconnaissance photos of our aircraft, it has been proven that British and American warships and transport ships are equipped with small boats, one of which is about 50 feet long. Moreover, after many battles, British warships would turn back and return whenever they sailed to the Strait of Sicily, but this time they ignored the resistance of our air force and still attempted to force through. Its mission must undoubtedly be important. It is not impossible for Britain and America to attempt to land on the Mediterranean coast of Europe or Africa. If so, then the significance of the Axis powers' great victory in the sea and air battles will be even more important." A German torpedo boat sunk.

### Anglo-American-Soviet Cooperation in War, Important Resolutions Reached, Anglo-Soviet Alliance Reaffirmed, Churchill Returns to London with Harriman

Moscow, 17th (Domei) - The Soviet government announced on the 17th regarding Churchill's visit to the Soviet Union that, during his stay in Moscow from August 12th to 15th, Churchill held several consultations with Stalin, and the heads of the two governments reached important decisions regarding the conduct of the war, and further reaffirmed the alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union in the war against Germany and its European allies.

Ankara, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a special dispatch from Moscow, British Prime Minister Churchill arrived in Moscow on the 12th of this month and, after a three-day meeting with Soviet leaders, flew from Moscow yesterday morning back to London. Accompanying him was Harry Hopkins, the special representative for U.S. war supplies. The plane he took had four engines and was the same one Churchill used to fly to Moscow.

London, 17th (Havas) - Regarding the results of the Moscow Conference, the official communique was released tonight as follows: "Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, Stalin, and British Prime Minister Churchill held an important meeting in Moscow. President Roosevelt's representative Harriman, Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov, Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army General Voroshilov, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps, British Chief of Staff General Brooke, Undersecretary of the Foreign Office Cadogan, and British military representatives were present. Important decisions were made regarding the common war against Hitlerism. In essence, the British and Soviet governments have decided to devote all their resources to the war until Hitlerism and its tyranny collapse. The negotiations were conducted with utmost sincerity, and the two governments had the opportunity to reaffirm their close and seamless relationship, which is fully supported by the United States regarding the Anglo-Soviet alliance.

Progress of the Three-Power Talks

London, 17th (Havas) - According to an official announcement, Prime Minister Churchill flew to Moscow at 4:00 AM on the 12th of this month aboard a four-engine "Liberator" bomber, accompanied by President Roosevelt's personal representative Harriman, the Prime Minister's personal physician, and secretary. Soon after, a British-American delegation of twenty people arrived, including key figures such as Chief of the Imperial General Staff Sir Brooke, Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office Cadogan, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in India General Wavell, Commander of the British Air Force in the Middle East Tedder, Commander of the American Forces in Egypt Major General Maxwell, and American Major General Patton. Upon arriving in Moscow, the Prime Minister told the press that the purpose of this trip was to express Britain's determination to fight alongside the Soviet Union in the current difficult situation, and that no matter how difficult the future may be, the two countries will fight until Hitlerism is eliminated from the earth. When Churchill and Harriman disembarked, Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov, Red Army Chief of Staff General Shaposhnikov, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Admiral Standley, and General Bradley, who had just arrived from Washington a few days ago, were at the airport to welcome them. The short speeches given by Churchill and Harriman were recorded for future broadcast. That evening, the two British and American giants held their first meeting with Stalin, which lasted for more than four hours. Churchill and Stalin were meeting for the first time. The next day, Churchill spoke with Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov for a long time, and in the afternoon, he held a second meeting with Stalin. By the 14th of this month, several important negotiations had been held. Stalin hosted a banquet at the Kremlin for Prime Minister Churchill and the British and American representatives. All the key members of the Soviet government were present. The atmosphere was harmonious, and the conversations were no different from those during negotiations. Stalin, Cripps, and Standley all raised their glasses in toasts, and the event ended in joy at midnight. The next afternoon, Churchill and Harriman visited the outskirts of Moscow, and in the evening, Churchill had his final meeting with Stalin. However, complete agreements on all important issues had been reached in previous meetings. Harriman participated in every meeting between the two leaders. According to Harriman's statement to the Soviet press, "The U.S. President ordered me to accompany Prime Minister Churchill on this trip at this crucial moment. The President had already expressed his agreement in advance on the decisions to be taken at the Anglo-Soviet meeting. It is clear that the United States is determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union on the battlefield." The Anglo-Soviet talks concluded on the 15th of this month. According to an official announcement from here, important decisions have been made on all issues related to the war, but the specific measures and content of the decisions will not be disclosed. After returning to London, Prime Minister Churchill immediately sent a telegram to Stalin expressing his gratitude. The telegram read, "I am deeply grateful for your kind hospitality during my visit to your capital. I dare to express my gratitude in this telegram. I found this trip to be one of the most gratifying experiences of my life, as it gave me the opportunity to explain everything to you, which is my responsibility, and to meet with you, which will be of great benefit to the cooperation between our two countries. I hope you will understand my humble intentions and please convey my regards to your Foreign People's Commissar Molotov."

Wavell's Participation is of Great Significance

Goose Bay, 18th (Domei) - It is reported that observers here believe that the participation of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in India, in the Moscow Conference is of great significance, and that concrete suggestions for lifting the siege of the Soviet forces defending the Caucasus and opening a second front were likely discussed at the conference. According to Reuters dispatches received here, General Wavell has recently been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Indian 10th Army, which is being established in Iran.

Rumors of Separate Peace Eliminated

Stockholm, 18th (Havas) - According to a report from Moscow, the results of the meeting between Stalin and Churchill did not generate as much enthusiasm among the Soviet people as Molotov's visit to London and Washington in May and June to sign the Anglo-Soviet alliance. The issue of opening a second front in Europe this year seems to have been implicitly shelved. In addition, judging from the communique released yesterday in London, the two sides still need to continue "negotiations." Churchill's telegram to Stalin after returning home also stated that "full explanation is his duty." It seems that the Allied nations still need to "explain." What the Soviet people need is not explanations, but the immediate opening of a second front. However, Churchill's trip to Moscow has certainly accomplished one thing: it has eliminated rumors of a separate peace between Germany and the Soviet Union.

Speculations on the Purpose of the British Prime Minister's Visit to the Soviet Union

Berlin, 18th (Domei) - Regarding the news of the Anglo-American-Soviet Moscow talks, apart from repeated reports from Berlin, London and Moscow have made no announcements. There are many speculations about Churchill's purpose in visiting the Soviet Union. The opinions of neutral countries are summarized as follows: The rapid expansion of German military gains in the Caucasus and the serious situation on the Eastern Front have forced Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to urgently consult and discuss common countermeasures. Due to the urgent crisis on the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's demand for the establishment of a second front has become increasingly strong, but the establishment of a second front is practically impossible for Britain and the United States. Therefore, Churchill had to personally visit the Soviet Union to meet with Soviet authorities to explain and conduct direct and concrete negotiations on issues such as arms supplies. Due to the rapid advance of the German army, the Soviet Union is increasingly in danger. Churchill's visit to the Soviet Union allows him to personally inspect the situation and conduct a thorough and final review of the Soviet Union's ability to resist and other aspects. In short, the three-power talks must be to discuss countermeasures against the defeat of the United Nations, especially on how to maintain the Soviet Union's ability to resist, is beyond doubt.

Rome, 17th (Havas) - According to a dispatch from a correspondent of the Radol News Agency stationed in Ankara, the British government, due to the defeat at Tobruk, diverted a batch of arms and equipment destined for the Soviet Union from Basra, Iraq, to North Africa, which led to the collapse of the Soviet defense line near the Caucasus. Prime Minister Churchill had no choice but to visit Moscow to explain the situation to Stalin. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps strongly advocated that the British Prime Minister personally visit Moscow.

Lisbon, 17th (Domei) - According to a dispatch from London, Churchill held talks with South African Prime Minister Smuts, who was staying in Cairo, during his transit through Cairo on his way to Moscow.

Berlin Closely Watches

Berlin, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - At yesterday's information conference at the German Foreign Ministry, Minister Schmidt, in answering questions about Churchill's trip to the Soviet Union, first pointed out that German newspapers had published a German news agency report on the nature of Churchill's meeting in the Soviet Union. He then added that the German side was paying close attention to Churchill's trip to the Soviet Union because Churchill's foreign trips were often seen as a symbol of a serious military and political situation. Minister Schmidt, in discussing Molotov's appointment as Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, stated that after this change in Soviet domestic politics, Stalin's absolute power in politics had been somewhat limited.

Tokyo, 18th (Domei) - Since the outbreak of the European War, British Prime Minister Churchill has traveled abroad five times, including this visit to Moscow. The first time was in June of the year before last, when France was about to surrender, to request the French government to continue fighting against Germany. The second time was on August 14th of last year, when he met with Roosevelt on the "Prince of Wales" to formulate the Atlantic Charter. The third time was in December of last year, when he crossed the Atlantic aboard the "Duke of York" battleship and visited the United States on the 22nd of that month. On December 26th, Churchill gave a speech at a joint session of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, then went to Canada, and returned to Washington, where he signed the anti-Axis alliance treaty of 26 countries, including Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, on January 2nd of this year. The fourth time was his second visit to the United States in June of this year. After arriving in the United States on the 18th of that month, he held several consultations with Roosevelt and returned to London on the 27th. The fifth time is this visit to Moscow. Also, since the outbreak of the war, the British officials who have visited the Soviet Union besides Churchill this time include Foreign Secretary Eden, Cripps, and Beaverbrook.

### Molotov Acting as Chairman of the People's Committee, Fully Handling All Political Affairs, Stalin Specializing in Military Affairs

Lisbon, 17th (Domei) - According to news arriving here, the rapid progress of the German-Soviet war has made Stalin, Chairman of the People's Committee, extremely busy.

Stockholm, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a report in the Gothenburg Business Journal, London political circles have stated that Molotov's appointment as Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee is the result of pressure from Britain and the United States. It is expected that there will be other changes in the Soviet government, but the reasons were not specified. Soviet officials said that Molotov's concurrent new position is due to Stalin's preoccupation with military affairs and his inability to attend to everything. According to reports from London, the Moscow Conference discussed two points: To promote the unification of Allied military strategies, which can only be achieved through changes in military strategy and personnel. A thorough reorganization of the Allied transportation system, especially the supply of arms and ammunition.

After the two concession authorities took strict measures against profiteering, a large number of shops were fined or ordered to suspend business for selling above the maximum price level, and the price increase trend was suppressed, resulting in a stable and peaceful situation. At the same time, the authorities' pressure on speculators has halted speculative market activities and eliminated the hoarding trend. It is no longer possible for a few people to manipulate the market.

The general price level has been suppressed to a stable level. It is also heard that since the implementation of the grain rationing system, the city's food situation has improved. Since the implementation of grain rationing, which has been in effect for one month and ten days, the two concessions have distributed a total of 300,000 bags of rice to the citizens, in addition to a large amount of flour. This rice was purchased with the cooperation of the Japanese authorities. Since price controls were implemented, the laundry soap market has greatly eased.

Last week, the price of "Gu Ben" soap fell to 300 yuan per case. If based on the price limits, it will further tend to fall. The prices of matches and cigarettes remained steady last week.

The Shanghai Silver Industry Provisional United Committee recently sent a letter to its member banks and money shops, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet finalized the method for converting and collecting savings bills for rent in the city. Banks with real estate are unsure how to collect rent. To this end, a small group meeting was convened to discuss a solution, which was submitted for approval. After careful review by the Association, and taking into account both the landlord and tenant, two principles were agreed upon: (1) For fixed-term leases that have not yet expired, the rent will be collected in new currency at a 25% discount from June. (2) For indefinite-term leases, the rent will be collected in new currency at a 25% discount from June, based on the original rent amount, and tenants are urged to sign lease agreements. All water fees will be paid by the tenants. The above principles are intended to provide a standard for banks that own their own properties when collecting rent. Other incidental expenses can be handled according to the situation. Further discussions will be held after the authorities stipulate a uniform method for rent collection. This is sent separately for your information. With best regards, from the Shanghai Silver Industry Provisional United Committee."

### Major Players Take Profits at High Levels, Bond Market Falls

Yesterday's unified public bond market situation was volatile and rapidly changed. Generally excited bulls saw that each bond was high and fixed, especially the C type, which not only failed to see the 40 yuan mark, but also turned back. In the trend, the buyers hesitated, so the buying sentiment that permeated the previous day was frustrated. Generally those who profited and the sellers were under this situation, and they could not but take advantage of the situation. Therefore, the selling sentiment turned stronger after entering the stage. However, retail investors tried to push the price up, and finally there were differences. At the opening in the morning, Qingan was the first to advance strongly, followed by Tongli, Tongyuan, Tongyu, Shuntai, etc., which continued to absorb quite strongly. Then, the C type saw a high price of 9 yuan and 70 cents, and A reached 40 yuan and 2 cents. However, due to the sales of major players, such as Dachung, Xinhua Bank, Runli, Hu Heji, Dakang, etc., each detective saw a small return. As a result, except for E which was good for a cent, A and D were flat, and B and C were slightly down by one or two cents. In the arena, the high-level and late-handedness of the major players hindered the entry of new long positions and the addition of old long positions. Therefore, if the absorption of regular customers is equal, it may first soften and then harden. The total turnover is about 2 million yuan. The list is shown below.

In addition, China Stock Company has recently issued a book called "Compilation of Chinese Merchant Stocks" in order to meet the needs of investors in Chinese shares. The content is quite valuable. All sectors can go directly to the company at 316 Jiangxi Road for an interview.

### Autumn and Winter Cloth Sales Look Promising; Piece Goods Merchants Unwilling to Loosen Sales

Merchants in the market east of the city yesterday were determined and confident. Although actual sales were slow, those holding goods in the industry hoped for the arrival of autumn and winter for improved prospects. Their attitude was very calm, and most were unwilling to lower prices. Prices of fine cloth rose slightly, about one yuan per piece. For example, 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 177 yuan, Flying Goose 174 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 106 yuan, 9-pound New Character 108 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth 161 yuan, Dapeng 152 yuan, Fugui 154 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth 161 yuan, Qin Liangyu 152 yuan, Longevity Mansion silk 5 yuan and 9 jiao, Changting 5 yuan and 7 jiao, Volleyball 3 yuan and 9 jiao, Three Sheep Serge 5 yuan and 9 jiao, and Qin Meiren cotton cloth 132 yuan, all showed increases. Peach Blossom Lady Lin opened at 256 yuan, fell to 254 yuan, and then rose to 258 yuan and 7 and a half jiao, an increase of more than 3 yuan.

Eastern cloth first fell and then rose, showing a firm trend. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 176 yuan, 7 jiao, and noon closed at 178 yuan and a half, an increase of 5 jiao. Bank orders were 158 yuan and a half, Color Ball 163 yuan, Flying Fish 160 yuan, and Yang He 158 yuan, all up by more than one yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge started at 7 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen, fell to 7 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen, but buyers rushed in, raising it to 7 yuan, 3 jiao at closing. In after-hours trading, it was 7 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen, a total increase of about 1 jiao, reportedly due to a shortage of Red Factory orders.

### Gold Jewelry Drops 50 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold jewelry industry in the city quoted the price of gold per tael (ounce) in Sichuan currency. It initially opened at 2,200 yuan, but around 10 o'clock, it dropped 50 yuan to 2,150 yuan (buying price reduced by 350 yuan). Cash stores quoted 2,100 yuan in Sichuan currency, also lowering by 50 yuan after 10 o'clock, with the buying price reduced by 300 yuan, some reducing by 200 yuan and quoting 1,900 yuan. The price among fellow traders continued to decline. The initial settling price was 1,890 yuan, then gradually declined by 35 yuan amidst selling pressure, falling to 1,855 yuan. The noon price was 1,860 yuan, which was a decrease of 30 yuan or 35 yuan from the previous day, with a total volume of over one hundred taels. Silver ingots were still quoted at 16 yuan per tael, with an inter-dealer price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 8.9 fen.

### Military Scrip Slightly Down

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, the inter-dealer price of military scrip slightly retreated to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 5.6 li, with storefront buy/sell quotes at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and a half, and 6 fen and a half.

Yesterday, the discount rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 1 jiao and 6 fen, with new calls for balancing spot cash.

### Bean Trade Sparse; Dried Sweet Potato Prices Remain Firm

The bean trade was quite slow yesterday, and the market was calm. Only 60 bags of Chongming sand silkworms were sold in the general market, priced at 122 yuan to 123 yuan.

The price of dried sweet potatoes was slightly lower due to the lack of burlap bags and the change to grass bags for packaging, but the underlying trend remained firm. Yesterday, 40 bags of Qingdao dried sweet potatoes were offered at 106 yuan, and 20 bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes were offered at 107 yuan, all self-offered.

Red sorghum arrivals and sales were both quiet, and trading had been scarce for a long time. Yesterday, 50 bags of Mingguang red sorghum were sold at 109 yuan and a half.

The actual demand for bran remained weak, and the market showed little sign of improvement. Yesterday, 400 small bags of Sanxin bran from May inventories were offered at 99 yuan to 100 yuan.

### Sugar Stock Trading Increases Slightly

Yesterday, the sugar stock orders at the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office were stable and firm according to the market association's settlement. Coarse sand shares opened at 296 yuan and closed at 296 yuan and a half. Red sand shares remained at 287 yuan, and Taikoo HX Mark white shares were at 287 yuan. Trading increased slightly, with a total of 1,300 bags traded.

### New Watermelon Seeds Already on the Market

The four bags of new black watermelon seeds that arrived from Guzhen a few days ago had been shelved for many days without hope of improvement. Yesterday, they were settled at 450 yuan, indicating that the market remains weak. However, the production price is still upside down, and losses must still be absorbed.

### Hawthorn Slices

The market price for old hawthorn slices remains stable, with recent arrivals being scarce. Stocks in the market are gradually returning to Sichuan, so prices are moderate. Yesterday, a certain company offered 80 bags, the goods were still good, but the color was slightly inferior, and they were settled at 105 yuan. Recently, the Guangdong merchants' appetite for stomachics has gradually increased, while the pharmaceutical merchants' transactions are not many, and the market is stable.

### National and Japanese Cigarettes

Active hoarding...Market sentiment remains firm. The cigarette market has seen gradual price increases due to hoarding and strong actual sales. Hoarders of British and American goods are not moving, and prices are stable. The market for national and Japanese cigarettes remains brisk, making it difficult for prices to fall. Yesterday, Great Britain brand was quoted at 8,450 yuan, Old Knife brand at 5,700 yuan, Pinhai brand at 5,100 yuan, Small Fairy brand at 4,300 yuan, Five Flowers brand at 4,100 yuan, Japanese Golden Gun brand at 1,830 yuan, Golden Mansion at 2,280 yuan, Quanlu brand at 1,980 yuan, Nianzhi Quanlu had the same price, Guide brand at 1,580 yuan, National Golden Mouse brand at 1,800 yuan, Beautiful brand at 3,150 yuan, and Pyramid at 3,300 yuan. Transactions in daily necessities are sluggish, and prices remain stable.

### A New Batch of Guanmi Rice Has Arrived

Tonglai Company cabled that they had found a way to transport a batch of Guanmi rice, which is currently in season and in short supply in Shanghai, so the market is quite firm. The asking price is reportedly 550 yuan. According to investigations, there are still old stocks in the market, and although they are worm-eaten, it does not affect the quality, as the worm-eaten part is only the core of the rice, which should be removed anyway, and it is said to taste soft and delicious when cooked.

### Two High-Pitched Beards (Part 1)

— Sick Dove

—— Song Shiluo and Ji Yuliang

Regardless of the skill, it has been a long time in circulation, due to changes in the times and environment, and has undergone extreme changes. The occurrence of this change, in other words, is the origin of factional divergence. In recent years, actors have been deficient in talent, their voices and bearing have declined, and they have also been tempted by the environment, hurting themselves. Those who study the old male roles only learn Tan Xinpei's softness, not his strength, learn the decline of translation, not the arrogance of Tan Xinpei; thus, the tone becomes shorter and shorter, and the bearing becomes weaker and weaker, resulting in the current situation of decadent sounds.

The recent arrival of the two actors, Song Shiluo and Ji Yuliang, in Shanghai has given us great excitement. Regardless of their singing style, listening to their high-pitched and joyful voices is enough to make people feel uplifted and amazed. Now that Song and Ji have stopped singing, the lingering sound is still in my ears, so I will roughly talk about the general situation of their artistic careers.

Song Shilu's voice is high-pitched, his breath is full, and his pronunciation is crisp and surprising, implicitly containing a sense of solemnity. He is proficient in inverted boards and beer tunes, and he also uses long tunes occasionally, with twists and turns, combining rigidity and softness, with rising and falling tones, deeply grasping the method of releasing and controlling. His style is quite similar to Gao Qingkui. Although his low voice is also leisurely and free, it has a subtle charm, but tasting his voice carefully, it is subtle, but lacks gentleness, and the edges and corners are repeatedly seen, because the strength is not enough. It is easy to sing high and difficult to sing low in singing pronunciation. It is especially difficult to emit low and fine sounds and be able to be round, smooth, and flexible. In the past, Tan Xinpei was famous for his good singing, and today Yu Shusheng's success in the music world is all due to this. Bao Wei still needs to work hard on this point. As for the unpleasantness of the middle voice, it is a major problem. Often, after the extremely wonderful inverted board, the original board is plain and has no wonders, which is very disappointing. The reason for this is that he is young, strong, and full of energy, and he relies entirely on his good voice to win, and has not paid attention to the study of phonology. It is important to know that a grand spirit is selling the voice, not the singing, and at best it is only a figure like Xu Yintang. Now that Baoluo is young and has a good voice, if he can learn from the singing methods of famous artists, remove the fierceness, take the sincerity, and absorb the strengths of others and integrate them into his own, then the future can be hoped for.

Visiting a Dancer

### Fei Yin's Comeback

— Wei Ren

Fei Yin has not appeared on the dance stage for a long time. Perhaps people's impressions of her are slowly fading and becoming unfamiliar. In fact, she has never given up her interest in drama. In this forgotten and unfamiliar process, she has been working with Mei Qian. The love between the two of them is completely built on their careers. In other words, they recognize each other, understand each other, and work hard together.

Recently, she signed a contract with the Zhongzhong Drama Troupe, which will perform at the Lihua Grand Theatre. The reporter conducted a brief interview with her on the day she signed the contract:

"It's been almost a year since you performed on stage. Why did you join the Zhongzhong Troupe this time?" This was the first question I asked.

"Mr. Lengshan came to me about performing at Zhongzhong. I originally planned to return to the stage to learn some knowledge. I know my own insignificance and weakness. I believe that with constant effort, there will be great achievements," she said in a very solemn manner.

"Then what are your thoughts on the Zhongzhong Drama Troupe?" I waited for her valuable opinion.

"The Zhongzhong Drama Troupe is a new troupe. Although some of the artists working in it are also my friends from the past, I always think that a new troupe has its own new vitality and spirit. I am willing to accept new inspirations and create new life?" Her conversation was full of new power.

Next, she talked about some of her past and present life.

She is from Beiping and grew up in Tianjin. She studied at Beiping Women's University and has a good understanding of music. She knows many Chinese and Western musical instruments. She and Mei Qian met when he was teaching in Tianjin. Later, after coming to Shanghai, she joined "Tianfeng" and performed in many plays such as "Crossroads," "Gratitude and Hatred," "Tao Yu Ji," and "Isolated Island Men and Women," among which Yang Zhiying in "Crossroads" was the most successful.

Fei Yin, who has made a comeback, is a brilliant flower in the Zhongzhong Drama Troupe!

### Inside the Circle

— Guan Hua

Bai Yun left Shanghai for Qingdao early yesterday morning (the 18th). The purpose of this trip is to activate the local drama scene and return to Shanghai on the first of next month to devote all efforts to the performance of A Fallen City.

The 20th Century Art Troupe has changed its plans because Lido Theater has not given a definite answer. They will try to perform "Rouge Tiger" at the Russian Art Defense Theater on the 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th for four days. The performance of "Spring Flowers" may be after the autumn coolness.

The Weiming Troupe is rushing to rehearse "Blood and Tears." The play is scheduled to be staged at the Xuan Palace on the 29th for a ten-day trial. If the results are satisfactory, there may be a possibility of signing a long-term contract with the Xuan Palace authorities.

The Zhongzhong Drama Troupe, led by Wu Jingping, is about to start rehearsing. The first shot at Huada Grand Theatre is very grand. The script is still being kept secret.

This time, the New China Troupe of Lubao recruited actors, and more than 170 people applied, but only four were selected. These four are on a trial basis, with a monthly allowance of 100 yuan for transportation expenses. Another "newcomer to the drama world," Yi, has officially joined the troupe. From then on, the lineup of "New China" will become stronger.

### "Begonia" on the Silver Screen

The long novel "Begonia," which has been published in this newspaper for more than a year, tells the tragic story of a famous actor and a warlord's concubine. After reading it, Ma Xu Weibang decided to put it on the silver screen as his new work after "Cold Mountain Night Rain." A friend recently introduced him to have a meeting with the original author, Qin Shoupeng, and the opinions of both parties were very close.

"Qiuhaitang" is the stage name of a male actor who sings Qingyi roles, just like Mei Lanfang and others who sing Qingyi roles must take a more glamorous stage name. When he was studying opera in the class, he was insulted by the Chang warlord. Unexpectedly, the warlord's concubine was also a poor female student who was forced. They met by chance in an opportunity, and in the mood of "feeling the same way," they developed a relationship, which led to unpredictable consequences.

Ma Xu Weibang expressed his determination to make a film of the original work, but he will specially focus on the unfortunate experiences of students in the opera school. However, the male lead has not been decided yet, because among the young male actors in the China United Film Company, those who can hum in a shrill voice may not necessarily be suitable for the personality of Qiuhaitang. The female lead, Luo Xiangqi, is still considering Li Lihua, he said. There are some tricks that have not been forgotten by the Chinese themselves!"

However, I hope that the "Amateur Puppet Theatre" can perform more meaningful things in the future, that is the first priority!

### "If Only We Had Met Before Marriage" Premieres at the Grand Theatre on the 20th

Gao Zhanfei's first work after returning to Shanghai, "If Only We Had Met Before Marriage," will premiere at the Grand Theatre on the 20th. It has been almost five years since Lao Gao left Shanghai, and it is conceivable that Shanghai audiences are looking forward to the release of his new work.

The story of "If Only We Had Met Before Marriage" can be described as touching and tear-jerking. The four words are especially true of Zhao Xiaolan's performance of "a miserable life" by Zhong Meiling. Xu Li, Zhang Zhizhi, Yin Xiucen, Zhang Wan and others have also worked very hard.

### Brief News

The only drama publication that continues to be published is "Semi-Monthly Drama," which has been published for five years without interruption. Since the addition of "Drama Garden," the appearance has been renewed, and the quality of the single aspect is quite substantial. The new issue of Volume 4, Issue 4 was published a few days ago, and the content is even more exciting than before, with more than 20 copperplate illustrations, including the Li She ticket office, Liang Xiaoluan, Gu Zhengqiu and other commissioners, and the writers are all well-known people of the time.

### Interview with Yu Zeguang, Director of "The Primitive Man"

— Qing Jun

When I saw the news in this newspaper that "The Primitive Man" was about to be staged, it aroused my great interest. Yesterday, I went to see the puppets he made by hand. They are about three feet tall, wrapped in animal skins or leaves, and their hands and feet are mostly controlled by strings. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the hands and feet of the puppets have joints that can be used flexibly. But the other animals are one or two times larger than humans, such as the mammoth (woolly mammoth), dinosaur, and saber-toothed tiger, which are much larger than humans. Therefore, I was worried that the puppet stage must be so large that the string pullers would feel overwhelmed; or that they would not be able to turn around on stage.

After he stopped writing, I started my conversation.

"Mr. Yu, did you just start playing with this thing recently?"

"No, that was long ago, eight or nine years ago. When the International Children's Carnival was held in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the puppet show I made had already been performed at the Youth Association."

"Oh, why didn't Mr. Yu invite us to come and see it?"

"At that time, we had performed several plays such as "Wen Tianxiang" and "Lying on Firewood to Taste Gall" at the Lyceum, the Pudong Mansion Auditorium, and other places, but none of them were publicly ticketed, so the outside world was not very clear."

"Then, it looks like this time the scale must be very large?"

"Not necessarily, but the cost cannot be considered small, especially in the past month, I have almost not slept well or eaten a meal, but the excitement is really great."

"Indeed, this play - "The Primitive Man" - is full of educational meaning, but I wonder what Mr. Chu's plans are for the future?"

"After "The Primitive Man," we are preparing two plays, but I think it is better not to announce the names of these plays for the time being." Then Mr. Yu smiled and said, "Sorry."

At this point, I saw that they were all very busy, especially another producer, Mr. Li Zhenzhi, and Miss Ma Xuruo, who was arranging the music, and other workers were sweating, and I was embarrassed to delay any longer, so I had to say goodbye.

As I happily stepped out of that old school gate, I thought, "These unique

Things have not been forgotten by the Chinese themselves after all!"

However, I hope that the "Amateur Puppet Theatre" can perform more meaningful things in the future, that is the first priority!

Entertainment Anecdotes

### Dou Hui (Ritual Gathering)

— Ze Fu

In the Zhejiang area, whenever there is a funeral or a Mid-Year Festival, the family will summon Taoist priests to perform rituals involving chanting, singing, and drumming, known as Dou Hui. Its nature is quite similar to the release of flaming mouths by monks. The Yun Ji Qi Qian of Taoism says: "The Dan Yuan Star Heavenly Dou Lord is in charge of the registers of life and fortune, the upper laws of the Nine Heavens, the middle command of the departments of ghosts and gods, and the lower command of the registers of the lives of the people who study the truth." Therefore, there are secular rituals of paying homage to the Dipper to pray for blessings. The Dou in this Dou Hui should refer to the Dou Lord. However, although the monks' flaming mouth rituals also involve some drumming, chanting sutras is the main thing; this kind of Dou Hui specializes in drumming, chanting and singing, and chanting sutras is secondary. Each gathering involves a minimum of seven or eight people and a maximum of ten or more. The songs performed may be current tunes or short operas, and the content is chosen by the host. According to Fan Zushu's "Hangzhou Customs and Legacy" written during the Tongzhi period: "A singing troupe, the signboard says, 'Offering tea and banquets, paying homage to the Dipper to bless fortune.' For birthdays, they specialize in singing operas. The troupe members are proficient in eleven melodies. There are large boxes, medium boxes, and small boxes. The large and medium boxes have some decorations, with two square tables placed opposite each other at the door. The large box can accommodate eight people, the medium box can accommodate six people, and the small box can only accommodate four people." The note goes on to say: "This is what the Shaoxing people and Taoist priests do now. The people of Hangzhou do not trust them very much. Shaoxing people who reside in Hangzhou for funerals all use them." This is actually another name for Dou Hui, and it is known that it was already very popular between the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What to do?

Mrs. Ye said, "You don't need any matchmaker. Old Mrs. Chen is also a straightforward person. Ordinary old ladies wouldn't say such things." Wei Cheng said, "Yes, when I heard her words, I felt like I had taken a stimulant. I went to Shanghai in the afternoon. I first went to Gu Qizhi's residence to look for Gu Qi. When I asked, I learned that Gu Qi had returned home. I found them at their home. Gu Qi and Gu Fang were about to go out, so we met. The siblings grabbed one of my hands each and didn't let me into the house. Instead, they took me to a small restaurant for dinner. They asked me what I was doing in Shanghai. I only said, 'I missed you so much after not seeing you for so long. It snowed, and I felt as happy as Dai Kui did when he visited Shanxi. I came to Shanghai from Shuangqiao.' Gu Qi's temperament was still so bold, and Gu Fang's temperament was still so lively. I asked them what they were busy with, and they said they weren't busy with anything. There were many people eavesdropping in the small restaurant, so I didn't say anything. After dinner, I wanted to open a room in a hotel in the central area and invite them to have a long talk. They said, 'Our father is sick, and we have to go home at night and can't keep you company.' I asked what kind of illness it was, and they said, 'He has been sick for several months, sometimes better and sometimes worse. He has been wheezing badly these past few days.' When I heard them say that, I couldn't force them."

Mrs. Ye said, "That's why things often happen unexpectedly. Later, did you open a room?" Wei Cheng said, "I did. It's a joke to tell you. A Yu and I only planned to go to Shuangqiao, not to Shanghai. I felt that I didn't have enough money. When I told them that, Gu Fang took out thirty yuan for me." Mrs. Ye said, "In the future, when you go out, you must bring more money." Wei Cheng said, "Yes, but this is a rare occurrence. The next day, I called Gu Fang from the hotel. Gu Fang came alone, Gu Qi didn't come. At that time, I ignored everything and brought up the issue of marriage with Gu Fang. Aunt, guess what happened? I shouldn't have mentioned it. Even now, my face still feels hot." Mrs. Ye said, "What? Did she reject you?" Wei Cheng said, "She said, 'If you had mentioned this half a year ago, I would have agreed to you immediately, without hesitation. Now, unfortunately, it's too late. I have things that are more important than marriage." (158)
