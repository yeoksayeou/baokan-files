### North African Alamein Front: Large-Scale Tank Battle Unfolds; Germany Confident in Strong Defense; British Offensive Suffers Another Setback

Lisbon, 3rd (Domei News Agency) - The British Eighth Army on the Egyptian front launched a sudden counter-offensive in the Alamein area today. According to the Associated Press war correspondent Macmillan, the fierce battle was as follows: British tank units engaged in a fierce battle with Axis tank units in the northern Alamein area. In addition, infantry units from both sides are also engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat in the area. The British Air Force is heavily bombing Axis positions, while artillery units are also engaged in fierce combat with Axis forces with heavy artillery fire.

Lisbon, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - London officials confirmed yesterday that the long-rumored large-scale tank battle has begun on the Alamein front on the 2nd of this month. On the morning of that day, British and German tanks engaged in fierce combat all day, and the situation remained stalemated until night. The outcome of the war is still unknown in London. According to a special correspondent of Reuters stationed on the front line, it is too early to predict the outcome of the war.

Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Regarding the recent fighting in North Africa, responsible officials here stated yesterday that "the largest tank battle ever seen in Africa" is underway. Since the British army launched its offensive, it has lost one-third of its tanks, but the British army continued to attack yesterday, it is said.

Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Military sources here claim that the defensive strength of the German armored forces in North Africa is still superior to the British offensive power. The battle in Egypt has reached its climax, and the outcome should be decided in a short period of time. Axis aircraft have also stepped up their activities, it is said.

Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Responsible military officials here discussed the details of the large-scale tank battle that began on the Alamein front on the morning of the 2nd of this month, saying that although the British Eighth Army suffered heavy losses, its commander, Montgomery, continued to concentrate his forces to launch an offensive, attempting to break through Axis positions. Although the British offensive had been thwarted, fierce fighting continued yesterday. In the first nine days of the offensive, the British army suffered heavy losses, so it has now transferred troops from the central and southern routes of the Alamein front to the area for combat. After the British army broke through Axis positions south of Sidi El Rahman, the enemy launched a large-scale attack, and German and Italian artillery and aircraft met them with heavy fire, until the British tank units were exhausted. General Rommel then dispatched tanks to attack the enemy's flanks. The two sides fought desperately, step by step, with the Axis forces pressing the enemy to retreat. After a stalemate of several hours, the British army finally collapsed and retreated. Both sides suffered heavy losses in the battle, but the German-Italian coalition forces regained the upper hand that night, it is said.

Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - According to sources here, British aircraft attempted to attack a German convoy between Crete and Africa yesterday, but were intercepted by German aircraft. Despite the disparity in numbers, the German aircraft shot down four enemy aircraft and repelled the enemy aircraft, it is said.

### Record of a Japanese Navy Reporting Team Member: Details of the Battle of Savo Island

US Naval Secretary Talks About the Pacific War Situation, Advises the Public Not to Be Overly Optimistic

Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Navy achieved great results in the naval battle near Savo Island in the Solomon Islands on October 11. The battle situation at that time was recorded in detail by a member of the Japanese Navy reporting team who participated in the battle. The gist is recorded as follows: At 9:15 PM on the 11th, our cruiser fleet was speeding south under the starlight. Suddenly, a fleet of enemy ships was spotted near Savo Island in the Solomon Islands. Our ships immediately launched a surprise attack. Under the intense searchlight, the enemy fleet was seen to be in a state of chaos, completely covered by our military's artillery fire. As the distance became closer, the cannons of our ships also began to bombard fiercely. At that time, one enemy ship was hit by our torpedo again, and flames shot up immediately. Upon closer inspection, it was learned that it was an enemy 10,000-ton cruiser of the Honolulu type. After burning for a short time, the fire on the sea gradually subsided. In a moment, this huge object sank to the bottom of the sea. At that time, a small destroyer in the middle of the enemy fleet was glimpsed, gradually approaching our fleet. As our ship's cannons roared, after three shots, this enemy ship disappeared below the horizon in a blaze of fire again. At the same time, a certain ship of ours approached another enemy cruiser at maximum speed. Under the combined attack of torpedoes and cannons, the enemy ship suddenly burst into flames again. The ship first slowly sank, and then was buried in the seabed in a constant burst of explosions. At the same time, another enemy cruiser had been hit by our artillery shells and was desperately sailing south while surrounded by flames. It escaped, but it is still impossible to predict whether the ship will return to its base. In this battle, although one of our cruisers was also sacrificed, the great victory has been deeply imprinted on the turbulent waves of the South Pacific, it is said.

Lisbon, 4th (Domei News Agency) - U.S. Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox told reporters yesterday, "Regarding the war situation in the Solomon Islands, it is not appropriate to be overly optimistic. If it causes undue hope, the danger is very great. Fierce fighting is still expected. If you suffer an unexpected setback, it will inevitably cause greater disappointment. The Japanese fleet is still very strong. To say that the war has ended is not true, it is said.

### Greater East Asia Literary Conference Begins Official Meetings

Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - After holding the opening ceremony on the morning of the 3rd, the Greater East Asia Literary Conference officially began its meetings at the Greater East Asia Hall here at 10:00 AM on the 4th. Seventy-seven delegates from China, Japan, and Manchukuo attended, along with 136 attendees. The guest audience seats were particularly crowded. After announcing the opening of the meeting, Conference Chairman Masao Kume explained the composition and operation of the conference. The representatives unanimously elected Kan Kikuchi as the chairman of the meeting and Tetsutaro Kawakami as the vice-chairman. The first agenda item was the establishment of the spirit of Greater East Asia. Representatives from Japan, China, and Manchukuo, including Sanemori Mushanokoji, Yusheng Liu, Gu Ding, Daosun Qian, Ryu Saito, Baggov, and Mitsuro Kouyama, took the floor one after another, expressing their opinions enthusiastically, which won a round of applause. It was not completed until 12:40 PM. After a short lunch break, the meeting continued at 1:30 PM. The agenda item was the popularization and strengthening of the spirit of Greater East Asia.

Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Literary Conference held a formal meeting on the morning of the 4th. The first agenda item in the morning was the establishment of the spirit of Greater East Asia. Representatives from China, Japan, and Manchukuo all expressed their opinions enthusiastically. The gist is recorded separately below: Japanese representative Sanemori Mushanokoji said, "In order to achieve mutual cooperation among writers in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, I sincerely hope that they will actively rise up and strive to establish the culture of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and should study its methods." Chinese representative Yusheng Liu said, "Regarding the establishment of the East Asian spirit, my personal opinions are as follows: 1. Harmonizing the feelings between ethnic groups is the first step in establishing the East Asian spirit; 2. All East Asians should love East Asia, so we should use literary works to make everyone love each other, love their own country as the first step, love neighboring countries as the second step, and love East Asia together as the third step; 3. Adhering to morality and emphasizing benevolence and righteousness are the highest cultural goals of East Asia. Literature is the leader of thought and the guide of life. I hope that all East Asian writers will work together." Manchukuo representative Gu Ding said, "The spirit of Greater East Asia is the spirit of reviving Asia, which is also the spirit of the founding of Manchukuo. Ethnic harmony is the true meaning of the founding of Manchukuo. In order to build the spirit of Greater East Asia, we must liquidate the history of past ethnic struggles and expand the spirit of ethnic harmony to the entire Greater East Asia and the world. We who are engaged in literature must build a Greater East Asian literature of ethnic harmony." Chinese representative Daosun Qian said, "The spirit of East Asian civilization can be said to be represented by China, Japan, and India. That is, China's 'all people within the four seas are brothers', Japan's 'Hakko Ichiu', and India's 'one lotus flower'. The European and American spirit emphasizes profit, while the East Asian spirit emphasizes righteousness, so East Asia should take righteousness as its foundation and promote it to the world. Based on the original meaning of 'all people within the four seas are one family', East Asian countries should love, respect, and honor each other, and discover each other's strengths. After the European and American spirit flowed into East Asia, due to the difference between profit and righteousness, it was invisibly affected by its instigation. Today, East Asians should realize the original meaning of carrying the Tao with literature, seek the unity of East Asian culture, and spread it to the world, so that the world becomes a whole of true, beautiful, and good humanity."

Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Literary Conference continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 4th. Chinese representative Huaru Zhou and Manchukuo representative Qing Wu Ying, on the topic of the popularization and strengthening of the spirit of Greater East Asia, expressed their opinions separately. Chinese representative Huaru Zhou said, "We should promote and carry forward the inherent cultural spirit of East Asia, and at the same time liquidate the Western utilitarian thinking. If we want to strengthen the spirit of Greater East Asia, we should first pay attention to the economic life of the East Asian people and the economic prosperity of the East Asian countries. We should further promote the development of scientific and material construction to increase the well-being of all ethnic groups in East Asia. In order to promote the spirit of Greater East Asia, the East Asian nations should also work hard individually and have an organized and planned progress, so it is necessary to organize cultural institutions of the spirit of Greater East Asia to take on its tasks. The Greater East Asia Literary Conference has begun to be held and has a common goal and a common path. I firmly believe that with concerted efforts, the East Asian spirit will be strengthened and popularized." Manchukuo representative Jueqing said, "Japan is the pioneer of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The cultural spirit of Japan is worth learning from. In the future, the new culture of East Asia should also be combined with the spirit of Japan to facilitate the early completion of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Manchukuo representative Wu Ying said, "Regarding the work of establishing, strengthening, and popularizing the spirit of Greater East Asia, I will speak from the standpoint of women. As a literary worker, I should especially promote and popularize the inherent feminine virtues of the East."

Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Literary Conference continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 4th to discuss the topic of the popularization and strengthening of the spirit of Greater East Asia.

This order is issued by Chairman Wang Zhaoming and President Wen Zongyao of the Judicial Yuan.

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - The original report of the Military Affairs Committee's trial of Yang Zhonghua is transcribed below: According to the report of Liu Dufen, the chief judge of the High Military Law Court of the Army, and judges Bao Wenyue, Xiao Shuxuan, Da-yi Ying, and Xixian Zhang, etc., the undersigned, having been instructed to try the case of Yang Zhonghua, the dismissed commander-in-chief of the Second Group Army, for violating laws and regulations, have completed several trials and have decided to sentence Yang Zhonghua to five years of imprisonment for illegally collecting donations, three years of imprisonment for embezzling funds, and a combined execution of five years and six months of imprisonment.

### Contribution of Several Opinions on the Youth Movement - Broadcast Speech by Minister of Propaganda Lin

Fellow compatriots, fellow youths, this mission to Japan, in addition to attending the East Asia Roundtable Conference, has the main task of studying the organization and training of young people in friendly nations. I departed at the end of September, passed through Beijing in October, and returned to the capital, spending a month in total. The time spent inspecting various parts of Japan was a total of three weeks. Regarding the organization and training of young men and women, school youth, vocational youth, factory youth, rural youth, and army, navy, and air force youth in friendly nations, there are truly too many things seen and heard in terms of spirit and technique that are worthy of emulation. I am currently organizing materials with my colleagues, intending to write an inspection report in the near future to contribute to the government and the youth of the entire country. Today, I would like to present a few points that are most noteworthy in the spirit of this inspection of the organization and training of youth in friendly nations to provide a brief report to everyone.

First, the efforts of the leaders of youth groups in friendly nations are entirely for the purpose of training young people and cultivating strength for the country, and absolutely not for establishing personal power. Everyone only knows how to contribute everything for the country and for East Asia. The national strength of friendly nations is flourishing and has reached its current state, which is by no means accidental. Our China has had a youth movement for a long time, not just since today. The youth movement occupies a very important position in the National Revolution. Since the revolution, the efforts and spirit of sacrifice of young comrades are truly admirable. However, in the development of the youth movement over the past two decades, there has been a major shortcoming that we should deeply reflect on and correct. Many people engaged in the youth movement always use the youth movement as a personal tool, placing young people in their personal pockets, using the patriotic spirit of young people, using the enthusiasm of young people to participate in the revolution, to create personal positions. Once the goal has been achieved, they abandon young people, or even trample on them. For more than twenty years, various political movements have been rife with small organizations, and the political situation has been turbulent, so that young people started with sincerity, then diverged in opinions, and finally became depressed and bewildered. It can be said that all of this is born from this. Today, we are in a serious situation of life and death, and we can no longer allow the use of young people to establish personal power. We should do our best, unite sincerely, train young people, and cultivate strength to dedicate it to the leader, to the party, to the country, to East Asia. The spirit of the leaders of youth groups in friendly nations to contribute strength to the country and to East Asia is worthy of us taking as an example. If the New National Movement wants to eliminate individualism in organization and training, it must start with the leaders themselves. I should first reflect on myself and encourage all youth leaders in the country to do the same. Second, the people of friendly nations, men, women, old and young, all have a kind of serious and solemn sincerity. No matter what they do, they are absolutely not perfunctory or irresponsible. One day, just when the American air raid conspiracy was announced, we went out early in the morning to visit, and along the way, we saw personnel engaged in air raid drills. Regardless of men or women, wearing air raid clothing and hats, some were stationed, some were practicing, until late at night it was still the same. Almost the entire city of Tokyo was mobilized to engage in air raid drills. The restaurants and entertainment venues were the same. They were not perfunctory at all, but serious and solemn. A few days later, we visited female university students and participated in air raid drills. That day, it was raining heavily. The school authorities sought the opinions of the students, and they said that there would be air raids even when it rained, so naturally they had to practice. As a result, they did it faithfully according to the planned plan. The lifelike situation, teams of firefighters, poison gas teams, and casualty teams, in the pouring rain, were like fighting in a hail of bullets. They were not perfunctory at all, but very serious and very solemn. This spirit of the people of friendly nations can be seen anytime and anywhere. I am just giving one example now. Thinking back over the past five or six years, whether in actual air raids or in hypothetical drills, only a very few people who could not but be responsible were working hard. Most people either stood by and watched or fled in panic. Alas, we are born here, and we will die here. Where can we escape to? If we ourselves are not seriously responsible, who will be responsible? This is another point that I should reflect on and take as an example.

Third, the organization and training of young people in friendly nations are aimed at winning the war and postwar construction, with national defense training as the warp and diligent service as the weft. They are able to comprehensively consider the situation in various places, the jobs of individuals, and their work abilities. For school youth, they are not told to abandon their studies and only know how to put up slogans and shout slogans. Instead, in the organization and training, they supplement the efficiency of education, give play to the instincts of young people, and train the students' bodies and minds, so that they can be more upward and more effective for the country and society. For factory youth, they are not told to leave their posts without permission and only know how to hold meetings and clamor, and engage in intrigue to increase labor-management disputes. Instead, in the organization and training, they are given spiritual education and technical training, so that they can better coordinate labor and management and increase production, which is to increase the strength of the country. It is the same for rural youth. Which place needs to be reclaimed, which river needs to be dredged, they mobilize according to actual needs. Young people participate in labor. Also, during the busy farming season, teams of young ladies from the city go to the countryside to take care of children for the farmers, cook food, and every task has practical needs, achieving practical results. It is beneficial to young people, beneficial to the countryside, and beneficial to the country. It is definitely not like us, telling young students to sweep the streets and plant trees, just to do propaganda.

What has been said above is just what I have observed, regarding the excellent spirit of the youth movement in friendly nations, which is precisely what China urgently needs. I have specially pointed out two or three points to report to compatriots across the country. As for the specific issues of organization and training, because our national systems and national conditions are not entirely the same, we carefully examined them with the two principles of "seeing the similarities in the differences and seeing the differences in the similarities, taking the strengths of others to make up for our own shortcomings." I feel that the places that can be used for reference cannot be summarized in a few simple words. I can only leave it to a written report.

Finally, there is one more point that I want to solemnly report. During this inspection, under the wartime system, we saw that the social organization of friendly nations is more rigorous, the essence of economic strength is more solid, and the national spirit is more vibrant. I know that the Greater East Asia War not only has the belief of certain victory, but also the conviction of certain victory. What is especially worthy of our admiration is the highest degree and purest patriotism of men, women, old and young throughout the country. From this, we have a deeper understanding of the enthusiasm and sincerity of young people in friendly nations towards China. Only with this highest degree of patriotism can they dedicate everything to the country, so they can be serious and solemn in everything, so they can endure hardship and be brave and diligent. Only with this pure patriotism can they expand their patriotism and love East Asia, so they can extend what they love to others. Although our two countries have experienced grievous changes in the past few decades, there has always been a symphony of the purest hearts in the depths of the hearts of young people in both countries. This is entirely due to the purest feelings of loving the country and loving East Asia. In the short period of three weeks, no matter what the occasion, the enthusiasm and sincerity of young people in friendly nations towards us really moved us too much. This enthusiasm and sincerity is not towards me personally, but towards China, towards Chinese youth, towards Chinese youth who love China, love Japan, and love East Asia. We are confident that due to the symphony of the hearts of young people in the two countries, young people in the two countries will be able to unite and build into teams of iron troops to defend East Asia. It can be asserted that the youth of friendly nations have taken big steps on the road to defending East Asia. How should we work hard to move forward? This is what we should deeply encourage ourselves. I have nothing else to say today. I am willing to follow the youth of the country and further strengthen my determination and efforts to promote the New National Movement. I sincerely wish the youth of China to unite and create a youth China, and wish the youth of East Asia to unite and create a youth East Asia.

As for the battle to defend the port of Dakar in the future, it will definitely not be the so-called 'war of honor,' because the glory of France has not wavered.

### Notification from Edible Oil Wholesale Department - Selling Off All Stocked Oil - Applying for Transportation and Movement Certificates

Hundreds of Oil Merchants Suspend Distribution Due to Price Increases

Recently, due to hoarding by some merchants, there has been unrest regarding edible oil in the city. The trade association wholesale department specifically stated: (1) The current amount of oil in the city is still very sufficient, and there is no need to worry about a shortage in the foreseeable future. (2) Currently, the production of Shanghai oil factories is approximately 1,000 dan per day, which is more than enough to meet the daily needs of Shanghai. Even if the operating rate of oil factories decreases in the future due to the inability to transport raw materials from all sources, the existing oil can also be used to compensate. (3) Several factories in Pudong and Puxi already exist, and in addition to supplying local needs, a portion can also be transported into the city. Therefore, the supply and demand situation of edible oil in the city should ease in the future. As for the black market for edible oil, it is created by profiteers. The department has conducted a thorough investigation and will thoroughly crack down on it. It has been confirmed that the retail stores that have raised prices have been stopped from distributing oil. There are two or three hundred of them. Therefore, there are currently more than 1,800 stores that are distributing edible oil.

Notification

The Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Association Wholesale Department issued a notification to all edible oil retail stores yesterday, saying, "As above, this office has learned that the supply organizations for the edible oil needed in the Shanghai area are military distribution organizations. As for this office, it is only responsible for distribution. When it was established, this office applied for a monthly need of edible oil to be set at 40,000 dan, and at least 30,000 dan. However, in the past nine months, the monthly supply has only been about 20,000 dan. After a separate allocation to the wine and food industries, only about 17,000 dan can be distributed to various guilds. If we divide this number equally among 2,000 members, each member will receive 8 dan and 50 jin per month. It is not surprising that this number is not enough to meet sales. However, according to the principle of allocating materials, the number of members cannot be used as a unit, and it must be based on the past historical business situation and the amount of registration applied for to determine the amount of allocation. Therefore, the amount of allocation for smaller member retail stores will naturally be even less. Therefore, in terms of the number of members and the past supply of edible oil, this is the real reason why this office has had difficulty in fulfilling members' requests to increase the amount of oil or apply to join the oil distribution. Now that the winter season is approaching and oil sales are stronger, this wholesale department is well aware of the situation and has repeatedly requested the authorities to increase the amount. However, for various reasons, this wish has not been fulfilled. Recently, it has not been possible to apply for transportation and movement certificates for oil transportation due to changes in the competent authorities.

This office is now requesting the authorities to find a way to deal with the aftermath to maintain the situation. Once approved, a notification will be issued again. As for the oil in stock of your members, you should sell it all off as soon as possible to meet the needs of the citizens. Please do not hoard it, lest the authorities find out and impose penalties. This is to inform you, I hope you will take note of it."

### Factories Start Buying Raw Wheat

Limited Price of 180 Yuan Per Dan

After the China Communications Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai-Central Bank, and other banks agreed to lend money to Fuxin, Zaofeng, and other flour mills to purchase raw wheat from various places, the factories have all obtained permission from the Japanese authorities. Under the control of the China Central Flour Milling Association, they purchased raw wheat from Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other producing areas. It is said that the authorities have set a limited price of 180 yuan per dan in Central Reserve Certificates for raw wheat. They are trying to transport the wheat collected to Shanghai to start manufacturing flour. As for the flour mills of Japanese merchants, they have purchased wheat from Zhenjiang, Qingpu, and other places with loans from Japanese banks. A joint entity organized by 26 Japanese merchants is preparing to strictly control the work of purchasing raw wheat in the Wuhu area.

### New Measures Will Be Formulated for Sugar Supply

Half of the Crowds Rushing to Buy Resell at High Prices - Thoroughly Eliminating Behind-the-Scenes Operations to Restore the Situation

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that a certain official of the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office met with reporters this morning (4th) and stated emphatically that there is absolutely no problem with the sugar supply, and the sugar in stock at the cooperative business office is sufficient for the needs of this year and next year.

Eliminating Speculation and Fair Distribution

The office is currently drafting measures for the fair distribution of sugar and the elimination of illegal speculators, and has recently issued additional regulations regarding the retail of sugar in order to reduce black market activities and prevent hoarding and speculation. After these regulations are put into effect, special supervisors will be sent to supervise the prices and quantities of sugar sold by registered retailers. The sugar situation in this city has not yet recovered, but the office's efforts to crack down on black market activities have achieved satisfactory results.

The Sugar in Stock Can Last for More Than a Year

The existing sugar in stock is quite sufficient, not only sufficient for this year's use, but also for next year and beyond. What's more, the source of sugar has been opened, and there is no possibility of a shortage. Therefore, residents do not need to alarm each other and should not rush to buy sugar. According to the office's investigation, half of the crowds rushing to buy sugar at retail stores are doing so for the purpose of reselling it at high prices. Therefore, it is stipulated that sugar can only be purchased with a citizen's card, which is aimed at preventing illegal profiteers from reselling it at high prices or transporting it to other areas. Regarding the restoration of the normal state of sugar supply here, the office has studied ways to ensure fair distribution and has drafted a plan that will be submitted to the authorities for final consideration and approval. The official stated at the end that there is absolutely no shortage of sugar supply in Shanghai. The unfortunate situation that exists at present is all caused by unfounded rumors. The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is doing its best to remedy the situation and bring it back on track.

### Clearing of Trust Deposits - First Refund Yesterday

The Shanghai branch of the Central Trust Bureau, located at 592 Foch Road, 2nd Floor, which is being liquidated, began to refund the first deposit at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (4th). The amount refunded per household was 1,000 yuan, and the funds paid by the same industry from December 9, 1941, to September 13, 1942, were included. Those with deposits of more than 5,000 yuan must indicate that they are not hostile before they can be paid. It is said that yesterday (4th), many depositors went to withdraw their deposits enthusiastically.

### Inaugural Meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League

The Indians in Shanghai, with the Indian Independence League headquarters in Bangkok, are fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland. They deeply feel that the Indian compatriots in this city also need to rise up and respond. Therefore, they proceeded with preparatory work. Six Indian groups in the city jointly organized the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League. The preparations have now been completed, and the inaugural meeting was held at the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road from 2:00 p.m. on the 2nd. More than 1,000 representatives from various factions and Indians from all walks of life participated. The list of executive personnel is as follows: Branch Director: Chittarsing; Committee Members: Madan Baja, Harona Sing, Bobby Satla, Ramon Dowan.

### Speculators Released on Bail Violate Promise to Await Summons

Twelve Brokers Will Be Summoned to Explain Reasons

It is learned that speculators who were arrested for engaging in black market activities from July 25 to September 30 were released on bail at their request on October 29. However, these people did not appear in court for trial on the previous (3rd) court date. Therefore, the parties concerned will summon the 12 brokers who were released on bail again within two weeks to explain the reason for their failure to appear in court. It is said that they expressed considerable surprise at the failure of these 12 brokers to keep their promise to appear in court for retrial. Therefore, they hope to obtain the reasons for their failure to appear in court at the next interrogation and expect the rest of those arrested to also appear in court. Looking back at the arrests of speculators in September, only 12 representatives from various firms were summoned to court. Most of the firm representatives admitted their guilt and expressed their obedience to the notification issued by the Public Works Department regarding the prohibition of speculation. From then on, they will no longer engage in black market activities, and the Huo Nuoqian Company has changed its business to the trading of stock certificates and goods pledges. It is stipulated that a profit of 10 yuan will be drawn for every 10,000 yuan of bonds. Before July 25, the company engaged in speculation and made a profit of 2 yuan for every package of cotton cloth sold. It is also learned that because reports of rampant black market activity in this port have been received, the police are continuing to investigate and make arrests.

### Statement by Japanese Ambassador to Shanghai, Mr. Tajiri

Mr. Tajiri Aiyi, the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 3rd. On the morning of the 4th, at 10:30 AM, he met with reporters for the first time on the sixth floor of the Broadway Mansions, stating: "The Japanese government has newly established the Greater East Asia Ministry, and the local organizations in China and their operations are being consolidated in a unified manner. A new embassy office has been established in Shanghai, and I have been entrusted with this significant responsibility. The scope of affairs of the Shanghai Embassy Office will broadly cover political, economic, and cultural matters in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. We intend to closely coordinate and cooperate with the command headquarters to carry out the affairs under our jurisdiction. Shanghai and its surrounding areas are quite important in terms of the position and development of the National Government. It is also important in terms of constructing Greater East Asia and completing the Greater East Asia War. Our responsibility is to further develop this position and increase its value beyond what it is today. We should consider that the Greater East Asia War is a war that progresses in conjunction with construction. Looking back at history, past wars ended due to exhaustion, and construction began afterward. But today is different. We are engaging in construction while fighting the war. This is a characteristic of the Greater East Asia War. Although the phrase 'war and construction progress in conjunction' is simple, it contains a very significant meaning. This point should be deeply recognized. After a deep understanding, a new awareness will emerge. The idea of construction while fighting the war is to cultivate combat power, which is an indispensable necessity and a major task of the embassy office. As for the National Government of the Republic of China, construction in the political, economic, and cultural aspects is necessary to establish friendly relations between the people of China and Japan. Therefore, broadly speaking, the people of China and Japan, centered on Shanghai, should, in the Yangtze River area, respond to military demands with mutual trust and harmonious cooperation to complete the war. At the same time, we should strive to make the people of both countries respect each other and foster harmonious feelings to establish friendly relations. If this construction is successful, a new order based on the spirit of benevolence and righteousness can be established in East Asia. If there are still remnants of British and American influence in East Asia, they will surely be eliminated. Furthermore, although people from Japan's allied countries are active in various places, they must deeply recognize the situation and cooperate with Japan to achieve construction. In short, the construction of Greater East Asia is a very important undertaking that must be carried out step by step. I hold a firm will and hope that all overseas Chinese and gentlemen of the Republic of China will have a deep understanding, share the responsibility of cooperation and construction in Greater East Asia, and provide continued cooperation and guidance in the future."

Address to Subordinates

(Our Correspondent in Shanghai) The newly appointed Ambassador to Shanghai, Tajiri Aiyi, delivered his first address to over 600 embassy officials yesterday morning (Wednesday), pointing out that closer cooperation among all officials is essential for the Shanghai Embassy to operate smoothly. He said, "We have colleagues from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the East Asia Bureau, but from now on, we will be working together in the Greater East Asia Ministry, and we should strive to enhance cooperation." He recalled the speech given by Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry in Tokyo, hoping for cooperation among colleagues, simplification of procedures, and regularization of official regulations. Therefore, Tajiri urged the embassy officials here to set an example not only for the Japanese in Shanghai but also for the people of third countries. In the afternoon, Tajiri, accompanied by the newly appointed Minister to Nanjing, Horiuchi Kaneki, visited the Shanghai Shrine and various Japanese organizations.

Talk by Japanese Consul General

Mr. Yano Seiki, the newly appointed Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, arrived on the evening of the 3rd. At 4:30 PM on the 4th, he met with a group of reporters for the first time in the Consul General's office at the Consulate General, and gave a brief statement: "I am deeply honored to be appointed as the Consul General of Shanghai, despite my humble abilities. At the same time, I deeply feel that the responsibility is extremely heavy and great. All previous Consuls General in Shanghai have been capable and efficient individuals. I am deeply apprehensive about being appointed as the first Consul General after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of last year, the situation has taken a sharp turn. This time, in order to achieve the goals of the war, the government has established the Greater East Asia Ministry. The mission of this Consulate General is to respond to this new situation, to work together with the Japanese in Shanghai, and to join hands with Chinese people to strengthen the rear defenses and echo the brilliant achievements of the soldiers on the front lines, with the aim of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I will also devote all my efforts to fulfill my responsibilities. I hope that the Japanese people in Shanghai will continue to support the Consulate General and provide cooperation."

### Vita-Fu Cup Volleyball Charity Match, Soviet Team Corrects Competition Name

The Vita-Fu Cup China-Russia volleyball charity match has concluded. Yesterday, the captain of the Soviet team, Mr. Mi Weiguv, stated in a letter that the team did not participate in the competition and should be corrected. Upon investigation, the "Soviet" in the Vita-Fu Cup China-"Soviet" volleyball charity match was actually a mistake for "Russia." The team that competed against Xingren was Russian expatriates, not the Soviet team. Therefore, the name of the China-Soviet charity match seems inappropriate.

### Sunset at an Ancient Temple

The Tuberculosis Prevention Society's photography exhibition opens today, featuring many exquisite works. The light and angles of this frame are extremely beautiful.

### A Tour of the Six Major Libraries, Rich in Collections (Part 4)

The time for borrowing books from the library is limited to weekdays; there is no borrowing on Sundays. The opening hours of Xin Ya are from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. During the summer, there is no break at noon, and the library closes at 2:00 PM. Zhen Dan's borrowing hours start at 8:30 AM and 3:00 PM, each lasting for two hours. The Public Concession Library is open for borrowing as soon as it opens.

Because there are many people borrowing books at Xin Ya, it is not easy to borrow them. You have to request many books each time to borrow one or two. Popular books, such as Ba Jin's novels, postal books during the postal examination period, and current insurance books, are extremely difficult to borrow. Often, you request many and still can't borrow one. When borrowing books elsewhere, you have to write a slip of paper for each book, which the library uses as proof. You can select books yourself in the stacks of the Public Concession Library. If you don't know how to select, you can ask for a card, check the number and author in the catalog, write them on the card, write your address and name on the back, and drop it into the card box. If the book is available, it will be mailed to you in two or three days; then you can go to pick it up. Xin Ya also has this procedure, but it is limited to pre-ordering books that are difficult to borrow.

An ordinary library card can borrow two books. Xin Ya limits it to one. The Public Concession Library has three, but students can only borrow two. Xin Ya only lends books for one week, the Public Concession Library and Ming Fu for one week, and Zhen Dan for one month. They must be returned by the deadline, otherwise a fine will be charged. Xin Ya charges five cents per day, and other places charge ten cents. If you want to continue reading, you can bring the book to the library to renew it. The renewal period is the same as the borrowing period. Some thick books at Xin Ya are automatically renewed for one to three weeks, but even with so much time, you still can't finish reading them, and the renewal period is still only one week.

Borrowed books should naturally be cherished. Many readers like to criticize, scold, or complain in books, which is really meaningless. Some people tear out good pages when they see them, and even want to misappropriate things from the library for their own benefit if there is a profit to be made. The books in the Xin Ya library that are not from major bookstores such as Commercial Press and Zhonghua Bookstore are often not priced at the original price, and these books are mostly out of print and very valuable, so I would like to suggest that the library pay more attention to them. In my opinion, the value of a book lies in its soul, not its body. If you understand the main points of the book clearly, the body of the book will be useless to you. On the contrary, those who are meticulous about the body of the book must be people who are unwilling to read books. Although the body of the book is in your hands, the soul of the book still does not belong to you.

Further Discussion

The current publishing industry is very lonely and depressing, which reduces the courage of book readers a lot. The most common are two views. Some conservatives think that rice prices are expensive and they can't even afford to eat, so they can't do anything about it, so why buy books? Another group of very new people think that there are no new magazines, so why read books?

Regarding the first question, I think buying books is good, but borrowing books is not necessarily bad. The value of a book is the value of the soul of the book, not the value of the body of the book. Therefore, the more seriously you read, the faster the value of the body is lost; the more you read, the more the value of the body is lost. From this point of view, borrowing books is more cost-effective than buying books. If you like to read outside and are greedy for comfort, then it is not impossible to borrow books to your home. Ordinary books in the library can be borrowed, and more specialized books can be read in the library, which is sometimes more focused than at home, and can achieve greater results.

Regarding the second question, I don't think anyone can completely read the old books, so new books are very necessary, but old books cannot be lacking. All new ideas and academics cannot emerge out of thin air; they all evolve and emerge from older ideas and academics. If we trace back from the present, we will definitely find its origins. This will definitely be very helpful for the effect of reading. Moreover, since all new things are based on the old, then understanding more about the old means being able to absorb more of the new. Therefore, reading older books is not necessarily useless. This is not only an expedient measure when there are no new books, but also an effort that should be made when there are new books.

### Public Debt Sellers Flood the Market, Price Falls Further

The gray market price of public bonds fell further yesterday. There was a flood of consistent sellers, and the market price fell by two yuan. After a brief pause in the middle, the market rebounded. Later, powerful major holders suddenly flooded the market with sales, and the price fell again. Generally speaking, major holders were looking for a way out, and consistent sellers still had goods to deliver. Yesterday, the northern gang's buying appetite was stronger, but it was ultimately overwhelmed by the outflow from major holders. This situation is because the news has not yet been officially released, and is still in a state of secrecy. Yesterday, Class C started low by about 1.5 yuan, and then fell another yuan. Sellers stopped in the middle, and retail investors and the northern gang absorbed the supply. Suddenly, it rebounded by 2.5 yuan. Near the close, powerful major holders suddenly flooded the market with sales again, and the price fell another 1.5 yuan.

### The Spirit of Sacrifice

— Gao Jiaji

That night, it was already past ten o'clock when suddenly I heard loud siren wails outside. I ran to the window to see what was happening and saw people running northwards. Then, looking up, I saw thick smoke billowing behind the houses across the street, flames reaching the sky, and sparks flying everywhere. It turned out that the low houses in front were on fire.

Soon, fire trucks came rushing in, and the firefighters began to work busily, and the situation suddenly became tense. Because the front was crowded with people and the patrol police were deployed to maintain order, we could not get close to the disaster area and could only watch the fire from a distance.

Six or seven-year-old children, holding the quilts they had just warmed in their sleep, fled from the disaster area. Mothers held their children, some taking rickshaws to carry their luggage, in a state of panic and misery. This continued until late at night before the fire was finally extinguished. But already, several thousand people were homeless and had to spend the night under the open sky.

The next morning, I went to the disaster area to see the aftermath. About five or six hundred houses had been burned to the ground, including one or two small factories. The beams and pillars were charred, and the bricks and tiles were blackened. Remnants of wheels, machine parts, water pipes, and boilers were scattered all over the ground. The victims, supporting the old and carrying the young, were digging through the ashes, hoping against hope to salvage some of their lost belongings.

In the disaster area, I suddenly discovered a row of houses that had been half-demolished. The contents of the upper and lower floors were clearly visible. To the south of this row of houses, everything was burned to the ground, while to the north of this row, everything was intact. Undoubtedly, this was part of the work done by the firefighters last night. This row of houses was sacrificed to protect the other houses.

There are many times when we too should have this spirit of decisively demolishing a house as a sacrifice. In order to protect the people we love, and their lives and property, and to avoid mutual destruction, we should sometimes sacrifice money, sacrifice our careers, sacrifice our positions, sacrifice our generous incomes, sacrifice our material pleasures, and even sacrifice our own lives.

Such a spirit of sacrifice, which Buddhists call "giving," is great.

### The Mediators of Goods

— Kai Zhi

(3) Hard-Earned Money is Spent Happily

Brokers often have little contact with each other and do not adhere to the ethics that brokers should follow. For example, if you are doing business and they find out, they will secretly try to "steal the root," "dump the plate," using any means to snatch your business. So, fights and tea talks often occur.

They also have many unexpected tricks. In the past, when prices were rising, if you bought a certain kind of goods from them in the morning, specifying that they would be delivered in the afternoon or the next day, but the price suddenly rose sharply after you bought them, you might not receive the goods when you sent the money to pick them up – they had already sold the goods you had bought to a third party at a higher price. This is probably what is meant by the methods of gods and tigers. Naturally, if you ask them to deliver the goods, they will just prevaricate, and no matter how much you scold them, they will respond with a smile, leaving you with no way to deal with them.

However, such things do not happen to people who value "face" and keep their word. But on the other hand, both the buyer and the seller sometimes break their promises, such as the seller reneging after selling, or the buyer not picking up the goods after buying, which forces the brokers to "square accounts."

There is a kind of broker who does not pay much attention to the commission they deserve. They are too lazy to do business, so what do they do? They "catch Amaos" and "wear hats." "Catching Amaos" and "wearing hats" means secretly adding a "plate" to the price offered by the seller. Only experienced old brokers can do this skillfully; otherwise, they will inevitably reveal their true colors. If the transaction is successful, earning hundreds or thousands of dollars is nothing. With such income, they can have more money. But it is easy come, easy go. As soon as the commission is in hand, they either run to the dance hall, watch movies, go to restaurants, or rent rooms, play mahjong, play with women, and spend money recklessly. There are also many business-related social engagements, such as someone in a company "making a big deal," the boss celebrating a major event, or the young master celebrating a full moon, all of which require them to socialize, and they cannot simply give a small gift, because these are their "bread and butter."

Therefore, nine out of ten runners and brokers cannot save money. They have this saying: "If you don't spend it, it won't come; hard-earned money is spent happily." Now that the trend of hoarding has subsided, and business in various industries is very quiet, they have nothing to do, no income, and they are used to eating and spending, and they still have to attend social engagements, so they feel very depressed, and you can see them gradually heading towards decline.

### The Road

— Jie Ren

There are two roads in the world; one is a flat road with flowers blooming, and the other is a rugged road piled with rocks. Ordinary people who are new to society, especially our young people, will feel confused when looking at these two roads. Many people go to the flat and comfortable road, and no one walks the rugged road. In fact, this road can best temper our blood and energy and enable us to become capable people. Since ancient times, the great successful people in various countries of the world have succeeded because they chose to walk this rugged road!

Walking in the dark is difficult and lonely, and requires a light. However, darkness is only a transient illusion; only after tasting bitterness can there be happiness, and the happiness after bitterness is sweet and great; and only after walking through the darkness will you encounter the magnificent colors of the sky. The person who advises you is the bright light, which can lead you to the road to success.

A famous navigator would say, "In the turbulent sea, the most important thing is to rely on your own judgment. If you hesitate, it is tantamount to suicide." The road is long, but walking can overcome its length! Only fools are afraid to walk on dangerous roads, so don't stop your progress because of the ruggedness of the road! On the road of life, there are storms, darkness, and dangerous mountain paths.

Go! Friends! Let's flatten the ruggedness of the world and use the power of the masses to open up the path of righteousness! Create a bright path from the darkness!

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Who does Cheng Bing resemble? He somewhat resembles Chen Guoqi, and also somewhat resembles Chen Guofang. This is Wei Cheng's new discovery. Chen Guoqi and Chen Guofang are siblings from the same parents. If he resembles Chen Guoqi, he will naturally resemble Chen Guofang, but how could this Cheng Bing resemble Chen Guoqi? As time passed, Wei Cheng transformed his anger into deep thought. Sitting in his chair, he furrowed his brows, looked up, looked down, supported his chin with his hands, and then supported the back of his head, closing his eyes to think about what kind of person Chen Guoqi was, and what kind of person this murderous demon was. While thinking, he suddenly let out a strange cry and slapped his thigh with his right hand. This strange cry elicited a loud laugh from outside Shuangmei Shuwu. Huang Long laughed loudly outside and then yanked open the door and barged in, saying, "So you were here. I was wondering where you had gone. At first, I thought, I couldn't find you or Sister Cuizhen. You two were whispering secrets somewhere. I was wrong, you were here. Is Sister Cuizhen inside? Don't be so upright in front of people, but behind their backs, you call each other 'sister' and 'brother' so enthusiastically, hahaha."

When Wei Cheng heard that it was Huang Long, he quickly rushed to the table, stuffed Cheng Bing's photo into his pocket, and pretended that nothing had happened. Seeing Huang Long swaying in drunk, saying many nonsensical words, he said, "Don't talk nonsense, I'm alone in the room. You see, I wanted to take down the portraits of my late parents, but I accidentally broke the frame. What should I do?" Huang Long said, "Broke it? Where is it? Oh, on this table, right?" He took a look, one was a photo of Mrs. Ye Da, and the other, he turned it over, but when he turned it, the broken glass fell to the ground and on the table. Huang Long spread his hands and stuck out his tongue, saying, "You didn't break it, I broke it. What's wrong, this glass is old and useless, it breaks as soon as you touch it." He hurriedly picked up the broken glass from the ground and put it back in the frame. Wei Cheng said, "It's broken, what's the use?" Huang Long clapped his hands and said, "I remember, there's a frame like this in the east room, I'll go get it. Who is this, is this your father? Ah, sorry, sorry, if he were alive, I would definitely be scolded by him." (221)
