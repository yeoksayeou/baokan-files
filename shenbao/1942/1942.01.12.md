### Intense Fighting Unfolds in Malaya; Japanese Troops Advance to the Outskirts of Kuala Lumpur

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency Dispatch) – News has arrived from London, Berlin, and Shanghai that Japanese troops occupied Kuala Lumpur last night. However, as of late tonight, this has not been confirmed by the Japanese General Headquarters. Recent military dispatches from the front lines indicate that Japanese troops today launched a fierce attack on the British defense line, which stretches for ten kilometers from east to west, north of Kuala Lumpur. One unit of the Japanese army had already reached the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur by noon. Japanese aircraft also bombed the city, setting military targets ablaze. An official announcement from Tokyo stated that the Japanese vanguard, with close cooperation from aircraft, launched a major flanking attack on Kuala Lumpur, reaching Molek (45 kilometers southwest of Kuala Lumpur) and Klang (25 kilometers west of Kuala Lumpur). Japanese aircraft destroyed 23 British trucks and 7 tanks in a certain area north of Kuala Lumpur, and also destroyed two trains fully loaded with soldiers in the area of Kajang, 11 kilometers southeast of Kuala Lumpur.

Furthermore, a telegram from the Malayan front reports that British forces have abandoned the defense of Kuala Lumpur. Previous expectations that Japanese forces would launch a direct attack from the north did not materialize. The elite Japanese troops, after occupying an important British airfield approximately kilometers southwest of Kuala Lumpur, immediately launched their first attack on the city from the southwest.

Singapore, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) – The British Far East Command announced this morning, stating that there were no changes to report in the Malayan front situation today. Japanese aircraft attacked targets within Malaya yesterday, and the Pontian railway was bombed, damaging the tracks. Muar was also attacked this morning, but detailed reports of casualties and damage have not yet been received. An alert was issued in Singapore this morning, but no bombs were dropped. British aircraft from the Far East Command engaged in patrol and reconnaissance activities throughout yesterday.

Xi'an, 11th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) – According to news received here today, Singapore is preparing to be besieged. The Japanese troops, undeterred by the heat of the tropical jungle or the rugged terrain, have now occupied Kuala Lumpur, the second largest city in Malaya and the capital of Selangor, and are pursuing the retreating British forces. All docks, warehouses, and military camps in Singapore have been equipped with machine guns and small artillery. Some areas are off-limits to the public, and after sunset, the entire city is as silent as death, with everyone locked in their homes. Currently, the British military authorities are quite busy dealing with the large numbers of people fleeing from the north into Singapore. The food supply problem is already very serious, and all rice stored at the evening twilight has been confiscated and transported to Singapore. According to American sources, the fall of Kuala Lumpur has caused great confusion in the British lines in Malaya. In some war zones, ranging from twenty to fifty kilometers deep, fierce hand-to-hand combat has occurred. The Japanese army's unconventional tactics have left the British at a loss.

London, 11th (Reuters) – According to military observers, fierce fighting is taking place between British and Japanese forces in central Malaya. From that area southwards to the Bernam and Slim Rivers, the British forces are holding the peninsula's strongest natural defenses. The area is characterized by numerous springs and dense jungles, with undulating mountains and narrow defense lines. The artillery can inflict severe blows on the attackers. However, Japanese troops are arriving continuously, wave after wave. If the defending forces are not reinforced, it may be difficult to hold the line under such intense pressure, as the Japanese are able to continually bring in reinforcements. The defending forces are outnumbered and their strength is waning. Thus, the Japanese forces are constantly launching converging attacks from multiple directions, making defense difficult. According to units retreating from the front lines, they are simultaneously threatened from five or six directions, with bullets flying all around. The front lines desperately need more aircraft.

British Forces Implement Scorched Earth Policy

Singapore, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) – A traveler from Kuala Lumpur claimed yesterday, the 11th, that Selangor is now implementing a scorched earth policy.

Similarly, tin mines have been flooded and the stored rubber has been burned.

Singapore, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) – General Percival, commander of British forces in Malaya, broadcast from Singapore yesterday, stating briefly that the British are determined to defend Singapore. Britain's mission is to ward off Japan's first blow. Singapore is an area the Allied nations have decided to defend. Percival also warned that Singapore will suffer even more severe air raids than experienced so far.

Tokyo, 11th (Domei News Agency Dispatch) – British and American newspapers speculate that Allied forces are now preparing to attack Japan from Burma, and the fact that American lend-lease supplies to Chongqing will be rerouted to Rangoon at the end of January serves as evidence for this plan.

### Japanese Troops Continuously Reinforced; Philippine Battle Situation Chaotic; American and Filipino Forces Defend Bataan Peninsula Relying on Perilous Terrain

Washington, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) – A War Department communiqué last night stated that on Luzon Island in the Philippines, only skirmishes and artillery fire occurred throughout the day last Friday. Japanese reinforcements are still arriving continuously. Japanese aircraft are limited to reconnaissance. Several Japanese ships appeared again near the coast of Mindanao Island last Friday.

Lisbon, 10th (Telegraph Dispatch) – According to a telegraph dispatch from Washington, the battle line is now unfolding in the southwest of Pampanga, near the neck of the Bataan Peninsula, stretching for fifty to sixty kilometers. The American and Filipino forces are showing signs of being forced to retreat. A statement released by the U.S. War Department also acknowledges that the battle situation is chaotic, stating that it is unclear whether the ports of Subic and Olongapo in Subic Bay, located between the Bataan Peninsula and Zambales province on the southwest coast of the Philippines, are still in the hands of American and Filipino forces. The last stand of the American and Filipino forces relies on the approximately twenty-kilometer neck of the Bataan Peninsula, the gateway to the peninsula, formed by the Cabusilan Mountains, which run south from Zambales province, and the swamps at the mouth of the Pampanga River. If this point is breached, the fate of the Bataan Peninsula will be decided.

### British Parliament Reconvenes to Review Far East Battle Situation; Parliamentarians Express Dissatisfaction with Government Measures; Duff Cooper's Merits and Demerits Await Answers

Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) – A correspondent from the Basel News in London reports that both houses of the British Parliament recently reconvened, and parliamentarians expressed dissatisfaction. Lord Privy Seal Attlee, representing Prime Minister Churchill, failed to provide a detailed report on the battle situation, particularly regarding the question of whether the British land, sea, and air forces in the Far East had done their utmost in the recent war in Malaya, a matter of great concern to parliamentarians. However, it is expected that Prime Minister Churchill will return from Washington for the next meeting of both houses and report on the concrete results obtained from his talks with the United States. Therefore, British political circles anticipate that the government will issue an important declaration after Prime Minister Churchill returns. At that time, Prime Minister Churchill, with the help of another cabinet member, will answer questions frequently raised by parliamentarians regarding the current war. It is expected to take at least two days.

London, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) – Reuters recently reported that members of both houses of Parliament have expressed dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the Pacific War situation. When the next parliamentary session reconvenes, various questions will likely be raised regarding the government's actions in Malaya, similar to what happened after the battles of Narvik and Crete. Therefore, the upcoming debate in the House of Commons is very important and will likely last several days. Duff Cooper, the British cabinet member stationed in Singapore and former Minister of Information, will be summoned back to report on his experiences. Prime Minister Churchill will also participate in the debate. It is anticipated that members of both houses will raise for discussion the criticisms made by the Australian Commonwealth government regarding British errors in the Malayan campaign. According to parliamentary custom, such inquiries often lead to resignations of those responsible. Prime Minister Churchill may declare that he and his cabinet bear collective responsibility, which could lead to a cabinet crisis. However, observers of the political scene in London generally believe that there is no one else capable of leading Britain, as the world generally recognizes Prime Minister Churchill as the most suitable leader for Britain. When Lord Privy Seal Attlee, representing the Prime Minister, reported the situation to the House of Commons, he failed to provide a detailed explanation of the Malayan campaign. Several important points remained unclear, causing great anxiety among members of both houses. Foreign Secretary Eden, in view of the widespread dissatisfaction, has agreed to provide a detailed report. Furthermore, regarding the sinking of the British battleship "Prince of Wales" and the destroyer "Repulse" by Japanese aircraft, the government has already explained to both houses, but parliamentarians still do not find it satisfactory and continue to demand that the government explain why these two battleships were not given adequate air cover. Why did the British Air Force not act when the Japanese launched a surprise attack on December 8th? Why did the British command fail to destroy all military targets within the evacuation zone, and why were large quantities of raw materials and military supplies left to the Japanese? These are all issues that members of both houses want to know. Political figures say that members of both houses believe that the government's handling of the Malayan situation, both before and after the outbreak of the Pacific War, was mishandled. During recent discussions in both houses, several members demanded that the government explain the merits and demerits of Duff Cooper, but so far, the government has not responded.

Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) According to news from London, some members of the British Parliament have proposed the immediate establishment of an Imperial War Cabinet. They believe this is necessary to solidify the unity of the Empire and to eliminate the painful impression caused by the Australian Commonwealth's appeal to the United States. The Daily Telegraph also carried a dispatch from its correspondent in London, stating that all sectors here consider it extremely necessary to maintain imperial unity, especially to maintain close ties with the Australian Commonwealth and the New Zealand Dominion. The proposal to establish an Imperial War Cabinet does not arise solely from the recent outbreak of the Pacific War; it is also necessary to take this step in order to combine the economic and other resources of the various parts of the British Empire. So far, the British government has not opposed this proposal and has expressed its approval. However, there are some difficulties in adopting this measure, which is unprecedented in British history. Canada and the Union of South Africa may express dissent, for example. Furthermore, once Prime Minister Churchill returns from Washington, it is hoped that he will establish an Allied Political Committee, whose main task will be to engage in "political warfare." Its scope of activity should not be limited to the various parts of the Empire but should be parallel to the Allied Military Committee, with its mission being to coordinate the political activities of the Allied nations.

### Chinese Military Mission to Visit the United States

### Good Results from Trial Land Declaration in Hubei Province; Cultivated Land in Xianfeng County Increased Threefold Compared to Original Taxable Area; Tax Rate Halved, Total Revenue Increased by Onefold

Enshi, 11th (Telegraph Dispatch) Hubei Province, in order to implement the land valuation tax scheme after land declaration, first selected Xianfeng County for trial implementation last year.

### German Troops on the Eastern Front Retreat into Winter Quarters; Soviet Communiqué States Progress on All Fronts

Berlin, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) Military figures here say that German troops on the Eastern Front are continuing to cover the retreat of forward units in order to establish winter positions. Fierce battles have occurred in several locations. Since the German decision to retreat to new positions, Soviet forces have been launching continuous attacks, but they must pay a heavy price for every inch of territory gained. The casualty figures announced by the Soviet side are not reliable.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) Last night, Berlin military authorities declared that the retreat of German troops from protruding positions on the Eastern Front to winter quarters is proceeding according to plan. The covering operations of the German rearguard are extremely fierce. Enemy newspapers are sarcastically questioning why the German retreat was not carried out secretly, as Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff did on the Western Front in 1917. It should be known that in 1917, the military was operating on two fronts. This retreat is not intended to be secret because it is still intended to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. The losses suffered by the enemy in this offensive will be felt in the future.

Headquarters of the German Leader, 11th (Reuters News Agency Dispatch) This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front, the enemy launched counterattacks under the cover of tanks, but they were repulsed by German forces.

### Differing Opinions in South America Regarding Participation in the War

Rio de Janeiro, 10th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) The Pan-American Conference is scheduled to be held here on the 15th of this month. Representatives from various countries arriving here are asking whether the Latin American countries will declare war on the Axis powers. However, two points are very clear: one is whether the United States wants to drag the South American countries into the whirlpool, and the other is whether the South American countries intend to participate in the war. At present, the American countries have implicitly become two factions. One faction, mostly Central American and Caribbean countries, has declared war on the Axis powers. The other faction is South American countries, which have expressed solidarity with the United States but have not yet formally declared war. The Dominican Republic recently announced that it plans to propose to the Pan-American Conference that the American countries unanimously participate in the war. However, Argentine Foreign Minister Guani expressed disagreement with this, and the Brazilian Foreign Minister refused to answer directly. The remaining South American countries are also taking a "wait-and-see" policy. According to well-informed sources, Argentina, Brazil, and other South American countries believe that the best way to defend the Western Hemisphere before the Americas are directly attacked is to stay out of the conflict and provide economic assistance to the United States, similar to the United States' assistance to Britain. It is expected that a declaration will be issued at the conclusion of the Pan-American Conference, reiterating the solidarity of the American countries and stepping up economic assistance to the United States.

Rio de Janeiro, 11th (Reuters Dispatch) The Pan-American Conference is scheduled to open here on the 15th of this month. Representatives from various countries attending the conference are arriving in succession, indicating the enthusiasm of the countries to establish a unified principle. Even if this principle does not necessarily lead to a joint declaration of war against the Axis powers, it will promote the solidarity of the American continent to a complete and flawless state. According to the opinions of diplomatic circles, if the American countries decide to continuously supply raw materials, strive for internal consolidation in South America, and allow the United States to use ports and airfields, then North America will receive effective assistance.

### Authorities Designate Three Major Rice Warehouses to Supply Rice for Coded Sales; Rice Shops Ceasing Operations Seek Relief

The unified management of rice shops and the sale of foreign rice have been implemented universally since the day before yesterday. Ordinary citizens can purchase rice nearby, which is undoubtedly beneficial. However, yesterday, being Sunday, all rice shops were closed for the holiday as usual, and no rice could be purchased. It is reported that the two authorities have now designated Roosevelt, Moutai, and Fuqi three rice warehouses to release goods today to supply large quantities of rice to various rice shops for sale.

Rice Purchase Finger Dyeing to Start Tomorrow

Once this color is applied to the skin, it cannot be erased on the same day. This can prevent one person from purchasing rice multiple times in succession, resulting in an uneven supply.

Noodle Prices Return to Normal

The two associations of machine-made noodle industry and bread and steamed bun industry in this city had previously received an order from the two concessions that the selling price of noodles should be uniformly sold at 9 jiao 5 fen per catty in legal tender. However, because these merchants were insincere and procrastinated over time, engaging in private transactions, the price was raised to 1 yuan 3 or 4 jiao. They were discovered by the two concessions separately, and a total of more than 60 shops were fined or temporarily suspended from business as a warning in accordance with regulations. It is now known that after receiving this concrete warning, these flour merchants have eliminated their greedy hearts and are now able to uniformly follow the standard selling price of 9 jiao 5 fen per catty, and are selling universally on the market, benefiting the common people.

After entering the living room, they attempted to search the upper floors. At that time, the female servant, Aunt Wang, had become aware of the situation. She immediately ran towards the back door and shouted for robbers. When the robbers saw that the matter had been exposed, they failed on the spot and also swarmed out of the back door. Aunt Wang still chased closely behind, shouting incessantly. This angered the robbers, who fired two shots. One bullet hit the leg of the fleeing robber. Fortunately, the victim suffered no losses. Aunt Wang was brought by the patrolman and sent to the hospital for treatment by car.

At around 6 pm yesterday, six robbers suddenly broke into No. 970, Lane 391, Haig Road, and threatened them with guns. They were robbed of 1,300 yuan in legal tender.

At 6 pm yesterday, robbers broke into No. 5, Lane 455, Hankou Road, and robbed them of more than 300 yuan in legal tender.

At 7:20 pm last night, a man was walking through the intersection of Henan Road and Sichuan Road when he was robbed of a leather overcoat and legal tender, worth a total of 13,000 yuan.

At around 7 pm last night, a man was robbed at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Sichuan Road, losing an overcoat and 350 yuan in legal tender.

At 9:40 pm last night, a pedestrian on Kuling Road was robbed of an overcoat and 400 yuan in legal tender.

### Snowflakes Flying; Extremely Cold Weather

The weather in this port has turned from extremely cold to mild for several days. Since the night before last, the north wind has been blowing tightly, and the weather has been freezing. Snowflakes have been flying since early morning, becoming denser and denser, and only stopped towards noon. The weather turned sunny and cold after 3 pm in the afternoon. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, it snowed in various places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, including Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, and Jiangning yesterday, and the weather turned cold. In addition, the number of poor people who froze to death yesterday increased. More than 100 bodies were collected and buried by the Pushan Villa.

### French Concession Residents Returning to Their Hometowns Can Inquire at the Police Station; Convenience Will Be Provided

The French Concession Administration has announced on December 30, 1941, that it will allow Chinese residents in the concession who wish to return to their hometowns, provided that their location is outside the Japanese military police cordon line in Shanghai, and has stipulated conditions on file. Because residents still have gaps in their understanding of these conditions, the authorities hereby reiterate that all Chinese residents who meet the conditions of the December 30, 1941 announcement and wish to move to their hometowns can inquire at their respective police stations at any time, and will be given all helpful answers.

### Unrepaired Balcony Railing; Child Falls to Death

Ding Xu, a Ningbo woman living at No. 189 Avenue Edward VII, had a six-year-old boy named Ding Didi. At around 5 pm the day before yesterday, he was playing on the balcony of their four-story house. Because the balcony railing had been unrepaired for many years, it broke, and Didi fell from a high place into the alley below and was injured internally and in the brain. He was sent to Kwong Chi Hospital by his mother, but died due to the severity of his injuries. His mother then collected the body.

### Japanese Side Takes Important Measures; Economic Situation Changes; General Manager Reelected; Taking Over Factories, Clearing Banks, Food, Fuel, and Unemployment Problems Await Efforts

Economist An Fueneng commented on the economic situation in this port in the past week, saying that it has been five weeks since the Pacific War. After various adjustments were made to the situation in this port in the past week, it has changed significantly. After Japanese business and economic experts conducted a close inspection of the British and American interests in this port for several weeks, they began to take important measures in the past week to make Shanghai invest in the East Asian Economic Sphere.

Four Foreign Directors Resign and Are Reelected

The first major move in the past week was the resignation of the four British, American, and Dutch foreign directors of the Public Works Department. Tokyo had already considered it contradictory to the current situation to allow nationals of countries at war with Japan to remain in the Public Works Department. Therefore, the Japanese side requested their resignation. At the same time, countless personnel from anti-Axis countries also withdrew from various committees of the Public Works Department. The remaining directors of the Public Works Department then elected Japanese Director Okazaki to succeed Liddell as General Manager to continue handling affairs. As for the vacant positions, they are not planning to elect people to fill them temporarily. Currently, there are three Japanese directors, six Chinese directors, one Swiss director, and one German director in the Public Works Department. One British director and two American directors who are not in this port are not included. As for whether the transfer of senior staff of the Public Works Department is also under consideration, it cannot be said for sure.

Clearing Allied Banks

The second major move in the past week was the order of the Japanese Marine Corps to close and clear the Allied banks in this port. These banks were temporarily closed for the previous four days, and the supervisors appointed by the Japanese side to these banks were replaced by newly appointed liquidators. The liquidators immediately began work to conduct a final inspection of the current status of these banks, and their liquidation plans and methods can also be agreed upon. Most banks will reopen this morning. Current or savings deposits of small individual depositors can still be withdrawn. The significance of clearing Allied banks is to prohibit them from engaging in new business and to settle all major transactions as soon as possible. During the Pacific War, these banks will be closed forever.

Taking Over Major British and American Factories

The third important change in the past week was the Japanese side's appointment of supervisors to take over major British and American factories in this port and to restrict the work of these factories according to certain principles. As a result, 18 British and American factories were closed, especially cotton mills. Other factories were allowed to start work within a limited scope, or were allowed to start work completely and resume production. Several factories that were allowed to start work completely have been relieved of the restrictions they have been subjected to for several weeks, such as the unsealing of raw material storage facilities and the lifting of the ban on free sales. However, there are still many Allied factories that have not been taken over by the Japanese side, and they will probably be taken over soon. The Japanese side will sooner or later consider the general issues that have not yet been mentioned.

Food and Fuel Awaiting Assistance

As for the business of Chinese merchants in this port, the Japanese side has not taken any measures. In terms of the banking business of Chinese merchants, the position of HSBC has been replaced by the semi-official Yokohama Specie Bank. The vast majority of Chinese factories continue to work, but countless warehouses are still sealed. The major problems for the future of the entire Shanghai are the external assistance of food and fuel, and the newly arising problem of worker unemployment. The satisfactory resolution of these problems still requires our joint efforts.

### Stealing Paper Nets Arrest

Chen Zhichao, a Chongming native who used to be a waste paper vendor, has recently been unemployed. He colluded with Pan Gengchang, Liu Afu, and Lin Junfu, who are at large, to open Room 43 in the Longyu Hotel on Fuzhou Road to discuss theft. Knowing that Li Shucui Paper Factory at No. 67, Lane 478, Tiantong Road had a large batch of white paper stored, they hired two rickshaws late the night before last and drove to the address to sneak in through the back door. They stole 2,000 sheets of white paper worth 3,600 yuan, half of which were hidden in the hotel room and half of which were hidden in the house of Tang Wenjun, a Qingpu native, a friend on Aiguo Road, with the intention of selling them and dividing the money. The case was discovered, and detectives from the Hongkou Police Station cracked it, arresting Chen and Tang Wenjun, and taking all the stolen goods to the police station. They were sent to the Special Criminal Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian applied for detention. The court ordered a change of date for review.

### Impersonating Inspectors; Extorting Smugglers Sentenced

Wang Gan, a rascal from Zhenjiang, and Chen Zhaodong, from Jiangbei, discovered that Lu Gaojian Meat Shop at No. 1179 Gordon Road was storing a large amount of salt for private sale and profiting from it. At around 4 pm the day before yesterday, they colluded with a Korean man and went to the shop, claiming that they were inspectors from the Xianbing Brigade at No. 97 Shangwen Road in the Nanshi, and showed two fake cloth badges to the owner, Zhu Asan, saying that his shop should not sell private salt and that the goods should be sent to the headquarters for confiscation by car. Using various intimidation tactics, they said that if they wanted to avoid trouble, they would have to pay at least 300 yuan as a fee, otherwise there would be no way out. In desperation, the shop owner asked them to forgive him and reduce the fee. Fortunately, shop assistant Zhou Xinrong was alert and sneaked out of the door and reported to the nearby Japanese soldiers, who arrested Wang and Chen and took them to the Putuo Road Police Station along with the fake cloth badges. They were sent to Criminal Court Three of the Special Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for the crime of extortion and said that the defendant Wang Gan was a repeat offender, asking for a sentence. Judge Zhan questioned the two defendants and made a clear confession, sentencing Wang to eight months imprisonment and Chen Zhaodong to six months imprisonment, respectively, to serve as a warning.

### Poisoning and Collapsing on the Way

At around 2 pm the day before yesterday, a young man in his twenties, dressed neatly, was walking through the intersection of Zhenjia Wooden Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, when he suddenly collapsed. The patrolmen arrived and immediately sent him to Kwong Chi Hospital by car. After examination by a Western doctor, it was found that the man had swallowed medicine in advance, and collapsed at the place where the poison took effect. He died soon after because the poison was too deep to be saved. The French Police Station was notified to send a detective to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy site. It was reported that the autopsy proved to be true. Because there were no family members, the hall provided a coffin for burial.

### Hot Water Shop Owners Request to Continue Selling Cheap Coal Cinders

The coal industry in this city has been experiencing difficulties in purchasing coal cinders for hot water, and has now stopped selling coal cinders to the bathhouses that sell hot water and the bathrooms need daily. If merchants turn to purchasing high-priced coal, the cost will inevitably increase. More than 540 hot water shop owners in this city yesterday requested the coal industry to purchase coal cinders for hot water so as to continue selling them, benefit the common people, and maintain social order. The coal industry is now actively working on it.

### Mr. Tang Weizhi's Reading and Listening Notes—Authentic Gold

Mr. Tang Weizhi of Taicang is a great Confucian scholar of the contemporary era. He founded Wuxi National Studies School and promoted sinology with all his efforts. The author has long admired Mr. Tang's superb scholarship and moral character, especially his method of reading Chinese. The day before yesterday, he gave a public lecture on reading methods at the school, a rare opportunity, so I drove there happily. On the one hand, I could get a glimpse of his demeanor, and on the other hand, I could personally listen to his tone of reading, no wonder those who admired him came in droves. Three quarters of an hour before the lecture, the small auditorium was already packed to the brim. The clock struck ten times, and Mr. Tang was seen being supported by someone, his white beard fluttering, walking calmly among the crowd towards the podium. The audience stood up to pay their respects and applauded warmly, and the old gentleman nodded frequently with a smile. After ascending the podium and sitting down, the atmosphere was so solemn that not even the sound of a cough could be heard, and everyone was ready to listen attentively to his grand discourse.

This time, he read four articles, which were divided into four categories according to Zeng Wenzhenggong's hand-defined: Taiyang (Great Yang), Shaoyang (Lesser Yang), Taiyin (Great Yin), and Shaoyin (Lesser Yin), each with an example: The Taiyang vigor is exemplified by Jia Sheng's "Guo Qin Lun" (On the Errors of Qin), the Shaoyang interest is exemplified by Fan Xiweng's "Yueyang Lou Ji" (Record of Yueyang Tower), the Taiyin knowledge is exemplified by Han Tui Zhi's "Song Li Yuan Gui Pan Gu Xu" (Preface to Sending Li Yuan Back to Pan Valley), and the Shaoyin sentiment is exemplified by Ouyang Yongshu's "Wu Dai Shi Ling Guan Zhuan Xu" (Preface to the Biography of the Court Musicians of the Five Dynasties). The so-called Taiyang vigor contains a kind of erupting and turbulent labor, the Shaoyang interest contains a kind of humorous and leisurely interest, the so-called Taiyin degree of knowledge contains a kind of broad and implied degree, and the Shaoyin sentiment contains a kind of deep and tragic rhyme. Therefore, Mr. Tang's reading has its own merits. The method of reading was set by Zeng Wenzhenggong and passed down to Wu Qingfu of Tongcheng. Mr. Tang was a student of Wu Qingfu, and this continuous lineage feels even more precious. Now that he has lost his sight and is old, we really have a sigh of who will succeed him.

Before reading the text, he first explained the essentials of writing an article, and he pointed out that the heart must be pure, starting with cultivating one's character and energy, which is really a needle to the point. How can we expect a base, filthy, and treacherous person to write an immortal article? Even if they write it, it is only to sing praises for their masters and flatter their servants. Who would believe them? We see Fan Xiweng's "Yueyang Lou Ji" saying, "Be the first to worry about the world, and the last to enjoy its pleasures"; Ouyang Yongshu's "Preface to the Biography of the Court Musicians of the Five Dynasties" saying, "Worry and labor can revitalize a country, and pleasure and ease can destroy it"; The old gentleman used an earnest and enthusiastic tone, reciting them aloud, which could not help but immerse us in the general atmosphere of righteousness.

Mr. Tang read "Guo Qin Lun" with great effort, because it was the vigor of Taiyang, the tone was so majestic, the rhythm was clear, and the place where it was read to the climax made people bristle; Then, when it came to "Yueyang Lou Ji", the Shaoyang interest, it felt that it did not lose its majesty, but it did not have the strength of the Taiyang text. Listening to it seemed like eating a cigar, or the excitement of drinking a few cups of mellow wine. When it came to reading the third article, "Preface to Sending Li Yuan Back to Pan Valley", the old gentleman seemed to have exhausted his energy. He sipped a mouthful of boiled water and ordered a gentleman standing beside him to read it on his behalf. Although he could also read it with moderate speed, it always felt like he was losing his composure, without Mr. Tang's solid and grand air, coming from the dantian. Finally, for the "Preface to the Biography of the Court Musicians of the Five Dynasties", Mr. Tang picked up the challenge again, selling his remaining strength, reading it with a sing-song tone, using a gentle and comfortable tone to read out the Shaoyin text, which was really wonderful. Finally, he copied a section on reading essentials as a conclusion: "Every article should be read thirty times, first ten times to learn the method of refining qi, then ten times to observe the method of layout and intention, and then ten times to study the method of selecting words. Once the method of reading with intonation and speed is mastered, the progress of writing will naturally be rapid."

After the meeting, I saw people of all ages, celebrities, and ladies leaving one after another. I also embarked on the journey home with a satisfied mood. In total, there were no less than 500 people in the audience, and this grand occasion showed everyone's emphasis on Chinese studies, living up to the old gentleman's intention to promote it.

Spring and Autumn

### "The Return to Hometown Movement"

— Jin Yi

Western medicine advertisements are overwhelmingly for tonics, claiming either that the medicine's effects are "comprehensive" or that it has "unimaginable efficacy." This may be due to "scientific progress" or targeting the "weak and sickly" constitution of the Chinese people. However, the wealthy are still obsessed with Jilin ginseng and top-grade bird's nest, spending thousands of gold pieces on a winter's supply. Even those who settle for second best want a prescription for medicinal plasters or donkey-hide gelatin. Cheap cod liver oil at three yuan and several jiao per half-gallon is reluctantly swallowed by friends who are "poor but diligent" as a reward for a year of hard work. Only in recent years has the trend changed dramatically. Cibaoming pills are selling quickly, and there are countless brands of vitamin supplements. Even cod liver oil, which used to be fishy and greasy, now costs thirty to forty yuan per pound (previously only a few jiao), with a price increase far exceeding that of clothing, food (rice), housing, and transportation. The reason given is that imported goods are priced in gold pounds and US dollars, and according to daily exchange rates, "this price is still not enough to buy them." - This was the "catchphrase" of pharmacy clerks two or three months ago. In reality, lead plates and copper sheets, honey, woolen yarn, Hercules milk powder, ammonia, cod liver oil, and even white sugar and matches are all stored in warehouses (even upstairs) and not sold readily. Their motto is "earn money every day it's stored, lose money every time it's sold," so the less product available on the market, the more they frantically buy. If you are truly unfortunate enough to fall ill and require a specific specialty drug, you must pile up banknotes and still ask for favors to "get" your hands on it! However, "good times don't last long." "Selling cheaply" is not enough; they must also declare, "Returning to hometown today, inconvenient to carry" (have you read the "For Sale" section of classified ads?). Cheap goods are indeed timely, but friends with money to spare are also "richly stocked at home," while those without money to buy rice have already "returned to their hometowns early"!

### Facial Makeup

— Ni Ming

There are countless types of facial makeup in traditional opera. In the opera world, there are no fixed rules to follow. It all depends on oral transmission and memorization. What is memorized is simply the general style of a certain facial makeup (such as the three-tile shattered face or the chaotic face) and its color. In this way, even if there are countless types, it is not difficult to have a clear understanding. As for the subtle styles and colors of a single face, the artist creates them according to their own inspiration. There is no fixed standard. The artist who studies the Jing role's facial makeup with diligence can not only fit the imagery, but also make the audience's faces light up with joy. Although this is a minor art, it is enough to add to the audience's enjoyment of the opera.

In principle, the creation of the styles and colors of all parts of the face, such as the forehead, eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth, contains symbolic functions. For example, the gold coins on both cheeks of Ermudun's Gongming signify the characteristics of the God of Wealth. Such major points cannot be arbitrarily changed, but there are also some slight variations. For example, a thin strip of yellow is added to Dou Erdun's red eyebrows, intending to emphasize his majestic power like a tiger. Furthermore, take Xu Shiying in Zhu Yang Lou. It is generally known that he has a green shattered face. I once saw that Zhang Lianting, a martial Jing actor, applied pink to his cheeks, excluding his forehead, nose, and chin. The reason is that Xu is a young master in the Zhu Yang Lou play, so his cheeks should be pink. If the same green were applied to both cheeks as in Baishuitan, it would be impossible to distinguish his different identities and statuses in the two plays. As for the flowered brims of the eyebrows, because of his youthful impetuousness, they should be more pronounced than those of his Tongtian rhinoceros in Baishuitan later. From this, we can see that the makeup artist must have a deep understanding of the character's identity, status, personality, and special appearance in the play before they can transform it magically.

Once a facial makeup is completed, it has one look up close and a different feeling from afar. Up close, one only judges the evenness of the colors and the clarity of the lines but cannot appreciate the extent to which the character's appearance and expression are revealed. Seen from afar, the opposite is true. For example, close-up viewers of Zhang Fei's smile and Gao Deng's fierce expression may find them rigid, but viewed from afar, one senses a smile and a fierceness, each vibrant and lifelike. The display of the smile is in the cheeks, while the fierceness is in the eyebrows. In addition to having the understanding to sketch them out, the artist must also express them concisely to achieve the effect of being visible from both near and far.

Besides the Jing roles, there are many skilled facial makeup artists today, Gao Shenglin, a martial arts actor, being one of them. Shenglin loves this art and can blend the styles of various schools and genres into one furnace. Therefore, his facial makeup in martial arts plays, such as the faces of Qilang and Gao Deng, are uniquely imposing and uniquely styled, which is no accident.

### "Iron-Blooded Traitor"

The English name of "Iron-Blooded Traitor" is Dark Command, which means "Dark Command". As the name suggests, you can guess the chaos and darkness of the laws and orders at that time. The character here is a famous traitor in the history of the American Civil War. He used the name of a benevolent and righteous army to act as a bandit. In the Confederate war zone, he flew the flag of the Union Army, setting fires and burning, slaughtering and plundering cities. Conversely, in the Union war zone, he flew the flag of the Confederate Army, doing the same thing. Such a character is intertwined with a lingering love story. The script has pretty good material, which is enchanting enough. With the addition of the director's skillful techniques, there is no reason not to be perfect. Speaking of this director, he is very famous, he is the great director Raoul Walsh of "The Roaring Twenties", "Carmen", and "The Thief of Bagdad". Republic Pictures spent a large sum of money to hire this director to take on this difficult task.

### Farewell, Pan-Fried Buns!

— Si Hua

For breakfast or snacks, Sullivan is certainly a great place to go, but the average student and thrifty person cannot help but feel intimidated by the prices. Slightly more luxurious places, such as Shang Si Ru Chun and Wu Fang Zhai, offer steamed buns or shaomai. Usually, people get by with pan-fried buns or crab shell cakes, which have become everyday delicacies for ordinary people. Today, the Public Works Department, due to the difficulty of flour supply, has instructed the baking and steamed bun industry association that it will suspend the production of all non-essential foods for the common people from now on and try to bake large pancakes and steamed buns as much as possible. Otherwise, the flour supply will be stopped and the business license will be revoked. In this case, pan-fried buns, crab shell cakes, and similar "refined" buns and cakes are all prohibited.

One often sees groups of female students standing by the large pancake stalls along the Continental Shopping Mall. Their clothes are all chic, and they are waiting for the pan-fried buns to come out of the oven. It seems that they regard them as a satisfying lunch. Some wrap them in newspapers, and some chew them on the road, which is quite appetizing.

Usually, when buying snacks, one can order crab shell cakes at double the price. Due to the increase in oil and ingredients, the taste is better. Served with hot water, it is enough to make one's peers envious and compete to imitate them. Now, because the production of pan-fried buns, crab shell cakes, and similar foods has been prohibited, we will no longer have this comforting food, and we will have to learn from the northerners to fill up on tall steamed buns or large pancakes.

Thinking of large pancakes, one thinks of fried dough sticks. Fried dough sticks consume both oil and flour, but they have not been prohibited, which is a fortunate thing. Eating large pancakes and glutinous rice balls with fried dough sticks is like icing on the cake. Now that they are still available, the feeling of incompleteness can be avoided for the time being. Because I am saying goodbye to pan-fried buns, I would like to praise and retain fried dough sticks at the same time.

### Li Qinian's Illness

Since completing the movie "Modern Youth" directed by Ma-Xu Weibang, Li Qinian has been engaged in the production of a new film, "The Bandit Beauty". The film is almost six or seven tenths completed and will soon be finished. Since the eighth of this month, she has fallen ill due to a cold and work fatigue. As a result, filming has been suspended. It is reported that her temperature rose to 102 degrees yesterday, and two famous doctors are currently consulting. The Huabu authorities have agreed to grant her a leave of absence for half a month to a month for recuperation.

Sixteen The Fire of Youth

Every time he saw those dancers with waists as thin as water snakes and eyes as charming as thousand-year-old foxes in the dance hall, his heart would jump up and down wildly, but it was only a kind of desire. As soon as he walked out of the dance hall door and breathed in a breath of fresh air, his heart would immediately calm down.

"This is a poison. The label on the bottle is very clear. How can you drink it without considering everything?" He often warned himself in this way.

But as soon as he saw Mei Bao, he felt that this was definitely not a bottle of poisonous wine. Her plain clothes, natural and beautiful face, gentle and dignified demeanor, made Shao Hua fascinated. If she were to be compared to wine, then there would be nothing to compare to her except genuine French champagne!

The strangest thing was that he felt that this singing girl somehow resembled his aunt at home?

However, after returning home, he certainly did not dare to tell Xiang Qi, but secretly looked at her a few more times. As a result, the more he looked, the more she looked like her. So he felt extra excited in his heart.

He remembered very clearly that his father had said several times during casual conversations that his aunt was a school flower at the Tianjin Women's Normal School in the past. She was good-looking and smart in her studies. He really didn't know how many people pursued her. Finally, to save his father's tuberculosis, she married a warlord for the sake of money. Later, almost everyone felt sorry for her.

"If I could get a woman who looks as good as my aunt to be my life partner, Dad and Mom really don't know how happy they would be, and my aunt would also inevitably be greatly surprised. She would never dream that there would be someone in the world who looks so much like her!" One night after returning from the Shouronghua Restaurant, Shao Hua tossed and turned in bed for half the night thinking wildly. (301)

### An Appeal for Buying Rice

— Ping Ye

It is a fact that there are difficulties in adjusting Shanghai's grain supply. It is also a fact that the Public Works Department and the French Concession authorities are relieving the difficulties of the citizens' food supply. And it is also a fact that it is difficult to buy rice. This food problem, the problem that everyone entrusts their lives to, although everyone has talked about it enough and lamented it enough, has still not been completely resolved. Of course, this difficulty is multifaceted and requires everyone's cooperation to solve it together.

Here, we believe that if the concession authorities had not paid attention to this issue in the past, Shanghai's food supply might have faced unimaginable circumstances. The stability of the market today, which has not yet caused citizens to starve and fight, is still due to the maintenance of the concession authorities.

Those who buy rice struggle almost every day on the line of starvation. They get up early in the morning, not knowing which rice store will open today. They stand and wait blankly. If the store still hasn't opened by mid-morning, they have to rush to another rice store in frustration. Fortunately, this one is open. Like those who have reached their goal, they prostrate and line up. This group of fellow pitiful rice buyers, some are strong and powerful, some are familiar with the store clerks, and some can obtain convenience. "We are all rice buyers today, why must we compete for first and last"? However, they eagerly hope to exchange all their strength for three sheng, but those who obey the order and the old, weak, women, and children are bound to fall behind, and disappointment is inevitable. Returning home, the fire cannot be started until the rice arrives. Now that the rice cannot be bought, they have to endure their hunger and take care of miscellaneous matters. With a half-disappointed mood, they go to the rice store again. Seeing thousands of rice buyers on both sides, the strong and powerful are still in front, and they naturally have to line up last, hoping for a lucky chance. As a result, perhaps the sign "Today's foreign rice sold out" is hung up, and they still wipe away their tears and go back. Thus, there are news reports of families committing suicide by poisoning and not being rescued, some of which are published, and some of which are not published due to space limitations.

Today, as the concession authorities strive to regulate the food supply, the public's expectation is that rice will be sold strictly according to numbers, that the normal daily sales volume of each rice store will be distributed to buyers according to how many numbers there should be, and that those who arrive later will not be given numbers, so as to avoid pushing and shoving, which would only affect order, and also to avoid rice buyers wasting time and delaying their affairs. Those who squeeze in to buy foreign rice, resell it, and buy rice several times a day will be investigated and punished. If there is a more detailed method, that would be even better. These lamentations naturally especially hope that among the rice-buying public, everyone can love themselves!

Family

### Economy First

— Hua

There are more family problems to talk about now than before, but these problems are not about how the living room should be decorated, how duck down quilts should be purchased, and what wines should be used for banquets. Instead, they should be based on the premise of economy. We can think of the following points, which should be implemented immediately:

A monogamous family is naturally the simplest organization. At this time, a new budget for economy can be determined, and all daily expenses can be reduced. If there is a family in which brothers, sisters-in-law, and sisters-in-law live together, they should cooperate at this time and not allow the ill feelings that often exist between sisters-in-law to continue to exist. Two coal stoves that were originally used can be combined into one, meals that were originally eaten separately can be eaten together, and servants that were originally hired separately can be dismissed one or two. Even when doing laundry, the soapy water can be used to wash several pieces of clothing together. If a little can be saved in every place, the accumulated savings can reduce the burden.

At the same time, the choice of dishes is also worth paying attention to. Many inexpensive vegetables have abundant vitamin content, which is more beneficial to the body and cheaper than expensive chicken, duck, fish, and meat.

Under the restrictions of electricity, we might as well get up early and go to bed early. Those who have always lit lamps at night can simply not light them. Those who have always used 40-watt light bulbs can replace them with 25-watt light bulbs. Getting up early is convenient for everyone in the family. The work that needs to be done can be handled more smoothly by getting up in the morning, and going to bed early every day can eliminate the snacks that every family must eat every day.

In families with relatively ample finances, instead of gathering to gamble, why not do some beneficial pastimes? Renovating old clothes and re-knitting old woolen sweaters are also tasks waiting for housewives to do. Husbands can also read a few more books at home. Even if you have to go to the office every day, if the road is not too far, you can get up earlier, or take the car for a while and then walk for a while, which can save some money and give your body some exercise.

The happiness of family life is not entirely in the material aspects; the spiritual aspects may be more important. If every family can cooperate and improve family life under the conditions of economy, then enjoying a happy family life is not impossible at any time.

### The Thoughts of a Spanish Playwright

— Si

The Spanish playwright, soldier, and great lover Lope de Vega was a superman in the war drama world. He was born on November 25, 1562. In Song Chunfang's first collection of essays on drama, he was called a playwright who was "unprecedented and unsurpassed" because he left behind an astonishing number of works in his lifetime. Even comedies alone numbered as many as 1,800, not to mention other works, letters, etc.

In his lifetime, he said the following: "In my garden, I have some flowers, half a dozen drawings, and a few books. I have no more extravagant desires in my life." The person who excerpted these words once pointed out that they were the mature wisdom he had after tasting the experiences of life.

Naturally, there are no obvious flaws in these words on the surface. However, if we analyze them carefully, we will wonder why he didn't say, "I have a virtuous wife" or "I have a happy family". There is a reason for this.

Because in his lifetime, although he was very busy writing, he had many opportunities to interact with women. He interacted with women from time to time and had many lovers. Even after marriage, he could not devote his love to his wife. Therefore, in his older years, he no longer felt the preciousness of family life and only hoped to look at books in the garden as a way to spend his leisurely years.

However, no one in the world does not want a happy family life. If a man or a woman dislikes his or her family life, there must be some shortcomings in his or her family. Many people's love cannot be focused, and naturally, they cannot work hard to improve their family life. As a result, they are mostly in pain. Modern couples should absolutely abide by sexual morality. Lope de Vega's talent is admirable, but his behavior is not a good example for us.

### Family Governance Sayings

— Yuan Shan

Reading is the foundation of starting a family; following etiquette is the foundation of protecting a family; diligence and thrift are the foundation of governing a family; harmony is the foundation of managing a family. (Zhu.) The rise and fall of a family depend on propriety and righteousness, not on wealth, nobility, poverty, or lowliness. Suppose one is as noble as a duke or minister and as rich as a Chong Bi, but one has no propriety or righteousness. Then the family will decline. If one eats simple food and drinks plain water, one is not concerned with the fineness of clothing and food, but one has propriety and righteousness. This is what it means to say that the family is thriving. (Lu Xiangshan)

Serenity, conscientiousness, and respect are the first methods to teach young children; fairness, impartiality, and strictness are the first methods to be a parent. (Zi Sheng Bian)

By observing how early or late one sleeps and wakes, one can know the rise and fall of a family. (Jing Xing Lu)

When a person is extremely angry, his wife and children should advise and comfort him in a tactful way and must not raise their voices or get angry. Therefore, it is said that if a family has a virtuous wife, the husband will not encounter misfortune. It is also said that a virtuous wife in a family is like a good prime minister in a country. (Lu Qingxian)

My Family Problems

### Unveiling of Micro-Essays, Part Fourteen Who Will Support Me?

— Hui

After marriage, thirty years passed in the blink of an eye. My temples are sparsely streaked with silver hair, and my face has some dry and wrinkled lines. I am old, an undeniable fact! Raising four sons and three daughters to adulthood is my achievement in old age.

Among these four sons and three daughters, I gave birth to three sons and two daughters. The rest were raised by my husband's previous wife (because I am a second wife). They have all grown up, and the youngest is over twenty years old. They have all married or left the family and established their own small families. All that is left is me, lonely and helpless.

The illusion of "raising children to guard against old age, storing grain to guard against hunger" has shattered on its own. I live in the house that my husband left me and wear the old clothes that I remade from my wedding clothes, but I don't have food or other living expenses. I don't know who should support me?

If I had known this would happen today, I should not have married in the first place. After marrying, I should not have raised so many children, or I should have been cruel and sent all these children to the orphanage to save myself the burden. The money I saved on raising and educating them would be enough for me to live on for another thirty years. What would I have to worry about? Why wouldn't I do it!

I cannot blame my children entirely because they do have their own difficulties: the money the sons earn is not enough to support their wives; the daughters cannot produce anything at all and are relying on their husbands to eat, so they have no extra money to subsidize me. Moreover, the children all have a mentality, which is "I should plan for my children! Mother doesn't belong to me alone; let others take care of her." Is this way of thinking wrong? I don't know; however, I believe that they will encounter the same old age as me and that their children will treat them in the same way that they treat me.

It is true that raising children is a parent's natural duty, but isn't supporting parents a child's obligation? I also know that treating children as one's own property is selfish; they are products of society, but I don't know how society should treat me?

Editor's Note: Regardless of the system, in the transitional era of the alternation between the old and the new, there are always many victims. The transformation of the family system is naturally no exception. Ordinary old-fashioned parents (such as Old Master Gao in "Home") are obsessed with dreaming of five generations living under one roof and do not realize that the large family cannot exist anymore. Ordinary young and unwise couples also misunderstand that a small family must not allow the existence of elders in order to produce happiness. Therefore, in families that are neither new nor old, many tragedies are produced. The situation of Mrs. Hui has become a victim of this transitional period. I think that nothing can be absolute, especially in the family, because the health of the family depends entirely on cooperation and understanding. If there is a little prejudice, a happy family cannot be created. Since Mrs. Hui cannot live in a specific family, it is best to live in each family in rotation or have each family pay a little subsidy fee, no matter how much, according to their ability. In this case, there is no other way but to open negotiations with your children. You must not let the four sons and three daughters each fail to take responsibility and not ask or hear. At the same time, Mrs. Hui also has to consider the current burden of living. Even if she lives in one of her children's homes, she cannot think of enjoying happiness and must give them some help in their work. Since she can write this micro-essay, she may be able to help educate and raise their children.

I hope that future parents will no longer have the idea of "raising children to guard against old age" and that young couples will not be too irresponsible and shirk each other. Everything must be prepared for in due time, especially the complex and intricate family problems in our country, which are worth discussing by everyone to lay a solid foundation for the future family.

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

— Hua Ying Wenshi

Under this flying snow, the cold is pressing, and it seems that a hot pot is needed for dinner. There are four types of hot pot. The most luxurious is the white copper yipinguo (a rich man's hotpot), followed by the old-fashioned bronze or white copper warm pot, and then the aluminum small pot and the casserole. At the moment, when it is inconvenient to get alcohol, it is more convenient to use an old-fashioned warm pot with charcoal. As for the dishes in the hot pot, it depends on how economical and plentiful they are. The yipinguo often requires a whole chicken, a whole duck, and a whole pair of trotters or a whole piece of ham, which cannot be done without dozens of yuan and is not affordable for ordinary families. As for the old-fashioned warm pot, its capacity is not large, and both meat and vegetarian dishes can be put in at will, with vermicelli and spinach as the main ingredients. You can garnish it with fish slices, meat slices, dried shrimp, frozen tofu, etc. In this way, two or three kinds of specified meat dishes can be put together. The cost is limited, and you can drink hot soup in the cold weather. Why not do it?

### (156) Improved Education

— Draft by Lü Yeming

Preparation: One hen, salt, soy sauce, superior soy sauce, MSG, essence, five-spice powder, chopped scallions, minced ginger, cooking wine, caul fat, lotus leaves, thin hemp rope, wine, mud, sesame oil

Method: First, kill the chicken (choose a fat and tender hen), pluck the feathers, remove the internal organs, wash it clean, and lightly rub the inside of the abdomen with salt. Then, immediately soak it in soy sauce for five to six hours. Separately, take fresh pork with both lean and fat parts, wash it, and cut it into small cubes. Mix it with ample amounts of MSG essence, five-spice powder, chopped scallions, minced ginger, and cooking wine. Then, take the chicken out of the soy sauce, and immediately stuff the mixed small meat cubes into the chicken's belly. Wrap the chicken with caul fat, and then wrap it tightly with lotus leaves. Secure it with thin hemp rope. Then, apply a layer of wine mud (the wine mud must first be mixed with water until it reaches an extremely sticky consistency) on the outside of the lotus leaves, about half an inch thick. Then, put it in the embers of pine firewood and simmer it. Simmer for about four hours before serving. During the simmering process, turn it over every hour to ensure that the chicken inside the mud receives heat evenly. Before serving, first break off the outer layer of mud, untie the rope and remove the lotus leaves. Slightly coat the chicken skin with sesame oil to enhance the aroma. This method of making [chicken] originated in Changshu. Initially, when it was made, the feathers and internal organs were cooked together, but now it has been improved.
