German Führer's Headquarters, 8th, Renter News Agency

Today, the German military communiqué claimed that enemy advances in the Caucasus region were repelled, while our troops continued to penetrate enemy positions. Enemy troops in Stalingrad continued to retreat from several locations. Enemy troops encircled in the northwest have been annihilated. Shipping on the lower Volga River and in the Caspian Sea was also bombed. German troops east of Kaluga, in a surprise attack, captured a hill position from the enemy. Enemy troops entrenched in the forests south of Lake Ladoga have been driven out. Enemy counterattacks have all failed. Enemy attempts to cross the Neva River repeatedly have been repelled. The German Air Force continued to bomb the enemy's northern railway lines. Several strongholds of the enemy have been lost in Kandalaksha, Lapland.

Rome, 7th, Havas News Agency

An Italian war correspondent, recently returned from the Eastern Front, reports that the Red Army's ability to defend Stalingrad appears to have weakened slightly, with a gradual shortage of military equipment and ammunition, especially heavy artillery and tanks. However, the Red Army still holds the northern part of the city, supplied by paratroopers or small boats crossing the Volga River at night. However, the replenishment of tanks and heavy artillery is quite difficult, thus greatly affecting their resistance. According to a report from the Giornale d'Italia, German and Italian forces in the Don River region have used incendiary bombs to great effect against Soviet tanks. However, in recent days, a large number of new Soviet tanks have arrived, moving very quickly and able to pass unscathed through the fire lines laid by incendiary bombs. At the same time, the Red Army in Stalingrad continues to use artillery units on the left bank of the Volga River to constantly bombard German positions, and it is difficult for the advancing German troops to make contact with the German artillery units, so they cannot retaliate.

Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency

German forces have concentrated artillery fire for four days, fiercely attacking the factory zone northwest of Stalingrad. According to a United Press Moscow dispatch, German forces continue to reinforce with transport planes. Engineering and construction battalions that previously participated in the attack on Sevastopol have also joined the battle, launching dozens of fierce attacks on Soviet troops with the cooperation of German tanks and infantry.

(B) Matters for discussion: (1) The Chairman submitted for discussion a case from the Executive Yuan, based on a report from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the implementation of increased official salaries for central government agencies will soon reach one year, and that current prices continue to rise. In order to encourage civil servants to work with peace of mind, it is proposed to grant a temporary additional doubling of salaries from November of this year, based on the previous year's increase method. Public servants will also receive an additional 80% as originally planned, and seven restrictive measures will be established to avoid further increasing the burden on the national treasury. The case was submitted for review and decision. The resolution was passed and sent to the National Government for implementation. (2) The Chairman submitted for discussion a case from the Executive Yuan, based on a report from the Ministry of Finance, consulting the provincial government on a proposal to increase the silk improvement fee in accordance with the example of silkworm silk, and to levy a supplementary local silk improvement fee and special tax. Considering that this matter involves changing tax rates and increasing the burden on the people, it should first be submitted to the councilors of this Yuan for review and signature, and then the two ministries of Finance and Industry should jointly review and propose opinions to the National Government for approval. The resolution was passed at the 131st Yuan meeting and the case was recorded and submitted for review. The resolution was passed and the Legislative Yuan was instructed to revise the "Provisional Regulations on the Dried Indigo Tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces" with reference to the revisions.

### Nanjing Executive Yuan Orders Prohibition of Rice Merchants Spreading Rumors

Nanjing, 8th, Central News Agency

Executive Yuan Instruction (No. 588) orders Zhou Xuechang, Mayor of Nanjing Special City, and Deng Zuyu, Chief of the Capital Police Headquarters, to strictly enforce the grain control policy. This is because the government, in view of the serious situation and the insufficiency of domestically produced rice, established the Grain Management Committee to manage national grain administration regarding production, sales, and prices in a comprehensive manner, in order to balance supply and demand and ensure an equal distribution of food for the people. Since its implementation, it has had considerable success. It is reported that recently, unscrupulous rice merchants in the capital city have arbitrarily spread rumors against the control policy. Some gentry, not understanding the meaning of the system and not recognizing the needs of the times, have echoed their sentiments, advocating for the unscrupulous merchants and creating all kinds of seemingly plausible arguments to confuse public opinion and disrupt people's minds. Such deliberate sabotage, hostile to the people's food supply, is extremely reprehensible. It must be known that in the past, rice merchants could hoard and speculate, trade freely, and prices could rise and fall arbitrarily, with generous profits and personal gain at the expense of the people. This was already inconvenient in normal times, but it is even more unacceptable in the current situation to sit idly by while they harm the people and benefit themselves. Now that control has been returned to the government, the people can share the joys and sorrows equally, while these people cannot maintain their undue advantages. If these people are allowed to spread rumors and deceive the public to achieve their selfish goals, the future of the people's food supply will be even more unbearable. The Mayor and the Chief of the Capital Police Headquarters should jointly issue a clear proclamation, strictly prohibiting unscrupulous merchants from spreading rumors and causing trouble. If anyone dares to deliberately violate the order, they will be punished severely as saboteurs of the grain policy and monopolizers of the people's food supply, and those who spread rumors and cause trouble should be secretly investigated and punished to the full extent of the law to emphasize the importance of grain security and maintain the people's food supply. In addition to distribution, it is ordered to comply with this order and report the compliance situation.

### Rumor that Stanley Proposed a New Agreement Between Three Countries, Soviet Union Proposed Military Committee, Requests that the United Kingdom and the United States Will Agree

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency

According to the Yomiuri Hochi, a special telegram from Argentina to Seoul states that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley has decided to return home immediately to report on his duties after Stalin issued a statement. Therefore, the future direction of relations between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union is worthy of attention. A telegram from Washington states that Stanley has advised Roosevelt that, in order to win over the Soviet Union, the United States should conclude a new agreement between the three countries to improve joint operations against Germany.

Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency

According to Reuters Moscow, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley recently decided to return home within three days to report to Roosevelt and paid a special visit to Stalin on the 7th for a meeting.

Stockholm, 8th, Renter News Agency

According to London news, British人士 have begun to discuss Stalin's request for the establishment of an Allied military committee and no longer discuss the issue of a second front. The United Kingdom and the United States have weighed the pros and cons and chosen the easier option to implement. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union General Stanley may be carrying Stalin's advice to the defeated generals in Viesfor. London insiders believe that the United Kingdom and the United States will agree to establish a military committee and send representatives from the Soviet Union as well, in order to ease the atmosphere in Moscow. However, neither Roosevelt nor Churchill intends to abandon military leadership, and the differences of opinion between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union may become more and more apparent. Currently, Soviet newspapers continue to criticize the failure of the United Kingdom and the United States to fulfill their promises of aid to the Soviet Union, and the newspapers also publish satirical cartoons.

### Reduced Military Aid, Dissatisfaction with the United States in Various Countries

Stockholm, 7th, Havas News Agency

The Basler National-Zeitung recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that the written statement recently issued by Stalin to American reporters was purely to express the Soviet Union's dissatisfaction with the current policy adopted by the United States. The Soviet Ambassador to the United States recently went to the State Department to lodge a protest, demanding that the United States change its policy. The Soviet Ambassador believes that the United Kingdom and the United States should immediately muster the courage to formulate a bolder operational plan. In the past, American soldiers had a creed that the United States could only launch an offensive after working with its allies, but at this time, they seem to have abandoned this view, and the isolationism commonly seen in the political world seems to have spread to military leaders. Until the United States entered the war, the U.S. policy was to supply military equipment to its allies in accordance with the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act. However, today, due to the United States' own need for a large amount of military equipment to build a large army, the amount of military equipment supplied has also been reduced to a minimum. The military authorities have now decided on a quota for military equipment exports, so the allies are all dissatisfied with this situation and believe that their needs should not be sacrificed due to the U.S. military reorganization plan. The issue of opening a second battlefield is closely related to the issue of supplying military equipment and other necessities to the allies. Therefore, the current attitude of the United States is quite unpopular with the allies.

### Germany Announces List of British Ships Sunk

Berlin, 8th, Renter News Agency

The above twelve merchant ships were all sunk by German submarines. Another list of twelve sunken British ships will be announced in a few days.

### Partial Reshuffle of Canadian Cabinet

Ottawa, 7th, Havas News Agency

Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King stated today that the cabinet has undergone a partial reshuffle in order to include three representatives from Quebec Province (Note: Quebec Province is inhabited by French people). The personnel are as follows: (1) Major General LaFleche, Deputy Minister of National Defense for Army, promoted to Minister of National Defense for Army; (2) Member of Parliament Pergan, Minister of Fisheries; (3) Liberal Party Member Fornier, Minister of Naval Construction. These three new ministers will be sworn in today. However, this cabinet reshuffle will not cause any changes in Canadian politics.

Stockholm, 8th, Renter News Agency

Canadian Prime Minister King announced yesterday the reorganization of the cabinet. Canadian legal persons joined the cabinet. The former Deputy Minister of National Defense for Army, LaFleche, was promoted to minister. Fournier was appointed Minister of Public Works. Bedland was appointed to the cabinet of five members of Quebec Province. Six members of the Ontario cabinet were employed. The incidence of the Canadian cabinet was caused by the Prime Minister's need for internal affairs. Later, the legal persons of Quebec Province had appropriate representatives in the government.

### Danish Political Situation Still Tense

### Willkie Has Left Chongqing, Met with Stilwell Again Before Departure

Lisbon, 8th, Domei News Agency

According to a message from Chongqing, Roosevelt's personal envoy Willkie flew from Chongqing yesterday afternoon. This news was not allowed to be published in the newspapers until today. Willkie had a second meeting with Lieutenant General Stilwell, commander of the U.S. forces in the Chongqing area, at noon on Tuesday, lasting about twenty minutes.

Published Views on Visits to Various Countries

Lisbon, 7th, Domei News Agency

U.S. Envoy Willkie issued another statement in Chongqing on the 7th, saying that this statement was to explain his personal views and called for an active offensive against the Axis. At the same time, he admitted that the distribution of armaments by the United Nations was unfair. The general idea of his statement was: "Since I departed from the United States, I have visited thirteen countries and carefully examined the current situation of the governments and peoples of these countries. The people of these United Nations have three hopes: (1) Victory of the United Nations; (2) Launching an active offensive against the Axis immediately; (3) Freedom and independence after the war. However, after the war, it is doubtful whether the major democratic countries will actually respect the freedom and independence of other countries. However, what I have gained from this trip is that a defensive war will hardly be won, and the benefits to the American people have been repeatedly announced to the world in numbers regarding the increase in domestic production. However, some United Nations claim that the armaments sent by the United States are very few. If this is considered a disruption to American production, it is not necessarily unreasonable. The United Nations should adopt appropriate plans to allocate the armaments equally to the Soviet Union and Chongqing. However, it is difficult to win by only providing weapons. We must have hope for the future. Some people in the United Nations doubt the attitude of the major democratic countries towards freedom and independence after the war, which is enough to make the countries lose their enthusiasm for actively cooperating in the war. It is extremely difficult for us to win without the support of the general allies. Some people have held talks with me and expressed their displeasure with the American so-called Atlantic Charter. They have raised the question of whether the countries that signed the Atlantic Charter agree that the charter applies to the Atlantic? The United States should issue a simple and clear statement to help me answer."

### British Forces Occupy Two Cities in Southwest Madagascar

### Blackout Achieves Satisfactory Results, Air Raid Drill Has Ended, Authorities Issue Communiqué Expressing Satisfaction

Domei News Agency, This Port - The blackout training period ended last night. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command expressed satisfaction with the significant improvement of this passive defense measure. The blackout training ended last night, two days earlier than the originally scheduled ten-day period. The Air Defense Command issued a communiqué last night stating that the results of the blackout exercises conducted after dark fully reflected the Shanghai residents' understanding of the current situation and their sincerity in cooperation. Blackout in the French Concession and the Public Concession was very good. The Chinese areas and the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek were also quite good. The Public Concession has undergone strict supervision by the relevant authorities in recent days, and the blackout measures have been significantly improved and are quite satisfactory. However, residents in the Yangshupu District and the area west of Wing On Company still need to pay attention to improving blackout measures, while blackout in the Nanshi and Pudong areas is not effective and special attention must be paid in the future. The communiqué further enumerated the following points that can make the city's air defense measures perfect: (1) Residents must pay attention to distinguishing the three stages of preparation, alert, and air raid control. During the preparation blackout, business must continue as usual, and the purpose of the alert blackout is not to suspend any business. (2) All residents who have not prepared for defense and have not made preparations to shield window lights must take appropriate defensive and shielding measures. Light bulbs should be removed from lights that are not commonly used. (3) The back of houses and patios are most likely to leak light and must be given special attention. (4) Automobile lights must also be given attention. Generally speaking, the control of front lights is satisfactory, but the rear lights are not. (5) Residents must be prepared at all times to quickly implement all blackout measures within seconds after an alarm is issued. Anyone who takes a long time to prepare should prepare in advance so that they can implement them immediately upon receiving notification. (6) Some street lights have too much reflection, and their strong light is reflected into the sky from the walls. Further research will be conducted on this point. The results of radio broadcasting control during the eight-day training period were also satisfactory.

Hundreds of Households Penalized for Violations

The Shanghai Times reports that the French Concession Police Department took strict measures to implement its warning to residents to abide by the blackout regulations. On Monday and Tuesday nights, hundreds of households were penalized for violations by cutting off their electricity for several hours to the entire night. So far, the authorities have not imposed fines on violators in accordance with the French Consulate General's air defense proclamation. However, the French Police Department is working closely with the Baojia system to warn violators and inform them of the best ways to shield lights in their homes to prevent them from leaking.

Fire Drill Achieves Good Results

The English-language Great American Evening News reports that Mr. Matsudaira, Deputy Director of the Police Department's Traffic Bureau and Director of the Defense Committee, praised the Baojia personnel for their enthusiastic participation in the first simulated air raid fire drill held this afternoon (8th). It is said that the Baojia personnel, who had only received two or three days of training, performed well in the drill held on Putuo Road yesterday, and the fire brigade once again proved to be a very effective group. Since the Baojia personnel were participating in a fire drill for the first time, there was no shortage of areas for improvement. After more drills, it will be even more effective. The rescue work of the Baojia personnel was also very satisfactory. They helped to carry the injured to the side of the street, where they were transferred to the first aid station by the health department. Their work was commendable. Fire drills will continue to be held in other areas of the city, and this special work training is currently being carried out among the Baojia personnel.

### Western Newspapers Eagerly Encourage Japanese Residents in China, While the Continental New Report Makes a Profound Warning; The Times Elaborates and Encourages

Yesterday, the Shanghai Times published an editorial titled "A Warning to Japanese in China," stating that a recent editorial in the Japanese-language Continental New Report issued a significant and earnest warning to Japanese residents in China, urging them not to treat Chinese people as if they were conquerors. It quoted an ancient Japanese proverb that even conquerors should tighten their armor. Japanese in China should uphold this spirit and conduct themselves with courtesy in their daily lives, refraining from arrogant behavior towards the Chinese people.

Hoping Not to Repeat the Mistakes of Britain and America

The purpose of the current war should not be overlooked; it goes without saying that Japanese should be vigilant in preventing a repetition of the mistakes made by the United States and Britain in China. If Japan merely replaces the old British and American influence in China, most of its war efforts will have been in vain. Japan's true wish is to help China become independent and cooperate with Japan to break free from British and American shackles and achieve lasting peace and prosperity for the nations of Asia.

Should Strengthen China's Power

Therefore, Japan should strengthen China's power and not deliberately hinder the continuation and growth of China's economy and defense capabilities. To help China become stronger, a new situation must be established that eliminates imperialist aggression, so that the Chinese people can use their natural abilities to seek the greatest benefits for their country and the world. If Japan mistakenly takes another step towards imperialism, it will become a second Britain and America in China and defeat its own purpose.

Japanese Residents Should Know They Bear Great Responsibility

We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the need for Japanese residents in China to act with caution. In recent times, especially since the outbreak of the East Asian War, the behavior of Japanese residents has raised doubts as to whether they fully understand their important responsibilities. The fact that fourteen leading merchants from Shanghai visited Nanjing for the first time on Tuesday may indicate the doubts that many Chinese leaders have about Japan or the achievements of the Nanjing government in China.

Must Assure the Chinese People of Their Sincerity

Therefore, when Japan states that it has no territorial or material ambitions in China, it must assure the Chinese people of its sincerity. To achieve this goal, all Japanese residents in China should voluntarily help the Chinese people understand Japan's policies better. If some Japanese residents behave in ways that contradict Japan's stated goals, how can it be hoped that the Chinese people will trust Japan's words and actions? This may sound harsh to Japanese residents in China, but if they do not gain the trust of the Chinese people, it will be extremely difficult to establish a new order of co-prosperity in East Asia.

Everything Must Start from the Ground Up

American and British residents in China have now lost their former prestige, but many Chinese people still seem to be silently under the influence of British and American propaganda. The depth of Chinese trust in them is evident. If the Japanese want to eliminate American and British influence in East Asia, they must start from the ground up, eliminating the factors that still cause the Chinese to trust Britain and America. Strict measures must be taken to prevent the resurgence of American and British influence, such as banning shortwave radios. At the same time, Japanese should also strive to win the cooperation of the Chinese people.

### Japanese Go Masters Visit Chinese Chess Friends

They also presented Zhang with a 4-dan certificate from the Japanese Go Institute. The Japanese chess community is very strict in awarding ranks, and Zhang's receipt of this honor is a wonderful story in the Sino-Japanese chess world.

### Record of Rongwu Society Sutra Lecture

In the 67th lecture of the Rongwu Society Sutra Lecture, Mr. Shen Jueling lectured on the differences between the scriptures and commentaries in "Essentials for Studying the Book of Changes." Yunhan Shuyi Wenzhi Book of Changes 12 chapters complete Shanghai classics Confucius' ten wings, commentary, upper biography, family upper biography, image upper biography, image divination, clean words upper biography, commentary divination, text blind biography, gossip biography, sequence biography, miscellaneous gossip biography ten chapters as twelve chapters Although collectively referred to as scriptures, the commentaries and the scriptures are separate. Zhu Liu originally used Wang Bi's Book of Changes, that is, Zheng Kangcheng, according to Fei Zhi, to attach the biography to the scripture, the biography of Xiang Shang, Xiang Bu Xiang Shang Xiang Bu Xiang Wenyan attached to the scripture, and the remaining five biographies are still separated from the scripture. In the Song Dynasty, Zhu Zi used Lu Zuliang's version to restore the old eleven chapters. In the Qing Dynasty, Zhouyi Zhongzhong used Benyi, Benyi first, then Cheng biography, then Jishuo, collected from the imperial editions from Han to Ming, and recorded Benyi below the Zhu Liu Ben, thinking that it was not Benyi. The annotation of Benyi is clear that it is not the original of Benyi. It is the most confusing. Those who study the Book of Changes take Li Yi... Fengguo... I heard... Zhao

### The Bond Market Is Unpredictable

Over-the-counter trading in public bonds was still quite busy yesterday. The market price fluctuated by about 2 yuan. Initially, the bulls raised prices, and then many bulls emerged. Afterwards, retail investors absorbed the bonds, so the price fluctuated. Type C bonds were the most popular, changing hands several times at the 60 yuan level. Sellers were slightly more dominant. Type C bonds once fell below 59 yuan, seeing a low price of 58.8 yuan. Although they broke through 60 yuan several times, they were still at 59.5 yuan afterwards. People in the industry had different opinions and reasons, so it is still difficult to predict the future of the market price. Type A bonds were still outside 60 yuan at 60.01 yuan. Type B bonds were at 59 yuan, Type D at 56.6 yuan, and Type E bonds at 57.5 yuan. As a result, except for Type A bonds, which rose by 1 jiao, the rest all fell by small amounts of 2 jiao to 5 jiao.

East Cloth

The market is still in a state of flux. However, the recent trend is that bank warehouse receipts south of Suzhou River are becoming scarce. In the past, buyers were often concerned that bank receipts stored in warehouses for too long might be moldy or damaged. Now, they no longer hesitate, which shows a change in perception. Yesterday, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, Sincere Single, was 168 yuan, with little change, but the bank notes were more actively traded. The closing price at noon was 159 yuan, continuing to rise by 2.5 jiao. Colored Ball fine cloth was 158 yuan, down 2.5 jiao. Flying Fish 156 yuan, Yang Suzhu 154.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge red coupons had very few transactions, closing at 6.92 yuan at noon, down 2 fen, but bank serge rose to 6.8 yuan, an increase of 5 fen, and the price has gradually leveled off.

### New Beans Arrive in Shanghai, and Transactions Become Active

Yesterday, dried sweet potatoes were still firm and rising. Qingdao dried sweet potatoes more than 30 bags priced at 141 yuan.

Bean cakes have recently been gradually increasing in transactions as new goods have been coming on the market. The market has been rising due to high expectations. Yesterday, Changji bean cakes opened at 1,000 pieces priced at 64.5 to 60 yuan. Feizi bean cakes three vehicles priced at 65.5 to 66 yuan.

### Ornaments and Discount Rates Remain Unchanged

Yesterday, the price of ornaments sold by jewelry stores in Shanghai was still 2,450 yuan per tael (about 300 yuan less for purchases). The price of inter-dealer trading first varied and then slightly recovered. The morning price was 2,240 yuan, 20 yuan higher. The Russian market rose to 2,255 yuan, and those who saw the high price sold, and the price fell back slightly by 25 yuan, to 2,230 yuan. The price of silver for ornaments was still 14 yuan per tael. The price of inter-dealer trading was 13.5 yuan, slightly weaker.

Yesterday, the discount rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 1 jiao and 4 fen. Also, the total number of bills exchanged in Shanghai in September was 231,440, with an amount of 222,326,667 yuan.

### Industry Briefs

Daily Use Soap Sells Well

The market for daily necessities such as soap continues to rise. Match prices once rose sharply, but transactions cooled off yesterday.

Headache powder 22 yuan, Universal Oil 21.5 yuan, Partridge Vegetable 56 yuan, Dragon and Tiger Ren Dan 13 yuan. There were no changes.

Fragrant mushrooms are not pure, but the market inventory is relatively sufficient, so the recent trend has been to remedy the situation. Now, they are selling for 3,200 to 4,500 yuan. However, the stock of high-quality fragrant mushrooms from the east is rare, and the price remains high, selling for up to 8,500 yuan, which is relatively firm.

Longan Meat Rising

Recently, there have been more new goods arriving, but in some cases, the bills of lading have not arrived, and the goods cannot be picked up temporarily, so the spot goods are still scarce. Yesterday, the market opened and rose by another 50 yuan. The market is tight.

### Slap and Laugh (Random Reading Thoughts)

— In addition to idleness

Although clowns do not occupy a very important position on the stage, they are always welcomed by the audience - because they can make the audience laugh heartily and relieve boredom. Clowns have done their best in this respect.

Clowns have many ways to get people to laugh. Pressing a piece of white on the nose and shaking a fan while saying humorous words is one way. Climbing walls and jumping on trains, like Rock, doing funny actions is also a way. But the principle seems to be only one, that is, the clown has to say unreasonable words and do unreasonable actions.

But saying humorous words requires turning your mind, and doing funny actions requires effort. For the Russian mystic symbolist, Andreyeve, in his famous play "The Slap in the Face," provided a simple way: a clown does not need any martial arts or literary talent. He just needs to stick out his face and let the other characters on the stage slap him. After the right ear is slapped, let others slap the left face. After being slapped, he has to laugh and bow to the slapper. Once, this clown was slapped a hundred times, which made the audience feel satisfied and laugh out loud, and this clown became popular.

However, if this clown suddenly starts crying sadly because of his own miserable life experience and complains about his intolerable life after stepping down from the stage, then the audience will definitely feel very disappointed. I think someone in the audience will say something like this: "I paid to have fun, not to see you crying."

Audiences do not sympathize with clowns. This is unreasonable. Ancient Roman emperors felt that watching people and beasts fight was a cruel form of entertainment. But I think those who can laugh after watching a clown being slapped are also indulging in a kind of cruel appreciation for entertainment.

However, everyone does not feel this way. After watching the clown being slapped and laughing heartily, if the excitement is still there, perhaps someone will shout, "Another one!" This is probably because people are used to some unreasonable things.

### A Disease That Cannot Be Diagnosed

— Zhihu

Coming out of the consulting room, I did not doubt that my friend comforted me and deliberately said indifferently that I was not sick. At night, I went to an unfamiliar doctor, and the result was still that I was not sick.

I have been feeling very uncomfortable for the past few days, but I cannot point out what kind of discomfort it is. I can even say that the entire physical mechanism is suffocating, but under the stethoscope, it proves that I am definitely not sick.

A friend said that this is due to the climate. After a summer of great liberation, people feel like they are entering a cage, just like a free crow suddenly being locked in a cage in the bleak autumn. Although it can fly, sing, and eat, it is deprived of its freedom. People feel like crows being locked in cages from summer to autumn. Doctors can diagnose your body, but they cannot diagnose your mental state.

This is an example, and it is not measured by my wanting to refute him, but I do not have sufficient reasons to refute him.

### Night Walk

— Zoba

Our class ends at 8 p.m.

She and I are in the same grade and go the same way. Whenever class ends, I always see her rushing back, walking faster than me.

Last night, because of an air-raid drill, the streets were pitch black. As usual, I walked home.

Suddenly, a voice called me from behind, "Zoba, please walk slower. Let's walk together."

I couldn't see who it was, but I heard her clearly.

"Okay," I said, waiting for a few minutes until her footsteps caught up.

During the blackout drill, there were no lights on the road.

"It's not easy to even see people's shadows," she said.

"Oh."

"We should bring a flashlight next time," she added.

"There's no need," I replied. "Unless it's always on, otherwise it will not only blind yourself, but also make others dizzy. We should take this opportunity to train our eyes. Every major city in the world today, such as London, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Moscow, Vienna, etc., is practicing."

"But walking in the dark is always terrible."

"People who walk at night in the countryside can manage it. Moreover, our city has such good, flat, and straight roads. In small places, people walking at night have no street lights, so they look up at the sky. Between the walls on both sides, what they see is the dark, silent sky. If you walk while looking at the sky, you won't bump into anything."

"So you won't stumble in bad places?"

"So it's just for familiar roads that I can answer," I replied.

"Are you saying that people can get used to this kind of darkness?"

"That's right. Everything can be gotten used to. You will soon get used to it, just like a city dweller who is not used to walking long distances. When he arrives in the countryside, where production is abundant and there is no boat or car to take, he has to walk. And after walking more, he will think that he has gained a kind of experience."

Then, the traffic lights shining over the intersection made me feel so comfortable, especially the green light with a longer wavelength, which suddenly gave my tired body a kind of balanced comfort.

"Seeing a light in the darkness seems particularly happy," she said.

"Yes, on nights with bright lights, people don't cherish the lights. Most of the value of the lights is obliterated. At that time, many lights are wasted."

The traffic lights quickly passed, and we ventured in the dark for a long time.

After a few minutes of silence, she said again.

"Yes, it's much better now than when we just came out of the brightly lit classroom. At that time, it wasn't easy to see even people's shadows. Now, you can even see the height of the sidewalks."

In the darkness, I heard her smile, a comforting smile, and it was gentle.

### Life and Death

— Yang Zhigang

Recently, newspapers have revealed many noteworthy news items, such as the significant decline in infant birth rates, and in contrast, the unabated surge in the number of abandoned infant corpses. Furthermore, there have been frequent reports from funeral parlors indicating that they are often overcrowded with corpses. These interwoven news stories of life and death are the best reflection of the reality of society.

Among them, the most concerning issue is the drastic decrease in the number of infants born in this city. The decline in birth rates certainly has its realistic and complex objective reasons. However, it is undoubtedly a very serious social problem.

There have been many similar events in modern history. During the First World War and for several years after its end, the infant birth rates in various European countries also experienced a historically rare decline, especially in Britain.

At that time, the Manchester Guardian published a profound commentary stating that blindly hoping for population growth is a barbarian superstition. The question is, are there not countless people who are underfed and poorly clothed, and even more who toil year-round without warmth or nourishment? Adding to this population of unhappy people is of little significance. Therefore, how to find ways to improve the lives of people in this society is, in any case, more important than blindly hoping for an increase in birth rates. At the same time, it is also a prerequisite for addressing the decline in birth rates.

I strongly agree with this and deeply resonate with this famous argument.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jiazhai

(10) Flying Peak

Wei Shaoyun fell backward. He was supposed to fall suddenly. The force of the oncoming person's punch, with that weight, would have made a loud "thud" sound, conveying the sound waves to the east room, startling Little Zhuge and his group to their feet. But Wei Shaoyun fell without making a sound. Why was that? The assailant darted over, clenched his fist, and punched down, while using his left hand to slowly cradle Wei Shaoyun's neck, letting him fall to the ground. Didn't that prevent the sound from happening? This blow made Wei Shaoyun's eyes blur and his ears ring. He couldn't hear anything anymore. A mouthful of blood spurted out of his mouth. He unconsciously cried out in pain. As soon as he opened his mouth with that blood, the assailant seemed to be prepared, stuffing a wad of cotton into Wei Shaoyun's mouth in the blink of an eye. Wei Shaoyun passed out, and he had no chance to cry out again.

Cui Zhen, on the bed, didn't know who had come. She only saw Wei Shaoyun fall down. She thought, "Could it be someone resorting to violence to resolve a dispute, someone jealous and competing with Wei Shaoyun for my affection?" But then she looked again and saw that the person had a shaved head and was wearing a set of coarse blue clothes, looking like a worker. On his face, in a fit of rage, several veins were bulging. Not menacing, but heroic. Cui Zhen suddenly understood that it was Huang Long. As soon as she opened her mouth, Huang Long quickly and quietly said, "Don't speak!" As he spoke, he picked up one of Wei Shaoyun's arms that had fallen to the ground, intending to lift him over with great energy. Some lifting over, he still threw his arm away, stepped to the front of the bed, and hurriedly untied the ropes on Cui Zhen's hands and feet. He softly said, "Sit up, let's go. What are we waiting for?" Cui Zhen stretched her hands and feet and shook her head, saying, "I've become a cripple. My hands and feet are numb." Huang Long never knew how to be polite with people. He tugged on Cui Zhen's hand. Cui Zhen borrowed some momentum and sat up, asking, "Are there people outside their door who can walk?" (198)
