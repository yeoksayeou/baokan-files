### The Zymlyansk Area: German and Soviet Forces in a Tug-of-War; Situation Still Urgent in Lower Don Region; German Forces Advance Toward Volga River

Haitong Press, Berlin, 28th - The German military communique this afternoon stated: "The bridgehead established near Rostov after crossing the Don River has been significantly expanded through our efforts. Infantry and mechanized units east of the city have crossed the Don River, reaching areas such as Mangye and Sal. Northwest of the Kala district, battles continue. German and allied forces south of the city have landed after crossing the Don River in the lower reaches. Key Soviet transportation routes and air force bases are being bombed day and night by German aircraft. Fifty-three enemy aircraft have been shot down. Several Volga River cargo ships have been sunk, and several freight trains have been hit and damaged. South of Rostov, German aircraft are destroying the enemy forces resisting. Soviet forces in the Voronezh area have suffered significant losses in manpower and materiel, and did not launch a large-scale offensive yesterday. Enemy forces trapped in the central sector, in addition to those captured, have mostly been annihilated. Enemy forces attacking the bridgehead in the Volkhov area were ultimately repelled after fierce fighting."

Allied Press, Bern, 28th - German forces in southern Soviet Union are advancing towards the lower Volga River in two directions. One route is about fifty miles from Stalingrad, and the other is advancing ten miles south from the Don River. Their destination is likely the wealthy Caucasus region. Soviet newspapers acknowledge that the situation in the lower Don River region, spanning three hundred miles, remains very urgent.

Allied Press, Lisbon, 28th - Reportedly, German and Soviet forces are engaged in a tank battle in the Zymlyansk area on the southern bank of the lower Don River. The two armies are advancing and retreating, resulting in a tug-of-war. However, the Soviet side acknowledges that the Red Army has slightly retreated from that area. The Red Army's flank has been severely threatened since German forces occupied Rostov and Novocherkassk.

Havas, Stockholm, 28th - It has been a month since German forces launched their summer offensive in southern Soviet Union. German and Soviet forces currently have hundreds of thousands of soldiers and thousands of aircraft engaged in combat south of Rostov. The German objective is Krasnodar, located about one hundred and thirty miles south of Rostov, which is an oil refining area. Although there is a road connecting the two cities, it is crossed by as many as twelve rivers, giving Soviet forces a defensive advantage. The battle situation near Zymlyanskaya, one hundred and ten miles northeast of Rostov, appears to have stabilized. However, German forces are continuously transferring fresh troops to the southern bank of the Don River in the hope of expanding their bridgehead. The fighting is currently very intense. From the Soviet perspective, the Don River, about two hundred and thirty miles long, can be forcibly crossed at any point, making it impossible for the Red Army to prevent. Therefore, the Red Army's main defense line will be east of the river, between the Don River, Krasnodar, and the Stalingrad railway. Moscow has acknowledged that the German vanguard is now only forty-five miles from the Volga River, and a major battle is about to take place between the Don and Volga Rivers.

Allied Press, Moscow, 27th - According to an official announcement by the Soviet Information Bureau on the 27th, Soviet forces have withdrawn from both Novocherkassk and Rostov.

Haitong Press, Berlin, 28th - According to German military headquarters, German forces on the lower Don River have occupied Bessergenevskaya, located about twenty kilometers east of Novocherkassk on the northern bank of the Don River. German forces have broken through the Don River's defensive fortifications at that location.

Haitong Press, Berlin, 28th - According to well-informed sources, German and allied forces have occupied Betskoye, south of Veshnevskaya on the southern bank of the Don River. This is an important Soviet stronghold. German forces have built multiple bridgeheads on the southern bank of the Don River. German forces are also continuing to advance in the Don River bend area. There have been no major developments in the battles north of Voronezh. Soviet attempts to break out have continued to suffer heavy losses. A fierce battle involving tanks and mechanized units has taken place in Karach, about six hundred kilometers east of Kursk. The coastline controlled by Soviet forces in the Black Sea, which was previously 1,950 kilometers, has been reduced to 650 kilometers between the Kerch Strait and Batumi.

Haitong Press, Berlin, 28th - The German High Command announced last night that a Soviet 1,200-ton transport ship, two oil tankers, five barges, and a tugboat were sunk by German aircraft in the Volga River area during the day and night. The barges contained troops and ammunition. Several other barges were damaged. Other German aircraft attacked a town in the Kuban region in multiple waves, causing eight major fires and numerous smaller fires.

### Strengthening the Central Reserve Bank's Currency Issuance System; Establishment of a Loan to Japan Totaling 100 Million Yen; Agreement Signed Yesterday

Allied Press, Tokyo, 28th - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 5 PM today that the Imperial Government, in response to the request of the National Government, has decided to provide a loan of 100 million yen to the Central Reserve Bank in order to promote the sound development of the Central Reserve Bank's currency issuance system. The loan agreement was formally signed today between the Bank of Japan and the Central Reserve Bank.

### Statement by Finance Minister Zhou

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - Finance Minister and President of the Central Reserve Bank, Zhou Fohai, issued a statement regarding the 100 million yen loan, saying, "Through the mediation of the Japanese government, the Central Reserve Bank has today concluded a 100 million yen loan agreement with the Bank of Japan. The establishment of this agreement is of great benefit to the sound development of the government's currency system and the establishment of the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank. The Central Reserve Bank has a short history since its establishment, but its progress has been extremely smooth. Recently, the success of currency unification has made Central Reserve Bank notes the basic currency of Central China."

### Statement by Finance Minister Kaya

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - After the establishment of the 100 million yen loan between the Bank of Japan and the Central Reserve Bank, Japanese Finance Minister Kaya issued the following statement: "The Bank of Japan's loan of 100 million yen to the Central Reserve Bank agreement was concluded today. In June of last year, our government reached an agreement with the National Government for a loan of 300 million yen. This time, in order to assist the sound development of the National Government's currency system, the Bank of Japan is lending 100 million yen to the Central Reserve Bank. In order to make Central Reserve Bank notes the basic currency and to unify the market value of Central Reserve Bank notes with military scrip, the National Government is both promoting the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes and establishing their independent value. Since the implementation of these policies, the National Government's monetary system has gradually been unified, and the credit of Central Reserve Bank notes has become increasingly consolidated. This time, in order to further promote the sound development of the currency system, Zhou Fohai came to Japan to negotiate a loan of 100 million yen. Our government has always made its best efforts to assist in the strengthening of the National Government and the consolidation of the Central Reserve Bank, so we are happy to provide this loan. Therefore, the decision was made for the Bank of Japan to lend 100 million yen to the Central Reserve Bank. The Bank of Japan is the central issuing bank in Greater East Asia, and the Central Reserve Bank is also a very important part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, these two banks should maintain close ties and cooperate with each other. From this perspective, we can understand the extremely significant meaning of this loan's establishment. With the establishment of this loan, I firmly believe that the issuance reserves of Central Reserve Bank notes will be further strengthened, and that there will be a more tangible effect on the work of currency unification. We sincerely look forward to this."

### Statement by Governor Yuki

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - President Yuki of the Bank of Japan recently made a statement on the 100 million yen loan, stating, "The Central Reserve Bank is a powerful wing in the financial world of Greater East Asia, and I am confident that it will have solid development in the future. Therefore, the Bank of Japan will spare no effort to provide full assistance. Furthermore, the establishment of this loan, along with the previous loan from the Bank of Japan to the Thai Ministry of Finance, will further establish the foundations of currency and yen credit in various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and new institutions. Therefore, the mission of the yen in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will become even more important. As for the outline of the agreement: The Bank of Japan will lend 100 million yen in Japanese currency to the Central Reserve Bank for a term of five years. The Central Reserve Bank shall pay interest on the loan at an annual rate of three and a half percent. The Central Reserve Bank may repay this loan at any time within the stipulated five-year period. The right term may be extended upon mutual agreement between the parties."

### Heavy Fighting Resumes: American Aircraft Bombing Tobruk and Crete

Allied Press, Lisbon, 28th - According to news from Cairo, after the British army's offensive in the northern sector was repelled, fierce fighting broke out along the entire Alamein line yesterday, and the artillery battles became even more intense. This is a prelude to the resumption of land warfare on the Egyptian front after three days of silence. Both sides are rushing to prepare for a large-scale operation to occur at any time. Although the fighting is intense at the moment, it is limited to local engagements, rather than a full-scale battle on the entire front. The Cairo Gazette acknowledges that British forces have abandoned some of the land they recovered yesterday under heavy concentrated shelling from German artillery.

Allied Press, Lisbon, 28th - According to scrambled dispatches from Cairo, the Egyptian Alamein front has been silent for three days. On the night of Sunday last week, fighting resumed, but it was only of a local nature. The battlefield was in the northern Mediterranean coastal area. Details are not yet known.

Haitong Press, Rome, 28th - The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that the enemy's offensive south of El Alamein yesterday was unsuccessful, resulting in heavy losses. The German 90th Division and the Italian "Trento Division" captured 1,000 prisoners, destroyed 32 enemy tanks and 30 armored vehicles. At the southern end of the battle line, an enemy tank force attempted to press closer to our army's defense line, but was driven back by artillery fire. Reconnaissance units from both sides engaged in fierce fighting, forcing the British army to retreat.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 28th - According to a report from London, the British army's offensive in the Alamein area has been stopped by Rommel's army's landmines and field artillery. As a result, the British army has gained nothing except in direct attacks. The landmines laid by the Axis forces from the coast to Qattara Depression have established a strong defensive position. Furthermore, according to news from Turkey, approximately 200 eighteen-ton tanks from the German army have recently been reinforced Rommel's army through a certain country, and have already traveled from a certain place via Crete and Tobruk. Most of the German troops waiting on Crete are also moving to North Africa. The current Egyptian front is relatively stable. The British army's deployment currently consists of British troops and Australian troops holding the area ten kilometers west of Alamein in Deir el-Eissa, and Indian troops securing the important positions near Qaret el Himeimat. The current tranquility on the front is the calm before the storm.

Havas, Somewhere on the Egyptian Border, 27th - In the past 24 hours, fighting on the Egyptian front has been silent due to severe sandstorms. Even minor clashes and scouting activities have almost completely stopped. Currently, the British army's positions extend from the high ground west of Alamein south to the Qattara Depression, a distance of about forty miles. Recently, the British army has strengthened its outposts. Rommel's army has also dug trenches and laid landmines. However, the British army believes that this does not mean that the German army is taking a defensive posture, but rather that they are preventing a British surprise attack. It is reported that a convoy of Axis forces, under heavy protection, is carrying ammunition to North Africa to resupply General Rommel. Allied air forces are currently preventing them from approaching the coast and are bombing transport bases such as Tobruk and Sidi Barrani. It is reported that the American air force has also recently joined the fighting. In particular, the bombing of Tobruk harbor on Sunday last week was carried out by American bombers. In addition, the American air force bombed the Heraklion airfield on Crete the day before yesterday. According to military experts, the narrowness of the North African front is extremely advantageous to the Axis powers. In this situation, even with a large British force, it is difficult to carry out a flanking maneuver. At the same time, General Rommel has placed tanks and artillery at strategic points and has made full use of the terrain to arrange his positions. However, both the British and German sides say that the current calm will be difficult to sustain.

Haitong Press, Rome, 28th - Frontline news states that a few days ago, a British armored vehicle force launched an attack on Italian positions in Alamein in North Africa. British Commander-in-Chief of North Africa General Auchinleck personally supervised the battle at the front. Due to the special terrain of that area, the Italian side only deployed infantry to defend it. Auchinleck believed that the tanks could break through the Italian infantry, but they did not succeed. The British tank offensive was repelled, and thirteen vehicles were destroyed by our forces.

Haitong Press, Milan, 28th - It is announced here that Colonel Fangigliarini, commander of the Italian 65th Infantry Regiment, was seriously wounded in action on the Egyptian front and has now died of his wounds. The Italian military communique on the 24th of this month praised his bravery. The soldiers of this regiment have repeatedly made outstanding achievements in fighting on the Western Front. Colonel Fangigliarini was one of the most capable officers in the Italian infantry.

### The Situation is Unpredictable: Sweden May Join the War; Prime Minister Hansson Delivers a Speech

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: Swedish Prime Minister Hansson stated in a speech delivered in several cities on Sunday that the development of the situation may force Sweden to fight for its most precious ideals. The current war is of great concern to Sweden, but there is no need for anxiety if all warring nations can respect Sweden's neutrality. The only unsettling event is the repeated violation of Swedish airspace by foreign pilots.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Prime Minister Gan Sen stated in a speech here today that while both sides of the current great war are making every effort to respect our country's neutral status, this situation is subject to change at any time, at which point we will have no choice but to fight to defend our democracy and freedom. In addition, General Helquist, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, also delivered a speech to soldiers in a certain location: "In my opinion, Swedish soldiers are among the best troops in the world. The only flaw is a lack of combat experience. However, if we are forced to fight, we will certainly fight for our country, this can be stated with certainty. In short, we not only have excellent military equipment, but also elite soldiers and capable generals."

### England and America to Change Strategy in the Atlantic; Important Meeting Held in Washington; Nelson Suggests Building Aircraft

Washington, 27th, Vahas News Agency Dispatch: Military and political leaders from England and the United States are currently holding a very important meeting here, planning to completely change the strategy adopted by the Allies in the war zone, especially in the Atlantic. The most important problem currently encountered by the Allies is the issue of transportation. Personnel here generally do not recognize that transportation lines are actually in the most important position in the current war. Regarding this level, the Axis powers have a clear advantage. The transportation lines of Germany and Greece are not only very short, but also very safe. In the past eight months, that is, since the United States entered the war, German submarines have achieved initial success in the Atlantic, which is also an undeniable fact. According to a survey by the U.S. Wartime Shipping Bureau, the number of Allied merchant ships sunk in one week from the 5th to the 12th of this month was very large. Since the outbreak of the current war, the losses in this one week are the heaviest. Admiral Waferlich, of the Naval Battle Bureau of the German Naval Staff, recently said in a speech that "If the enemy can build more merchant ships, then we will build more submarines and continue to sink them, ensuring that the number sunk is greater than the number they can build. I can absolutely assert that we will be able to destroy the enemy's war machine," etc. It can be seen that Germany has decided to go all out in this regard. The U.S. government is expected to be aware of this. The only way to deal with the submarine crisis is to use aircraft as a means of transportation. Nelson, the head of the wartime production bureau, has already appointed a special committee to study the issue of using aircraft to transport commercial goods, and has submitted a report advocating doubling the production of commercial aircraft, expanding the fuselage, and increasing it to seventy tons. The U.S. General Headquarters will hold a meeting this week to discuss this report in order to decide whether to adopt this suggestion. If it is decided to adopt it, then nine naval shipyards will be converted into aircraft manufacturing plants. Based on this, the attention of American military personnel has shifted to aviation, believing that using aircraft as a tool for offensive strategy and believing that the best way to defeat Germany is to bomb Germany, "Dealing with it in the manner of a large-scale bombing of the port of Cologne." As a result of such bombing, Germany's industrial strength could be completely destroyed. Once this goal is achieved, invading the European continent and opening a second battlefield can be done easily.

Lisbon, 28th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: U.S. Democratic Senators Lee and Johnson jointly submitted a proposal to Congress requesting the construction of a giant aircraft fleet to transport troops and war materials as a countermeasure to the submarine threat, since airborne transport is the only opportunity to win. Lee further stated that the German declaration to build enough submarines to obstruct American shipping routes was not an empty threat.

British-Indian relations are now at a critical juncture. British Prime Minister Churchill broadcast to the United States via wireless radio on the 27th, criticizing Gandhi's attitude.

Indian political parties or political leaders who want to open their doors will cause our Allied forces and air force to be threatened by the enemy. We will not sit idly by. According to Churchill's intention, this is to criticize Gandhi's uncooperative attitude and allow pro-British political parties to gain a major dominant force.

Various signs indicate that cholera is spreading rapidly.

Rampant Epidemic; Pay Attention to Health

At a time when cholera is becoming increasingly rampant, Shanghai's health authorities are warning citizens to be careful and pay close attention to hygiene to avoid contracting the disease. The most serious period for cholera cases in the past 22 days was from July 19 to 25. During this period, as many as 220 cases occurred in the Chinese areas, the reason for which is actually due to the uncleanliness of drinking water and citizens' inattention to hygiene. According to the weekly report issued by the Public Works Department's Health Department today, among the 45 epidemic cases in the past week, five Chinese people have died.

Public Works Department Adds Offices

In addition to the existing vaccination sites, the Public Works Department announced yesterday that it will add vaccination offices at the following locations starting August 1.

### Notice from the Japanese Military Authorities in This City: Citizens Should Obey Air Defense Regulations

According to the Domei News Agency, the highest authorities of the Japanese Army stationed in this city, recognizing the importance of air defense in this city, have adopted thorough air defense measures. The highest commanders of the Army and Navy have issued a notice, and the Fourth Army Garrison Authority has issued a statement, hoping that the general public will strictly abide by the air defense regulations. The notice states: All citizens residing in Shanghai shall fully comply with the obligations stipulated by the relevant authorities regarding various civil air defense regulations. July 29, year 31. The supreme commanders of the Army and the supreme commanders of the Navy, and the Army and Navy Garrison Authority issued a statement saying that with regard to air defense measures in Shanghai, given the importance of this city, the relevant Japanese authorities have taken thorough measures. Furthermore, elite Japanese aviation units have preemptively attacked enemy air bases and defeated their air power. Therefore, until today, Shanghai has been free from the danger of air raids, and citizens have been able to live and work in peace. This is a cause for great rejoicing. However, as the Greater East Asia War develops into a world war, considering the mobility of aircraft, it cannot be said that Shanghai will absolutely not be the target of aerial guerrilla warfare. Therefore, regarding civil air defense, one should always "be prepared and not alarmed" and adopt foolproof countermeasures. Therefore, the highest commanders of the Army and Navy have issued a notice to the citizens of Shanghai, imposing on them the obligation to fully comply with various civil air defense regulations stipulated by the relevant authorities. The Shanghai Garrison and the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force, the former being the Shanghai Army Air Defense Command and the latter being the Shanghai Navy Air Defense Command, guide the municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Japanese Consulate Police in implementing air defense measures for the general public regarding civil air defense matters. It is hoped that henceforth, all citizens of Shanghai will strictly abide by the regulations and instructions of the authorities regarding air defense.

### Talking About the New New Capital Hotel (Continued): Streamlined Antique Style

— A Regular Customer

The east and west corners have two large dining rooms, specially designed: one is called the Ancient Hall, with furnishings and utensils completely antique; one is called the Modern Hall, completely streamlined, the work of architect Fan Youzhao and engineer Wu Hanmin. Engineer Wu is a new and outstanding talent among modern architects, his works admire the beauty extracted from simple lines, especially paying attention to the very subtle details that can be justified. In the new New Capital Hotel, you can find many special brushstrokes, and there are also West Chamber small seats, this term is strangely cute, it is said that the New Capital will have a famous dish in the future, which will also be called "Meet Less, Part More." It can be called a double delight. The West Chamber is said to be a place for those who specially seek comfort from the opposite sex to have a drink. On both sides, there are no uneducated people coming and going. They can talk about love. The light is good, the seats are comfortable, and especially from the elevator, you don't have to go through the lobby in public, but go directly into the West Chamber; compared to the always Zhang Sheng who has to overcome the obstacles, I don't know how much happiness.

### Artistic and Scientific

All sofas, dining chairs, wool carpets, and silver tableware are completely detached from the old style. The color is also very consistent with the artistic conditions. The selection of materials is extremely noble, so compared to the average person who only knows to move red and green things up, it is considered "rich and magnificent", which is not the same. Potted plants are arranged everywhere, designed by Zhou Shoujuan, the owner of Cardulu "Xiangxueyuan", a specialist in seasonal flowers. Music, it is said that in the future, in addition to selecting jazz music with good melodies, classical music will be offered to customers every week. That is another special point. There are also oil paintings by Fang Xueyu, a famous artist.

In addition to these, the reporter must also specifically mention a few points: the hotel implements scientific management. Every bell in each dining room has a direct line to the management office. If the waiter does not come in after the guest rings the bell for the third time, the red light of that number in the management office will light up. With this method of management, the waiter will not dare to be lazy. There is also a direct telephone to the kitchen, which can be used to urge dishes at any time.

Telephones, every large room has, there are fifteen machines in the whole store, and each room has a cloakroom, which is probably a new record for all Shanghai restaurants. Of course, with so many telephones, it is easier to implement scientific management in all parts.

In addition to Cantonese cuisine, the menu also includes Sichuan cuisine, Ningbo cuisine, and Suzhou cuisine. As for whether the dishes are cooked quickly, Mr. Li said that he restricts each common dish to be served to the customer within seven minutes of ordering.

### A Masterpiece in the History of Restaurants

In short, the new New Capital Hotel, mobilizing more than a dozen experts, after four months of preparation, and spending three million yuan of savings, the impression given to us is really extraordinary. If we say that Zhuangyuanlou, Hongyunlou, and the like belong to the first period in the development history of Jiuying Pavilion, and Weiya to Xinya Jinghua Hongmian belong to the second period, then the New Capital should belong to the first work of the third period.

### Buyers Discouraged, Government Bonds Return to Tired Path, But There is No Lack of Low-Cost Absorption

Yesterday's black market for government bonds unexpectedly returned to a tired path, which is what most experienced people can see, it is a temporary psychological effect, and has no relationship.

In fact, like Shun Gongmao, it is still a consistent idea, and there is no eagerness. This is a temporary abnormal state, the result of endless floating. Some have their own industry needs, and replenishing vacancies is mostly the goal. Investors are not lonely, such as Hanji, Tonglirun, Lihua, Jiujing, Hengkang, Xinglian, and Yiyi, all are absorbing at low prices. People's hearts are stable, and the transformation must be very fast. Yesterday's market resulted in a uniform drop of 35 cents to one yuan, with a turnover of about 1.12 million yuan.

### Gold Jewelry Exchange Rate Hanging Low, Purchase Price Pulled Further Apart

Yesterday, the Shanghai goldsmith industry's Daxin peer jewelry gold, the market selling price per tael initially did not see a small hang, still suspended at 2,300 yuan. At 1:00 pm, it was reduced by 50 yuan to 2,250 yuan (while the purchase price was pulled open, it had to be reduced by about 400 yuan). In fact, due to unfavorable rumors in the industry, the supply exceeded demand. The price per tael plummeted from 1,020 yuan to within 2,000 yuan. At noon, it was inferior to 1,940 yuan, a decrease of 100 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 80 yuan. The transaction was not prosperous.

### This Factory is Seeing an Upturn Again

The raw nails of this factory, due to the constant emergence of hoarders a few days ago, caused the market to be full of goods, and the Beisi market once returned from 750 yuan to 700 yuan. At this time, after the hoarders stopped hoarding due to seeing the market atmosphere weak, the foreign company helped retail users to absorb the intention was suddenly strong. Therefore, the minds of the same industry who hold the goods changed with the opportunity, and the shouting price rebounded and supported the market, and the market atmosphere saw a good again. And buyers are still buying in. Therefore, the market price per barrel of Beisi rebounded from 700 yuan to 750 yuan, and the holders are still optimistic.

### Wheat Bran is Still Firm and Popular; Sweet Potato Dried Goods Owners Support

The supply and demand of beans were scarce yesterday, and the market was quiet. Generally, broad beans were slightly tight, and red beans were tired.

### Cigarette Price Limits; Association Requests Authorities to Universally Distribute Goods

In order to suppress the price of goods and reduce the burden of people's livelihood, the authorities will gradually implement price limits and quotas for various goods. It is learned that the Shanghai Special City Cigarette Industry Association yesterday received a notice from the authorities, ordering its members to sell according to the price set by the China Branch Cigarette Cooperative Group. The association immediately complied and published an announcement in various newspapers. Considering that 90% of the members in this city have not joined the Yongtaihe peer, it is difficult to maintain business by selling at this limited price. The association understands the difficulties of its members, so on the one hand, it persuaded members to comply with the law and not exceed the price limit, and on the other hand, it submitted a document to the authorities, requesting permission to universally join the peer so that members can obtain the right to distribute goods in order to continue business and maintain social order. A summary of the price limits of each cigarette is listed below: 10 large British 1 yuan and 8 jiao, 50 large British 8 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen, 10 old knives 1 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen, 10 Pin Hai 1 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, 10 Fairy 1 yuan and 5 fen, 10 Wuhua 1 yuan and 5 fen, 10 Qianmen 2 yuan and 5 fen, 20 Qianmen 4 yuan and 2 jiao, 50 Qianmen 10 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen, 10 small three cannons 3 yuan, 20 small three cannons 5 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, 10 sailors 2 yuan and 8 jiao, 50 officials 10 yuan and 5 jiao, 20 officials 4 yuan and 2 jiao (the above are calculated in central reserve certificates).

### Summer Medicines are Selling Slowly

Summer medicines are still tired and unable to be compared. Sales on various roads are still few and far between, and the buying and selling of hoarders is cold as ice, so the price is not much different. Tiger brand headache powder is 21 yuan, Wan Jin Oil is 19 yuan, Bagua Dan is 17 yuan, Hegu vegetables are 55 yuan, and Longhu brand Rendan is 14 yuan. Only Baifu oil sells well, so the price is still firm, 16 yuan per dozen, and Wudi tooth powder is 10 yuan, all should be calculated in units.

Entertainment World

### "Lang Deshan's Technique"

— Luo Lü

The technical entertainer Lang Deshan is meeting the people of Shanghai again this time with performances at the Great Light Theater. It truly feels like Shanghai residents are getting an ice cream treat in this "boiling over the whole city" hot summer. After all, Shanghai residents have heard of his name for a long time, and who wouldn't want to go and see what it's all about?

This time's performance is in collaboration with the New Myriad Flower Troupe, but the performances are still independent of each other. The so-called collaboration is merely that the Myriad Flower Troupe's orchestra plays along during Lang Deshan's performance.

After the Myriad Flower Troupe's song and dance concluded and a ten-minute break was taken, it was Lang Deshan's turn to come on stage. When the curtain was raised for the second time, the backdrop behind had been changed to an antique-style picture of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, embroidered in white on a large red background. Strong lights shone on it, making it even more beautiful and pleasing to the eye. Mr. Lang Deshan, wearing a traditional Chinese robe, walked cheerfully to the front of the stage, holding the Pan sisters by the hand. The first performance was the Chinese magic trick "Burning Belt Reversal." Although everyone is already accustomed to this type of magic, it still appeared exceptionally brilliant when performed by Mr. Lang. Moreover, the two beauties beside him holding the belt—the Pan sisters—added an extra touch of splendor to Mr. Lang's performance.

After the magic trick, Mr. Lang took off his robe, revealing a short Chinese-style jacket made of white satin embroidered with black silk. He personally directed the technical performance of the "Lang Family Band." The first performance was the "Guangdong Basin" technique. A little girl held two short sticks in her hands, each topped with a constantly spinning basin. While holding these items, she also acted: flipping from a stool to the ground, then crossing her hands and flipping from the ground back onto the stool. She even placed two cups of water on her forehead and flipped backward. She danced for ten minutes, and the basins on the sticks she held in her hands continued to spin without ever falling, earning enthusiastic applause from the audience. The little girl was no more than thirteen or fourteen years old, with a very cute face and two small braids. Her facial expression remained smiling throughout the performance. Following this were performances by a strongman, steel dancing, and so on, interspersed with performances by the Pan sisters.

The acting skills of Pan Yuzhen and Yulan that garnered the most thunderous applause from the audience were the "Diabolo" and "Umbrella Dance." In the diabolo performance, they initially performed separately: throwing up, catching, rolling over their backs, passing under their legs, and other amazing feats. Then, one person spun two diabolos, and two people exchanged diabolos. A foreigner sitting nearby watched with wide eyes, nodding continuously.

Lang Deshan is from northern China (his wife is French), but he has lived abroad for a long time. His Chinese has become somewhat "pidginized." During performances, he mostly uses English for explanations, followed by Mandarin, and occasionally Japanese. The various techniques he has trained are indeed admirable.

Visiting Stage Performers

### Lan Lan's Attitude Towards Life

— Lan Ying

Since Lan Lan was also at Xia Xia's house, I certainly wasn't going to let her go. So, after talking with Xia Xia last time, I talked with Lan Lan for a while.

"Is Mr. Sun in Chongqing? You must miss him a lot!"

"It's alright! You could say I miss him a lot, or you could say I don't miss him much. It's much more meaningful for two people to be apart and do their own things than to be together and do nothing. Originally, 'happiness is in constant work,' isn't it? To be honest, two people who don't get along won't get along even if they're together every day; two people who are meant to be together will be together even if they're on opposite sides of the world. In reality, they'll always be together. Missing or not missing, it's all the same anyway."

"How's your 'Seven Women' coming along?"

"—I'm currently adapting 'Waterloo Bridge,' and it's almost finished."

"You're really capable—writing, acting, directing, you do it all!"

"When there's a shortage of scripts and talent, I feel that people who can write should try to write. The quality of the results doesn't need to be worried about."

She was wearing a suit, supposedly because she had a dance class that day. This made me think about the issue of costumes: "Do you think costumes have a significant relationship with a play?"

"I think the color and texture of costumes can often help actors express a character's personality, although some people think that with excellent acting skills, you don't need to pay attention to whether costumes are beautiful or ugly."

"Do you like managing household affairs?"

"If I can balance both inside and outside the home, that would be best; otherwise, I'd rather act. For me, the stage is more suitable than the family."

"Did you study English Literature at Yenching University?"

"No, it was Psychology. Originally, when I came to Shanghai, I didn't join a theater troupe or engage in dramatic work. It was completely accidental. However, now I feel that psychology is very beneficial for an actor."

She lives on Rue Sapey, but Xia Xia said, "If you want to find her, you can come to my place. She spends more time here than at her own home."

### The Song Drama Troupe Will Perform on Stage the Day After Tomorrow

After Song Dezhu arrived in Shanghai, he was very busy with social engagements. Yesterday, he went out to visit people all day. In the evening, Xu Xiaochu, Chen Chengyin, Huang Xianzhong, and others from the Shanghai Opera School hosted a banquet for him at the New Xianlin Restaurant. Li Hewen, Wang Jinlu, Chu Jinpeng, Ci Shaoquan, Guan Dehan, and several Pingju performers also attended. There was much laughter and lively conversation at the banquet. Song Dezhu frequently urged the guests to drink, claiming that he could drink three pounds of yellow wine without getting drunk, showing his great capacity. It is now scheduled for the 31st to take to the stage, with a performance period of up to two months, it is said.

### Miscellaneous Notes from San Ya Lu

— Li Quan

Following the death of Yan Jupeng, the master of xiaosheng, Cheng Jixian, has also passed away. When Yang Jiaxun (Xiaolou) passed away earlier, it was rumored that Jixian had also passed away one after another. Many newspapers and magazines recorded this. Fortunately, the rumors turned out to be false, and the performer was actually unharmed. Last year, he even came with Xiaobo, and we were able to see Mr. Cheng's skills on the red carpet again. Although he was getting older, his example was there, every gesture and movement was perfect. Jixian was the grandson of the great master Cheng Changgeng. He studied at the Xiaorongchun Opera School as a child and had a friendship with Xiaolou. Later, he worked in Prince Gong's residence and received a fifth-rank official hat, rising to the position of Deputy Director of the Ministry of War. In the early years of the Republic, Yu Zhenting led the Bianqing Society and invited him to join, and he, Xu (Diexian) and Wang (Lengxian) were known as the "Three Immortals." When he came to Shanghai last year, I had the chance to listen to his plays like Gongyinghui and Zhuangyuanpu, and I didn't expect it to be a final farewell. His elder brother, named Shaotang, was an official to the rank of Secretary, receiving the patronage of Li Wenzhong Gong. In the early years of the Republic, he was a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was said to be fluent in four languages.

There are three people who have become lead roles from supporting roles, namely Gao Qingkui, Li Mingyu, and Guan Shengxi. Gao was the father of Sheng Linshou. After becoming famous, he absorbed and integrated various schools and tunes, leading to criticism of impurity. Li came from the Mingshenghe Opera School and took Liu Po (Hongsheng) as his model. Guan was a third-class student of Fu Liancheng. He and Da Yuanshengji were brothers. When Er Yunshi came to Shanghai in the past, he was still a supporting lao sheng. However, his performances were quite energetic. His Sixth Son in Yanmen Pass and Yang Zhaojun in Mu Guiying (singing the beheading scene) were praised by the old opera connoisseurs. Therefore, when he was in Mao Wu's troupe, he had the momentum to overwhelm Sha Shixin. Since returning to Beijing, he has worked harder and leaped to become a second-tier lao sheng. Li Shifang, Zhang Junqiu, and Zhang Eyun all liked to invite him to be their supporting actor. It is hoped that Shengxi can remain humble and diligent so that when he comes to Shanghai again in the future, the people of Shanghai will look at him with new eyes.

Previous reports mentioned the marriage of Ji Yuliang and Li Lihua, which has been debunked by this newspaper. However, this reminds us of her ancestor Li Guifang. Guifang's father was named Yaxian and studied qingyi. Guifang used the stage name "Er Yinzi" in his early years, specializing in xiao sheng. Later, he changed to xiao sheng and became one of Yang Rongsheng's famous disciples. His singing, acting, and appearance were all excellent. He lived in Shanghai for a long time, and Beijing opera performers who came south liked to have him as a supporting actor. His wife, Zhang Shaoquan, is also Li Lihua's mother.

Yang Xiaolou's art was greatly influenced by Yang Rongsheng, but the merit of his Thirty-Six Friends cannot be ignored. Xiaolou was a devout follower of Taoism, which led to his being unfamiliar with martial arts skills. Fortunately, his friends Ru Xijiu, He Peiting, and thirty-four others urged him to practice together every day, so he would not be lazy. There is a martial arts play called Cao Family Tower, also known as Five-Faced Yoke, also called Thirty-Six Friends. The two are in harmony, and it is also clever. Xijiu is the son of the famous qin master Ru Laiqing and the father of Fu Lan; Peiting is the son of martial net He Guishan, both of whom belong to the younger generation of performers.

### A Tour of the Opera School (Part 1)

— Zhi Yu

People cannot have a fulfilling life without art. Art is an essential element for invigorating and elevating people's spirits and thoughts, nurturing and influencing people's temperament and character, and advancing culture to seek human progress. All civilized countries in the world strive to promote art, and the dramas of Germany, France, and Russia are particularly outstanding. Our country has thousands of years of education and has a unique and worthy aspect of drama. Since Dr. Mei Lanfang's tour of Europe, Chinese "xieyi" (freehand) drama has become increasingly popular throughout the world.

The purpose of drama is originally to "change customs" and "correct music and education." However, most of the old-fashioned opera school performers who are tainted with the habits of the pear garden have not taken on this responsibility. The times are progressing, and now we should abandon all prejudices and misunderstandings, actively promote the mission of drama, and raise the value of Chinese drama so that it becomes a valuable art that transforms society, opens up the people's wisdom, and adapts to the times.

The Shanghai Opera School was created based on this principle. They picked up the shortcomings of the old-fashioned opera schools and adopted the strengths of the new-style schools. Although it has only been established for more than two years, the results have been remarkable. They have given 281 public performances, appeared on the screen once, and filmed a "Song of Ancient China."

In order to understand the situation of the opera school in the past two years, I went to the opera school on the morning of the 20th for a tour:

Stepping into the gate, I saw a thick carpet laid on the corridor. There were a dozen boys practicing somersaults, shirtless and sweating. Going up the stairs was a large auditorium. On the walls hung many plaques donated by social celebrities and pear garden performers. I was cordially received by Mr. Guan Hongbin, the director of the school's educational affairs, and we started our conversation in his office:

According to Mr. Guan, "The opera school did not expect to be where it is today when it was founded. After more than two years of hard work, we have finally lived up to our original intentions. At that time, about 400 or 500 people applied after we advertised for enrollment. After rigorous testing, we admitted more than 240 people. Now, most of these more than 240 students have been able to perform on stage. Only twenty or so students have not yet been able to perform, and we will give them a chance to practice on stage in the future."

### The Scenery of the Art World

— Yu

Shanghai Art Theater will be closed for two months starting from August 5th. The Carlton Theater will be sublet to Huayi, and the play "Rujian Shi" written by Hu Tiwei will be staged. After two months, it will return to Shanghai Art Theater, and a great play will be performed for a week. Ticket prices will be raised to ten yuan, it is said.

The Kuguan Theater Troupe organized by Shi Hui, Yingzi, and others has now been merged into the drama group of CZC Entertainment Co., Ltd.

China Travel will enter the Queen's Theater on August 1st. The first play will be "Tears of the Setting Sun" written by Gu Zhongyi.

After "Madame Butterfly," Li Pingqian adapted Wu Yu's stage comedy "Four Sisters." Gong Qiuxia, Chen Qi, Zhang Fan, and Wang Danfeng will play the four sisters.

Wan Cang's new work "Two Generations of Women" will start filming soon. The actors include Yuan Meiyun, Huang He, Yan Hua, etc.

He Zhaozhang's new work "A Match Made in Heaven" will start filming in Factory Two after "White Angel" ends.

Since the Shanghai Opera School has been performing at the renovated stage, the results have been excellent, and the public has given unanimous praise. Due to the hot weather, fearing that the students' physical strength will be insufficient, it has been decided to close for the summer from August 1st. When it is cool in the autumn, the famous performer Huang Guiqiu's "Spring and Autumn Match" will be performed.

### Qin's "Autumn Begonia" Will Be Staged as a Drama

The book "Autumn Begonia" is a masterpiece by the novelist Qin Shouou, and it was published in this newspaper and was very popular. Later, Mr. Qin rewrote the final section, and it has been published as a separate book. It is rumored that a certain leading member of the drama world plans to adapt this book into a script and stage it after the autumn.

Wang Gendi, who dances at the Lido Ballroom, is one of the popular dancers. It has recently been heard that she has found her match and is engaged to a wealthy businessman. The picture on the right is a recent photo of her.

### Good News for Cheng Fans

— Xiao

Cheng Yanqiu's popularity on stage in Huangjin last year was unprecedented. His accurate pronunciation, clear enunciation, and varied tones were able to captivate the audience. "Suo Lin Nang" was especially impressive, and although it was performed for several days in a row, it was always full. Indeed, the addition of ban in the Xipi yuan ban and the addition of crying in the er liu were all original. Coupled with the support of the famous qin master Zhou Changhua, it felt like a perfect combination, adding a lot of color. As the saying goes, the peony is good, but it all depends on the support of the green leaves.

It has recently been heard that "Suo Lin Nang" has been recorded in the old capital. This once-popular play will now be popular throughout Shanghai, and those who cherish Mr. Cheng's artistic tune can enjoy it fully. (However, this is not for compensation)

### Sailing in the Same Storm

— He Jia Zhi

Seven, Thunder

Wei Cheng said: "This meeting is like the Jin Sanye meeting, isn't it?" Mrs. Ye said: "Yes, yes, who did you hear that from?" Wei Cheng said: "When I was studying in my hometown, there was a local history class in school. The local history class mentioned the Jin Sanye meeting, which was a large-scale superstitious movement. Auntie, please continue to tell me." Mrs. Ye II said: "What I'm telling you is all what your mother told me. At that time, their boat was broken in the river channel. The people on the boat suggested going ashore. Anyway, the boat had to go ashore when it reached Daxing Town. Without going ashore, you couldn't see the meeting at all. It is said that when they went ashore, the sky was not very bright, but the shore was already full of dark heads. Your uncle was a leader of the group and rushed to the front, and the rest of the women followed him. When the sky was bright, they arrived in front of the Jin Sanye Temple. Your mother was the first to sound the retreat gong, saying that all there was was people挤来挤去, and if she had known this, she would have been better off sitting on the boat. But no one else was willing to retreat. From dawn to noon, more and more people came. The person in charge of the temple fair suddenly issued an order, saying that anyone who came to see the fair should retreat east to some bridge, west to Daxing Town, and south and north to some other place. In the area around the temple, only those who were participating in the fair were allowed to stand. The people who were watching the fair were not allowed to stay. At that time, the police in yellow uniforms and the people with red cloths tied on their arms were all beating people with rattan whips and sticks. Your uncle's character, you know a little about it. He is very willing to abide by the rules. Hearing that they were supposed to retreat, he squeezed into the crowd and retreated. Wei Cheng, you have to know that these people who came to see the fair came in batches. Although it was crowded, it was still easier to squeeze through. Now, with one retreat, it was like a mountain collapsing, like water gushing up. Some people fell to the ground, some people had their shoes trampled off, and some children and women were crying. Unfortunately, your mother got separated from her sisters and brothers from the same village, and even from your uncle, in this angry tide. Wei Cheng, at that time, it was not easy for women to go out, and going out to see the welcoming god temple fair seemed to be a not-so-legitimate thing, so after your mother was separated from the people who went with her, she was very regretful.
