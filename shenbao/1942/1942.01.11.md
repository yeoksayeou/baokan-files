Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – In the past twenty-four hours, Japanese troops on the Malay Peninsula have advanced fifty miles. Last night, they breached British defenses and reached a point less than two miles from Kuala Lumpur. They are expected to capture this strategically important British base at any moment. This morning, a Japanese river unit advanced.

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a military correspondent in Malaya, Japanese army units that broke through Tanjung Malim advanced approximately fifty miles in twenty-four hours. At 5 PM last night, they approached Kuala Lumpur from the northwest. Other Japanese units continued to attack British positions this morning. It is expected that the two Japanese forces will join up today.

Singapore, 10th (Reuters) – The Japanese are continuing their fierce attacks and appear to be exerting all their strength to force the British defenders to retreat to the city. Casualties are heavy on both sides. Officials have confirmed for the first time that the Japanese are using tanks weighing ten to twelve tons to attack and break through British lines. Japanese infantry are advancing behind them in trucks. However, so far, the heavy tanks have had to travel on major highways. The major difficulty for the British in combat is the lack of air support. While British troops are able to deal with the Japanese advance on the ground, the Japanese advance is made easier when Japanese aircraft arrive to bomb.

Singapore, 10th (Reuters) – A joint British-Indian communique states that fighting is fierce in the Slim River area, and British troops are continuing to withdraw south. Singapore issued alerts twice in the past twenty-four hours, but no bombs fell.

### Kuala Lumpur Architecture

Kuala Lumpur is a prosperous and thriving metropolis in Malaya, second only to Singapore and Penang in importance. It is the capital of Selangor and has many famous buildings. Their grand scale and novel design are truly admirable. The special feature lies in the mixture of Western and Malay architecture. For example, magnificent Western buildings are often topped with Malay mosque-style domes. The yellow spherical pillars stand tall, clearly outlined against the azure sky. The two images here, (above) the Malay Palace, and (below) the Great Mosque, fully express the spirit of the Malay world. Now that the Pacific war has approached these areas, it is hoped that these beautiful buildings will not fall victim to merciless shelling!

### Philippine Islands War Situation: Allied Forces Establish New Defensive Lines Based on Natural Barriers

Washington, 10th (Reuters) – Military sources believe that General MacArthur, the commander of the U.S. forces in the Philippines, may have ordered his troops to withdraw fifteen miles since Sunday to occupy new defensive positions. The communique did not specify the deployment of MacArthur's U.S.-Filipino forces, but a U.S. Army Department spokesman stated that the main new defensive center may be located in a corner of Pampanga province, thirty to thirty-five miles northwest of Corregidor. It is believed that MacArthur is awaiting a full-scale Japanese attack. The majority of U.S. defenders are apparently concentrated in the Bataan Peninsula, south of Pampanga and Zambales provinces, and the island fortress of Corregidor and other islands in Manila Bay. It is widely believed that the area of Subic and the secondary naval base of Olongapo, totaling approximately several hundred square miles, is also under U.S. control. The new U.S. defensive line is situated in a strategic location, with its right flank guarding the swampy mouth of the Pampanga River and its left flank guarding Mount Capotsian. It is believed that the Japanese can attack along a front less than ten miles long. U.S. forces are currently defending the road junction of Layac and Dinalupihan, which has a narrow road leading west to Olongapo and south to the tip of the peninsula opposite Corregidor Island. It is expected that the battle will take place fifteen miles east of the city of Fernando. Subsequently, MacArthur reported that the city was heavily bombed. If the U.S. forces retreat from their newest defensive lines, the defenders of Olongapo will also be forced to withdraw and concentrate on defending the Bataan Peninsula and the fortress of Corregidor.

Washington, 10th (Havas) – The War Department has just issued a battle report stating that yesterday's fighting on the Luzon front was limited to extensive skirmishes and heavy artillery exchanges. Japanese reinforcements are arriving at the front in a steady stream, appearing to be preparing to launch a large-scale offensive on all lines in Luzon. A large number of Japanese ships have been spotted nearby, indicating that the Japanese are attempting to continue landing on the island.

### Japan Launches Offensive Against Dutch East Indies; May Be Realized Sooner or Later

### China Provides Extensive Assistance, Jointly Defending Burma; Agreement Reportedly Reached on Distribution of Military Supplies

Bangkok, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here today, a British military spokesman in Rangoon announced last night that an agreement has now been reached regarding the allocation of Lend-Lease military supplies to Burma. From now on, the British will only receive tank equipment. General Chiang Kai-shek has generously agreed to provide certain U.S. weapons to the British forces in Burma. The number of military supplies required for the British and Chinese war zones has now been estimated. Apart from the gradual improvement of the Malayan war situation, Burma is now recognized as a base for future counterattacks and the center for distributing the military supplies required for the Chinese war zone. During the first attack on Rangoon, in addition to the urgent negotiations conducted between Burma and Chongqing, China, Britain, and the United States also discussed the issue of motor transport. Both China and Burma have obtained a large number of vehicles. Military circles in Rangoon believe that the invasion of Vietnam and the south cannot immediately change the situation in Malaya. To ensure the status of Burma, national defense is being strengthened. Australian troops recently arrived in Malaya and appear to be engaged in a full-scale battle with Japanese troops advancing south.

### Large-Scale Retirement of French Army Generals

Vichy, 9th (Havas) - According to well-informed sources, forty-two French Army generals have retired since January 1st of this year, and it is expected that many more will follow soon. This is a measure decided by Admiral Darlan, Deputy Premier and Minister of National Defense, and is also part of the overall plan to reorganize the post-war French Army. The aim is to make the officer corps, including the General Staff, full of "vigor." In the future, the entire core of the French Army will be greatly reformed according to the planned steps, so that the military organization adapts to the situation created after the armistice. What needs to be understood about this matter is that the French Army originally numbered in the millions. After the Franco-German armistice, it was reduced to 100,000, but its organizational structure and the number of senior officers remained the same, which was very disproportionate. The government now intends to revitalize the army, as the general public often criticized the previous General Staff and senior officer corps, pointing out their lack of command ability. In addition, based on the experience of modern warfare, it has been proven that even senior officers must be physically strong and mentally sound to be competent. The reform of the army was originally the responsibility of the Minister of the Army, but since the current Minister of the Army, General Huntziger, died in a plane crash, there is no Minister of the Army in name. Admiral Darlan, in his capacity as Minister of National Defense, with the full consent of other French authorities, completed this most precise reform, eliminating the crisis that the French Army had suffered materially and especially spiritually since its defeat.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Proposes that Second Landlords Should Obtain Licenses; French Municipal Council Studies Tip Issue; Rent Committee to Operate Next Week

The Shanghai Consular Body received yesterday morning the new by-laws proposed by the Municipal Council. If approved by the Consular Body, the practice of charging tips on rent will be prohibited within the Public Concession. According to a Municipal Council official, "Once these new by-laws are drafted by the Municipal Council, they will be submitted to the Consular Body for approval. According to the Jingbang Land Regulations, any new by-laws must first be approved by the Consular Body before the Municipal Council can enact regulations, handling the relationship between second landlords and subtenants, and prohibiting the collection of tips."

Mediation Will Be Provided in Case of Disputes

At the same time, a member of the French Municipal Council told reporters that the issue of tips is currently being studied by a special committee of the French Municipal Council. Once a decision is made, new regulations will be promulgated for implementation. The Municipal Council does not need the approval of the Consular Body to implement these new regulations within the Concession. Furthermore, in order to take parallel measures with the Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council issued a notice the day before yesterday, announcing the establishment of a Municipal Council Rent Committee to mediate all disputes between landlords and tenants. The notice stated that when landlords and tenants fail to reach a decision through direct negotiations, or when either party is unwilling to resolve the dispute peacefully according to the notice issued by French and German Consuls Magre on the 29th of last month, the Rent Committee may act as a mediator.

Profiteering Actions Will Be Absolutely Suppressed

However, the notice issued by the French Consul-General on the 25th of last month is not applicable to subtenants, hotels, or boarding houses. However, second landlords who profit by subletting surplus rooms must still not violate the spirit of consideration for tenants stated in the notice. The mediation of matters in this regard will be decided separately by the Rent Committee. If direct negotiations between the landlord and tenant fail, they can seek mediation from the Rent Committee. However, if one of the two parties expresses dissatisfaction with the mediation, the committee will handle it according to the request of the other party. In such cases, the committee's actions are limited to cases where the focus of the dispute is on requesting deferred payment or increased rent, or requesting eviction. The notice also specifies that,

Reasons Should Be Given for Deferred Rent Payment

Tenants who are unable to pay rent should notify the landlord in writing within five days after the rent payment date, suggesting a method for reducing or deferring the rent payment. If the two parties fail to reach an agreement, the tenant should, within twenty-five days after the rent payment date, send a letter to the Rent Committee, stating the sufficient reasons why they are unable to pay the rent or unable to pay the full amount of rent on time. After receiving this request, the committee will copy a copy and send it to the landlord concerned. The landlord should submit a written statement to the committee within five days after receiving the letter. If there is no reply, the committee will consider that the landlord has agreed to what is stated in the request for mediation. The Rent Committee may make a decision based on the reports received, or convene the two parties for consultation, or make an immediate judgment. The judgment of the committee is final and cannot be overturned, and is immediately effective. It is said that the Rent Committee is scheduled to start operating on the 20th of this month. The office is located at 80 Rue Massenet. Office hours are from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM.

### Substitute Gasoline for Sale in French Concession

For the convenience of car users, the French Concession Municipal Council has decided to sell substitute gasoline starting from the 15th of this month. The price is set at 22 yuan in French currency per gallon. The point of sale has been designated as the police station gasoline station at 1244 Avenue Joffre. It is understood that this substitute gasoline is a mixture of petroleum, benzene, and alcohol. Its firing power is about 15 to 20 percent lower than gasoline, but it is still usable. However, supply requests are limited to car owners holding a driving permit issued by the authorities.

### Street Vendors Forcefully Sell Japanese Flags; Citizens Should Report

The English "China Press" reports that some street vendors on Avenue Joffre are forcefully selling Japanese flags to servants of residents. Regarding this matter, an official from the Japanese Army Press Department stated that if citizens are harassed or intimidated by these street vendors, they should immediately report to the French police or the Japanese military police.

### Supervision of British and American Enterprises is of a Temporary Nature; Factories Already Closed May Consider Resuming Work; Goods in Factory Warehouses to be Unsealed as Soon as Possible

Industrial enterprises owned by British, American, and other Allied merchants in Shanghai that were not included in the list of enterprises to be supervised announced by the Japanese side on Thursday afternoon will temporarily be allowed to operate. According to the Japanese side, the authorities will not supervise these enterprises unless it is absolutely necessary.

The public misunderstands that the supervision of British and American industries by the Japanese side is under the jurisdiction of the Asian Affairs Board. In fact, the supervision measures are jointly adopted by the various Japanese authorities in the city. Japanese representatives convened a meeting of representatives from more than thirty British and American merchants in Shanghai on Thursday in Shanghai, emphasizing that the supervision and closure of British and American industries by Japan is of a temporary nature. At least two of the factories that have received closure orders have received notices stating that the Japanese side is still considering the possibility of allowing them to resume work. All eighteen factories ordered to be closed by Japan belong to the textile industry, including yarn mills and wool mills. The production of textiles is permitted to be performed by workers. Supervisors have been dispatched by the Japanese authorities to reside in each of the British and American merchant factories permitted to resume work. The supervisors are mainly focused on finance. No unified production plan has been formulated for the factories permitted to continue working, because some of them are permitted to operate at full capacity, while others are operating at less than half capacity. These factories have encountered serious obstacles in the past four weeks due to the Japanese side's actions of seizing and sealing offices and warehouses. Moreover, new goods from some factories were simply transported into the sealed warehouses and could not be sold freely. At the meeting on Thursday, the Japanese representatives promised to unseal the offices and warehouses of the factories permitted to work as quickly as possible, to the greatest extent possible. Many of them were unsealed on the 9th.

### Banks and Pawnshops Will be Allowed to Open Warehouses; Goods Released From Warehouses Subject to Licensing System; Rice Has Already Been Permitted for Expedited Extraction

After requesting that the warehouses of various banks and pawnshops be opened to maintain the flow of goods, it is said that they will be opened as soon as the inspection of the goods stored in each warehouse is completed. In addition, rice related to people's livelihood will be permitted for expedited extraction with a license. Foreign rice that the Municipal Council has issued to various rice shops for retail sales will be allowed to be extracted by Jardine Matheson and the Jardine Engineering Corporation upon obtaining a permit from the authorities. Food rice required by employees of various banks and pawnshops may also be extracted with a license, but the actual amount required by employees of each bank and pawnshop is specified. The complete opening of the warehouses of various banks and pawnshops can be implemented in the short term, but it must be subject to the supervision of the authorities and adopt a licensing system.

### Nine Banks Including HSBC to Resume Cash Payments Tomorrow; Withdrawal Limit Set at 2,000 Yuan

The Shanghai branch of the Tongmeng News Agency reports that the Office of the Japanese Financial Commissioner in Shanghai announced yesterday that, upon the order of the Japanese authorities, the British, American, Dutch, and Belgian banks currently under liquidation are permitted to resume cash payments starting tomorrow (Monday). These banks include: HSBC, Chartered Bank, Citibank, American Express, National City Bank of New York, Netherlands Trading Society, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, and Chase Bank.

Initial Withdrawal Limited to 2,000 Yuan

The maximum withdrawal amount per household is set at 2,000 yuan. This is for the first batch of payments, which also includes funds that have already been withdrawn since the start of the Pacific War. Chase Bank is the only exception, with a maximum cash payment of 1,000 yuan. The second batch of deposits will be paid at the beginning of next week. The method for paying the first batch of accounts for banks not included in the aforementioned list will be determined after liquidation.

Remaining Deposits Transferred to Japanese Banks

As for the remaining deposits that have not been withdrawn, it is expected that they will be transferred from the Allied banks under liquidation to the Japanese banks responsible for liquidation, such as HSBC to Yokohama Specie Bank and Citibank to Mitsubishi Bank. It is not yet known how the Japanese liquidators will handle company deposits, personal or commercial overdrafts, and foreign exchange funds. The Japanese side has probably not started investigating these issues, so there will be no decision for the time being.

Assets of Banks and Pawnshops Have Been Reported

The United Committee of Members of the Banking and Pawnshop Industry Association was ordered to instruct various banks and pawnshops to fill out balance sheets, including total capital, reserve fund deposits (fixed and current), loans (mortgage credit), etc. All banks and pawnshops have now complied with the order and filled out the forms. There are already supervisors for the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China.

### Coal Stockpile Investigation Nearing Completion

In order to thoroughly understand the amount of coal stockpiled in various coal yards and warehouses in the city, the two concession authorities previously dispatched a large number of detectives to various locations (including Pudong, Hongkou, and the French Concession in western Shanghai) for on-site investigations. It is reported that the investigators dispatched by the authorities at the time only instructed them to fill out the forms as required, and to inspect the warehouses to verify whether the quantity of coal stockpiled that they automatically reported was consistent. Most of the coal yards and warehouses have now been investigated separately. The association plans to handle the results of this work in the short term in order to seek better strategies to balance the supply of coal, so it has been actively promoting it in recent days.

### Universal Sale of Rice Starting Tomorrow - Sold in Rotation by Rice Shops - Sales Still Suspended on Sundays and Wednesdays

Following the authorities of the two concessions restricting the business of rice shops, the universal sale of rice will commence tomorrow. The method of dyeing fingers during retail purchases will be implemented starting the day after tomorrow. Details are recorded as follows:

Large-Scale Rice Distribution and Rotational Sales

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, in consultation with the French Concession's Board of Directors, has decided that after the first step of restricting rice shop operations, the second step of allocating a large quantity of foreign rice to various rice shops for universal retail supply will be implemented starting tomorrow (December 12th). The four remaining "white ant" rice shops permitted to exist in the two concessions will be divided into two groups to widely sell rice. The daily list of shops selling rice will be designated by the Municipal Council. The two groups will collect rice from the Municipal Council's Grain Office on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Mondays and Fridays, respectively. The office will notify the rice shops in advance by letter. Upon receiving the letter, the rice shops must complete the payment procedures before noon on the designated date; otherwise, their right to receive rice will be suspended. Therefore, rice shops should pay special attention and avoid negligence, lest they bring trouble upon themselves.

Success Expected in Preventing Crowding

Starting tomorrow, the amount of foreign rice supplied by the Municipal Council to each rice shop will be greatly increased. With over a hundred rice shops universally selling Municipal Council rice daily, the difficulty in purchasing rice may be resolved, and the crowded conditions should gradually disappear. The quantity of foreign rice allocated by the Municipal Council to each rice shop will be designated and notified by the Municipal Council's Grain Office. The previous procedure of automatic application will be abolished. The method of dyeing the fingers of commoners purchasing rice with chemical colors will be tested starting the day after tomorrow (December 13th). The regulations stipulate that the color will be applied to the thumb on Monday, the index finger on Tuesday, the middle finger on Wednesday, the ring finger on Friday, and the little finger on Saturday. Sales will still be suspended on Wednesdays and Sundays. The limit for each person's retail purchase remains at three "sheng," priced at four yuan and one jiao in national currency, and will not be changed.

Sale of Affordable Rice in the Western District

Starting tomorrow (December 12th), affordable rice will be sold publicly at the rice sales point at 3 Jessfield Road. It is reported that all procedures will be handled in the same manner as before, with the quantity limited to three "sheng" per person per day, as stipulated by the Municipal Council, priced at four yuan and one jiao in legal tender. Yesterday, the sales point had already arranged everything at the entrance and used large ropes to cordon off the sidewalk to maintain order.

### Future Attitude of Liddell and Others Regarding Employment

According to Mr. Locke, the former British Director of the Municipal Council, he has decided to take the position of the Civil Service Commission. Mr. Liddell, the former Chairman, stated that he would respond to the Municipal Council within a reasonable timeframe. As for Mr. 思, the former active Director, he declined to comment on whether he would take the position.

### Prohibition of Small Steamed Buns at Pancake Stalls

Local pancake stalls, in addition to making fried dough sticks and pancakes, also sell pan-fried steamed buns and flaky pastries. It has been learned that the Municipal Council, due to the difficulty in supplying flour, has instructed the trade association to cease the production of all non-essential foods for commoners from today onward and to focus on baking pancakes and large steamed buns. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of flour supply and the revocation of business licenses. Therefore, the trade association has notified its members to comply starting yesterday.

### Theft of Copperplate Paper - Both Goods and Thief Recovered

The Xieshen Paper Company at 7 Guanqunfang, Nanjing Road, specializing in Chinese and Western paper, has a warehouse at 213 Baoding Road in Eastern Shanghai. At around 6 AM on the 7th of this month, seventeen boxes of copperplate paper, totaling 135 reams and valued at 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, were stolen from the warehouse. The company reported the theft to the police and offered a reward of 3,000 yuan for the arrest of the perpetrators. Yesterday morning, a man attempted to sell the stolen copperplate paper to the Xiehe Paper Company on Tiantong Road. The Xiehe Paper Company found his behavior suspicious and notified the Xiedian Paper Company, who sent staff to confirm that the paper was indeed the stolen property. They immediately notified the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest the man and recover the goods. The man and the goods were taken to the police station and will be brought to court this morning for prosecution.

### A Bird's-Eye View of Import and Export Trade Before the Outbreak of the Pacific War

— Original Author: John Ahlers (Translation: Bo Ming)

Last month, Thailand remained a major customer of Shanghai's industrial products, as it has been for many months. The city's exports to Thailand this month totaled 6,100,000 yuan, with textiles accounting for 2,000,000 yuan and other textile products accounting for 500,000 yuan. In addition, Thailand purchased large quantities of straw hats, chemicals, glassware and hardware, pottery, electrical appliances, and various materials from Shanghai. Thailand is the most important foreign buyer of finished products from many medium and small-scale industries in the city.

Shanghai's commodity purchases by French Vietnam last month were small, totaling only 2,400,000 yuan, with textiles at 750,000 and flour at 690,000 yuan accounting for the most important parts. The market in Vietnam for sales of Shanghai's industrial products has seen little development.

Shanghai's November imports totaled 22,000,000 gold units, with Vietnam accounting for 1,000,000 gold units and Thailand only 2,000,000 gold units, a small amount. Six-tenths of the goods imported by Shanghai from Vietnam were 　 coal, while rubber imported in that month came from Thailand. The amount of rice shipped from Vietnam and Thailand fell to the lowest record for the year because the rice supplied by the Shanghai Municipal Council was mostly from Burma, shipped to Shanghai via Xianggang.

Goods shipped from the Japanese Empire to Shanghai in November totaled 2,400,000 gold units, with goods shipped from Japan accounting for 1,300,000 gold units. Japan supplies Shanghai with a variety of important items. The highest value items were artificial silk and artificial silk goods, worth more than 1,300,000 gold units, followed by machinery with 140,000 gold units, and vehicles with 140,000 gold units, mostly trains. In addition, Japan supplied hardware, wood products, small amounts of chemicals, porcelain, glassware, office supplies and photographic materials. As for food, Japan supplied Shanghai with dried food, canned food, fruit, fish and wine, totaling 60,000 gold units.

In November, Shanghai also imported supplies worth more than 600,000 units from the Kwantung Leased Territory, the most important of which was vegetable oil and fats worth 340,000 gold units, which is an important food for the urban population that almost entirely depended on Dalian for the supply. There were also 106,500 gold units of seeds and 30 tons of aluminum. Items imported from Taiwan were valued at 50,000 gold units, including Taiwan coal worth 60,000 gold units and some fruits and other foods. Supplies imported from Korea totaled 50,000 gold units, mostly fruits. (To be continued)

Cai Niushe, along with his rogue friends Wang Caijin, Li Yingzhong, Zhang Huishui, etc., indulged in pleasure, spending their days at singing and dancing halls. Recently, Cai fell in love with a dancing girl at the MGM Dance Hall and promised to give her ten watches. However, lacking funds, he conspired with Wang and the others to seek help. They decided to commit a robbery. At around 9 AM the day before yesterday, the four of them, with Wang Caijin concealing a pistol, went to the Good Time Watch Shop at 351 Xinzha Road. Under the pretense of repairing watches, they pulled out the gun to intimidate the staff. Just as they were about to search and rob the shop, the shop assistant activated the alarm bell. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, the thieves abandoned the robbery and fled. At the intersection of Chengdu Road and Shanhai Pass Road, Chinese Constable No. 1074 and Chinese Detective Yang Chengjie arrested Wang Caigao. The other two escaped. A pistol and two bullets were confiscated and brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested a postponement of the hearing for further investigation.

On November 8th last year, at 7:10 PM, just as the Washington Watch Shop at 44 Jing'an Temple Road was closing, four armed robbers broke in, closed the door, and searched the premises. The robbery lasted for a considerable amount of time. More than five hundred valuable Eastern watches, valued at 14,141 yuan, were stolen and the robbers fled. The New Gate Police Station was notified, and an arrest warrant was issued. On December 13th of the same year, New Gate Police Station detectives Zhu Shouling and Wang Runhe, along with investigator Tie Guobin, arrested Tao Yafu, the main culprit in the case, near the Continental Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road. Based on his confession, they arrested his accomplices Lu Yonglin, Dai Jinsheng, and Ni Xiaolong at the Southeast Hotel on Rue Massenet in the French Concession and in the Southern City. Forty-six of the original watches were recovered and separately detained. Yesterday morning, they were also brought to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Dayin described the case and requested a postponement. It was revealed that Tao Yafu and Ni Xiaolong confessed to robbing the shop with Wu Hongfei and Gao Yanling, who are still at large. The judge verified the confessions and ordered the four defendants to be detained for a postponed hearing on the 21st.

Yesterday, the Putuo Police Station, based on reports, arrested several thieves in its jurisdiction and detained them for investigation. It is reported that they have committed numerous gang robberies within the district.

Yesterday afternoon, detectives from the French Police Department separately captured several suspects carrying weapons and suspected of street robbery on 新桥霞飞路 and Huanghe Road.

On October 29th last year, at 10 AM, the home of Jin Renfu, a tea merchant at 30, Lane 77, Nanyang Road, was broken into and valuables worth more than 3,000 yuan were stolen. Qian Xianting, a Chinese detective from the General Patrol Police Station, arrested Wang Xuetang from Shaoxing, also known as "Sandy Eyes." Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi prosecuted him according to the law. Judge Feng sentenced Wang Xuetang to seven years and six months in prison after questioning.

They searched Yang's pants and found the morphine. He was taken to the police station. According to Yang's confession, the morphine was entrusted to him by someone on 居　路 to be delivered to a certain place in the British Concession. After obtaining the confession, the police chief ordered him to be detained and ordered the arrest of his accomplices for further investigation.

### Street Robberies and Petty Theft - Snatching Cigarettes Rampant Outside Dinggong Temple

Recently, in the central district of the Public Concession, in addition to the prevalence of hat-snatching gangs, a new group of criminals specializing in stealing cigarettes has emerged. These people specifically wait near major cigarette wholesale stores, and when apprentices from small cigarette paper stores purchase cigarettes and are on their way back, they take the opportunity to rob them. The Central and Old Gate police stations have recently solved multiple cases of this type of theft. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, an apprentice from the Qinchang Cigarette Paper Store on Madang Road was carrying cigarettes worth several hundred yuan when he was suddenly robbed at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Avenue Edward VII. The apprentice cried in distress, not daring to return to the store. The police arrived and took him to the police station to report the incident.

Spring and Autumn

### Be Careful of Fires, Avoid Coal Poisoning

— Liao Mu

These last few days have been terribly cold, although it will get colder later. The northwest wind at the crossroads is as sharp as a blade, stabbing those who don't wear coats. Even sitting in a "drafty" room, you have to tremble like a hibernating bug.

But it is also the time for "green ant new brewed wine, a small red clay stove," if you have leisure, and it would be even more joyful to sit next to your beloved with fine features. Some people "are very economical," although they don't lack money, the source of white coal is limited after all, so they save on the water heater. - The steam from water heaters is scientifically sound and hygienic, but now using coal stoves is like going backwards in time, troublesome to manage and dirty. But the white iron pipes for the coal gas must be thicker, to avoid difficulty breathing, and be hygienic. If you want to bathe or relieve yourself, you can book a room in a few hotels, where the water heaters are still constantly supplied.

Some young masters and misses hate coal stoves with a vengeance. There is scientific evidence to prove it: it is said that burning coal produces a poisonous gas called carbon monoxide. If there is one part in one hundred thousand in the air, it can make everyone poisoned. If it is above seven parts in one hundred thousand, a healthy person suffocated in it for twenty minutes will die.

Facts are facts after all, and don't become fantasies because young masters and misses hate them. I also gradually recognize that the above statistics are correct. But some people are afraid of the cold but are also lazy. They put the coal stove in an airtight room, and conveniently cut a few slices of radish, and shove them into the stove, thinking that the "disinfection" task is completed. After a few sips of lamb wine, they go to bed. But as a result, I admit that this person is really unlucky to not be able to sleep and to die in bed (this kind of suffocating poisoning causes the poisoned person's blood cells to coagulate, and they struggle painfully to death), which is as ridiculous as stuffing a stinky sock in your nose to prevent mustard gas. However, if they think they can avoid disaster by putting a noble gas mask on with double medicine, certified by the Health Bureau, I think this person also needs to be suffocated. - The filtered air in the small space of the room is definitely not enough.

The newspapers recently published several news reports about coal poisoning. One of the ladies wasn't poisoned while sleeping. She just moved the coal stove into the room to cook, which seemed clever, because the vegetables would cook and she would also be warm. But this also caused the ingenious woman to be poisoned and lose consciousness.

Even if this housewife had knowledge of coal poisoning, this mistake is still possible: people are alive, and if they are suffocated, they can escape. But after being suffocated, they can't move and can "return to the hate of the dog." In addition, Shanghai is now densely populated. In many cases, one apartment is rented to multiple tenants. If a small coal stove is placed in the corridor, it will cause the residents of five or six households to suffer. - This is not an exaggeration. Just investigate the living conditions of the households and you will find that my words are not nonsense.

So how can we avoid coal poisoning? You don't need to prepare gas masks for each person, and you don't need to install an air pumping device in each household. When there is no other way to use a coal stove in the room, the doors and windows must be opened a little, or a piece of glass can be removed from the window.

I don't want to make people live "the whole family in the west wind". Having a home is better than having no home. It's better to die warm than to starve and freeze to death, that's all.

In short, don't be careless. If you are not careful, even the most scientific phonologist Liu Bannong can die from carbon monoxide poisoning in the north. Do you think it's scary or not?

And even people with coal stoves connected to iron pipes should be careful. Haven't you heard that a few days ago, a brothel exploded because the water heater was burning too hot, causing a serious case? As the Buddhists say: "Everything turns to ashes." These good men and women who are happy to be sad can be viewed as such! It also says: "All sentient beings, be careful not to create karma." Amitabha!

### What is Heard is Recorded

— Road Inspector

This road inspector went out on 恺自迩 Road the other day, parked the car briefly, and made an inspection. He saw people on the road discussing things, so he grabbed someone and asked them. The person replied: "A child was crushed in the queue in front of the XX rice store during the sale of affordable rice. Their intestines were broken and they were bleeding. It was a horrible sight." The road inspector then left and went to the store, but found it was quiet and silent. It was already after 4 PM. Details will be investigated further.

### After Viewing "The Plum Blossom Dream"

— Wei Ren

The story of "The Plum Blossom Dream" tells the touching story of Peng Yulin and Mei Xian during the Daoguang years. They grew up together, but after twelve years apart, one was still unmarried, and the other had already married.

Mei Xian is a very ambitious woman. She can forget the murder of her father. She hates the dim-witted court at the time. Her love for Yulin is her hope that he will achieve great things in "revenge and shame", this is the broad love, the love of the masses, the great love! However, because of the circumstances, Yulin did not achieve Mei Xian's ideal. He regretted it for the rest of his life. Later, he lived in seclusion to enjoy his later years with his love of plum blossoms. He built a retreat in West Lake and indulged in poetry and wine with his relative Yu Qu-yuan. There is a saying: "Drunk and mad, writing ten thousand branches of plum blossoms."

The whole play has five acts, the scenery and props are very neat, and the lighting and effects are also quite conscientious.

In terms of the actors, Mei Zhen's aunt, Yu Kuai's Peng servant, Ye Zhen's Mei mother, and Chen Liyun's 都　　were all diligent and conscientious. Leng Shan's 　　藩, his tone was sufficient, but his demeanor was insufficient. Shangguan Yunzhu's previous performance as Mei Xian was mediocre, but her later performance as Yue's daughter was quite naive and lovely. Ge's Mei uncle, Hu Gang's Zhou master, and Tingshan's Gao Renjian, these old men, performed the worst. Sally's Mei maid, 　was too stiff, but she had quite a talent for acting. Finally, I must mention Chou Keng, who played Peng Yulin. I think he was only "　丽" in the first act. In the 　 act, he was at odds with Zeng Guofan, which was his opportunity to exert his strength. And in the fourth act, he lost the focus of the whole play with the old poets and wine. In the last act, the old fellow villagers, although unable to speak, had facial expressions that came from the heart.

"The Plum Blossom Dream" was originally written by Tan Zheng-bi, directed by Fei Mu, with Shen He and 　Keng also contributing a lot of effort in the direction.

Looking Back - Hu Feng

### Better to Return Home!

— Zhang

Shanghai's population has always been the largest in the nation. After the war, people from the interior flocked here, concentrating over five million people in Shanghai, resulting in "more monks than dwellings." On top of the existing structures, attic rooms were built, crammed full, and the streets were bustling with crowds, a flowing tide of people. It seemed that while everywhere else was engulfed in the flames of war, Shanghai alone was a haven of peace.

Analyzing the trend of population concentration in Shanghai, one type is the propertied class who came to avoid the conflict, settling in the concessions as rentiers, fueled by the abnormal prosperity of entertainment venues and the illicit profits from speculative hoarding. These "wealthy refugees" are also part of this group. Another type is those who have lost their homes and livelihoods, and only then made their way to Shanghai. Regardless of gender, they all regard Shanghai as an opportunity for survival, just as people from the interior used to see Shanghai as a treasure trove for gold digging. Those lining up in front of job agencies, running around vocational placement centers, and those already selling their labor, are mostly these "poor refugees" who have survived the war.

Rice prices have risen, and the prices of all goods have soared, like arrows aimed straight at the hearts of the poor and ordinary citizens. Factories have suspended operations, stores have closed, businesses have stagnated, and companies have laid off workers, like sharp axes chopping down on them. They are truly at a loss! There's no place to buy rice, no place to get oil, and their money is dwindling day by day. Shanghai cannot keep them, and they cannot stay in Shanghai.

People will surely think of their hometowns where fields can still be cultivated and houses can still be lived in. Deep down, they will surely experience the sentiment of "better to return home!" According to news reports, 300,000 people have already left Shanghai in recent days. This is a clear indication of the shrinking population of Shanghai. Because of the population decrease, consumption will decrease accordingly, and prices can be expected to fall. Those who have no choice but to stay in the city seem to be able to alleviate their worries somewhat in this situation.

Random Talks on Entertainment

### Ice Games in the North Country

— Zefu

The North Country is cold. Every winter, there are ice games. This game started in the early Qing Dynasty, called "ice games". In the palace, during the second month, in the three seas of the West Garden, when the ice was strong, soldiers were ordered to perform on the ice, as a way to practice martial arts and reward them. The games included "grabbing ranks," "grabbing the ball," and "shooting the ball." In "grabbing ranks," the people lined up two or three miles away from the imperial seat. When the cannon fired, everyone would rush forward, gradually approaching the Emperor. The imperial guards would stop them. The order in which they arrived determined the first and second ranks, hence the name "grabbing ranks," similar to a race on land. In "grabbing the ball," the soldiers were divided into two teams, each forming a line. First, a guard would kick a leather ball forcefully, and everyone would compete to grab it. The team that grabbed it would win. However, it often happened that one team grabbed the ball, and the other team would grab it back, so they would repeatedly lose and grab, much like today's basketball game, except without the basket. In "shooting the ball," a decorated gate was set up in front of the imperial seat, with a ball suspended above called the "celestial ball," and a ball suspended below called the "terrestrial ball." The players were divided into teams to compete in shooting. Each team had one person leading with a small flag, and two people following with bows and arrows, one shooting the celestial ball and one shooting the terrestrial ball. Those who hit the target would be rewarded. Often, one or two hundred people would participate in the game, lining up in order, so they would snake around like a dragon. In addition, there were also "sliding ice mountains." First, water was poured to create an ice mountain, three or four zhang high, incredibly smooth. Brave and strong people would wear shoes made of pig skin, which made them slide even faster. They would slide straight down from the top, and those who did not fall would win. This was also a type of ice game, except that it was not played on the ice of the three seas.

Sixteen, the Fire of Youth

The days flowed by like water, and before I knew it, it was spring again.

Due to the impact of the war, many schools in Shanghai had entered a distorted state. A small school building was often jointly used by two or three schools. The locations were usually in the center of the bustling city, adjacent to the stock exchange or shopping malls. Students' class schedules were usually divided into morning and afternoon sessions, averaging less than one day of class per week, with plenty of free time. At the same time, the entertainment industry in Shanghai was booming, to the point where there was a restaurant every few steps and a dance hall every few more. In this special situation, many young people unintentionally acquired an additional "part-time job" outside of their studies - high-end vagrancy!

These vagrants who had classes in the morning would carry their foreign books and go to dance halls or cinemas in the afternoon. If they were unlucky enough to have classes in the afternoon, then they would have to move their playtime to the evening, but fortunately, they could sleep in the next morning. Although their families found it somewhat displeasing, the parents were busy hoarding goods and buying US dollar notes, so how could they have time to care about their children? Anyway, since they were as rich as Shen Wansan, what did it matter whether their children studied or not?

This trend spread quickly like a contagious disease. Luo Shaohua was also a young man with unsettled blood. Since the environment did not allow him to isolate himself from the rest of the people, he naturally followed the crowd in the end.

However, his mind was still clear. He played, but he was not yet infatuated. It wasn't until the night he met Mei in the Ronghua Sichuan Restaurant that his heart began to feel a little intoxicated. (100)

Commercial News

### Chinese Banks Not Required to Report Deposits: Hearts Put at Ease

There was a previous rumor that Chinese banks would have to report depositors with deposits of over 50,000 yuan, causing concern and unease. It was thought that if the intention was to investigate foreign depositors, then the number of foreign deposits in Chinese banks, although not non-existent, would be limited, as foreigners generally deposit in their own country's banks, which is only natural. Now that these foreign banks have been liquidated, even deposits made in Chinese banks before December 8th must be limited in number, and most likely not by British or Americans. Therefore, the intention to investigate large depositors in Chinese banks seemed to be to cause anxiety and confusion among the general Chinese population, and the purpose of the investigation was unclear. Moreover, people generally trust banks not only because of their financial strength and management, but also because they can fulfill their obligations to depositors. Although reporting depositors may seem insignificant, it still creates a negative impression. It was rumored in the past few days that there was a proposal to waive the requirement to report the names and amounts of depositors in Chinese banks. Yesterday, there were more and more people saying this, suggesting that it might be credible and had been abandoned, which put people's hearts at ease. This is a move that earns a good impression from the public, and the benefits of canceling the reporting requirement far outweigh the benefits of reporting.

The Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry in this city, regarding the collection of out-of-town checks, in addition to having already restored the collection of checks from affiliated banks and firms (as detailed in this newspaper), has also decided to restore the collection of checks from financial institutions other than those affiliated with the committee (i.e., banks, money shops, and trust companies other than those affiliated) starting tomorrow (the 12th), payable to money shops, silver firms, and trust companies. The regulations of the committee are recorded below:

Each affiliated bank or firm should send the checks for collection from financial institutions other than affiliated banks or firms to the committee within the following time: Monday to Saturday, from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM daily. Since the closing time of financial institutions in this city is currently earlier, the committee needs until the next day to collect all the payments for the above checks on behalf of each affiliated bank or firm before crediting them to the accounts. The return of dishonored checks to the collecting bank or firm will also be done the next afternoon. Each affiliated bank or firm should indicate the date of the following day in the deposit slip when sending the above checks to the committee. In order to expedite the receipt of funds by each bank or firm, any such checks received by each bank or firm that have not yet matured should be sent to the committee one day before the maturity date so that payment can be received on the maturity date.

### Gold Prices Bottom Out, Re-entered and Bought

Spot gold in the black market first fell and then suddenly rose, as gold firms took the opportunity to buy at low prices and strongly pushed up the price, breaking through the 11,000 yuan mark and seeing a rebound. People's hearts were shaken and switched from feeling tired to stable. The opening price in the morning for each tael (ten liang) was 150 yuan lower, at 11,100 yuan. At that time, some gold firms and retail investors were seen selling. Subsequently, it fell another 300 yuan, retreating to a low price of 10,800 yuan, at which time it was bought by certain gold firms. Then it started to rise, with Shengda, Yongyu, Taifeng, and securities firms strongly buying, and the price was suddenly raised by 600 yuan to 11,400 yuan. Gold firms and another securities firm sold, Shengda and Yong returned and pushed it down to 11,200 yuan, but gold firms continued to buy. At noon, it rose another 290 yuan, finally reaching 11,450 yuan with buyers, 200 yuan higher than the previous day. The price fluctuated by 650 yuan that day, with a total transaction volume of over 1,000 taels. The initial asking price for jewelry gold by each of the Daxin and other firms was 50 yuan lower per liang, at 1,150 yuan, but later it returned to 1,200 yuan (a decrease of 200 yuan for buying). Silver was quoted at 16 yuan, and the black market price was 11 yuan with buyers, it was said.

The discount rate for remittances and drafts remained at 3 yuan per thousand for both the interest and discount, and the overnight interest rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 6%.

The foreign exchange market slightly strengthened. The British pound and US dollar each rose by 5 yuan, the former to 270 yuan and the latter to 275 yuan. US dollar notes rebounded to 17 yuan, Hong Kong notes also rebounded to 2.70 yuan, and military notes continued to rise to 3.88 yuan.

### Rice Market Gradually Stabilizes, Rice Supply Not Resolved, Rice Panic Difficult to Eliminate

Yesterday, the domestic rice market showed a fluctuating state, and the market was quite stable. The selling prices of rice in the previous and subsequent markets did not show large differences. Although the arrival of rice was more frequent yesterday, the weather was cold and looked like it would snow, so sellers were unwilling to sell cheaply, and buyers had a strong demand yesterday because today is the weekend holiday, so the market was able to hold steady. The total arrival of rice from all routes was estimated to be 250-260 shi, and the sales volume was also close to 300 shi. The market prices were similar to the previous market, except that Yinwu Kun-geng rice was particularly scarce on the way out and the supply was more than the demand, and it seemed weak. High-quality Yinwu rice was only 245 yuan, top-quality Kun-geng rice required 235 yuan, general quality was 228-229 yuan, Southern-produced high-quality Bo-dao rice was 211 yuan to 208-209 yuan, early rice was 208-209 yuan, and foreign-produced Xian rice remained silent as before. However, according to rice merchants, a supply of rice may be realized soon. Since the merger and reorganization of the grain and bean rice industries, efforts have been focused on the transportation and sales of rice. It is said that the transport permits for Du-ke rice from various routes along the Yangtze River have been accommodated by the Japanese military, and there is also a proposal for Yue-Zhe to cooperate further with the Bureau of Public Works to solve the current difficulties. However, the biggest difficulty currently faced by the industry is the inability to turn around frozen funds. Because the industry has supplied millions of gold worth of rice at subsidized prices in the past month, not a single cent has been received, and the Liji and Xiangmao foreign firms in charge have been shirking their responsibilities, making it impossible for the industry to operate and purchase, or even leading to bankruptcy and complete suspension of commercial transport, which is a major hidden danger for the future food supply. It is hoped that the authorities in the concession will make adjustments and provide relief, which would benefit both commercial transport and the people's food supply. If a solution to the problem of rice supply is not found, people will think that after February, the stored rice will be exhausted and there will be a fear of starvation. Although half of the rice shops are currently open, it is still difficult to eliminate the panic and relieve the congestion of buying rice. If each rice shop could receive 60 bags of foreign rice daily to sell, so that those who wait all day would not be unable to buy rice for dinner, that is, everyone would have the opportunity to buy rice for dinner, and they would not have to worry about not having anything, and they would not rush to be the first, be beaten and starved, and fight for these three sheng of rice.

### Trade in Coarse Grains Still Good

Yesterday, retail sales of coarse grains were slightly active, so trade was still good and the market showed a positive trend. Edible oil prices rose by as much as 10 yuan, corn also rose by 1-2 yuan, and soybeans stopped falling and remained stable. It is estimated that 600 dan of Qing oil from the Dada factory were traded, priced at 170 yuan to 180 yuan, 20 buckets of Dada soybean oil were priced at 400 yuan, 50 packages of Tianjin Xin Jinyuan were priced at 109 yuan to 108 yuan, and packages of green beans were priced at 97 yuan to 98 yuan. 100 packages of Wuhu corn were priced at 52 yuan, and 500 packages of new Western corn were priced at 51.5 yuan to 52 yuan at this warehouse, and 54 yuan to 54.5 yuan at the Western warehouse. It is also rumored that there is a wholesale order for Qingdao raw oil coming to Shanghai soon, in a quantity of 17,000 tons.

### Government Bonds Rise Straight Up, Foreign Stocks Mutually Light

The black market price of government bonds continued to rise by more than 2-3 yuan. Currently, the black market price has risen by as much as 12 yuan more than the lowest price. Even during normal times of principal and interest payments, there is no precedent for a continuous rise of more than a week. It is heard that the market is worried about the market opening on Monday, which may cause a reaction. The market is still dominated by Tongshun, Tongyi, Jianyi, and Ruidai buying, and Tongkang, Hongda, Renchang, and retail investors selling. Type A rose from 66.9 yuan to 8 yuan, Type B rose from 63 yuan to 5.3 yuan, Type C rose from 62.5 yuan to 64.1 yuan, Type D rose from 60 yuan to 61 yuan, and Type E rose from 60.4 yuan to 2.4 yuan. All bonds broke through the 60 yuan line and rose straight up in one breath, which cannot be explained by theory. The transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan.

The over-the-counter stock market of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry had even fewer black market transactions, and prices were still uneven. The buyers of Huide were still asking 60 yuan, and the sellers were asking 61 yuan. The buyers of Asia Shipping were already asking as high as 1.5 yuan, and the sellers were asking 10 yuan. The bid-ask price for Shanghai Wool was 5.68 yuan, the bid for Zhongfang was 9.1 yuan, the price of Ewo Cotton Mill had fallen to 25-26 yuan, and the bid-ask price for Langel was 15 yuan and 15.5 yuan. Paper was still 6 yuan, Yeguang's bid price was 12 yuan, and the asking price was 13.5 yuan. Tunchi was strong at 21 yuan, and there were sellers asking 2.1 yuan for Canadian Dans, and there were no other prices.

### Shuangma Yarn Futures Plunge, Breaking Three Levels in a Row

The yarn market is trending weak, and the plunge in Shuangma yarn futures is unique, which is caused by the weakness of people's hearts. However, other yarn prices remain firm, and retail sales are still not bad. Shuangma yarn futures opened 75 yuan lower in the morning, breaking through the 2,000 yuan level to 1,925 yuan. After a while, as those who made profits covered their short positions, the situation became more expensive, rising to 1,950 yuan. At this time, there was a slight struggle, followed by rumors, and the atmosphere suddenly became panicked. There were many sellers on the table, and they gradually declined, breaking through two levels in a row, from 1,900 yuan to 800 yuan. The closing price was only 1,740 yuan, a severe drop of 260 yuan from the previous day. In fact, those holding futures were afraid of losses, and the shorts chased the market, so the market became unsustainable. However, the spot prices on the ground remained as stable as ever. The spot price of 20-count Tiannv was 2,620 yuan to 2,695 yuan, 20-count Shuangma spot was 2,000 yuan, 40-count Tejincheng was 3,435 yuan to 3,450 yuan, 18-count Weinv was 1,965 yuan to 1,970 yuan, 42-count Lanfeng was 4,140 yuan to 4,080 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was 2,350 yuan to 2,325 yuan, 20-count Fengnian was 2,700 yuan, 20-count Lanfeng was 2,560 yuan, and 20-count Hongkuixing was 1,870 yuan, 32 count Jinbaoxing was 3,250 yuan.

The cotton situation had gradually improved, and factory purchases were also starting, but unexpectedly, some yarn factories stopped production, and people's hearts were attacked again.

### Cloth Sales Few and Far Between

The cloth market has seen the market fall due to the plunge in Shuangma yarn futures, and people's hearts are weak. The spot selling prices in the market have also slightly decreased, with coarse and fine cloths falling by 1-2 yuan per piece. The number of transactions is as rare as the stars in the morning. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth traded at 113 yuan, and 11-pound and 9-pound Ewo coarse cloths are still extremely scarce and are said to have sold out.

The Dongbu market was closed for half a day yesterday due to the sixth day of the lunar month, and the market was operating as usual, so there were very few transactions. Both the leading factory orders and Junzi-pique were seen going downstream, but mid-range fine cloths still had actual customer sales and remained strong. For example, 12-pound Feiyu fine cloth traded at 86 yuan, Caiqiu Yanghe at 85.5 yuan, Labo at 85.25 yuan, Wufu at 83.2 yuan, Shibei fine twill at 81.5 yuan, and Lanbianyu at 81.75 yuan, and Wufu at 81.25 yuan. As for the leading fine cloth factory orders, the minimum price closed at 89 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 7.5 jiao per piece from the previous day, while the leading spot was 87 yuan, which was 5 jiao higher. The new minimum price for Four Gentlemen Pique futures was 3.185 yuan, and at the close it rebounded to 3.2 yuan, a decrease of 2 fen per yard, while the spot Pique transformed to be firm and quiet, closing in the evening at 3.115 yuan, an increase of 1 fen.

### The Woolen Fabric Trade Turns Joy to Sorrow

Since the 30th year of the Republic, after inventorying the goods at the end of the year, all large and small businesses in the woolen fabric trade have benefited greatly, with profits reaching 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, which is common. Others, such as 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, or even over one million, are not uncommon, and can be said to have broken all previous records. Unexpectedly, the Pacific War broke out, and all orders, deposits, and foreign exchange outside of what was already shipped were all frozen, and the amount of losses was equal to their profits. Those with large losses reached over one million, and those with small losses were also 100,000 to 200,000. Therefore, most of the woolen fabric trade turned joy into sorrow, and the bonuses that general employees could have received are now also bleak.

### Longan Branches and Pulp Prices Rise Together

Due to the disruption of transportation between Zhangzhou and Xiamen, dried longan branches produced in Zhangzhou have not been replenished for a long time. However, due to domestic sales, the production prices have actually increased. It is heard that the price of longan pulp has exceeded 1,600 yuan, and dried longan branches also require more than 600 yuan.

### Lotus Seeds from Hunan Are Relatively Active

Lotus seeds from Hunan have fallen by over 100 yuan from the previous market price to 450 yuan. The highest price was 660-70 yuan, and the price has fallen by more than one-third overall. However, the recent market is more active through Ningbo sales, and the rest is only scattered. Therefore, the market trend is still soft. Passenger goods from the local lake are priced over 400 yuan, and the market sells for 412 yuan. White transport is more firm due to the lack of goods, with new and good goods quoted at 550 yuan, and old and substandard goods at 350 yuan.

Economic Miscellany

### Sand Boats (2)

From this, it can be seen that the construction of ships varies according to the different sea conditions. Moreover, because at that time sea voyages could not be traced using maps, the voyages themselves had their limitations. Ruan Yuan's Maritime Transport Examination says:

"Guangdong ships can reach Zhangzhou, Zhangzhou ships can reach Ningbo, Ningbo ships can reach Chongming, and Chongming ships can reach Tonghai Taizhou." In the tenth month of the twenty-third year of Kangxi, Emperor Shengzu patrolled the south and crossed the Yangtze River on a sand boat to Zhenjiang, and then the sea ban was lifted. The reopening of the heavy sea ban in the early Qing Dynasty was also related to sand boats. At that time, Western ships were allowed to dock in Macau and Guangzhou, Japanese ships were allowed to dock in Dinghai Ningbo, and Shanghai was not yet a place for foreign trade.

The Shanghai sand boat industry has a long history, but business declined sharply after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire two foreign shipping companies began operating the northern shipping lines. In the Shanghai sand boat industry, there is a distinction between Christian and non-Christian groups. Among the Christian groups, the Zhou, Shen, and Zhu families are the most numerous, especially Zhu Futai. Christian groups are run by Christians. Non-Christian groups include Chen Fengji, Yan Tongchun, and Li Xinji. The sand boat industry has no brands, and they are all named after the largest sand boat they own, such as Futai, Tongchun, etc., all of which are names of sand boats. Futai was a giant in the sand boat industry, and it was sunk at the mouth of Wusong during the Sino-French War in an attempt to prevent French warships from entering.

The number of crew members on sand boats is not uniform, but there is generally one "boss" who is in charge of the entire ship's navigation. There is one "assistant boss", five "anchor and mud" workers, and one "chief citizen" who is in charge of the entry and exit of goods and money, representing the ship's merchant. There are twenty-four "junior clerks" and several "errand boys". Each ship has five masts to spread the sails. When sailing to the outer seas, a gold ingot is added to the top of the mast, and a red flag is raised when entering the port. When the wind is favorable, awnings are added to both sides of the sail, like wings, to help with the wind force. Some businesses own sand boats and specialize in transporting goods to and from the north and south. Those with small capital charter cargo. For Christian sand boats, the crew members are not paid wages, but are mostly paid with 20% of each voyage's income, with the ship's merchant getting 80% and the crew getting 20%, while others are paid wages. As a result, there is private loading of goods to seek "extra income", and the merchant's income is reduced. The old Shanghai silver trade, the 98-rule yuan, originated from the sand boat industry's trade in Kanto beans. I have another article to prove this, so I won't go into details here. Sand boats are equipped with weapons such as guns and cannons to guard against thieves, but the cannons at that time were crude and lacked lead bullets, so they used copper coins instead. They loaded gunpowder and copper coins into the gun barrel, added a fuse to the hole, ignited it with fire, and covered the hole with the sole of a shoe to prevent the gunpowder from escaping upwards and allow it to fire forward. I think that during the Jiaqing reign, Zhang Sicheng defeated the pirate Cai Qian, and Cai Qian's ship was unable to obtain lead bullets and used foreign silver dollars as bullets, and the Qing general Wang Dechun was injured by them. Silver dollars and copper coins could all be used as weapons. Cannons were invented in China, from catapults to cannons. I have been trying to find the traces of their development but have been unable to. Therefore, I have checked and re-examined, and summarized what I have seen to clarify the origin of cannons. This is not within the scope of Economic Miscellany, so I will publish it separately another day. (End)
