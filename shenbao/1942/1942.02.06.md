Singapore, 5th (Reuters) – The artillery battle across the Johore Strait continued day and night. Japanese aircraft resumed their fierce attacks on Singapore yesterday and this morning. According to a British military headquarters communique today, Japanese aircraft attacked again this morning, continuing their tactics of high-altitude bombing and dive-bombing.

The northern part of the island was also bombarded by Japanese artillery. Japanese aircraft continued to bomb and strafe the island. A tanker in the naval base, which had caught fire two days ago, was still burning.

Britain Closely Monitors the Far East Situation

London, 4th (Reuters) – The battles in Singapore, Burma, and Java have attracted intense attention here. With Singapore under siege, human reinforcements and food supplies are crucial factors. However, there is general confidence that adequate air cover will repel any attempts to enter. It is understood that the gap in the causeway has been widened. There are concerns that the use of airfields on Singapore Island will be severely affected by Japanese artillery fire and dive-bombing. There are conflicting opinions among aviation experts as to whether fighter planes can use the secret airfields in the Dutch East Indies within 150 miles of Singapore to provide air cover. Furthermore, the Japanese blitz on Rangoon and their rapid advance in Burma are undoubtedly driven by their desire to complete the occupation of Rangoon before the Allied forces can consolidate their position in Burma. It is reported that a large Japanese force attempting to cross the Salween River has already ××. With the battle line extending 45 miles along the river, their strategy in Burma is to achieve the following objectives:
    To close the Burma Road at its entrance, thereby cutting off China's supply line.
    To establish a strong position deep in Burma to gain a foothold in the Indian Ocean.
    To prepare for a combined naval and air blockade and continue the land offensive to counter China's offensive from the north.
Well-informed Dutch sources here offer the following explanation for the Japanese bombing and fighter attacks on Surabaya: They believe it is:
    The start of a direct attack on Java.
    An attempt to destroy the Allied air bases in Java used by the Allied forces.
    An attempt to destroy the naval base facilities in Surabaya. Surabaya is the only Allied base in the Southwest Pacific that can replace Singapore. Darwin is too far away. It is generally believed that the next Japanese target will be the occupation of Timor, it is said.

Once Singapore falls, Japanese submarines will take precedence. Although the gateway to the Indian Ocean will then be open, the Japanese Air Force will only be able to provide naval support in the Bay of Bengal due to the vastness of the Indian Ocean. Therefore, the Japanese can only utilize the vast space of the Indian Ocean to obstruct enemy lines of communication. In addition, the water in the Indian Ocean is clear, and the number of enemy warships is small, so the Japanese submarines will easily complete their mission, it is said.

### Arbitrary Dismissal Arbitrated by the French Concession Police to Comply with the Population Dispersion Plan; Returning Home Certificates Issued to Dismissed Workers

The Municipal Council is sparing no effort in dispersing the residents of the Wood District. Since yesterday, after adding three more offices for issuing Returning Home Certificates, there are now a total of eight offices in the Public Concession where Returning Home Certificates and half-price train and bus discount coupons can be issued. Recently, due to the cold weather and continuous rain, the number of people leaving Shanghai has decreased. Also, the number of people going to the offices set up by the Municipal Council to collect Returning Home Certificates is not as large as it was a few days ago. However, more than 4,000 Returning Home Certificates are still being issued every day.

Half-Price Discount Deadline Approaching

The General Issuing Office of the Municipal Council Volunteer Corps issued a total of 1,181 Returning Home Certificates and 856 half-price coupons yesterday. As for the other seven branch offices, each issued an average of about 400 Returning Home Certificates and about 300 half-price discount coupons yesterday. Therefore, the total number of Returning Home Certificates issued by the eight offices yesterday is estimated to be more than 4,000. It is expected that the number of people going to collect certificates will double after the weather clears up. Moreover, the end of the lunar year is approaching, and the issuance of half-price train and bus discount coupons will also end at the end of the lunar year. All those who want to return to their hometowns will rush to collect Returning Home Certificates and discount coupons before the end of the year. Therefore, the crowds collecting certificates will be very crowded in the next ten days. The offices issuing Returning Home Certificates can also help those who are illiterate to fill out the forms. If applicants can fill out the forms themselves, it will be more convenient and will not take too much time.

Settlement of the Dismissal at the Yixing Silk Factory

The Yixing Silk Reeling Factory at No. 6 West Yiyi Road announced its closure in the middle of last month due to poor business. In addition to providing severance pay to most of the workers and sending them back to their hometowns, the factory also dismissed 17 people, including Hua Huosheng and Chen Qiaosheng. The labor and management sides failed to reach an agreement on the dismissal conditions, so the Political Department of the French Concession Police summoned them for mediation, but to no avail. The Political Department authorities, considering that the stalemate conflicted with the population dispersion plan, specially ruled on the following measures: those who have worked for less than one year will be given a dismissal payment of 300 yuan; those who have worked for more than one year will be given a dismissal payment of 350 yuan; the factory will not pursue the workers' previous loans (60 yuan per person). The labor and management sides have accepted this ruling and agreed that the factory will additionally give each worker 30 yuan as a New Year's Eve meal fee and a subsidy for the period of suspended meals. The agreement was signed and resolved in the Political Department yesterday, and the workers received their Returning Home Certificates. It is reported that the French Political Department will use this method to resolve other dismissal disputes in silk factories. Also, the dismissal dispute at the Jinhua Silk Reeling Factory on Ladu Road has been resolved through mediation. It is reported that in addition to canceling outstanding debts, each worker was given a dismissal payment of 270 yuan.

### 5 Million Yuan of Damaged Banknotes Recovered

Since the Provisional Joint Committee of the Banking Association began its crackdown on those who illegally profit from damaged banknotes, it has recovered 5 million yuan of damaged banknotes. At the same time, small shops, public vehicles, and even some large companies in this city still refuse to accept damaged banknotes. Regarding this point, the Municipal Council stated yesterday that the authorities have no legal means to abruptly end this situation. In order to cope with this situation, the Joint Committee has urged the public to cooperate with banks to accept banknotes that are not severely damaged, as it is quite difficult to print new banknotes due to the high cost of paper and printing. The Joint Committee also announced that it directly accepts damaged banknotes from depositors, but it does not accept individuals who only exchange damaged banknotes for new ones, because the procedure for exchanging damaged banknotes for new ones is cumbersome, and there is a shortage of manpower. Therefore, individuals who want to exchange damaged banknotes for new ones should go to any commercial bank, and the banks will transfer the damaged banknotes to the Joint Committee for bulk exchange.

### Gambling Den Cracked in North Fujian Road, Lao Zha Gate

### Concealed Remittance in Hat; Encountered Robbery

Fu Baoxian, a 15-year-old from Shaoxing, is an apprentice at Shen Tai Rice Shop, No. 590 Beiler Road, French Concession. At around 5:00 pm the day before yesterday, he was ordered by his boss to carry a 500 yuan check from Dechengren Bank and 60 yuan in cash to the bank for remittance. He was deeply afraid that the money would be stolen from his pocket, so he hid the money in the velvet hat he was wearing. Unexpectedly, when he took a tram from Songshan Road to West Xinxiaoqiao Street, his hat was suddenly snatched away by Tong Rujun (34 years old) from Ningbo. Fortunately, Wu Lianrong, a detective of the French Concession Police, passed by the area and arrested Tong. However, the stolen money had been handed over to his accomplices and could not be recovered.

### Auspicious Signs at the Death of Mother Pan

Mother Pan, Madam Zhu, was a devout Buddhist in her early years and converted to Master Yinguang. Recently, her old asthma problem recurred, but it was not very serious. However, her mind was occasionally confused. On the morning of the third day, she suddenly claimed to see white light. Her family was not surprised. At 4:45 pm, she said to her son Gengsheng, "I am going to die. I will not live until dusk," but she comforted him. A little later, she said to those who were attending to her, "Why don't you recite Amitabha Buddha?" So they recited the Buddha together. At that time, her pulse was normal and her mind was clear. At around 5:20 pm, her pulse suddenly stopped, and she passed away in the sound of the Buddha's name without any suffering. Her head was warm at the time of death, and she lived to be 75 years old. Her second daughter-in-law came from her hometown and did not know that her mother-in-law was ill. The people in the family also did not know that she was coming. Madam Zhu suddenly said to her grandson, "Your mother is already downstairs. Why don't you go and greet her?" The family was surprised that she was delirious. Before long, she actually arrived. This happened the night before she passed away.

### Thriving Bond Market; Dark Market Sets New Records

The over-the-counter bond market continued to thrive yesterday, with unanimous optimism. Types B and D both surpassed the closing price of December 6, and Type C approached 70 yuan. In this environment, this very abnormal development, although a local good phenomenon, is also a sign that the commercial future is gradually turning around. Since the announcement of the British and American loans, the bond market has received strong support, making it as stable as a rock. Type C is about to reach 70 yuan, which is about to be realized. It is reported that the Chongqing bond market is even 10 yuan higher than Shanghai, so the bond market still has room for continued gains. Type C opened at 69 yuan, rose to 9.3 yuan, and after a competition, the small price once reached 8.8 yuan, but still reached 9.3 yuan at the close, which shows the direction of people's hearts. Shuntai still had a strong appetite in the market, and Dingyu and Dazhong also entered strongly, while Tongxing, Tongkang, and Zhenkang were slightly lower to 2.8 yuan, and the close was still 3 yuan. Type B immediately broke through the 70 yuan mark at the opening, at 0.01 yuan, and the highest at the close was 0.05 yuan, another new over-the-counter record. Type D opened at 64.8 yuan and closed at a maximum price of 5.3 yuan, another new over-the-counter record. Type E opened at 67 yuan, rose to 7.4 yuan, and closed at 7.2 yuan.

### Depleted Chips; Gold Prices Rise Again

Yesterday's cash gold over-the-counter market suddenly rebounded after a fall, and has risen close to the 12,000 yuan mark. Securities firms and gold shops have a strong appetite. Moreover, the city's chips are depleted. As soon as there are buyers, the price easily rises. People's hearts are stable. In the morning, each bar (10 taels) was purchased by the Nanjing gang, Yongfengyu, and a certain gold shop for a total of 50 taels. The opening price was 11,800 yuan, which is 70 yuan higher. Two gold shops and Hefalai in the financial community sold, and Yongfengyu came out again, and the momentum turned weak and soft, falling by 230 yuan to 11,570 yuan. Chengji and Tongkang Yongyin Gold Shop came to buy, and customers of a certain gold shop rose up to absorb it. The rise was even stronger at noon. The final transaction price at noon was 11,950 yuan, which was 220 yuan higher than the previous day, and it has risen for five consecutive days, a total increase of 1,140 yuan. After the close, a certain gold shop sold at 11,930 yuan without buyers. The high and low on that day was 380 yuan, and the transaction was not strong. The price of jewelry gold was still 1,250 yuan per tael for Daxin and other peers, and the purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn's Popularity is Excited

The cotton yarn market is increasingly rising, because cloth is gradually rising, which makes people's hearts firm. At the same time, gold is rising again, so buyers are even more excited. Therefore, Shuangma factory receipts are slowly moving forward. The 20-count Shuangma factory receipt opened in the morning at 1,540 yuan, and then due to active buyers, it finally traded at 1,600 yuan, but there were very few sellers, and some people wanted to buy even with an increase of 20 yuan, which is 100 yuan higher than the previous day. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 4,220 yuan, and the factory receipt was 4,100 yuan. 32-count Xiantao was 3,500 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix was 2,500 yuan, and the factory receipt was 2,450 yuan. 20-count Yueqin was 2,400 yuan, and the factory receipt price was 2,350 yuan. 20-count Tiannv was 2,680 yuan, and 16-count Hongkui star was 1,800 yuan.

Asking prices are as before. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth is 119 yuan, Shuangxiang is 115 yuan, 11-pound is 81.5 yuan, and Yunbang cloth is 72 yuan. All are only available at the asking price. 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth is 94.5 yuan, and Fugui fine cloth is 91.5 yuan. A dozen packages were traded in this street.

East Cloth Yesterday, because dyeing and button and New Ideas transactions were active in this street, the market's buying momentum was strong, and the rising trend was very strong. The factory receipt price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth has exceeded the spot goods, starting from 91 yuan to 92.75 yuan, a sharp increase of 2.25 yuan per piece. Middle-grade Feiyu, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and Laba also rose by about 2 yuan per piece. Peers' buying interest is strong, and the goods are tight.

Woolen Fabric The production of local factory goods is also sparse, because it is affected by the lack of raw materials. However, although the current sales are very sparse and the transactions of various goods are limited, the market is gradually firmer than it was ten days ago.

### Tianjin Peach Meat Opens at 500 Yuan

Shangzhuang peach meat sells for 520 yuan. Walnuts such as hand-picked peaches sell for 240-250 yuan, and southern peaches sell for 160 yuan, both rising by 10-20 yuan. The market is strong.

### How Can We Bear to Drive Them into a Land of Cold and Hunger?

— Jin Yi

The market is sluggish, and layoffs in various companies and firms are an inevitable consequence, like "the sky is about to rain." However, "how to lay off" and "in what manner to lay off" should be carefully considered by the authorities to leave some room for these pitiful employees.

A friend of mine was recently laid off (severance pay is still under negotiation). According to him, five out of ten colleagues were laid off, but the sum of their salaries is less than three tenths of the total. This is because those laid off are all junior staff.

An employee's position in an organization naturally has historical and positional aspects. However, those who are "elderly and virtuous," that is, employees in higher positions, have significant connections in terms of human relations and business. Junior staff, in normal times, indeed occupy important and demanding roles. At that time, they cannot be seen as "redundant staff." For the sake of business convenience, perhaps even a few trainees would be added during this transition. However, at this time, everyone is very idle, so being included in the list of layoffs is an unavoidable tragedy!

However, if memory serves, when the cost of living at sea was gradually increasing, there was a dispute over the issue of salary increases: the authorities often used a percentage increase as a principle. This was naturally unsatisfactory to the general junior staff, because for someone with a monthly salary of one hundred yuan, a 30% increase is thirty yuan, while trainees earning only twenty yuan a month would only get six yuan. If the monthly salary is over five hundred yuan, the amount added would be more than half a year's work for the trainees! Later, a universal increase in subsidies was to make up for this deficiency.

Now is the most difficult period. It is truly fortunate if everyone can work together to overcome the difficulties. When it is absolutely necessary to shrink the scope, such as in the case of my friend's organization where half of the staff were laid off but only 30% of the expenses were reduced (this is just an example, not a general situation), it may be possible to follow the principle of salary increases and reduce everyone's salary by 10% or 20%. The sum of these reductions might be able to offset the 30%. This would not be a big problem for those with higher monthly incomes, but it would save junior staff from being drawn into the vortex of unemployment. This is inevitably a fantasy; whether it can be implemented depends on the circumstances of each organization. As for when it is absolutely necessary to lay off, the issue of severance pay should also be carefully considered. As a member of an organization, they have at least made some contributions. How can we bear to drive them into a land of cold and hunger!

### After Reading the "Yearbook"

— Sha Ding

I saw the ×× Yearbook at a friend's place. It was splendid and magnificent, and the paper was of high quality. In terms of decoration, it couldn't be more beautiful.

Let me briefly explain the above two adjectives to show the extraordinary nature of this book. First, the cover is "stiff," and when you flick it with your finger, it makes a "pop" sound, like two thin layers of plywood. It is covered with gold aluminum foil, which is shiny and smooth, making people love it. After the cover, there is another "defense line," which is a layer of translucent paper, undoubtedly to protect the "golden" color. To use a more literary phrase, the overall effect is quite like "viewing flowers in the fog."

Secondly, regarding the content, in terms of material aspects, the paper includes wood grain cover paper, coated paper, Daolin paper, transparent paper, and sub-Daolin paper, etc. The only thing missing is the cheapest newspaper paper. If there were no text, it would resemble the paper "samples" taken from a paper store or printing shop. The printing and copperplate illustrations are exquisite, and it is obvious that they come from a very sophisticated printing shop, needless to say.

There is no need to talk about the materials and editing here, because yearbooks are ever-changing and are nothing more than that set of things. After spending five or six years, everyone has such a book about the school, classmates, family, and friends, a "perfect expression" of the most memorable and worthwhile period of a person's life. The so-called human nature is originally nothing to be critical of. Moreover, this is done by the girls of a very famous and luxurious girls' school in Shanghai.

After reading such a beautiful yearbook, it seems that I have to have a few thoughts: 1. In this year when human and material resources are so precious, it is amazing that such a publication can be produced, which shows that the daughters of the so-called upper social class have not experienced the meaning of the words "difficult times," let alone hope to share awareness. 2. I don't know how many young men and women of school age in Shanghai are secretly shedding tears of sadness because they do not have the means to study—I heard that the number of applicants for the Shenbao scholarship this time is as high as several thousand. To be able to study in such a luxurious school is truly "predestined from a previous life." If we can take the opportunity to save money and help the unfortunate students in need, wouldn't that be even sweeter and more fulfilling?

I hope everyone will do something most valuable and most memorable. Helping others, helping those who are most in need, should be the responsibility of those of us who are in a "better environment."

### Stage and Screen

— Tai Xu

In addition to reporting the sad news of Wang Cilong's death, Wang Yuanlong also sent a letter to the Guolian Company. Hong Kong filmmakers such as Jin Yan, Gao Zhanfei, Wu Yonggang, and Wang Naidong all attached notes reporting their safety. However, all of the Guolian Company's copies and negatives were burned, resulting in considerable losses. Some works, such as "Peacock Flies Southeast," no longer have copies at the Shanghai General Factory.

"The portrayal of Wang Xiahesheng has arrived in Shanghai and will be giving a three-day calligraphy demonstration at Zhang Garden starting the day after tomorrow."

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

17. Homecoming

Begonia listened and did not answer for a long time. It wasn't that he had nothing to say, but that he couldn't catch his breath. Seeing this, Mei Bao naturally felt more anxious. "Dad, how do you feel? Should I go get that doctor right away?" She was already in a panic. "No, ... it's okay ..." Begonia quickly shook his head, expressing his firm opposition.

Mei Bao didn't know what to do, so she quietly went downstairs and brought up Father Han and his daughter. At this time, Begonia couldn't hear their movements very clearly, until Old Han called him a few times before he woke up again.

"Mei Bao, we can't go out again tonight!" Old Han said, also looking very flustered.

But Begonia heard this sentence.

"Han ... Brother Han ...," he said with great effort, turning his tired eyes. "Today ... you ... you should ... go ... I beg ... you ... to take another look ... for ... me!"

Hearing these words, Mei Bao naturally didn't understand what they meant, but Old Han immediately smiled knowingly. (326)

### The Story of Setting the Clock Ahead

— Xing Hua

I have a relative who is still in junior high school. Classes start at eight o'clock in the morning, but because he is reluctant to leave the warm bed, he doesn't get up until about seven-thirty. Then he hurriedly eats breakfast and rushes to school, taking two steps at a time. As a result, he is late two out of three days. Later, his older brother secretly set his clock ahead by fifteen minutes, and sure enough, he was late less often. But after a few days, the secret was discovered. The next morning, when he saw the hour hand pointing to seven-thirty, he thought, "This clock is fifteen minutes fast." That day, he was late again. So his brother set the clock ahead another fifteen minutes. Later, he found out again. In this way, the clock in his room was set more than two hours ahead of the general time.

Regarding the current "daylight saving time," I hope we don't copy the above story. When you see the hour hand pointing to the time you should get up, don't think, "This is the new time!"
