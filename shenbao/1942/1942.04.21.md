### Pétain Broadcasts to the Nation: Participating in the New European Organization; Laval States He Will Overcome Difficulties and Personally Go to Paris for Important Discussions

Vichy, 19th (Havas) - Marshal Pétain delivered a radio address to the nation at 8 PM today, explaining the significance of appointing Laval as the head of government. He stated, "Compatriots, the new government has been established. Admiral Darlan remains my successor and will be responsible for defending our mainland and imperial territories. Laval, under my leadership, will handle our domestic and foreign affairs. When our country was defeated, the internal and external situation was extremely serious. At that time, I planned a new order with Mr. Laval to ensure France's early recovery. Now, the situation is no different from June 1940. Therefore, I am collaborating with Laval again to overcome difficulties together and participate in the organization of the new Europe. Compatriots, your wisdom, patience, and patriotism will help us overcome all difficulties and suffering. I sincerely hope that the people of the country can trust the government so that we can have reasons to establish confidence and hope."

Vichy, 19th (Havas) - Head of Government Laval will deliver a radio address to the nation at 8 PM on the 20th (5 AM on the 21st, Shanghai time). In addition, General Jannequin has been appointed as Minister of Aviation (State Councilor).

Vichy, 19th (Havas) - Head of Government Laval received reporters in the morning. When asked about his impressions after taking office, Laval replied, "I have been appointed as Prime Minister by order of Marshal Pétain." During the past few days of political turmoil, the Marshal warmly welcomed me into the government, which moved me deeply. He has resolved many difficulties. This morning, I took office and deeply felt the weight and importance of my responsibilities. Fortunately, the Marshal has a clear understanding of the situation we are currently facing, and I have benefited greatly from his guidance. Although the Marshal has entrusted me with the important task of handling domestic and foreign affairs this time, some newspapers and radio stations yesterday claimed that this means the Marshal has given up his power, which is absurd. As the head of the government, I am still subject to the Marshal's control. I need the Marshal to exercise his power to complete my mission. In short, I have unlimited courage for this difficult task, but for success, I must have the Marshal's wisdom and experience to assist me."

Paris, 19th (Havas) - After Count Brinon was appointed as an aide to the Head of Government's office, he told reporters here that he remains the French government's special envoy to the occupied zone, handling diplomatic affairs. As for the position of Rear Admiral Bellanger, he will be the liaison between the government and the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This arrangement is most appropriate because not only does Head of Government Laval want to maintain close contact with the Army, Navy, and Air Force, but Marshal Pétain also wants to maintain regular contact with the generals. Former Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Bouthillier will also take up an important position. The authority of Dr. Ménétrel, the current chief medical officer of the Head of Government's office, is to coordinate the activities of the various ministers. Sports Director Colonel Pascot is a famous athlete and football player. Aide Méssine will continue to handle Franco-German relations. The "Armistice" Affairs Bureau, originally under the Ministry of War, will be transferred to the Head of Government's office. In addition, Head of Government Laval will frequently come to Paris for important discussions.

Laval Formally Takes Office; French Government Remains in Vichy

Vichy, 20th (Domei) - The Vichy cabinet meeting is scheduled to be held at 5:30 PM today, at which time the new head of government, Laval, will lead the new cabinet members to meet with Marshal Pétain. In the evening, after announcing the policy direction, Laval will rush to Paris and return to Vichy tomorrow night.

Vichy, 19th (Havas) - The new head of government, Laval, went to the Prime Minister's office in the Parc Hotel this morning to take office and then met with Marshal Pétain for a long conversation. He also requested the Marshal to appoint former Police Chief Ribeaud as the Prefect of the Rhône Delta (which includes Marseilles, the largest city in the free zone of France). Other appointments and proposals will be submitted to Marshal Pétain this afternoon. In the afternoon, Head of Government Laval also met with Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, for a long time, and it is expected that the two men's views will be completely aligned.

Vichy, 20th (Domei) - The new French government began working on the second floor of the Parc Hotel yesterday. At the same time, Laval made his first official visit to Pétain after taking office, discussing in detail the future policies of the French government. It is heard that Laval suggested to Pétain that Police Chief Ribeaud replace Bonnafous, the former Prefect of the Rhône region who has been appointed as a minister. Yesterday afternoon, Laval continued to make several suggestions to Pétain, the contents of which are unknown. During Laval's long talk with Darlan, the two sides reached an agreement on the future tasks of the new government.

Paris, 20th (Havas) - "Le Journal" recently reported that French Head of Government Laval and Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, although working in Vichy, will frequently come to Paris for important discussions. At that time, Head of Government Laval plans to reside in the former Prime Minister's office, the Matignon Palace, while Admiral Darlan will reside in the former presidential palace.

Vichy, 20th (Domei) - It is learned from Guan Wan that the French government is currently still stationed in Vichy, and the rumors circulating outside are completely inaccurate. The new head of government, Laval, is now also serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs. For the convenience of performing his duties, he must remain in Vichy. The new cabinet list includes Brinon, Bellanger, and Méssine, all of whom are Laval's confidants. In addition, Barnaud, the General Representative for Franco-German economic relations, is still in his original position. It is reported that Brinon and Méssine will be stationed in Paris and will only come to Vichy to attend cabinet meetings every week.

### Germany Holds a Reserved Attitude; Britain is Closely Watching

Swiss Capital, 19th (Havas) - According to reports, after the establishment of the new French cabinet, Germany has adopted a reserved attitude, while Britain is closely watching. According to a Swiss newspaper, semi-official sources in Berlin believe that the new French cabinet will not be obstructed by Germany in the future because Germany deeply believes that Laval intends to build a sound France as the foundation for building a new European order. However, German political circles believe that the issue of French prisoners of war has nothing to do with the French cabinet reshuffle. Laval's responsibilities are heavy, and Germany does not want to obstruct his actions but wants to see his actual work before expressing its opinions. As for the severance of diplomatic relations between the United States and France, the possibility is less than expected. As for London, after receiving the latest news from France, the general mood has calmed down. Most newspapers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. According to the "Journal de Genève," the British side believes that Laval will not overturn the foreign policy formulated by General Pétain a few months ago. On the contrary, he will strive to make the government's actions align with Marshal Pétain's policies. The current French political situation cannot be compared to a body with a replaced head. Rather than saying it is a replaced head, it is more like a new combination of the head and face with the limbs of the body. Laval's resurgence is not due to pressure from Berlin but rather to Marshal Pétain's own initiative to improve Franco-German relations.

Connally Advocates Occupying French Territories

Washington, 20th (Reuters) - Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared yesterday that if Laval attacks the Free French and British forces in Syria, then he advocates that the United States occupy Martinique, French Guiana, and Guadeloupe. If Laval does this, what is his true intention? We will never be deceived.

Lisbon, 20th (Domei) - "Diário de Notícias" published a telegram from Cape Town stating that the living conditions in Madagascar are not much different from before the war. There is a slight shortage of some goods. The British are still residing on the island, but they are slightly restricted, but the general feeling is still comfortable. Due to the lack of warehouses to store sugar, the French governor has requisitioned factory buildings and cinemas. At the same time, the products produced there are piled up like mountains because they cannot be exported. This news was transmitted to Cape Town by a ship sailing between Madagascar and Beira, Portuguese East Africa. Letters sent by the United States to the American consul in Madagascar are also sent via this route.

### "Normandie" Suffers Another Mishap

New York, 20th (Havas) - The French liner "Normandie," which is moored in New York Harbor and has previously had an accident, caught fire again yesterday and burned for five hours before it could be extinguished. However, on the surface, the ship did not suffer major damage, and only one firefighter was seriously injured. According to a report submitted by the investigation committee three days ago after investigating the incident, the cause of the first accident was not due to destructive actions but rather to internal mismanagement, lack of adjustment, and negligence of duty by the staff.

### The Northern Section of the Eastern Front Thaws; Soviet Offensive Obstructed; Malta Again Bombed

Berlin, 19th (Havas) - German military officials recently said that the northern section of the eastern front is thawing, and the floods have forced the enemy to abandon some positions. Under the cover of tank forces, the Red Army has launched several offensives, but each time it has been severely damaged and retreated. After several days of silence on the front line near Leningrad, the Red Army again launched an offensive against us under the cover of air force and artillery, but all were repelled by the German vanguard. Although the enemy stubbornly resisted in some strongholds, they were eventually broken through, and our army took advantage of the situation to occupy a few positions. There were no major battles on the southern route. The Red Army's several offensives failed, and it had to abandon some positions due to the water. Slovak troops participated in the fighting, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Romanian troops also fought well against the Red Army. The German Air Force has been quite active recently. On the northern route, seven enemy planes were shot down, and 15 enemy ships (including eight oil tankers) were sunk in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans last week. In this battle, our navy and air force were quite effective.

### Curtin Writes to MacArthur; Australian Troops to Be Placed Under His Control; Southwest Pacific Headquarters Established in Melbourne; New Zealand's Affiliation Not Yet Explained

Melbourne, 20th (Reuters) - The U.S. Army Headquarters in Australia announced last night that the Supreme Headquarters of the Southwest Pacific has been formally established at 2 PM on the 19th (Greenwich Standard Time, equal to 9 PM Shanghai time) in accordance with the agreement of the Allied nations. The Commander-in-Chief is General MacArthur, and the subordinate generals are Army Commander General Blamey, Air Force Commander Major General Brett, and Navy Commander Rear Admiral Leary. The commander of the U.S. forces in the Philippines is General Wainwright, and the commander of the U.S. forces in Australia is Major General Barnes. Regarding this matter, Australian Prime Minister Curtin wrote to General MacArthur, stating that he had received a telegram from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of his country that his headquarters had been approved by the President of your country. He had notified the advisors of his government to submit a report on the transfer of his country's troops to his control as soon as possible so that they could be handed over as soon as possible. The date will be decided after consultation with him. As for the relationship between New Zealand and the Supreme Headquarters of the Southwest Pacific, it is now a mystery. The statement issued by the U.S. Army Headquarters in Australia yesterday did not mention New Zealand, while Australian Prime Minister Curtin's letter to MacArthur specifically stated that New Zealand is affiliated with the Supreme Headquarters of the Southwest Pacific. What the truth is, Prime Minister Curtin and General MacArthur are unwilling to explain.

Lisbon, 19th (Allied Press) - According to a dispatch from Washington, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson issued a statement saying, "We have given MacArthur the supreme command authority in the Southwest Pacific for Allied operations and actual strategy. MacArthur's authority is determined with the consent of the Australian and Dutch East Indies forces.

Melbourne, 20th (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Curtin met with MacArthur for three hours this afternoon. MacArthur's Chief of Staff Sutherland was also present. Afterwards, Curtin said that the issues discussed at the meeting were extremely confidential and could not be made public in detail. The talks were satisfactory. Regarding strategy, the government and MacArthur's headquarters have the same concepts.

Japanese Forces Continue to Bombard Corregidor Fortress

Washington, 20th (Reuters) - According to the Department of the Army, the Corregidor Island fortress at the mouth of Manila Bay is still being heavily bombarded by Japanese planes and artillery. On the islands of Cebu and Panay, U.S. forces are still resisting the Japanese offensive. Guerrilla forces of the U.S. and Philippine allied forces in northern Luzon attacked a Japanese outpost in the mountains of southern Nueva Vizcaya province. As for the "casualties" in Corregidor Island, it is worth mentioning that an American flag, which has always been flying on a 10-zhang-high flagpole at the highest point of the fortress, was hit by shrapnel from Japanese shells on the Bataan Peninsula, and the flag's hoist rope was broken. The flag slowly fell, and an officer noticed it and rushed to rescue it. At the same time, two soldiers repaired the flagpole rope amid a rain of bullets and completed the task. A few minutes later, the American flag was still flying on the top of the island. Commander General Wainwright learned of this and immediately ordered a commendation.

Panay Island, 19th (Allied Press) - On the morning of the 18th, Japanese troops rescued 426 Japanese residents (including 43 women and 116 children) from a small school 4 kilometers southeast of Passi.

According to Mr. Takaizumi Izō, chairman of the Japanese Residents Association in Iloilo, "We were arrested on December 8th. Women and children were detained in the city hall and Japanese elementary school, and all men were sent to prison to be guarded. On December 27th, all the Japanese residents were transferred to the San Agustin University and gathered together. The Spanish priest there was very friendly and treated us very well. After January 21st, we were transferred here. At 10 AM on the 16th, we heard that Japanese troops had landed, and 29 of the 32 American military police guarding us had fled. By the morning of the 17th, the remaining three had also fled. Therefore, we immediately organized a self-defense force and waited quietly for rescue."

Special Issue on the Indian Question

### After Four British Reigns

Let us assume a certain Mr. A is talking with a British person, discussing the issue of India;

Mr. A: Why does Britain manage India?

British person: The British purpose is solely to develop commerce in India.

Mr. A: Just trade, why interfere with other people's national politics? And not only interfere with national politics, but simply treat India as a colony and reign over it?

British person: This is just a means of securing commerce; otherwise, if Spain, Russia, and France had more solid foundations in India than Britain, how could Britain have gained a foothold?

Mr. A: Since the British defeated the French in 1761, the British have already dominated the Indian market. Why further intensify the rule of India and station a large army for defense?

British person: This is because the Indians do not have deep faith in the British, and the situation is extremely unstable. To protect British expatriates and British investment, it is necessary.

Mr. A: By 1858, the Indians had already submitted. Why not take advantage of the situation and let the Indians govern themselves?

British person: That is probably because India lacks leadership talent.

Mr. A: What about Mahatma Gandhi? Why did the British break their promise in 1919?

British person: That was because after the European war, there was a great epidemic in India. No less than twelve million people died in British India. How could the British abandon them?

Mr. A: Recently, the Indians have been demanding independence with all their might. Why are the British still reluctant to let go?

British person: The Hindu and Muslim sects are like fire and water. If the British were to let go, the two sects would inevitably quarrel. In the event of a civil war in India, the outcome can be predicted without the need for the discerning; the global situation will also undergo major changes as a result.

From the above dialogue, it can be seen that the British manage India with good intentions; it can also be understood what kind of policy Britain is adopting regarding the current Indian issue. As for how this issue will be resolved in the future, we need to analyze the various measures taken by Britain since ruling India to understand.

Britain began managing India as early as the year 1600 AD. Until 1858, it can be called the era of the East India Company. From 1858 to the present, it can be called the era of Governor-General rule. However, a hundred years before the Governor-General's rule, namely in 1758, the first commissioner appointed by Britain was discovered in Bengal. It was not until 1885 that an organization called "Parliament" was created, and in 1931, the slogan of a "Federal Government" was suddenly advocated.

The goal of this parliamentary organization was to improve society, but it had no real political power, and its dissolution or convocation only required a word from the Governor-General. It was not until the European War in 1914 that Gandhi used it as a force once. As for the Federal Government, although Britain has repeatedly urged it, it has not yet been realized. Why does Britain want to promote the Federal Government? Because British India only occupies eleven provinces of the entire country, which is three-fifths of the territory, while the remaining two-fifths are managed by five hundred and sixty-two native kings. The British have always implemented a policy of appeasement towards these kings, but there is no suitable way to take them all down at once. Coincidentally, at the Round Table Conference that year, some of these kings advocated a federation, so the British wanted to use this organization to bring all the kings under their control. Ten years later, partly due to the kings' differing opinions, and partly due to the British's deliberate and overly cautious approach, the federation has not yet been realized.

However, how has Britain ruled India for these three hundred years? During the East India Company era, economic control was the first tool, with military force as its backing. After the commissioner began, political methods were mixed in on top of economic and military forces. During the Governor-General era, in addition to exerting political, economic, and military authority, various functions such as education, social undertakings, transportation, agriculture, and industry were constantly added. The British's intentions were extremely clever, and everywhere they took the lead in calling for benefits for the Indians, and they also came up with various methods to guide and encourage the Indians to be loyal to the British. Apart from the three major areas of national defense, diplomacy, and church management, the Indians were allowed to benefit somewhat. For example, half of the 1,107 people in the highest "Civil Service" were Indians. They all enjoyed the same treatment as the British. This kind of high position and generous salary bought a lot of loyalists. The influence of these loyalists was directly spread to the people.

If one were to ask what benefits the British have created for the Indians since ruling India, they could also list some achievements. Afforestation, irrigation, improved cotton seeds, tea mining, road construction, railway construction, shipping, commerce, schools, marriage reform, abolition of widowhood customs, industrial creation, military training, public health, continuous efforts to break down the class system, and so on.

Regarding these, the general Indian "nationalist" perspective is different. They say that for all the profitable undertakings, the British are only absorbing generous interest on their investments. Thirty-eight percent of British goods are sold to India, and thirty-two percent of Indian products are exported to Britain, and only Britain profits. Between 1930, 250 million pounds of gold flowed from India to Britain. In addition, there is always an imbalance between Indian currency and British currency, and the exchange rate is always disadvantageous to Indian currency. As for schools, they are only training centers for scribes and clerical staff. As for military training, no Indian has ever been seen as a military officer above the rank of major. Although a lot of money is spent on public health, epidemics are still rampant every year.

No wonder Mahatma Gandhi sarcastically said; For a hundred years, the British have done a lot for the Indians, but they have also committed a great evil, because the British have never tried to let the Indians be responsible for organizing their own government. To say that the Indians cannot govern themselves is to blame the British for never giving the Indians a chance to experiment.

But the British also have a saying: They say that, in any case, India is somewhat modernized. If it were not for the various facilities of the British, India may still be living in the pre-fifteenth century. To step back and say, even if Britain did not come to India, there would have been France, Russia or other countries.

However, a country's demand for independence and autonomy is a natural tendency. Whether it is a policy of appeasement or military conquest, from a historical point of view, every boil and blister eventually comes to a head. According to physics, the heavier the pressure, the higher the rebound.

Now is the critical moment. While the Indians feel confused and dangerous, shouldn't the British also think about the bigger picture?

### International Red Cross Agency to Handle Overseas Mail for Civilians - Cooperation with the Japanese Side Has Been Agreed Upon, Limited to 25 Words Per Letter, and Will Be Responsible for Enquiries on the Situation of Individuals in the Occupied Areas

Mr. Ygier, representative of the International Red Cross in Shanghai, sent a circular to the press yesterday morning, stating that the International Red Cross is cooperating with the Japanese authorities, and the organization's headquarters in Geneva will be responsible for forwarding letters from civilians in the Far East to civilians in Europe, America, Africa, and Australia.

Restrictions on the Nature of Letters to be Forwarded

Such letters must be purely personal and family matters, limited to 25 words, and must be written on special stationery, and the delivery of such letters will depend on the appropriate postal lines that can be obtained. Ygier also elaborated on the work of the International Red Cross in Shanghai and the Far East, saying that although the Japanese government has not ratified the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war, as formulated by the International Red Cross on July 27, 1929, it has notified the Geneva International Red Cross Committee that the Japanese government will abide by the spirit of the convention.

Status of Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong Can Also Be Enquired

The International Red Cross Committee is also responsible for inquiring about the situation of civilians in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Syonan Island, the Dutch East Indies, and other areas occupied by the Japanese army. Due to the lack of postal and telegraphic convenience for the time being, it can only inquire about civilians with fixed addresses in Hong Kong. However, it is hoped that with the cooperation of the Japanese authorities, this service can be extended to other areas occupied by the Japanese army in the short term.

Investigating the Fate of Individual Soldiers

In addition, the International Red Cross Committee will try to obtain information about the fate of some British, American, and Dutch soldiers to the greatest extent possible, that is, to find out whether they have been captured, injured, or killed in action. This information is collected by the Tokyo Prisoner of War Information Bureau entrusted by the Japanese authorities, and the list of casualties and prisoners will be notified to Ygier, the representative of the International Red Cross in Shanghai, at any time. At present, it is still impossible to obtain this information, and it will take a long time to receive the list of casualties and prisoners. It is estimated that the Japanese army has captured more than 300,000 prisoners so far, and it will take a long time to record their names. The representatives of the International Red Cross Committee will also serve as liaison officers between the Geneva International Red Cross Headquarters and the Red Cross Societies of Japan, the United States, and other countries, in accordance with the International Red Cross Convention signed on July 27, 1929, which stipulates the registration of prisoners of war, the distribution of comfort goods, and the forwarding of prisoner mail, as well as reporting on the health status of prisoners, sanitary facilities, and the burial of dead prisoners.

### Time for Selling Foreign Rice Continued to Be Extended

Yesterday, half of the rice shops in the two concessions sold foreign rice from the county. The time for selling the rice was from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., which was continuously extended to facilitate the public's purchase of rice. The amount of rice sold was still limited to one liter per person, and the price was 2.9 yuan in national currency. The police continued to line up and number people when buying rice, and strictly implemented finger dyeing. The crowded situation has not been reduced at all. The supply has become more widespread due to the extension of time.

### Citizens Leaving Shanghai Applying for Certificates More and More Enthusiastically

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the office and sub-offices of the Public Works Department that issue return-to-hometown certificates are still issuing return-to-hometown certificates as usual on Saturday afternoons and Sundays and do not take holidays. Therefore, the day before yesterday, Sunday, they also accepted applications for certificates from citizens leaving Shanghai as usual. The total number issued throughout the day was more than 2,000. Yesterday, the issuance was even more enthusiastic, and the number issued throughout the day should be between 3,000.

Yongyao Shuttle Bus Adds Shifts - Due to the restoration of the Shanghai-Ningbo line transportation of passengers, more and more people are leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns. It is found that among the returning population in recent days, although there are people of all nationalities, the Ningbo and Shaoxing regions see the largest number. As for those who arrive in Ningbo and then go to Cixi and Yuyao counties, the schedule of the Yuyao shuttle bus used to be once a day in both Yongyao at 8:00 a.m. Now that there are more and more returnees, it has been changed to two shifts a day, one at 7:00 a.m. and one at 9:00 a.m.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation Resumes Passenger Service - The Wanjixun Continues to Sail

The Changshan wheel of the East Asia Shipping Company and the Haitong wheel of the Zhejiang East Navigation Company set sail from the Baitaigu Yangzi wharves the day before yesterday afternoon and have now arrived safely in the honey wave and are loading passengers and cargo in preparation for the return voyage. The Hualin wheel returned to the port from Ningbo the other day and berthed at the Yangzi wharf. It then set off at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. It is reported that it was carrying more than 300 passengers and daily necessities. The Wanjixun has been docked at the Huangpu River pontoon after repairs and has not yet sailed. Its schedule is temporarily replaced by the Hualin wheel. It is now scheduled to resume sailing from this shift, and the date was originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon. However, due to the temporary loading of cargo and passengers, the work could not be completed in time and was changed to export this afternoon.

### Rongwu Society Lectures - Confucianism and Buddhism Share the Same Origin

The 43rd session of the Rongwu Lecture Society and the 4th session of the Buddhist Lecture, Layman Jiang Yiyuan lectured on "Promoting Universal Aspiration, Accumulating Good Deeds, Eliminating Disasters, Creating Fortune, and Seeking Buddha's Help to Accomplish the Verse", briefly stating that the world is in chaos due to the chaos of the heart, and the chaos of the heart is due to the chaos of learning. Therefore, in ancient times, when establishing a country, education was the first priority. The great end of teaching is worldly and otherworldly methods. The worldly method is in Confucianism, and the otherworldly method is in Buddhism. They are two but one. Master Lingfeng said, "Combining Laozi and Confucius is Confucianism, and combining Confucianism and Buddhism is one sect." The moral studies of Confucianism are the lifeblood and marrow of Buddhism. There is true Confucianism, then there is true Buddhism, that is, saying the verse: "Widely practice the virtues of Buddhism and Confucianism, achieve exemplary models, filial piety, compassion, diligence, and frugality, and the people will uniformly follow. Master Lingfeng's comprehensive theory is actually a great achievement of Confucianism and Buddhism. Buddhism must always follow the same path to open up universal peace." Subsequently, Mr. Jin Dingdong elaborated on the education of Confucianism and Buddhism, and exerted it to the fullest. After the lecture, he announced the next session of the National Studies Lecture on the 26th and dispersed.

### Refusal to Pay Rent and Use of Force - The Tenant is Fined

The tenant who was fined is Qian Bingshan, a cotton cloth merchant from Wuxi, who is 31 years old. He lives in room 4 of the Beijing Apartment on Bubai Road. At about 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, Zhang Zhiren, the tea house worker of the apartment, was ordered by the owner to collect the rent from Qian, which angered Qian. He colluded with his wife, Fang (26 years old from Dinghai), to beat Zhang and bit off a section of the little finger of his left hand. Zhang fainted to the ground in pain. His colleagues called the police and arrested Qian and his wife and escorted them for investigation and ordered them to pay Zhang 750 yuan for medical expenses.

### The Land of Female Power in the East - Sketches of Burmese Women (Continued)

The matchmaking is arranged by the unmarried girl: a village girl puts a lamp in the window to show the other party "at home". She puts on beautiful clothes, wears flowers on her head, and her face and neck are powdered, silently and affectionately, preparing to conquer her opponent: if it is a moonlit night, this happy scene is even more vivid and fragrant, the suitor comes in the moonlight, doing all the tricks a lover should do, with people hidden nearby, ready to be called out, because she knows that many men are unreliable, and parents also use their old eyes to peek at the progress of the love from a clever crevice, to prevent excessive enthusiasm or accidents:

When two people are in love, they exchange small gifts, embroidered handkerchiefs, flower scarves, and love poems and songs.

Simple Wedding - Feeding Each Other Seven Mouthfuls

The progress of love leads to the stage of marriage. Although her six marriage matters have been agreed to by her parents, the decision-making power is still controlled by herself, and her parents mostly take a non-interference policy, only acting as advisors and mentors. She wants to marry a man whom she believes she can share a lifetime of happiness with. If she finds that her marriage is a mistake, she can put the failure aside forever and marry another man, so as to achieve the true meaning of marital happiness; she does not have to marry anyone, as long as there is love, unlike the old-style marriage in our country, where daughters are married off and handed over to strangers like selling goods. Here, it must go through courtship and struggle.

The age of marriage is relatively young now, about eighteen or nineteen for men and thirteen or fourteen for women. Women who have received higher education are about eighteen or nineteen, the same age as or slightly older than their partners, because they have freedom of love, and they are mostly of comparable age, so that they can get love and combine.

The wedding, in Burmese, is called "Li Dabe" (Lot Htut Pwe), meaning "joining hands." The procedures are very simple, without religious rituals or colors. Buddhism believes that the union of men and women belongs to secular matters. The usual wedding is a coconut, a fold of betel nut, and a handful of tea leaves. Famous elders are invited to formally feed the bride and groom, seven mouthfuls each. Then, the hands of the bride and groom are placed in a silver pot filled with water, and finally, congratulations are given to the newlyweds. After the ceremony, the groom's parents lead the groom to the bride's parents and ask them to treat him like their own son. The bride's parents return the gift in the same way. The parents of the newlyweds must give gifts to the newlyweds, which can be movable or immovable property, and they should announce in front of the guests that when the newlyweds go home, there is no marking, no engagement ring, and no use of the man's surname or titles such as "Mrs." or "Grandma" to indicate that she is married. She also does not swear obedience to her husband before God, and she is not bound by our three obediences and four virtues.

When she becomes a widow, she can remarry immediately, and society will not attack her: when she is suing for divorce, she does not have to worry or be anxious about the court's decision. To put it bluntly, it is simply not a problem for Burmese widows to remarry, and there is no reason to refuse a request for divorce.

Social Organization Emphasizes Women's Rights

Burmese society attaches great importance to women, and the law gives them special protection. The nickname "Land of Female Power in Asia" is indeed worthy of the name. In the past, Burma had a large land area and a small population. In order to increase the population, the king allowed foreigners to live in Burma and marry Burmese women. If they left Burma, their wives, sons, and daughters had to be left behind, otherwise, a heavy tax would be imposed. With the government's permission, only boys were allowed to leave the country, because girls were to be kept in Burma to bear children. After the husband left Burma, the wife could remarry, otherwise, the woman would have to pay a monthly tax of 20 tap (ancient Burmese currency). Also, if a woman owed a debt of more than 25 shields and was unable to repay it, she would be made a slave, but if the debtor gave birth to a son, the previous debt would be cancelled. Secondly, the "marital property system" can be called a unique feature of the "Land of Female Power".

Property is divided into three types: pre-marital property, post-marital joint property, and inherited or gifted property. Pre-marital property becomes joint property after marriage, but it can only be merged if both parties agree to reciprocity before or after marriage. In the event of an unfortunate divorce, the pre-marital property will be withdrawn separately, and the post-marital property will be analyzed by mutual agreement, or judged by the village chief or elder who allows the divorce.

The most painful thing for women after marriage is childbirth, especially for Burmese women. After the baby is born, yellow covers are used to wipe the whole body of the woman in labor, fierce fire is lit in the room, and the unchanging recipes of the past dynasties are roasted and wrapped in waste cotton and placed on the navel of the woman in labor. Then, a dried plant is roasted to release its odor and eliminate the toxic gases in her stomach. After continuing for a week, boiling soup made from several kinds of herbs is placed in a basin, a wooden chair is placed on the basin, and the woman in labor is taught to sit on it, covered with felt all over her body until she is sweating profusely, and then rinsed with cold water before the woman in labor is freed.

Learning the Dao, Building Pagodas and Repairing Bridges in Old Age

They grow up in the southern country, develop early, and age quickly. In old age, their silver hair is twisted casually, and they no longer pay attention to it as they used to. Their minds only yearn for comfort in the soul. If they have any savings, they begin to work hard on charitable causes, such as pagodas, bridges, wells, etc., which are all their goals. In their old age, religious belief is particularly important, and rosary beads are always held in their dry-wood-like fingers. They constantly recite the Buddha and chant sutras all day long when they have time. Although they are physically unable to support themselves, they are still willing to worship the Buddha and offer flowers. They constantly walk to nearby monasteries, especially the temples they built themselves. There, they sit respectfully at the feet of the abbot and listen attentively to the monk's words of exhortation.

### Manager Sells Soap, Shareholders Allege Embezzlement

Luo Zilin from Shaoxing, in June of last year, gathered shares to open the Da Zhonghua Refinement Factory at 222 Miller Road. Luo himself invested 7,500 yuan and was elected manager by the shareholders. However, the factory neither started operations nor was dissolved. Nearly a year later, Luo's salary and food expenses have not been paid. Luo then sold soap and other goods worth over 10,000 yuan, and the proceeds were recorded under his personal temporary account. Zhang Yuqing, the representative of Jiu Feng Xinji Silk Fabric Store, one of the shareholders, believed that this action had not been approved by the shareholders and accused Luo of embezzling public funds. He reported this to the Lao Zha Police Station. After investigation, Chinese detective Liu Yukun arrested Luo and, after investigation, ordered him to post 3,000 yuan bail pending investigation and verification. The plaintiff, however, claimed that the soap was worth about 50,000 yuan at current market prices and requested an increase in Luo's bail amount, but this was not approved by the authorities.

### Two Roads

— Liu Jiagan

I don't know where I saw a religious propaganda painting. It clearly depicted two roads, with a signpost erected at the intersection of the two roads. From the sign, you could see that the names of the two roads were "Eternal Life" and "Eternal Death." The "Eternal Death" road was lined with flames, and I remember that those flames represented things like "brothels," "gambling," "dance halls," and "opium." Perhaps the "Eternal Death" road was easier to walk or more "beautiful" than the "Eternal Life" road, so there were especially many people walking on the "Eternal Death" road. From the painting, the crowded situation was not unlike the current queues to buy cheap rice. But on the "Eternal Life" road, it was completely different. Even if there wasn't a single spark on the roadside, even if the magnificent "Holy City" stood at the end of the "Eternal Life" road, there were only a few people walking on that road!

I am not a religious person, so I don't want to "preach" here. But the implication of this propaganda painting is very profound. Isn't everything depicted on it the "cross-section of society" of ordinary people?

Every moment, large groups of people arrive at the intersection of these two roads. Unfortunately, large groups of people walk unhesitatingly onto the "Eternal Death" road. They are reveling and intoxicated on the "Eternal Death" road, until the flames come and engulf them!

Two roads are placed before you:

One is "Eternal Death," with the "trap of destruction" hidden at its end; the other is "Eternal Life." Although this road is not smooth, it is ____________, and at the same time, you can see the light of success beckoning you ahead.

——Which road are you willing to choose?

### Pay Attention to Hygiene

— Wang Ye

Even though I know shouting about health techniques is a ridiculous thing, I still think it's good to shout about.

The way to maintain health involves both nourishment and fitness. Now that we have corn, we can rest easy about nutrition; but for health, we only need to pay attention to hygiene.

Hygiene has many aspects: expensive clothes need to be disinfected, food needs to be disinfected, everything needs to be disinfected, and even walking and talking should be done in a disinfected manner; plus, supplements should be added. The middle-of-the-road approach is simply to sleep early, rise early, and exercise diligently. The lower class, besides taking a full-body bath at the bathhouse, probably still sends anything and everything into their mouths.

Actually, there’s no need to make a fuss about hygiene; stomach problems are more serious. But you must never get sick, because many medicines are currently out of stock.

So, we need to take care of our stomachs and talk about hygiene; we can't afford rice, and we can't buy medicine. It's really hard to be a person!

Although it's not that difficult: illness enters through the mouth, so not eating naturally solves all the problems in the world. But that can’t be done…

In the end, everyone can only "pay attention to hygiene" themselves.

### Smile

— Ye Luo

I sat in the photography studio, and the photographer kept telling me as he took my picture: -- Look! -- Don't move, look at the camera. -- Sir, you're too stiff, you need to smile a little. -- You look like you're arguing with someone, it'll look ugly in the picture. -- You need to smile a little. -- Still stiff, sir, please force a smile. -- Smile! -- Smile! -- That's right, but you still need to smile a little. -- You can smile a little more. -- Smile a little more. -- That's good, very good: don't move.

The shutter of the camera clicked, and my "beautiful image" flew into the camera.

The photo emerged from the developing and retouching process: a smiling face, somewhat similar to the "everyone is happy" Amitabha Buddha; it was actually sent to the photo studio's display case for exhibition. -- What a joyful and happy smile!

### Shared Fate in Stormy Weather

— He Jia Zhi

(III) A Guest Arrives

When Fei Changhe saw the banknotes, he didn't hear what Wei Cheng was saying; he just pushed the banknotes back and said, "Taking the money on the spot, how can I do that? I was just talking." He Zixing and A Xing both said, "If they give you money, just take it. Why be polite?" Fei Changhe took the money and changed his tone again: "This is just Fei Changhe borrowing from Young Master Ye. I will definitely return it tomorrow. Cui Zhen, you go with Young Master Ye. You are related to them. Living at the Ye family is like living at your mother's house. Good, I have some things to go out to do." Fei Changhe walked even faster than Wei Cheng, and in the blink of an eye, he had dashed out the door. His wife said, "Young Master Ye, if you give him money, he will gamble again. How can we live like this? If he has money, he will gamble; if he doesn't have money, he will still gamble." Wei Cheng said, "If you can't live like this, then Sister Cui Zhen can't live like this even more." Wei Cheng asked Cui Zhen to pack a bag with some underwear. Cui Zhen couldn't say she was overjoyed, and packed a bag and left with Wei Cheng.

When Madam Ye the Second saw Wei Cheng bringing Cui Zhen back, she asked what had happened and said, "Wei Cheng, you handled this very well. So things in the world often turn misfortune into blessing. At first, everyone was worried about Miss Cui Zhen; now, everyone is happy for Miss Cui Zhen." Cui Zhen thanked everyone in the house, and expressed her gratitude to Yun He Zixing and A Xing. Then she said, "My uncle's temper is unpredictable. Tonight, when he sees the money, he will naturally have nothing to say. But tomorrow, he might change his mind. The reason I didn't want to disturb Second Aunt and Brother Cheng was because of this reason: My uncle desperately wants money, and Second Aunt always loves me and is willing to spend money for me. If I think about it carefully tomorrow, this money is spent by me, not taken by my uncle. Why should I have Second Aunt and Brother Cheng spend money?" Madam Ye the Second was afraid that Cui Zhen would become overwhelmed with sorrow, so she took her hand and said, "Let's go rest. We can discuss things slowly tomorrow. Wei Cheng, do you have anything else to say to Sister Cui Zhen?" Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cui Zhen should remember that living in my house is the same as living in her own house." (55)
