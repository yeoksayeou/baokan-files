Hankou, 24th (Domei News Agency) - At dawn yesterday, Japanese forces launched a strong offensive against the Chongqing 41st Army's 121st and 124th Divisions, which were attempting to attack the Japanese defense line in Anlu District, Hubei Province. At noon, they captured the forward positions of Zhangshoudian and Gaotianpu (both transliterations, located 15 kilometers north and northwest of Anlu). They are currently pursuing the enemy in the sweltering heat. Simultaneously, Japanese forces in central Hubei Province attacked defending troops at dawn on Tuesday, resulting in 235 enemy deaths. These troops were transferred from the 27th and 25th Divisions and guerrilla units and approached Huijia Town (transliteration), 8 kilometers northeast of Jingshan. The Japanese forces immediately attacked them.

### Fierce Battles on the Ruweisat Ridge: German Artillery Bombards Advancing British Forces; Scale of Fighting in Other Areas Reduced

Lisbon, 24th (Domei News Agency) - The new battle of El Alamein in Egypt has entered its third day. The most intense fighting in this battle is taking place on the Ruweisat Ridge in the central sector of the Egyptian front, which stretches for ten miles. German forces are rushing large numbers of artillery units to this area to bombard British forces advancing on this position. Conflicting reports indicate that the artillery bombardment from both sides is intensifying and that a major tank battle will soon reach its climax. The scale of fighting in other areas of the front has decreased, reaching a stage of consolidating positions. The central sector is filled with the roar of artillery fire today. German General Rommel has begun to redeploy his mechanized units and truck-borne infantry to counter British forces moving along the edge of the Qattara Depression. Several skirmishes have already occurred between the two sides. Activity is frequent in the desert between the Ruweisat Ridge and the Qattara Depression. On Wednesday night, German and British artillery engaged in a fierce exchange throughout the night. Small units of British infantry and machine gun teams attempted to cross open ground and penetrate German positions. German anti-tank guns opened fire, followed by fierce fighting between tanks and artillery. The attacking British forces were repulsed by the anti-tank guns. Initial reports merely stated, "The battle situation is still unclear." Simultaneously, the fighting in the northern sector has shifted from El Eisa, but the situation remains unchanged.

Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Domei News Agency) - British forces on the Egyptian front resumed their offensive on Wednesday night, but on a small scale. German forces are holding their defensive lines, waiting for the enemy to tire. Fighting continued yesterday without major changes. Yesterday morning was limited to artillery duels and sporadic tank and infantry engagements.

Rome, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's Italian military report stated that Italian forces have occupied the Siwa Oasis, southeast of Jaghbub within Egyptian territory.

Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Havas News Agency) - According to a London dispatch in the Swiss newspaper "Journal de Genève," although British newspapers are using large headlines to report on the new offensive in Egypt by General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Forces, British officials are remaining silent about the nature of this offensive and its future objectives. The general impression is that the British are attempting to use this offensive to regain the advantage lost by the recent ineffective German offensive. It is generally believed that General Auchinleck is expanding a local offensive. However, the resistance of the Axis forces demonstrates that they are not entirely unprepared and are capable of launching a major offensive towards Alexandria. Therefore, the British objective is to preemptively destroy German preparations.

Rome, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Reports indicate that the commander of the New Zealand forces on the Egyptian front, General Freyberg, has been seriously wounded and has been rushed to the Cairo Military Hospital for treatment.

Egypt Takes Measures to Protect Its National Interests

Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to Cairo reports received from German sources, the Egyptian General Staff has taken decisive steps to protect its national interests. Recently, many British troops stationed in Egypt have been transferred to the El Alamein front for reinforcement. The defense duties they left behind have been immediately taken over by Egyptian troops. For example, railway and highway hubs, as well as bridges and embankments, have all been taken over by Egyptian forces. Even a large part of the Suez Canal area is now guarded by Egyptian troops. Egyptian soldiers have received orders to fire on anyone approaching restricted areas, without stating any exceptions for British troops. According to German sources, this is to prevent the British from implementing a "scorched-earth policy." It is also reported that the King Farouk's Guard has been reorganized recently, significantly increasing its strength. The palace is entirely guarded by Egyptian troops, with no British troops in the vicinity. According to Cairo reports today, the former Secretary-General of the Nationalist Party, Makram Ebeid, recently disagreed with Prime Minister Nahhas and, along with 26 members of his party, was expelled from the party. They have now formed an opposition party.

Istanbul, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Rumors here suggest that if German forces break through the British defense line at El Alamein on the Egyptian front, the Egyptian government will move from Cairo to another location.

Eden avoided mentioning the second front issue, only stating that the war had reached its peak. He believed that the outcome of the war would be determined on the Eastern Front and in North Africa. Although British forces have suffered repeated defeats, Britain's determination to achieve final victory has not been affected. In terms of social policy, the British government will correct past mistakes, as only a healthy population can build a better world. He hoped that Britain and the United States would continue to cooperate in peacetime.

### Hull Broadcasts to the American People Yesterday

Lisbon, 24th (Domei News Agency) - According to reports from Washington, Secretary of State Hull broadcast to the nation on the evening of the 23rd, frankly explaining that the current US military operations are due to the United States and other democratic nations neglecting military preparedness for their own interests. He urged Americans to rise up in time and face the difficulties together. The main points of his speech are summarized as follows: (1) It is common throughout history that those who fight for freedom often neglect to defend their freedom after obtaining freedom and valuable privileges, and only realize that they are unprepared when they are suddenly attacked by new threats. (2) The United States and the United Nations are forced to fight due to being attacked because they have forgotten many lessons from history. (3) Since the last major war, the United States and many countries have sacrificed collective security guarantee systems for their own interests, neglecting to provide equal opportunities to all countries, leading to political suspicion and competition in arms expansion, and causing panic in the world after the economic countries fall into poverty. Emerging forces then take advantage of the situation, and the entire world is enveloped in the smell of gunpowder. (4) The United States, starting with the attack on Pearl Harbor last December, has been attacked by the three Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy. The Axis powers believe that they must suppress the United States in order to achieve victory. (5) We must know that merely repelling attacks on the US border is not the same as winning this war. In this war, the tasks of every citizen are extremely important. You must not be discouraged by temporary defeats. It is essential to know that achieving final victory depends on every citizen of the United Nations sacrificing everything to obtain it.

The Northwest Frontier Police Minister, detecting this situation, requested the Indian government to urgently send more police officers. Seven thousand police officers have already been dispatched from New Delhi to that area. The Indian government also plans to transport 13,500 guns to the Northwest Frontier, of which 10,000 will be distributed to pro-British local natives.

### British and Soviet Aircraft Attack German Territory Separately; German Aircraft Bomb British Industrial Area

### German High Command Announces Occupation of Rostov; Volga-Caucasus Battle Begins; Moscow's Situation Also Becomes Critical

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency Urgent Dispatch) - The German High Command issued a special communiqué stating, "Our forces have occupied Rostov."

Führer Headquarters, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German war report stated that German aircraft assisted German and Slovak troops in breaking through the strong enemy defenses of Rostov and occupying the city. The remaining enemy forces in the city are being cleared. In the Don River area, our infantry and mechanized units destroyed newly arrived Soviet reinforcements, destroying 69 tanks and 29 artillery pieces. Strong enemy forces northwest of Voronezh attacked several times but were repulsed. Our fighter planes and dive bombers aided the army in inflicting heavy casualties on enemy troops. The enemy suffered heavy losses. In the Volga and Leningrad areas, enemy forces attacked repeatedly without success. Enemy forces preparing to launch a major offensive were dispersed by our artillery fire. In the Arctic region, German aircraft attacked submarines and military facilities in the port of Polyarnoe. Yesterday, the Soviets lost 83 aircraft, and 7 of our aircraft went missing.

Moscow, 24th (Domei News Agency) - It has been publicly acknowledged here that Rostov is in imminent danger. The city is the terminus of four important railroads and is located 13 miles from the mouth of the Don River. The Don River is the only obstacle in front of the Caucasus Mountains. The German offensive is advancing in a semicircular pattern.

Berlin, 24th (Domei News Agency) - According to military news last night, after German forces entered the outer defensive line of Rostov by 20 miles, they deployed on three sides while spearhead units repeatedly penetrated the city. The gateway to the Caucasus appears to be in imminent danger. It is reported that a large Soviet force is preparing to withdraw from the city and head south across the Don River. However, Berlin believes that one of the Don River bridges has already been destroyed, cutting off the Red Army's retreat route. When a small number of troops retreated, they were heavily bombed by German aircraft. Berlin also suggested that German forces have crossed the Don River in large numbers near Tsimlyansk and are advancing south and east along both banks of the Don River. Their main target may not be limited to Rostov. Other German units appear to be targeting Stalingrad, which is reported to be only 35 miles from the Volga River. Thus, the Don River bend is almost entirely under German control.

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - German and Slovak troops reached the outskirts of Rostov yesterday. The city is the sixth-largest city in the Soviet Union, with a population of 500,000. Before World War I, it was the most modern city in southern Russia. The city is located on the right bank of the Don River, about 50 kilometers from the mouth of the Don River. It is also an important economic and transportation center for the Soviet Union and has evolved from a commercial center to an industrial city. The railway from the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea to Moscow passes through Rostov, and the oil pipeline from the Caucasus to the Donets River basin also passes through Rostov. The city is the "Gateway to the Caucasus" and is a grain market and shipping center with agricultural machinery factories, automobile factories, tractor factories, shoe factories, aircraft factories, and munitions factories.

### German Forces Determined to Launch All-Out Attack on Stalingrad

[City name unclear, possibly Bear City] 24th (Domei News Agency) - The path for the German forces advancing in southern Soviet Union to attack the Caucasus is almost open. After the German announcement of the capture of Rostov, their three-pronged offensive has crossed the Don River region and is advancing towards Stalingrad, making an all-out effort to seize this key area and cut off the Caucasus from the rest of the Soviet Union. Stalingrad is a large city on the Volga River that manufactures tanks, munitions, and forging plants. The danger it faces has increased due to the German advance. This point can be substantiated by the statement that German forces have broken through the Soviet resistance in the Don River bend. At the same time, Moscow news has not confirmed the German occupation of Rostov, only stating that the fighting near Novocherkassk (20 miles northeast of Rostov) on the north bank of the Don River is extremely fierce. Moscow news also reports that German forces are attacking in the Tsimlyansk area, indicating that Stalingrad is also threatened in the southwest and that Soviet forces must withdraw or be surrounded.

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to Moscow news, the Red Army General Staff announced in today's war report, "Today, the Red Army is fighting hard in the vicinity of Voronezh, Tsimlyansk, Novocherkassk, and Rostov. There have been no major events in other battle areas."

Lisbon, 23rd (Domei News Agency) - Moscow, Soviet Information Bureau, published the war situation late on the 23rd, stating that Soviet forces had retreated to new positions after fierce fighting in Novocherkassk.

Bucharest, Romania, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Romanian Rador News Agency's Berlin correspondent, Moscow's situation is critical, and it may be possible for it to fall before Rostov. The German pincer movement is increasingly approaching Moscow, and all railway lines leading to the Russian capital have become useless. Once Moscow falls, not only will the morale of the Red Army be greatly affected, but the communication lines between the Red Army fighting in the various front areas will also be completely cut off. It is obvious that the German authorities do not want to sit idly by and watch the enemy reinforce. The German side believes that attacking the railway center of Moscow is not to be delayed. The fighting in the central and northern areas of the front, though not as magnificent as in the south, is being carried out with the same method and determination. The Red Army General Staff has deployed its forces along the entire line and is advancing according to a meticulously prepared plan.

### Soviets Deploy New Defense Line from Sea of Azov to Caspian Sea

Soviet border area, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - Today marks the 396th day of the German-Soviet war. The most notable events on the front are the beginning of the battle of the Volga and the battle of the Caucasus. A large German unit in the Stalingrad area is advancing along the Don River, intending to invade the Volga River basin. Another two German units are advancing towards the northern Caucasus. One of them is blocked in front of Rostov, and the other, after crossing the Don River, is advancing south. The aim of the German offensive is to control the railway from Stalingrad through Proletarskaya to the Caucasus, where General Timoshenko seems to have decided to defend Rostov to the death, at any cost. Rostov's role in this war is similar to that of Tobruk in North Africa last year. Most of the city has been destroyed by artillery fire, but the Red Army still holds strong positions and disregards the German invasion of the city's defenses, continuing to hold out for some time. As for the lower reaches of the Don River, there are still two German regiments advancing towards the easternmost point of the river. One of them is advancing east, probably reaching the vicinity of Ostrovyansk, while the other is advancing northeast from Kamensk, seemingly without encountering significant resistance. In addition, General Timoshenko seems to have withdrawn the Red Army in the Donets River basin to avoid encirclement. Timoshenko is also reorganizing troops near the Caucasus, preparing to continue the resistance. His new defense line will run from the Sea of Azov to the Caspian Sea, approximately 300 miles long.

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - German authorities said last night that German forces in the lower Don River are continuing to advance fiercely. The vast plains there are extremely suitable for the operations of German mechanized units, so several retreating units have been annihilated. The entire area of the Don River bend is now in German hands. German forces are now only 60 kilometers from the Volga River. German forces in the Voronezh area are continuing to fight defensively. Soviet forces have launched group attacks, but all have been repulsed and have suffered heavy losses.

Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - The Basler Nachrichten newspaper published a Berlin dispatch today stating that, according to the opinions of German military observers, the Red Army in the Don River basin should immediately cease its determined resistance and surrender its arms. However, it is difficult to say how much strength and weaponry the Red Army still possesses. What is known is that all important Soviet strongholds are now under direct threat from German forces. While the Red Army General Staff knew that the Don River would greatly benefit the Red Army's defense, it did not anticipate that a major battle would occur in the south. The German General Staff took advantage of the opportunity as early as last winter to reorganize its forces and prepare to use new weapons in the southern theater. The reason for the current situation lies in this. As for the Red Army's "scorched-earth policy" in the south, German officials commented, "Germany cannot feign benevolence, so the people in the areas destroyed by artillery fire must find their own means of survival. Soviet civilians are undoubtedly victims of the Red Army's barbaric policies. However, no matter how serious the situation, the German General Staff will always prioritize its own troops and continue the war, so it will have no time to deal with the aftermath of the war zone."

### Rapid Harvest Underway in Southern Soviet Regions

Kuybyshev, 23rd (Domei News Agency) -

The Soviet people have begun a rapid harvest in the Volga River basin and southern regions to avoid being caught off guard by the arrival of German forces. However, it is feared that the harvest in the Volga River basin will be difficult to complete this month. Therefore, not only farmers are busy working in the fields, but also civilians without special jobs and women between the ages of fourteen and fifty have been mobilized to help. Evasion will be severely punished. It is reported that a certain young girl was sentenced to six months of hard labor for this reason.

### Turkish President Inspects Agricultural Areas; Cabinet Strives to Solve Production and Supply Problems

Constantinople, 23rd, Havas News Agency – President İsmet Inönü personally inspected agricultural areas in central Anatolia. He arrived in Konya today and delivered a speech to local farmers, urging them to work hard to increase production and ensure abundant food supplies for the coming winter.

Constantinople, 23rd, Havas News Agency – Upon assuming office, the primary task of the Sazakoğlu cabinet is reportedly to resolve various issues related to production and supply. The new government's economic policy will be based on a more liberal foundation, especially concerning the vital wheat market. The initial plan involves thoroughly reorganizing most state-owned and public-private wheat trading organizations. The government is reportedly determined to follow France's example in restoring farmers' confidence. Local price control committees will be abolished and replaced by the Ministry of Trade, which will be responsible for all supply matters. These measures have generally been warmly welcomed by the public, as the food problem has become increasingly severe recently, and rampant black market trading has caused widespread anxiety.

### Southern Sweden Bombed Last Night

Stockholm, 24th, Huitong News Agency – Last night, two unidentified aircraft bombed and set fire to southern Sweden. Two incendiary bombs fell near Solliden Palace on Öland Island, where the King spends his summers. Local soldiers have been deployed in the vicinity. The bomb explosions caused widespread panic, with some people gathering in front of the police station seeking protection, while others rushed into nearby air raid shelters. The atmosphere was tense, and order was disrupted.

### British Houses of Parliament to Adjourn as Usual This Summer; British Government to Propose New Bill to Extend Term of Parliamentarians by Another Year

London, 23rd, Havas News Agency – Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps, the government's representative in the House of Commons, announced today that both houses of Parliament would adjourn as usual this summer. Labor MP Aneurin Bevan immediately expressed indignation and questioned Cripps, "How can the House of Commons consider adjourning at a time when the entire nation is tense due to the government's unclear military intentions? I believe the House should convene a closed-door meeting to discuss the entire war situation." Another MP then asked Deputy Prime Minister Major Clement Attlee whether the United States was represented at the Allied Chiefs of Staff meetings in Britain. Attlee replied that the United States was represented at every meeting, with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Harold Stark and Commander of the European Theater of Operations General Dwight Eisenhower having attended all important meetings. Former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin then questioned whether the House was wasting the officials' time by discussing "purely domestic affairs." Deputy Prime Minister Attlee immediately replied, "You are quite right."

London, 23rd, Havas News Agency – Home Secretary Herbert Morrison announced in the House of Commons today that the government would introduce a new resolution in both houses of Parliament, proposing to extend the term of the current parliamentarians again, by one year from this November. The Northern Ireland Parliament will also introduce a bill of a similar nature.

### Italy Releases Indian POWs, Reorganizes Them into Colonial Army

Bern, 23rd, Havas News Agency – A correspondent for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in Milan reports that a group of Indian prisoners of war, carefully selected by the Italian military authorities, have been released with the consent of the Italian Foreign Ministry. After swearing allegiance, they have been incorporated into the Italian army and wear Italian colonial army uniforms.

Military Plans Will Never Be Disclosed

Stockholm, 24th, Huitong News Agency – During yesterday's session of the British House of Commons, Labour MP Bevan demanded that the government guarantee the early opening of a Second Front, arguing that the public was eagerly requesting an offensive to aid the Soviet Union, and that British workers were greatly surprised by the lack of effective British aid to the Soviets. Sir Stafford Cripps, representing the government, replied that the government would not disclose military plans. This delicate issue could not be discussed even in a closed-door session of the House of Commons, as the intentions of the military authorities could not be revealed to the 615 members of Parliament. The British government understands the public's wishes, and the public should also understand the unreasonableness of Parliament disclosing military plans.

### Soviet Union Urges Britain to Open a Second Front

Stockholm, 24th, Huitong News Agency – A Swedish correspondent in Britain, Lei, reports that the Soviet Union is constantly increasing pressure on Britain to quickly open a Second Front. Soviet Ambassador Maisky has repeatedly met with Prime Minister Churchill and other members of the War Cabinet to discuss the matter. Soviet pressure is not limited to the activities of the Soviet Ambassador to Britain; the public opinion and mass movements echoing the call for a Second Front, such as the mass meeting in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, may well have been orchestrated by the Soviet Embassy in Britain. From a strategic point of view, launching an offensive in Europe at the present time may not be the best option. It would be best to wait until winter, concentrate all efforts in North Africa, and then launch an offensive in Europe the following year. However, the Soviet Union is currently in a very critical situation, so what Britain and the Soviet Union are currently discussing is whether to launch a Second Front in Western Europe immediately, regardless of the consequences. During yesterday's session of the British House of Commons, Labour MP Bevan demanded a debate on the Second Front issue to dispel public doubts, but Sir Stafford Cripps, representing the government, refused to discuss the matter, arguing that even a closed-door session would be inappropriate, as the matter was of great importance and it would be inappropriate for the 600 members of Parliament to know the details.

Stockholm, 24th, Huitong News Agency – Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky continues to lobby British government officials, urging them to quickly open a Second Front. According to British exchange telecommunications news, Maisky has been extremely busy in recent days, meeting with Churchill, Eden, and British army, navy, and air force leaders. People in London are extremely concerned about the situation in the Soviet Union. Responsible parties point out that the number of Russians now under German control has reached 40 to 50 million. If the German army can advance to the Volga River, the Soviet supply line will face the most serious threat.

Berlin, 24th, Huitong News Agency – Berlin military circles, discussing the Anglo-American attempt to open a Second Front, admit that the German army is waiting for the enemy to attempt an offensive. Whether the enemy wants to attack in a few months, a few weeks, or even a few days, we are ready to deal with them at any time. We have been preparing for a long time.

### Mysterious Egypt (Part 1)

Introduction

When Egypt is mentioned, people generally only recall its past, and rarely know anything about its recent situation. Recently, although everyone's attention has followed in the footsteps of the god of war, what is associated with it is nothing more than the pyramids, the Sphinx, mummies, hieroglyphs, and Napoleon's famous expedition to Egypt, etc.

In fact, these are all relics of the past, and can only serve as topics for conversation after meals. It should be known that Egypt is no longer what it used to be. It has long undergone baptism of scientific development, and is progressing with the times. It has also established schools and banks, and issued currencies and public bonds. The industrial and commercial sectors are very developed, and it has a considerable position in the world. The production of cigarettes, in particular, is well known.

This article will focus on describing the recent situation of Egypt, with the aim of helping readers understand the current war situation.

Tracing the Past

Egypt is the birthplace of Western culture, and can also be said to be the earliest place of cultural origin in the world. Its early civilization is of course due to the Nile River. The climate there is warm, and the Nile River floods regularly, so all living things grow very quickly, and brilliant historical sites have been created as early as 5,000 years ago. — Some people believe that the human race also originated here, but this has not been confirmed.

Around 3500 BC, Egypt already had a king named Menes. He established his capital in Memphis. At that time, they already knew how to use large blocks of bluestone for construction. The Great Pyramid, a legacy that people from all over the world come to commemorate, was built using this kind of large stone weighing more than two tons. There are many pyramids in the Memphis area. The one commonly seen in pictures is the Great Pyramid near the Sphinx, which is 500 feet high, much higher than the Shanghai Park Hotel. Someone has estimated that if it were to be rebuilt today, it would require at least 100,000 workers and ten years to complete, which shows the enormity of the project. Judging from this kind of pyramid, people at that time must have had a deep knowledge of geometry, arithmetic, and architectural principles, otherwise it would not have been possible to build it.

Pyramids were actually the tombs of kings and nobles at that time. They wrapped the corpses with extremely fine hemp skin, and then used spices and medicines to make them imperishable, and then put them in golden coffins. Now, thousands of years later, the corpses are still dry, wrinkled, and incorruptible, which is what the world calls mummies.

The Sphinx is a stone statue of the Egyptian king Khafre. It was originally a natural rock that was carved by artists, so it is extremely large and the largest bovine statue in the world. According to research, the statue has subsided a lot due to its age, otherwise it would be even taller above the ground. Everyone who comes to Egypt comes here to visit; Napoleon, who dominated the world for a while, also went to this statue when he was on an expedition to Egypt, and recited Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther" to amuse himself.

Memphis is located west of Cairo, the current capital of Egypt, separated by the Nile River, so transportation is very convenient. There are also many ancient palace ruins there, which are also worth seeing.

After the Menes dynasty, the kingdom became very prosperous, and its territory gradually expanded, occupying the Nile River basin and the Red Sea coast. Culture was also flourishing at that time. In addition to architecture, they also invented phonetic writing, hieroglyphs, stationery, and calendars. They already knew how to make glass and glazed tiles, and could also spin and weave. The fineness of their fabrics was comparable to modern ironware. In terms of art, there were sculptures and paintings. In terms of religion, there was also the concept that the soul must be judged after death, and there was also a "Book of the Dead" (Livre pour les morts) for use after death.

Until 1580 BC, under the leadership of King Thutmose III, Egypt built a navy, invaded the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas, occupied countless islands, and attacked Asia from the Isthmus of Suez, occupying the western part of Arabia. At that time, the Egyptian capital had been moved to Hi Karnak, upstream of the Nile River. To this day, there is still a temple built during the time of Thutmose, with stone pillars 60 to 70 feet high and dozens of circumferences thick. In front of the temple, there is also a stone statue of himself, whose size is almost the same as the Sphinx.

But prosperity must decline. After 1150 BC, the Egyptian empire was repeatedly invaded and conquered by foreigners. First, the Assyrians and Persians invaded. When Greece rose, Ptolemy, Alexander's old general, went to Egypt to become the ruler. He built the city of Alexandria on the Nile Delta, and also built a tall Alexandria statue in the port, which is similar in shape to the Statue of Peace outside San Francisco, USA.

Ptolemy passed the throne on to his descendants for two or three hundred years. It was not until 50 BC that it was taken away by Augustus of the Roman Empire.

During the Abbasid dynasty of the Turkish Tang Dynasty (also known as Abu Lubot), the descendants of Muhammad, the descendant of AH, because they opposed the authorities, ran to Egypt, drove away the Romans, and became the Fatima Dynasty, and from then on established the capital in Cairo.

The Turks ruled for a short time before being occupied by a type of Muslim army, the Mamelukes. In 1517, it was incorporated into the territory of Turkey again.

### Japanese Consulate General Conducts Detailed Study of Price Control Measures; Shanghai and the Interior Adopt Uniform Steps; Strict Control Over All Prices

The Shanghai Times reports that the two-day economic conference held in Shanghai under the auspices of the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai has concluded. The Japanese authorities here prepared yesterday (23rd) to cooperate closely with the Nanjing authorities to strictly implement the five resolutions passed at the conference in order to stabilize prices. Well-informed sources attach great importance to this two-day conference.

Strict Control Over All Prices

According to them, this conference is the beginning of a decisive movement to curb rising prices, stabilize the cost of living for the public, and ensure an even distribution of supply and demand. The conference also resolved to control not only basic prices, but also the prices charged by restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and other establishments. The last meeting was held at the Astor House Hotel on Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. and lasted for more than three hours. Representatives from the Japanese consulates in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Wuhu also attended the meeting to discuss the economic situation in Shanghai and the interior.

Detailed Study of Specific Measures

After the five resolutions on price control were passed, specific measures for implementing the price control regulations were discussed. To facilitate the implementation of these measures, it was unanimously agreed to maintain the closest cooperation with the Nanjing authorities and other price control agencies. This cooperation can adjust the differences between the prices charged by Japanese and Chinese merchants in Shanghai and the interior. According to reports submitted to the conference by representatives from various cities in the interior, the price limit and distribution plans in the interior have been quite successful, especially in Wuhu, where matches, sugar, and several other basic items are sold according to the distribution plan.

Four Important Measures Proposed

Among the many suggestions made at the conference to improve price control, the four most important are as follows: (1) The Japanese authorities in this city should provide statistics to the Japanese authorities in various cities in the interior so that they can calculate wholesale prices; (2) To distribute goods more smoothly to various cities in the interior to meet local needs; (3) All parties should maintain cooperation in order to control prices in the interior; (4) Take concrete steps to control wholesale prices in the interior, as so far the interior has only controlled retail prices and prices for small-scale transactions.

Current System Readjusted

Based on various suggestions, the conference passed resolutions on the following issues: (1) In order to cope with the current needs, the official price limit methods should be readjusted and improved based on the current price limit table system in Shanghai. Therefore, the previously existing price limit tables for various categories of goods should be replaced by price limit tables for all goods, which should be promulgated in Shanghai and various cities in the interior; (2) To give greater legal status to the price marking system implemented in Shanghai in 1940; (3) Invoices must be issued for the sale of goods, and sellers must keep detailed records of all transactions so that the authorities can review them when necessary.

Full Cooperation Between Shanghai and the Interior

(4) Strictly enforce the regulations on the establishment of new stores to prevent unsuitable people from doing business and to prevent those who have been rejected for business licenses in Shanghai from going to various cities in the interior to open shops. In this regard, in order to prevent loopholes, the Japanese and Chinese authorities in Shanghai and various cities in the interior should maintain full contact; (5) Maintain full contact with the Japanese military special service agencies, and the special service agencies will act as liaison between the Japanese economic authorities in Shanghai and the interior and the Chinese authorities, so that the Japanese authorities can know in detail the various control methods implemented by the various agencies of the National Government. The above resolutions will be implemented in the short term.

### Thirty-One Shops in Violation Continue to Be Fined

The Public Works Department's Intelligence Office announced that in the week ending the 18th of this month, the department's price limit enforcement office sent personnel to investigate 1,138 shops, of which 31 were found to have violated the price limit rules and have been punished separately. A large number of other shops have been ordered to comply with the department's regulations and will not be prosecuted for the time being. In the week from the 11th to the 18th of this month, 124 cases were reported in the French Concession for violating the price management regulations, of which 29 shops were punished for failing to adjust prices in accordance with the authorities' instructions, and the remaining 85 were fined for not marking prices.

### Anonymous Person Donates Large Sum to Public Works Department

The Public Works Department's Intelligence Office announced that the department's chairman recently received a donation of 50,000 Central Reserve Bank notes to subsidize the Public Concession's Baosjia (neighborhood watch) expenses. The donor wishes to remain anonymous. He is a close friend of the chairman and a supporter of the department. His generous donation demonstrates his enthusiasm for public welfare and is worthy of admiration. The department has accepted the donation and sent a letter of thanks.

### Rice Shops Not Allowed to Force Citizens to Buy Flour

The Public Works Department's Intelligence Office announced that the department recently issued Announcement No. 6010, stating that when citizens purchase rice from rice shops with rice purchase certificates, they should be free to choose whether or not to purchase flour. If rice shops refuse to sell rice alone, they should immediately report the matter to the police station nearby for investigation and handling.

### Cholera Epidemic in the City Becomes More Rampant; 270 Cases Discovered

Since the two concessions and the Nanshi, Zhabei, and other Chinese areas have successively reported cases of true cholera, according to the health department authorities, the number of cholera cases has reached as many as 270. The French Municipal Council's Health Department said that the spread of cholera is currently being suppressed. In the first two weeks of July, 157 cases of cholera had been discovered, which led the Tokyo Japan Health Association to recognize Shanghai as a cholera epidemic area. At the same time, the health department authorities said that the total number of cholera cases in the city this year is bound to exceed last year's number of 900. The second cholera vaccination campaign is currently being actively promoted by the health authorities in various districts. However, the health department is not satisfied with the results of the average of 25,000 people vaccinated daily in the two concessions in the past few days. It is reported that between April and May, when the first epidemic prevention campaign began, there were often 65,000 to 75,000 people applying for vaccinations from the health departments of the two concessions every day. True cholera has not disappeared since it occurred in the city. However, the health authorities in the two concessions are actively implementing the second vaccination and are implementing blockade disinfection in the residential areas where infected patients occur at any time, so it is hoped that the disease will not spread and will tend to be eradicated.

### Donations to Education and Orphanage Funds for Ding Shou's Birthday Celebration; More Than 2,000 Yuan Received Yesterday

Since the news of Mr. Ding Fubao's 69th birthday was published in this newspaper, people from all walks of life have sent congratulatory gifts. Yesterday alone, more than 2,000 yuan was received. It is expected that the number will be quite considerable by Mr. Ding's birthday on August 3. Mr. Ding is determined not to celebrate his birthday, and will donate all the birthday gifts to this newspaper's reader scholarship fund and the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage. All those who participate in the public celebration will receive a copy of Mr. Ding's book "How to Create My Healthy Life," which is a commemorative book of Mr. Ding's 50 years of writing and living, with rich and valuable content. The list of gentlemen who sent congratulatory gifts yesterday is recorded as follows: Yaoji, 1,000 yuan; Yan Zhichun, 1,000 yuan; Anonymous person, 200 yuan; Yao Zichu, 100 yuan; She Lei, Tong Ruizhong, Ding Bingnan, Huang Ruixiang, Luo Zhijiang, Deng Songying, Lu Guiye, Ying Yongyu, Pu Jiting, 10 yuan each; Li Shoulu, 6 yuan; Luo Hongtao, Zhu Jian, Tong Renxi, Zhang Weichun, Wang Wen , Zhu Zengfu, 5 yuan each; Zhang Jiemin, 3 yuan. The total amount above is 2,429 yuan.

### Bank of China and Bank of Communications Scheduled to Resume Business in Early September; Operating Purely as Commercial Institutions

This newspaper agency reports from this city that the arrangements for the reopening of the former Chongqing banks, namely the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, by the Sino-Japanese Joint Committee are progressing smoothly. As it stands, these two banks will resume business in early September. Their Shanghai branches have been cleaned up and reorganized, and will cut off relations with Chongqing. It is expected that they will open first, and then the branches in other areas will resume business one after another. At that time, the banks will operate purely as commercial institutions under the leadership of the Central Reserve Bank. Their existing capital will be converted into Central Reserve Bank notes at the official exchange rate of two to one. Therefore, the new capital of the Bank of China will be 20 million Central Reserve Bank notes, half of which will be purchased by the Central Reserve Bank. The capital of the Bank of Communications will be 10 million Central Reserve Bank notes, of which 6 million Central Reserve Bank notes will be purchased by the Central Reserve Bank. It is heard that the candidates for general manager of the two banks have been unofficially decided: Wu Zhenxiu will be the general manager of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin will be the general manager of the Bank of Communications. The deputy general manager will be assigned by the Central Reserve Bank.

Central and Farmers Banks Continue Withdrawals

Since the Shanghai Central, Chinese, and Farmers Banks were designated by the relevant authorities to have a Japanese bank handle the liquidation, deposits of general depositors in these two banks whose accounts were verified to be non-enemy assets have been returned in two installments. The amount of the first withdrawal was 1,000 Central Reserve Bank notes per household, and the amount of the second withdrawal was 50% of the remaining balance after the first withdrawal. The third withdrawal of the Central Farmers Bank began yesterday (24th), and the withdrawal amount was the entire remaining balance after the first and second withdrawals. This reporter visited the two banks and learned that starting from 10 a.m. yesterday (24th), the withdrawals were quite enthusiastic. Because there was not much remaining deposit amount, it is expected that the withdrawal can be completed within the next week.

### Third Phase of Grain Distribution Ends This Afternoon

The sale of the third phase of household rice by rice shops in the two concessions will end at 6 p.m. today, and the third rice purchase certificate will also expire from the 26th. It is reported that the fourth phase of rations will be sold by the rice shops starting from the 27th with the fourth rice purchase certificate. The quantity and price will be announced by the Public Works Department on Saturday. It is also learned that the Public Works Department's Grain Management Committee plans to add about two rice shops west of the Hongqiao Road Van Huangdu Railway for grain distribution. This matter is still being investigated to find suitable locations in the area for establishment.

### Landlord Stops Water Supply to Force Tenants to Move Out

A building at 432 to 4 , and Lane 442 on Beijing Road is owned by the Yuanji Company on North Suzhou Road. Recently, the sub-landlords have been involved in a lawsuit with Yuanji Company due to a lease dispute, which has not been resolved. Unexpectedly, Yuanji Company suddenly stopped supplying tap water to the area a few days ago to force the tenants to move out, which has caused great anxiety to the tenants, including the Daxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Tongchang Silk Shop, Dasheng Silk Shop, Dechang Cotton Cloth Shop, Qingda Silk Shop, Fengyuan Tobacco Shop, Taijin Hardware Shop, Jincheng Wood Shop, Jiangxing Wood Shop, Shishunji Shop, etc. The tenants all use tap water especially for daily drinking, and hygiene and cleanliness also depend on it. If a fire breaks out, it will be even more dangerous. Because the matter is related to public health and social stability, they yesterday submitted a document to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession and other relevant parties, appealing for justice and demanding that the landlord restore the supply of tap water.

### Suzhou Creek to Be Connected for Rickshaws: Merger of Two Rickshaw Associations Planned First

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that, according to a press release today (the 24th) from the Tongmenghui [Chinese Revolutionary Alliance], if a plan currently under consideration by the Public Works Department, the Japanese Naval Landing Party, and the Japanese Consulate General is implemented, rickshaws will be able to cross Suzhou Creek directly, similar to how trams are already operating. However, this plan involves technical issues, so its implementation may be delayed. It is understood that the issue involves merging the Shanghai Rickshaw United Association, north of the concession, into the Shanghai Rickshaw Owners United Association, south of the concession, while granting the Public Works Department the authority to manage all rickshaws in the Public Concession. The establishment of two separate rickshaw associations north and south of Suzhou Creek was implemented after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. This inconvenient system is no longer necessary, and the authorities are currently discussing reform measures.

Smooth Negotiations

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that Matsumoto, the newly appointed Director of the Public Works Department's Traffic Division, told reporters this morning (the 24th) that if negotiations between the Public Works Department and the Japanese Naval Landing Party regarding rickshaw licensing in Hongkou are successful, a considerable sum of money will be returned to the Public Works Department's revenue each year. After five years, the Bureau now intends to have rickshaws in the northern districts of the concession re-apply for Public Works Department licenses. It is estimated that there are currently about two thousand public rickshaws in northern Hongkou, and the license fees will increase the Bureau's revenue. This plan is currently only in the negotiation stage, but progress is quite smooth.

Preliminary Plan

When asked about other plans for Shanghai's traffic, he said that he had only arrived here two months ago and was still unfamiliar with the situation in this city. However, he believes that restoring the normalcy of traffic in Hongkou is a preliminary step in any process. It is noted that Matsumoto was sworn in as Assistant Director of the Traffic Division on July 15th and has now succeeded Mr. Feke as the Director. Feke and 74 other British and American police officers have been dismissed and ceased service on July 31st. Matsumoto was previously a consul at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai and has also worked in police affairs for a long time.

### Hengmao Lane Landlord Restricts Water Use

In Hengmao Lane on Mintini Road in this city, the landlord, due to water bill issues, has been threatening to close the main water pipe since a few days ago. The tenants, unable to withstand the pressure, have jointly appealed to the concession authorities to uphold justice. To clarify the truth, the reporter visited the residents of the lane, who said that most of the residents in the lane are on fixed-term leases, with clear stipulations in the lease agreement that water fees are to be borne by the landlord. In May of this year, the Synthetic Real Estate Company's management office notified each household that the water fee would be increased by five cents per month. This was already unexpected. Some tenants, understanding the landlord's difficulties, and considering the amount not large, paid the full amount. Other tenants, based on the lease agreement, were unwilling to pay. Unexpectedly, one wave had barely subsided when another arose. In early June, a notice was issued to all tenants that the water fee would be changed to 13.7 yuan, which, calculated in old legal tender, would be 27.4 yuan. This amount was considered excessive, and they unanimously refused to pay. The landlord, unable to get his way, closed the main water pipe, opening it only three times a day: from 6:30 AM to 8:00 AM, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, totaling only four and a half hours per day. During this scorching summer, when water usage is high, the coercion is particularly severe, and they had no choice but to appeal to the authorities for a fair resolution. It is said that yesterday, the landlord sent a letter to each household, willing to reduce the 13.7 yuan to 10 yuan. However, the residents still considered the amount too high, and a compromise seems difficult. The general opinion of the residents in the lane is that the tenants and the landlord should each bear a reasonable responsibility. The landlord should not shift all water and electricity costs onto the tenants, and the tenants cannot be completely irresponsible. As long as the amount is reasonable, they are willing to compromise and accept it.

### Mock Terrorist Drill Conducted in the French Concession Yesterday

Later, after the disguised perpetrators and suspects were apprehended, the blockade was lifted.

### Dancer's Jewelry Stolen

Tang Mali, a popular Cantonese dancer at the Paramount Ballroom (father's name: Tang Guiyang, residing at 68 Anle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road), did not return home after dancing on the evening of the 22nd of this month. She stayed in Room 6 at the Ingel Hotel at 1222 Avenue Ivanhoe. The next morning at 10:00 AM, she suddenly discovered that a diamond and emerald brooch of considerable value was missing. Unable to find it, she reported it to the Jing'an Temple police station. Detective Yan Bingheng went to investigate. Tan Juanjuan, also a Cantonese dancer at the Paramount Ballroom and a friend of Tang, was also in the room at the time. The detective suspected Tan, but she denied it. After a search, the original brooch was found in her waistband. She was taken back to the police station. After interrogation yesterday, Tan was sentenced to two months imprisonment, suspended for two years.

### Mr. Ding Fubao's Longevity

The More Vegetarian Food You Eat, the Worse It Is

Mr. Ding is a devoted vegetarian, so he dares to say, "The more vegetarian food you eat, the worse it is." Actually, at one point, he was extremely fond of meat, not even satisfied with two large meat-filled meals a day. But his health deteriorated. In 1918, influenced by Dr. Wu Tingfang's advocacy of vegetarianism, he abandoned Western-style meat feasts and adopted a vegetarian and frugal diet, which he has maintained for nearly thirty years. He was sickly and weak as a child. At the age of three, he nearly died from a fever. At sixteen, he suffered from a severe stomach ailment with intense vomiting, which eventually subsided but left him extremely weak. Observers believed he wouldn't live to middle age. Five members of his family died of tuberculosis: his sister-in-law, his esteemed father Chengxiang Gong, his sister, and his two nieces. He also contracted a lung ailment. At that time, life insurance companies were unwilling to insure him. From then on, he focused on health preservation methods, transforming his weakness into health. Later, believing in Wu Tingfang's theory of gastrointestinal hygiene, he began performing enemas every morning before breakfast in January 1912 to prevent toxin buildup from accumulated feces. Six years ago, he started adding a second enema every evening. This gastrointestinal cleansing prolonged his life and warded off illness. Therefore, he says with great confidence, "I pay attention to both diet and excretion. Regular bowel movements can also be said to be one of the keys to longevity."

The old gentleman's eloquence grew even stronger. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief and vigorously waved his folding fan, continuing to explain the art of immortality as if listing his family treasures.

Early to Bed, Early to Rise, One Husband, One Wife

He was like the monk Seng Zhao preaching, even inanimate rocks would nod in agreement. He advocates going to bed early and waking up early, preferably getting eight hours of sleep. Dinner should not be excessive. When sleeping, the upper half of the body should face the right side, because the stomach's lower opening leans towards the right, making it easier for food to pass from the stomach into the duodenum and then into the small intestine. He believes that it is not advisable to work continuously for several hours without rest. It is best to rest for fifteen minutes after every forty-five minutes of work, which can maintain health and avoid fatigue. He advises young people not to indulge in sexual desires, which harm the spirit, and to adhere to a one-husband-one-wife system throughout life. He also advocates that people learn the practice of meditation, sitting quietly at a fixed time each day, concentrating the mind between the eyebrows, without producing a single thought. This allows the spirit to be focused and not dispersed, increasing work efficiency a hundredfold. At this point, he quoted Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching to explain the mysteries of meditation, and greatly elaborated on Lao Tzu's principle of "dim and obscure, obscure and dim."

Some people may imagine that a person as particular about hygiene as Mr. Ding must live a very pampered life, embracing hedonism. But the reality is not so. He has a worldview that can be emulated. What is a worldview?

"What is a worldview!" he said. "A worldview is about the purpose of life. It is not easy to obtain such a body, so naturally there must be a purpose. Is life for eating, living, and playing? No! Life is for serving society, doing one's best to help others. Those with knowledge use their knowledge to help others, those with wealth use their wealth to help others. True happiness is not enjoyment, but giving."

"………………"

"You must know that all benefits, wealth, glory, power, and influence are not your own. The soul is your own. What you are born with, and what you take with you when you die, is knowledge, merit, and sin. Ordinary people 'die wanting money,' but too much money causes trouble. Don't many family homicides occur because of too much money? It is best to work and eat, and be content and happy. The cycle of cause and effect, the 'six realms of reincarnation,' cannot be escaped."

Mentioning the "six realms of reincarnation" brings to mind that Mr. Ding must be a Buddhist. Yes, he is not only a devout Buddhist but also a deeply learned Buddhist scholar. His worldview arises entirely from his religious beliefs. Before the age of forty, he was influenced by Wang Chong's "Discourses Weighed in the Balance" and believed that when a person "dies, they die, and death is the end." It was not until he was forty-one that he realized that death is not the end. He told a story, though its content may be strange and bizarre, it is still one of his interesting anecdotes.

He said: When I was forty-one years old, a neighbor's daughter suddenly developed a strange illness. She was possessed by three "hairy ghosts" who spoke with a Hunan accent. Their words were expressed entirely through the sick girl. Someone who knew that she was possessed by ghosts went to buy half a pig's head as a sacrifice. Unexpectedly, the three ghosts, through the girl's mouth, said, "How is half a pig's head enough for the three of us brothers to eat!" So the family then prepared to slaughter another chicken to entertain their three esteemed guests. But because no one in the house knew how to slaughter a chicken, they took it out to ask someone to do it for them. Unexpectedly, as the chicken was about to be taken out the door, the girl possessed by the evil spirit opened her mouth again and said, "We want to eat this chicken, don't take it out." ... I have often experienced similar events since then and realized that death is not the end. In this way, I slowly embarked on the path of faith in Buddhism.

The Human World is Fundamentally Suffering

Due to his religious beliefs, he felt that the human world is fundamentally a place of suffering, and there is no joy whatsoever in the work one does for personal gain. Life only becomes joyful when one returns to the Western "Pure Land." However, he is different from selfish and self-serving chanting old women. He is not satisfied with personal rebirth in the Pure Land; he believes that the world will only be truly blissful when all sentient beings can be reborn in the Pure Land. Therefore, he does not escape the challenges of reality but instead tries to save the masses of beings in this defiled world. This has cultivated in him a worldview of serving humanity.

He believes that what he gives to others is what truly belongs to him. In addition to devoting his life to practicing medicine and writing, he likes to collect books and ancient coins, but he does not hoard what he has collected for his own use but shares it with others. He once said with great emotion: "I am a man of moderate wealth, scrimping on food, clothing, entertainment, and hobbies, wanting to buy hundreds of thousands of volumes of books. The difficulty and hardship are incalculable compared to the wealthy who collect ancient books for aesthetic pleasure... Everyone should serve society, do things that benefit humanity, and not engage in selfish pursuits... If every book collector could make their collections available to scholars for communal reading, it would reduce the disappointment of scholars, avoid the criticism of hoarding and neglecting knowledge, and the result would be that not only scholars would benefit immensely, but also our country's academic culture would be enhanced, without a doubt." Following his beliefs, he donated tens of thousands of books to the Wuxi Library, the former Shanghai Municipal Library, and the Aurora University Library, among others, and established the Ding Family Library for public reading. He also expressed that as long as someone would donate a library site, he would donate his entire collection of books. He collected ancient coins for fifty years, amassing a great collection. Yet he generously donated them to schools, libraries, and museums in various places. He also plans to hold an ancient coin exhibition soon, with all ticket revenue going to charity!

Buddhist scriptures say: "What is given away is mine; what is kept at home is not mine; what is given away is secure; what is kept at home is insecure." Old Master Ding understands Buddhist principles deeply, hence he can do this.

### Record of Ms. Gu Mofei's Art Exhibition

The painter Ms. Gu Mofei will be holding a solo exhibition of her latest works (several dozen pieces) at the Women's Bank Building on Nanjing Road, second floor, from the 25th to the 29th (9:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily). Those in Shanghai who admire Ms. Mofei's poetry and painting are happily ordering her work, creating a situation where her paintings are as sought after as paper in Luoyang [idiom for popular work].

I have long been familiar with Ms. Mofei's clear, remote, and uninhibited painting style. However, in recent years, her work has been imbued with a heroic spirit. Yesterday, I saw her horizontal scroll with craggy peaks gushing like springs, and ancient pines spreading their wings like roc birds, shaping the wind and clouds. The tones of Ms. Gu Mofei in the past were clear and elegant, but now they are clear and majestic. The Huangshan School has been popular recently, which is not without grandeur, but compared to Ms. Gu's work, one only feels that the artistic charm is different. Painters naturally regard artistic charm as the most important thing. If the energy is pure and the charm is pure, then ancient simplicity is acceptable, elegance is acceptable, and heroic wonder is also acceptable. Knowing this is the key to reading Ms. Gu's paintings. Mingshan wrote a poem for Ms. Gu's paintings: "Who is like you in obtaining pure energy? The simple ink reveals the spirit. From now on, I recognize the趣 of Yunlin [Ni Zan]; I do not wish to walk in the general's painting." I think this poem still has some discrepancies. Yunlin captures the spirit with simplicity and remoteness, but Ms. Gu has a clear and splendid quality in her simplicity and remoteness. This is what Yunlin lacks. However, Yunlin's poetic style is indeed clear and splendid. Ms. Gu seems to have combined Yunlin's poetry and painting for her paintings, but her painting is unattainable. Ms. Gu's poems and lyrics have been compiled into volumes, but none have been published yet. Her landscape paintings are particularly outstanding. One line says, "I beg for banana seeds in front of the courtyard, only wanting a clear shade covering half the sky." Ms. Gu once studied painting with Huang Binhong, emphasizing outlines, simple but elegant, simple but abundant. The "begging for seeds in front of the courtyard" line may implicitly indicate the origin of her style, but Ms. Gu has already surpassed Mr. Huang's skill. Although the poem has a self-assured tone, it is actually a modest expression. (Mingshan)

### Tram Avoiding Pedestrian Crashes into and Destroys Two Trees

At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a route 17 trolleybus (number 237) was speeding south on Rue du Père Froc in the French Concession when a local cashier from the Jinhua Coal Ball Company, Zhou Lianrong, was walking in front of the bus. The tram driver swerved sharply to avoid him, but inadvertently ran onto the sidewalk and knocked down a large tree on the side of the road.

### Hesitant Investment, Chinese Stocks Prices Remain Low

It seems that people's sentiment has slightly changed, and as a result, market prices uniformly rose by 0.10 to 0.50 yuan. The transaction volume was about 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

### New Lead Wire: Shortage of Goods and Firm Prices

The circulation of new lead wire in the market has recently been quite tight. It has been found that the source of goods was cut off early, and the stock in this port is also thin. As a result, after daily searches, the market goods are becoming increasingly scarce. There is concern about shortages soon. In recent days, there has been a surge of inquiries in the market, and purchases have also increased. As a result, the market situation is very firm, and the atmosphere is enthusiastic. The asking price is greatly affected by the shortage of colors and is extremely high. Currently, colors from number 8 to number 15 are selling for 22,000 yuan per ton, colors from number 16 to number 20 are selling for 24,000 yuan per ton, and colors from number 21 to number 25 are being quoted at 27,000 yuan per ton. The single pick of number 25 fine color is even more scarce, and the market price may not stop there, and some are even selling for 30,000 yuan per ton. In addition, sales of other goods are scarce due to high prices, such as 2,000-pound black iron billets, which sell for 16,000 yuan per ton, and white lead wire, which also requires 16,000 yuan per ton. New plate numbers 4, 5, and 6 are 16,000 yuan per ton, and cement steel is 10,500 yuan per ton.

### Regarding the Mystery of Mei Lanfang's Whereabouts, Related Parties Report that He Will Arrive in Shanghai

— Master of the Plum Blossom Hall

Regarding the whereabouts of Mei Lanfang, there are many rumors and different opinions. Some say that he arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month, while others say that he just arrived here a few days ago. Still others say that he is still living peacefully in Hong Kong and has not taken a step beyond. When asked, the servants of the Mei residence said that the master has not been here at all. The rumors are confusing and there is no consensus.

When Fu Dewei was in Shanghai last month, he sent a letter to his family saying that Mei had indeed returned to Shanghai and that he had seen him in person. He also said that Mei's finances were not very generous and that he would have to resume his old profession, resuming his theatrical career. In the near future, he might go north to express his accumulated feelings to old friends. This news was published prominently in the Shanghai New Tianjin Pictorial with a large headline. The editor's note said: "The news from Dewei's family should be reliable, and what he said seems credible. However, the world is constantly changing, and whether it is really reliable remains to be proven by facts." Dewei is a kind person and is known as a Mr. Nice Guy in the theater troupe. The news that "Mei has arrived in Shanghai and has seen him in person" coming from his pen seems to be credible, but it is too far from what I know, "Mei is still in Hong Kong."

The night before yesterday (the 21st), I met Mr. Li Zulai (Assistant Manager of the Bank of China) at Lido Garden. According to him, Lanfang is indeed still in Hong Kong. A telegram came a few days ago saying: "Lan is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 19th." However, he has not arrived in the past two days. It is thought that the hurricane has disrupted transportation. Friends here expect that they will be able to shake hands with Mei at the airport in two or three days. It can be said with certainty.

Li is a frequent correspondent with Mei, and he is the most knowledgeable about Mei's news. Therefore, I have written this short article based on his words to tell the readers.

### "The Grand View Garden on the Sea" Premieres

— Yiqing

Zhu Shilin's lively handling of comedy gave us a deep impression in "Wildflowers Are Not as Fragrant as Home Flowers." Now it is a further step forward, followed by a contribution of "The Grand View Garden on the Sea".

The performance of this film is easy and lively, which not only conforms to the principles of comedy, but also has a wider range of topics. It is bold and ruthless, exposing the cruelty and selfishness between people.

It is such a story: it tells the story of a gatekeeper who, after marrying a poor seamstress, saves money and tries his best to search, and finally becomes the only big real estate businessman on the sea. Unfortunately, he has no children, so he widely accepts adopted sons and daughters, but they (his wife and a bookkeeper, Yuan Sheng, are included) are only taking advantage of the opportunity to win a fortune. It was too late when he realized it.

We don't have to say who this is alluding to. Anyway, in all walks of life in Shanghai, stories similar to this are really heard and seen anytime and anywhere. It is worth mentioning that Mei Xi plays the stingy real estate businessman in "The Grand View Garden on the Sea". Regardless of his appearance or actions, he is extremely vivid and appropriate. From now on, we will give Mei Xi a new evaluation.

### Ma Lianliang is Blessed with a Son

Ma Lianliang has been singing in the old capital recently and his reputation is growing. After the autumn cools down, there is news that he will come to Shanghai again. It is not certain. Mr. Ma recently had a son, and yesterday was the first month celebration. His friends at sea congratulated him, because he had been infertile for many years and suddenly had a son, which shows the devotion of his couple and deserves congratulations.

### New Gimmicks in Peking Opera, Co-Stage Rehearses "Home"

— Tianyi

Zhao Ruquan Plays Old Master Gao

Shanghai's Peking Opera can probably be divided into two categories: one is the Peking-style big-name actors, who follow the rules and regulations, and the other is the continuous dramas, which are full of gimmicks. The latter is centered around the Co-Stage, which has been booming for ten years and has a thriving business. Recently, "The Legend of the White Snake" has been divided into two parts, with real snakes, real water, real clouds, and real fire, and has sold out for more than a month. Shanghainese people love excitement, and the Co-Stage has experts who study the audience's tastes and are 100% accurate. It's really wonderful. Unexpectedly, after "The Legend of the White Snake", the Co-Stage will rehearse "Home". "Home" is Ba Jin's famous work. The New China Company mobilized all its stars to make a movie, and the stage's leading figures co-starred in a drama. Now, it is the "actors" of the Co-Stage who are playing the "Home". It is said that Zhao Ruquan will play Old Master Gao, Chen Xiaosheng will play Juexin, Li Ruchun will play Juehui, Chen Guilan will play Mingfeng, and Wang Baolian will play Aunt Chen. They will all appear on stage in modern costumes, without drums and gongs, in a drama style. However, the drama only has four or five acts, but they have forty or fifty acts, focusing on the scenery and adding enough insertions. It is expected that this will be another new gimmick that Shanghainese people will flock to. In order to find a few hours of happiness, open their mouths and laugh, it might be worth seeing. Shanghai's Peking Opera will truly be "a completely different look".

### Lang Deshan Takes the Stage Tomorrow

Technician Lang Deshan, at the request of friends, is scheduled to perform a large set of techniques and magic at the Grand Theater tomorrow (Sunday). At the same time, the New Kaleidoscope Troupe will also rehearse brand-new programs. The cooperation of these two major art troupes, one with great supernatural powers and the other with joyful singing and dancing, will surely make the audience smile with joy.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— Hejia Branch

(7) Thunder

Mrs. Ye returned the will to Cuizhen and instructed her: "Put it back where you found it. I need to think about this matter before I speak." Cuizhen carefully put it back under the glass mat, still happy that Weicheng had not returned to the room from the Shuangmei Study. Cuizhen discovered this secret and also looked worried, just like Weicheng. Looking at Mrs. Ye again, Mrs. Ye was no longer in the mood to flip through the account books and plan. In the evening, the wind was still howling, and it didn't snow, but there was a burst of snow pellets. Cuizhen was mending an old piece of clothing in Mrs. Ye's room. Mrs. Ye asked, "Are they all asleep?" Cuizhen said, "I think they're asleep. The magpie shouted cold and wanted to sleep early." Mrs. Ye said, "Go see if Chengdi is asleep. If he's not asleep, call him. I know he's extremely sad." Cuizhen said, "If Chengdi comes, should I come with him?" Mrs. Ye said, "Come too."

Cuizhen was ordered to call Weicheng. She was afraid that Weicheng would be alarmed, so she didn't suddenly go to his room, but only called outside the room, "Chengdi, are you not asleep? Second Aunt asks you to go to her room, she has something to tell you." Weicheng replied, "Coming soon." Cuizhen returned to Mrs. Ye's room, and Weicheng also came. He smiled reluctantly, "Aunt, what do you want me for?" In Mrs. Ye's room, there was a small square table, one side against the wall, and people could sit on three sides. Mrs. Ye and Cuizhen had already sat down on both sides, and Weicheng sat down on the empty side. Mrs. Ye looked at Weicheng under the lamp, and even more saw that Weicheng was a picture of worry that could hurt people. She first pressed Weicheng's shoulders and said, "There are only three of us here, no outsiders. I know your business, that is, you saw your mother's will." Weicheng opened his mouth, wanting to speak, but couldn't say anything. Mrs. Ye said, "Where was your mother's will placed?" Weicheng's eyelids were already a little wet, and he replied, "It was found in an old book." (137)
