### Germany Launches 800,000-Strong General Offensive on Stalingrad; Aircraft Repeatedly Bomb the Entire City into a Sea of Fire; Vanguard Only 20-Odd Miles from the Volga River

Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Vichy radio broadcast today, the German vanguard has reached Aganerovo, 25 miles southwest of Stalingrad. It is said that the German army is no more than 20 miles from the Volga River.

Stockholm, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to Reuters, General Bock's 800,000-strong army has begun a general offensive on Stalingrad. German forces are attacking from the north, southwest, and south. The city's defending forces, under the command of Timoshenko, are now facing a serious crisis. The railway south of the city leading to Moscow has been cut off by German troops, making Soviet supply extremely difficult. In the future, the Soviet army will only be able to use the Volga River's middle reaches at Saratov and the Gamsli River to its south. German troops have advanced to a location more than 60 kilometers northwest of the city, so the fall of the city is imminent. According to news from London, ships in the Volga River port are still operating as usual, and shops are also open for business as usual.

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced last night that German mechanized units southwest of Stalingrad, after extremely fierce fighting, have broken through the 20-kilometer-deep Soviet defense line. The line had hundreds of pillboxes. Although the Soviet army resisted with all its might, the fortresses fell into German hands one after another. Many Soviet artillery positions were destroyed, and several enemy units were annihilated by concentrated artillery fire.

Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) – According to an Associated Press report from Moscow, the German forces attacking Stalingrad, together with the newly arrived elite troops, now exceed one million. German forces from the northwest and south have advanced to the city's defense line. The German side is using tank units as the vanguard to advance forward. At the same time, infantry and bicycle units are using parachutes to land behind the Soviet lines, attacking from the front and rear. The Soviet army is thus encircled and unable to resist.

Stockholm, 26th (Havas Agency) – For the past 24 hours, both German and Soviet sides have confirmed that the situation for the defending forces in the Stalingrad and Caucasus regions is increasingly unfavorable. In the Stalingrad area, the German pincer movement has been gradually intensified yesterday and last night. German mechanized units in the north are rushing towards the town of Dubavka, 30 miles from the city. The southwestern route is now only 25 miles from Stalingrad. German troops on the front, after crossing the Don River, are concentrating their forces to prepare for an attack on the city. Soviet troops are defending along the city, ordered to hold fast and not retreat. According to news from Moscow, German troops have been using paratroopers in groups of 50 to 100 men, landing behind the defending forces. These paratroopers are equipped with new-style infantry weapons. Following the paratroopers are airborne transport units, providing continuous reinforcements. These units are also carrying light tanks.

Stockholm, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to a British Central Fast Radio broadcast, the threat to Stalingrad from the south is greater than from the north, because the German forces advancing from the north and south are making rapid progress in their operations. Tanks and mechanized units, under air cover, continue to advance. Although the Soviet army is putting up a desperate resistance, it is ultimately difficult to stop them due to the superior German forces. Moreover, this area is a flat, open plain with no natural obstacles favorable to Soviet defense. The Soviet army has no choice but to retreat. Another German force is launching a fierce attack on Astrakhan, west of the Volga River estuary.

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the German High Command, German planes have fiercely bombed Stalingrad, causing fires everywhere. The entire city has become a sea of fire. Factories and railway stations have been destroyed, and oil refineries and fuel depots have also been hit and exploded.

Istanbul, 26th (Allied News Agency) – German planes bombed Stalingrad all night on Monday, causing a massive fire in the city that spread widely. Residents have been mobilized to carry out firefighting work, while volunteer labor teams are rushing to build defensive fortifications in the suburbs.

Conscripting Elite Troops to the Front Lines; Soviets Prepare for a Death Struggle

Zurich, 25th (Havas Agency) – The "National New Paper" recently published news from Moscow stating that General Timoshenko has transferred a large number of troops near Stalingrad, including 17 infantry divisions, 7 armored brigades, and a large number of artillery units and motorized infantry, stationed in Stalingrad and around the city, laying minefields.

An Area on the Ukrainian Border, 25th (Havas Agency) – It is reported that fierce fighting is currently underway between the Don River and the Volga River. German forces are strong and have established a bridgehead on the Don River. The Soviet army is also resisting with all its might, but the German position is already stable, and a large number of fresh troops and equipment are arriving at the front continuously. On the Soviet side, tanks and aircraft are also being used to try to stop the German advance, but so far, it has been ineffective. In addition, elite troops, such as the Soviet Guards and women's units, have been conscripted to the front to help in the battle. It is estimated that the Soviet forces in this area are no less than two million, with thousands of tanks and aircraft. At the same time, the Soviet air force is also extremely active, carrying out low-level bombings, like mobile artillery batteries. However, the Soviet defense line is composed of countless small bunkers, scattered like stars in the sky, numbering in the thousands, making it extremely difficult to achieve effective results by bombing from the sky. The German army now understands that it can only win by bombing and destroying the Soviet bunkers. According to military observers, although the Soviet army is fighting extremely bravely, the tactics and strategy of the German command are extremely superior, and the fate of the war has already been decided. Therefore, in this decisive battle, the German army will not only be able to occupy Stalingrad but also annihilate Timoshenko's large army. Southwest of Stalingrad, the Soviet army launched a counterattack, engaging in bayonet fighting as many as 22 times in a single day. This area is a vast, boundless grassland. Recently, due to the scorching sun, the ground is dry and the grass is withered. If it catches fire, it will spread like wildfire. On one occasion, the dry grass caught fire, and dense smoke filled the air. The Soviet army took advantage of this smoke screen to retreat. The front lines lack water, and the German army relies solely on the water in their own canteens for supply.

Moscow, 25th (Havas Agency) – The Red Army High Command recently issued a battle report stating, "In the past 24 hours, our army has continued to fight southeast of Kletskaia, northwest of Kotelnikovo, and south of Krasnodar. Among them, the battle situation on the line southeast of Kletskaia seems to be deteriorating. Our air force participated vigorously in the battle over Stalingrad. Fierce hand-to-hand combat has occurred south of Krasnodar and is still ongoing. There have been no major changes in other war zones."

### New Zealand Prime Minister Arrives in Washington

Lisbon, 25th (Allied News Agency) – Washington reports that New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser arrived in Washington on the 25th. His visit to the United States is at the invitation of Roosevelt, and the main purpose is to discuss the Pacific War situation.

Highest Peak of the Western Caucasus; German Flag Waves in the Wind

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced yesterday that several mountain passes in the Western Caucasus have been seized. Since last Friday, the German flag has been fluttering on the summit of Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in the Caucasus. German troops, on the main road through the Caucasus, can overlook the sunny plains and the sparkling Black Sea.

Stockholm, 25th (Havas Agency) – The news that the German flag is already flying on the summit of Mount Elbrus has caused great excitement among military observers here. They say that the German occupation of this high mountain has no major value in itself, and that the Red Army probably did not know to defend the roads leading to the mountain. However, the prowess and skill of the German mountain troops are noteworthy. Mount Elbrus is the highest peak in the Caucasus Mountains. Only a British man climbed to the summit in 1868. The Caucasus mountain range is a natural obstacle to the German attack on the Baku oil fields. Now that the German army has occupied Mount Elbrus, it shows that it can overcome natural obstacles. As for the mountain passes from the north to the south of the Caucasus, namely the two major mountain passes of Marukh and Klukhorsky, there is no doubt that they are now occupied by the German army. Based on this, the German army has overcome one of the most difficult stages of its operations on the Eastern Front. The German army has now reached the plains of Sukhumi and Batumi. However, in terms of the terrain of the Caucasus Mountains, the southern slopes are actually steeper than the northern slopes, so it is most ideal for the local people to engage in guerrilla warfare.

### Stalingrad Evacuates Civilians; Important Industries Moved to the Rear

### Fate of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet Uncertain

Stockholm, 25th (Allied News Agency)

The fate of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet after the German invasion of the Caucasus has attracted worldwide attention. According to well-informed sources in London, the fleet consists of one 26,000-ton battleship, two cruisers, about 25 destroyers, 50 submarines, and many other fast boats and small vessels. It is believed that if Novorossiysk falls, the fleet will likely flee to Batumi.

Ankara, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – Turkish sources here expect that a large number of Soviet warships and merchant ships will soon enter Turkish seaports. This prediction is apparently based on the Soviet envoy's inquiry with the Turkish government as to whether Soviet ships could be temporarily sheltered in Turkish ports during the war. It is reported that the Turkish government has given a positive response, but neither the Soviet application nor the Turkish response has been officially confirmed. If Soviet ships want to enter Turkish Black Sea ports, they would likely be temporarily docked in İzmit.

The Republican mouthpiece, "Seguro," recently published an article commenting on this, arguing that this action reiterated Portugal's neutrality, stating, "The government's expression of friendship to Brazil not only represents the emotions of the people but also demonstrates our determination to defend our neutrality. Because only by strictly adhering to neutrality can we earn the unanimous respect of all countries. Therefore, pursuing a policy of neutrality is essential for our country."

### Indian Representative to the Pacific Military Council Suggests Improving the Situation in India; Flies to London to Present Plan to Authorities

Lisbon, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to Reuters, New Delhi, the British authorities are continuing to arrest key figures of the National Congress Party. After Gandhi's newspaper, the Harijan Weekly, was ordered to cease publication on the 22nd, the Indian people were deeply angered. Newspapers run by Indians in Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, Nagpur, Lucknow, Madras, and Pune have all voluntarily ceased publication in protest. This provides further evidence that the anti-British movement in India is unfolding in an organized manner. Demonstrations by Indians are still occurring frequently. On the 25th, clashes occurred between the police and civilians in various parts of the Central Provinces, resulting in four deaths and many injuries. In Calcutta, a crowd of people demonstrated and marched, and in Bombay, Indians prevented Americans from entering and exiting the courthouse.

Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from London, British officials say that Gandhi's letter to the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, will not be published. The letter only refutes the arguments for arresting members of the National Congress Party. Well-informed sources in London express optimism due to the improved atmosphere in India.

Other topics, such as improving the organization of wartime production and enhancing social legislation, will also be discussed.

### British Headquarters Established in Iran and Iraq; Responsible for Defending the Caucasus and Asia Minor; Rumor that South African Troops Will Attack Libya from Egypt

Zurich, 25th (Havas Agency) – The New Zurich Daily's London correspondent reports that the British High Command in Iran and Iraq was established yesterday. This is just a formality. The government made this decision because the number of British troops in these areas has greatly increased, and the issue of supplies is becoming increasingly important. In the past, these troops were controlled by the British Middle East Command in Cairo or the British Indian Command in New Delhi. However, in reality, their locations were far from these two commands and unrelated. The Cairo Command was responsible for the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, while the Indian Command's authority did not extend beyond the Persian Gulf. After yesterday's reorganization, the Cairo Middle East Command will now have Syria and Palestine as its right flank and the Egyptian desert as its left flank. Its main task will be to defend Malta and the Al Alamein area. The newly established Iraq-Iran High Command will be individually commanded by General Wilson, responsible for defending the Caucasus and possibly even Anatolia (i.e., Asia Minor). Therefore, Commander Wavell of India will also have more flexibility. It is believed that when Prime Minister Churchill met with South African Defense Forces Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister Smuts in Cairo, they discussed expanding South African participation in defending the Middle East. There is reason to believe that all parties concerned have completed preparations for sending a large number of South African troops to Egypt to assist in the attack on Libya.

The Industrial Chemical Raw Material Dealers' Association of this city has always restricted the application for moving industrial chemical raw materials to its members.

If their applications are rejected outright, the materials will be stranded and suffer losses. If they are treated the same as members, it would not be in line with the original regulations. Therefore, the association has resolved to adopt flexible measures. Any non-member who possesses industrial chemical raw materials may register with the association as a temporary member (without paying membership fees or dues) from now until September 9th. They can then apply to move the materials and pay a handling fee. However, this is limited to selling out and does not allow purchasing.

### Resolution of Water Cutoff Incident on Avenue Joffre

The resolution of the water supply dispute at premises on 1270 Lane, Avenue Joffre, has been reported previously. It is now known that the premises are leased by French lawyer Plémel, with a monthly rent of 90 yuan per building. In the spring of this year, the tenant proposed to the tenants a rent increase of 400 percent. Water fees were also to be shared by the tenants, and the previous indefinite leases were to be abandoned and fixed-term leases signed, with other conditions. The tenants agreed to share the water fees, which had been increased several times by the company, to be borne by the landlord, and were also willing to resolve the rent increase fairly. However, the tenant, failing to get his way, suddenly stopped supplying water to the lane from July 20th. After repeated negotiations, no resolution was reached for a long time. Later, lawyer Lan Xuzhang, representing the tenants, appealed to the French Concession Bureau of Public Health and the Police Department, etc. After investigation by personnel, the authorities ordered the tenant to restore the water supply to its original state. The residents of the lane, after being without water for more than a month, were overjoyed to have water once again.

### Autumn Sun Rages, Epidemic Atmosphere Cannot Be Ignored

Since the day before yesterday, all temporary cholera vaccination sites in the city have stopped vaccinations. However, the number of citizens suffering from the epidemic is still quite high. Yesterday, a visit to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at 25 Yuqiaqing Road revealed that the hospital still had 676 outpatients on the 25th, and 160 inpatients. This year's weather has been extremely hot. Although it has decreased since the beginning of autumn, the autumn sun is still raging, and the heat has not subsided. Most citizens are still sleeping outdoors in search of coolness, which is inevitable. As a result, those suffering from the epidemic are constantly seeking treatment at the hospital. The hospital is still providing round-the-clock consultations, the same as in the height of summer. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to hygiene and not seek coolness at the expense of their health.

### After Implementation of Rural Clearing in Shanghai Suburbs, Traffic is Partially Blocked; Those Entering and Exiting Blockade Lines on Official Business May Apply for Special Permits

After the official establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Rural Clearing Committee, rural clearing will begin in Fengxian and other districts. All unnecessary traffic in the rural clearing areas of each district will be separately blocked, as a measure of strengthening defenses and clearing the fields. However, for those who must enter and exit the blockade line on official business, their names should be submitted in a roster to the branch for the issuance of a special permit to facilitate passage.

### Management Office to File Complaint Against Second Landlords Refusing to Obtain Licenses

Datong News Agency reports that personnel from the Rental Property License Management Office in the Public Works Department Building on Hankou Road told reporters that the deadline for second landlords in the Public Concession to obtain licenses expired on the 15th of this month. Starting the next day, a fine of 10 yuan was added. It is now learned that starting on the first day of next month, an additional fine of 5 yuan will be added for any second landlord who goes to obtain a license, as a form of punishment. However, if they still fail to obtain a license after September 15th, the office will send personnel to file a complaint with the court.

### Overseas Nationals of North and South American Countries at War with Japan Urged to Apply for Evacuation; Most American Nationals in Shanghai Will Evacuate

According to Masaki, a translator at the Japanese Consulate General, approximately 1,250 nationals of North and South American countries will board the repatriation ships Conte Verde and Asama Maru in early September for Lorenzo Marques. Of these, only about 100 or 150 will depart from Japan, with the remainder being North and South American people residing in China.

Filipino Nationals Going to America Also Need to Apply

The Conte Verde will arrive in Shanghai first on September 5th or 6th, and the Asama Maru will arrive about a day later. The two ships will also carry Filipinos who wish to go to America. Those who wish to return to the Philippines are not included. Filipino nationals who wish to take this opportunity to go to America must apply directly to the Japanese Consulate General. It was previously reported that the Conte Verde and Asama Maru would carry 1,500 people, but in reality, the two ships can only accommodate about 1,250 people. Although there are no detailed figures for the number of repatriated nationals, it is generally believed that most of the 1,364 American nationals in Shanghai will leave for Lorenzo Marques.

Repatriation Ships Still the Previous Two

Also, according to officials at the Swedish Consulate, the rumor that there is only one repatriation ship leaving Shanghai is incorrect. As for whether the Conte Verde and Asama Maru will leave Shanghai on the same day, or leave one or two days apart, it is not known. It has been announced that nationals of Central, South, and North American countries at war with Japan who wish to be repatriated must apply to the Japanese Consulate General immediately, otherwise they will not be evacuated. Canadian nationals must register with the Swiss Consulate General before Saturday.

### Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters Issues Announcement on Blackout Performance; Generally Satisfied with Exercise Results

According to the Allied News Agency, the city conducted its first blackout drill on the evening of the 25th, lasting for four hours. The results were very good. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued Announcement No. 6 on the 26th, detailing the status of implementation in each district during the exercise and providing instructions, hoping that citizens would pay attention to improvements. The main points of the announcement are as follows:

Results in Each District

The blackout in the Public Concession was excellent, but many lights near Zhao Zhou Road and the Hankou Road area west of Fujian Road leaked into the sky and should be noted. The blackout in the Shanghai Municipal Government-administered area was satisfactory, but many lights in the western area of the North Railway Station leaked into the sky and should be noted. Many lights were exposed in the city, although the light power was not significant, it was inappropriate for air defense. The blackout in the French Concession was excellent. The blackout on the river was very good. No light leakage from high-rise buildings, which is excellent.

Points for Improvement

In summary, the blackout drill was achieved due to the enthusiastic guidance of the relevant agencies and the extraordinary efforts of the implementers. The goal of blackout was achieved in a short period of time, with better results than the usual first exercise. However, in the details of implementation, there are still many points that need to be improved. They are listed as follows:

Many people did not implement measures such as dimming, covering, and concealing lights as required, but simply turned off the lights. This is a temporary expedient for a short period of exercise and is not practical. In the future, permanent solutions should be considered and preparations should be made for long-term alert control.

The purpose of the blackout control is to continue business as usual and work normally. In order to thoroughly implement this purpose and promote the completion of formal blackout facilities, exercises may be of long duration in the future. Therefore, preparations should be made in advance.

If the specified measures in the blackout control are not implemented and only the lights are turned off, there is a risk that the lights may be turned on due to circumstances or that huge direct light may be exposed to the outside. Therefore, light bulbs that are not used in the room should be removed in advance.

Torches must be covered and the light must be reduced to the minimum necessary.

Public buses generally travel too fast. The speed should be reduced in accordance with the degree of dimming of the headlights to avoid danger. The light power of the taillights of cars is also generally too high.

Pedestrians walk in the middle of the road, as the volume of traffic has decreased. This is dangerous.

In many courtyard-style houses, although attention has been paid to light leakage on the outside, there is still light leakage on the inside. It must be known that the light from the inside can also be seen from the sky, so attention should be paid to everything.

Since the air raid alarm was not pre-announced, exercises may not be pre-announced in the future. Therefore, a method for rapid transmission of alarms should also be researched and concrete measures should be established.

If street lights are not extinguished, they appear like an open map from the sky. Therefore, remaining lights should be adjusted, dimming equipment should be installed, and the lampshades should be improved to prevent light from being seen above the horizontal.

During blackout control and when an alert is issued, glass windows may be opened.

Whether or not air defense facilities are complete often depends on the attention of the housewife of the household. In addition, air defense education in elementary and middle schools has a significant impact on the popularization of air defense ideas. Moreover, air defense is practiced in major cities around the world, not just Shanghai. It is hoped that Shanghai officials and citizens will make greater efforts to work on air defense.

Concealment Design Still Needs Research

The Public Works Department's Information Office announced that the city's blackout drill on the evening of the 25th of this month was a first. In general, the results were satisfactory. The citizens of the concession cooperated with the Bureau in this blackout exercise, which resulted in good results. The Bureau is grateful and hopes that citizens will pay attention to the concealment of lights in shops, offices, and homes so that they cannot be seen outdoors during the day, and design them well. When a blackout drill is conducted again in the future, it will be possible to continue business as usual and not feel too much inconvenience indoors. If they follow the advice of the authorities, the indoor lighting equipment can be adjusted, and in the event of an air raid, they can still live and work in peace, without hindering the welfare of the citizens. All citizens are fortunate to understand this.

### British National MacKenzie Arrested for Fraud; Investigating Authorities Not Yet Determined; Attempted to Stow Away on Repatriation Ship Unsuccessful; Sustained Himself with "Gimmicks" After Losing His Job

According to the Shanghai Times, British national MacKenzie, 26, formerly a reporter at the American Wireless Relay (call sign XMHA), has been arrested in the French Concession on suspicion of fraud, after two months of investigation by the Public Concession Police.

Arrested in the French Concession

He was handed over to the Public Concession police yesterday (the 15th) and taken to the First Special Court, from where he was sent back into custody, pending a decision by the relevant authorities on whether the British national would be tried in the court or at the consulate. It is reported that MacKenzie previously worked for Great American Telegraph, where he was dismissed for neglecting his duties. He then used the pretext of selling coffee to defraud Mr. Kit Xu Yin, a news commentator in this city, and Miss Bovey Zaggia, a Russian woman, of 1,000 yuan each.

Multiple Accusations Received

One was from refugee Hai Ying Suosi, who accused MacKenzie of stealing a camera and several pieces of leather, worth a total of 1,700 yuan, from his residence at 1819 Dong Xi Huade Road last Friday. However, when the French police arrested MacKenzie, they only found 1 yuan 8 jiao and a health certificate on him. When handed over to the Public Concession Police, MacKenzie admitted that he had attempted to stow away on the Conte Verde, which was recently carrying Allied nationals out of Shanghai, but had failed. When MacKenzie was arrested, he showed the French Police Department a Hong Kong Navy pass and a British Navy dockyard pass, but had no passport.

Inquiries Made with the Swiss Consul-General

It was learned that he was indeed British. It is reported that Kit Xu Yin reported MacKenzie's fraud to the police on June 18, and investigators were sent out, and he was finally arrested near Foch Road and Avenue Albert. According to MacKenzie, a Danish national had asked him to sell Meihe Coffee, and he consulted with Kit Xu Yin, who bought 100 cans, each at 55 yuan. He paid with a Yi Hua Bank check on May 27 and promised to deliver the goods on May 28. However, the Danish national suddenly refused to sell because the price of the coffee had risen. MacKenzie could not find the brand of coffee elsewhere, and the deposit money had already been used.

Used for "Living Expenses"

In addition, he also obtained a deposit of 1,000 yuan from Russian woman Bovey Zaggia under the pretext of selling Meihe Coffee, which he had also used up. According to police investigations, MacKenzie has been unemployed for some time and has been sustaining himself with "gimmicks."

At the beginning of the morning, the buying force first pulled up Type B, and it suddenly rose by seven jiao, rising to 9 yuan and 4 jiao at the opening. Although the sellers once exerted pressure in the middle of the session and the market weakened, the rest also weakened slightly. However, due to the strong intention of the buyers, they all pulled up unanimously. Judging from the brisk closing of each bond, people's hearts were mostly firm. If there is no considerable supply, the trend may not turn weak. The result of the ups and downs of each bond was a unanimous increase of 2 to 6 jiao. The turnover was about 1.1 million yuan. The list is as follows:

### Cotton Cloth Market Continues to Rise, Although There Were Setbacks in the Middle, Buying Sentiment Recovered in the Afternoon

Taohua Lady Lin Cloth opened at 259 yuan, rose to 260 yuan and 5 jiao, and then was suppressed to 257 yuan and a half in the afternoon due to the decline in Dongpi Hua Ji, as retail investors took the opportunity to sell. But in the afternoon, the buying sentiment was strong, and it tended to rise again, with a maximum price of 258 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and a closing price of 258 yuan and 5 jiao, an increase of 2 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous day.

### High-Grade Cigarettes Are Dim

The cigarette market is difficult to sell in reality. High- and middle-grade goods are even more bleak. The sales of second-grade goods have not decreased, so the prices are brisk, which is why vendors are collecting them. Yesterday, the opening price of Great British Brand was 8,150 yuan, Old Knife Brand was 5,600 yuan, Pinhai Brand was 5,050 yuan, Fairy Brand was 4,100 yuan, and Wuhua Brand was 4,000 yuan. There were very few transactions, so the prices were still weak.

### Teacher's Day, Teachers Anxious!

— Yangzijiang

Today is again the annual Teacher's Day. In theory, everyone should congratulate the teachers, and the teachers should also feel happy.

However, looking back at the treatment that teachers have suffered from society, we cannot help but feel deep sympathy and unease. Today, we feel that the arrival of Teacher's Day has a very special meaning.

Due to social unrest and abnormal economic society; along with rising prices and the difficulty of daily life, teachers' real lives are feeling even more difficult. This is something worth worrying about for the teachers.

At this time, following this development, many teachers cannot continue to shoulder their sacred and great tasks with peace of mind and loyalty. Moreover, many teachers have opened "small differences" in the middle of the road. This has formed a bad tendency in the qualitative aspect of the current teachers, which is also something that everyone who cares about education should be anxious about.

Today, in addition to asking the social authorities to improve and improve the treatment of teachers who are struggling hard, we should also pay the highest respect to the general sincere and persistent teachers who shoulder sacred and great responsibilities!

### Hard Road

— Hanyuan

"Scholars are useless," in fact, the most useless is because they cannot make money, so in Shanghai in this year, scholars are useless, so they have to teach.

Now there are three difficulties in teaching: first, teaching is difficult, second, eating is difficult, and third, grading papers is difficult. It is difficult to teach because there are educational authorities, school authorities, parents, young and young students, plus the teacher's own personality and conscience, so it is difficult to teach now, and many teachers have changed their careers.

The second difficulty is eating. In the past few years, prices have risen by an average of 30 to 40 times, while teachers' salaries have only risen by 2 to 3 times, and some places have also been discounted. Originally, teaching was a hard job, but now it is even harder to bear. Those who can find a part-time job use their last bit of strength to do some part-time work; those who cannot have to do exploitative work on their own lives and health; so that now, people who are teachers (those who are long-term cannot be counted) cannot support their parents above, and cannot support their wives below, as for the enjoyment of raising education, it is even more impossible to talk about. Everything is just dealing with life, relying on its original physical strength to resist high prices.

The third difficulty is grading papers. The level of students is getting worse year by year, but the number of students is increasing year by year. Recently, the number of students in some schools has been slightly less than before, but the principals have abused the collection and merger of classes, and the work of teachers grading papers has not been reduced at all. Originally, there was little free time after teaching, and adding these many papers took up more time for teachers to find another way out or to study on their own. Yesterday, a friend came to talk about her new position as a third-grade class teacher in a primary school, with 30 hours a week and 82 students (naturally, she has to grade 82 papers), a monthly salary of 60 reserve tickets, without food and lodging, and the salary is paid in May, while the principal collects 3,000 yuan in tuition and miscellaneous fees from these 82 primary school students.

Because of these three difficulties, many teachers have changed their careers recently. It is not that their sense of responsibility is weaker, but because they have to change their careers, which everyone should forgive. However, the future of the country depends on education; the quality of teachers and the stability of the teaching profession are directly related to the entire education. Pushing teachers to this point is tantamount to forcing the entire younger generation to embark on a path of ignorance, which is really an extremely dangerous path for the entire nation.

I am a teacher. I have been a teacher for more than ten years since I left the normal university. Now, seeing Chinese teachers embark on this hard road, I feel less sad for the teachers, but more for the future of the country and the nation.

We do not need to appeal to teachers, and no industry has the responsibility to help another industry. The profession of teaching was originally chosen by the teachers themselves. Whether he initially went behind the podium as a starting point for lifelong service or a temporary attempt to solve the problem of life, he has no reason to complain about choosing this profession. It is only the current phenomenon that is too dangerous for the entire nation to send forward.

If everyone can think about the teacher problem—not the entire education problem—by taking advantage of Teacher's Day, that would be a good thing after all.

### Confession of a Chinese Teacher

— Kang Chao

Innocent children: I have been with you for two whole years. The relationship between us cannot be said to be very weak: From your joy in talking to me about your own affairs, and my not too afraid or unfamiliar attitude, I feel your trust in me, and I am deeply ashamed because of this.

Yes, I am teaching "seriously." However, the material itself that I teach (even if I am teaching seriously), can it really benefit you, is what I doubt. In class, I always explain some solemn classical Chinese, and I am very satisfied when I explain each word and sentence in it to make you all understand. I think I have made a small contribution. However, what can you learn from a classical Chinese article? Even if it is the Chu Ci or Han Fu with the widest use of vocabulary, at most there are only dozens of new words - and many of them are rare words that are not used now - some sentence patterns that you will imitate and use when writing articles will become clichés, and many decadent and corrupt ideas. If you have made progress in Chinese this semester, and say that this is all the result of my teaching, then I will be ashamed to sweat. Children, you have been deceived. This is the result of your reading books, newspapers and magazines outside of class, and the result of your loving to explore what you have seen and heard. How can I help us at all?

In this difficult and troubled era, your tuition fees for one semester may add white hair to your parents who are burdened by the burden of life, and maybe the solemn layer on your young faces is because some problems are torturing you. I pretend not to see all of this, and am too lazy to work hard to find some materials that meet your needs, but I still use the old things passed down by the teachers who taught me to teach me to prevaricate, which is really unforgivable.

I often say things that my conscience does not want me to say for my own safety and for my job. Many of the questions you study and the books and newspapers you read are things I don't understand, because I thought I had finished my studies after graduating from school. You are moving forward quickly, but I am stagnating in my original position, and I still have to pretend to understand what I don't understand, and answer the questions you ask irresponsibly, but you treat me as trustworthy and admirable.

In the quiet night, I can't help but feel heartbroken for our education, and I am deeply ashamed.

### Education

— Xiaozhi

Education is the most important thing in the world, but it is also the most poorly done, which explains why the low intelligence of mankind continues to be unable to improve. — Qiu Weimu

To bring human life closer to the main common ideals, and to provide the motivation and skills to achieve these ideals, is the highest endeavor of education. — Xueerfu

### Sailing in the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What to Do

A Xing and He Zixing were ordered to go out to do detective work, but A Xing came back first. Although it was a cold day, his short hair was steaming with heat. Wei Cheng busyly asked, "Did you see Miss Cui Zhen at Fei Changhe's house?" A Xing said, "There is no one at Fei Changhe's house. The doors and windows are tightly closed." Wei Cheng said unhappily, "You saw that his house was closed, so you came back?" A Xing said, "No. I asked a few of Fei Changhe's neighbors, and they all shook their heads and said they didn't know. There was one person who was about the same age as me. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but was stopped by a person next to him, who said, 'You eat your own food, take care of other people's affairs, you're so idle.' I pretended to leave, and later the person who wanted to speak followed me. I knew that his name was A De. I said good things to him, saying, 'Brother A De, there is no one at Fei Changhe's house. Could it be that a relative is having a wedding, and they all went to eat wedding wine?' A De pouted and said, 'Almost.' I estimated that A De must know something, and gave him a few more 'Brother A De's. A De finally came out and said, 'If you want to find Fei Changhe, Fei Changhe is such a tall and big person, not a needle, you can't hide it. I'll tell you, but don't tell anyone. Fei Changhe's family of four men and women are all at Wei Yunqing's house.'"

Wei Cheng was beyond his expectations and couldn't help but be surprised and said, "Ah! They are all at Wei Yunqing's house. What are they doing?" A Xing said, "A De doesn't know, he can't tell me, I don't know, let alone tell the young master." Wei Cheng said, "There are only three people in Fei Changhe's family, he himself, his wife, and his daughter, how can there be four people?" A Xing said, "Eh! The young master's brain is the same as mine. The young master thought about asking me, and I also thought about asking A De. A De thought for a while and said, 'They seem to have a niece, too.'" Wei Cheng jumped up and said, "Bi Cui Zhen was taken away by Fei Changhe's bastard, and he is hiding in Wei Yunqing's house. I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid of what Wei Yunqing Wei Yuqing." Wei Cheng said as he ran out, just as He Zixing came back. (165)
