### German Troops Penetrate Deep into Northern Suburbs of Stalingrad, Threatening the Tailek District on the East Bank of the Volga; Soviet Counter-Offensive Repulsed

Istanbul, 19th – Reuter

According to a broadcast from Radio Moscow, the decisive battle for Stalingrad has now begun. Although German forces have not yet achieved a decisive victory, the situation for Soviet troops is worsening. German aircraft are repeatedly bombing Soviet positions and, utilizing their numerical superiority, are specifically dispatching squadrons solely to bomb anti-aircraft artillery. Radio Moscow went on to say that German troops have entered the northern industrial district of the city, deploying various units in a concentrated offensive. Moscow has already admitted that the transportation of supplies to Soviet forces across the Volga River is under threat. After occupying the northern industrial district, German forces have consolidated their positions in Stalingrad. The increased pressure exerted by German forces on the Volga River front is particularly noteworthy. Soviet troops are fiercely resisting with their backs to the river, while German forces are constantly receiving reinforcements in the form of tanks, infantry, and aircraft. German bombardment of the riverbank is making it difficult for Soviet units and supplies to cross the Volga. Heavy fighting continues in the area of ​​Grozny-Mozdok, with German forces launching concentrated attacks with tanks and infantry. German forces continue to advance toward the Black Sea port of Tuapse. The German-Romanian forces have reinforced troops in western Caucasus for an offensive on Tuapse.

According to the Soviet Information Bureau's midnight communiqué, on the 18th of this month, Soviet troops continued to engage German forces in the Stalingrad area and Mozdok. There was nothing of note on other fronts.

Berlin, 18th – Havas

German military experts commented that the Eastern Front saw little progress yesterday due to weather conditions: (1) On the central and northern sectors, German aircraft were rarely active, only flying to the Toropets area to bomb railways and roads. The Red Army in that area is preparing an offensive, transporting troops and supplies to the Valdai Hills. A train passing through one village was also directly hit by our aircraft with several bombs, resulting in several direct hits. In addition, motorized units carrying fuel and ammunition were dispersed and several exploded and burned. (2) The weather was clear on the Stalingrad front. Yesterday, a German division seized a Red Army fortress factory ruin, an excellent position for future advances. (3) Two Red Army companies north of the Traktorzavod factory are surrounded. The first company has been annihilated, and the second is attempting to resist on the banks of the Volga River, currently under constant bombardment by our aircraft. (4) German heavy artillery has been transported to new positions, allowing our forces to control the eastern bank of the central Volga River. German forces are now making every effort to prevent enemy traffic on the river, but the Red Army is attempting to use artificial fog to conceal ships transporting food and ammunition to northern Stalingrad. (5) Over the past few days, the Red Army's offensive between the Don and Volga rivers north of Stalingrad, at the Dubovka bulge, has slowed. Yesterday, there was only reconnaissance activity. (6) There was nothing of note on the Caucasus front. The Red Army's counter-offensive in the Tailek district was repulsed by our forces, suffering heavy losses. (7) The weather was poor on the far northern Lappland and Finnish fronts, and combat operations were largely suspended.

Berlin, 19th – Reuter

The "Sunday Report" today carries an account of a German artillery unit participating in the Battle of Stalingrad, which fired a total of 62,000 rounds of ammunition in four weeks. During the same period, German forces fired 10,000 shells, destroying a total of 144 Soviet artillery pieces.

Each German soldier will receive extra uniforms such as leather vests, leather gloves, warm hats, underwear, and overcoats, as well as two extra blankets. The troops on the Finnish front received winter equipment last year and do not need additional supplies this year. German forces on the Eastern Front have also received a large amount of materials for building barracks, and coal has also been shipped to the Eastern Front. Ski equipment has also been provided. German aircraft also have special equipment.

Berlin, 19th – Reuter

The German High Command last night released details of the capture of the "Red Barricades" artillery factory in Stalingrad, stating that German forces continued to advance north after capturing the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory, annihilating the encircled Soviet troops in Spartakovka. At the same time, German infantry and tank units attacked the remaining defenders of the artillery factory. German forces advanced step by step, engaging the Soviet troops in hand-to-hand combat before completely occupying the factory. Now, within a radius of several kilometers of the factory, there is no trace of the enemy except for ruined walls and remnants. The German Air Force assisted ground troops in the operation. During the fierce fighting, German aircraft bombed enemy artillery positions on the east bank of the Volga River and on the island of Volzhsky. Many Soviet artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns were hit and destroyed. German fighter planes intercepted Soviet aircraft, preventing them from providing cover for the ground defenders. German aircraft completely controlled the skies over Stalingrad, shooting down sixteen Soviet aircraft with no German losses.

Berlin, 19th – Havas

The German High Command announced today that German forces have captured another hilltop in the Caucasus. In front of Stalingrad, enemy remnants have been cleared from the streets and industrial areas captured in recent days.

### Reorganization of Military Structure, Lineup of the Military Affairs Commission

Nanjing, 19th – Central News Agency

In order to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War, establish a wartime system, implement the reorganization of the military structure, and strengthen the lineup of the Military Affairs Commission to enter a watershed development period, the National Government has announced the following lineup of the reorganized Military Affairs Commission, with some partial changes to be made later: Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission: Wang Jingwei; Chief of General Staff: Liu Yufen; Vice Ministers: Army: Huang Ziqiang, Navy: Xu Jianting; Director of the General Affairs Office: Huang Ziqiang (concurrent), Deputy Director: Ma Dengzhou; Minister of the Army: Qian Dajun; Vice Minister: Zheng Dazhang; Minister of the Navy: Ren Yuandao; Vice Minister: Lu Fuchou; Director of the Aviation Department: Yao Xijiu; Director-General of the Logistics Directorate: Ye Peng; Chief of Staff: Fu Shuangying; Director of the Investigation and Statistics Department: Li Shiqun; Political Vice Minister: Yang Jie; Permanent Vice Minister: Xia Zhongming; President of the Military Council; Lu Duxuan; Military Attaché of the Military Attaché Office; Hao Pengju; Deputy Military Attaché: Su YinSen.

Matsui's Remarks

Nanjing, 19th – Central News Agency

Since taking office, Military Affairs Commission Senior Advisor Matsui has made many plans for the National Government's agricultural and military work. On the 19th, he met with reporters to express his views on the National Government's adjustment of the military structure and issued the following remarks: The National Government, based on the needs of the Greater East Asia War, implemented a fundamental adjustment of the military structure and established the wartime system of the National Army. Various regulations regarding this matter were also passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 13th, and various preparations were continued. All necessary procedures were completed on the 19th and officially announced. The structure of the Military Affairs Commission after this reform includes the Military Council, the Chief of General Staff, the General Affairs Office as the administrative office, and the Army Department, Navy Department, Aviation Department, Logistics Directorate, Army Training Directorate, and Investigation and Statistics Department, which were transferred from the Executive Yuan, a total of eight agencies under the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. It also includes the newly established Military Affairs Commission Military Attaché Office, Front Armies, Divisions, Headquarters, Pacification Headquarters, Capital Garrison Headquarters, and other central military academy educational supervision agencies such as the Central Military Academy, Political Training Class, Central Army General School Training Regiment, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force Ordnance Repair Depot. The focus of this adjustment is to strengthen the leadership of the central organs in order to distinguish them from the new organs mentioned above, with the goal of unifying command and actively increasing their independence. Therefore: (1) The Chief of General Staff, as the chief of staff of the Chairman, assists in unifying and strengthening the command of the Chairman, thereby increasing the authority of the central government over all military organs. (2) By eliminating the drawbacks of concurrent positions and adopting a system of "one person, one position," and by assigning appropriate talents to appropriate positions, the ability to improve work is greatly enhanced. (3) The new Military Attaché Office accommodates surplus and returning military attachés to meet future and temporary needs. (4) Strengthening the internal organization by adopting an elite approach can save personnel costs and improve treatment. (5) The full power of personnel appointment belongs to the Chairman, which can avoid the drawbacks of petitioning and intercession. This is its characteristic. Furthermore, the powers and missions of the key organs of the Military Affairs Commission are as follows: The Chief of General Staff is responsible for the guidance, coordination, and overall management of the various departments. As an agency that has long assisted the Chairman, the Chairman may not delegate the command or handle important matters to anyone else in his stead in the event of an accident. All matters must be decided by the Chairman, and when the various departments have important suggestions for the Chairman, they must first obtain the consent of the Chief of General Staff. Two Vice Ministers are appointed under the Chief of General Staff, one Major General each from the Army and Navy. The Army Vice Minister handles the guidance and coordination of matters related to the Army and Aviation, assisting the Chief of General Staff. The Navy Vice Minister does the same. The General Affairs Office, headed by the Army Vice Minister, who is also in charge of the staffing of the office to ensure close liaison with the various government departments, is responsible for the budget for Military Affairs Commission meetings, important formations, equipment, and personnel administration. The Chief of the Logistics Directorate bears joint responsibility for the budget composition and use with the Director General. The Army Training Directorate, which reports directly to the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, oversees the implementation of the various units, engages in the drafting and establishment of the original plan, and establishes the construction of the military base. This is the most important point in this adjustment of the military structure.

### Soviet Disappointment with Britain and the United States

London, 18th – Havas

According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the Soviet people are now encountering a serious crisis because the Soviet Union has already endured significant sacrifices. At this critical juncture, Britain is standing by, silent. This is the first disappointment. President Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, once strongly advocated the need to open a second front immediately. At that time, the Soviet people had great hopes for this, but the facts show that the Allied nations have not taken any practical actions. This is the second disappointment. In short, although the Soviet side still hopes that Ambassador Willkie can influence the military authorities of Britain and the United States, they ultimately feel that the Allied countries not only lack confidence in victory but also fail to demonstrate a spirit of unity.

### Many Army Officers Promoted

### Japan Concentrates Powerful Forces in the Solomon Islands; U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal Island Surrounded

Bern, 19th – Reuter

Geneva, "Swiss Daily" London correspondent reports that the British and Americans are not excited about the recent battles in the Solomon Islands. This is very inconsistent with the optimistic remarks recently released by the British and Americans. The people of London are anxious that the American army will not be able to prevent Japanese forces from landing on Guadalcanal Island. Japanese pressure on the U.S. Marines surrounded on the island has increased.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th – Reuter

Swedish newspapers carry news from London that Australia is very worried about not being able to obtain more detailed news about the Solomon Islands battles from the United States. Japan has concentrated powerful naval, land, and air forces in the area. Whether the U.S. can maintain its position depends on whether reinforcements can arrive in time. If Japan can gain superiority in the Solomon Islands, the entire Pacific situation will be affected. The silence from the American side indicates that the situation is not in their favor.

### Inhumane Treatment of Captured U.S. Pilots; Japanese to Execute Them; Already Decided by Military Court

Tokyo, 19th – Allied News Agency

On April 18th of this year, U.S. aircraft raided Japan, deliberately targeting non-military facilities such as hospitals and schools, indiscriminately dropping bombs and incendiary bombs, displaying cruel and inhumane behavior. The Japanese people are filled with indignation. The Japanese Army authorities have handed over the captured American pilots to a military court for trial. They directly admitted that such barbaric behavior was a matter of course. The Japanese side believes that such barbaric behavior cannot be tolerated and has decided to execute them. It has also been decided that anyone who commits barbaric acts in the future by raiding Japanese territory, Manchukuo, or Japanese military operational areas will be handed over to a military court and sentenced to death or severely punished without leniency. Regarding this matter, a statement was specifically issued on the 19th by the Chief of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, and a notice was issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Headquarters. The statement by the Chief of the Army Press Department of the General Headquarters stated that as a result of deliberations on the American pilots captured during the American air raid on Japanese territory on April 18th of this year, those who displayed inhumane behavior will be severely punished according to military law. The notice issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Headquarters stated that the enemy pilots captured during the recent American air raid on the territory of the Great Japanese Empire, who displayed inhumane behavior, have been sentenced to death or severely punished by military court decision.

The Axis forces have also repeatedly bombed Malta Island to block Allied sea transportation. The war clouds in North Africa are now becoming increasingly dense.

### Perpetrators of Assassination Attempt on Papen About to Be Retried

Istanbul, Turkey, 18th – Havas

The main culprits in the assassination attempt against the German Ambassador Papen, the Russian Pavioloff and Koniloff, were previously sentenced to twenty years in prison by the Istanbul Criminal Court. Several accomplices were also sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to ten years. Subsequently, the defendants refused to accept the appeal. According to the appellate court, it has revoked this judgment. The reason given in the written judgment is that the criminal court procedure was inadequate and the case files have been returned to the prosecutor, etc. The case will soon be heard again by the criminal court to decide whether to uphold the arbitration of the appellate court. The Ambassador Papen and his wife were attacked in February of this year and escaped unharmed. The assassin carried a bomb and was killed on the spot.

### German Propaganda Minister's Speech Claims Germany is Fighting for the Right to Exist; The Nation's Survival Depends on This Battle

Munich, 18th (Havas News Agency)

German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently delivered a speech here, stating, "We are now fighting for a matter of life and death. The rise and fall of the nation depends on this battle, truly a great era in our history. If we are defeated, the nation will lose its existence. Our enemies have openly declared that they will bind our country with another Treaty of Versailles. This time, we are not fighting for emperors and religions, but for the right to our existence and to improve the living standards of our people. This is not purely for ideals. In the past, our country fought for false desires, but this time the issue is significant and vastly different from the past, and our chances of victory are also unprecedented. We are now fighting for coal, iron, and especially the wheat that everyone needs. When the enemy claims that our army cannot advance further, the land our army has occupied on the Eastern Front is equal to the combined area of Germany, France, and England. Moreover, we are not only occupying it but also developing it for our use. The success our army has achieved in recent months is sufficient to prove its strength. This general offensive is not only to gain military superiority but also to meet our country's needs. In short, the Soviet army's resistance has been broken by us. The Dnipro and Don River basins are entirely under our control. Once Stalingrad falls, the Volga River will be ours, and our offensive against the Caucasus will be completed in time. If so, the richest oil-producing country in Europe will be ours. A country with the world's strongest army, coupled with the natural resources of oil, iron, coal, and wheat, will undoubtedly be victorious. As for the British saying that our army is now on the defensive, it is truly the height of foolishness. What we eat must be digested, but our digestive power has not been exhausted. We will gradually complete our planned objectives on the Eastern Front, and the first step is to destroy the Bolshevik threat to us. Regarding the British bombing of Germany, I can tell you that Britain has been bombing our western civilians since January 1940. Although we warned them that such indiscriminate bombing would only provoke retaliation, the British turned a deaf ear and continued to prepare for aggression, determined to undermine our morale. This bombing is still ongoing, but we know that the people have the strength to withstand this blow. Some may ask why we do not bomb Britain in a timely manner to retaliate. I can answer that most of our bombers have been concentrated near Stalingrad and the Caucasus front, where the fighting is urgent and requires many aircraft. What is even more noteworthy is that, under the current circumstances, conducting operations in the Caucasus and Egypt is far more important than diverting forces to Britain. It is only by knowing how to concentrate forces in important theaters of war that victory can be achieved. Fortunately, our people remain calm under enemy air raids, which is commendable. Even those who complain are mostly impatient people, and I do not condemn them. In general, our situation has changed, the supply situation has greatly improved, and Eastern European territories are being organized to develop production. If the British think we are unable to launch an offensive against them, we can leave it aside for now. When the time comes, we will respond. We are not warmongers and cannot solve the war and all its consequences, but the poor are now becoming rich, and the rich are becoming poor. We have every reason to be satisfied with the past war situation. We control Europe, and Europe, under the leadership of the Axis powers, can be self-sufficient. We can supply our people with everything they need and even improve our living standards. Everyone here today should know that Munich is the cradle of the National Socialist movement, and everyone should demonstrate the inherent sacrifice and patriotism of the Germanic nation."

### United Nations Envoys Flock to England to Discuss the Opening of a Second Front

Zurich, 19th (Central News Agency)

Following the stationing of approximately one American division in the Republic of Liberia, global attention has focused on Africa, considering the battle opportunities have been warming up. Additionally, South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts's recent trip to England for secret consultations with Churchill and key members of the British government, along with his address to both houses of the British Parliament, clarifying his views, and the US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau's flight to England representing the US government, all demonstrate that the United Nations is urgently seeking to agree on countermeasures regarding the so-called "Second Front" issue. The fact that both houses of the British Parliament jointly attended a speech by a foreign politician only occurred once before, when French President Lebrun visited England in March 1939, making this only the second time. There are varying perspectives on Smuts's mission, with speculations suggesting he will be appointed as the Supreme Commander of the United Nations forces or that he is traveling to England to discuss post-war reconstruction of politics and the economy. However, realistically, the current stage is still focused on strategic concerns, making discussions about post-war issues premature. Therefore, it is most likely that Smuts's main purpose in visiting England is to exchange strategic views, centered on the African continent. It is widely believed that the United Nations' plan to land in Western Europe for combat operations has been abandoned. Given the current situation, it is likely that Britain and the United States will attack French West African territories or North Africa to open a second front. The reasons why the United Nations must launch new operations in Africa are nothing more than the following: (1) to first establish a second front to somewhat satisfy Soviet demands; (2) to launch a war of a larger scale than the Madagascar operation with less sacrifice to stabilize domestic public opinion; (3) to provide further guidance to countries in South America, especially Brazil, which is close to Madagascar; (4) if the United Nations attacks French territories, diplomatic relations between France and the United States will inevitably be severed. Currently, France is already greatly troubled by complex political situations such as sending laborers to Germany, so it will inevitably be plunged into a more desperate situation. South Africa has agreed with Britain and the United States that if South Africa participates in the war, its military will only participate in operations in Africa. Therefore, Smuts's visit to England is closely related to the launching of a war centered on Africa. At the same time, the Axis air force's large-scale bombing of Malta also contains the function of countering such attempts by the United Nations. It is reported that the French have ordered the evacuation of women and children from Madagascar in preparation for any eventuality.

### Earthquake in the Alps

Paris, 19th (Havas News Agency)

An earthquake occurred in the La Condamine area of the Lower Alps province of France at 6:24 PM yesterday, lasting for several seconds. A rumbling sound was heard underground at the time.

### A Complete View of Dakar, the Capital of French West Africa (Part Two)

Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper

The French army in West Africa has an army corps, with the general command stationed in Dakar. The first division is stationed in Senegal, the second division in French Sudan and Upper Volta, and the third division in the remaining provinces. The remaining motorcycle units, engineering units, and artillery units are mostly stationed in Dakar. A military academy and a training school for ambulance personnel are also located in Dakar. The air force has two squadrons stationed in Bamako, French Sudan, which is close to Dakar, where an airport has also been built.

Commercially, Dakar has developed into a major commercial port because it has a good harbor and is the terminus of the Dakar-Saint-Louis railway. The land along the railway is very fertile, and the locals are civilized and cultivate peanuts, which yield a good harvest every year. Because the port of Saint-Louis cannot accommodate large ships, the export of peanuts and the import of foreign products all use Dakar as the port of entry and exit. Therefore, many ships enter and leave Dakar every year. In terms of tonnage alone, Dakar is the eighth largest commercial port in France.

Climate, Population, and Products

The land of French West Africa can be divided into three types: forests, grasslands, and deserts. The southern part of French Guinea is covered with towering trees and vast forests that stretch for dozens of miles, obscuring the sky. The area of French Sudan is grassland, becoming higher in altitude, eventually reaching the Sahara Desert. The Ivory Coast and Dahomey can be classified into the forest zone, while Upper Volta and Niger can be classified into the grassland zone. Mauritania is half beach and half desert. Only Senegal is blessed with both high mountains and plains and rivers. The area south of Dakar to the coast of Gambia is a large ocean area formed by the alluvial deposits of the Atlantic tide, and ships cannot enter from here. This piece of land is actually a sandy beach planted with trees, especially rubber trees.

The climate of French West Africa is also divided into three types according to the land: the forest zone is humid and sultry year-round; the grassland is rainy, but the part close to the desert is dry; the desert zone has no moisture year-round, and the temperature difference between day and night reaches extremes. The average annual temperature in the Dakar area is 23 degrees Celsius. The climate can be divided into two seasons each year: the dry season and the wet season. The arrival of the lark signals the beginning of the dry season (around next month), which lasts until the end of May. During the dry season, the daytime temperature is very high and extremely dry, while the nights are suddenly cool, with a large temperature difference between day and night. Carelessness can lead to illness.

The wet season begins in June and lasts until the end of September. During this period, the weather is hot and humid, often with violent and deceptive winds accompanied by rain.

Senegal's main product is peanuts. The soil in the Dakar area is soft, the weather is suitable, and the population is dense, so a large amount of peanuts can be produced every year. Other products include gum arabic, wax, coconut oil, kapok, bamboo, and indigo. Because of the grasslands, animal husbandry is also well-developed, with large numbers of water buffalo, goats, sheep, camels, and horses.

In terms of population, French West Africa has a total population of 15 million. The most densely populated area is Dakar, with a total of 40,000 people, followed by Saint-Louis with more than 20,000. The locals are divided into several races based on skin color and physical features. The largest race is the Wolof, who live in the Dakar area and are good at business and practice Islam. Because of frequent contact with Europeans, many Wolof people are civilized and wear clothes. However, most Wolof people, like the locals of other races, are naked year-round, sometimes using cloth strips to cover their lower bodies. When travelers arrive in Dakar, they are greeted with brown and black flesh and the smell of muscle juice, milk, fat, women, and camels. The various smells attack together, making it difficult to breathe. Standing on the wide pier of Dakar at night, the sky is full of stars, and the large lighthouse on Mamelles Hill shines, illuminating the Atlantic Ocean. The hot wind from the desert carries the humming of drums and monotonous songs of the locals, making people feel that Africa is truly a mysterious land. (The End)

Abundant Products of Dakar

Peanuts are abundant in Dakar. The picture shows the situation of bagging and waiting for transportation. The fortifications are stacked with non-sandbags. Each bag of peanuts only sells for five cents, which can be said to be cheap and of good quality.

### Anti-Pickpocketing Efforts Prove Effective

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reports that since the Municipal Council Police Department actively implemented anti-pickpocketing measures, an average of about twenty to thirty arrests have been made each day. The police are also questioning suspected criminals and advising loiterers not to linger on the streets. According to a senior police officer, since the anti-pickpocketing campaign was launched on October 6, petty theft cases have decreased, and robberies that were previously beyond the reach of the law have also been solved due to this campaign. It is said that many pickpockets have been arrested. Plainclothes detectives from the Xinzha Police Station have arrested 100 thieves in the past seven days. Movie theaters, restaurants, and major department stores have also posted signs reminding the public to be vigilant against pickpockets, and the promotional posters on the public concession trams have also been replaced, as the Shanghai Tram Company originally planned to replace the promotional posters at least three times during the anti-pickpocketing campaign.

The association's drawn plate prices for coarse sand sugar stock were 300 yuan, and for red sand sugar stock 297 yuan, fluctuating by only 1-2 yuan. A total of about 1,000 bags were traded.

Changping Peach New Supply

This year's walnut harvest is poor, so the source is not much, and the price is getting tighter. The first batch of new Changping peaches recently arrived and opened at 150 yuan per 100 catties. The price of cold-air hand-picked peaches once opened at 700 yuan, which shows that the market price is still tightening.

Tapioca Flour Gradually Increases

More is imported than exported, and the market is frequently tight. For example, the top Flying Qilin brand was less than 800 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday's market price exceeded 800 yuan, reaching 850 yuan. The trend is likely to rise again.

Taiwan Branches Rise Again

Recent sales have been revitalized, with the Northern gang taking more, and the medicine gang also making purchases. Therefore, ordinary goods have also risen by 20-30 jiao per pound. Due to the small amount of labeled goods released, the market is expected to continue to tighten.

Bean Cakes Sold as Soon as They Arrive

Bean deliveries are still sporadic, and the market continues to be firm. Twenty bags of Chongming Sha Chi were priced at 173 yuan. Ten or so bags of Wujiang Jianqing were priced at 221 yuan. Bean cakes are sold as soon as they arrive, and due to the capital side's absorption, the market is quite strong. Yesterday, the Kaiyuan Long bean cake price was 67 yuan to 68.5 yuan for three carts. The Fei Zi bean cake price was 628.2 yuan for one cart. The Lu Zi five hundred piece price was 67.5 yuan.

British American Tobacco Remarkably Firm

Cigarettes of British and American goods continue to fly high due to persistent pulling from hoarding households. The national cigarettes tend to flourish. The Japanese cigarette market is firm and stable. The Great Britain brand is 9,000 yuan, the Old Knife brand is 7,700 yuan, the Fairy brand is 6,700 yuan, the Five China brand is 6,700 yuan. Which is a fierce increase of 2-300 yuan compared to the weekend. The Pinchai brand is also up 50 yuan at 7,250 yuan. The national cigarettes, Pyramid brand is 5,400 yuan, Beautiful brand is 4,750 yuan, Golden Mouse brand is 3,300 yuan, and Bai Duoduo dragon three are each up 200 yuan. Golden Dragon 3,000 yuan, are each up 50 yuan. The Japanese cigarette, Golden Gun brand is 3,200 yuan, the Golden Building brand is 3,400 yuan, Red Rose is 2,620 yuan, Quanlu brand is 3,400 yuan, Nianzhi pack is 3,000 yuan, Double Axe brand is 3,400 yuan, Guide brand is 2,900 yuan. The market state can be said to be firm.

Steel Plate Sales Difficult to Expand

Steel plates from 2.5 li and above, up to one fen or more in thickness and pattern, have been sluggish for a long time. The reason is that the local inventory is insufficient, and shipyards, ironworks, etc. have no intention to purchase. The number of retail buyers is small, and the trend is difficult to develop. The current market price is 20,000 yuan per ton for patterns from 2.5 li to 7.5 li, and 18,000 yuan per ton for patterns one fen to thick (because there are no thick patterns on the market, the quoted price is lower than thin patterns).

Woolen Fabrics Difficult to Raise or Lower

There are no big ups and downs in woolen fabrics. The market prices of all goods have become difficult to raise, resulting in few transactions. The old number one overcoat woolen fabric from Gongda is still wholesaled at 225 yuan per yard, the new one at 190 yuan, Meifeng at 350 yuan, Ewo riding breeches at 220 yuan, indoor Fengyouzi Toskin at 250 yuan, wuzhi at 200 yuan, grass green and navy blue gabardine at 180 yuan, 707 flat thick serge at 200 yuan, 55 medium thick serge at 205 yuan.

### A Word from College Graduates Who Don't Lose Their Jobs and Open Small Shops

— Ping

Picture: Graduates don't lose their jobs. This is the conclusion I reached after visiting a newly opened department store consignment shop and talking with several college students who opened this small shop.

It was an afternoon with the autumn sun setting in the west when a reporter stepped into a small shop opened by college students, located across from the Association Générale des Étudiants de France on Jing'an Temple Road.

After taking a whirlwind tour of the department store consignment shop, from daily necessities to clothing, calligraphy, painting, embroidery, and handicrafts, I sat down and began chatting with several people in charge. It was as if we had started a forum on the issues of graduation and unemployment, with you and I going back and forth.

Naturally, my question was to find out their business methods. So, I began by asking how they calculated their profits from the items consigned to them for sale.

"Our calculation method is roughly based on a 10% commission. The more we sell, the less the commission," a younger associate explained to me after handing me a printed document.

"Isn't this a good opportunity for hoarders to release their goods?" I asked the seller, turning to another gentleman who seemed like a professor who once taught with chalk.

"Yes, some goods are indeed consigned by households, but in addition to getting our commission, our selling price is cheaper than the market price. I don't think this is rewarding hoarding at all. On the contrary, it's a great deal for consumers," the professor-like gentleman said, taking off his glasses. He paused here.

"Actually, our biggest goal is to directly connect with producers so that consumers can get what they want through our mediation, and at a reasonable price. For example, the wool embroidery here is a perfect example," explained a young man wearing a very neat suit. He pointed to the wool-embroidered sofa I was sitting on and continued, "Before 12.8, these kinds of things were exclusively exported to foreign countries. Now, we have contacted the factory to bring them together with our customers, not only to promote these products to the market, but also because it's a home craft worth promoting."

I could tell that he was about to launch into a long speech, so I interrupted him impolitely and said,

"You guys are really good at using your brains."

"Yes, to be honest, people with a college education should use their brains to open this kind of new small shop," said another bookish gentleman.

"But isn't this a waste of talent?" I felt that the atmosphere of the conversation was too serious, so I inserted this sentence. To my surprise, several of them debated this question extensively.

"I think that in China, there are many places where tasks outnumber people, not people outnumbering tasks."

"College students only want to sit in government offices and collect a monthly salary after graduating. They don't want to do things that other people are unwilling to do, or businesses that their families don't have."

"Educated people only know how to enjoy material things, but they don't know how to use their own strength to create material things for others to enjoy."

"College students standing behind the counter should be a spirit worth promoting. We hope that all shop assistants will be college graduates in order to develop Chinese commerce."

"We definitely don't want to steal other people's jobs. We hope to set an example and raise the standards of those engaged in commerce."

With one sentence after another, we ended up discussing the issues of unemployment and graduation. It was as if the reporter was participating in a lively forum, so I simply listened silently to their conclusions. They were five gentlemen in total, and they all gave an absolute definition of "graduation is unemployment."

If a customer hadn't wanted to buy some laundry detergent, our conversation would have continued.

After leaving this new type of commercial company, I felt like I was leaving Tan Hall when I was young, with the words "graduating without unemployment, college students have a path" still ringing in my ears.

### Fire in Garage

A fire broke out in the garage of a German resident's house at No. 15, Lane 30, Yidingpan Road, West Shanghai, at 6:10 last night. A car was burned in the fire. The fire brigade dispatched vehicles to the scene and extinguished the fire in about half an hour. The house was slightly damaged.

Yesterday's newspaper dispatch time was 6:20.

Spring and Autumn

### A Rooster's Crow Brings Light to the World

— Bow

The rooster loves the daytime. There's the ancient saying, "A rooster's crow brings light to the world." I also remember a passage from elementary school Chinese class describing a rooster, saying, "When the sun is about to rise, cock-a-doodle-doo. When the sun is high in the sky, cock-a-doodle-doo."  This shows that a rooster's crow tells of the coming dawn and awakens people from their sweet dreams.

The rooster is also punctual. When dawn hasn't arrived and people haven't had enough sleep, it absolutely won't utter a sound. If it crows when people are still half-asleep and drowsy, and the sky is still pitch black, then people will surely resent it. If a rooster changes its habits and goes "cock-a-doodle-doo" as the sun sets, or "cock-a-doodle-doo" in the middle of the night, then it's no longer a rooster but something like a rat, and its voice will change from loud and clear to something stuttering, like "squeak, squeak."  A rooster would never do that.

The rooster only silently endures the long, warm nights, preparing itself and quietly waiting and watching. So when it doesn't crow, it doesn't, but when it crows, the sky will surely brighten and people will surely awaken. This is the rooster's greatness, and that's why it's the only one fit for the position of heralding the dawn.

### To the Hongying Library

— Yongji

On the 17th of this month, I saw a special article in the Shen Bao about the opening of the Hongying Library. So on Saturday afternoon, I took advantage of some free time to visit it. The Hongying Library is the former Cultural Library. Its location is at 1413 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, in a Western-style house. There's no sign at the entrance, nor any special marking, and the door is closed tightly. People who are new to it or unaware of it will really have trouble finding it. Even if they find the house number, they can only wander around at the entrance, thinking it's someone's mansion. There's a doorbell on the left side of the gate. Feel free to ring it. After a while, a young man in student attire will open the door with a friendly attitude and welcome you in, then immediately slam the door shut.

There are only two staff members inside. The librarian is an old gentleman named Zhang, and there's also the young man in student attire, Mr. Xie. Besides them, there's a gatekeeper. There's a fee for reading, calculated as 40 yuan for the whole year, 20 yuan for half a year, and 8 yuan for four months. Joining now only costs half the price. Temporary tickets can only be used on the day of purchase and cost 50 cents each.

The reading room is a Western-style hall. It's not very big, only able to accommodate about a dozen people. The four walls are lined with bookshelves and cabinets. Further inside is a storage room for books, with a little space left over for the office and the librarian's resting place. In front of the house is a small garden planted with some vegetables. There are many flower pots placed there. To the right of the garden are many side rooms. If all the books were placed in the side rooms, the hall could accommodate many more people. If the garden were also used as a reading area, then the space would be very ample.

The placement and arrangement of books here is different from other libraries. It doesn't have numbers or a general catalog, only classified index cards arranged in cabinets. Here, the library has three types of catalogs: a catalog of books donated in the names of individuals, a catalog of books in the Hongying Library, and a catalog of newspapers and magazines. The books with the most material are those related to the history of China in the last hundred years. There are also many books that are out of print. The most notable thing is that the library has preserved newspapers from the late Qing Dynasty to the present, in all sorts of forms, which is quite interesting to explore. In addition, it has selected 455 kinds of magazines and supplements, extracted summaries, classified them, and compiled an index of over 102,000 items, which is truly remarkable and a great contribution to the academic community. There are not many English books. Books on social and natural sciences are also few. But for those who like Chinese studies and modern history, this place has excellent materials.

Finally, the reading hours here are from 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM, and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. It's closed all day on Mondays. I hope everyone will make good use of it.

### The Price Ceiling on Pork

— Xin

A week ago, the price of pork in the French Concession's market was 8.20 yuan per catty. But the general meat stalls were asking 13 yuan per catty, and some meat stalls were even closed without any pork for sale.

That morning, walking through the market, there were three meat stalls along the street where housewives and maids were buying pork. But for 3 or 4 yuan, they could only buy a sliver of wind-dried meat. Everyone was complaining about the high price.

Suddenly, a gentleman in a suit, carrying a briefcase, walked up to one of the meat stalls, took out 8.20 yuan, and pointed out that he wanted to buy a catty of leg meat. The stall owner said he wouldn't sell it for less than 13 yuan, and they began to argue.

"Doesn't the sign you hung say 8.20 yuan per catty? That's the price ceiling set by the Municipal Council. You know you'll be punished for exceeding the price."

"Sir, the purchase price is high, and I can't do business at a loss."

"If the purchase price is high, you can ask the guild to request the Municipal Council to lower the price ceiling. Otherwise, you can only sell it at the price ceiling. Is this sign the price ceiling notice? If you don't sell it, you should take down the price ceiling sign. Otherwise, I'll buy your meat at the price ceiling. If you don't sell it to me, I'll call the police."

"We're all Chinese. Why are you making trouble? We're just trying to earn a living. Please help us out."

"I'm not making trouble. I'm buying your meat according to the price ceiling. It's not much, just one catty. If you don't sell it, please tear down the price ceiling sign."

As they were arguing, a police officer, number XXX, walked by.

"Officer XXX, he's not selling according to the price ceiling. He wants to sell it for 13 yuan per catty. Please enforce the price ceiling."

The police officer thought for a moment and cleverly explained, "According to the rules, those who don't comply with the price ceiling will have their license revoked. It's easy for me to revoke his license, but the soaring pork prices are also a reality."

"Then let's go to the association together. Please maintain the price ceiling and revoke his license."

The police officer hesitated for a moment but finally ordered the stall owner to sell a catty of meat to the gentleman in the suit at the price ceiling.

The gentleman in the suit wrapped the meat in paper, put it in his briefcase, and left. The stall owner, with a mournful face, said to the people around, "Selling that catty of meat lost me four yuan."

The onlookers were saying that the gentleman in the suit was a troublemaker, that he often came to forcefully buy pork, and that the meat stalls exceeding the price ceiling seemed to be justified.

Yesterday, I walked past that meat stall again. The price ceiling sign had been replaced with a new one, now increased to 9.30 yuan per catty. I thought that it would finally be sold according to the price ceiling, adding that the Municipal Council was expressing its hope that citizens would not buy goods exceeding the price ceiling and that they could report any refusal to sell to the police station.

But when the maids were buying meat, they were still getting only a thin slice for 3 or 5 yuan. Anyone could see that it was more than 9.30 yuan per catty. Several maids asked the meat stall owner how much the meat was per catty.

"Don't ask the price. Just say how much you want to buy, and I'll cut that much for you. I won't let you suffer a loss." This was the meat stall owner's clever reply.  I wonder if the price ceiling on pork will ever be effective if things continue this way. It's still the result of meat eaters being too careless and unwilling to make trouble.

### Thoughts on Picking Broken Rice

— Yunzhi

Living in someone else's home, I have nothing to do in my spare time, so I help them pick broken rice. Picking broken rice is naturally not difficult, but it's also not very easy. It requires perseverance, patience, and also carefulness. Just one moment of carelessness and insects and stones will have already slipped through your fingers. And if you get bored picking and feel like giving up, then half a liter of broken rice in ten days will have to be given away.

Broken rice is probably still a new friend to people in Shanghai, and before, they were probably afraid they had never even heard of it. I grew up in the countryside and already had a connection with it. I remember that at that time, a relative worked at a rice mill. I would always go to him every day to get one or two liters to use as feed for the few chickens raised at home. That broken rice was never picked, but it was at least "du mi" – the kind of "du mi" that people in Shanghai now envy. Moreover, I don't think it had so many stones. Aren't people more miserable than chickens?

The disposal of broken rice is often a problem for ordinary families. Upper-class families probably give it to their servants, while middle- and lower-class families have no choice but to eat it themselves. But broken rice is not only hard to cook but also difficult to cook well. Cooking rice with it makes it both mushy and undercooked. Making porridge with it is better, but you can't eat porridge all day long. Trying to take a middle ground by mixing it with whole rice and cooking it together results in even the whole rice being half-cooked. As a result, every family is constantly complaining.

But I think complaining is unnecessary. Unconditional satisfaction is a barrier to progress. We must hope and believe that there will definitely be a day when not only will broken rice return to the chicken feed trough, but we will all be able to eat enough white, fragrant "du mi" rice. Otherwise, we are useless.

### A Story About an Eyeache

— A'Hui

An eyeache is a minor ailment, but being forced to stop work because of an eyeache is what makes people feel the most miserable.

But recently, I saw another story about an eyeache.

One cloudy afternoon, I went to a friend's house to study. It happened that she had a girlfriend there chatting. After being introduced, I learned that this young lady had been studying at university last semester. She had temporarily stopped studying this half year because she felt her health was declining. Her attire was quite fashionable, but even more fashionable was that she was wearing sunglasses in this cool autumn weather.

"You're really modern, still wearing sunglasses these days," my friend joked.

"No, my eyes are a bit uncomfortable," she said, adjusting her glasses.

"Oh, does your eye hurt? What caused it?" my friend asked with concern.

"I don't know. Um, is schoolwork busy at your school?" She changed the topic.

"Yes, it's very busy," I added, opening my textbook to signal that she could leave soon.

"That's because you take studying too seriously. You might as well make it more relaxed."

No one replied. Seeing our eager expressions to prepare for our studies, she also excused herself and left.

A few days passed. Yesterday, I went to this friend's house to study again. Just as I sat down, she also arrived. She was wearing new autumn clothes, and the sunglasses were gone, revealing a joyful light in her eyes.

"Oh, your eye is better!" my friend said happily.

"No," she said showing off. "Do you see anything different about my eyes?"

"No, no, nothing different," my friend replied naively.

"Look more closely," she said, widening her eyes and walking up to my friend.

"Oh, I see!" my friend exclaimed loudly. "You have double eyelids!"

She smiled contentedly.

"How is it? Do my eyes look bigger? Are they okay?" She stopped looking at me, who was absorbed in reading, and changed her tone. "Are you two studying hard again? Then I won't bother you."

With that, she hurried away. My friend, still looking at her, said, "Really pretty, really beautiful eyes."

Although I didn't participate in the conversation, I could hear more clearly from the side, see more clearly, and understand more thoroughly. This is how this young lady was suffering from an eyeache created in the twentieth century.

Now that her eyeache has been cured, the students at the university next year will be smitten by her artificially beautiful eyes.

### Sharing the Boat Through Storms

— Hejia Branch

(10) Flying Peak

Huanglong laughed, "Oh, so that's how he died." Mrs. Ye the Second said, "Who did you hear that from, Uncle?" Li Youxie said, "I heard it from someone who comes to our factory to mill rice. He didn't see it with his own eyes. I even said that these heroes only know how to deal with Wei Shaoyun, but they don't know how to deal with Wei Yunqing." As Li Youxie spoke, he looked around the room, stuck out his tongue, and added, "Wei Shaoyun is just a frivolous playboy, but Wei Yunqing is a great traitor and villain. What he does is evil and creates calamity. Wei Yunqing is much worse than Wei Shaoyun." Li Youxie then thought of something else and was anxious to leave, saying that he would come again for his mother's death anniversary and that Wei Cheng should visit him at his home. He also asked why Miss Cuizhen was not to be seen. He said that and didn't wait for anyone to answer before leaving. After Li Youxie left, Huanglong first chuckled and clenched his right fist, bringing it up to his face and looking at it. He laughed and said, "I didn't think that with just a punch that wasn't even at full strength, Wei Shaoyun would be so fragile and die. It's not right for Li Youxie's uncle to say there were three or four heroes. But saying that Wei Shaoyun died, I think, is definitely not wrong. I think it's better to be careful and close the big door." Huanglong and Cuizhen both went to the back part of the house.

Wei Cheng didn't object to Mrs. Ye the Second doing this because ladies are always more timid than others, and if you don't go along with her, she will become even more timid. Wei Cheng was also afraid that Huanglong's temper was straightforward. In other words, he was stubborn. He quickly pulled Huanglong and said, "Let's go to the back together. I'll drink with you. The weather seems even colder today than yesterday. Drinking is just what we need, no matter if we've eaten or not." Huanglong walked to the back and laughed, "Hearing them say that nobody knows who hit Wei Shaoyun, it's best to let me slowly walk over to Sheng Hushan's house with my hands tied behind my back, step by step, and see what kind of face Wei Shaoyun has after he died. If he had an arm or a leg to spare, I'd give him another punch after his death." Wei Cheng said, "Brother Long, you're joking again."
