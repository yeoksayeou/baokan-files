### Before Leaving China, Willkie Inspected the Yellow River Region; Narrowly Escaped Death in an Encounter with Japanese Aircraft

Lisbon, Tenth Day, Allied News Agency Telegram

Chongqing News: Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie has completed his visit to Chongqing. He flew away from China yesterday to return to the United States to report everything to the American President. Willkie did not return to Chongqing after visiting the front lines in North China, but took off from Chengdu Airport.

Lisbon, Tenth Day, Allied News Agency Telegram

News from Chongqing received here today: Willkie narrowly escaped death on Thursday when Japanese aircraft bombed troops near the railway line outside Luoyang. Willkie was inspecting the front lines in the Yellow River region and was accompanied by the eldest son of General Shi, Wei-guo. They encountered Japanese aircraft bombing and immediately took cover.

Buenos Aires, Tenth Day, Allied News Agency Telegram

Willkie's remarks during his visits to Moscow and Chongqing have drawn criticism from Washington and London. When President Roosevelt was asked about this by foreign reporters yesterday, he replied that Willkie had fulfilled his mission satisfactorily. He added that newspaper reports about Willkie's statements in the Soviet Union and China were purely speculative and had not been verified. However, political observers in Washington believe that a public rift between Willkie and President Roosevelt is inevitable upon Willkie's return to the United States.

### Britain and the United States Will Respond to Stalin, Explaining War Plans and Demanding the Opening of a Second Front; Allies' Emotions Are Urgent

Zurich, Tenth Day, Allied News Agency Telegram

The ripple effect caused by Stalin's blunt expressions in Washington and London has not yet subsided. The British House of Commons will issue a declaration on war policy, and US President Roosevelt will give a speech on the 13th of this month, perhaps also explaining the plan for the war and its results. There are already signs of this trend: ① Stalin's expressions prove that there are still shortcomings in the Allied strategy and that the common war goal needs to be clarified. ② President Roosevelt and Stimson advocate that the Allies should punish the culprits. ③ US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley, President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Zale, and Willkie will all return to report the truth about Moscow, Chongqing, London, and the Vatican. Regarding this matter, the London Times has published that if the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States can determine a common war policy, then the front lines of each country will inevitably be stronger. However, military policy cannot be separated from diplomatic policy, and the Atlantic Charter should be supplemented.

Stockholm, Sweden, Ninth Day, Central News Agency Telegram

According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda published an article on the 9th on the issue of the second front, stating that Napoleon's simultaneous operations on the eastern and western fronts marked a new era in European history. At that time, British Prime Minister Pitt did not send British troops to the continent, but only provided financial assistance to the Allied nations. After his death, Britain changed this erroneous tactic, forcing Napoleon to fight simultaneously in Russia and against Kutzov, and in Spain against Wellington. Therefore, to this day, all the nationals of the countries participating in the war should fulfill their responsibilities to each other to achieve a common goal.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, Ninth Day, Havas News Agency Telegram

Since yesterday, the Soviet Broadcasting Station has been broadcasting a song about the second front to Britain, called "Sharing Weal and Woe," because the domestic sentiment in the Soviet Union urging the Allied nations to immediately open a second front is high. Therefore, this song is deeply meaningful. Moscow newspapers have all written articles commenting on it. For example, the British newspaper "Moscow News" published today that it is essential that the Allied nations immediately devote all their efforts to attacking Germany. At present, in terms of military strength, Germany's enemies have the advantage. However, the final question will depend on how this advantage is used. We know that there are some people who do not want to see the war end quickly and do not believe that our strength is superior to Hitler's. There is also a part of the people who mistakenly believe that the time factor is favorable to our side. However, in order to defeat Hitler's Germany, all its enemy countries must have the necessary combined strength to quickly attack that country. In addition, the speeches made by President Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie and the written statements made by Stalin to American reporters on the 4th of this month are also the focus of comments in Soviet newspapers. Other newspapers strongly stated that this is the best time to land in Western Europe. The newspapers also pointed out that the people of Britain and the United States all support the immediate opening of a second front. The British Labor Party also recently resolved at its conference to demand that the government immediately open a second front. In addition, the Moscow radio broadcast a resolution passed by British workers at a meeting in London, saying that if the Soviet Union had not fought for the common good, Britain would have already been in a desperate situation.

### The Soviet Union Announces Abolition of Political Departments

Moscow, Tenth Day, Havas News Agency Telegram

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has ordered the abolition of the political departments of the Red Army in order to integrate the military and political affairs. This order was signed by the People's Commissar of Defense, Stalin, proving that the rumor that Stalin had resigned from his post was unfounded.

Moscow, Tenth Day, Havas News Agency Telegram

Regarding the abolition of the Red Army's political department, TASS has published news saying that the Red Army's political department has failed to make any progress in the army and has made it impossible to unify military and political affairs, so it has been abolished. The order issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet stipulates that the command of the Red Army should belong to one person, and the military and political work of each unit should be the responsibility of the military generals.

### Chongqing's Movements After the Greater East Asia War

— Chen Binhe

(1) The Situation on the Eve of the War

The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War changed the entire landscape of the international situation in the East. What policies did the Chongqing regime adopt after this war? At that time, the Chongqing regime was reveling in the all-powerful illusion of the ABCD line, believing that the mere propaganda of the ABCD line was enough to scare off Japan and come to Chongqing to discuss glorious peace. Therefore, it not only did not think about how to maintain international routes in case Japan broke through the BACD line, but all the serious issues that could determine the future destiny of Chongqing had never been planned or studied. On the contrary, they were arguing about the issues of official positions and wealth after the ABCD line propaganda victory and the achievement of glorious peace. The actual situation of the Chongqing regime on the eve of the Greater East Asia War was like this. In a word, it was a misjudgment. It was believed that relying solely on the ABCD line in words and newspapers could really completely block Japan and freeze all of Japan's operations. Therefore, they did not think that the Greater East Asia War would really happen, so they did not make any preparations.

(2) The Situation During the Shattered Dream Period

The Greater East Asia War finally broke out ruthlessly. The Greater East Asia War shocked the dignitaries of the Chongqing regime, who were sound asleep in the glory of peace, like a nightmare. However, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Chongqing regime, when it suddenly woke up from the shock and trance, was immediately bewitched by another fantasy and became absurdly frenzied, waiting for the victory of the Anglo-American Allied Forces. So it declared war on Japan and announced that Chongqing would fight side by side with Britain and the United States. Which of the dignitaries of the Chongqing regime was not filled with absurd joy and hope for the Anglo-American war against Japan? What will happen after returning to Nanjing? What will happen after returning to Shanghai? This almost became the main topic of ordinary officials and civil servants. Yes, the Chongqing regime did not expect at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War that British strategy would focus on dealing with Hitler, that the military preparations that Britain and the United States had spent heavily on in the Pacific for several years would actually become a paper tiger in name only, that Japan would still have the strength to win every battle in Southeast Asia, that Japan would not need to transfer a large number of troops from the Chinese battlefield, and that Japan would launch offensives on the Chinese battlefield while fighting against the British symptoms, and the constant offensives in the North China, South China, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi war zones would be staged. All illusions were finally shattered, and the actual difficulties and dangers seriously came to the Chongqing regime. The Burma Road was controlled by Japan, and Japan launched a large-scale offensive on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.

(3) Military Measures

What military measures did the Chongqing regime take after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War? First of all, in order to cooperate with the Anglo-American Far East military, when the Japanese army attacked Burma and went deep into the suppression of light, it began to send Luo Zhuoying's troops to Burma to help in the war. However, due to the following reasons, the troops entering Burma encountered major difficulties and losses: (1) Due to the lack of unity in the military command between Chongqing and Britain, it involuntarily became the rearguard for covering the retreat of the British army, that is, the troops prepared to be sacrificed. (2) Due to the British soldiers' lack of fighting spirit and the Burmese people's hatred for Britain, they failed to assist Britain in the war, which also greatly disadvantaged the Chongqing army. (3) The Chongqing army did not undergo sufficient preparation and deployment before entering Burma, and was hastily dispatched when it recognized my urgent need, so it had the following shortcomings: (1) In terms of action, due to the congestion of cargo transportation on the Jieju Burma Road and the constant Japanese bombing, and the Burmese railway was narrow-gauge and the number of soldiers carried by the train was small, the military action was slow. (2) In terms of equipment, the Chongqing army also had many shortcomings, and it failed to foresee the weather in Burma. Each soldier carried winter clothes and quilts, which greatly inconvenienced their actions and combat. (3) The Chongqing army not only did not understand the Burmese dialect, which caused misunderstandings with the locals and often suffered from loss of food, shelter, and getting lost, but also did not understand English, which caused estrangement between the Chongqing army and the British army and often caused misunderstandings. Except for those who were conscripted, most of the troops entering Burma are now cut off from their return routes and have gone to India to become isolated troops. Secondly, the friction between Chongqing and the Communist Party could not be completely resolved, but tended to become more serious. Therefore, the most elite troops of Chongqing, such as Hu Zongnan and Zhu Shaoliang, totaling about 300,000, were distributed in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin area. Again, the Chongqing direct line troops had to be distracted by preventing the Communist Party, and because of the lack of heavy weapons, they could not counterattack. They only dared to defend the territory and did not dare to attack. Because of this, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in May and June suffered a disastrous defeat.

(4) Political Measures

What political measures did the Chongqing regime take after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War? First of all, it convened the Ninth Plenary Session. Although there were some decisions on all aspects at that meeting, there were still no thorough and clear decisions on the most basic issues of unity, constitutional government, and economic foothold in the reply. It was still an empty and impractical way to deal with all changes with invariance. There were still no new ears and eyes in politics, and there were no signs of renewal with the people. It was not enough to cope with the drastic changes in the Liaodong situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. On the contrary, the Chongqing regime was still mixed with those shameless financial tycoons and bureaucrats who made a fortune from the national crisis, and still mixed with that group of politicians and party sticks who made a living from friction. Those gentlemen were either accused of having ulterior motives or falsely accused of being members of different parties, so that they had no place to live and felt bitter. Secondly, the unity between the Chongqing regime and the various parties has not improved. Especially at the beginning of Japan's declaration of war on Britain and the United States, the dignitaries of the Chongqing side believed that they could breathe a sigh of relief and prepared to settle old scores. Therefore, not only did the friction between Chongqing and the Communist Party not disappear and continue to develop, but the attitude towards the National Salvation Association, the Youth Party, the National Socialist Party, and the Third Party became more arrogant, more disobedient to the well-intentioned advice of people outside the party, and more attempted to exclude leaders from all parties outside the party. The most obvious manifestation is that the Third National Political Participation Council has undergone new changes. The so-called election of political participants was entirely handled by the Jiang Party. The number of places for the cultural circles and social leaders who accommodated the most talents from various parties in the past two sessions was reduced from 138 to 60. The only significance of the so-called National Political Participation Council as an organ of public opinion was also eliminated and became a complete organ of public opinion monopolized by the Jiang Party. As for the implementation of constitutional government and the convening of the National Assembly, etc., which had already been allowed to be realized, now they are not even mentioned, just like the independence proposed by Britain to India, becoming something that can be hoped for but not reached. Again, the sense of pride and the right to sleep were again announced on May 5 with the National General Mobilization Law. Originally, every country should have mobilized at the beginning of the war in order to win victory. However, the Chongqing regime has nominally fought for five years and only now thought of general mobilization. This is really a miracle. Moreover, to implement general mobilization, at least two points must be realized. First, it is necessary to make real national mobilization so that every common people is willing to participate in the mobilization instead of relying solely on the oppression of laws and regulations. Second, it is necessary to universally and thoroughly mobilize instead of partially and incompletely, and even with exceptions. However, does the National General Mobilization Law announced by the Chongqing regime now meet the above two standards? Here, we only need to see whether there are representatives of various parties and factions or leaders from all walks of life participating in the National General Mobilization Conference. We only need to see whether the manpower, material resources, financial resources, land, and cultural institutions of the magnates in the court and their affiliated persons have also complied with the General Mobilization Law. Our answer is absolutely no. In addition, in domestic affairs, we can also see the unsoundness of the central and local political institutions, see that there are still many useless people in the court, and that there are talents in all directions who have no reason.

(5) Diplomatic Measures

What was the Chongqing regime's most得意handwriting after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War? It was the acquisition of twenty-six allied nations. But what actual benefits did it get? Initially, the Chongqing regime declared its support for the Anglo-American war against Japan and declared war on the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy and their allies. However, these were completely out of passivity. What price did it actually get? The reason why the Chongqing regime did so was that it hoped that Britain and the United States would first solve Japan. For this request, the Chongqing regime mobilized all foreign affairs agencies and public opinion agencies to shout the slogan of solving Japan first. However, after only ten months, Britain and the United States have only retreated. Recently, they have publicly stated to the Chongqing regime that Britain and the United States are now concentrating their efforts to deal with Hitler. Therefore, the Pacific war situation still depends on Chongqing to take more responsibility and survive 1943 before talking about it. This greatly disappointed the dignitaries of the Chongqing regime because they had long since lost faith in themselves and only sought hope in Britain and the United States. After disappointment, they could no longer cheer up. Secondly, in order to deal with Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Chongqing regime advocated the Pacific Charter Movement. However, because Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were focusing their attention on Europe, this movement did not generate any response. Again, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing regime has begun to demand that the Soviet Union send troops to resist Japan. Under the slogan of solving Japan first, it has continuously tried to promote the Japanese-Soviet war. However, this diplomatic work has undoubtedly failed again. So it changed its tone to opening up the second front in the East and strengthening air combat and bombing against Japan. However, the former was only a lively show, almost the same as the second front in the West, and even more unrealistic. The latter was because the Japanese army launched an offensive against Zhejiang and Jiangxi to destroy the agricultural countries and bases for bombing Japan, which became a bubble again. In addition, the relationship with India, but unfortunately, it failed to be given attention in the past, and the work of embracing Buddha's feet temporarily could not produce results. At the same time, British imperialism was unwilling to give up its high-pressure policy towards India. Therefore, the relationship between Chongqing and India did not achieve any important success.

(6) Economic Measures

What economic policies did the Chongqing regime have during the ten months or so after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War? The biggest difficulty encountered by the Chongqing regime after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was the economic difficulty. The most important of these were the following: First, the problem of lack of materials. What the Chongqing regime lacked most was industrial manufactured products, especially machinery, machine tools, heavy industrial products, daily necessities, etc. for production tools. Before the Greater East Asia War, the sources of these materials mainly relied on (1) Jieju Burma Road, (2) the Hong Kong line, (3) the smuggling line in the southeast coast, and (4) the northwest highway line. After the war, the Hong Kong line was cut off first, then the Burma Road also became the route for the Japanese army to advance, and then the southeast smuggling route was also completely cut off due to the tight organization of Shanghai and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign. So what was left was only the Northwest Highway line with the weakest transportation capacity. The supply of materials felt unprecedented shortage. Second, the problem of inflation. This problem had already occurred, but due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the despair of export trade, due to the prohibition of the circulation of legal currency in the peaceful area and the inflow of a large amount of legal currency, and more due to the scarcity of materials after the Greater East Asia War, hoarding and speculation became more and more intensified, and the remittances from overseas Chinese were completely stopped, and the sales of public bonds and savings certificates were drastically reduced. Due to these reasons, the phenomenon of inflation has become increasingly serious. According to general estimates, it has exceeded at least 2.5 million yuan. At the same time, due to the increasingly serious phenomenon of inflation and the decline in the price of legal currency, the soaring prices have become more intensified, and the people's livelihood problems and social problems have become more serious. Third, the problem of production. The errors in fiscal and financial policies have caused the stagnation of industrial production and the formation of daily necessities production in a non-結state (raw materials are monopolized and hoarded, talents are only competing for positions and not cultivated, and the products are not immediately available for sale to wait for speculative prices). As for heavy industry, especially the national defense industry, people who operate it are unprofitable and no one cares about it. State-owned and public-owned people are busy with private affairs and lack technical workers, so they cannot proceed according to the plan. Large-scale national defense industries are even more unnecessary. Fourth, the problem of people's livelihood, that is, under the unreasonable fiscal and economic system and the corrupt bureaucratic political system, the people's livelihood has been seriously hindered. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this seriousness has increased even more. On the one hand, a small number of people who make a fortune from the national crisis are plundering the extreme. On the other hand, the livelihood of the vast majority of good people is difficult. Then, what policies has the Chongqing regime used to overcome and solve these difficult problems? First of all, it established a large loan with Britain and the United States on February 2 this year. The loan to Britain was 50 million pounds, and the loan to the United States was 500 million US dollars. In order to use this loan, the Allied Victory Gold Bonds of 100 million yuan and the savings certificates of 100 million yuan were issued in February this year to recirculate the 400 million yuan of currency in order to alleviate the degree of inflation and then reduce the soaring prices, thereby settling the people and living. This could not be regarded as a good way in the first place. The main thing is to see how the government's credit and the process of sales of the gold certificates will be determined, and naturally, it cannot but involve political issues. Then, in March, the Chongqing-US Financial Agreement was established, and the Chongqing-US Lend-Lease Act Agreement was established. Britain and the United States began to provide further assistance to Chongqing to solve the current economic difficulties of Chongqing. At the same time, Chongqing's fiscal and economic affairs had to be further increased the dependence on Britain and the United States. Secondly, on May 5, the National General Mobilization Law was promulgated and implemented, making all economic relations, economic affairs, and economic problems completely subject to strict preparation. Countries with organizations had already had preliminary implementation of this kind of preparation before the war, and they had already been implementing it when the war broke out. However, Chongqing did not implement it until this year, and it cannot but feel that it is too late to implement it. Moreover, the problem is not how the laws and regulations are stipulated, but how the people who implement them are, what the method of implementation is, and whether they can be thoroughly and universally implemented. In today's situation, where many political problems have not been resolved, warlords and bureaucrats in various places are still forming their own systems, and the Chongqing regime is occupied by a few special corrupt figures, the implementation process of this huge general mobilization plan seems to be suspicious, and the result is still that the common people will taste more pain. In addition, for improving people's livelihood, we can only hear the appeals of many people outside the party, but we have not seen what actual actions Chongqing has taken to love the people.

### Brothels Should Obtain Licenses, Customers Must Leave Their Names, and Prostitution Must Leave Their Resident ID Numbers, Prostitutes Must Undergo Medical Examinations Every Week

The Shanghai Times reported that the Bureau of Industry and Commerce has recently ordered that all brothels must obtain licenses from November 1. Regarding this matter, people with good sources of information tend to称 that the Bureau is currently drafting a plan to completely eliminate venereal diseases in Shanghai. According to this plan, anyone entering a brothel must leave their name and resident ID number, so that if a disease is discovered, its source can be traced. Prostitutes must undergo medical examinations every week, and if there is any sign of venereal disease, they will be prohibited from operating. This measure aims to protect public safety. People with venereal diseases often do not restrain themselves, and their generation is the greatest danger to residents. In order to curb the spread of venereal diseases, anyone who goes to a brothel must present their resident ID and leave their name. If the prostitute they contact is infected with venereal disease, it can be found out from whom she was infected. Private prostitutes will also be subject to the same supervision, because the authorities' plan to eliminate the greatest pain in Shanghai will proceed with all efforts.

The registration method is as follows: (1) Pay a registration fee of 7 yuan and 5 cents once, and a donation fee of 4 yuan per month. (2) The number of vehicles is limited to 2,000, but the minimum is 1,500 and the maximum is 6,000. After this matter was issued, the rickshaw merchants in the special zone, in addition to requesting an extension of the registration date, urgently convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures, but no concrete results have been discussed.

### Fan Keling Suffers Insult in Car, French Consulate Opened Trial Yesterday, Lawyer Pulaimei Describes Process

The English Great America Evening Post reported that Fan Keling, the former President of the Bureau of Public Works, was forced to take a public bus in the French Concession. He was refused to purchase a ticket with a broken one-yuan Central Reserve 券and was dragged out of the bus and detained in the police station. He then commissioned Lawyer Pulaimei to file a lawsuit against the French Tram Company with the French Consulate. The French Consulate held a trial on the morning of yesterday (9th). Mr. Fan requested Magistrate Kaobin to convict the French Tram Company of violating the regulations by instructing the ticket seller to refuse to accept broken 券and to pay the litigation costs of 2,000 yuan. According to Lawyer Pulaimei's description of the process, Mr. Fan Keling boarded a public bus at 22 on the Bund at noon on August 7. He was refused to purchase a ticket with a slightly broken one-yuan Central Reserve 券. However, Mr. Fan said that this 券was given to him by the public bus ticket seller yesterday, so he insisted that the 券was usable and refused to change it. There was a ticket inspector who boarded the bus near Mintini Road. After learning about the incident, he asked Mr. Fan to leave the bus, but he refused. So he asked other passengers to board another bus, leaving only Mr. Fan alone on the original bus. He then summoned two Chinese detectives and telephoned the Malan police station to send a Russian detective named Lewitzki to the scene and asked Mr. Fan to go to the police station, but he refused. Then, a French detective, Antulan, also arrived. Then, the Russian detective and the Chinese detective forcibly dragged Mr. Fan out of the bus and took him to the police station. The police chief, Magaron, treated Mr. Fan in a very unpleasant manner and telephoned the French Tram Company. The company requested that he be detained. Only after he was identified as Mr. Fan Keling was he released. The case was adjourned to October 17 for continued trial. At that time, Lawyer Pulaimei will invite six witnesses to testify in court.

The newspaper's broadcast time yesterday was 7:15.

### Jazz Luncheon

The new hotel's creation of a jazz luncheon is a bold attempt by a Chinese restaurant. Can the quiet recuperation from newspapers eliminate Shanghai's sense of novelty and excitement? At twelve noon on the first day, every pair of dancers' hearts were filled as if everyone was praying in different voices. Only then would such a good place in mid to late month not lack a dance floor.

At 12:30 pm, after a lady reported through the microphone, the famous musician Gavchos first selected and played a majestic March. However, the dance floor was quiet and empty. Then came an Overture, but we still looked at each other with a sense of emptiness. I was breaking a sweat for the owner of the New Capital. Admittedly, blowing on a pool of spring water is none of your business, but I still have to think about the guests. Could it be that there isn't a single jazz enthusiast among the seated guests?

When the third, brisk quickstep boogie was played, the guests couldn't hold back any longer. The gaps around the dance floor seemed to emit sounds of wild excitement. The guests also stood up, as if saying who would be bold enough to step out first. But then, with the fourth and fifth pieces, the guests all became bold.

A Chinese restaurant having dancing is likely a new world record. That being said, the daring people should be new. But the New Capital is ultimately lovable; it always stands at the forefront of the times, young, new, and satisfying.

Then came guests performing singing on stage. Several red stars from the Paramount and other dance halls were also invited by the guests. The shadows of waltzes shimmered somewhat divinely. Those who couldn't get a table stood firmly around the dance floor without any politeness, standing at attention. The white-clothed, red-lettered male and female waiters were rushing around, busier than a quick fox trot.

The New Capital's manager, Li Xianying, is skilled at utilizing time. He knows that modern wealthy jazz enthusiasts love both Cantonese cuisine and the thrill of dancing. He also knows that jazz enthusiasts love the New Capital's seating more than elsewhere. Furthermore, he knows that lunchtime currently has more space than other times, and he doesn't increase the tea or food prices.

Thus, the jazz luncheon began on Double Ten Day and will be held every day thereafter. Jazz luncheon has become a kind of newborn in Shanghai (if).

### Seeking National Celebration Through Hardship

— Zhou

I spent National Day in encouragement. I think everyone on this day more deeply reflects on the past, recognizes the present, and hopes for the future. Everyone prays for the everlasting foundation of the country and countless years of peace.

Humbly, without much grand theory, we cannot forget the ironclad fact that self-cultivation leads to family harmony, family harmony leads to national order, and national order leads to world peace. There is absolutely no way that in an era of hardship, individuals can be complacent and decadent, families can be disorganized and negligent, and without vigorous progress and hard work, they can cultivate themselves and harmonize their families. Therefore, to truly celebrate National Day, each individual and each family must shoulder the responsibility of hard work and vigorous progress, so as not to waste National Day and not to be complacent about National Day.

Readers of the family section, if you accumulate good deeds, your family will surely have abundant blessings. When every family has cause for celebration, only then will the whole country celebrate together. We sincerely encourage each other with hard work and wish every reader's family cause for celebration and look forward to an even more splendid and bright National Day next year.

### Infant Sleep

— Zhu Ying

After an infant is born, they should be allowed to sleep alone to develop a habit. If a breastfed child sleeps in the same bed as the mother, it is extremely uncomfortable, the air is easily polluted, and two bad habits are formed.

(A) Infants under three months old should be breastfed no more than once a night. After three months, the child should be able to sleep through the night. This means that breastfeeding should be stopped as much as possible between 9 PM and 10 PM and 5 AM and 6 AM the next morning to allow for rest. This uninterrupted sleep is beneficial for both the child and the adult. If the infant sleeps in the mother's or wet nurse's arms, they wake up more often, so the number of feedings inevitably increases. It is best to sleep immediately after eating and wake up immediately when eating, almost as accurate as a clock. This is of great convenience to both mother and child.

(B) When infants and mothers or wet nurses sleep together, the infant wakes up when the adult moves slightly. Therefore, it is easy for them to develop the habit of waking up during sleep. It may even happen that the adult unknowingly presses on the infant's mouth and nose during deep sleep, resulting in an accident.

In fact, newborns sleep almost all day long. Infants under six months old need to sleep at least sixteen hours in twenty-four hours, twelve hours each night, and four hours each in the morning and afternoon. As for children around one year old, they need to sleep fifteen hours in every twenty-four hours. Originally, sleep is very important for human health. Under no circumstances should the mother sacrifice the infant's sleep for the convenience of herself or others in the family. Many mothers pay too little attention to the infant's sleep problem. Regardless of whether the infant should be sleeping or not, they pick them up and walk around if they are happy. You should know that the bones of children under three months old are soft. If you pick them up, it is easy to hinder their growth. Conversely, it is also not right to let children sleep all day long.

Among children, there are often those who sleep soundly during the day and do not sleep at night, which is quite troublesome for the mother. However, if such children have been given breast milk once at night after crying, they will develop a habit that is not easy to change. To avoid this problem, you should start from the beginning. If the child cries severely at night, you can first change to dry swaddling clothes to see if they can calm down. If they cannot calm down, give them weak tea (do not add sugar) to replace the breast milk. After several nights like this, the child will be able to dislike this tasteless weak tea and not ask for food. If they are very stubborn, you may wish to remove the morning bath every day and replace it with an evening bath. In this way, the child can sleep peacefully due to the fatigue after the bath. Because not being able to get the child to sleep on time is harmful to their health. Having a fixed sleep time for children is not only beneficial to their health but also provides great convenience to the mother. However, it is also not right to let children sleep all day long. As a mother, you should have a fixed time every day to pick up the child and talk to them so that they can gradually learn the language. This is very important.

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Ever since eating hairy taro and boiled edamame pods during the Mid-Autumn Festival, this hairy taro has been like a darling of the times, still active in the market today. In fact, hairy taro doesn't taste good when used in dishes. To make it tasty, you can only boil it, peel it, add oil, soy sauce, and sugar, and braise it together with a whole piece of pork, so that the meat oil and meat juices penetrate into the taro. As for making it vegetarian, you can only mash it, add oil and salt, and put it in a pot and bake it until it's scorched, called "Twilight Love Scorched Taro," which is much more delicious than boiling it in salt water.

### Working Women

— Yi Fan

Editor,

I have repeatedly seen you answer many questions for readers in the family section, and I admire you very much. Now I have a question for you to answer. I grew up in an old-fashioned family. Not long ago, someone introduced me to a marriage prospect. The other party is a female employee at a company. I don't know if marrying a working woman is better than marrying a housewife. Please reply to me as soon as possible.

Yi Fan

Mr. Yi Fan,

It is a very fortunate thing that you are able to carefully consider the issue of marriage. As for whether working women can become excellent spouses, there is no doubt about this. Cornell University in the United States has conducted detailed surveys. According to their conclusions, a working woman has the following advantages:

(1) Because she goes out every day to deal with many people, she knows how to suppress her irritability and will not lose her temper for no reason. (2) She knows the ways of business transactions in the business world and is not extremely selfish. (3) A good supervisor must have taught her the ways of dealing with people. (4) They have handled their own financial problems and can become better financial managers. (5) They know the hardships of work and will be able to understand the hard work of their husbands in the future. (6) Because they come into contact with more people, if they choose you as their husband in the future, it must be because they consider you qualified.

Of course, the above is in general terms, and there are often exceptions. You can conduct a detailed investigation from the introducer's perspective, then go through a period of dating before making a decision about your lifelong event.

### Childbirth Date Calculation Table (Text)

Childbirth is a critical moment for the mother and the first day of the infant's birth. Therefore, the childbirth date should be the most important day in the family. However, in general families, the date of delivery is only estimated based on past experience and intention, without any medical basis or scientific calculation. Therefore, it is often not very accurate, and incidents of delay due to inadequate preparation or being in a different place are often heard. This is really a regret in the family. The September 13 issue of this publication carried an article entitled "Notes for Pregnant Women," which stated that the method for calculating the estimated delivery date is generally to add 280 days to the month and day of the last menstrual period, or subtract three months and add seven days from that day. The method is simple, but it needs to be calculated. Dr. Miller (H.W. Miller, M.A. M.D.) has created a delivery date calculation table. Each cell in the table is divided into upper and lower horizontal rows. The upper row indicates the last menstrual period, and the lower row indicates the date of delivery. For example, if the last menstrual period is March 1, the delivery date is December 6. Dr. Miller is an authority in the medical community and has written many books on medicine and health guidance. The attached table is especially simple and clear at a glance. Therefore, it is hurriedly copied for general families to refer to.

### Twenty Letters from the Ge Family

— Translated by Xu Baiyi

Mr. Lai Laiheng's daughter-in-law contracted the common problems of young people not long after starting work at the company. However, Mr. Ge Laiheng did not listen to his son's words and instead persuaded him with a serious attitude. This attitude is of course very valuable, and it is also the reason for his success.

Letter 7

Common Problems of Youth

Dear Son,

The letter you wrote on the 30th gave me a bad impression, because you cannot work under Mr. Hefa Tongyan, which shows your weakness. As far as the company itself is concerned, it is not interested in whether you like your superior. What we want to know is whether the senior staff in the company like your work.

Mr. Miliken is a straightforward Irishman with a very high temper. However, he can scold you for six days a week and try his best to increase your salary on the seventh day. He has been serving the company since its inception and continues to serve the company.

Young people like you will eventually have a Mr. Miliken above you. If it's not Miliken, then it must be Jones or Smith, because without these people, you simply cannot learn the skills to manage the catering company unless you are prepared to be a pastor or doctor or other industry but even if you change jobs, you can’t immediately be in charge.

So if possible you should like that old Mr. Miliken but you absolutely mustn't make him dislike you it is natural for people above to criticize people below if you think your boss is bad then you can think that the people who give out the money also know this secret you must remember if you have no faults you don't have to apply temper if you have faults then you should hold down your temper

I can tell you that Miliken is not the brightest person in the whole company, but he is very loyal to me and to the company. When you have worked for the company as long as I have, you will definitely know the value of loyalty. Loyalty is a commodity that has no market price, but you cannot pay too high a price to obtain it. You can entrust your money to any number of people, but you should feel difficult when you entrust your reputation to others.

Many young people come to the company to look for jobs. They often complain about how hopeless the previous company was and how the colleagues they worked with were difficult to get along with. I am unwilling to hire these young people because once these young people are hired, they will definitely criticize me and everything about my company. I think that we should only say good things about the deceased, and we should praise and not criticize the living, let alone a company that pays salaries.

Recently I noticed that you like to puff up your chest and walk around in all parts of the company. Of course, there is nothing in your head that can show off the front of your shirt, but your busy colleagues have no time to talk to you.

We will be back soon this place is often insufficient in weight so I will immediately find out where the leak is and immediately take necessary measures.

Your father, Ge Laiheng
