### The Active Japanese Air Force: No Change in the Battle of Xin'dao (Singapore Island); British Forces Await Japanese Attack on Australia; Long Broadcast States Reinforcements are on the Way

Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese planes and artillery continued to bombard Singapore today. Japanese aircraft also intensified their attacks on British positions in central Burma. As for the Japanese ground forces, it is reported that small units are crossing the Salween River westward.

Singapore, 3rd (Havas) - An official communique has been released stating that in the past twenty-four hours, Japanese aircraft have been extremely active over Singapore, repeatedly bombing military targets and causing several fires. However, casualties were very light.

Tokyo, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - According to war reports from Xinshan (Johor Bahru), the gasoline depot at Seletar Fortress in Singapore, which caught fire after being hit the previous morning, was still burning yesterday. The fire was very intense.

Singapore, 4th (Reuters) - Japanese aircraft continued to attack Singapore yesterday. British air defense forces actively resisted. British and American forces anxiously await a land attack. According to today's Far East British Command communique, there are no changes to report in the battle situation. British artillery shelled Japanese motorized transport units in Xinshan. Xin'dao (Singapore Island) was attacked several times by Japanese aircraft yesterday, suffering slight damage, but there was no Japanese aircraft activity over Xin'dao from last night until this morning.

London, 3rd (Havas) - The Daily Telegraph reported today that while the Japanese army is developing an offensive against Singapore, although we will soon be unable to use the island's airfield, it is not impossible for our planes to operate over Singapore. This is because there are other bases within the operating range of our fighter planes, presumably airfields in Sumatra or the Dutch East Indies.

London, 3rd (Reuters) - Military commentators say that there is little news from the Far East today. The Japanese are apparently concentrating their forces in an attempt to attack Singapore. The preparation period will take some time, so this battle will clearly not be easy. Japanese aircraft have begun to intensify attacks on Singapore Island. The British air force bases there are very exposed and are unlikely to be useful in defense. Japanese aircraft have also bombed Surabaya, the main Dutch naval base on Java Island. This shows the extent of Japanese air operations. There are unconfirmed reports that the Japanese army has broken through the upper reaches of the Salween River. It is possible that Japan may temporarily refrain from attacking Singapore and shift its offensive to Burma, aiming to conquer the Dutch East Indies through continuous attacks. Currently, Japan is in a completely dominant position in land, sea, and air.

The Situation on Singapore Island

Xinshan, 4th (Domei News Agency) - The scenery of Singapore is not very clear from here, but with binoculars, all movements are clearly visible, as if one were in Singapore. The British positions are also in sight. A vessel with three smokestacks, resembling a cruiser, was found aground on the beach. There are no people around the British naval headquarters. On the highway connecting the military port to Singapore city, military trucks are busy traveling, seemingly moving supplies to Singapore city. Part of the highway near the naval base is blocked to obscure the view, so it is impossible to see the vehicles traveling. No citizens are seen on the road, presumably having fled to the countryside. The area is full of fortresses, which are disguised, but upon closer inspection, the gunports of the fortresses can be seen pointing towards Xinshan. Near the military port, there are twenty-six heavy oil tanks that were bombed by Japanese aircraft. Five of them are still burning. The extent of the damage to the naval docks can also be seen through binoculars. There are only four anti-aircraft positions in the area, all on the right side of the Causeway. Behind the anti-aircraft guns is Seletar Airfield, but there are no fighters or bombers taking off. There are quite a few transport planes taking off, perhaps retreating towards the Dutch East Indies.

Bern, Switzerland, 3rd (Havas) - The "United News" recently received a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that although Singapore is surrounded, life is as peaceful as usual. The purchase of fruits and vegetables has been restricted a few days ago. The authorities have also drafted a plan to plant various vegetables in all arable land. However, the issue of drinking water is still a concern for the authorities. It is understood that the authorities have taken all necessary measures to prevent a shortage of drinking water. Although the situation is extremely serious, theaters and cinemas are still operating as usual.

Wavell Encourages British Troops

Singapore, 4th (Reuters) - General Wavell, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Southwest Pacific, today sent a telegram to the British troops besieged in the fortress of Singapore Island, encouraging them. The telegram stated briefly, "We must buy time to wait for the reinforcements that Britain and the United States are currently sending to the Eastern battlefield. You must fight for every inch of land. Our allies, the Dutch, are determined to sacrifice and are implementing this policy throughout the Dutch East Indies. I hope you will no longer have the thought of retreat and that the defense of Singapore will be remembered like Tobruk."

Stockholm, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from London, British newspapers and the public are quite concerned about the fate of Rangoon, because if Rangoon is occupied and the Burma Road is sealed off, China will have no supply route. British newspapers believe that the situation in Singapore is also extremely serious and that only a large number of fighter planes can save Singapore. This squadron must be stationed in Sumatra, because Singapore's three airfields are within range of Japanese artillery.

### Gu Weijun's Speech in England on the Importance of Singapore

London, 3rd (Havas) - Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, recently delivered a speech at the Kilt Hall here, stating briefly that Singapore's position is important, so its safety not only determines who obtains endless resources, but also determines who gains a strategic advantage in the global war. If the Japanese army can occupy Singapore, the South Seas will be controlled by Japan. If that happens, it will greatly help the large-scale pincer strategy planned by the Axis powers. In other words, Germany and Japan will advance simultaneously at that time. The German army will attack eastward from the Caucasus, Iran, and Iraq, while the Japanese army will attack westward from its new positions in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.

In addition, our army officer, Lieutenant General Pierce, sustained minor injuries during the battle.

### Unified Command of Allied Forces in the Pacific; Naval Commander-in-Chief May be Appointed First

Washington, 3rd (Havas) - Officials from the Army and Navy here said that the new developments in the Pacific War and the "repeated opening of new battlefields in the Pacific in recent days" have made it necessary to unify the command of the Allied naval, land, and air forces now fighting in the Pacific. Regarding this matter, British and American military officials are reportedly considering it. As a result of repeated requests from the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth of Australia, the first step will likely be to appoint a Naval Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Pacific, so that naval command can be unified first. Admiral Helfrich is currently only the Naval Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, and Admiral Nimitz is the Commander of the Hawaiian Fortress. Since the Pacific War is now a large-scale naval war, it is appropriate to have unified command.

Stockholm, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - Yesterday, information received from Washington stated that the location of the Supreme Military Council of the Allied Forces in the Pacific will reportedly be in Washington.

Washington - Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook, in a speech to the National Press Association, stated that there is an urgent need for Allied nations to coordinate their operational strategies and objectives in the Pacific.

If the Japanese army breaks through the defensive line between Asia and Australia, the Japanese army can attack the rear of the Middle East front. To avoid this, the troops and supplies needed in the Pacific must be shipped as quickly as possible. The Dutch East Indies needs airplanes, anti-aircraft guns, submarines, and other small boats. The U.S. government is now fully aware of the seriousness of the situation. Van Mook also commented on the importance of battleships. He believes that battleships are not important in the current war because the sea area of the current operation is small and combat is hindered. Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens spoke at the same location, saying that the United Kingdom is also well aware of the seriousness of the situation and feels the problem on the path to assistance.

Cairo, 3rd (Havas) - King Farouk met with British Ambassador Lampson today for discussions. The content of the talks was related to the current cabinet crisis in Egypt. According to informed sources here, the Egyptian cabinet's resignation was not only due to the issue of severing relations with France, but also due to the national food crisis, which was a major reason. During the most recent meeting of the House of Representatives, various parties strongly criticized the government's improper handling of agricultural affairs. Some members were shocked that Egypt, such a fertile country, was suffering from famine. The wheat stored last year will be completely consumed by the end of this month, and the new wheat will not be harvested until April of this year.

### Population Census Proceeding Smoothly with the Assistance of Postal Workers

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that the population census conducted by the Concession authorities is still proceeding smoothly this morning (the 4th). Approximately 300,000 census forms have already been issued in the International Settlement, and the same number of forms will be issued again from tomorrow (the 5th) until Friday. The Western District is relatively small, and only about 1,000 forms have been distributed to foreign residents in the district, and the progress is quite satisfactory. The census in this district is expected to be completed before February 20th. The population census in the two Concessions is expected to be completed around February 10th.

Regarding the census in the French Concession, in addition to deploying police officers, postal workers from the Masnan Road Post Office have been borrowed to assist. It is understood that these postal workers assisting the French police in the census are not all from the Masnan Road Post Office. Due to restrictions on automobile traffic and the shortage of gasoline in the two Concessions, the five vehicles used by the Postal Administration's main and branch offices to transport packages have also been unable to operate. As a result, the Postal Administration drew seventy messengers and postal workers from various offices to transport these packages by bicycle. Now, the French Municipal Council has requested the Postal Administration to borrow postal workers to assist in the census within the French Concession. The Postal Administration has assigned these workers who transport packages to carry out this task, and the French Municipal Council will provide 15 gallons of gasoline daily to allow the five vehicles transporting packages to continue operating without affecting postal services. These postal workers have been carrying out the census work within the French Concession since the 1st of this month, and the French Municipal Council also sends gasoline to the main office every day for the vehicles transporting packages to operate.

Once completed, they should be submitted by the responsible person to the Council's office number 803 for verification.

As of now, more than 600 registration forms have been collected, but many have not yet been collected. Please collect and fill in the forms as soon as possible. Do not delay any further. The registration should be completed by 4:00 PM on the 11th of this month. As for factories run by Japanese merchants and those currently controlled by the Japanese authorities, they do not need to register.

### The Municipal Council Handles Registration of Charcoal

The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that anyone holding more than 150 kilograms (or 300 catties) of charcoal in stock should report to the Council for registration before the 8th of this month. However, charcoal owned by Japanese residents that has already been registered with the Japanese authorities does not need to be registered with the Council again. When registering the stock, the weight of each type of charcoal should be indicated in kilograms, and the types should be determined according to their place of origin (such as Huzhou, Changxing, Jiaxing, Xiashi, Ninghai, Hangzhou). The total number of baskets of stock, as well as the weight of each basket, together with the location of the stock, should be clearly indicated. Registration forms can be obtained from the Council's office number 333. Once completed, they should be sent to that office for verification as soon as possible.

### Only Over 900 Cars Running in the Two Concessions; Authorities Will Re-select When Renewing Permits Next Month

In order to strengthen restrictions on automobiles, the authorities in the two Concessions have reduced the number of running cars to slightly over 1,000 and have issued permits, which car owners should affix to the windows for identification. The first phase of permits stopped being issued on the 23rd of last month, and their validity was also stipulated to end on the 31st of last month. The second phase of new permits began to be issued on February 1st, and the number of vehicles approved to run has decreased even more compared to last month.

In the French Concession, only slightly over 400 vehicles have been approved to run this month, a decrease of about 100 vehicles compared to the 500 or so vehicles last month. Therefore, there are currently only over 900 cars in the two Concessions with running permits. The validity period of this second phase of permits is roughly one month as well. Next month, new permits will be renewed, and there will be another strict selection by the Concession authorities.

After the continuous rain and snow blocked the roads, the supply of early Japonica rice from the Southern gangs has become less and less, and the appetite of the households in this street is still greedy.

### Citrus Fruits (II)

— Gao Jiannong

What is strange is that the Jin Dynasty scholar Ji Han, in his work "Descriptions of Plants and Trees of the South," sometimes describes the shapes of other plants in great detail. Yet, regarding the shape of the "tangerine," he uses only eleven characters: "Tangerines have white flowers, red fruit, fragrant peel, and a delicious taste." Regarding the "mandarin orange," he only says, "The mandarin orange belongs to the tangerine family. It has a particularly sweet and delicious flavor. Some are yellow, some are reddish, and those that are broad are called 'pot mandarin oranges.'" Perhaps he thought that mandarin oranges were native to our country and familiar to everyone, so there was no need to waste ink on depicting them? We now know that mandarin oranges belong to the genus Citrus of the Rutaceae family because they propagate so easily.

Spring and Autumn

### Eating New Year's Eve Dinner and Abstaining from Killing

— Liao Mu

"The chilling wind and bitter rain sadden people." Experiencing this scene at the end of the lunar year truly gives one the feeling that the Buddha described as "unspeakable." Yet, time refuses to wait for people and has finally drifted by gently and quietly arrived once more. Yesterday was "Beginning of Spring," and we will soon welcome the "Spring Festival."

In ordinary times, after a year of hard work, taking a short break to decorate, offering thanks at year's end, and the whole family reuniting to happily eat New Year's Eve dinner is one of life's pleasures. A few cups of unfiltered wine, a few dishes of sliced raw fish and meat, in terms of human feelings, no one would dare say it is too wasteful, and it has its own significance for the holiday. Even if one displays some extravagance, killing some chickens and ducks, and boiling some fish and meat, relying on the blessings of the spirits and ancestors, it seems to be a right that those who are bustling and lively should have.

However, in this day and age, with the holiday at hand, if one wants to share more of the soup and cannot avoid following tradition, I think a group of those who buy rice at fixed prices would truly frown and only give a bitter smile. This is somewhat distant from some serious Buddhists and revolutionaries, but "the pheasant on the mountain ridge, now is the time, now is the time," that was then, and this is now.

Some people still like to stubbornly adhere to tradition, eating their New Year's Eve dinner with gusto, unwilling to engage in conservation. But how will tomorrow be after this good night? Therefore, those who are not too optimistic should plan for how to support life after the good night and holiday. Matters of ghosts and spirits are distant and vague; the pleasure of the palate is only for the present. This evokes a special emotion.

The Chinese Moral Improvement Society is advocating abstaining from killing to save lives, saving creatures to save people. Although some may think it is a commonplace, upon reflection, it does have meaning today. "It is better for the neighbor to the west to offer a simple sacrifice of vegetables than for the neighbor to the east to slaughter an ox." A simple sacrifice is to offer boiled vegetables. Being cautious to the end and remembering those who are far away, one must not forget the fundamentals, and one must also hold the concept of "compassion for heaven and pity for mankind, being saddened by the suffering of one's kind." Finding joy in hardship is somewhat embarrassing; saving on waste can still do something beneficial for others.

Qing Dynasty scholar Peng Jiqing wrote a poem on New Year's Eve: "The neighbor's chickens crow all night, vying to be the first to announce dawn; here I pass the fifth watch in desolation; blood stains a thousand knives, flowing endlessly, while accompanying wine and talk of spring's arrival." I also have a feeling of desolation, alas!

### Stage and Screen

"The Hunter's Story," co-starring Walter Pidgeon and Joan Bennett, is a sensational thriller that Shanghai film fans have been eagerly awaiting. It is now known that the film is in Hong Kong and will come to Shanghai as soon as the situation stabilizes.

Simone Simon has been absent from the screen for a long time since "Seventh Heaven." This spring, she accepted an invitation from Dianlei Hua and co-starred in a film with Walter Huston called "All That Money Can Buy." It is said that this film was shipped to Shanghai before the outbreak of the Pacific War and will soon be released to the public.
— Duo Bao

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

17.  Destination

"I...already...very...very much need to...have...a...permanent...destination...destination!" Begonia's voice was as low as a whisper. "Child..., what...what I can't stop worrying...worrying about...is...that you don't...don't have...a...a temporary...destination..."

As he spoke, he slowly pulled a photograph from under his pillow.

"To...you...," he fixed his lifeless eyes on this photograph that had never left him for more than a decade, and said haltingly, "I...I also...fee...feel very...very sorry.... In the beginning..., I...was...was because...I didn't want...want...you...to see...see my...ugly...face..., and also...didn't want...want you...you to follow...me...and suffer..., that's why I forcibly...forcibly...avoided...avoided you.... Now...now it's...too late...to regret...."

Seeing that he was having difficulty speaking, Mei Bao quickly poured half a glass of boiled water, mixed it with the asthma medication left by the doctor, held back her tears, walked over to feed it to him, and at the same time took the photograph he was holding in his hand.

"Dad, rest, rest! Tomorrow we will definitely go and hire a better doctor, no matter what, we must cure your illness." Mei Bao said very childishly. (325)

### "Awakening and Dancing to the Rooster's Crow"

— Wang Qiushui

Reportedly: "Various entertainment venues have suffered heavy losses due to early closing hours and have jointly petitioned the authorities, requesting that the business hours be appropriately extended under the principle of electricity conservation."

Reportedly: "The authorities reiterated the previous order, strictly limiting the closing time of entertainment venues to before 10 p.m. every night."

Reportedly: "A new invention, the breakfast dance, starts at 9 a.m. every day."

We cannot help but admire the Shanghai dance hall operators. In order to plan for their own business and to seek happiness for the public (entertainment is a necessity for everyone to relieve fatigue, which can be called "public happiness," presumably this is not excessive praise), they do not hesitate to run into such a big snag. However, with a little brainstorming, they followed the luncheon dance, tea dance, and evening dance with the breakfast dance. Dancing is available anytime, anywhere, thus increasing business income and providing convenience for the public.

As the saying goes, "A big belly is good for business." The businessman who invented the breakfast dance should be considered "good" at adapting to the times. From the perspectives of business acumen and adapting to the current environment, the breakfast dance has its own value. Since the night market has disappeared, people's sleep will inevitably increase. Sleep is like eating; overeating is harmful to the stomach, and excessive sleep can also cause the brain to become muddled. In this way, after getting up early, one can go to the dance hall to dance for an hour or two to "wake up the brain" and have breakfast at the same time, achieving both goals and ensuring a day of vigor. It is said that dancing has the meaning of combining exercise with entertainment. It is hoped that the ladies of Shanghai will go dancing, because dancing can lead to getting up early, and getting up early can strengthen the body. The "breakfast dance" is only a "token gesture" in the dance program, but it provides great help.

After the implementation of the new time, 9 o'clock is 8 o'clock. From now on, in the faint morning light, dance partners must run eagerly. Who says that Shanghai people's lives are decadent and uninspired? Do you not see that today, she or they have already started practicing "awakening and dancing to the rooster's crow"?

### People Under the Snow

— Hua Jing

During the last two snowfalls on the isolated island, the number of people who froze to death on the streets that night increased sharply. There is a saying: "Three feet of snow in Jiangnan means ten years of abundance." Now it can be changed to "One night of snow in Shanghai, the number of corpses on the streets increases!" Many people say: These many people who froze to death are all addicted to white powder and red pills, they brought it on themselves and deserve to die. However, child corpses account for more than half of them, indicating that those who died on the road were not all drug addicts. Please, those who are sleeping in warm beds and dreaming good dreams, have mercy and think of a way to save these pitiful worms under the snow! The cold weather will continue for a long time, and who knows how many people under the snow are still "waiting in line"!

### Wang Cilong Passed Away in Hong Kong

— Tai Xu

Today, I must report another unfortunate news to the readers: Wang Laowu Wang Cilong has passed away in Hong Kong.

Wang Cilong was also a veteran on the silver screen. In the era of Da Zhonghua Baihe, when "Silver Screen Overlord" Wang Yuanlong was in the limelight, Cilong could be said to be his right-hand man. "Beauty Trap" and "Four Heroes of the Wang Family" were all highly sought-after works. In these fifteen or sixteen years, many movie stars have declined, but the two of them remained unmoved. After the war, Cilong was the resident director of the Guolian Film Company. Hu Die's "Madame Butterfly" was originally scheduled to be released at the end of the year, but now it has not only been suspended due to "August 8th," but it is also a permanent farewell!

This unfortunate news was sent by Wang Yuanlong in a letter from Hong Kong yesterday. News of other film people staying in Hong Kong was not mentioned.
