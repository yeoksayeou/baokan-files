Stockholm, 28th (Haitong) - London reports that military circles here believe the initial British offensive in Egypt is not yet over. There are reportedly three layers of minefields in front of the German lines. It is claimed that British forces have broken through two zones, but the third is very difficult to penetrate. Infantry battles continue day and night. Allied air forces are doing their best to prevent the Germans from organizing a counterattack. In general, recent reports from London do not provide a clear account of the current situation in the Egyptian campaign.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong) - Regarding the fighting on the Alamein front, Haitong News Agency has learned the following details from military sources: The fighting in western Egypt was very fierce yesterday. British forces attacked the northern front line along the Mediterranean coast, launching repeated attacks on Italian defenses. In addition to British tank units, New Zealand infantry also participated. British and American air forces were also deployed. The enemy's offensive was very fierce, but has achieved no notable victories in the past four days. The German side has laid dense minefields and established strong defenses, causing the British advance to stall. German and Italian defensive forces used artillery fire to inflict heavy casualties on the British, destroying 38 tanks.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong) - Military personnel in Berlin announced early this morning that on the fourth day of the Alamein battle, British forces had ceased their offensive on the central and southern fronts. German military personnel believe that British forces have suffered heavy tank losses and numerous casualties, and must await reinforcements before launching a counterattack. Berlin, 28th (Haitong) Urgent dispatch - According to military authorities here last night, the large-scale British offensive on the northern flank of Alamein has come to a halt as of yesterday.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong) - Last night, news came that on the fourth day of the British offensive in North Africa, the British Eighth Army made no progress. Axis forces continue to hold the western Egyptian front. The fighting near Alamein is fierce. The British attempted to break through Axis positions under the cover of heavy artillery and tanks, but the leading edge of the British tanks was cut off by an Italian flank attack. Many tanks were destroyed by artillery fire. New Zealand and Indian troops, aided by tanks, launched an offensive in the middle of the line, but also suffered heavy losses.

### British Landing at Marsa Matruh Fails

Bern, 27th (Havas) - It has just been learned that British forces in North Africa suddenly attempted a landing east of Marsa Matruh last night, attempting to attack the right flank of the Axis forces in the Alamein area. However, it is reported that when the British forces landed in torpedo boats, they were attacked by German and Italian air forces, sinking one ship carrying ammunition. Other troop transports were also hit. It is said that the British in the Middle East have managed to gain ground within enemy lines, thus expanding their territory and being able to hold new positions. According to Berlin sources, the German side claims that on the fourth day of the British offensive, the Axis defensive positions remained firm due to their great depth and the defense by German and Italian mechanized units. Although the British Eighth Army has transferred a large number of fresh troops as reinforcements and launched a fierce attack on the center, they have not achieved any decisive advantage at any point on the front line. The British exerted the greatest pressure on the left and right flanks of Rommel's forces. The general situation is as follows: (1) In the coastal area of Alamein, British forces, under the cover of heavy artillery and 200 tanks, attempted to break through the Axis line, but were repelled by Italian forces. The vanguard of the British armored column was surrounded and eventually annihilated by flat-trajectory guns, and many British tank drivers were captured. (2) In the center, New Zealand and Indian troops also launched an offensive under the cover of artillery and tanks, attempting to break through the Axis minefields. The fighting lasted all day without success. By dusk, they were repelled by our forces. At the outposts in front of the minefields, the British suffered heavy casualties from our rapid fire and mine explosions, and were finally forced to retreat to their original positions. (3) In the south, the enemy's offensive has weakened. On the 26th of this month, the British High Command dispatched several armored columns to find weaknesses in our line, attempting to attack our position on the flank through the El Qattara Depression. Fortunately, our defending troops resisted bravely, destroying many enemy tanks and thwarting all enemy attempts. (4) Axis bombers and fighters were active, constantly bombing British transport columns and tank columns, without end. In addition, Berlin sources say that German and Italian forces are working well together in this North African campaign. Although the Axis forces are on the defensive, they are making daily gains. The soldiers under General Rommel are encouraged by an unshakable belief in victory, and their morale is very high.

### German Forces Launch Another Fierce Attack on Stalingrad Bloody Battle Northeast of Tuapse Soviet Union Strengthens Defenses on the East Bank of the Volga Large-Scale Fighting Also Occurring on the Central and Northern Fronts

Fuhrer Headquarters, 28th (Haitong) - According to the German High Command, German forces have occupied a small hill southeast of Novorossiysk and another small hill east of Tuapse. German aircraft attacked Tuapse, destroying a 6,000-ton merchant ship. German forces on the Terek front are also continuing to advance. German forces in Stalingrad have advanced from the east of the bakery factory to the Volga River. German aircraft are also assisting in the fighting. Soviet counterattacks in the southern part of the city have been repulsed. Soviet railways and the Caspian Sea region have also been attacked, destroying three trains and sinking three freighters (totaling 3,000 tons). An oil tanker, a freighter, and two escort ships were also hit. Romanian forces on the Don front also repelled enemy forces.

Moscow, 27th (Havas) - The Supreme Command announced tonight that there was a bloody battle in the Stalingrad area and northeast of Tuapse in the past day. There were no major changes in other areas of the front.

Moscow, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Soviet Information Bureau announced the battle situation on the night of the 27th as follows: (1) Fierce fighting between German and Soviet forces continues in Stalingrad and the northeast of Tsarev Broz. (2) German infantry units have once again launched fierce attacks on workers' residences and factory areas in Stalingrad.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong) - According to news from Berlin military circles, the German offensive in eastern and western Caucasus will soon achieve a major victory. The fighting in the Tuapse area and the Grozny area is progressing smoothly. After German mountain troops occupied the Somyan Pass, a key point on the highway between Mezguy and Tuapse, they are now only 12 kilometers from Tuapse. Fierce fighting continues in the Grozny area, especially near Nalchik. German progress in the area has been hampered by a tributary of the Terek River. The banks of the tributary are very high and difficult to attack but easy to defend. Moreover, the Soviet defenses are strong with minefields. However, they were eventually broken through by German forces, and several Soviet divisions are in danger of being encircled and annihilated. German forces have encountered fierce Soviet resistance, but have still made considerable gains in territory. Due to improved weather conditions, large-scale fighting is also occurring on the central and northern fronts of the Eastern Front. In the Stalingrad industrial area, German forces have occupied several buildings between the "October Revolution" steel plant and the Great Bakery Factory, and have also reached the Volga River in that area. The Soviet forces are making every effort to strengthen the defenses on the eastern bank of the Volga, attempting to send reinforcements across the river at night, but were bombed by German aircraft. The only railway line remaining for the Soviet forces in Stalingrad to receive supplies is a branch line of the railway between Astrakhan and Saratov.

### Darlan Passes Through Oran Inspects Port Facilities Governor General Anet of Madagascar Telegraphs Loyalty to the French Colonial Ministry

Algiers, French North Africa, 28th (Havas) - Admiral Darlan arrived here yesterday by plane from Oran for an inspection. He is staying with General Juin, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces in North Africa.

Oran, North Africa, 27th (Havas) - Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French National Defense, departed for home after inspecting the port of Dakar. He passed through here today and paid his respects to the graves of the soldiers who died in the Battle of Kebir during the previous British attack on the port of Oran. He also visited the port to pay respects to the officers and men who died on the battleship Bretagne. In addition, he inspected the port facilities. After completing the inspection, he flew to Algiers with General Jouin, the commander of the garrison.

Vichy, 28th (Haitong) - Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces, expressed his satisfaction with the impressions he gained after visiting Morocco, Marrakech, Rabat, Casablanca, and Fez. He has sent a telegram to General Juin, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces in North Africa, expressing his congratulations.

Vichy, 27th (Havas) - French semi-official sources recently stated that the importance of the recent trip to West Africa by Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of National Defense, has been increased by the renewed activity of the Egyptian border war. Darlan delivered a speech, emphasizing that the French West African colonies must implement self-defense and resist all aggression with their main forces. This is a restatement of the neutrality principle of these territories in the face of the impending war on the border. However, the situation in French West Africa is different from that in French Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Therefore, after Darlan conveyed Marshal Pétain's instructions to the Dakar authorities, he continued his journey, visiting Morocco and Algeria. Darlan was well received in Rabat, the political center of Morocco and its capital, as well as Casablanca, its economic center, and Fez, its religious center. The Sultan of Morocco took this opportunity to reiterate his loyalty to France. Admiral Darlan replied that "France, after the end of this war, will know how to appreciate the attitude of these territories." French newspapers, commenting on Darlan's speech, generally said that French territories will resist any aggression. This has generated an even greater reaction in the newspapers in the occupied zone. For example, L'œuvre reported that "If Dakar is invaded, it will call on all French people to act together."

Vichy, 27th (Havas) - Governor General Anet of Madagascar telegraphed Colonial Minister Brevier, stating that since the British first attacked the port of Diego Suarez on the island in early May of this year, they have made grand declarations, but the determination of the people of the island to be loyal to France has not wavered. The British have tried their best to entice and even coerce our troops to defect to the enemy, but no one, whether frontline soldiers or reservists, has surrendered to the enemy. This is truly something to be proud of. Furthermore, until the time that communication between me and the various chiefs was cut off, there were daily expressions of determination to be loyal from native officials and civilians on Madagascar. In short, Madagascar has decided to be forever attached to France.

### Switzerland Awaits British Response; Novel Incendiary Bombs Dropped in French Free Zone

Geneva, 28th (Reuters) - The Swiss Federal Council decided yesterday to await the British response to Switzerland's protest regarding repeated British aircraft violations of Swiss neutrality before taking further measures. The Swiss Ambassador to Britain recently received instructions from the government to lodge a serious protest with Britain. Swiss newspapers are requesting that the authorities first publish the British response to the previous Swiss protest.

Geneva, 27th (Havas) - The Federal Administrative Council met today to study a detailed report on the recent repeated violations of Swiss airspace by the British Air Force. The report also mentioned the steps taken regarding this incident. The Minister to Britain has lodged a strong protest with the British government. Once the reply is received, the Administrative Council will re-examine the matter.

Vichy, 27th (Havas) - The Information Office has just released a statement saying: "In the past ten days, the British have dropped no less than two hundred novel incendiary bombs of various kinds in the French Free Zone, either dropped from airplanes or floated down using small parachutes. These incendiary bombs come in approximately three different forms: one is bag-shaped, filled with wood shavings soaked in flammable liquid, with a capacity of about one gallon, and equipped with an explosive device; the other two shapes are either pint-sized bottles or ordinary iron cans, all filled with highly concentrated chemical fuel. Consequently, fires have broken out in the provinces of Savoy, Upper Savoy, and Vienna, near the Italian border, due to these bombs, and several granaries have been burned. The damage is particularly severe for countries with food shortages. Judging from the markings on the bombs and the way they fall, they are undoubtedly British-made. Thus, France's former ally not only blockades France to besiege its people but has recently intensified its efforts and is effectively destroying its harvested grain."

### Remains of the Luntes to Receive State Funeral at Month's End

### General Election in Southern Ireland Next Year

Dublin, 27th (Havas) - Southern Irish Minister of Supply, Lemass, stated in a speech today, "There is a possibility of an election in Southern Ireland next year. However, anti-government movements have recently been discovered within the country, which poses a major threat to government actions. Those engaged in this often incite the masses to engage in terrorist activities, which could endanger the country's independence and security. I believe the people must support the government because, in the current international situation, true neutrality does not consist of merely proclaiming neutrality but depends on the government's ability to employ capable officials, use diplomacy, and deal with it properly to be effective."

The people of National Socialist Germany deeply sympathize with the victory of the Fascist revolution. Currently, Germany and Italy are fighting side by side, and Jews, plutocracy, and Marxism will be destroyed. I and the German people congratulate you and the Blackshirts with this firm belief."

The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated, "In this battle, the enemy staked their total strength to determine the outcome of the Pacific War, sending a large number of ships and elite land forces, making a desperate gamble, but their attempt has now been crushed by our army."

Lisbon, 28th (Reuters) - U.S. Second Fleet Commander Admiral Edward declared in Cleveland yesterday that the losses of the U.S. Pacific Fleet have been significant, "but these losses are just beginning." He continued, stating that several Japanese submarines participated in the attack on the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp." He refused to disclose other U.S. naval losses in the Solomons, only saying that although the losses are large, the U.S. Navy is determined to continue fighting.

Pearl Harbor, 27th (Havas) - Officials here announced that many crew members of the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp" died after it was sunk by a submarine in the South Pacific, including International News Service reporter Singer. According to Captain Hillman, the ship was hit by a torpedo at the moment of turning. At the same time, naval circles here believe that the loss of the "Wasp" is a major blow to the U.S. Navy in the South Pacific, because the islands in the area are scattered, and air combat is extremely important.

Washington, 27th (Havas) - The Navy Department has just announced that since the U.S. entered the war, it has lost a total of 15,811 officers and men, including 4,454 killed, 1,592 wounded, and 9,769 missing.

Grew Advises All Americans Not to Be Overly Optimistic

New York, 27th (Havas) - Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, gave another radio address here today, advising the people of the country not to be overly optimistic and to recognize the various difficulties currently encountered in the war against Japan. His warning stated, "It would be a great mistake to assume that Japan cannot withstand the bombing of incendiary bombs or that the Japanese people will succumb to hunger."

Lisbon, 28th (Reuters) - London reports that Admiral Stark, commander of the U.S. naval patrol in European waters, gave a radio address to the American people in London this morning. He stated that the navy alone cannot defeat the enemy, but without maintaining the traffic on the sea lanes, a second front cannot be established. His words are profound and thought-provoking.

Somewhere on the German Border, 27th (Havas) - Rear Admiral Gato recently published an article in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, briefly stating that in the past three years, the Allied powers have lost warships approximately equal to more than three times the strength of the German Navy fleet in 1939. Considering only those that the Allies have already acknowledged or have been confirmed to have sunk, there are 11 battleships, 9 aircraft carriers, 1 aircraft transport ship, 10 heavy cruisers, 25 light cruisers, 103 destroyers, 9 gunboats, 14 auxiliary cruisers, 1 auxiliary aircraft carrier, and 244 other types of auxiliary warships.

The newspapers in the country published the news in prominent positions. The newspapers pointed out that the loss of the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp" and the destroyer "Porter" was not announced until weeks later. The dismissal of Vice Admiral Gormley, Commander of the South Pacific Naval Forces, shows the United States' concern about the situation in the South Pacific. The remarks made by his successor, Vice Admiral Halsey, also indicate the precariousness of the situation.

At that time, Foreign Minister Togo appointed Matsumoto, Director of the Treaty Bureau, Shigemitsu, Director of the Second South Seas Division, and Sato, Director of the First Treaty Division, as committee members. Thai Ambassador Direk also appointed Councilor Daphi, First Secretary Ratanan, and Second Secretary Danat as committee members to conduct negotiations. The committee members from both sides recently held two meetings, carefully reviewed and slightly revised the original plan, and agreed to formally sign it. In total, it took six months from the formal start of negotiations to the establishment of the agreement.

Strengthening Bilateral Relations

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - After Japan and Thailand concluded this cultural agreement, not only will the close relationship between the two countries be further strengthened, but also the military and economic cooperation between the two countries can be strengthened through culture. Therefore, its significance is extremely important. At the same time, the two countries are jointly working to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the great cause of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is especially worth looking forward to. On November 15, Showa 13 (1938), Japanese Minister to Hungary Matsumiya and Hungarian Foreign Minister Drezky signed an agreement in Budapest concerning the friendly relations and cultural agreement between the two countries. Following that, on November 25, Showa 13 (1938), Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and German Ambassador to Japan Ott signed an agreement here concerning the cultural cooperation between the two countries in the spirit of anti-communism. On March 23, Showa 14 (1939), Japan and Italy signed a similar agreement here. Following that, on September 23, Showa 15 (1940), the Japanese Ambassador to Brazil and the Foreign Minister of that country signed the Japan-Brazil Cultural Agreement in Rio de Janeiro. The focus of the above cultural agreements is to seek the common goals of the two countries through culture among the people of the two countries, in addition to military and economic cooperation. The implementation strategies are mainly: (1) exchanging trainee students, (2) exchanging international students, (3) exchanging broadcasts, etc. Economic agreements and military agreements are only the cooperation between the governments of the two countries, but further, the whole people of the two countries are the objects, communicating with each other in culture, recognizing each other and moving towards common goals.

### U.S. Secretary of State Declares Monitoring of British-Indian Relations; Public Statement on Martinique Issue Forthcoming

Washington, 27th (Havas) - When Secretary of State Hull met with the press today, a reporter asked him to comment on Wilkie's speech yesterday. The Secretary of State immediately replied that he had already expressed his views on the world situation and did not wish to add anything. Some Americans have new views almost every day on the current situation, especially on the relationship between Britain and India. The U.S. government is very concerned about this and is closely monitoring its development, but it is not convenient to express anything at this time. This is why those who do not bear the responsibility of promoting foreign policy can freely express their opinions and criticize the government, unlike those in charge who are subject to limitations. Since taking office as Secretary of State, I have always concentrated my efforts on promoting what I believe to be a far-sighted policy, and I will continue to do so with this spirit in the future. However, I anticipate that the number of people criticizing the government's foreign policy will decrease day by day, because the evolution of government policy will enable the people to better understand the position of the policy.

Washington, 27th (Havas) - Secretary of State Hull recently told the press that he hopes to make a public statement on the issue of French West Indian Martinique soon.

### Communicating Eastern and Western Culture: The Life of Matteo Ricci

Since the 16th and 17th centuries, the Catholic Jesuit Order has made significant contributions to Chinese academic fields. Among the most notable are Matteo Ricci's "Map of the Myriad Countries" and Ferdinand Verbiest's "Complete Map of the World." This newspaper has already published their achievements. Beyond preaching, each Jesuit devoted themselves wholeheartedly to learning, and their spirit of perseverance, moral cultivation, and diligent practice is worthy of emulation by future generations. Now, we present an article by Father Xu Zongze about Matteo Ricci, detailing Ricci's writings and teachings, his influence on scholars and officials, and his unwavering devotion to spreading the faith. His efforts are vividly etched in people's minds. At a time when the world is in turmoil, our admiration for our predecessors and our efforts to strive forward will benefit not only Catholics. Editor's note: Matteo Ricci, from Macerata, Italy, was born on October 6, 1552, the year that St. Francis Xavier died on Shangchuan Island. In his youth, he studied at the Jesuit school in his hometown for seven years. In 1568, he went to Rome to study law. On August 15, 1571, he joined the Jesuit novitiate. After completing his novitiate, he sought to preach in India. On May 18, 1577, he went to Lisbon, Portugal, and traveled by ship to India. On September 13, 1578, he arrived in Goa, at which time he had not yet been ordained. He was ordained a priest on July 26, 1580. Two years later, in April 1582, he went to Macau upon the order of Alessandro Valignano, the Visitor. He arrived on August 7 of that year, and on September 10 of the following year, he arrived in Zhaoqing with Father Michele Ruggieri.

After Ricci and Ruggieri arrived in Zhaoqing, they paid a visit to the prefect, Wang Pan, a native of Shanyin, Zhejiang, and a Jinshi graduate of the Jiaxu year. The prefect treated them with courtesy and invited them to stay, granting them land to build a residence. In December 1584, the first five-room building was completed, with the center serving as a church. Various Western books and maps of the world were displayed in the residence. Local people flocked to the priests' residence, and they were amazed by the Western-style buildings and the priests in their monastic robes. Ricci received them one by one with politeness and showed them ingenious self-ringing clocks, peculiar sundials, and magnificent chandeliers, and prisms, which they had never seen before, and they praised them without end.

While living in Zhaoqing, Matteo Ricci and Michele Ruggieri devoted themselves to learning the Chinese language. On November 27, 1584, Ruggieri published "The True Account of the Study of Heaven," which was the first publication printed by a Jesuit. In January 1587, Ruggieri once ventured deep into Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and then went to Guilin, Guangxi, finally returning to Zhaoqing on July 27 of the same year.

During these few years, Ruggieri traveled extensively in the five provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Huguang. He deeply understood that in order to reside in China and preach, the Roman Curia and the Chinese government needed to have formal envoys. Therefore, he decided to return to Europe to discuss the matter. He departed from Macau on December 22, 1588, and arrived in Rome on June 14, 1590. Unfortunately, Popes Sixtus V, Urban VII, and Innocent IX died successively within three years, and there was no time to negotiate the envoy issue. Ruggieri, old and weak, died at the Jesuit residence in Salerno, Italy, on May 11, 1607.

After Ruggieri returned to Europe, Matteo Ricci lived alone in Zhaoqing. In 1589, because the new governor, Liu Jiezai, wanted to take the priests' European-style residence to use as a memorial temple, Ricci left Zhaoqing on August 15 of that year and went to Shaozhou, where he chose a site outside the city to build a church.

Ricci's original intention in coming to China was to enter the capital and meet the emperor. In April 1595, Shi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, happened to be going to the capital to report on his duties, so Ricci traveled with him, crossing the Dayu Mountains, going up the river, arriving at Ganzhou, crossing the Eighteen Rapids, passing through Ji'an to Nanchang, taking the route through Poyang Lake, passing Anqing and Wuhu, and finally arriving in Nanjing on May 31 of that year.

Ricci encountered many difficulties when he first arrived in Nanjing, and on June 17, he returned to Nanchang. The journey was smooth, and in less than ten days, he reached Poyang Lake, arriving in Nanchang the day before the Feast of St. Peter in Chains, and stayed at the home of physician Wang Jilou.

As soon as Ricci arrived in Nanchang, his fame was already widespread, because his old friend Qu Taisu had already spread his name among the gods. Qu Taisu was the eldest son of Grand Minister Qu Wuyi. One of his daughters married the son of a certain prince of the imperial family in Nanchang. Qu spoke of Ricci before the prince, so Ricci got to know Prince Jian'an, and he had a long conversation with the prince on the way to make friends, and after returning, he wrote "On Friendship," which was published on October 13, 1596. Ricci also became friends with Vice Minister Lu Zhonghe, and after discussing for several days, he wrote "Western Methods of Memorization" for his three sons on the methods of reciting forward and backward. Zhang Huang, a famous scholar in Nanchang, whose courtesy name was Benqing, built a lecture hall on Donghu Lake, gathered students, and taught. In the Ren Chen year of Wanli, he presided over the Bailudong Academy. Hearing of Ricci's fame, he came specifically to visit, and they had a long conversation on philosophy, and they deeply understood each other.

Ricci had lived in Nanchang for three years, and he hoped that his wish to go to the capital to meet the emperor would be fulfilled soon. It happened that Wang Zhongming, Minister of Rites, had the convenience of going to the capital, so Ricci traveled with him. On June 25, 1598, he set off with fellow members Guo Jijing, Zhong Mingren, and You Wenhui, and arrived in Beijing in a few days. Zhao Kehuai, Governor of Suzhou, learned from Wang Zhongming that Matteo Ricci, who made the "Map of the Myriad Countries," was in Nanjing, and summoned him to the governor's office, which was stationed in Jurong. As soon as they met, they were as old friends. Ricci showed him an image of Jesus, the Savior of the World, for him to look at. Zhao said, "This image is not to be viewed lightly," so he set up a high platform with incense and candles in the place where he usually worshiped Heaven, and respectfully placed the holy image, bowing and paying his respects. Soon Ricci continued his journey, traveling along the Grand Canal, entering Shandong Province, and crossing the Yellow River. On September 7, 1598, he arrived in Beijing. At that time, relations between China and Japan were strained. Because Ricci was a foreigner, he was deeply suspected and could not stay for long, so he returned south, setting off on November 5 of that year and going straight to Zhenjiang, then traveling by land to Suzhou to visit Qu Taisu. On February 6, 1599, they arrived in Nanjing together and stayed at Chengen Temple.

This time when Ricci returned south, high-ranking officials came to visit him. Wang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, and Ye, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites, both sent cards to request an audience. Li Xinzai, a famous Confucian scholar of Neo-Confucianism, and Zhu Shilin, a censor of the Ministry of Rites, were particularly close to him. On May 24 of that year, Ricci purchased several houses and moved in to live there. In order to prepare for presenting , Ricci sent Guo Jijing to Macau to purchase Western goods. Guo arrived in Macau and obtained a small, exquisite clock, a large clock with a loud sound, a magnificent image of the Virgin Mary, an image of the Virgin Mary with Jesus and St. John, an image of Jesus, many prisms, and other strange objects. On November 1, 1599, they set off from Guangzhou, and in early 1600, they returned to Nanjing.

Having obtained the tribute goods, Ricci planned to go north again. On May 18, 1600, he set off and arrived in Jining. Liu Xintong, the Shandong Governor, had long heard of Ricci's name and came specifically to visit and view the tribute goods. Li Zhuowu was in Jining at that time, so he also came to visit, and they gathered and talked for days. Later, Ricci continued his journey to Linqing, Shandong, where the eunuch Ma Tang detained the tribute goods for six months. Suddenly, on January 8, 1601, the Wanli Emperor issued an edict to Ma Tang, ordering Ricci to quickly bring the tribute goods to the capital. Ma Tang was terrified and apologized to Ricci repeatedly, and also prepared eight fine horses and thirty servants to escort him to the capital, arriving on January 24.

After Ricci arrived in the capital, he submitted a memorial and presented the tribute goods. The Wanli Emperor, upon seeing the image of the Lord of Heaven, exclaimed in surprise, "This is a 'living Buddha'!" Seeing the image of the Virgin Mary, he was deeply moved and ordered it to be presented to the Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager was also amazed upon seeing the image and ordered it to be hung in the palace. The Emperor ordered that the image of Jesus be kept, and he particularly liked the two clocks.

The Ministry of Rites believed that according to precedent, the presentation of tribute by foreigners was a matter within its purview, but now the eunuch interfered with the tribute, and they were unwilling, so they submitted a memorial to the throne, many of them not agreeing with Ricci residing in the capital, so they housed Ricci in the Siyi Guan (Hall for the Accommodation of Tributary Envoys), and he could not move freely. In this situation, Ricci was nominally treated as a foreign guest, but in reality, it was no different from confinement, so he asked his acquaintances among the high-ranking officials to intercede, and finally, on May 18, 1601, he left the hall.

After Ricci left the Siyi Guan, his reputation soared, and officials and dignitaries came to pay their respects, and the road was never empty. Among the most prominent were Prime Minister Shen Jiaomen, Yiguan; and Prime Minister Ye Xianggao, who often came to visit, either consulting on Western learning or seeking knowledge of religious doctrine. The Wanli Emperor also repeatedly summoned Ricci to the inner court to repair the self-ringing clock and explain the Map of the Myriad Countries. Officials and commoners saw him entering and leaving the palace and suspected that he must be seeing the emperor frequently. Little did they know that the Wanli Emperor was indulging in pleasure and neglecting politics, and had not met with his ministers for twenty years.

Those who had deep friendships with Ricci in Beijing were Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizao. In 1600, Xu first met Ricci in Nanjing when he went to the capital for the examination. He became a Jinshi graduate in the Jia Chen year (1604). He returned south in the winter of that year, and went to Beijing again in 1605. Afterwards, he had many meetings with Ricci, discussing religious teachings and studying Western learning. He co-translated Euclid's "Elements" with Ricci, which was published in Beijing in 1607. In that year, his father died in Beijing, so he escorted the coffin back south. Li Zhizao was from Renhe. In the 26th year of Wanli, he ranked fifth in the metropolitan examination, and rose through the ranks to become Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Stud. He studied Western learning with Ricci and translated many books. In 1610, he became seriously ill and was baptized into the church by Ricci's hand.

Ricci's work in the ten years from his arrival in Beijing in 1601 until his death (1610) was focused on glorifying God and saving lives. In his spare time, he wrote books and taught. The rest of the time was spent teaching and discussing with scholars and officials, sometimes receiving guests and visiting friends all day long. Beijing was an important place, and thousands of officials and dignitaries came to Beijing every year to meet the emperor. And the officials and gentry who came to Beijing all wanted to see his demeanor because of Ricci's name. The years with the most visits to Ricci were during the examination period; 1604, 1607, and 1610, when scholars from fifteen provinces came to Beijing for the court examination, so these years were the years when Ricci met the most guests, and Ricci met them one by one, and also explained Western learning to them. Ricci was strict with himself and became exhausted from overwork, and eventually became ill.

When Li Zhizao heard of Ricci's illness, he immediately invited famous doctors in Beijing to treat him. At first, it was suspected to be a cold, but soon the illness became more serious. On May 8, he performed a general confession according to the sacred rules, confessing the sins of his life. On the 9th, he received the Holy Communion, and on the 10th, he received the Anointing of the Sick. The fellow members who were present were Xiong Sanba, Pang Diwo, and one Chinese member, all asking Ricci to bless them and give them his final words. He passed away peacefully at 7 p.m. on the 11th.

Li Zhizao, because he had not recovered from his illness, could not come in person, and wrote to Xiong and Pang, saying, "I will buy Phoebe zhennan wood to make a coffin for Ricci." He obtained the wood two days later. When Ricci died of illness, it was reported to the Ministry of Rites, and the emperor was shocked and grieved. The ministers of various departments, the scholars of the Hanlin Academy, and the gentry in Beijing all sent condolences and attended the funeral. The officials in the court discussed the location of the burial. Xiong Sanba, Pang Diwo, and others submitted a memorial, requesting that the memorial temple built by Eunuch Yang outside Fucheng Gate, which had been confiscated, be granted to Pang Diwo and others to inherit forever, to be used for building a tomb, and rebuilding a church, as a place to worship the Lord of Heaven and pray . On the feast day of All Saints, November 1611, Matteo Ricci was moved and buried there, and a memorial Mass was held. The Wanli Emperor sent a senior official to offer sacrifices. Wang Yinglin, the mayor of Shuntian, who was close to Matteo Ricci, wrote an epitaph for him.

On the day of Ricci's funeral, Li Zhizao had returned to Hangzhou to mourn his father; Xu Guangqi had returned to Beijing after his mourning period and personally attended the funeral. The priest at the time recorded that Xu cried the most sadly, because his respect and love for Ricci was no different from that for his parents. He loved his person and his possessions, and he also took back the rope that carried Ricci's coffin and treasured it as a treasure. After the funeral, people from inside and outside the church came to the tomb every day to pay their respects, so a priest was stationed at the burial site to return the courtesy.

As the saying goes, "The coffin is sealed and the evaluation is final." Matteo Ricci can truly be called the apostle of preaching in China and the founder of the foundation of preaching in China. Ricci came to China when China was pursuing a closed-door policy and not allowing foreigners to enter the interior. With perseverance and determination, Ricci went from Zhaoqing, Shaozhou, Nanchang, Nanjing, and finally to Beijing. At that time, the Chinese people were hostile to Catholicism, but Ricci was able to win the hearts of all parties with his kindness and sincerity. The people loved him, the scholars admired him, the officials approached him, and the emperor favored him. As for his preaching, he was not in a hurry to directly preach the doctrines of Catholicism, but only liked to discuss learning with people, using his subtle influence to make people feel converted without realizing it. He also loved to write books and defend the true faith. Those who read his books and were transformed by his virtue were countless. Therefore, his preaching achievements were remarkable. From his entry into Zhaoqing in 1583 to the year of his death, churches were built in Zhaoqing, Shaozhou, Nanchang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beijing. The number of Catholics in 1584 was only three in all of China, in 1585, it increased to nineteen, in 1586, there were forty, in 1596, there were one hundred, in 1603, there were about 500, in 1605, it increased to more than one thousand, and in 1608, there were more than two thousand, including many scholars and officials, such as Xu Guangqi, Li Zhizao, Yang Tingyun, Qu Taisu, and so on. Alas, Matteo Ricci can truly be called a great missionary.

### After Sugar Rationing: Market Supply Situation, Limited Quantity and Purchase Time; Emergency Meeting Held Yesterday to Crack Down on Manipulation

Although the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Office has repeatedly stated that there will be no shortage of sugar in this port and has clearly stated that the distribution of sugar for this month to various retail stores has been completed and that widespread sales have been checked and carried out starting Monday, according to the actual investigation results of the Datong reporter, the sugar supply situation is not yet smooth.

Southern Goods Stores Reluctant to Sell Sugar

Looking back at the phenomenon of sugar shortage in this port, it was still revealed in early October. Before about the 10th of this month, various southern goods stores had limited customers to one catty per person, until around the 12th and 13th, the limit was half a catty. Around the 20th, various retail stores refused to sell to customers, saying they were sold out. Until after the 22nd, when the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Office had completed the distribution of retail sugar, various southern goods stores began to resume sugar transactions, but with the excuse that the sugar they received was not enough, they all sold a small amount of pre-packaged sugar to customers starting at 10 a.m., priced at five cents per package, with a limit of one package per customer. After 10:10 a.m., the store clerks would refuse customers with the words "We will sell again at 10 a.m. tomorrow." According to the reporter's investigation over the past week, it has been learned that almost all sugar retail stores in this port are like this, and even a small number of stores even limit customers to buying other store goods worth more than five yuan before they can buy their five-cent package of sugar.

Limited Time and Limited Sales Volume

However, sugar retail stores in the Seymour Road Jing'an Temple Road area allow Westerners to buy half a pound between 10 a.m. and 10:30 a.m., because they think that Westerners need more sugar than Chinese people. These stores not only limit the time of day, but also limit the amount sold, which is absolutely 60 pounds per day. If this number is exceeded, they will stop selling even if it is not yet 10:30 a.m. As for the major companies on Nanjing Road, according to the reporter's investigation, except for the New World Company, which sells 50 pounds of sugar every morning (note that each person can buy one pound when the company sells, so only 50 people can enjoy this right every day), other companies such as Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun have all stopped selling long ago.

Hope the Authorities Participate in Rectification

According to general opinion, it is hoped that the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council will also pay attention to the sugar issue and hope that the authorities will participate in rectifying the sugar market to restore it to a normal state. It was previously rumored that the authorities also wanted to implement a certificate purchase system for sugar, but the result was not implemented. According to a certain party's request, the sugar stock in this port is enough for several months of use, so the general residents all hope that the authorities will notify the various depositors to register quickly so as to investigate the actual situation and thus solve the sugar problem in a short period of time.

Sugar Merchants' Business Office to Hold a Meeting

Also, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Office held a meeting yesterday (28th) afternoon to discuss the sugar in this port and decide on various emergency response measures. It is said that the lack of sugar in this port is purely due to the sabotage of various retail sugar stores. However, once the business office decides on a solution, these illegal stores will be severely cracked down on, and the special phenomenon of the sugar market in this port is also expected to disappear quickly.

### Final Redemption of Old Currency

The three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have two special cities, Shanghai and Nanjing. The Committee for the Final Comprehensive Exchange of Old Currency and the Consolidation of Old Currency has been ordered to hold a meeting, deliberate on the outline of the final exchange method of old currency, and announce its implementation. In addition to telegraphing the branch offices in Nanjing, Anqing, Wuhu, Nantong, Taixian, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Taicang, Bengbu, Changzhou, Changshu, Ningbo, and other places in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, 111 Sino-Japanese commercial banks in this city are specifically designated as entrusted agents for the exchange, in accordance with the announcement of the Ministry of Finance. The comprehensive exchange will be implemented for one month from November 1 to 30. Regarding the scope of the collection of old currency, according to the regulations of the outline of the final exchange method of old currency, it is limited to banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other three banks. Except for those banknotes with the place names of Shanghai, Xiamen, Hankou, and Guangzhou printed on the ticket, they shall not be exchanged.

### Careful Revision of Land Regulations

The issue of revising the land regulations of the Public Concession is being studied and discussed by the Public Concession Land Regulations Revision Committee in recent days. After the Land Regulations Revision Committee was organized and established in early September, it elected General Manager Okamoto and other four people to serve as members. To date, it has convened ten discussion meetings. The content of the discussion is related to the entire scope of the land regulations, which is complex and extensive, so the members are proceeding with a cautious attitude. The revised land regulations discussed and resolved by the committee will be submitted to the board of directors of the Public Works Department for review and then submitted to the consular corps. How the revised regulations will be adopted is still unknown, and is particularly watched by all parties.

### Speculative Merchants Arrested Four Times, Exceeding 600 People in Total

The English-language "The Times" reported that detectives from the Central District Patrol arrested 40 yarn and cloth brokers who were engaged in illegal transactions at the Cotton Cloth Industry Association on Shanxi Road on Monday morning. When they were arrested, traffic around the scene of the incident was interrupted, and after being detained in the Central Patrol Room, they were questioned again and ordered to add their fingerprints. It was also found that some of them had previously committed the same incident, which is the fourth time in the past two months. The total number of people arrested before and after the speculative merchants has exceeded 600.

### Public Concession Police Department to Review Citizen Certificates

According to news from the Public Concession Police Department, most of the criminals recently arrested by the patrol room do not have citizen certificates. The authorities believe that the heads of households may be deliberately concealing and not reporting their sub-households. According to the police authorities, the intention to evade receiving citizen certificates is obviously not to want people to know their daily lives, and they are harboring evil intentions. Therefore, those who evade receiving citizen certificates will be severely punished once they are found out, and the heads of households who do not report truthfully will be subject to the same punishment. Also, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, the police authorities will send police personnel to conduct a door-to-door review of the citizen certificates of residents in conjunction with various Lianbao in the near future.

### Street Vendors Fined for Violations

The Public Works Department announced that five food vendors on Tiantong Road were found to be using incorrect weighing instruments. After the Sanitation Department investigated , they were sent to the Special First Court for handling. As a result, one vendor was sentenced to three days of detention on the 23rd of this month, and the other four were each fined 30 yuan, and the weighing instruments were confiscated.

### Violating House Subletting Rules, the Authorities Decided to Punish Severely, Revoke Licenses and Fine 5,000 Yuan, Serious Cases Sent to Court for Investigation

The French Consul General Major promulgated house subletting rules, strictly prohibiting tenants from setting rents at will and charging small rents. The Municipal Council issued a supplementary statement yesterday, saying that second landlords in the French Concession who violate these rules will be fined up to 5,000 yuan, and their house subletting licenses will be revoked. In serious cases, they may also be sent to court for trial. The house subletting rules will be implemented from the first of next month. From then on, second landlords must report to the Finance Department of the Municipal Council in advance when subletting houses. All second landlords who raise rents without reason or take illegal actions such as closing windows and cutting off water and electricity to coerce third tenants will be subject to legal sanctions. It is also strictly forbidden to take small rents for renting out houses, and the subletting profit is limited to 20% of the rent, and subletting is only allowed after obtaining a license. The rent for each room in the house must be determined according to this rule based on its size. If any disputes arise in the renting of houses, the Municipal Council's Subletting Affairs Management Office may be invited to be responsible for promoting arbitration and mediation. The office will charge fees based on the amount of each rent, 5 yuan for those below 25 yuan, and 5 yuan for those above 25 yuan. The second landlord should indicate in the house the rent and house tax, license fee, water and electricity fees, repair fees, and other miscellaneous fees paid to the big landlord in the previous month, and the names of the third tenants and the rent they pay, as well as the room in which the second landlord lives, should also be indicated. Kitchens and bathrooms may not be used for other purposes. After the tenant has paid the deposit for renting the house, the second landlord is not allowed to unreasonably withhold the room to be rented for more than one month. The passages, walkways, and doors noted in the license must not be closed. If third tenants individually or collectively instigate the temple landlord to violate the above rules in order to benefit themselves, they shall also be dealt with by law. The grass in the south of the Yangtze River has not withered in the late autumn

### Colonel Watanabe Inspected the Nanshi District Yesterday

Colonel Watanabe of the Friendly Army, in order to understand the actual situation in Nanshi, inspected the entire Nanshi district yesterday afternoon, and then convened a meeting of the heads of various agencies in Nanshi at the Nanshi branch of the Special Affairs Agency at 1:00 p.m. to intensify the promotion of the Nanshi security issue. Those who attended included Wang Delin, director of the three police sub-bureaus in Nanshi, Chen Mengji, director of the Nanshi Tax Collection Office, and the heads of the various Fang Gongsuo (neighborhood public offices), and the director of the Nanshi Health Office, and more than ten other people. The meeting lasted for an hour before it was completed. There was a detailed discussion on repairing street lights to enhance the appearance of Nanshi.

### Haixu Tower: Xi Shi Holding Her Heart

— Notes

King Goujian of Yue offered Xi Shi to escape the tiger's mouth. After returning to his country, he recuperated and trained his troops, and conquered Wu after twenty years. His great achievements are recorded in history, but the King of Wu was infatuated with pleasure and lust, which also led to his demise.

Xi Shi was beautiful and weak, and had been suffering from stomach ailments for a long time. She often rubbed her chest with her hands, so she was called Xi Shi holding her heart. At that time, medicine was not yet developed, and doctors did not know the real reason for her holding her heart, so her illness was never cured.

Dr. Song Daren used examination therapy to find out the truth and then applied special medicines, so new and old stomach ailments were easily solved, making him the only modern expert in gastrointestinal diseases. The "Shanghai Gastrointestinal Hospital" opposite the Paramount Ballroom in Jing'an Temple was founded by Dr. Song. The telephone number is 36435.

### Air Raid Drills in the Two Concessions to be Held Again Soon; Residents Should Prepare for Early Next Month

This port's next air raid drill is likely to start on the ninth of next month. The duration of the drill is expected to be reduced to four days. According to information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, the upcoming air raid drill will be stricter and more complex than the first. Therefore, residents should prepare in advance.

Re-enactment Will Not Be Announced in Advance

It is understood that the Ten District Joint Defense has been forewarned by the police authorities that another blackout may be held in the short term, and it is not intended to announce it in advance. Residents must immediately and automatically implement all air defense measures upon hearing the air raid siren and must not be negligent, otherwise they will be subject to more severe penalties than last time.

Do Not Remove Blackout Equipment

Residents should not remove the blackout equipment purchased during the last drill, and should test it in advance. Furthermore, heads of households should go outside to inspect whether there are any light leaks when trying out the blackout. The satisfaction of all attempts depends on whether preparations can be made in advance.

No Changes to Street Lights and Station Lights

The iron covers on the street lamps along Nanjing Road, which were once removed after the first air raid drill, have now been completely reinstalled. When they were removed, some people mistakenly thought that the street lights would be completely dismantled, but this was not the case. At the same time, the station lights at various tram stops are also lit as usual, because the glass of the station lights is already amber-colored.

### Xin Fu Printing and Dyeing Factory Produces in Large Quantities After Moving to Shanghai

Equipped with New Machinery, Output of 3,000 Bolts of Cloth per Day

The name "Indanthrene Fabric" is known to virtually everyone in society, regardless of social class. This is because Indanthrene fabric is both elegant and inexpensive, and it comes in a variety of colors. There are bright colors for those who love fashion, and simple colors for those who love plainness. Therefore, men and women, young and old, all love to use it. If it is used for everyday wear, it is durable and the color never fades.

Wide Range of Uses, Durable to Washing

Some schools adopt it for uniforms, which is most suitable. Firstly, because young students' bodies are developing every day, there is often a big difference in size and length between the first and second half of the year. What they wear in the first half of the year is half a section shorter in the second half of the year. Wearing it makes them feel unfitting. Discarding it seems wasteful, and it feels a little pity. Fortunately, the price is cheap, so they don't pay much attention. If it were silk, the price difference would be much larger, which would naturally be a little upsetting. Secondly, because young students in school mostly like to move around and don't care much about clothes, dirt and dust are inevitably present, and they naturally need to be washed often to keep them clean. If it is silk, it is neither durable to washing, and once stained, it feels unsightly.

Two Kinds of Cloth, Indistinguishable

The Indanthrene fabrics that are often seen in newspapers are Chick Indanthrene and Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene. Chick Indanthrene is produced by Xin Fu Printing and Dyeing Factory, and Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene is produced by Xin Feng Printing and Dyeing Factory. These two kinds of Indanthrene fabric are truly indistinguishable. However, Chick Indanthrene seems to be more than one yard wider in size than Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene. If the quality is the same and the length is different, then Chick Indanthrene will naturally take advantage in actual sales. However, the market price of Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene is higher than that of Chick Indanthrene. This is because Chick Indanthrene has always been sold to other ports and does not pay attention to sales in this port. Later, when cotton was controlled, it had to be sold in this port. However, the ladies of this port are preconceived and only know Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene. They are somewhat unfamiliar with the name Chick Indanthrene. In addition to the verbal promotion of old customers who have already used it, the sales are therefore inferior to Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene. The business of easy sales naturally has a better price.

Sufficient Inventory of Pigments

Xin Fu Printing and Dyeing Factory is equipped with two domestic-made four-way aluminum furnaces and two British-made Peebles & Wilcox boilers. This type of boiler saves a lot of coal. The excess hot steam and used water can be reused, so there is no waste. Although a four-way type is completely copied from Peebles & Wilcox, its function is exactly the same. The pigment room stores a lot of pigments. It is said that these pigments are all top-quality. Although Germany is not coming now, it seems that there is a worry about future difficulties. However, the impact this time is not very big. Because during the previous European war, dyed and woven goods were sold everywhere, so the pigments spent were naturally very high. Now that dyed and woven goods cannot be sold everywhere, the pigments spent are limited. The previous high inventory is sufficient to use.

Sewing, Jointing, Degreasing, Sizing, Calendering

Sewing: The woven cloth is joined with a motor sewing machine. This sewing machine is different from that of Shengsui Company. The sewing place has no folded stems and is still very flat. Because if there are folded stems, there will be uneven shading in dyeing. There are only three or five such machines in Shanghai. Next is the singeing machine, which completely singes the cloth's lint. There are three fire sticks on the machine, which are as red as charcoal embers, with a temperature of over a thousand degrees. Next is the degreasing machine, which puts the sewn cloth on the machine to remove grease and other impurities, and then washes it clean before dyeing it. After dyeing, it is washed again to remove the discolored substance, so it becomes a permanent, non-fading color. Next is the sizing machine, which slightly sizes the dyed cloth, so the body of the cloth is stiff. Next is the calendering machine. After the sized cloth passes through this machine, it becomes very smooth and lovely.

New Machinery, Large-Scale Production

Next to it is another electric calendering machine. After passing through this calendering machine, it becomes Western Satin. So-called Western Satin has no silk quality at all. It is completely made of cloth. Then it enters the inspection room for inspection. Small defects are removed as second-grade goods. While picking, a Chick Indanthrene label is attached to it. Only then is it cut into bolts and packed up, and the work is complete. In addition to Chick products, the factory also produces a type of Fulido cloth that is now soliciting the second line of a couplet with a prize of $1,000. I wish you all more blessings and profits, more cloth and more benefits. It is said that the factory used to be located in Qingdao and moved to Shanghai after the "August 13th" Incident. The capital is a total of 12 million. All the machines are the latest models, and can produce 3,000 bolts of cloth per day. The interior is well-organized, and the workers can do their jobs. As for the cleanliness of the factory, it goes without saying.

### Civil Policeman Huang Zhongda Dies in Line of Duty During Drill; Funeral to be Held Today

Huang Zhongda, a member of the 50th Joint Defense of the McLand District of the French Concession, was assigned to firefighting work during a fire drill held at 3:25 PM on the 10th of this month. Upon receiving the news and rushing to put out the fire, he unfortunately slipped and fell at the entrance of the Lao Da Fang Scissor Shop at 71 Caishi Street. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for bandaging and discharged. On the 11th, he sought treatment from Chinese medicine doctor Shi Chunong, but it was ineffective. On the 17th, the wound became inflamed, and the Joint Defense Chief Tao Ran sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, the condition worsened, and he died at around 10:00 AM yesterday (the 27th). Upon hearing the bad news, the Joint Defense Chief immediately reported it to District Chief Liu Chenglin, who sent personnel to the hospital to handle the aftermath for the deceased civil policeman, and sent the body to the morgue. He requested the Special No. 2 Court to send an official for examination. At the same time, the owner of Yi Tai Secondhand Store, where Huang worked, reported the news, and his cousin Huang Zhongbao, who lived in Pudong, came to Shanghai to handle the funeral. At 10:00 AM yesterday (the 28th), after the judge examined the body, the District Chief sent the body to the Mainland Funeral Home. The funeral is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM today. At that time, all Joint Defense Chiefs and above baojia personnel in the district will go to the funeral home to hold a public memorial service. The French Police Department, the McLand Police Station, and the Public Concession Baojia Guidance Department will all send personnel to pay their respects to express their condolences and comfort the spirit of the deceased. Huang was 31 years old and a native of Taixing. He had worked at Yi Tai Secondhand Store at 71 Zhengjia Muqiao for many years and was very loyal, so he was favored by the owner. His only family in Shanghai is one cousin. His biological father, stepmother, wife, five siblings, and one child are all farmers in his hometown. His affairs are impoverished. As for the issue of compensation, the District Chief will report it to the French authorities for approval.

### Central Reserve Bank to Add Foreign Exchange Bureau; Feasible by Mid-Next Month

In view of the fact that Shanghai's trade with Nanyang is being considered for resumption, the Central Reserve Bank has decided to add a foreign exchange bureau to its Shanghai branch to facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese in Nanyang and promote the development of Sino-Japanese trade. The President will temporarily serve as the director of the bureau, and Zhuang Borong has been appointed as the deputy director of the bureau and Shen Juchen as the deputy director of the secretariat. Since active preparations began, it is heard that everything is about to be completed. Once the bank sends personnel to Japan to inspect the financial personnel and return to Shanghai, it will be feasible to add it by mid-next month.

### Children's Library Holds Car Presentation Ceremony

The main library is located at Dahua Commercial Center on Dahua Road and has a collection of over 10,000 books, providing free reading to children throughout the city. Recently, Mr. Chen Chunhua, a leader in the local yarn and flower industry, generously donated a mobile library car to serve street children. The library's board of directors has scheduled a car presentation ceremony to be held at the main library at 4:00 PM on November 1st, and has appointed Hu Zuyin, Huang Jingwan, Zhang Yuanfu, Ding Bingnan, and Sun Ruoyu to be responsible for the preparations.

### Letter

To the Editor:

We are writing to you concerning the news item in your newspaper on October 27th, titled "Sampan Sinks" during the gale of the previous day. The article stated: "Due to the sudden change in weather on the previous day, the wind on the Huangpu River was the strongest since the beginning of autumn. As a result, some ships stopped operating. Unexpectedly, in the morning, a sampan set out from the Qichang Pier in Pudong, fully loaded with salt vendors. While sailing to the center of the river, the sampan was overturned by the strong winds and immediately sank. By the time the rescue boat arrived, only one boatman and five passengers had been rescued, and the rest were not spared." Upon investigation, although the wind was strong for two days, there was no incident of a boat capsizing or drowning at the Shan Qichang Pier. Fearing confusion, we are writing to request that the editor-in-chief make a correction to reflect the facts. Sincerely, The Qichang Pier Public Ferry Company of Pudong. October 27th.

### A Record of Ms. Pang Nianxuan's Charity Exhibition of Chinese Painting

Ms. Pang Zuoyu is from a distinguished family in Wuxing, with a very rich family collection and a very clever talent for painting. She is also very young and has studied with Zheng Manqing. She surpasses her teacher and pioneers her own path. This time, to commemorate the anniversary of her late mother's death and to embody her mother's charitable spirit, she is holding a charity exhibition of Chinese painting for educational grants to help underprivileged young people out of love for the old and the young. This virtue of "inexhaustible filial piety, forever bestowing on her kind" is worthy of admiration. The venue is at the Daxin Painting Hall, and the dates are from October 26th to October 1st. There are more than 300 works. A portrait of Mrs. Pang Sr. is hung in the venue, showing her kind and benevolent appearance. It is surrounded by fresh flowers, and below is the layout of the charity exhibition's preparation office, explaining the purpose of the Nianxuan Charity Exhibition of Chinese Painting, with all the proceeds being used for educational grants. Ms. Pang's works are truly dazzling and beautiful. Whether they are small or large, they can all express a full sense of beauty. The vigorous use of the brush makes one suspect that they are not the work of a woman, if not for her beautiful appearance. No wonder the old gentleman Qian Mingshan wanted to inscribe "Extremely Alive to This, Sweat Stains My Collar." Many works have inscriptions by famous artists, such as Gong Yu, Wu Chang, Shou Tie, Ai Nong, Fen Weng, Bai Jiao, and Xue Ni. Speaking of Ms. Pang's style, it is not limited to one school or faction. Her elegance is close to Yun Nantian, her purity is similar to Hua Xinluo, her uprightness seems to be Chen Baiyang, her naivety is almost Li Futang, and her meticulousness can be traced back to Wang Ruoshui of the Yuan Dynasty and Lu Zhenting of the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, Ms. Pang's works are rare among modern female painters. It is appropriate that the price of paper in Luoyang is expensive, and they are being snatched up.

### Sino-Soviet Volleyball Charity Tournament Concludes; Xingren Wins Men's Championship; Vita-Rich Wins Women's Championship

The final act of the Vita-Rich Cup Sino-Soviet Volleyball Charity Tournament, the final between Xingren and the Russian community, was held at the YMCA gymnasium in Baxianqiao starting at 7:30 last night. No fewer than four or five hundred Chinese and Russian people went to watch the game. The first act was the women's Vita-Rich team playing against the Russian women's team for the second time. At the sound of referee Liu Shangsheng's order, the two female armies began to engage. The Vita-Rich team's performance was outstanding. Wang Weizhen played with exceptional skill, complementing each other perfectly. The Russian women were at a loss. Vita-Rich defeated the Russian women again and won the women's championship. Then, the men's Xingren team and the Russian team entered the arena. The two teams had each won once before. Last night was the final, so all the players were in high spirits. Referee Liang Zhaoan blew the whistle to start the game. The Russian community scored the first point, and Xingren quickly scored three points. They then tied the score 4-4. Xingren's Tan Yongzhan and Yuan Bingqiu's spikes were fierce. The Russian community also resisted with all their might. The scores were extremely close. Xingren finally relied on their final efforts to narrowly win the first game 21-19. In the second game, the Russian community once took the lead, but unfortunately lost due to poor cooperation, especially losing 20-22. In the final game, Xingren fought more and more bravely, while the Russian community committed more and more fouls. Xingren won again 21-16. In conclusion, 3-0, Xingren defeated the Russian community. As a result of the entire tournament, Xingren also overcame the Russian community 2-1 and won the championship. Midway through the game, Qu Yaokang hosted an auction of charity balls, which the great philanthropist Lin Jiuru bought for $2,000, and his enthusiasm was admirable. After the game, Jiang Guofang awarded the prizes on the spot and the event ended. Also, all the income from tickets and charity balls will be used for the expenses of the Women's Youth Nursery and the Russian community's charitable organizations. The game results from last night are as follows:

Xingren 21-19 22-20 21-16 Russian Community (Men)

Vita-Rich 21-7 18-21 21-19 Russian Community (Women)

### Chinese Stocks Surge; Cultural Stocks Reach Pinnacle

Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw mixed fortunes, with rises and falls varying. Investment targets were not widespread, with investors selectively pursuing stocks they had confidence in. Cultural stocks, after a buying spree was reignited the day before, saw increasing news of capital increases and a lack of sellers. Amidst consistent buying, they soared to unprecedented highs. Commercial Press flew up to $395, with a noon price of $390, a surge of $15. China Book Company reached $305, soaring by $30. Yongxiang Printing was at $24.25, up 25 cents. World Book reached $1034, up $1. Kaili Department Store was even more favored by investors, with the price soaring to $20. Wing On Company was slightly lower by $1. Sincere and National Goods Company each edged up by a small amount. In the textile industry, only American Rayon and Velvet rose by 15 cents. Great China Weaving was at $13.50, flat, with no other changes. For example, Hongsheng Weaving was at $13.50 and Shanghai Cotton Weaving was at $13.25, each down by a small amount. Wing On Textiles was down by 25 cents. News of American Asia Silk Factory's capital increase is intensifying. In the new pharmaceutical industry, only Sino-French Pharmacy was down $1, with most others prospering. New Asia and Minyi rose by 50 cents to $1. Sino-Western Pharmacy was around $445. Star Perfume rose by $5. Dahua Matches saw a high price of $251.50. In public utilities, Zhabei Water & Electricity was slightly lower by 50 cents. China General Edison saw little change. China Coal Mining was at $380-390. Great Light Dyeing & Weaving, scheduled to officially open next week, rose to $14.50 with little supply. Gongxin Radio Equipment stocks were again sought after in the market, rising to a transaction price of $16.50. Xinhua Lacquer rose to $14.50 with actual owners. It appears that people's hearts are gradually being invigorated, and trading is quite active. Furthermore, due to the increasing number of operators, settlements are busy. The industry has decided to suspend trading every Saturday. The market price list is recorded below.

### Government Bonds Plummet; Momentum Like a Broken Bamboo

The gray market for government bonds saw a decline yesterday. Selling pressure was so acute that the market had no twists or turns, dropping straight down. E bonds broke the $60 mark again, and even A bonds once retreated into the $60 range. The momentum was like a broken bamboo. The previous rise has resulted in today's fall. While the silver interest rate is temporarily unable to shake off its tight condition due to the bill-of-exchange period, goods are unusually congested, and all groups are extremely bloated. Borrowing to short is also very easy. Public sentiment is volatile, gradually causing panic. According to popular observation, because the low of $2.50 has already been broken, the $60 market price may also be difficult to maintain. Although this is speculative, the downward trend is indeed just beginning. It is not yet time for bulls to enter. After the market closed, news of new issues coming to market spread like wildfire. The market price ultimately rebounded by $1.90 to $2.50 across the board, with total transactions of $3,670,000. A concise table is listed below.

### Ornaments Gain; Military Scrip Rises Slightly

The listed price for ornamental gold at jewelry stores in this city was initially $2,500 per tael, but by 10 AM, it rose by $50 to $2,450 (purchases were reduced by about $300). The inter-dealer price fell to around $2,200, slightly lower by $20, calculated at $2,230. Subsequently, amid selling pressure, it fell by another $35 to $2,195. Then, because gold shops and certain groups limited purchases, and because the Joint Reserve Bank notes rose from $4.50 to $6.50, the market perked up, and the price also rebounded. At noon, it reached a high of $2,225, a decrease of $25 compared to the previous day, with a difference of $35. Transactions were light. Ornamental silver was still listed at $14 per tael, with inter-dealer prices at $12.68, also showing weakness.

The interest rate for interbank lending at the Bankers Association was 14 cents, unchanged, but the money supply is gradually tightening.

Military scrip suddenly rose, due to end-of-month demand and numerous small settlements. The highest inter-dealer price was $5.559, and the final price was $5.5568, a rebound of half a cent. Therefore, the purchase price at silver shops and small money changers was still $5.56, and some required $5.565.

### Influx of Cotton Cloth into This Street; Extremely Prosperous

Factory Cloth: The market was flat yesterday morning, and continued to be firm in the afternoon. White goods, both coarse and fine cloth, were in short supply, and merchants on this street were eager to purchase.

Brief Discussions

### People and Matters

— Wu Dai

"Too many cooks spoil the broth, too many matters overwhelm the man." The former refers to groups and organizations, while the latter refers to individuals. Regarding the former, there is a story about a monk and water, saying, "One monk carries water to drink, two monks haul water to drink, three monks have no water to drink." This means that too many people lead to chaos; you watch me, I wait for you to do it, and no one takes responsibility. This is something any healthy organization should avoid. Regarding the latter, it naturally means that one person holds multiple positions, wanting to do everything and unwilling to give up anything, but ultimately cannot do anything, ending up with nothing accomplished. Is this not clear evidence of "too many matters overwhelming the man"?

"Mismanaging affairs because of people, appointing people based on affairs." This is another important question in the complex relationship between people and matters. It is clear that unless it is to accommodate a particularly outstanding talent, under normal circumstances, mismanaging affairs because of people is the most unwise action. Appointing people based on affairs is the personnel principle that healthy organizations should implement.

It is said that Yuan Shikai once said something heartbreaking about Chinese society: "People exceed affairs, affairs exceed people." If we think calmly and carefully, we can understand that these two contradictory situations do indeed exist in parallel in Chinese society. In an organization, on the one hand, the number of personal connections placed is too numerous to count, leading to "people exceeding affairs"; on the other hand, among these well-placed personal connections, the majority may be useless, without a truly capable person, so "affairs exceed people." The "people" in "affairs exceeding people" naturally refers to those with the ability to handle affairs.

### Feng Shui Master

— Zi Xin

This time, returning to my hometown was not purely to wash away the dust and dirt that had stained my eyes and ears, but to complete another important task: burying my father.

Previously, my uncle had said in a letter to me: Please hire a feng shui master to look at the geomancy. Although I don't believe in things like feng shui, my uncle was indeed acting out of good intentions, so it seemed inappropriate to refuse.

Therefore, upon arriving in my hometown, seeing that feng shui master at my uncle's house did not surprise me. I had known about it beforehand. Giving him a detailed account, I saw from his face covered in dust and wrinkles that he was a hard-working and elderly man. From the dirtiness of his half-closed eyes and the worn-out jacket covering his bony frame, I deeply felt that he had worked hard his whole life in vain and would not improve the geomancy of his ancestral grave because he was familiar with feng shui. I felt somewhat sorry for him, "Working hard for others, busy for others."

"Yes, yes, I've been waiting for your arrival. Now, ha ha ha, now, very good, ha ha ha, very good!" He said many complimentary words with a string of smiling faces, then gestured and spoke at length about many things I had never heard of and did not understand. Immediately, he turned the topic to a seemingly extremely serious issue of compatibility. He said: "Your late father and mother were buried with the gold well at the hour of Chu Wu, mmm, but your late father, you see, was chosen to be buried at the hour of Zheng Gui, so, mmm, the clash between Zi and Wu is quite severe. When lowering the gold well, except for your own relatives, regardless of age or gender, anyone born in the year of the Rat is... is... mmm, must stay far away!"

He shook his head and spoke eloquently. The last sentence was truly stern and resolute. Moreover, he made an irreversible downward splitting gesture with his right hand.

His actions, no, his words, made my aunt anxious. All the steps for my father's burial were entrusted to my uncle, who was kind enough to help out while I was far away in Shanghai. It was expected that he would have to spend time and effort. My aunt naturally worried that my elderly uncle would be exhausted, but she also felt sorry for her nephew's helplessness and never stopped him. However, the clash between Zi and Wu further concerned the fate, even the life, of my uncle, who was born in the year of the Rat. She couldn't help but feel that she had been threatened invisibly and was uneasy.

Looking at my uncle's expression, he was also quite embarrassed, in a dilemma. Naturally, on the one hand, was his companion of decades, and on the other hand was his close nephew. His hesitant attitude quickly showed on his face. This clever feng shui master seemed to see through it and immediately revised, no, simply overturned his words just now:

"Actually, although it is said that there is a clash between Zi and Wu, there is no need to take it so seriously. Just turn your head away when lowering the gold well, mmm, just turn your back to the gold well, it's okay, ha ha ha, it's no..."

The next day, our group arrived at the cemetery. According to the rules, determined by the feng shui master's calculations, my father had to be buried at the hour of Zheng Wu. Before that, my uncle was supposed to be buried first. But, unfortunately, the workers dug the wrong spot. After the clerk investigated and found out that they should have dug in the previous row, he immediately ordered them to stop and told them to re-dig in the previous row. Although it was said, "immediately," it naturally referred to an hour or two. So, the feng shui master walked over to me and suggested:

"How about letting your late father be buried first? Mmm?" Afraid that I would disagree, he glanced at me and emphasized earnestly, "Anyway, it's all at the hour of Wu, before and after are clearly the same; moreover, your late father and your late uncle and aunt are also..."

I couldn't help but laugh. The feng shui master was indeed good at "reading the wind and steering the boat." He could change the tone from "must stay far away" to "just turn your head away when lowering the gold well," and could turn "Chu Wu hour" and "Zheng Wu hour" into "before and after are clearly the same." Isn't it appropriate? "Your late father and your late uncle and aunt are..." are family!

Catering to the psychology of the client is nothing more than for his own livelihood and is not surprising. However, knowing that the feng shui master's plans for the dead are just to deceive the living, and not exposing him, allowing him to exist and swindle money, that seems to be the strange thing, doesn't it?

### We Eat Water

— He Kai

Probably nine out of ten people would say that we drink a lot of water, but eating water is simply impossible! But in reality, we do eat water, and not in small amounts.

The strange thing is that water exists in everything we eat. Even in seemingly dry rice and oatmeal, there is water. We generally believe that there is definitely no moisture in them, but it does exist, about 14 percent. Even if we eat these foods dry (luckily we don't have to), we would still absorb about 14 pounds, or a gallon and a half, of water for every hundred pounds of food we eat.

We only need to think about the various liquids added to make these foods palatable to understand that the amount of water will increase tenfold to fifteenfold, almost turning the entire thing into water.

The amount of water contained in carrots is surprisingly high, reaching 90 percent of the quantity, and potatoes are not far behind. Because if you buy a hundred pounds of potatoes, you are really only buying sixteen pounds, and the other eighty-four pounds are water. If you also include the potato skins and attached soil, the actual potatoes you get are probably even less.

The amount of water contained in vegetables is also significant. Cabbage contains 93 percent water, beets contain 83 percent water, and cucumbers, as you can guess from their shape, contain 96 percent water.

For every pound of meat we eat, we eat at least half a pound of water at the same time. If the meat is taken from a young animal, this amount will increase. If we eat poultry, it will even increase to 75 percent.

Since fish grow in water, the amount of water they contain is naturally very high. Some types of fish contain as much as 85 percent water. Sole fish prides itself on having this amount, but salmon is satisfied with 75 percent.

In addition to the water we drink, since we "eat" so much water, it is not surprising that our bodies contain so much water. Various experiments have proven that the human body contains about 72 percent water.

### In the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

The next day, the original plan to call a doctor was naturally abandoned. After the meal, Huang Long hadn't forgotten Madam Ye's instructions. He slept during the day and patrolled at night, snoring in the back room. Weicheng held a copy of "Historical Records" in his hand, flipped through it, but couldn't concentrate on reading it. He also felt that his hands, exposed outside his sleeves, were a little cold, so he rolled up the book, stuffed it into his sleeve, and put his hands in his sleeves as well, his left hand in his right sleeve and his right hand in his left sleeve. He stood up and walked to the outside of Cuizhen's room, first making his footsteps louder, and asked, "Sister Cuizhen, are you not asleep?" Cuizhen hurriedly greeted him, laughing, "I'm really not used to sleeping during the day." Weicheng, without waiting for Cuizhen to invite him in, walked in and laughed, "Yes, that's right." This room was where Fei Changhe had people take Cuizhen after abducting her here, so Weicheng sat down and said, "Sister Cuizhen, living in this room must be shocking to you." Cuizhen leaned against the bed rail and replied, "I always think of things from the past as things from a previous life and don't think about them too much. Brother Cheng, are you cold? Have you put on your flannel shirt?" Weicheng said, "I haven't put it on. I don't feel cold." He took his hands out of his sleeves, and the copy of "Historical Records" also came out, so he put it on the table and rubbed his hands.

Weicheng asked Cuizhen to sit down, and Cuizhen sat on the edge of the bed. He laughed and said, "I'm talking out of turn. Are you angry?" Cuizhen said, "I would never be angry with Brother Cheng." Weicheng said, "Now that there's no one else around, I have a question from the bottom of my heart that I want to ask Sister Cuizhen. It's what I said to mother last night about making Sister Cuizhen our family's daughter-in-law. Sister Cuizhen didn't agree. Besides being disabled, is there any other reason?" Cuizhen seemed to think for a moment, her face didn't flush, and she laughed, "Brother Cheng, why don't you ask the real daughter-in-law of the Ye family and ask me? I've thought about it a thousand times and ten thousand times. Only Miss Chen Guofang is worthy; no one else is a good match. Brother Cheng, these are also words from the bottom of my heart. I don't know how to lie at all. If you do as I say, I'll never regret it in my life." Cuizhen's voice was a little choked up in the second half of her speech, but she still managed to laugh a little.

### Armored Car

— Zhang Qiao

The bandits in America are truly elusive and highly skilled. The banking community fears them like snakes and scorpions, so the defenses are naturally formidable. The armored car in the picture is used by the Los Angeles bank to transport money. The streamlined body also has a turret where bodyguards can operate machine guns. In case of a violent robbery, the bulletproof windows have gun ports. There are also two gun ports on the turret, specifically to prevent thugs from rushing to the car door. The exterior of the car is made entirely of special soft steel that can absorb bullets, so that innocent pedestrians will not be injured by bullets ricocheting off the car. The middle has two inches of insulation, and the interior is made of armored steel. The armored car has three compartments: the driver, valuables, and the turret. Each compartment has a telephone for communication. The armored glass on the windows is one and a half inches thick.

### Value

— Lan Ke

The world is complex, and the constant choices we make about value reveal the differences between people. Living in the same place, living in the same circle, how do you know the difference between him and her?

People must live, and living requires pursuit. Some want to become famous through scholarship, lecturing and writing; some want to flaunt fashion and gain the admiration of others; some devote themselves to art or poetry, hoping to leave a lasting legacy for eternity; while for some, the only goal at a certain time is a woman.

Can you give them each an evaluation? I am too lazy to answer. I silently watch this human drama: infinitely changing. Because persistence requires strength to maintain, it is like rowing against the current. Adaptability, on the other hand, is extremely convenient, but it does not mean that it will be smooth sailing.

### The Horn of the Heart

— Huang Wenjin

Loud and far-reaching, at midnight, a strand of horn sounds echoes in the darkness.

It is the transcendent and tragic tone, the ardent cry of life. At the beginning, it seems that the frozen flow of a cold pool is gently trickling; soon, it seems to be attacked by a storm and suddenly roars like the tide of an angry sea.

Higher, higher, like the charge of cavalry, like the clanging of iron, like soaring flames, like late autumn rain and thunder, the horn of the heart madly increases.

What grief and indignation do you have, horn of midnight?

Yes, your tone will have an exhausted period, yes, don't be sad because of this! When your remaining sounds gradually fade, the surrounding echoes will reverberate and strengthen, strengthen, strengthen the echoes reflecting the echoes, it will continue forever in the darkness.

The sorrows of life, the bitterness of darkness, the joys and sorrows of life and death, the bitterness and pleasure of wealth and poverty, all of this you should use that rugged heat to ruthlessly destroy: then, play the triumphal tune, blow in new, true hope.

Blow, impassioned horn, blow through the hazy darkness, break through that ancient era, quickly bring new light to the desolate human world!

(This article is based on Tennyson's poem.)

### The Intermediary of Goods

— Gang Zhi

(1) Four Conditions

The intermediary of goods trading is commonly called a "runner" in Shanghai, or a broker, but the former is employed, while the latter is not and only takes commissions. This is the slight difference between a runner and a broker. Their nature is exactly the same.

To be a runner or a broker, you don't need to be proficient in writing or have profound knowledge, because the object of their profession is to buy and sell goods, so these are not used much. The necessary conditions for them are: First, good eloquence. Situated between the buyer and seller, both parties must be taken care of. Losing either party will result in a failed transaction, and to make the buyer willing to buy and the seller willing to sell, it all depends on your silver tongue. Second, social skills. Runners and brokers who are able to "make the rounds" and please everyone rely on knowing many people. And to know many people and have close relationships, social skills are essential. Otherwise, even with good eloquence, it is difficult to get started, and the runner's job cannot be "successful." Third, tactics - both soft and hard. The commercial arena is like a battlefield. Being weak makes it easy to suffer losses; tactics must be firm. But being only firm and not soft will not work either, so you must use both hard and soft tactics, judging the situation and using the right approach to avoid suffering losses. Fourth, a good appearance. In today's society, most people's vision is short-sighted, as the saying goes, "judging people by their clothes, not by their character." This is especially true for runners. If you dress shabbily, you are often treated with contempt, and people may even think that you are unreliable, so appearance cannot be ignored.

From the above four points, it can be seen that being a runner is not easy, so they often say with a somewhat arrogant tone: "Being a broker is something that gods and tigers can do."
