### Invoices Must Be Issued for Price-Controlled Goods to Prevent Price Gouging

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently tightened its crackdown on profiteering and ordered all shops or individuals to issue invoices when selling price-controlled goods. Business sources claim that this move by the Municipal Council will make it difficult for profiteers and brokers to gouge prices. This kind of black market trading is the main cause of economic ills in the city because it is handled repeatedly and the price is raised higher and higher. Furthermore, it will be easier to find out if stores buy goods above the limited price, since they did not need to issue invoices before. Considering the above-mentioned points, it can be seen that the Council's order to issue invoices is one of the most important actions in recent months.

### New Methods for Rice Cultivation - Professor Xu Tianxi of the YMCA Agricultural Lecture Series Speaks

Rice and sweet potatoes occupy an important position in the people's diet, which is undeniable. What contributions has science made to these two crops? In other words, how can the new agriculture of science increase yields and improve quality? I will first talk about the experience of farmers and then discuss the areas where science should improve.

Seed Selection: Our farmers have always only known how to save seeds, but not how to select them. The old farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are more advanced in their rice planting methods. They may not conform to scientific principles, but they have rich experience. For example, they use wind power to remove light seeds and keep the heavy ones, as the heavy ones are strong seeds. Alternatively, they use tools for selection, with the same intention.

Sowing: In terms of general methods for planting rice across the country, it is divided into direct sowing and transplanting. Provinces like Guangdong and Guangxi use direct sowing, while Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces all use transplanting. Direct sowing means that the seeds are sown, the soil is loosened, and after germination, they are allowed to grow directly. Transplanting involves soaking the seeds, allowing them to germinate, sowing them in seedbeds, and then transplanting them into the fields after they have grown. In the South, there is also planting in dry soil without irrigation, called dry seedlings.

Transplanting Methods: Generally divided into "large seedlings" and "small seedlings." "Large seedlings" means transplanting after the seedlings have grown larger. "Small seedlings" means inserting the seedlings into the soil together with the soil. The above methods have advantages and disadvantages, and it is best to adapt to local conditions. Although our farmers adhere to old methods, they have rich experience. Science has not yet made any better contributions. As for irrigation, the Yangtze River basin, such as the Taihu Lake area, Poyang Lake area, and Dongting Lake area, has abundant water sources and many eyes, which can be said to be naturally endowed. Therefore, rice production is very abundant. In many provinces, water conservancy is not developed. In mountainous areas, floods occur during the rainy season, with too much water. During droughts, there is no rain for months, and farmers truly rely on the heavens for their livelihood. The most important factor in rice harvest is fertilizer. If fertilizer is sufficient, the production of two years can supply food for three years; otherwise, the production of three years is not enough for two years. Suitable fertilizers for rice include river mud, compost, manure, green manure, soybean cake, grass and wood ash, human waste fertilizer, bone meal, rice husks, etc. Chemical fertilizers are not yet widespread. In short, if fertilizer is insufficient, production is insufficient.

Below is a brief description of how to improve rice cultivation. Seed Production: Good rice seeds not only produce high yields but also have good quality. Rice is divided into indica rice and glutinous rice. Indica rice is the rice eaten for daily meals, while glutinous rice is commonly used for brewing wine and making other desserts. The rice varieties produced in Guangxi Province can be divided into over a thousand types. Nationwide, it can be divided into over ten thousand types. This is because the provinces have different climates and soils, just like the differences in local dialects. For rice seed selection, the Japanese use a salt water test method, selecting the ones that sink to the bottom. There is also a mixed method, which involves observing the firmness of the panicles, branches, leaves, and stems of the rice when it is ripe, as well as the thickness and density of the seeds, etc., selecting the best ones for seed. It is essential to distinguish clearly. According to research by agricultural organizations, proper seed selection can increase yields by 10% to 20%. Common people say that there are three types of rice: early, mid, and late season. In reality, there is no such thing as early or late season seeds. It is only necessary to select superior seeds, which can be used for early, mid, and late seasons. In this era of rice shortage, we only need to pay attention to rice production and not be too concerned about quality. To increase production, it is necessary to plant more indica rice, reduce planting glutinous rice, and prohibit the use of rice for brewing wine.

### After Restrictions on Car Traffic, Road Traffic Becomes More Difficult - Pedestrians and Vehicles Disobey Traffic Rules

Although cars have largely stopped running due to a lack of gasoline, road traffic is becoming increasingly difficult. The reason for this is that pedestrians walking in the road or crossing the road are careless, so the victims of accidents are mostly these people. In addition, drivers of bicycles, rickshaws, small carts, flatbed carts, and "tiger carts" often disobey the rules when driving in the road or turn suddenly without signaling in advance, which is also a cause of traffic difficulties. Strict orders have now been issued for patrol police on the roads to pay attention to the implementation of the traffic regulations. Violators will first be warned, and if they do not listen, they will be taken to the police station for punishment.

### Yesterday's Friendly Football Match - Longwei United Army Loses by One Goal - Nie Zhongcheng Wins 5 to 4

The Longwei United Army, formed by the Xiaolong and Xiaowei teams, played a friendly match against the strong Nie Zhongcheng team of the municipal public schools at the Jingzhou Road Stadium yesterday to test their skills. The Nie Zhongcheng team players were all over six feet tall, and the United Army was at a disadvantage in terms of physique. Furthermore, they had not experienced such a large match before and were inevitably nervous. It was also their first time trying out their new football shoes, so they were completely at a loss. They lost 3-0 in the first half. In the second half, the United Army showed great courage and actively counterattacked. Yin Qingbing first scored a penalty kick. Wang Futing and Chen Zexin then scored two goals in succession, tying the score at 3-3. Later, the United Army conceded another goal, and Zhang Jinsheng tied the score again at 4-4. In the last two minutes, they unfortunately conceded another goal. The United Army unfortunately lost by one goal, 4-5.

### "Sha Chi" Highest Price Reached - 20,000 Yuan

The cash "sha chi" (speculation market) plummeted after a sudden surge. Many brokers at the 20,000 yuan price limit. Japanese military scrip returned to within 7 yuan, and cash houses and silversmiths were still selling real goods, fueling speculative sentiment. The price eventually fell near the 18,000 yuan mark. The market sentiment shifted from bearish to weary. The morning began with the upward momentum from the afternoon before, with the highest price reaching 20,000 yuan. However, it immediately declined. The official opening price was 19,700 yuan, 1,120 yuan higher than the previous afternoon's closing price, and 200 yuan higher than the off-exchange price. Subsequently, amidst chaotic supply and demand struggles, the market price fluctuated rapidly. Xieji, Chengji, Hefaji, and silversmiths sold aggressively down to 19,500 yuan. Shen Da, Yongjin, Yuan, and retail investors bought, pushing the price back up to 19,700 yuan. Upon hearing that military scrip had stopped rising and was declining, selling pressure erupted. Yongfengyu, Dachen, Defu, Yimao, Yongsheng, Shen Da, Yong, and silversmiths all began selling aggressively. Overextended speculators also rushed to sell, causing the price to plummet by 1,500 yuan, falling below 19,000 yuan. The price fell even faster, reaching a low of 18,200 yuan. Near noon, the Qian Dui Ye (money exchange industry), Xieji Securities, and other firms aggressively bought, pushing the price up to 18,450 yuan. However, it ultimately faltered. The noon closing price was 18,280 yuan, 300 yuan lower than the previous afternoon's closing price, and 1,220 yuan lower than the afternoon off-exchange price. After the close, short sellers covered their positions, pushing the price up to 18,500 yuan. There was a difference of 1,600 yuan in half a day. The transaction volume was not robust. The price of jewelry gold was uniformly lowered by 150 yuan by Daxin and other firms to 1,900 yuan per tael (purchases were reduced by 200 yuan). Bar silver was quoted at 20 yuan, and black market silver at 18-19 yuan. Silver coins were quoted at 11.5 yuan each.

Foreign Exchange Market Conditions: The British pound and the US dollar rose slightly by 10 yuan. The former was 410 yuan, and the latter was 420 yuan. US dollar notes rose again to 21.25 yuan. Hong Kong notes remained at 3.3 yuan, with large notes falling by a small 0.1 yuan. Military scrip initially rose to 7.4 yuan, then fell back to 6.8 yuan, and finally settled at 6.9 yuan, 0.3 yuan lower than the previous day.

### Government Bonds - Bulls and Bears Await Developments

The over-the-counter market for government bonds was even quieter yesterday. Although there were many buyers and sellers, there were no large transactions. Market prices were generally firm. Both bulls and bears were mostly on the sidelines, awaiting future developments. Because trading in chits, military scrip, and cotton yarn was more active at present, most investors abandoned government bonds in favor of those other assets, resulting in thin trading volume. The trend was relatively stable. Buyers included Tongli, Xiexingyuan, Hu Heji, Xie Kang, and Xinhua. Sellers included Tongxing, Lianhe, Dazhong, Wuhe, Yichang, and Tongyi. The transaction volume was only two to three hundred thousand yuan. A concise table is provided below:

Most foreign shares rose slightly. Jardine Spinning closed at 25.25 yuan and 25.5 yuan. Sino-British closed at 7.1 yuan. Asia Navigation closed at 8.1 yuan. Yeguang rose from 17.2 yuan to 17.5 yuan. Paper closed at 1.3 yuan. Telephone closed at 25.5 yuan. All rose slightly by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. Shanghai Wool closed at 6.2 yuan. Yangzi closed at 11 yuan. These fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan.

Yingzha Hua closed at 19 yuan. Rubber closed at 14 yuan. There were buyers for all of these.

### Dried Lily Flowers See High Prices Again

The supply of dried lily flowers has been scarce recently, so merchants are very interested in purchasing. The opening price was higher than the retail price. Yesterday, the San Kang brand opened at 580 yuan, and the Hong Zi brand opened at 540 yuan. These were unprecedentedly high prices.

### More Crowded to Buy Foreign Rice

Yesterday, the distribution of foreign rice became even more crowded. Rice hawkers selling domestic rice also lowered their prices accordingly. In the central district, the price was only 40 yuan per dou (unit of volume). In the French Concession, the price was only 35 yuan per dou. As a result, fewer people were eating rice, and trading was gradually declining. It is said that early and late season rice was priced at 375 yuan to 370 yuan per stone (unit of weight). However, retail sales in stores were as high as 440 yuan for thin rice. Glutinous rice also required 40 yuan. Currently, there is no official market for rice, and sales are arbitrary, only increasing the suffering of the people.

### Sales of Coarse Grains Decline

Yesterday, sales of coarse grains were slightly weaker. The supply of beans from the suburbs was no longer scarce, and market sentiment calmed down. Prices fell uniformly by three to five yuan. However, hoarders of bean cake were still actively bidding up prices, and market conditions continued to rise by one to two yuan.

### Yarn and Cloth Fall Slightly

However, the condition of spot yarn remained firm due to a lack of spot goods. 20-count Double Horse factory warehouse receipts initially opened high at 3,190 yuan due to the strong momentum from the previous day. It briefly rose to 3,305 yuan. Subsequently, a prolonged struggle between bulls and bears occurred. Finally, upon hearing that military scrip had eased and then weakened, it fell into the 3,000 yuan range. However, the closing price was 3,015 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 7,380 yuan to 7,400 yuan. 40-count Colored Ball was 7,000 yuan to 6,900 yuan. 40-count Sunlight was 6,850 yuan to 6,900 yuan. 42-count Water Moon was 7,220 yuan. 42-count Xingguang was 7,200 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 3,600 yuan to 3,800 yuan. 20-count Earth was 3,620 yuan to 650 yuan. 20-count Hongxiang was 4,000 yuan. 20-count Limo was 3,920 yuan. 20-count Xiantao was 3,900 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix was 4,100 yuan to 4,000 yuan. 20-count Yueqin was 3,920 yuan. 16-count Red Kuixing was 3,620 yuan to 680 yuan. 16-count Golden Pagoda was 3,730 yuan. 10-count Red Double Horse was 2,610 yuan to 630 yuan.

### Ramblings on "Eating" and Other Matters

— R. Yang

Today, when reading about Feng Xuan's three long sighs in the Strategies of the Warring States, regarding being a retainer of Lord Mengchang, one might be filled with endless emotions!

Originally, Mr. Feng Xuan was living under someone else's roof and still clamored, "Long sword, let's go home, there's no fish to eat," "No carriage to ride," "Nothing to call home." It seems a bit ungrateful. However, he was able to receive Lord Mengchang's successive promises: first, "feed him"; then, "provide him with a carriage"; and finally, send someone to provide for his mother, ensuring she lacked nothing, which is truly enviable. Seeing these three sighs yielding such rewards in the current situation makes one drool with envy. Moreover, what we ask for is secondary. "Fish" may be "what I desire," but we are nearing "no rice to eat"... Domestic rice is not allowed into the concessions. This new ban has immediately caused rice prices to soar several times over. Foreign rice may "only" sell for 170 yuan per picul, but the opportunity to "rise with the crowing of the rooster and go to join the long, winding queue, only to end up empty-handed if one is unlucky" is not something everyone's time and strength can afford. Of course, there are wealthy families who hoard grain for over a year, but what about the general masses who eat from meal to meal, and from day to day? "The cries of 'no rice to eat' will soon resonate throughout the heavens." Even if there are substitutes like six-grain flour and red grains, who can say that these are long-term solutions?

"Eating" has undoubtedly become a serious problem today, so in our view, Feng Xuan's "second sigh" is unnecessary. However, we cannot deny that "no carriage to ride" has indeed become a reality.

### Dancers and the Silver Screen

— Tai Xu

In the scene of Sister Hui's wedding in "Spring," the small stage name and the wedding sedan were specially used, and wooden steps covered with red cloth were placed at the entrance of the aisle in front of the stage. When the groom arrived, he entered from outside the venue, eliciting a burst of laughter from the audience. However, these four hired small stage names likely weren't considered when Ze Fu wrote "Random Talks on the Arts" regarding this aspect of "venue usage." After getting on stage, they simply didn't know where to stand. Therefore, when the second performance opened the day before, Director Hu, the adapter of "Spring," changed into a long gown and escorted the wedding sedan onto the stage, specially taking on the role of directing the position of the small stage names.

It is said that a certain widow is about to leave her late husband's family, but the truth remains to be seen.

Xue Lingxian's widowed husband, Yan Zhexi, is currently a musician at the Guotai Dance Hall. The organizer of this band is Li Dongliang, and the leader is Yan Tongfan.

### Riding Through the Storm Together

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

Lin Shaobang asked, "Has she taken any medicine from a Chinese doctor?" Li Youxie replied, "Mr. Huang Shifu has seen her for consultations yesterday and today. The illness became severe yesterday afternoon." Lin Shaobang shook his head and said, "Having used Chinese medicine, this makes it so I have no confidence. Let's try an injection for now, but..." Lin Shaobang did not explain what medicine it was, or what it treated. He took out two ampoules, combined them, and asked someone to bring out Madam Ye's withered arm and gave her an injection. He also took out a small bottle of pre-mixed liquid medicine and four or five pills.

According to Lin Shaobang, who secretly told Li Youxie, Madam Ye's life might not last until dawn. He took forty yuan for the medicine. Li Youxie and Weicheng saw him out the door, just as they had seen Huang Shifu. Weicheng, seeing Lin Shaobang shaking his head and clicking his tongue, became anxious and fainted inside the gate. The Ye family, thinking that misfortunes never come singly, were so anxious they didn't even dare to shed tears. Four or five people carried Weicheng inside, to his bedroom. They loosened his clothes, rubbed his chest, pinched his philtrum, applied cold towels, and sprayed Wolong pills. After a while, Weicheng woke up. Madam Ye the Second finally breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Weicheng, are you clear-headed now? You must know that no one in the family can withstand any more shocks. If anything happens to you, the Ye family is finished." Weicheng opened his eyes and, not seeing his mother, asked, "Where's Mom?" Li Youxie held him down and said, "Mom is a bit better. Now you need to take care of yourself first. Since ancient times, there have been filial sons, and being able to take care of your own body is filial piety." Weicheng struggled to get up and said, "No, no, I have to see my mother." Aunt He and Axing, one on each side, supported him into Madam Ye's room. The others followed behind. He saw only Sister Cuizhen alone in the room. (27)

### Unfamiliar Faces

— Wang Ye

Unfamiliar faces do not only refer to people outside of relatives and friends; but also those who hum "Deep in the Night" within the boudoir, write "de a ma le" in the attic room, "blow smoke rings" in the small compartment, as well as the "zhong fa bai", X=6Y, "lei lei hua"... all kinds of people, are now running onto the streets. These people, who usually live in overcast days, have now implemented a general mobilization, which is called "unfamiliar faces."

For a face to become unfamiliar, and for unfamiliarity to be seen only on the face, is truly mysterious and unpredictable.

In fact, how difficult is it to "predict"! Rice is expensive, and one can't afford a nanny, so one has to "go out oneself"! Oil needs to be squeezed, coal needs to be squeezed, rice needs to be squeezed. One husband, one wife. The children are too young to come, the older ones are not enough, so one has to "go out oneself"! ... "Go out oneself"! Thus, unfamiliar faces fill the market.

"Fair as a virgin," "thin as rice straw," one must walk even if one can't, one must buy even if one hasn't, if one is lucky enough to avoid it, it's like winning the grand prize in a charity lottery!

Even I am one of the unfamiliar faces; and belong to those who write "de a ma le" in the attic room.

### Casual Words

— Sun Dexiang

When we learn from "experience," we should be very careful. What we should learn is only the "wisdom" part obtained from "experience"; otherwise, we would be like a cat that burned its tail by sitting on a hot stove lid, and next time won't even dare to stay on a cold stove lid. – Mark Twain
