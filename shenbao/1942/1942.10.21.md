### Stalin City Residential Area Completely Flattened, Northwest Red Army Prepares Counter-Offensive, Fierce Fighting Day and Night in Western Caucasus

Stockholm, 20th, Havas News Agency

According to unofficial sources today, there have been no major changes in the Stalin City battle situation in the past day. German troops are busy clearing out the remaining enemy forces in the occupied areas. Simultaneously, they have set up artillery batteries on the right bank of the Volga River, seemingly not attacking the October Revolution factories. However, German official sources claim that the encircled Soviet forces there are in a precarious situation, as the German army controls the Volga River area around Stalin City. Reinforcements crossing the river are impossible. The residential areas inside Stalin City have been completely flattened, with not a single house undamaged. According to German aerial reconnaissance reports, German forces are concentrating again in the northwest of Stalin City, equipped with tanks and artillery. However, there is no indication whether General Timoshenko, the commander of the Soviet Southern Front, has taken the offensive against German positions on the Don and Volga Rivers. Since Sunday, Stalin City and its suburbs have been experiencing torrential rain, but the German forces' mopping-up operations within the city have not been hindered.

This afternoon, the German military communiqué stated that several enemy blockhouses in the mountainous woodland area of western Caucasus were destroyed by our forces. Our forces advancing simultaneously from the north and south met on the mountain roads leading to Tuapse. An enemy counterattack in the Terek region was repelled. In the northern suburbs of Stalingrad, German forces captured more houses defended by Soviet troops. The remaining enemy forces in the Red Barracks and artillery factory area are being cleared. German aircraft heavily bombed the most heavily defended points of the October Revolution factories. A tugboat on the lower Volga River, six airplanes parked on the ground, and several freight trains were destroyed by German aircraft. Romanian troops fighting on the Don River repelled an attacking enemy force.

Moscow, 19th, Havas News Agency

The local radio station just announced that enemy infantry, under the cover of tanks, occupied a certain area of Stalin City after suffering heavy losses. The German side lost 18 tanks and left behind hundreds of bodies in this battle. Simultaneously, our forces continued to operate in the northwest of Stalin City, capturing five enemy blockhouses. Three enemy attacks failed. In the area beyond Bryansk, the enemy's attempt to break through our lines has failed. German infantry, under artillery cover, launched a fierce attack on our positions but were repelled to their original positions after our counterattack.

Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency

Although the fighting northwest of Stalin City has been quiet in recent days, [illegible] Sheikdom is launching a large-scale counterattack.

Ankara, 20th, Huitong News Agency

This morning, Moscow Radio reported that in the western Caucasus region, fighting occurred day and night. Allied forces were forced to abandon two positions and one important high ground. Berlin, 20th, Huitong News Agency

German forces in the western Caucasus, aiming to attack the port of Tuapse on the Black Sea coast, face fierce fighting north and south of the port. Soviet troops are using the mountainous terrain to build defenses, making it difficult to advance. German forces often launch surprise attacks on Soviet troops in concealed locations at dusk, dawn, or in foggy weather, engaging in hand-to-hand combat to capture Soviet fortresses. Soviet troops are striving to defend, not fearing sacrifice. During counterattacks, they set fire to forests, using the thick smoke as cover.

### Commencement Ceremony of the Third Term of the Military Officer Training Corps, Corps Commander Wang Attends and Delivers Instructions

Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency

The third term of students of the Central Army Military Officer Training Corps held its commencement ceremony at the corps headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 20th. Corps Commander Wang attended and delivered instructions, roughly stating that nation-building requires army-building, and army-building must first improve the quality of soldiers. With improved soldier quality, the foundation of army-building is consolidated, and then the expansion of the number of soldiers can be pursued. Since the return to the capital, the National Government and commanders of various units have advocated for elite troops. All officers put aside their important tasks and valuable time to receive training at the corps. The purpose is none other than to realize the concept of elite troops. There are three key points to implementing the elite troops concept. First, we must clearly identify our goal, which is to revive China and East Asia, fundamentally eliminating the communist scourge. This military goal is very consistent and clear. Second, responsibilities must be clear. Military force used correctly can save the country and its people, but used incorrectly, it can harm the country and its people. The military must strictly observe discipline, with tight organization. Without discipline, it is not only equal to having no army, but worse than having no army. To truly achieve strict discipline and tight organization, responsibilities must be clearly defined. Third, we must strengthen our ability to take on responsibility. A North American military textbook has a very poignant statement: one cannon with 100% accuracy is equal to one hundred cannons with 1% accuracy. This shows that only with ability can we use weapons, otherwise, even with excellent mechanical combat equipment, it is futile. In this short month, you must first receive training, first achieving the elite troops concept yourself. When you return to your units in the future, you must train your subordinates and encourage your colleagues. You must all strive in the corps to first achieve spiritual unity, and then expand this spirit to all the troops. In this way, on a small scale, comprehensive peace can be achieved, and on a large scale, we can work together to complete the Great East Asia War and fulfill the important responsibility of reviving China and protecting East Asia. I wish to encourage myself with this, and to encourage you all together.

### African Storm Gathers, Smuts Returns to London to Continue Talks with Churchill, to Deliver Speech in Parliament

Lisbon, 20th, Reuters

According to reports from London, South African Prime Minister Smuts is continuing talks with Churchill. Smuts spent the weekend in the countryside and returned to London yesterday. He is preparing his speeches for the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

Stockholm, Huitong News Agency

[From] London [comes] news that South African Prime Minister Smuts spent his weekend in the countryside to complete his speech to be delivered in the House of Commons soon. At that time, his speech will be broadcast by various British radio stations. Smuts returned to London yesterday.

Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency

The Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur's diplomatic correspondent recently telegraphed that South African Prime Minister General Smuts is currently conducting negotiations in London. Smuts may take the opportunity to raise some military and political issues related to both the United States and South Africa. Smuts is known to favor the most powerful side and is well aware of the United States' planned Greater South African Empire. At this time, Smuts' desire to please the United States seems to be greater than his desire to please Britain. The reason Smuts is consulting with the United States is probably here.

British Newspapers Reveal African Offensive

Stockholm, 20th, Huitong News Agency

British newspapers revealed that the African offensive plan jointly drafted by Britain and the United States will be fully completed before South African Prime Minister Smuts leaves Britain next week. British newspapers believe that Smuts is unlikely to travel to Washington via London to meet with President Roosevelt. British newspapers commented on the landing of American troops in Liberia, saying that the relationship between this matter and future wars cannot be predicted.

Stockholm, 20th, Huitong News Agency

London Electric News, the British Observer, said that the Allied powers are about to launch a major military action in Africa. This remark has aroused comments from various British newspapers. The military correspondent of the Daily Telegraph said that there is no doubt that the Allied forces will launch a decisive military action in Africa at any time. The landing of Allied troops in Liberia and other places on the West African coast is related to the upcoming war in North Africa, but the correspondent did not discuss this point. Many British people believe that the occupation of Liberia is to protect Allied sea and land transport to the Near East and the Persian Gulf. This has great significance for the British and American winter war plans.

Darlan to North Africa to Meet French Generals

Vichy, 20th, Huitong News Agency

It is reported that French Commander-in-Chief Admiral Darlan has departed for Algiers. Political figures strongly state that this trip is purely private because his son is serving as a naval officer in Algiers and is currently ill. His wife went to Algiers a few days ago. However, Darlan may take the opportunity to discuss with North African French generals the various defensive measures that need to be taken given the current landing of American troops in Liberia.

Vichy, 20th, Huitong News Agency

General Pétain met with various dignitaries yesterday and was very busy. He met with Premier Laval and Ambassador Scapini, then met with French Commander-in-Chief Admiral Darlan and Secretary of State General Belaton, and also met with Secretary-General Rocha of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Army Minister General Bridoux.

British and Americans Building Roads in Africa

Lisbon, 20th, Huitong News Agency

Recently, informed sources from neutral countries who arrived here from Africa stated that the British African colonies anticipate that the British and Americans will attack French West Africa during the dry season from late October to May of next year. The British and Americans are currently busy preparing and building their so-called African Burma Road. This road is composed of five strategic highways connecting the west coast of Africa with Egypt. Two of the roads, one from Lagos via Lamy Fortress to Khartoum and one from Douala via Stanleyville to Khartoum, are longer than China's Burma Road. To transport the cargo carried by a medium-sized cargo ship via the above two routes would require about 1,500 trucks and would take several weeks. Therefore, three other routes are being built. Western African ports such as Bathurst, Freetown, Monrovia, Lagos, Douala, Libreville, etc., are all between 4,000 and 5,000 kilometers from Khartoum. It is impossible to travel this long distance without sufficient gasoline. It is now heard that the British and Americans plan to use camels to carry gasoline to various stations along the way to avoid the risk of running out of gasoline midway.

Berlin, 20th, Huitong News Agency

A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that the landing of American troops in Liberia is tantamount to exposing the other side's mask. Berlin was not surprised at all. Roosevelt often disregards the provisions of the Atlantic Charter and arbitrarily invades small and weak countries according to his own will.

Stockholm, 20th, Huitong News Agency

The London Observer said yesterday that most people believe that the landing of American troops in Liberia is exciting news. In fact, the concentration of Allied troops in Africa is enough to weaken the strength of other theaters. This war cannot be decided in Africa, but only in Europe. If an offensive is to be launched, it should be launched in Europe.

Bern, 19th, Havas News Agency

According to news from Berlin, the news of the landing of American troops in the West African black republic of Liberia was reprinted in German newspapers today. The semi-official diplomatic and political newsletter of the Foreign Ministry also wrote an article commenting on it, stating briefly that any small country, if coveted by Churchill or Roosevelt for unfounded reasons, cannot protect itself. This is further proof of the Liberia matter. Washington claims that after the Allied victory in the future, they will carry out reconstruction according to the principles of democracy and lend-lease. Only fools would believe it. We know very well that the United States intends to distribute the world's resources with one hand. In short, President Roosevelt intends to control world trade and use the United States to control the prices of the world market. At the same time, German diplomatic and political figures do not express surprise at the news of the landing of American troops in Liberia. They are now paying attention to the evolution of the military and political situation in Africa in the next few days, because the English newspapers have repeatedly reported rumors about the establishment of submarine bases by French West Africa's Dakar Port and Germany on the African coast.

### Hori Warns Japan to Prepare for Long-Term War, Second Front Not Limited to Europe, War Has Entered New Stage

Tokyo, 22nd, Allied News Agency

Information Bureau spokesman Hori broadcast to the nation last night that the planned second front of Britain and the United States is not limited to Europe, but also includes the Pacific and Africa. In the Pacific, the United States may take the form of a general counterattack against Japan. Hori also warned the entire nation of Japan that the American authorities have recognized Japan's true strength and are now using all their strength to step up the manufacture of military equipment and ammunition in preparation for a long-term war. The war has now entered a new stage and is gradually becoming a long-term war in nature. The first ten months of the Great East Asia War were only its beginning. The Japanese nation should respond with all its strength.

Vienna, 20th, Huitong News Agency

From today onwards, the postal and telecommunications administrations of European countries are under the same mechanism. This is not only beneficial to the participating countries themselves, but also to the entire Europe. I hope that European countries that have not yet joined the union will return soon.

### Britain and the United States Agree in Principle to Organize Supreme Committee

Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency

According to news from Chongqing, Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing will soon depart from Washington to return to Chongqing. While he was in Washington, he proposed that democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union organize a supreme committee of the anti-Axis United Nations to extensively agree in principle on the implementation of relations during and after the war. In addition, the committee plans to include the heads of state of various anti-Axis countries and powerful figures in the political world, and to have Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek as standing committee members to unify the strategic steps of various countries in the war against the Axis powers, so that they can be interconnected and closely connected. However, it is currently unclear what the Soviet Union's opinion is on this matter. Most political figures in Chongqing believe that if the large joint organization is realized, whether its functions can be fully utilized is still questionable. It is also rumored that another plan is to organize a special committee under the Supreme Committee to mediate the Indian issue.

Associate of the Cabinet Michael Antonescu delivered a speech at a workers' meeting in the city of Barasov in the province of Outer Transylvania today, stating briefly that at this point in time, the privileges [illegible] no longer exist, and work is the only source of wealth. If we do not want to be slaves in our own territory and want to consolidate our position on both sides of the Carpathian Mountains, the Doria River, and the Black Sea coast, then we must recognize that only under the condition that continuous work supports the soldiers fighting on the front lines can we realize this wish. Hungary and Romania are in dispute over the sovereignty of the province of Outer Transylvania. Neither side will give in. Hungarian Prime Minister Kere recently gave a speech in Ungvár, saying that Hungary has recovered its lost territory and will never lose it again, seemingly positioning itself as the leader of the Carpathian Mountains.

### Portuguese Newspaper Reviews Current European Political Situation

The well-known "Manha" newspaper in this area recently published an article reviewing the current European political situation. The article stated that the most significant fact of the past week is that the Soviet Union is independently resisting the German forces and anxiously hopes for the speedy opening of a second front, leading to increasing disagreement with its allies. However, it seems to have forgotten its own attitude when the second front existed, i.e., before the defeat of France. At that time, it joined hands with Germany, only wanting to obtain the necessary peace to safely digest the Polish territory it had occupied by dishonorable means. The United States is now adopting a realistic attitude, deeply aware that if the Soviet Union is left to its own devices and is not saved, it will inevitably lead to isolation and trouble in the future. Therefore, the U.S. government is eager to take more decisive action, but it is still difficult to take effective military action because preparations are insufficient. Britain still maintains its traditional wait-and-see policy, unwilling to take risky actions that would jeopardize its entire future. In addition, the military command must be unified before the second front is opened, but the time is not yet ripe. We often see diplomatic personnel and government officials from various countries actively trying to solve this difficulty, but they keep their missions secret and only make vague statements indicating that they have no important tasks.

### Silver and Banking Industries Make Efforts to Promote Commercial Acceptance Bills to Facilitate Trade and Restore Inherent Commercial Credit; Industries Can Enter into Acceptance Contracts with Banks

To facilitate the trade of goods and restore inherent commercial credit, the silver and banking industries are promoting commercial acceptance bills. Banks and financial institutions are willing to discount commercial acceptance bills, and leading banks are also willing to rediscount them. Commercial acceptance bills are issued by the seller upon delivering goods to the buyer, specifying payment within a certain number of days after sight. The bill is sent to the buyer for signature and acceptance. Before the bill's maturity, the seller can seek a guarantor and request the bank to discount the bill. The discounting bank will collect the payment from the buyer (the acceptor) on the maturity date. If the commercial credit of the buyer's accepted bill is relatively poor, the seller or the buyer can enter into an acceptance contract with the bank, using the goods being traded as collateral, allowing the seller to have the bank accept and discount the forward bill. To prevent speculators from taking advantage, banks will pay attention to the process by which the bill is issued, such as bills issued by manufacturers and accepted by wholesalers, or bills issued by wholesalers and accepted by retailers, as the process will be smoother and reduce potential abuses. The following is an abstract of the proposed acceptance contract:

Providing Collateral

The acceptance contract stipulates: (1) The drawer issues the remittance for the sole purpose of paying a certain party. (2) The maturity date of the bill issued by the drawer is limited to a maximum of a certain number of days. (3) The drawer shall deposit the funds into your bank a few days before the maturity date of the bill for payment, without fail. (4) The acceptance fee is calculated at a certain percentage per mille of the face amount and shall be paid by the drawer upon each request for acceptance. (5) Your bank may notify the drawer at any time to stop accepting or reduce the limit, which the drawer agrees to comply with. (6) If the value of the collateral falls below the market price at the time of the agreement, the drawer shall immediately increase or replace the collateral to compensate for the reduced value, at least to the extent required to make up the difference. (7) Your bank shall not be responsible for any loss of the collateral due to material deterioration, quantity shortage, or damage caused by natural disasters or other force majeure events. The drawer shall replace the collateral with equivalent value. (8) The type and quantity of collateral to be replaced or added by the drawer must be approved by your bank.

Supplemental Payment

(9) The collateral shall be insured by the drawer with a fire insurance policy in your bank's name (or with your bank as the priority beneficiary) with an insurance company approved by your bank at the market value. If your bank deems it necessary to add war insurance or other types of insurance, the drawer agrees to comply. All formal insurance policies and premium receipts shall be submitted to your bank for safekeeping, and the premium shall be borne by the drawer. In case of an accident, your bank is entitled to receive compensation directly from the insurance company to offset the amount advanced by your bank. If the compensation is insufficient, the drawer shall make a supplemental payment. If your bank deems it necessary to provide additional collateral before receiving the compensation, the drawer agrees to comply. If the insurance company refuses to pay the compensation for any reason, or if the compensation is insufficient, it shall not be the responsibility of your bank, and the drawer shall make a supplemental payment of equivalent collateral or cash. (10) If the drawer fails to promptly insure the items in the previous clause, your bank may handle the insurance on its behalf, and all expenses shall be borne by the drawer. However, your bank has no obligation to handle the insurance. (11) Documents such as warehouse receipts and bills of lading shall be endorsed by the drawer for the purpose of establishing a pledge, and the documents shall be transferred to your bank's account. Your bank shall be entitled to retrieve or inspect the contents of the goods at any time, and the drawer shall not object. All procedures, including transportation, customs clearance, and taxes and fees for storage and sealing, shall be handled by the drawer.

### Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Talks About Punishing American Airmen

The Allied Press reports from this port. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department, stated yesterday (Tuesday) during a press conference that the severe punishment of inhumane enemy airmen is in accordance with the Japanese Bushido, and those who commit cruel and barbaric crimes will not be treated with leniency. Mr. Yokoyama strongly criticized the enemy's propaganda using the word "Bushido" to achieve its own goals, saying that the enemy's propaganda quoting Bushido shows that Bushido is only practiced by the Japanese. The condolence telegram received from San Francisco radio station on April 16 reported that American prisoners of war were treated favorably in Japan. At that time, I warned my superiors that this broadcast should be treated with caution. Two days later, American bombers flew to Japan, and I personally saw them strafing schoolchildren. Therefore, we can only feel resentment towards the enemy's inhumane behavior using the name of Bushido. The purpose of our condolence telegram and the San Francisco broadcast was to make American airmen not believe that they would be killed if captured after bombing Japan. This fact is sufficient to show that the enemy violates the principles of Bushido. Based on my previous experience in Vietnam, when the Japanese army was about to enter Vietnam, Britain, the United States, and Chongqing colluded with the then Governor-General of Indochina to prevent the Japanese army's actions and made great propaganda, claiming that the large number of military supplies transported to Chongqing via Vietnam was all unfounded. They also repeatedly stated that the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam violated Bushido. Furthermore, at that time, British Ambassador to Japan Grew and the American and French ambassadors all argued to Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke that the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam violated the principles of Bushido. At that time, I personally witnessed this false propaganda in Vietnam, because military supplies were piled up everywhere, and they were all being transported to Chongqing via Yunnan and Guangxi.

### Memorial Gift Used for Educational Assistance

I am enclosing a check for the same amount and would appreciate it if you could acknowledge receipt. Sincerely, Zhu Qingzeng, October 20, 31st year of the Republic. Cultivating talents is indeed difficult but worthy. I hereby express my gratitude on behalf of the poor students." Yesterday, the educational assistance received totaled 1,000 yuan from Zhu Qingzeng, 100 yuan from Bian Shugong, 31.7 yuan from Fa Wenhua (picked up), and 9.3 yuan from Wang Mo, Hou Qianheng, and Nianhe, totaling 141 yuan.

### Final Report (4) Conclusions and Recommendations on French Concession Defense Exercises

The results of the air defense exercises in the Shanghai French Concession are very satisfactory and meet the expectations of the Japanese authorities responsible for air defense in Shanghai. However, there are still many points that need to be improved, such as concealing lights and general discipline, which residents should conscientiously comply with. Regarding the concealment of lights, attention should be paid to places such as bathrooms, kitchens, corridors, etc., which are easily overlooked in general exercises because they are not used. Some residents only conceal lights in one room and ignore other rooms. This method is very bad, because when the exercise time is extended, people in the room will inevitably have to go to a certain room or a certain room to take necessary items. In addition, residents often neglect the windows of small courtyards and gardens of houses. They think that as long as the indoor lights do not leak out to pedestrians, the concealment measures are perfect, but they do not know that their lights can sometimes be seen by people looking down from a high place. Therefore, special attention must be paid to small windows and small openings facing the sky, which must be turned off or carefully covered. Also, residents do not seem to fully understand the meaning of the various exercises. Currently, there are two types of exercises: one is an alarm exercise, and the other is an air raid exercise.

### Strengthening Citizens' Physique is an Important Undertaking

### Health Insurance: High Standard of Living, Illness Cannot Be Afforded, Prevention is Better Than Regret

With such a high standard of living, one simply cannot afford to get sick. This is a truth felt by almost everyone in the lower and middle classes. Of course, since the soaring prices, people's livelihood has been greatly affected. Those who live on salaries are fortunate to be healthy and can use their spirit or labor without fear of hunger and cold. If unfortunately, they are afflicted with illness, the medical expenses are considerable, especially for Western medicine. Since the interruption of overseas transportation, sometimes even with a large ocean, you still can't buy medicine. If it is even more unfortunate that the illness is incurable and medicine is ineffective, then at least the most basic coffin costs thousands of CRB, even though there are free coffins available, but for the sake of dignity, one has to grit their teeth and bite the bullet. Under this combination of life abnormality and economic abnormality, the suffering of the sick family can be imagined, and the importance of health is increasing day by day.

General Health Organizations in Various Countries

In fact, ensuring health cannot rely solely on the efforts of the medical community. True health lies in preventing illness. When it comes to health, the first thing to pay attention to is health preservation. Those who are good at health preservation will definitely be healthy, preventing disease before it occurs, knowing the disease when it is not yet obvious, and treating the disease when it is in its early stages. These three can be said to be the central tenets of health preservation. All countries in the world pay great attention to these, and various health organizations have been established. The so-called health undertakings are health insurance. Health insurance organizations can be broadly divided into public and private. Public health insurance began in 1871. All civil servants and employees contribute 4% to 6% of their salaries as health insurance fees, with designated doctors and hospitals as guarantees. In addition to the above-mentioned personnel, private health insurance is open to freelancers, housewives, children, and others who can join freely. They can hire family doctors for consultation. In Germany, there are about 20 million insured people, with annual premiums exceeding 1.2 billion marks. In the United States, the figure reaches 360 million yuan, averaging 30 yuan per person. Russia has 2.5 billion rubles of social insurance premiums, and Japan's disease prevention expenditure is 3 million yuan, with health undertakings costing more than 30 million yuan. This type of public health insurance is mandatory, with the employer or company bearing one-third of the insurance premium and the employees bearing two-thirds. Private health organizations are completely different, and there is no special agreement with any doctors. Members of private health insurance societies can hire their private doctors for consultation and pay the fees to the private doctors or hospitals themselves, and then recover the fees from the insurance agency.

Service Effectiveness Has Precedent

To explain in more detail, such as member number 100,000 of the New York Hospital Service Insurance Company, who is a completely healthy person. If he suddenly falls ill and needs to be hospitalized, although he usually pays very little in membership fees, he can be hospitalized and treated for free for three weeks at this time. If he continues to be hospitalized after the expiry date, he can still enjoy a 25% discount. The health insurance fee in New York City is a model for 24 large-scale health companies. The lowest premiums in the two cities of Cleveland and Buckingham are six jiao per month, Rogers Trott is six jiao five fen, and Sacramento and New Orleans are seven jiao five fen. An elderly man in New York, 50 years old, strongly opposed joining the health organization when someone first persuaded him to join, but three weeks after joining, he was sent to the hospital due to severe pneumonia. When he was discharged from the hospital, the hospital bill was only two yuan and six jiao. Another person was unemployed and fell badly one day. After being sent to the hospital, he was treated with X-rays and drugs and was hospitalized for a week. He was discharged without spending a penny.

Health Society Advocated in the Beginning

Does China have similar health organizations? Yes, before the war, the municipal government, the Yexin Qishe, and the Hongqiao Sanatorium separately established the Shanghai Health Security Association and the China Health Society to maintain public health, aiming to obtain medical security with minimal membership fees. Taking the China Health Society as an example, all persons and their families residing in the Shanghai urban area can become members of the society and enjoy various medical benefits in accordance with the regulations. On average, the membership fee is one fen and six li per month, and all consultations can be free of charge. Paying a membership fee of one jiao and three fen per day can make hospitalization and all medical expenses free. The China Health Society paid great attention to disease prevention at that time, implementing various examinations for lung disease, cancer, venereal diseases, and eye diseases, as well as general health checkups. In addition, the society sent personnel to visit members' daily life and hygiene methods at any time to provide detailed guidance to enhance the health and happiness of members' families.

Health Checkups Can Be Divided into Three Types

Speaking of health checkups, one can think of its purpose: rather than regretting it endlessly, it is better to prepare for a rainy day. The health checkup work of the China Health Society was undertaken by the Hongqiao Sanatorium. Generally speaking, it can be divided into three types: one is biological examination, which includes various bacterial and microbial examinations, blood reactions, etc.; the second is physical examination, which includes blood pressure measurement and X-ray fluoroscopy; and the third is chemical examination, which includes examination of sugar, protein, and gastric juice. The Hongqiao Sanatorium is still continuing two types of health checkups: one is physical examination, and the other is X-ray group examination. The former examination covers the whole body organs, especially focusing on the heart and lungs. Blood, sputum, feces, etc. are also examined chemically. The latter only uses X-rays to examine the heart and lungs.

Artificial Pneumothorax Aims to Treat the Lungs

From the lungs, we think of the large number of people in China suffering from lung diseases, and it is necessary to promote the medical method of artificial pneumothorax. In 1832, James Holden M.D. noticed that a patient with severe tuberculosis gradually recovered due to spontaneous pneumothorax. Fifty years later, Forlanini reported that injecting air into the pleural cavity could treat tuberculosis, but it was not yet implemented. It was not until 1906 that there was a report of the disease being cured by artificial pneumothorax. Before performing artificial pneumothorax, the lungs must first be fluoroscoped with X-rays to know the extent of the disease. Then, a needle is inserted into the pleural cavity, and an appropriate amount of air is injected according to the pressure during breathing. The purpose of artificial pneumothorax in medical treatment is fivefold: (1) To make the diseased lung stop moving, thereby achieving local rest. (2) To reduce the tension of the lungs to facilitate the contraction of the disease during pathological recovery. After patients with tuberculosis have undergone artificial pneumothorax, the tension of the lungs is reduced, and the disease points can also be pathologically contracted. (3) The cavities in the diseased lungs can be eliminated due to forced compression. (4) To slow down the circulation of the lymph, reducing the chance of transporting tuberculous toxins into the blood, thereby healing the systemic symptoms as well. (5) After the patient has been treated until there are no tubercle bacilli in the sputum, the disease can no longer be spread to other parts of the body, such as the throat and intestines, and at the same time, it will no longer be spread to the remaining healthy parts of the lungs.

It is said that recently, leaders from all walks of life have initiated the organization of China Health Co., Ltd., uniting major hospitals, sanatoriums, testing institutes, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical factories to establish a medical service center. Once established, it will promote anti-tuberculosis campaigns, popularize health checkups, and organize health insurance. In today's society, where insurance companies are springing up like mushrooms after rain, health insurance is an urgent need.

### Government Bonds Remain Strong

Yesterday, the over-the-counter market for government bonds continued to rise, and strong gains were seen across all bonds, reaching record highs. This strength was unprecedented, with short covering and new long positions advancing together. Although long positions were also not weak in selling, the market readily accepted them. The spot market showed an image of demand exceeding supply at any time. Class C bonds immediately traded at 67 yuan when first sold, rising 1.2 yuan, and a high price of 7.8 yuan was seen. As a result, all market prices rose by 8 jiao to 1.9 yuan. The trading volume was close to 3 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 66.20 65.20 65.80 Up 1.70

Unified B 65.50 63.60 65.00 Up 1.20

Unified C 67.80 66.50 67.70 Up 1.90

Unified D 62.70 61.70 62.60 Up 1.00

Unified E 64.50 63.00 64.40 Up 1.80

96 14.00 2.40 12.50 Up 0.80

### Mill Cloth Continues to Rise, Dong Cloth Slightly Declines

Mill Cloth

Yesterday, the market situation remained strong. White goods and fine cloth continued to rise by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece due to demand exceeding supply. 12-pound Earth fine cloth rose from 170 yuan, and the market rose to 171.5 yuan. There were buyers of Dapeng fine cloth at 167 yuan, Fugui new single at 164 yuan, old single at 161.5 yuan, Fugui fine twill at 146 yuan, 16-pound Earth fine cloth at 199 yuan, Flying Goose at 196 yuan, 9-pound New Character at 112.5 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong at 109 yuan. There was generally no change in coarse cloth. There was little trading in Peach Blossom Lady Shilin, and the price was between 255.75 yuan and 6 yuan, without any gains or losses. However, other colored cloths, such as Chudan gallstones and Meiting, continued to rise firmly.

Dong Cloth

Initially weak and then firm, slightly declining compared to the previous day. For example, the smallest price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth new single was 178 yuan, and the afternoon closing price rose again to 180 yuan, down 5 jiao. Bank single Longtou was 169.5 yuan, Caiqiu was 168.5 yuan, Feiyu was 167 yuan, Yang Su Zhu was 165.5 yuan, and Laba was 154.5 yuan, all falling back by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan per piece. Sijunzi Bi Ji red single 7 dimes 1 jiao 9 fen fell to 7 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen 3 fen, and then rose again. The afternoon closing price was 7 yuan 1 jiao 9 to 2 jiao, down 4 fen and a half.

### Ornaments Gold Stabilizes

Yesterday, the Dashin and other jewelry stores in the city maintained the listed price of 2,550 yuan per tael of gold ornaments (purchases were reduced by about 300 yuan). The inter-dealer price had stopped rising and tended to fluctuate. In the morning, it was 2,340 yuan, the same as the noon price of the previous day, and then briefly dropped slightly by 30 yuan to 2,310 yuan. However, it soon rose again, and the noon price was 2,335 yuan, 5 yuan less than the previous day, with a difference of 30 yuan. Trading was thin. Finally, at 2,340 yuan, it was 20 to 30 yuan less than the final price of the previous day. The listed price of patterned silver ornaments was still 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price was 13 yuan and 3 yuan and 2 jiao as the entry and exit price for operators. Yesterday, the Public Association of Money Dealers did not change the discount rate and still listed it at 1 jiao and 4 fen.

Yesterday, military tickets suddenly strengthened. The sales price at the front door of the silver shop and small money house was 5 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen, and the purchase price was 4 fen and a half and 5 fen, which was quite different. The inter-dealer price was 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 57 li as the entry and exit price, slightly rising, which was also the result of sugar merchants joining together.

### Commercial Briefs

Cigarette Prices Rise Sharply

Under the influence of rumors and gossip, hoarders are unilaterally raising prices, making the market tight. The price of Great Britain brand reached 9,350 yuan per case, a sudden increase of 350 yuan. Old Knife brand was 8,100 yuan, up 500 yuan. Pin Hai was 7,900 yuan, up 650 yuan. Wuhua was 7,100 yuan, and Fairy was 7,100 yuan, both up 400 yuan. The rise in Japanese cigarettes was still slow.

Sparse Trading in Miscellaneous Grains

The market situation for beans remained firm and quiet yesterday, and trading was exceptionally sparse. Only 30 packages of Chongming Sand Red were opened at a price of 175 yuan. The arrival and sales of red sorghum were scarce. Yesterday, one carload of Mingguang red sorghum was opened at a price of 113 yuan. Although investors in bean cakes were not actively absorbing, the market situation remained stable. Yesterday, two carloads of Yuanlong bean cakes were opened at a price of 68.5 yuan, and one carload of Feizi bean cakes was opened at a price of 68 yuan.

Crude Sugar Shares Continue to Loosen

Yesterday, sugar shares continued to soften due to quiet entry and exit. The association drew the plate and crude sugar shares traded at 299 yuan, a slight decline of 1 yuan, with only 200 packages traded. Red sugar shares were called at the original price and did not trade.

### Talking About the Drama of Fullness and Defect (Part Two)

From the Evolution of Kunqu and Yiyang Opera to the Script of "Selling Horses"

The Chuichang tunes heard in Peking opera seem to be mostly in martial plays, which shows that most of the martial plays are adapted from Yiyang opera. If you want to choose a civil play that purely sings Chuichang, it seems that only "Selling Horses" exists. It is said that Zhu Suyun was the first northern actor to sing this play, but naturally we must promote Mei Wanhua, who sang it so famously that everyone, women and children, knew it. I still remember the first time I saw Mei's performance, it was a single-character play, Xiao Liwu, with Li Shoushan playing Li Qi, Jiang Miaoxiang playing Zhao Chong, Xiao Changhua playing Grandpa Hu, and Zhang Chunyan playing Li Baotong. This is a bit of a cross-dressing. Anyway, the supporting roles have to do everything and cannot care about the distinction between Laosheng and Xiaosheng.

The play usually performed is only four acts: "Crying in Prison," "Writing the Petition," "Three Pulls for Reunion," and "Reunion." The original name is "Qi Shuang Hui." In the 39th volume of the "Xikao" published by the Zhonghua Library, the first half of the play is printed, and the second half is arranged in the 40th volume. However, it is not Chuichang but smoothly flows. The play "Upward Drive and Soaring Energy" must be a rewritten version of the "Qi Shuang Hui" by the playwriting gentleman. Logically, the first half, called "Losing the City and Prison," is very suitable. If the entire play is performed, it seems better to use "Selling Horses" as it is more complete. Unfortunately, my eyesight is too poor and I have never seen the entire performance.

In addition to the "Xikao" record, I have also seen the script of the Experimental District in the second collection of "Xidian." Only the last four acts differ somewhat in content from the "Xikao," but compared to the "Jiahua Station," it is slightly better than the "Xikao." Recently, thanks to my friend Mao Zipei, who sent me a copy of the "Selling Horses" from the Forbidden City, which is complete with Gongche and gongs and drums, and the wording is also better than the two types I have seen before. It can truly be called a definitive edition. Sun Hengyi, a famous Kunqu opera fan, printed it for his birthday. He is willing to make such a precious court original public to the like-minded. This is enough to show his extraordinary mind. (Note: This script is sold by Saoyeshanfang, and the price per copy is ten yuan. The entire book is printed from zinc plates and is very eye-catching.)

### Explaining "Qi Bu Wen Tan" (Part Two)

— Su Shaoqing

Beautiful women are the cause of trouble, so Daji was executed to punish Zhou, and Xishi was sunk in Wu. The beauty of women can bewitch Yangcheng and enchant Xia Cai. Men are closely surrounded by warriors whose achievements are perfect, and they will definitely seek women to vent their great desires. Once they encounter a beautiful woman, they unconsciously enter her shell. Heroes find it difficult to overcome the barrier of beautiful women, and treacherous heroes also find it difficult to overcome the cold. It was Diao Chan's scheme that eliminated the two evils of Dong Zhuo and Lu Bu with Qiao Qi Chang's father and son. Wang Yun's chain scheme was brilliant, so it is endlessly enjoyable to substitute for the play. The play "Fengyi Pavilion" is often performed in opera troupes, and there is a Lian Yiliu in the Yuan Dynasty that serves as the blueprint for "Fengyi Pavilion." In the early Qing Dynasty, there was "Dingchi Chunqiu" as a palace performance series of plays. The civil servants who were specially compiled by imperial decree are the full version of the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms". The entire play is Kunqu opera, starting from the Oath of the Peach Garden to the Discussion of Swords (Wang Yun summoned Cao Cao to discuss swords, secretly plotting to assassinate Dong Zhuo, Cao Cao was willing to take on the task, and Yun gave him a treasure sword). Dedicating the Sword (Cao Cao used the dedication of the sword as a cause to assassinate Zhuo. When the matter failed, he fled), Releasing Cao (Cao Cao was captured in Zhongmu. The county magistrate Chen Gong had the episode of meeting Lu and not killing Lu, which is different from the current skin note version), Qi Bu Wen Tan, Three Battles, Worshipping the Moon, Small Banquet, Large Banquet, Giving the Crown, and Throwing the Battle (Wang Yun and Cao Cao conspired to assassinate Zhuo, and the plan failed and saw the family prostitute Diao Chan worshipping the moon, feeling worried about the country. Yun thought that the girl was destined to perform the chain scheme and then succeeded. This play consists of more than ninety episodes, and it takes about a dozen days to perform the series, which is really a grand view). During the Tongguang period, Beijing's Sanqing Garden performed the full version of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", imitating the Kunqu opera version of the Qing Palace and turning it into a skin note play with additions and deletions. Some people said that it was compiled by Lu Yunzi, but I don't know if it is true. The plays commonly performed on the stage today, such as "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Slaying Hua Xiong," "White Horse Slope," "Fengyi Pavilion," "Passing Five Passes," "Gucheng Meeting," "Changban Slope," "Gathering of Heroes," "Sweet Dew Temple," "Manghua Pool," "Chaisang Mouth," "Walking Mai City," "Building White Robes," "Lianying Case," and "Empty City Plan," are all legacy plays of the Sanqing troupe. When I was in Beiping in the early Republic of China, the Fuliancheng Opera School performed the "Three Kingdoms Palace" series of plays in Guanghe Lou, but they could not start from the beginning and set a price because the script had already been lost and no one had rewritten it. Today, if there is a stage that can perform the full version of the series "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", it will definitely cause a sensation and control the profitable tickets.

### Seaside Book Venue Tour

— Jian Fan

(3) Central Book Venue

The hall downstairs in the Central Hotel on Fifth Avenue, seventeen or eighteen years ago, was one of the first hotels in Shanghai to emulate the Oriental Hotel and convert its empty hall into a book venue. However, due to poor business, it closed down not long after. After the war, it was converted into a dance hall. For a period, it was used as a female storytelling venue during the daytime. At that time, the lineup included Xie Letian and his disciple Xiaotian, telling "Yu Qing Ting", Zhao Meifang and her niece Tu Fang, telling "The Three Smiles", and Wan Xuejun's "Yang Naiwu," which were all very popular for a time, but stopped again in less than a year. Recently, the Central Dance Hall has suddenly transformed into a storytelling venue with string and plucked instruments during the day. The music stage serves as the storytelling stage, and the audience seats are set up in the dance floor, which is quiet and free of noise. The storytelling sound is also very concentrated, making it an ideal new type of book venue. Unfortunately, apart from watermelon seeds, there are no other snacks for sale in the venue. Sitting and drinking clear tea while listening to the storytelling is a bit monotonous. Perhaps due to the location and the fact that it is not an old book venue, coupled with the hot weather, the audience is not large. The current lineup consists of five acts, such as Xue Huiping and Zhong Yueqiao's "Yu Qing Ting". Although they are young ballad singers, their singing and storytelling are very skilled. Gu Hongbo's "The Civet Cat for Crown Prince" has reached the point of interrogating Guo Huai, which is a very interesting turning point in the story. Xu Yunzhi's "The Three Smiles" is still a new addition, and he tells it very delicately and engagingly. Yan Xueting's "Yang Naiwu" is performed by a disciple of his, and the final performance of "The Three Smiles: Hangzhou Story" is a joint performance by the Yu Xiaoyun and Xiaoxia brothers, telling "The Legend of the White Snake" to see the guests off. The art of storytelling is all above standard and worth listening to.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Huanglong, Weicheng, and Cuizhen were inside a room in the back. They hadn't said a few words when a servant girl named Magpie came in. "Someone named Qin wants to see the young master. He's making a scene outside the gate with Ah Xing. Ah Xing told him the young master wasn't home, but he didn't believe it. He asked the second madam where she was. He said he had to talk to the young master." Weicheng raised his head and thought for a moment, then said, "The surname Qin, is it Qin Runzhi?" Magpie said, "That's right, Qin Runzhi. He's been here before. He said he used to be a matchmaker for you, young master." Huanglong said, "He's alone, what are we afraid of? Even if there were ten of them, we wouldn't be afraid." Weicheng said, "It's not a question of whether we're afraid or not. I know he's a member of Wei Yunqing's faction. His arrival here might bring some news from the Wei family." As he said this, Ah Xing walked in and said, "Young master, the second madam is asking you to meet someone with the surname Bang. I told him you weren't home, but the second madam went and told him you were. It's like there are two different stories coming from within our home." Weicheng said, "It's Qin Runzhi, just a pawn. I'll go, I'll go. Brother Long and Sister Cuizhen, don't panic."

He followed Ah Xing outside, knowing that Qin Runzhi was sitting in the Shuangmei Study, so he straightened his clothes and walked in. He saw Qin Runzhi and the Second Madam Ye sitting face to face. Qin Runzhi's eyes were very sharp. As soon as he saw Weicheng, he stood up as if jumping, and then clapped his hands, saying, "I'm reporting a message to Young Master Ye. Wei Yun Gong, Lang Shaoyun, is dead. Do you think I should clap my hands or not?" Weicheng's expression was calm and composed. He dared not agree with him, nor did he refute him. He only replied, "I don't know what illness it was." Qin Runzhi said, "He died of book illness. If he had died of being murdered, that would have been better. Now the old man Wei is clamoring to find the person who murdered his son. We all advised him that it's better to leave things alone. Reporting to the authorities is a long way away, and we have to wait for the authorities to come to the village to examine the body. This expense will probably be enough to bury Shaoyun. There were at least twenty of us who advised him, and we finally convinced the old man, who was hungry, to agree. But he wouldn't take out the money, saying, 'Since I didn't give birth to this son, you have to bury him. You can only ask the locals to donate.' He had some reasons, saying that this was a murder case, and in principle, all neighbors and friends cannot escape responsibility, so they should contribute some money." (208)
