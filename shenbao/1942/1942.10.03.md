### Fierce Fighting Continues as German Troops Advance Further into the Northwest District of Stalingrad, Near the Rikov Factories

Havas News Agency, From a Soviet Border Region, 1st

According to German sources, the main strategic objective of the battle for Stalingrad is to cut off traffic on the Volga River. This objective has already been achieved, so Stalingrad itself has lost all strategic importance and has become a scorched earth. The city is now surrounded by German forces on one side, with its southern suburbs completely under the control of German and allied forces. Fierce fighting continues in the northern suburbs, especially in the Rikov factory district. However, due to the German High Command's determination to minimize casualties.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd

Authoritative sources stated yesterday that only a few strongholds in Stalingrad remain in enemy hands. Since German forces occupied the south of the city and advanced into the north, the Soviets only hold a small portion of the northern edge of the city. With the fate of the city decided, the German strategy will focus on avoiding unnecessary sacrifices. In these battles, the German Air Force has been particularly valiant. The eastern bank of the Volga River, facing Stalingrad, has also been subjected to continuous German bombing, destroying many Soviet artillery pieces. The middle and lower reaches of the Volga River, such as Astrakhan and Inratov, are all targets of German air activity. In the Terek region, German forces continue to intensify pressure on the Grozny oil fields, but the extent of the German advance has not been disclosed. Regarding the battles on the central and northern fronts of the Eastern Front, relevant parties do not allow any publication of information beyond what is contained in the war reports.

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 2nd

A report from Moscow states that Soviet officials acknowledge German forces continuing to advance further into Stalingrad's districts, with fierce fighting also occurring in other districts of the city. German aircraft are assisting tank units in combat and bombing the lower reaches of the Volga River. Soviet forces north of Stalingrad attempted to break through German defenses to the south but were met with fierce German counterattacks. Fierce fighting is also taking place in the Moerk region.

Additionally, Domei News Agency, From Shaped Lips, 2nd

Moscow sources report that the situation in Stalingrad has deteriorated. German reinforcements have penetrated further into a narrow, elongated area of about one mile in the northwestern suburbs of the city. After approximately 3,000 rounds each of large-caliber artillery shells and mortar shells, German tanks and infantry, under heavy air cover, launched three consecutive assaults. The Soviet forces were forced to retreat. A large German force of 50 tanks attacked Soviet positions in the northwest of the city. A large number of German reinforcements are arriving daily, including newly formed divisions.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd

After fierce fighting in the northwestern part of Stalingrad, German forces occupied the Vorofka district. Several strong Soviet units were cut off by German forces. The German position in the city is becoming increasingly secure.

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 2nd

According to American newspapers citing Moscow sources, the Soviet situation remains pessimistic. German reinforcements continue to advance in Stalingrad, and the Soviet connection with the eastern bank of the Volga River is also being cut off by German artillery fire. General Timoshenko's offensive from the north has also been unsuccessful because German forces have consolidated their positions between the Don and Volga rivers.

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 2nd

A dispatch from Moscow states that the Soviet General Staff acknowledged last night that Germany is intensifying pressure on the southeast of Mostok and Novorossiysk. The Soviet position is precarious.

Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 2nd

Yesterday's Hungarian war report stated that the Hungarian forces on the Eastern Front are holding their positions in various locations in a quiet manner.

### Guaita Comments on the Eastern Front Situation

Havas News Agency, Rome, 1st

Guaita, the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, published an article in the Italian Daily today commenting on the Eastern Front situation, stating that while the Soviet Union cannot be considered destroyed in the current war, it can be definitively stated that it is no longer in a very important position to fulfill the task assigned by Britain and the United States to fight the Axis powers. However, the Soviet Union possesses vast resources in terms of manpower and material, due to its vast territory resembling a continent. However, since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, it has repeatedly suffered blows from our side, completely collapsing its strength and leaving it with no hope of victory. On the British and American side, they have also suffered serious blows in the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Arctic Ocean. We certainly do not wish to say that Britain and the United States are about to surrender, but Japan's participation in the war has more than offset the benefits that Britain and the United States have gained from other allied countries. However, the amount of material assistance that the United States provides to Britain is still substantial. The amount of losses suffered by Britain and the United States is more than double their production capacity. In terms of shipping, they are initially unable to compensate for the tonnage sunk by Axis submarines and aircraft. The work we have already undertaken can only be continued. We are well aware that we have not yet won and that we will face various difficulties, as transforming the world and building a new order is a difficult task that cannot be achieved overnight. Furthermore, we are also aware that British and American financial groups will fight to the very last moment. Judging from the speeches delivered by Hitler yesterday and by Prime Minister Mussolini today, it can be seen that the Axis powers are deeply aware of the tasks they bear and will fight to the end to seize final victory.

### French West Africa Governor-General Resolves to Defend Dakar and Orders the Evacuation of European Families

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 2nd

French West Africa Governor-General Boisson recently ordered the evacuation of European families from Dakar, reportedly due to the excessive number of residents hindering the authorities' ability to perform their duties. This order coincides with the British advance in Madagascar and the American landing on the Gold Coast of Africa, highlighting Vichy's concern for Dakar. The French government has recently repeatedly expressed its determination to protect French colonies. If Dakar were to suffer a second attack, the outcome would certainly be different from the events in Syria, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, or Madagascar. It is recalled that French Minister of War General Bridou gave a speech at the unveiling ceremony of the General Honziger monument on September 20th, stating that tomorrow a part of our territory may again be attacked. We must maintain a strong force to defend our honor and thus defend the land inherited from our ancestors. Political figures believe that the Minister of War's words imply that a second attack on Dakar could lead to a large-scale military conflict, but the differences in French domestic political opinion could therefore be eliminated. The activities of the Tergoul faction and Britain and the United States in Vichy or French colonies will inevitably disappear. Only by working together and maintaining iron discipline can we resist foreign aggression and preserve France and its colonies.

Haitong News Agency, Paris, 2nd

Deet wrote an article in the Woflo newspaper this morning stating that Britain and the United States may attack Dakar or Casablanca in order to shake the North African front and undermine the French colonies' loyalty to the motherland. He hopes the government will be vigilant.

Today, when I visited Chairman Wang of the National Government, the Chairman also stated that the National Government is determined to make its best effort to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. In order to share the sweet fruits of the future, we must first endure the hardships. Therefore, in order to complete the Greater East Asia, completing the cooperative posture is currently the urgent task. The establishment of the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia is also a necessary step for Japan itself to realize this East Asian cooperative system. As for the foreign policy of the National Government and other countries after the establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, it will not be changed in the slightest.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd

Japanese State Minister Kazuo Aoki went to the Chairman's residence at 10:00 AM on the 2nd to pay his respects to Chairman Wang and to personally decline the position of Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government.

### Military Facilities Inspected; Roosevelt Returns to Washington for a Week-Long Journey of 9,000 Miles and Plans to Tour Again Next Spring

Domei News Agency, Lisbon, 2nd

US President Roosevelt left Washington on the 17th of last month to inspect the naval bases, arsenals, and shipyards across the country, traveling 8,754 miles. He returned to Washington yesterday afternoon. This was the first time since the United States entered the war that this trip has been conducted in secrecy, and it is unprecedented in American history. Security was very tight along the way. In addition to the adjutant, the only accompanying personnel were representatives from the three major US news agencies. He plans to tour again next spring.

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 2nd

The White House revealed that President Roosevelt has toured various places for two weeks and returned to Washington yesterday. This time, he traveled through the central and western states to the Pacific coast, and then returned to Beijing via the southern states. He inspected the defense zones of the army, navy, and air force, and factories and facilities that manufacture airplanes, armaments, and other important military supplies.

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 2nd

According to the Boston newspaper citing Washington sources, President Roosevelt's plan to grasp supreme command of the US military in terms of strategy, tactics, and operations has been realized. The duties of the Department of the Army have been adjusted. The Chief of Staff reports directly to President Roosevelt on the war situation in various places and serves as an advisor to the Secretary of the Army, but no longer commands the troops in each theater. He only supervises the troops. The regulations of 1936 stipulated that the Chief of Staff would personally command the US military, and General McWorsley was the Chief of Staff at that time. It was generally believed that the US military only needed to fight in one place. Currently, the war has spread globally, and Chief of Staff General Marshall can hardly personally command. Therefore, generals separately command the battles in each region. General McWorsley is stationed on the coast, Lieutenant General Durham is stationed in London, Lieutenant General Eisenhower is stationed in London, and Lieutenant General Tweed is stationed in California, and the military in each region is controlled by the General Staff Headquarters.

Therefore, it is expected that the parliamentary procedures for this difficult bill granting full power to the president can be completed on the 2nd and sent to the president for signature. After Roosevelt approves this bill, the first anti-inflation measures he will take are to use his extensive powers to determine the highest prices for wages, salaries, and agricultural products; secondly, the highest price determined by the president cannot be lower than the highest price of this year before September 15, with exceptions for those that need to be redetermined to correct imbalances; thirdly, employers and employees who violate the rules set by the president and exceed the highest amount of wages and salaries may be fined up to 10 million yuan.

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 2nd

President Roosevelt yesterday criticized the House of Representatives for delaying the passage of the anti-inflation bill. He then discussed important matters with several congressional leaders.

### Local Air Raid Light Control Drill Achieves Good Results; Drill Time Creates a Dark World, Activities Continue as Usual, No Accidents Occur

The large-scale air raid drill in Shanghai over the past two days has proceeded very well. The start and end times were reported by the Greater East Asia Telegraph Company. At 7:03 PM the previous evening, the reporter from the telegraph company solemnly notified citizens that the light control drill had begun, and that all shops and residences should cover indoor lights to prevent them from being visible from the outside. Upon hearing the news, citizens automatically followed the preparations for light control that were expected in the previous month's drill. At around 8:00 PM, the air raid siren was officially sounded, all streetlights were extinguished, and Shanghai became a dark world. 450,000 members of the Public Concession Self-Defense Corps, all members of the French Concession Civil Police Corps that had already been formed, and the foreign residents' self-defense corps of Hongkou that had just been established that day were mostly dispatched to assist the police in maintaining traffic and preventing general petty crime. Senior officials from the Air Defense Section of the police departments of both concessions also departed at this time to inspect various households and shops. The tramcars on Rue du Consulat and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession were suspended for half an hour at 8:30 PM, while traffic in the Public Concession was not interrupted. At around 9:15 PM, the all-clear was sounded, the streetlights were turned on, and everything returned to normal.

Senior Police Officers Depart to Inspect

Yesterday was the second day of the light control drill in both concessions. The start time last night was 7:10 PM. At 6:50 PM, the various Lianbao in the Public Concession received notification from the various police stations, and the Lianbao chiefs led the Self-Defense Corps members to notify various shops to prepare. Therefore, when the Greater East Asia Telegraph Company broadcast the start of the drill at 7:10 PM, the city's lights immediately dimmed due to the early deployment of light-shielding equipment by the shops. After the drill began last night, senior police officers from various police districts departed to inspect the various districts. Chief Ogawa and Department Head Yoshino continued to inspect the Nanjing Road district in the central district, and the inspection did not end until 9:30 PM. At that point, the lights were turned back on.

Air Raid Drill Has Not Yet Begun

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the drills of the previous two nights were only for light control, so there were no incendiary bombs dropped, and the ambulance and fire trucks were only prepared and did not move out. It is expected that the air raid drill will begin in a day or two, at which time paramedics and firefighters will participate in actual operations, so the seriousness of the situation is far greater than the drills of the past few days.

Situation of the French Concession Drill

Last night, the French Concession began its drill for light control earlier than the Public Concession, at 7:00 PM, and ended later than the Public Concession, at 9:40 PM. Most of the newly organized Civil Police Corps went out to patrol. Trams and buses also temporarily stopped on the roads, and pedestrians were all required to follow the instructions of the traffic team formed by the Civil Police Corps and walk slowly along the sidewalks. Paramedics and firefighters also moved out, and the various Lianbao carried the prepared stretchers and beds onto the road to await orders. The tense atmosphere was greater than that of the Public Concession.

### Postal Administration Announces the Issuance of Two New Drafts, Valued at 50 Yuan and 100 Yuan, and Revised Remittance Procedures

Shanghai Postal Administration Savings and Remittance Notice No. 69: It is hereby announced that two new fixed-amount drafts, valued at 50 yuan and 100 yuan, have been printed and issued simultaneously with the existing fixed-amount drafts of 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 15 yuan, and 20 yuan. The remittance fees for these fixed-amount drafts are lower than the remittance fees for ordinary drafts. The application and collection procedures are also simpler than those for ordinary drafts. When applying for purchase, the remitter only needs to verbally state the amount of the draft and the destination to the issuing clerk, without having to fill out a draft application form. After the issuing clerk hands over the draft, the name of the payee is filled in on the draft. If there is an air route for sending the draft to the payee, the letter containing the fixed-amount draft can be sent by airmail, so that the payee can cash the remittance earlier without having to pay an additional air remittance fee as when applying for ordinary drafts. After receiving the fixed-amount draft, the payee only needs to sign and seal the back of the draft to immediately collect the remittance from the cashing office, unlike the procedure for ordinary drafts, which requires waiting for the cashing office to receive the verification slip (i.e., the stub) sent by the issuing office before cashing. For other details, please inquire at the post office. In addition, the minimum remittance fee for ordinary drafts of more than 20 yuan is now set at 15 cents.

### Shanghai Japanese Authorities Plan to Improve Transportation and Expand Cultural Undertakings in the Eastern District of Shanghai

Associated Press, Local News: The Shanghai Hengchan Company, with the assistance of experts from the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs in Shanghai, has drafted a plan for the civil improvement of the entire Shanghai area and submitted it to the Asia Development Board. The basic principles of this plan are to utilize existing conveniences as much as possible, urgently improve transportation, expand cultural activities, and organize public health conveniences. Regarding the improvement of transportation, the most important feature is the proposal to open a high-speed tram line from the North Railway Station to the new residential area in eastern Shanghai and the boundaries of the two municipalities. Under the promotion of culture, there are plans to establish schools, libraries, and hospitals in the eastern district. It is also proposed to establish factories in the Wusong and Pudong districts, but under the current circumstances, it is difficult to obtain the necessary raw materials, so attention will be focused on the construction of residential buildings in the Broadway area. Discussions on the opening of the Jiangwan Racecourse have been delayed for a long time. Another proposal in the current plan is to build products in Wusong.

### Anti-Pickpocketing Campaign Scheduled to Officially Begin; Slogans to Be Posted Inside and Outside Tramcars; Pickpocketing Activities Extend to Restaurants

Shanghai Times reports: It is officially announced that the Public Concession Tramway Company's planned anti-pickpocketing campaign is scheduled to begin on October 6th. This campaign is quite extensive and will cooperate with the Police Department to eliminate pickpocketing on trams, both with and without railcars, in the Public Concession. The police recently announced that they are cracking down on petty theft throughout the city, with pickpocketing being the most common. The tramway company is taking this action. The police are eager to eliminate minor crimes, so they have recently arrested and interrogated many suspects, solving many cases. It is heard that after the tramway company launches the campaign, it will post colorful posters inside and outside the trams, changing them weekly, and hire people to explain to the public how to avoid theft. The Police Department will dispatch special police officers to be on hand at the tram stops where pickpockets are active for anytime inspection. It is heard that those who use pocketing techniques on the trams must have quite enough experience. Common petty thieves do steal on the streets because it is easy to escape. Pickpocketing has also been rampant in restaurants in recent weeks. Customers' wallets have been stolen from the pockets of clothes hanging on the backs of chairs in the Queen's Restaurant, the Three-Color Restaurant, and the Fida Cafe. According to a police officer, it is quite easy for pickpockets to steal in restaurants. They see a coat hanging on the back of a chair, sit at the neighboring table, pretend to reach into their pocket to get money, but actually reach into the other customer's pocket and steal their wallet. Therefore, the public should be careful of such pickpockets when going to public places.

### The Stock Market Focuses Particularly on Department Stores

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation returned to an upward trend. It was expected that the previous day's midday rally would continue. In recent weeks, new stocks have been launched daily. Next Monday, the Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory, famous for its White Cat floral cloth and Peach Lady Lin cloth products, will officially begin trading, having obtained registration certificate No. 56 from the Ministry of Industry. Its grey market price (10 yuan per share) has already risen to 20 yuan, further stimulating already bullish sentiment. The department store sector is particularly favored by investors. China National Goods and Sincere Company both returned to the 120 yuan mark, each rising five or six yuan. Wing On also rose two and a half yuan, all trading in the 122 yuan range. In the textile sector, the smaller denomination Hong Sheng and Great China stocks both closed at 12 yuan.

### Government Bonds Show Weakness, Inflow Cannot Keep Up with Outflow

The over-the-counter trading of government bonds is still lively. After initially continuing the previous day's upward trend with a rise of six or seven cents, it quickly weakened and declined sharply. The previous day's upward momentum has not continued, indicating that buyers are ultimately unable to keep up with the flood of sellers. Any rise is met with selling pressure, a situation unfavorable to the bullish side. The difference between this and the previous upward momentum is like heaven and earth. Yesterday, Class C bonds started trading at 5.3 yuan, rising to 6 yuan. After a quarter of an hour, a sudden surge of sellers caused the market to fall all the way down, breaking through the 6 yuan, 5 yuan, and 4 yuan levels, seeing 3.9 yuan briefly, and finally closing at 4 yuan, down 1.3 yuan. Investor sentiment failed to rally, which is evident here. Class A was at 4.5 yuan, down 9 cents; Class B at 3.6 yuan, down 1.2 yuan; Class D at 1.8 yuan, down 5 cents; and Class E at 2.2 yuan, down 1.1 yuan. This latest rally began on September 25th, with the highest prices being Class A at 7.5 yuan, Class B at 8 yuan, Class C at 8.7 cents, Class D at 5 yuan, and Class E at 6 yuan. Currently, the market is only down a few yuan from those levels. Trading volume was approximately 2 million yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Sales Show Slight Improvement

Factory Cloth

Yesterday, market sentiment was firm and bullish, and actual sales on the street also showed slight improvement. Therefore, white goods, both coarse and fine cloth, were quoted higher by 1-2 yuan per piece. Fine cloth was particularly tight. Twelve-pound Earth brand required 162 yuan, Great Peng new single 159 yuan, Fuguichang single 156 yuan, Bank single 153 yuan, six-pound Earth coarse cloth 189 yuan, Flying Hong 187 yuan, nine-pound New Character 110.5 yuan, and eight-pound Zhenzhong 107.5 yuan. Although transactions were not numerous, sellers were very few. Due to cost considerations, dealers were even less willing to sell dyed goods. Three Sheep Serge new single 6 yuan, Chick Sheeting 244 yuan, Peach Lady Lin scattered goods in the hands of retailers were more plentiful, falling first and then rising, with the midday price showing 235 yuan, subsequently rising 1.75 yuan.

Eastern Cloth

After prolonged declines, yesterday, due to dealers taking in spot goods, sentiment changed and prices rose uniformly. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new single closed at 170.5 yuan, Bank single 160.5 yuan, Color Ball 159.75 yuan, all up four yuan. Flying Fish fine cloth 151 yuan, Yang He 155 yuan, Trumpet 154.5 yuan, Five Blessings 154 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge orders initially opened at 6.86 yuan, midday closing at 7.02 yuan with transactions. Bank single serge at 6.85 yuan was the most popular.

### Gold Jewelry Continues to See Small Declines

Yesterday, at the Shanghai gold shops of Ta Hsin and other jewelers, the quoted selling price for gold jewelry was initially 2,400 yuan per tael. After 11 o'clock, the price was suddenly lowered by 50 yuan, to 2,350 yuan (buying price reduced by about 300 yuan). Inter-dealer trading price initially lowered by 20 yuan to 2,110 yuan for sellers, lowering to 2,095 yuan. Near midday, buyer quotes rose. At noon, 2,110 yuan had a 15 yuan difference. Further lowering by 20 yuan, transactions were very sparse. Jewelry silver remained quoted at 14 yuan per tael, with inter-dealer trading price around 13.5 yuan.

The Money Trade Association's overnight loan interest rate was 1.4 cents, with little change.

The Japanese military currency remained weak. Banks and small money shops sold it for 5.56 yuan and bought it for 5.545 yuan, slightly closer. Inter-dealer trading was sparse at 5.5535 yuan, also a slight change.

### Grain Arrivals and Sales are Both Sparse

Bean arrivals were sporadic and not smooth. Cargo owners tried to push sales, and market momentum tended to be buoyant. Yesterday, 30 bags of Wujiang selected green beans opened at 200 yuan, and over 20 bags of Chongming sand red beans opened at 163 yuan.

Sorghum sales were all weak, and market momentum was flat. Yesterday, a truckload of Mingguang sorghum opened at 115 yuan.

Barley recently arrived from Nanjing in batches. Yesterday, over a hundred bags opened at 115 yuan.

### Daily Necessities Prices Suddenly Rise

The daily necessities market has been quiet for quite some time. Yesterday, market prices suddenly showed a thriving trend, mainly due to mutual absorption, so prices suddenly trended upward. Phoenix brand matches were 2,150 yuan, up 200 yuan. Beautiful brand 2,400 yuan, Golden Tripod brand 2,000 yuan, miscellaneous brands 1,750 yuan, up 50 to 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Soap followed and rose. Gubenzhen soap was 295 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap 260 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap 220 yuan, and Scissors soap 260 yuan, up 10 to 20 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Buddha's Hand Slices are Rarely Offered

Buddha's hand slices produced in Guangdong have not arrived in large quantities recently. Market momentum is flat, and the number of merchants offering them is also small. Currently, the market selling price is 16 yuan per catty, plus commission.

### Watching Li Zongyi and Others' "Gathering of Heroes"

— Su Shaoqing

The New New Opera Troupe has two fresh-faced actors, Li (Li Zongyi and Li Yuzhi), and one seasoned actor, Li (Li Duokui), performing with a brand new look. There are also supporting roles played by Fu Dewei, Zhou Weijun, and others, which makes the troupe quite complete. I heard that Li Zongyi possesses a bright and resonant voice, and Li Yuzhi is also charming and delightful. Li Duokui's old woman role is a unique specialty of modern times. If a neighbor is holding a wedding, people will definitely go to watch. Why? Because the bride or groom is someone that the people have never seen before. Not to mention, in this case, we have a young man and a young woman who are performing for the first time in Shanghai, having never shown their skills here before. It is fitting that there are so many people who want to watch them. I also wanted to go, but time did not permit. On the night of the 27th, I finally had a bit of free time and rushed to the New New Opera Troupe, but there were no seats available. Li Yuzhi's "Starting the Journey" was already over. On stage, they were performing "Gathering of Heroes." Zhou Weijun's Zhou Yu, playing the zither and dancing with a sword, followed the Wang Guiguan style completely, adding a zither song. The zither song was very short, but the sword dance was very long. I think this part is too cumbersome and some of it could be cut. Li Zongyi first played Lu Su and then Kong Ming, singing "Offering Sacrifice to the East Wind." I think his performance as Lu Su was acceptable, with no major flaws. This play belongs to the style of performance plays, which are extremely difficult to do well. Beginning amateur actors are not suitable for this type of play. His dialogue was very loud and clear. In the scene "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats," Lu Su was forced to stay on the boat by Kong Ming to drink wine. Lu sang "Lu Zijing on the boat trembling all over." The four sentences of singing were in the correct tone and the singing method was close to the Ma style, but with more florid middle notes. The upper register was very bright and loud enough to resonate in the hall, while the lower register seemed a bit small. His voice is better than Song Baoluo's, and on par with Ji Yuliang's voice. To determine who is better, I must hear him sing a proper performance play before making a fair judgment. Later, there was his singing of "Offering Sacrifice to the East Wind," but it was already late, so I had to leave my seat and return home. I only saw one young female actress, Li Yuzhi. I did not get to see what she was really like, and I could not help but feel disappointed. One day, I will take the time to watch the full performance and see Li Duokui and Chuan Dewei's plays as well, and then I will be happy. In short, Li Zongyi has a high-pitched voice and can sing florid tunes, which is perfect for the tastes of the people of Shanghai. Not only can he be relied on for business, but he can also become popular with one performance, just like Ji Yuliang, who is blessed with good fortune. He is a lucky amateur actor who has a smooth journey ahead. Congratulations!

### On Chen Dahuo

— Fan Shiren

In recent years, the opera scene has been showing a decline in male roles, either due to the passing of senior famous actors or their retirement due to old age. For the past six years, I have rarely frequented theaters, and there have been few performances that have satisfied me. Chen Dahuo, who came from the amateur scene, performed at the Tianchan Theater. On the second night of his performance, he played at the "Banquet of Ministers." I was invited by my friend Mr. Shen to listen to it, and I was unexpectedly captivated after listening to one song. Afterwards, I went to watch his "Pounding the Tablet," "Hongyang Cave," and "Taiping" plays in succession. I knew that he had been taught by a master and was extraordinary. Except that his declining school of opera lacked a bit of age, I was very satisfied with his black ginseng play. This is probably related to his age. I remember that since Meng Xiaodong performed in Gold before returning to the north, Dahuo is the first person who can satisfy people's expectations. His voice is sweet and clear, and he has all five notes, with good high and low registers and no left-leaning disease. His singing is beautiful, his pronunciation is like pearls, and he is well-versed in the four tones, with very few inversions. His recitation is clear, loud, refined, and generous, without losing the Tan Yu style. His oral skills are better than those of the actors who came from the north, and he can be said to be a rare talent in the late male opera scene. However, his body skills are still lacking due to his leg skills not being agile and stable enough. If he can wear high-soled boots, run more around the stage, and practice diligently for two or three months, it will not be difficult to improve. Dahuo's stage experience as a friend is obviously insufficient, and it is also natural to be flustered and confused. However, this cannot be used to judge his art. The uneven matching of Tianchan naturally also affects its box office appeal. In the past, when Tan Da Wang and Xiao Yu first came to Shanghai, their artistic reputation was not yet known, so they were not noticed. If Dahuo can not be afraid of difficulties and work hard for three or five years, his art will definitely be remarkable. In the future, Chen Dahuo will be regarded with new eyes by the people of Shanghai. I also hope that he can go to Beiping once. If the people of Beiping have ears, there is no doubt that he will become popular. If he comes to Shanghai again, the psychology of the people of Shanghai will be greatly changed. Dahuo is still young and a formidable person. I heard that he is humble and I have unlimited hope for him.

### Famous Sprinter Wang Yuanyue Enters the Film Industry

— Wen Zhen

Miss Wang Yuanyue, the most beautiful of the former Northeast Five Tiger Generals, suddenly met the people of Shanghai on stage this spring as Xiang Yun in "Dream of the Red Chamber." Lively and natural, she has quite a bit of artistic talent. After graduating from the Beijing American Overseas Chinese Middle School, Miss Wang entered Soochow University in her hometown, so she has a good command of English. Western newspapers often publish her works. "China Digest" has often published her works on stage experience, and her writing is lively and praised by Chinese and foreigners. The news came that this beautiful female general joined China United Film out of love for art. If she can use the spirit of the sports field in the film industry, she will surely shine brightly and become a brilliant star.

### Random Talk on the Theater Scene

— Yiqing

Lanxin Resumes Business, Yao Ke Temporarily Serves as Manager

Huayi Opens a Dock, Opposed by Actors

Shanghai Art Troupe Reorganized, Second Reorganization

Xia Xia Earns a Monthly Salary of 2,000, Guest Starring in Lihua

Han Fei Decides to Leave Shanghai and Go North Within Days

In the Shanghai theater scene over the past month, it can truly be said that the general trend of the world is that things unite after a long period of separation and separate after a long period of union. It is so smoky that people feel like they are in a fog, unable to distinguish who is cooperating with whom and who is breaking up with whom.

Let's talk about Lanxin. After "Sherlock Holmes" was being performed on the second night, it was sealed due to British production reasons. It has been two months now, and it has been unsealed by the Mid-Autumn Festival. It is managed by the China Film Company, with Yao Ke temporarily serving as manager. This is because Yao Ke is familiar with the job. Lu Luming's "Young Mistress's Fan" at Lanxin will be performed until the 8th. Now she is negotiating a contract to continue performing for half a month. If it is successfully resolved, she will prepare to present her proudest work, "Sunrise."

Lanxin is naturally a good place to perform dramas. After Huayi came down from Carlton, it negotiated with Lanxin, but there were many problems. Therefore, in order to maintain the contract with the actors that they would be paid a monthly salary for six months regardless of whether they performed or not, Huayi plans to open a dock. The destination is Nanjing, but this is opposed by the actors. It may be decided to wrong them a bit in the Queen's--that is, the matinee from Monday to Saturday.

After Huayi's contract with Carlton expired, it still belonged to Shanghai Art Troupe. The strength of the Shanghai Art Troupe actors is weak, so it cooperated with Li Jianwu's CZC and Huang Zuolin's Kugan. This reorganization immediately made a sensation in terms of momentum. Unexpectedly, not long after the reorganization, Li Jianwu quietly withdrew, and the actors naturally followed. Fortunately, Huang Zuolin and all the actors in Kugan signed a contract with Shanghai Art Troupe. As long as they don't cause trouble, it is enough to help.

After Li Jianwu left Shanghai Art Troupe, he planned to perform at Lanxin and wooed Xia Xia. Unfortunately, the negotiations failed. Now Xia Hu has decided to guest star in Lihua's self-written and directed "Widow's Courtyard" with a monthly salary of 2,000. Originally, Lihua's "Spring River Flower Moon Night" was suddenly banned, so there was no new play for a while, and the two sides naturally hit it off.

Since Xia Xia has a temporary home in the theater scene, the original plan to leave Shanghai has been canceled. At the same time, Han Fei, Sun Zhijun, Mao Yanhua, Mei Cun, Wang Jixu, and others decided to set off for the north within days to return to Shanghai in half a year. Unexpectedly, many people who came out of the Shanghai Art Troupe have become divided, which is truly unsettling.

Child star Chen Juanjuan, who has the appearance of a young girl, is pictured in a recent photograph.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jiazi

(9) Human Hell

A Ying said, "People are listening to you attentively, why don't you speak?" Little Zhuge laughed, "Are you not listening to me? We have to wait until late at night. What time is it now? It will be a while before it is late at night. What are you busy with?" This time, A Ying really hit Little Zhuge, lightly tapping him on the shoulder. Little Zhuge, as if returning to the topic, laughed, "Around ten o'clock, our four brothers will dress neatly and walk to Miss Bian. We will kneel down together. When she sees that we haven't bothered her for a long time, she will definitely ask us. The four of us will say that we beg Miss Bian to be merciful and tie our hands and feet with ropes. She will definitely ask us again. We will say that our brothers can't hold on any longer and want to sleep. Sleeping inside the room is not appropriate because there are men and women. Sleeping outside is even more inappropriate because we are afraid that the young lady will run away. We have no way to stop her. Please, young lady, be considerate of us." Miss Bian took pity on us and handed our hands and feet to us. This time's binding is different from the morning. In the morning, our hands and feet were tied together. This time, we will tie the left hand and left foot together with one rope, and the right hand and right foot together with another rope. Then, we will cover her face with a black cloth like the ones used for air defense. Then, we will place her on the brocade quilt and embroidered pillow. We brothers will be fine and leave the room together."

A Ying laughed, "Your Zhuge Liang is only limited in his cleverness. People who are more powerful than this have tried it. What's the use of getting her body if her heart is not willing?" Little Zhuge smoked his cigarette and laughed, "My words are not finished yet. After the cloth is arranged, please ask your younger brother to quietly walk into the room without waiting for Miss Bian's permission and consummate with her. This is called 'making the boat with wood and the rice into cooked rice.' I guessed Miss Bian's psychology. In this way, her body is Wei Shaoyun's. She will no longer follow Master Wei like a sheep, living a happy life, eating in comfort, and enjoying ready-made blessings. Is the King of Hell really her godfather? Does she have to seek death before she can rest?" A Ying and the others all nodded and smiled at the small birth. (End of this section) (193)
