### Two Hundred American Soldiers Repelled in Attack on Makin Island; Japanese General Headquarters Announced Yesterday

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today that approximately 200 American soldiers landed on Makin Island, the northernmost island of the Gilbert Islands, at dawn on June 17th. Despite the small number of Japanese defending troops, they were completely repelled. It is noted that the Gilbert Islands were occupied by Japanese forces at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. The British Gilbert Islands are located between the Japanese South Seas Mandate-controlled Marshall Islands and American Samoa, spanning from 4 degrees north latitude to 2 degrees south latitude, a total of sixteen islands with an area of approximately 430 square kilometers. Each island is formed from coral reefs approximately three meters above sea level. It is said that the islands were discovered between 1765 and 1848. In 1892, British Captain Davis declared the islands British territory. The islands currently have a population of approximately 26,000. The administrative headquarters are located on Tarawa, Butaritari, and Beru Islands, with Tarawa being the main island. The island is not only an excellent anchorage but also the center of administration and trade. All three islands have wireless telegraph stations. The main products are copra and coconuts.

### Allied Forces Attack Dieppe, Using Electric Tanks; Loaded with Explosives, Specializing in Destroying Bunkers; Roman Newspapers Believe British Will Try Again

Zurich, Switzerland, 20th (Havas) – The Neue Zürcher Zeitung today published a Berlin dispatch stating that British troops landed at the port of Dieppe yesterday and used new weapons. These new weapons are used by American troops and are small tank vehicles loaded with explosives, remotely controlled, and used to destroy bunkers. Once they touch a bunker, they explode. However, several were destroyed by German flat trajectory guns. In addition, British forces used new types of boats to land the tank vehicles, able to land one tank vehicle every seven to eight minutes.

Paris, 20th (Havas) – British forces landed in the Dieppe area of ​​northern France, resulting in 25 French deaths and 85 injuries. Some were killed or injured by stray bullets when British artillery bombarded the Dieppe area.

Lisbon, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from New York, American newspapers all published headlines about American troops participating in the Dieppe landing, and strongly emphasized General Marshall's prediction that American troops would land in Europe has now become a reality.

Rome, 20th (Havas) – The newspapers here devoted considerable space to detailing the British landing in the Dieppe area, stating that although Britain suffered a defeat, it is not impossible to launch a similar action again.

London, 20th (Havas) – An official communiqué was recently released stating that the attack on the port of Dieppe was not a large-scale offensive, and its scope did not exceed previous activities in the area. Allied troops landing in the area were tasked with destroying German artillery and German wireless receiving stations, because German lookout posts were very important for detecting the course of Allied escort merchant ships sailing along the southern coast of England. Therefore, the purpose of our army's landing this time was only to collect intelligence, and regaining prisoners was also part of our offensive policy. The German army recently transferred large numbers of troops to strengthen the coastal defenses of the occupied countries, which we had foreseen, so strong resistance was expected. However, our troops ignored the German resistance and were still able to land, and brought several tanks ashore. German wireless receiving stations and artillery positions were destroyed by our forces, and two small German warships were sunk. Many prisoners were rescued. Most of our troops were Canadians. Under the cover of the gunfire of our warships, they stayed ashore for eight hours. As for all the tanks that landed, they were ordered by headquarters to be destroyed before the infantry returned to their original ships and departed. Our air force covered American, Canadian, New Zealand, Polish, Czech, Norwegian, Belgian, and Free French troops fighting side by side, which was very successful. A large-scale air battle occurred in the area. Germany transferred all aircraft from the occupied areas of France and the two countries to the area to fight. Our country lost 98 aircraft, and Germany also lost 91 aircraft. The Royal Navy’s losses included one troop transport boat sunk. The destroyer HMS "Berkeley" was so badly damaged that it had to be scuttled by the sailors. All sailors and soldiers were rescued. The navy was commanded by Captain Hallett, and the army was commanded by Major General Robert. The Canadian army and all air forces were under the command of Air Marshal Mallory.

Berlin Announces Battle Results

Berlin, 20th (Havas) – Regarding the British landing in the Dieppe area of northern France, German military officials recently released the details and described it as the German army “displaying lightning defense." The general idea is that yesterday at dawn, sentries at the German coastal defense station suddenly heard sounds coming from the sea, and realized that the battle had already begun. Around 6:00 AM, the sentries saw a fleet of warships and fast boats heading towards the Dieppe area. The coast immediately opened fire, but the British released large amounts of smoke to cover the landing of infantry, tanks, and artillery. British artillery also opened fire on the port of Dieppe, and British bombers, protected by fighter planes, also fiercely bombed the area's defenses. At this point, German anti-aircraft guns and flat trajectory guns opened fire on warships carrying enemy troops, and barriers were placed on all roads. The enemy's tanks repeatedly attempted to enter the city but were unsuccessful. Within a few hours, all the British tanks that had landed were destroyed. The Canadian army attacked one of our artillery positions, and a fierce battle ensued. German artillerymen drew their bayonets and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy until the infantry arrived to reinforce them. By the afternoon, the British were finally forced to retreat. The enemy fleet encountered an attack by German light warships on its way back to England, and a total of three small British transport boats were sunk. Several gunboats were also damaged, and four enemy planes were shot down. Germany only lost one submarine destroyer.

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Yesterday, a German Foreign Ministry military spokesman, in answering questions about why the British army chose to land in Dieppe, said that the British army's choice to land in Dieppe clearly indicated an intention to invade the European continent, and was not just a trial for gathering information. The British army's purpose was to occupy the port as a starting point for offensive troops. The spokesman continued that the enemy lost approximately 900 men that day, and more details would be announced in the near future. Regarding questions about how American troops participated in the battle, the spokesman replied that it was difficult to distinguish between American, Canadian, and British troops during the fierce fighting.

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – This afternoon, the German military report corrected the number of British soldiers captured in the Dieppe battle, totaling 2,095, including 617 wounded. The German side initially announced only 1,500. The number of British aircraft shot down was also 121, not 112. The number of German aircraft lost was also 35, not 37.

### Germany Concentrates All Efforts on Southern Offensive; Threat to Stalingrad Greatly Increases; Fierce Fighting Also in Four Locations in Central Soviet Union

Bern, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The situation for Soviet troops continues to deteriorate at four key military battle lines in southern Soviet Union: northeast of Kletskaya and Kotelnikovo, south of Krasnodar, and southeast of Pyatigorsk. German forces have made progress in all four areas. According to the current situation, on the third day of the renewed all-out German offensive, a second German army crossed the Don River southeast of Kletskaya, about 40 miles from the Volga River where Stalingrad is located, greatly increasing the threat to the city. It is announced that this German army suffered heavy casualties, but the German armored units continue to attack gaps in the Soviet lines in an attempt to break through and attack Stalingrad. Superior German forces south of Krasnodar in northwestern Caucasus are also pressing the Soviet army and advancing on Novorossiysk (one of the remaining bases of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet) and the rear of Soviet forces in Grozny in two directions. At the same time, fierce fighting is also taking place on four important front lines in the central Soviet Union, stretching 400 miles from Bely to Lake Ilmen, and the scale has expanded. The areas where fighting is occurring are the Bely front, 210 miles southwest of Moscow; the salient in the Vyazma area, 130 miles west of Moscow; the salient in Kalinin and Rzhev, 130 miles northwest of Moscow; and the Lake Ilmen front south of Leningrad. Soviet sources are vague about the fighting in the central region, only stating that Germany is exerting its greatest strength to carry out offensives in the Don River bend and the Caucasus.

Soviet Troops Fight Tenaciously to Defend Stalingrad

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Havas) – As the German-Soviet war approaches fourteen months, German forces besieging Stalingrad have made further progress in the past 24 hours. A unit departing from the city of Zhutovo, 30 miles northeast of Kotelnikovo, has driven Soviet troops back to the Volga River. According to Berlin sources, this German army has even reached the vicinity of the river. Most of the Stalingrad garrison is concentrated between the Volga and Don rivers and is now in an increasingly precarious situation. Moscow has admitted that German forces have crossed the Don River near Kalach and are strengthening their bridgehead. Moscow Radio also announced yesterday that German forces launched a large-scale offensive in the Kletskaya area with 100 tanks and 20 aircraft, and 2,000 men were killed in action. The fighting is still ongoing. Soviet troops launched several counterattacks and even regained one strongpoint. In short, the tenacity with which Soviet troops are defending Stalingrad is beyond the expectations of neutral observers, as the battle for Stalingrad has lasted for weeks, and it is unknown who will emerge victorious. As for the fighting in the Caucasus, neither side has released any battle reports, but this does not mean that there is no fighting on the front lines.

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Soviet troops in the Stalingrad area attempted to cross the Don River to the west but were unsuccessful. Between the Don and Volga rivers, Soviet military traffic exists only through a "corridor" several kilometers wide, which is the only communication line and lifeline between the central and southern Soviet armies. Soviet troops are fighting bravely and unwilling to give up. Yesterday, German aircraft assisted ground forces southwest of Stalingrad, bombing enemy railways and other transportation facilities. Ships on the lower reaches of the Volga River were the main targets of the bombing. One ship was sunk, and another was damaged. Soviet troops in the Rzhev area have largely lost their fighting spirit. Soviet troops north of Orel are stubbornly resisting, and the dense forests mean that the fighting German troops are all infantry.

### German-Soviet Battle Reports

German Headquarters, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – This afternoon's German military report stated that German and allied forces in the Caucasus area continue to advance. A transport ship in the Kerch Strait was hit and set on fire by anti-aircraft guns. In the Sea of Azov, a German minesweeper sank two Soviet armored gunboats. Several Soviet attempts to cross the Don River were unsuccessful. Three transport ships on the Volga River were sunk by German aircraft, and one was damaged. Enemy troops near Vyazma and Rzhev have repeatedly concentrated, preparing for action, and were broken up by our aircraft and heavy artillery fire. Enemy troops trapped southeast of Lake Ilmen fought for several days and were finally annihilated. Enemy attacks on bridgeheads in the Volga River and Leningrad areas were unsuccessful. In the Gulf of Finland, German aircraft sank one enemy minesweeper and heavily damaged another. In the past two days, Finnish aircraft sank two Soviet submarines. Last night, Soviet aircraft bombed eastern Germany, dropping several bombs on Warsaw, killing and injuring several civilians.

Moscow, 20th (Havas) – This radio station announced today that in the past 24 hours, our troops have conducted defensive battles in the Krasnaya area, northeast of Kotelnikovo, southeast of Pyatigorsk, and south of Krasnodar. In the area south of Krasnodar, the enemy forces are numerous, and our army was forced to retreat. There have been no major changes on the other front lines.

### Sixth Brazilian Ship Sunk; President Orders Detention of German Immigrants; Chilean Ambassador Protests to Germany

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Domei News Agency) – According to news from the Brazilian capital, after the announcement of the sinking of the sixth Brazilian ship, Brazilian President Vargas immediately ordered the detention of all German immigrants on the exchange ships Baquiá and Cuyabá as hostages, with only German diplomats not being detained. These two ships were already full of German immigrants, ready to sail to Lisbon at the beginning of this week to exchange Brazilian citizens. However, the departure was stopped due to the sinking of the fifth Brazilian ship by a submarine. The sixth Brazilian ship announced to have sunk yesterday was the coastal ship Jacyara, which was sunk off the northeast coast of Brazil, and the people on board were ordered to escape in lifeboats. According to shipping sources in the Brazilian capital, another Axis submarine was seen in the western South Atlantic yesterday. At the same time, the Brazilian government has not yet issued a statement regarding the sinking of the ships. Its only response was the order issued yesterday by the Brazilian President to detain German immigrants.

New York, 20th (Havas) – According to news from the Brazilian capital, the small cruiser "Bahia" was torpedoed and sunk near the port of Itacaré in the state of Bahia. At 11:00 this morning, an Axis submarine was spotted on the sea off the state of Bahia and was attacked by patrol aircraft. The Brazilian government has decided to bombard Axis submarines with aircraft and send patrol ships to search everywhere, as a response to the Axis submarines attacking Brazilian coastal shipping. According to the "Evening Post", "a state of war almost exists." However, the police in the Brazilian capital are still ordered to stop all anti-Axis demonstrations. Military patrols are constantly on the streets of the capital. At the same time, all newspapers prominently publish the news of two Axis submarines being sunk.

Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Havas) – After the repeated attacks on Brazilian ships by German submarines, the Chilean ambassador to Germany has been ordered to protest to the German government, stating that the attack on South American allies by Germany has a direct impact on Chile, so it has to lodge a serious protest with Germany.

Rio de Janeiro, 20th (Havas) – The authorities had previously declared martial law due to student demonstrations here. Now that order has been restored, the order has been revoked.

Rio de Janeiro, 20th (Havas) – It is learned that President Vargas, fearing that Brazilian citizens will be detained by the Germans in the occupied areas of France (Biaritz?), will only allow German diplomats to evacuate in the future, and the rest of the diaspora will have to remain in Brazil as hostages.

### Willkie to Visit Soviet Union and Near East Within Three Weeks; Said to Have "Special Mission"; Has Discussed Everything with Roosevelt

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Domei News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, Republican figure Willkie announced yesterday that he will visit the Soviet Union and the Near East in a few weeks. Although the purpose of this trip was not stated, it is undoubtedly of an official nature. Before announcing this intention, Willkie met with Secretary of State Hull and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Maisky. He had dinner with President Roosevelt yesterday afternoon.

Washington, 20th (Havas) – Republican leader and former presidential candidate Willkie said recently that he would undertake a "special mission of the government" and travel to the Near East and the Soviet Union within the next three weeks. Willkie had lunch with President Roosevelt at the White House today, and they probably discussed the detailed arrangements for the trip to the war zone.

Lisbon, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from Washington, Willkie announced yesterday that he will depart for the Soviet Union, the Near East, India, and China in a few weeks to carry out tasks entrusted by President Roosevelt. He met with Roosevelt yesterday to discuss the visit plan.

Washington, 21st (Havas) – Republican figure Willkie gave a speech to the American people here today, stating that the United States is in danger of immediate defeat in this war, and most Americans do not seem to understand this. The reason for this is that Americans have not prepared to sacrifice gasoline for military use like the people of other countries, or put their personal interests aside for the sake of the country. If we want to defeat others, we must fight for our ideals and sacrifice our lives. There are quite a few people among us who believe that this war will be won by the number of aircraft, artillery, and various weapons manufactured. However, if preparedness in production is not complemented by a spirit of national sacrifice, we will not be able to win.

American Troops Stationed in Iraq

Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Havas) – The Basler Nachrichten recently published a dispatch from the capital of Turkey stating that American troops recently landed in the Persian Gulf and were transferred to northern Iraq via the city of Mosul, the capital of Iraq, to replace the British Tenth Army. A portion of the British Tenth Army has been sent to the Egyptian front to reinforce it.

Ankara, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports, American troops are stationed in Iraq for the first time. The troops have landed in Basra and passed through Baghdad and Kirkuk. The American Minister to Iraq paid a special visit to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry and made a statement, stating that the arrival of American troops in Iran is as friends of the Iraqi people and does not interfere with Iraqi sovereignty. As soon as the war ends, American troops will withdraw. Political figures believe that the renewed arrival of American troops to be stationed in Iraq is related to the Moscow Conference.

Ankara, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports from Damascus, General Eaker of the American Air Force has arrived in Syria and is observing airfields in the Syrian-Turkish border and the Tripoli area, presumably as a prelude to the American military taking over these airfields.

### Major Changes Coming in the Middle East

Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Havas) – The Basler Nachrichten recently stated that the London press is heavily commenting on the replacement of General Auchinleck, commander-in-chief of the British forces in Egypt, and the Anglo-American-Soviet negotiations in Moscow. As for the former, the event was abrupt, and some quarters were deeply surprised and even expressed indignation. It is widely believed that major events are about to occur in the Middle East. The military authority of the new commander-in-chief of the Middle East forces, General Alexander, seems to be far greater than that of Auchinleck. There is currently a tendency in London military circles to regard the positions in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, India, and southern Soviet Union as a single battlefield. It is not impossible for British troops to go to the Caucasus via Iraq and Iran to assist in the fighting. As for the latter, it is widely believed that Churchill agreed to expand aid to the Soviet Union during his meeting with Stalin, not only in terms of armaments, but also by shipping various raw materials, especially food, to the Soviet Union, because food is scarce after the Soviet Union lost most of its agricultural areas. Churchill also assured Stalin that the British Air Force would step up its bombing of Germany. It is heard that during the first meeting, Churchill reported on the current strength of the British army and the recent strategic measures taken by the British General Headquarters, and did not attempt to conceal the severity of the situation. During the second meeting, Stalin reported on the Soviet situation, and Harryman, representing US President Roosevelt, made a presentation on the future of US military production. The last meeting was to draft a joint plan.

Ankara, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – The semi-official Turkish newspaper Ulus commented on the Moscow Conference, stating that the Egyptian theater, or the so-called Second Front, will become increasingly important. The new commander-in-chief of the British Middle East forces, General Alexander, has drafted a new plan to shift the center of military operations in the Near East. This was discussed at the Moscow Conference, and Stalin has expressed his agreement with the plan. Alexander's appointment to the new position is due to this.

Cairo, 20th (Havas) – The British Middle East Command released a battle report stating that there was continued reconnaissance activity on the Egyptian front on the night of the 18th of this month, and the air force was also very active. Our fighter planes shot down four enemy planes.

### Important Meeting Held at the White House

Washington, 21st (Havas) – An important military meeting was held at the White House today, chaired by President Roosevelt. Attendees included Admiral Cunningham, representative of the British Admiralty, chiefs of staff of the Allied countries, Admiral King, commander-in-chief of the US Navy, Brigadier General Fiske, and Hopkins, special commissioner for the implementation of Lend-Lease. The meeting lasted half an hour and is reported to have discussed issues related to the supply of military goods. No communiqué was issued afterward.

### All-India Muslim League Meeting Concludes, Issues Lengthy Resolution

Rangoon, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - It is learned here that the Executive Committee of the All-India Muslim Association held a meeting in Bombay, which concluded yesterday. The results of the meeting are unknown, but it is expected that a communique will be issued today to announce them.

Lisbon, 21st (Allied News Agency) - According to a New Delhi dispatch, the Executive Committee of the All-India Muslim League, which opened on the 16th, passed a lengthy resolution on the afternoon of the 20th, clarifying the Muslim League's attitude towards the National Congress Party's non-cooperation movement. The main content of the resolution is as follows: Our country's concerns are all focused on the hopes of the 100 million Muslims in India, to realize the plan for the separation of India and Pakistan. In order to establish a provisional government, the Muslim League will not hesitate to negotiate with any political party, nor will it spare any cooperation. However, the Muslim League will not tolerate threats or coercive interference from any party and vows to do its best to protect the lives and property of Muslims.

Disturbances Continue in Madras

Bombay, 24th (Havas News Agency) - According to Reuters, serious incidents occurred again in Madras yesterday. An official announcement also admitted that in the Ahiweden area, crowds attacked police stations and prisons. The residence of a British official once caught fire and burned. The police opened fire to disperse the crowds, but the number of casualties is still unknown. In addition, all schools, large, medium, and small, in Patna have been suspended.

### Soviet Planes Attack Poland

Berlin, 21st (Allied News Agency) - It was announced here today that Soviet planes flew to Poland last night and attacked. The bombed areas include East Prussia, Posen, and Upper Silesia, which suffered minor damage.

### "Flying Fortresses" Attack Northern France

Lisbon, 21st (Allied Press) - According to a London dispatch, about 500 British fighter planes escorted several American "Flying Fortresses" last night to attack the Amiens railway factory in northern France. The bombed area extended from Le Havre harbor to Furnes, north of Dunkirk.

### Canadian Prime Minister's Broadcast Address: Allied Crisis is Serious

Ottawa, 20th (Havas News Agency) - Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently delivered a broadcast address to the nation, stating that the crisis faced by the Allies and Canada has not only not lessened but has become increasingly serious in recent weeks. The people of the country must make active efforts. Regarding the labor shortage in our country, the government has drafted relief measures, that is, all unnecessary work will be limited to the use of the minimum amount of labor. In addition, efforts should be made to improve work efficiency. Furthermore, the selection of new occupations by workers and the dismissal of workers by employers should be restricted.

### From Lecturing to Imprisonment (4)

— Tie Ming

Life is very unpredictable. When I was a teenager, I studied at Tsinghua Garden outside Beiping—then called Beijing—long before Tsinghua was changed to a university. All the training had an American flavor. Every afternoon there was an hour of so-called "compulsory exercise," when all the school buildings were closed, and all the students were driven to the athletic field in front of the Roosevelt Memorial Gymnasium. The teacher in charge was Ma John. Readers may know his name, but at that time he was only famous for running 440 yards well. I learned American baseball on the athletic field. This kind of ball game has not yet become popular in our country, but I have always liked it. Although I play it ordinarily, I can catch the hard ball effortlessly and throw it quickly and accurately. During the years I studied in the United States, I also used my free time to throw baseballs. At Ai Qun Girls' High School, I often taught female students to play softball. This is really a small game, not a skill, but practice makes perfect, and this time it saved my life. No sooner said than done! I saw a dark, slippery ball flying towards me, knew something was wrong, and immediately instinctively caught it with my hand. At this moment, a person's senses and thoughts are extraordinarily sharp. On the one hand, I saw that what I had caught was a small bomb with a very short wooden handle, and the fuse was burning, with only a short section left; on the other hand, I saw a person rushing out of the door to a car on the side of the road. I took the bomb and ran outside. For my age, I ran very fast. Six years ago, I won first place in the 100-meter dash for faculty and staff at the National Zhejiang University sports meet. The person in the car probably expected me to run out, so they shot at me as soon as I reached the door. Fortunately, I was blessed by the stars and was not hit. Later, I found out that the bullet made two holes in my British raincoat, which cost five pounds, but it injured the fat old female custodian behind me. By this time, the car had begun to move, but I thought that he and the driver had not expected me to play baseball. At that time, the fuse of the bomb was almost burned out, so I aimed at the front seat of the car and threw it, and at the same time immediately threw myself on the ground—this was a trick I learned during military training. As soon as I fell to the ground, there was a bang, and the bomb exploded. The person who fired the gun was about to jump out of the car, but was injured by shrapnel and fell on the sidewalk. The driver did not dodge in time, was blown into the air, and fell down, conveniently filling his own vacancy. At this time, the car had crashed into a lamppost and started to burn.

I got up, took off running, and as I passed the assassin lying on the ground, I kicked him in the head with all my strength, and seemed to hear a crisp sound from his skull. I didn't necessarily want to kill anyone, but he wanted to kill me, so I had to return the favor in self-defense. I really hoped that he had been kicked to death, or at least stunned unconscious and lost all memory, so that perhaps no one else would know that I was with Martin.

I had caused a big disaster! I ran frantically, trying to find my way into the small alleys. The burning car lit up the surrounding area. After turning two corners, I looked back each time to see if anyone was chasing me, and then I deliberately slowed down. Looking at the street sign, I realized that I was just on Rue de Flandres. I didn't know where Martin had gone. My fate was really good, and I just happened to catch a public bus bound for Chatelet in the center of the city. This kind of bus only runs once an hour after midnight. I got off at the stop before reaching the terminus, deliberately took a long way around, and after circling around several times, I knew that no one was following me, and then I walked back to my hotel.

I didn't sleep well. I have had quite a few wandering experiences in my life, but I have never experienced such an extraordinary situation. I don't care what happened to Martin. People didn't kill me; but I may have already blown someone up or kicked them to death. Won't the Paris police be looking for me? And the Maintenance Society is secretly plotting against me! I planned for a long time before settling on a self-defense strategy. At that time, I was really exhausted, but as I was falling asleep, I suddenly remembered that I had drunk the wine for free and hadn't paid, and I felt very sorry.

It was also my good fortune that this happened in France. If it were in England, everyone would know at a glance that I was not Chinese or Japanese. But not in France. The ideals of equality, fraternity, and the hospitable and affectionate nature, as well as the cheap cost of living in recent years, have long made France a paradise for travelers. Not only do foreigners living in France account for almost half of the country's population, but the races and nationalities are especially complete. In some places in England, I was often followed by a group of children, and when I attended the first group meeting (Kommission I der Internationalen Bodenkundlichen Gesellschaft) of the International Soil Science Society in Bangor, North Wales, I especially felt the novelty of the local villagers. The female shop assistants would often gather in the glass window, one spreading to two, and two spreading to three, pointing and gesticulating at me, their surprised expressions being just like those of a child who had come to the zoo for the first time to see a monkey somersaulting, the only difference being that the child was looking from outside the cage and they were looking from inside. In France, no one ever paid special attention to me, and the French did not feel any interest in analyzing and studying the backgrounds of these foreigners. So the owner of an art store near the Gare du Nord in Paris initially guessed that I was Italian, and when I said no, he said that I must be English. In the small town of Bagneres de Bigorre in the Pyrenees, a barber guessed that I was Moroccan, and on Pio du Midi, climbing the mountain from Bagneres towards the Spanish border, I met an old woman selling postcards, who told me that two of my compatriots had bought many of her postcards, and she was willing to bet that they were indeed Hungarians.

### Authorities of Two Concessions Confer on Air Defense Preparedness, Announcement of Regulations on Lighting Control and Alert

The Shanghai District Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters announced yesterday (21st) morning that the Shanghai lighting control alert exercise will be conducted for the first time on August 25 (Tuesday) from 7:30 PM to 11:30 PM.

First Lighting Control Exercise

This is part of the city's air defense preparedness. However, this type of exercise will only be conducted on Tuesdays, not every day. The start and end of the lighting control alert will be announced by radio station XQHA. As for the regulations on lighting control, the spokesperson of the Air Defense Headquarters previously announced the following: Decorative lights, hanging lights, store window lights, and other similar lights should be extinguished. The lighting inside the house should be reduced in intensity, or black cloth or curtains should be hung on the windows, or the lights should be covered with lampshades to completely block the light.

French Authorities Visit Air Defense Director

In addition, Lieutenant Colonel Faber, Chief of the French Concession Police, Mr. Boussod, Director of the French Fire Department, Mr. Baroutte, Director of the French Health Department, and Mr. Baugon, Director of the French Public Works Department, visited Mr. Matsumoto Goro, Assistant Director of the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Public Concession Police Department yesterday morning. The meeting began at 10:00 AM, discussing lighting control and other air defense measures. It is believed that as a result of the talks, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council will simultaneously strengthen air defense measures.

### Issuance of Identification Cards, Strict Prohibition of Soliciting Bribes

The identification cards for citizens of the French Concession, except for a portion that has been approved for issuance, have not been issued for the most part. This is because the French authorities have repeatedly received secret reports that some unscrupulous Baojia (neighborhood security organizations) are taking the opportunity to solicit bribes, which is illegal and should be strictly investigated to maintain law and order. Therefore, the French authorities have ordered the police to send personnel to secretly investigate and punish severely.

### Restriction on the Use of Flour, Announcement of Eighth Ration, Flour Sales Suspended

Regarding the restriction on the use of flour, the provisions in the notice published by the authorities on February 5 of this year remain in effect, that is:

Bread

Candy

It is forbidden to make candy with wheat flour or rice flour.

Pastries

At that time, each coupon will be sold by the rice shop with the registered number marked on the coupon, with one and a half liters of white rice and half a liter of broken corn, for a total price of four yuan and five jiao. Flour sales will be suspended.

### Authorities Continue to Punish Shops Violating Regulations

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that the public concession, the French concession, and the Shanghai West Municipal Authorities continue to actively crack down on profiteering by stores. From August 1st to 15th, the Bureau's investigation and price control offices sent personnel to investigate stores 2,288 times. At the same time, the French Concession Police Department investigated 1,453 stores. The Bureau's price control office summoned 414 stores that were deemed to have violated price control regulations to the Bureau for questioning. The French Concession authorities summoned 148 stores in violation to the police station to state reasons why they should not be punished. As a result, 46 stores in the public concession were determined by the Price Control Committee to have violated the regulations and were ordered to close down. The period of suspension depended on the severity of the circumstances, but they were allowed to pay a fine instead. Department stores within the concession were also punished separately for violations. At the same time, the French Concession Police Department punished 113 stores.

### Loans Secured by Goods, 60% of Assessed Value, Must Be Immediately Salable, Term Not Exceeding Ten Days

The Bank Joint Reserve Committee, in order to adjust the funds of its member banks and handle interbank lending, and to prevent hoarding for profit and avoid fueling speculation for loans secured by goods, has decided that the lending committee will strictly handle the matter. It is stipulated that the collateral for lending, such as goods, is limited to those that can be sold immediately in this city, and the purpose of possession by the owner is limited to those who do not hoard for profit. The total evaluation of the goods provided by each bank shall not exceed 25% of the total amount of lending approved by the committee for each bank. At the same time, the valuation discount for goods that can be sold immediately is calculated at 60% of the assessed price. The lending period shall not exceed ten days at most, but early repayment is allowed.

### Public Entertainment Venues Allowed to Delay Closing Under Certain Conditions, Closing Time Extended to Midnight, But Air Defense and Electricity Consumption Must Comply with Regulations

If anyone is found to be operating privately between 12:00 AM and 6:00 AM the next morning, they will be ordered to close down immediately, and their license will be permanently revoked without further warning. The approval for extending the closing time of public venues this time is conditional on the venue's ability to strictly comply with the air defense rules announced by the authorities from time to time, and not to exceed its electricity allocation.

### Conversion of Rent to New Currency, Difficult to Determine Reason, Wide Disparity in Rent Levels, Difficult to Be Uniform Considering Both Reason and Sentiment

The issue of converting rent to the new currency has evolved to this point, and due to its prolonged duration, its attractiveness has diminished, but the inherent crisis has instead shown signs of increasing day by day. The disputes between landlords and tenants that have been seen recently, tracing their origins, are also due to the difference in opinions on the method of converting rent to the new currency. Recently, our reporter inquired with the relevant authorities about the ins and outs of this matter, as well as the possibility of official regulations for a unified rate for converting to the new currency. On the surface, the municipal authorities are strictly silent on the solution to this issue. In reality, the discussions and deliberations of the relevant parties have not yet reached a decision. Banks, real estate departments, real estate companies, and housing rental agencies are currently deciding on their own conversion rates.

Difficulties Encountered in Consultations by the Authorities

The difficulties encountered by the relevant authorities in consulting on this issue are as mentioned above. The emergence of these difficulties does not lie in the issue of converting to the new currency itself, but because there are too many issues involved in all aspects. First, the rent in Shanghai itself has always been unfair. For the same equipment and the same size house, some charge tips and key money, and the rent is calculated in hundreds of yuan, while others do not charge tips and the rent is only tens of yuan. In terms of the current standard of living, the latter landlords suffer too much, while for the former, it is not an exaggeration to pay savings certificates at a rate of two to one, and even there are houses without sanitary equipment, where the water bill is paid by the landlord, but the sub-landlord installs a bathtub privately, then it is even more difficult to decide. Second, there has never been a unified standard to follow for rent within the concessions. For example, the head landlord may or may not provide water to the sub-landlord, and the sub-landlord may or may not provide water and electricity to the sub-tenants. Especially in apartment buildings, the public water and electricity bills are either shared, or borne by the head landlord. If there is heating in winter, it is either provided, or a separate fee must be paid. The situation is so complex that it is difficult to find a fair and impartial method for converting rent to the new currency for both landlords and tenants. Third, after using the new savings certificates, some sub-landlords pay the rent to the head landlord, either fully in the new currency, or converted at a discount of 60% to 70%. If a consistent method is stipulated in the future, should those who have paid less be required to make up the difference, and should those who have paid more be deducted or refunded when paying rent in the future? There are many technical considerations in this matter. Fourth, before the official order to use the new savings certificates, some head landlords stipulated that rent should be paid in savings certificates, which is not uncommon in the French Concession. How should this matter be remedied? It also takes a lot of trouble.

Water Bill May Be Stipulated to Be Shared

According to well-informed sources related to the rent issue, the above four points are indeed difficulties, but they are not insurmountable. Taking water supply as an example, in order to simplify the issue, the authorities may stipulate that sub-tenants share the tap water bill when issuing a unified method in the future, and the rent is paid in savings certificates according to regulations. The second and third items are at best purely technical issues, and only the procedures are considered.

### Water Cut-Off Dispute Resolved in Houses on Avenue Joffre

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reported that after the *Shanghai Times* first revealed the truth about the residents of No. 11, Lane 1270, Avenue Joffre being cut off from the water supply by the landlord before the evening of the 2nd, it is now learned that water supply to these houses, which had been cut off for a whole month, was restored yesterday afternoon. The head landlord of these houses, whose representative is French lawyer Blandin, started to implement the water cut-off on July 20 because the five sub-landlords refused to increase the rent. The supply was not restored until 4:15 PM yesterday afternoon, because Blandin had obtained the signing of a reconciliation agreement from the sub-landlords, and the final agreement was that the sub-landlords should pay a monthly rent of 180 yuan, including the water bill.

### Wu Zhongyi Passes Away

Mr. Wu Zhongyi, a famous reporter, served in the news industry for many years, worked as an editor for various newspapers, worked diligently, and achieved remarkable results. He suddenly suffered from heart disease last winter and moved back to his hometown this spring to recuperate. His condition improved sometimes, but not others. At the end of June, his legs began to swell, and then his abdomen became distended. He was admitted to Wujin Hospital for treatment in early July. The doctor diagnosed him with heart enlargement. He felt slightly better after releasing water, but then deteriorated again. He passed away at 5:00 PM on August 4 at the young age of 37. Mr. Wu has parents over 60 years old, no brothers, and leaves behind five children, one son and four daughters, the son only being eight years old. Mr. Wu had no permanent property, and his income from writing had been exhausted on medical expenses. After his death, his relatives and friends helped to raise money for his funeral and burial at the Fangsheng Temple in the north of Changzhou City, his hometown. Now, his friend Mr. Yan E-sheng is publishing a notice in the newspaper on his behalf to inform all friends, hoping that everyone will contribute generously so that the elderly can be supported and the young can be educated. Donations will be collected by the News Paper Social Service Column and the Changzhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai at No. 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road.

### *Shen Bao* Middle School Group Scholarship, Deadline for Collection

The approved lists of the *Shen Bao* reader scholarship elementary school group, middle school group, and tutoring group have been published successively. Yesterday was the first day for the middle school group to start making payments. Many students who received assistance came to collect the money. Students who have not collected the money must come to collect it within one week. Also, yesterday the newspaper received letters from East Asia Middle School, setting up 60 half-fee scholarships, and Guanyu Middle School, setting up 20 free and half-fee scholarships. The Jinxiu Vocational Tutoring School set up 400 reduced-fee scholarships, with each student receiving a subsidy of five yuan per subject. The letters from the schools are recorded below for application purposes.

East Asia Letter

Yesterday, a letter was received from Shanghai East Asia Middle School, located at No. 80, Hualong Road, Shenhua Vocational Education Society, stating: "We believe that your newspaper is enthusiastic about education and has repeatedly held education scholarships. Thousands of impoverished children have benefited and been able to continue their studies. However, the more people who are rescued, the more people who look forward to it. Therefore, among the students who took the exam for your newspaper this year, there must be many who have excellent grades but failed due to quota limitations. Our school admires your newspaper's good intentions in helping impoverished students and has specially set up 60 half-fee scholarships in each grade, 35 in the first grade of junior high school, and five each in the second, third, first, second, and third grades of senior high school. Please select and recommend the best students and ask them to report to the school before August 30. We are deeply grateful for your help." (Note: The half-fee tuition for junior high school is 55 yuan, and the half-fee tuition for senior high school is 65 yuan. If there are impoverished students who have been approved by this newspaper, we will introduce them to the school.)

Guanyu Letter

Guanyu Middle School wrote: "We are writing to inform you that our school has set up 40 free and half-fee scholarships in response to your newspaper's scholarship, and we are writing to ask your newspaper to recommend students. Our school previously received donations from enthusiastic people in the community for a total of 60 free and half-fee scholarships and held an exam a few days ago. Now there are still more than 20 places left. Our school has specially raised enough to make 40 places, divided into four classes in the first and second grades of senior and junior high school, with five free and five half-fee places in each class. Admission without examination is allowed, or those who have not taken the scholarship exam for your newspaper but are unable to afford school can also register for the exam at our school. If you support us, please select and recommend students before September 1. First come, first served, until the quota is filled. Sincerely, Private Guanyu Middle School." (The school address is No. 16, New Market, Muer Ming Road, Jing'an Temple Road. The half-fee is 95 yuan. If there are impoverished students who wish to enter the school and have been approved by this newspaper, we will immediately introduce them to the school.)

Will to Help Students

Madam Zhao, the mother of Yao Ding-sheng, was the virtuous wife of the martyr Yao Ding-sheng. She assisted her husband in teaching her children since he was alive, and did not refuse to work hard. Therefore, her children, such as the brothers Yao Bohua, Yao Zhongba, Yao Yongli, Yao Yongzheng, and Yao Yongji, are outstanding talents, either specializing in agriculture, working in banks, practicing law, or heading medical schools, and are well-known at the time. She paid attention to education throughout her life, and especially cared about children who lost the ability to study. Therefore, when she was dying, she repeatedly instructed her children that if anything unfortunate happened, they must save funeral expenses to help children who have dropped out of school. Unexpectedly, she was old and her energy was waning, and she died of illness on August 21 at midnight in her Shanghai residence. Her children followed her will and, in addition to holding a funeral in accordance with etiquette at the Paradise Funeral Home, they did not dare to disturb relatives and friends. All the funeral expenses saved were transferred to elementary school scholarships. It is also to fulfill the will of the deceased, and therefore to benefit children who have dropped out of school.

### Strictly Prohibiting the Collection of Tips for Renting Houses; Security Deposits Should Be Clearly Stated in Writing; Otherwise, the Sale of Furniture Cannot Be Considered Justified and Should Be Based on Market Price

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department announced that the Council recently issued Announcement No. 6051, reiterating the previous order regarding the prohibition of tips. The announcement stated that anyone demanding or receiving a price exceeding the normal market value before renting or subletting a house is in violation of regulations and may be subject to fines or imprisonment. Regarding the sale of furniture and decorations, if the price is deemed higher than the normal market value, interested parties should request an appraiser to estimate the value. Anyone possessing evidence and willing to report the aforementioned violations may submit it to the Office for Implementing Subletting License Regulations, Room 374, Council Building, 209 Jiangxi Road. Security deposits, etc., collected as guarantees for rent, shall not be considered legitimate unless it is clearly stated that they can be used to offset future rent or be returned at the end of the lease. If tenants have any doubts about security deposits being secretly used as tips, or encounter excessively high prices for furniture and decorations, they should consult the Office for Implementing Subletting License Regulations for all inquiries.

Gift of Wheat Coupons

Our newspaper received a letter yesterday from Mr. Pu Qiting, stating, "I am sending one hundred wheat coupons from the Three Religions Morality and Charity Association, each worth two pounds of American wheat, to be distributed among the top one hundred students who passed the examination for the primary school scholarship from your newspaper, to encourage them and wish them good health, diligent study, and future glory for the country. I am immensely pleased. Pu Qiting, 21st." (Note: The primary school scholarships have been distributed since the 17th, and only a small portion remains unclaimed. They will be distributed according to the list, and the remainder will be given to needy students in junior high school. We express our gratitude to Mr. Pu.)

### Why Uniquely Suppress Chinese Stocks?

— Blunt Iron

The restrictions on Chinese stocks in the lending measures issued by the Bank Union Reserve Committee (see this newspaper on the 16th) are considered not only overly cautious but also somewhat unfair. The Reserve Committee's valuation is naturally a prudent comparison based on the market price of the object, followed by a discount to ensure protection. However, the regulation that the valuation of Chinese stocks should not exceed their face value is an excessive suppression. Many Chinese companies were newly established, but many old ones also exist. Due to the recent surge in prices, the value of their assets and raw materials has increased sharply, and the value of their shares has naturally increased several times. Why should this be singled out for suppression? The value of real estate, based on the original valuation, has long been inconsistent with the market price, so the Bank Union does not adopt the Council's valuation but sets its own. However, the face value of shares in companies established before the war does not adequately reflect the actual asset value of the shares today, just like the land valuation register does not reflect the current value of real estate. Why is one not taken as a standard while the other is taken as an absolute standard? Government bonds currently have no interest to collect in Shanghai, but their market value is still between 80% and 90% of their face value, yet the Bank Union only values them at 70%. Isn't this much more preferential than Chinese stocks? Although company bonds have more legal protection than company shares, if the company is in poor condition and the share price falls, the bonds are also at risk. Why is it sufficient to calculate bonds at only 60%? Instantly salable goods, so-called "instantly," must still take at least a day or two to complete the transaction, and buyers also require a considerable amount of time to find and negotiate. Although Chinese stocks do not yet have a formal market, they are openly bought and sold by many stock companies. In fact, their potential for immediate monetization is much higher than that of all goods and real estate. Why are goods calculated at 60%? It is assumed that the Bank Union has not carefully considered the above points.

Since the suspension of foreign stocks, Chinese stocks have begun to attract the attention of Shanghai residents, and the enterprises run by Chinese people have felt a considerable incentive. Although this move by the Bank Union still cannot stop the original interest of those investing in Chinese stocks, and they are willing to buy Chinese stocks at a high price, it is not for speculation, but because they have their own investment goals.

### Multi-Party Bids Are Not Weak; Government Bonds Want to Soften but Stop

Yesterday, the unified government bond market fluctuated, and the trend seemed more chaotic. Although large investors were selling at high prices, the willingness of buyers was quite strong, so the market price wanted to soften but stopped, and was eventually held up by the bulls. In the morning, various banks continued to enter the market, continuing the demand from the previous day. Each bond was firm, and Grade C bonds rose uniquely by four cents, and initially rose to 9.40 yuan due to the scarcity of supply from sellers. Grade A rose to a high of 40.05 yuan, but later weakened again due to continued selling by large investors, but the footing was steady and there was no special sign of softening. The reason why the market price has fallen as soon as it rises in recent days is entirely due to the obstruction of large investors taking profits. Grade C bonds were particularly affected. For example, ten days ago, when the market price of Grade A was around 40.05 yuan, Grade B was only 9.60 yuan, and Grade C was higher than Grade B at 9.90 yuan. Now Grade A has reached 40.06 yuan, Grade B is already 9.10 yuan, and Grade C is only 8.80 yuan. Since the beginning of June, Grades B and C have rarely separated, and sometimes Grade C is higher than Grade B. From this, it can be seen that if the outflow of large investors stops, the market sentiment may be more upward. The total transaction volume was about 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A list is attached:

### Chinese Stocks Are Easy to Suppress and Difficult to Rise; Market Prices Flow Downstream

Yesterday's Chinese stock market was still in a dismal downward trend. Although wealthy investors were buying at low prices, it was difficult to reverse the trend of suppression that has been going on for 27 days (excluding Sundays). Market prices flowed downstream. In particular, the Yong'an Company in the department store industry once broke through the 100 yuan mark, seeing a low price of 98 yuan, a huge drop of more than 70 yuan compared to the market price a month ago. The price has risen too much, so the so-called "rise high, fall hard." Later it stabilized and still squeezed a small amount of three yuan around the 100 yuan mark. The New New Company also saw a small fall. Bingyi slightly decreased by 2.5 cents. Cultural stocks rebounded after falling, Shangwu Book Hall down 5 yuan, Zhonghua down 2.5 yuan, and Shijie was the only one unchanged. Buyers raised the price of New Pharmaceutical and New Asia again, seeing a low price of 41.5 yuan, and finally squeezed to a flat price. Zhongfa Minyi fell slightly by 1 yuan to 5 yuan. Zhabei Water and Electricity slightly fell by 2.5 cents. Huashang Electric fell by 7.5 cents. Greater China Match fell again by 4 yuan, entering within 180 yuan, a huge drop of 10 yuan in three days. Nanyang Tobacco's progress was watched, down 3.5 yuan, and the rest were half-tired. The transaction volume was quite lively. The market prices of various stocks are listed below:

### Factory Urging Out Warehouse Rent; Leading Fine Cloth Plummets

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market rose first and then fell, with various cloths showing mixed results. The general sentiment among traders was to sell and retreat because the Taohua Women's Lin Dongpi fell. However, the group's fine cloth market turned firm again. For example, 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was quoted at 182 yuan, Samsung 180 yuan, Feihong 178 yuan, Caihua Butterfly Factory Order 144 yuan, 9-pound New Character 110 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 107 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth 162 yuan, Dapeng Factory Order 154 yuan, Fugui Factory Order 153 yuan, and Fugui Bank Order 143 yuan were all stable. Three-sheep Serge Liyuan 8.5 yuan, down 5 cents. Taohua Women's Lin opened in the morning at 266 yuan, and the market fell to 259.5 yuan, a sharp drop of 5.5 yuan per piece.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, the wind turned back. The leading fine cloth fell especially sharply due to the factory urging out warehouse rent. The opening price was 182 yuan, gradually falling to 178.5 yuan, a fall of 5 yuan per piece. Although the mid-range fine cloth was tired, it was still firm, falling 2.5 yuan to 3 yuan. Caiqiu closed at 162.5 yuan, Yanghe 158 yuan, Laba 155 yuan, and Wufu 154 yuan. The opening price of Four Gentlemen Serge was 7.48 yuan, rising to 7.53 yuan and being sold off, falling to 7.36 yuan, and finally closing at a high of 7.40 yuan due to the still strong market, a fall of 5 cents per yard.

### Money Market Loosens Daily; Discount Rate Falls Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Japanese military notes fall and then return to flat. Initially, inter-bank transactions were done in large amounts, selling at 5.5523 cents, and buyers appeared when it was low. It was seen to return to 5.5557 cents, and finally the buying and selling prices of bank and private dealers were 5.56 to 6.5 cents for selling and 5.545 to 5 cents for buying.

Yesterday, the discount rate of the Money Industry Association continued to fall by a small 2 cents, to 1.3 cents. The money market is loosening daily, and newly drawn head notes have been exchanged for cash at par for a long time, but the bank's head drawing has not yet been cancelled.

Grains Tired More, Good Less

Bean transactions were quite desolate yesterday, because the authorities will strengthen the control of the prices of essential goods, resulting in fewer buyers. Only 20 packs of Chongming sand silkworms were traded in the unified market, the price being 116 yuan, and the market trend was weak.

Yesterday, some floating accounts were sold off for corn, but there were very few recipients, and the price saw a fall. It is estimated that 50 packs of Wuhu corn cost 104 yuan.

Wheat bran turned better yesterday due to the movement of rural sales, and people's hearts turned better, and the price tended to be firm. It is estimated that nearly 1,000 packs of Sanxin small pack wheat bran with a warehouse receipt date of May 28 cost 99.5 to 100 yuan, a rise of about 1 yuan.

### Candles Unique

Daily necessities such as soap on the market are stable because the authorities strictly prohibit price limits. Matches are in a slump because of the constant sale of goods at flat prices. The market is tired and colorless. The hot summer has passed for foreign candles, and sales have become slightly active. Furthermore, because the people of this street need them very urgently, the price has changed from tired to clever. It is estimated that Gu Ben soap is still 300 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap is 245 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is 215 yuan, and Scissors soap is 265 yuan, all of which have changed little. Phoenix brand 2,500 yuan, Beauty Spleen 2,750 yuan, Gold Tripod brand 2,350 yuan, miscellaneous brand 2,000 yuan, are still falling more and rising less. White Lee's foreign candles 135 yuan, Monk Hat brand 130 yuan, miscellaneous brand 105 yuan, up to ten yuan.

### Gambier Number Very Tight

Gambier is very tight because of the high cost. Recently, the military Chong has increased by 30 yuan, so the market has also risen accordingly. For example, Xinguang small-grain Ganmu sells for 3,900 yuan, Laoguang medium-grain sells for 3,700 yuan, and Sanjiao sells for 3,200 yuan.

### New News from the New Autumn Chrysanthemum Troupe

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

The Shanghai Pear Garden world will soon turn from silence to excitement. In addition to the Golden and Renewed companies having secured Wu Suqiu, Ye Shengzhang, Yan Huizhu, and Yan Shaopeng, the Queen's Grand Theatre has also sent specialists to Ping to invite actors, with three targets: Jin Shaoshan, Shang Xiaoyun, and Li Wanchun and Mao Shilai. Although it is widely rumored that Li and Mao have already reached an agreement, according to my knowledge, there are many hidden reefs in it, and whether an agreement can be reached is still uncertain, because the agreed-upon salary amounts are still far apart. (It is said that Yan Huizhu has accepted an engagement at the Danggui Stage in Yantai and will be leaving soon. If this is true, then the Shanghai Renewal side will have to find someone else. Let's keep this information in mind until it can be proven by facts.)

Xu Biyun, after returning east from Chang'an, has the intention of making a comeback. With the assistance of her brother, Lan Yuan, the troupe has been organized. The first play is "Yu Xiaocui," which was performed at the Grand View Garden in Dazhalan on the 12th of this month. Its popularity has not diminished from its former glory. The theater was already full before the gong was struck. The second performance is still at the Grand View Garden, on Saturday night, the 15th, with the play "The Entire Borrowing of the East Wind." Biyun will play the role of the young scholar, acting as both Zhou Yu before and after. This play was learned from the Thirteenth Dan (Hou Houshan) of that year, and the sword dance scene has an amazing performance. The distribution of roles is also quite neat, with Wang Shaolou playing Zhuge Kongming, An Shuyuan playing Lu Su, Ma Fulu playing Jiang Gan, Zhou Rui'an playing Zhao Yun, and Liu Lianrong playing Huang Gai, all equally matched and worthy of being called a rare choice. The third performance will be the famous work "Lüzhu Falling from the Building," with the location being either Chang'an or Huale. Future plays are still being discussed, but Biyun herself is advocating for a period of "Arresting and Trying," and if Lan Yuan agrees, it can be decided and announced.

Li Shifang accepted an invitation from the Tianjin China Grand Theatre and departed from Ping on the 9th of this month, starting her performance on the night of the 7th with the Mei school play "Lian Jinfeng." The second day was "Phoenix Returns to the Nest," and the third day was "Hong Xian Stealing the Box." All of these are famous works from Mei's career. Little Mei Lanfang should have some airs. The supporting actors that Shifang brought this time are not much different from her last visit to Shanghai. The old actor is Ji Yuliang, the painted face is Yuan Shihai, the young scholar is Jiang Miaoxiang, the clown is Sun Shengwu, the martial clown is Ai Shiju, the sweeping corner is Li Shilin, the young female role is Ren Zhiqiush, and the martial art student is Cai Shihua, a graduate of the Tianjin Jigu Society. Cai is young and strong, and his art is not weak. The play "Yun Huan Tao" was personally taught by the old actor Shang Heyu, and it is orderly and generous, enough to compete with Gao Shenglin and Yang Shengchun.

### Two High-Pitched Male Actors (Part Two)

— Sick Dove

——Song Baoluo and Ji Yuliang

Ji Yuliang has performed in Shanghai more than three times, and there has been progress each time, which is gratifying. His voice is getting brighter every day, and he also has a slight water sound, which is a rare talent among the emerging old actors. Last time, I heard him perform "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Visiting Mother," "Empty City," and "Li Ling's Stele" at the Golden Theatre. Among them, "Catching and Releasing Cao" was the most satisfying, "Visiting Mother" and "Empty City" were also not weak, and "Li Ling's Stele" was terrible. Yuliang entered the stage as an amateur, and his fire is still shallow. Plays like "Li Ling's Stele" need not be performed. "Bumping the Stele" is an old Tan's famous play, and he sang it in his later years with more perfection. This play has many inverted tones, and the inverted Erhuang has three pitches, and the ups and downs are extremely difficult to match. The melody sung by Ji Ling on that day was pieced together, and it was still awkward. Mr. Su Shaoqing and I were sitting together, and he said to me: Yuliang's capital is sufficient, but the middle sound is not enough, and the low sound also lacks research. I deeply agree with his statement. This is the same disease as Song Shiluo. In general, the craftsmanship of the actors is not enough, and most of them suffer from this disease, resulting in a thin flavor and not enough addiction. If they can carefully study and discuss, there will be a day of enlightenment, and there is nothing to worry about. Yuliang's voice is suitable for high-pitched but not good at low-pitched, and the pronunciation is strong but not calm enough. Singing Xipi is quite happy and has charm, while Erhuang's plays lack the pure and slow sound. Even in "Catching and Releasing Cao," the stage of the inn is not as pleasant to hear as when walking on the road. As for the singing, diction, and pronunciation, there are many points that can be discussed. Due to limited space, I will omit them for the time being. But there is one thing that cannot be stopped from speaking, that is, the emotion of singing. Famous artists sing opera and can reveal emotions in the lyrics and rhythms, making people fascinated and unconsciously going back and forth. Emotion is the soul of singing, the cow life of singing. Singing without beautiful rhythm and rich emotion feels lifeless. In the past, when Lao Tan performed Qing Dingzhu, singing to the sentence "Raising his head sharply and seeing the red sun falling to the west," the inflection was appropriate, and the charm was outstanding. The audience listened to his voice, closed their eyes and thought quietly, as if there was an old man with white hair, in the twilight, paddling a small boat and fishing by the river, and the scene in front of them was like being in the same environment. Song and Ji, who have become famous actors, are enough to speak about this. I hope that they can work hard on this subtle rhythm and carry it forward, and it can be expected that they will become families in the future. If you say that there is no one in front of you who can be emulated, then watching Zhou Xinfang's plays is also a gain.

To sum up, there is more depreciation than praise, which is also the meaning of criticizing virtuous people in the spring and autumn period. The period is so urgent that I don't feel the weight of my words. The two sons are virtuous, and I hope they will not be separated from my education.

### The Emerging Guangyi Drama Troupe

— West

Lin Feng'an, of the literary and artistic circles, felt that Cantonese compatriots in Shanghai were separated by a gap, although they were able to enjoy appropriate and noble entertainment to regulate their body and mind. He specially joined forces with Chen Junyang, who holds the authority of Cantonese music in Shanghai, and Miss Chen Liying, a famous singer, and many theatrical geniuses to organize a Guangyi Drama Troupe, which performs in the form of stage dramas and improved Cantonese opera. A play of exaggerated dialogue and classical music, named "Ruo Lan's Complaint," has now been written. The story is taken from Su Hui's palindromic brocade, which is a four-act historical family play. Mr. Lin spent several months of his mind and blood, using pure literary means to write and direct it, with poetic and artistic elegance and popular appreciation. In addition to the witty, relaxed, tense, and lively dialogue, there are as many as seven interlude songs, with novel lyrics. There is also a play-within-a-play scene, performing gongs and drums Cantonese opera, which is particularly unique. It is said that Mr. Lin's writing and directing of this play, every word and every move, is subtle and tortuous. It has been decided that the premiere will be held in a charitable way on the morning of the 29th and 30th of this month, and the location is the Green Treasure Theatre on Nanjing Road. There will definitely be a grand occasion at that time.

### Wei Zhongle Plays the Main Role in a National Music Concert

Wei Zhongle, a famous master of national music, is proficient in Chinese and Western music theory and is good at classical musical instruments. He has performed in major cities at home and abroad and has won unanimous praise from the society. Recently, in order to raise funds for the Li Zongyue Journal, he generously agreed to hold a personal national music concert as a volunteer. The location is in the auditorium of Aurora University. The date is set for the 29th of this month (Saturday) at 5:15 PM. Major music stores and the Aurora door room have tickets for sale.

### Short News

The Shanghai Amateur Puppet Theatre has recently performed the new puppet show "Primitive Man" at the Jewish General Assembly Hall on Jing'an Temple Road, with great success. Because many people have been disappointed in the fast day, the special continuation of the public performance for three days since yesterday, today at 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM, tomorrow at 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM there are still four performances, which is most suitable for children to watch.

### New Words in the Circle

— Xinye

The Queen's first new roles were originally scheduled for Shang Xiaoyun or Jin Shaoshan, but the conditions were not met. The hospital has not yet officially announced who it is currently booking. News came from the north that Li Wanchun and Mao Shilai have been hired. The Queen's booking staff can arrive in Shanghai today and tomorrow. The second and third batches of roles are Shang Xiaoyun, Jin Shaoshan, Xi Xiaobo, and Tan Fuying, all of whom are target figures. At the same time, it is heard that the Golden side has also scheduled Ma Lianliang, Cheng Yanqiu, and Xun Huisheng to compete.

After the successful reorganization of the Queen's Theatre, the Shanghai Ping Theatre was followed by the Central Grand Theatre. However, the hospital has not been able to make appointments with Zhou Xinfang and Zhang Yipeng, and is still planning. Recently, there has been a rumor that the New Light Grand Theatre will also be converted into a Ping Theatre. It is heard that the lessees are a few amateur ticket holders, but because the hospital asked for too high a rent and there was no corresponding assurance of business, they hesitated and could not make a decision for a while. There is also talk of converting Dahuа, Lido, and Paris into Ping Theatres.

Recently, various newspapers have been spreading the news of Zhang Wenqin's performance. According to a friend close to Wenqin, since Wenqin became Madame Yao Muhn, her life has been very well-off. Mr. Yao works in the banking industry and comes from a wealthy family, and he will never rely on Wenqin's skills to support the family. However, recently, various theatres in Shanghai lack talent for female roles, and many have encouraged her mother to persuade Wenqin to return to the red carpet. Recently, artists have been frequently entering and leaving Wenqin's mother's house on Kim Divine Father Road, which has led to the emergence of this news. In fact, Wenqin herself has never had any intention of becoming Mrs. Feng again.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Stormy Weather

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What Can One Do?

Just as Second Madam Ye was about to call out, a burly man strode in, placed a piece of black cloth over her head, and shouted, "If you value your life, don't make a sound!" In her terror, Second Madam Ye knew that bandits had arrived. A constant droning sound filled her ears, and her hearing became unclear. Her eyes saw only a patch of darkness from which countless sparks burst forth, and her vision blurred. After a considerable period, she heard the cocks crowing in the house. Second Madam Ye felt that her hands and feet were bound with rope. She struggled, but they remained tied. Ah Xing and He Zixing rushed in from outside and said, "Ah! Second Madam has also been tied up!" As they spoke, they rushed forward to untie the ropes. Second Madam Ye, now free, asked, "Have you seen the young master?" Ah Xing said, "The three of us were all tied up by the robbers. The robbers came down from the roof. We saw a ladder leaning against the eaves in the courtyard, but we didn't see the young master." Second Madam Ye said, "Quickly, find the young master." By this time, the sky was beginning to dawn. Xu Quanfu also rushed in, followed by rice carriers, and they went to look in Wei Cheng's bedroom, but Wei Cheng was nowhere to be seen. Second Madam Ye's hands and feet were swollen from being bound by the bandits, and she limped as she walked. However, she insisted on following behind the farmhands, urging them to quickly find Wei Cheng. Madam He and Xi Que timidly emerged, saying, "The robbers shouted outside our room, saying that anyone who took a step or spoke a word would have their head chopped off." Second Madam Ye only urged them to find the young master quickly. Madam He held up a wall lamp, but it was blown out by the cold wind. Fortunately, Ah Xing had a box of matches in his hand. He lit three or four matches in each room. Finally, they found Wei Cheng in the Shuangqiao study, bound in a ball with cotton stuffed in his mouth. Second Madam Ye's heart ached terribly. (161)
