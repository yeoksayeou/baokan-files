### Pan-American Conference Holds Plenary Session; All Countries Express Determination to Cooperate; Severance of Relations with Axis Powers Likely to Pass; Defense and Economic Committees Hold Separate Meetings

Rio de Janeiro, 17th (Havas) – The Pan-American Conference continued its meeting yesterday. The general atmosphere seems somewhat more optimistic than before. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Welles, the chief delegate, held two talks with Argentine Foreign Minister Guani in an office at the venue. Afterwards, both showed expressions of joy. Conference President Aranha, after holding separate talks with the chief delegates of various countries, told reporters that his impression was "very good." It can be seen that Brazil's mission in this conference is very important. In short, Brazil has decided to thoroughly support the United States, and will do its utmost to find a compromise to reconcile the different views of all parties. Judging from the current situation, it is possible to find a way for Argentina to "cease communication" with the Axis powers without completely severing diplomatic relations.

Rio de Janeiro, 17th (Havas) – The Economic Committee of the Pan-American Conference held its second meeting at 11:00 AM this afternoon. Conference President Aranha met with U.S. Chief Delegate Welles this morning.

Rio de Janeiro, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The Pan-American Conference held a plenary session at 10:30 AM yesterday, and read out a message from Argentine Vice President Castillo. The section concerning the inseparable relationship between Argentina and the ideals of Pan-Americanism was met with enthusiastic applause from all delegates. Afterwards, the members of the U.S. Land Defense Committee and the Committee on the Economic Relationship between the Western Hemisphere were introduced. Subsequently, the foreign ministers of the various countries present delivered speeches, all expressing their determination to abide by the spirit and resolutions of the previous Pan-American conferences, and to continue Pan-American cooperation in order to defend the independence of the Americas. The meeting ended at 1:00 PM. The U.S. Land Defense Committee held a meeting immediately, and Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha was elected as chairman.

The above two committees will continue to hold meetings today.

Argentine Vice President Clarifies Attitude of Cooperation

Rio de Janeiro, 16th (Havas) – Since the opening of the Pan-American Conference, Argentina's attitude has become the most important issue for the delegates. The country's Vice President Castillo sent a letter to the Chairman of the Conference (Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha) today to clarify something, stating, "My country's loyalty to the Pan-American countries is unwavering. The various rumors circulating outside are not true. Their intentions are obviously to confuse the public and distort the position taken by my government. In practice, my country has no intention of opposing the future position of other countries in the Americas. My country's representatives attending the conference have received instructions from the government to establish agreements with various countries to strengthen cooperation among the Pan-American countries, but they still want to review the situation before passing any decisions." This letter was read by Conference President Aranha.

Buenos Aires, 16th (Havas) – Vice President Castillo told reporters from the World News today, "My country's attitude at the Pan-American Conference does not mean creating something new. In fact, it is not only beneficial to our common goals, but also faithfully unchanging. My country has sent representatives to participate in the conference to discuss what is the best way to implement the resolutions passed at the previous conference. We are participating in the discussion, knowing very well the situation of other countries, and we also know our country's needs very well. Therefore, we have no intention of opposing other countries in the Americas. Not only that, but we still regard the United States as a non-belligerent country. This attitude is more beneficial than those countries that take extreme decisions. In short, in the current environment, we can provide the United States with valuable economic cooperation."

Washington, 17th (Havas) – Political figures here are generally satisfied with the opening of the Pan-American Conference. According to Secretary of State Hull, the positions clarified by the foreign ministers of Uruguay, Mexico, and Venezuela at the meeting yesterday are deeply admirable. This move proves that they all have a very clear understanding of the current situation. It is widely believed that the conference will eventually vote to pass a resolution to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers by all the countries in the Americas. According to reliable sources, the Argentine government is now considering changing its attitude, or it may endorse the proposal of the Colombian Foreign Minister to sever relations with the Axis powers. In addition, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Guani proposed to expand the authority of the Pan-American Neutrality Committee, which was established two years ago. Political figures here are also satisfied with this proposal, because according to Guani's proposal, the committee should be responsible for adjusting all issues related to the Pan-American joint defense.

Plans to Promote Trade to be Studied by Subcommittee

Rio de Janeiro, 16th (Havas) – Colombian Foreign Minister Turbay recently submitted a proposal to the Pan-American Conference on behalf of his country and the governments of Mexico and Venezuela, advocating that all countries in the Americas sever diplomatic relations with all Axis countries.

Rio de Janeiro, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – When the Pan-American Conference was held yesterday, the Colombian representative submitted two proposals: one was for the American nations to sever relations with the Axis countries, and the other was to maintain the economic life of the American countries and promote trade among the American countries, and put forward specific plans. The above two proposals will be studied by a subcommittee on the 19th.

Rio de Janeiro, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The Bolivian representative made five suggestions at the Pan-American Conference yesterday: 1. The use of force to occupy the territory of other countries should be considered an illegal act. 2. Economic relations between large and small countries in the Americas must have a solution. 3. A protective system should be established to promote industry and commerce among the countries in the Americas. 4. Economic unity is essential for the defense of the Americas. 5. Raise funds to build the Pan-American Highway.

Rio de Janeiro, 16th (Havas) – Honduran Foreign Minister Caceres declared at the Pan-American Conference this month that my country's attitude is unconditionally supporting the United States. The chief delegate of Guatemala, Arroya, said, "My country will never allow its freedom to be destroyed."

Rio de Janeiro, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – Haitian representative Bonhomme stated at the Pan-American Conference yesterday that totalitarian countries treat black people poorly. Most of the ancestors of the Haitian people came from the Old World (Africa). Therefore, in order to protect their race and maintain the unity of the Americas, he advocated that the countries of the Americas must fully cooperate and must support any plan to defend the Americas in order to seek the victory of democratic countries.

### Difficulty in This Year’s Finances After Decline in Municipal Council Tax Revenue

Loss of Automobile Licenses Has Been Compensated

The Shanghai Times stated that the Municipal Council’s 1942 budget will not be finalized until mid-month. However, according to Mr. Maugham, the Chief of the Financial Department of the Council, who spoke to reporters yesterday (the 16th), all parties were previously worried that as a result of restricting automobiles, the Council’s income would be drastically reduced. But now, due to the sharp increase in private cars and other vehicles, and the fact that their license fees have doubled compared to last year, the worry of a drastic reduction in the Council’s income has been eliminated. The major difficulty the Council will encounter is making up for the loss of municipal consolidated tax revenue this year. This is because the Council handed over the right to collect taxes in the Shanghai Western District outside the Settlement to the downtown area last month, causing a major setback to the Council’s collection of municipal consolidated taxes. Taxpayers in the Public Concession have found it difficult to cope with the current taxes decided by the Council in June. Therefore, it is expected that this year’s tax revenue will not continue to maintain its normal level, and will be reduced by about 5% compared to the total of 46,378,500 yuan in 1941. The Council’s loan of 16 million yuan from HSBC and the additional collection of various surtaxes are not included. Mr. Maugham also stated that the Council’s greatest difficulty this year is coping with the losses caused by the reduction in tax revenue. However, the Council has recently taken measures to reduce expenditures, such as reducing salaries and eliminating gratuities, which will greatly reduce the Council’s expenses this year.

### Silver and Money Trade Announcement: No Refusal of Damaged Banknotes; All New and Old Versions of Banknotes Should Be Accepted Universally to Facilitate Circulation and Benefit the Market

The Shanghai Silver and Money Trade Association Joint Committee sent a letter to all member firms and banks, stating: "It has been observed that recently, in our city, there has been a tendency to reject slightly damaged banknotes in circulation. Consequently, banks and money shops may refuse to accept them, causing inconvenience to the public and potentially hindering future transactions. This is contrary to the fundamental goal of facilitating financial circulation and stabilizing the market. Therefore, this committee has resolved that all banknotes currently in circulation, except those that cannot be redeemed according to the regulations for redeeming damaged banknotes (i.e., banknotes with three-quarters or more of the original amount will be fully redeemed; those with less than three-quarters but more than one-half will be redeemed for half the amount; those with less than one-half will not be redeemed; and deliberately altered banknotes will not be redeemed), shall be accepted and circulated as usual. All firms and banks should take the lead in accepting them, so that the public can also use them. Furthermore, large denominations of 100 yuan and 50 yuan notes, as well as all new and old versions of banknotes already in circulation, should be accepted universally and not refused, to facilitate circulation and benefit the market. In addition to publishing this announcement in the newspaper and sending separate letters to relevant agencies, we are also sending separate letters to you, hoping you will investigate and implement accordingly. We wish you prosperity."

### Authorities Issue Free Travel Permits to Facilitate Villagers' Return Home; Unemployed People Should Apply to Designated Agencies Immediately

Since the Incident, the number of people from various places seeking safety in Shanghai due to war and banditry has been increasing day by day, leading to a decrease in the population of the countryside. Now, the population of Shanghai alone has reached more than six million, an increase of one million to one and a half million compared to before the Incident. The source of food has become a serious problem. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the international situation has changed drastically. The import of all raw materials is difficult, and they cannot be obtained. As a result, many factories have closed down, and most workers and those who depend on factory life have been laid off and are unemployed. These unemployed people should return to their hometowns as soon as possible to seek a living. Previously, travelers had to carry a citizen's card or a county resident's card. Now, in order to give preferential treatment to unemployed people returning to their hometowns and to facilitate their return, "Special Return Home Travel Permits" are issued free of charge in a simple manner. Those who have this travel permit can travel freely even without a citizen's card or a county resident's card. Travelers to Ningbo and Zhenhai no longer need to obtain the Zhejiang Eastern Travel Permit and Zhenhai Landing Permit issued by the Ningbo Township Joint Association in Shanghai for three yuan each, as these permits were discontinued on January 12th. They only need to obtain the free "Special Return Home Travel Permit" to travel. Moreover, the "Special Return Home Travel Permit" can be used not only on steamers but also on all sailing vessels. In addition, the East Asia Travel Agency has also established a "Information Office" to facilitate the return of villagers home, providing free services, informing them of all return travel procedures, and also issuing special return travel permits, and selling ship and train tickets to facilitate the villagers' return home. The locations for issuing free special return travel permits are as follows. It is hoped that all returning villagers will quickly obtain them and return to their hometowns as soon as possible.

### Tahu Cart Workers Plead for Relief

Hundreds of tahu cart workers at the Swire and Roosevelt wharves in the French Concession have been working for many years. Since the supply of gasoline was restricted, the transportation industry has been affected. In addition, due to shipping delays and a shortage of goods, their livelihood has become difficult. Therefore, the Shanghai Transportation Company was organized to adjust work and seek a meager living. Unexpectedly, the former Hua Tai Transportation Company is now monopolizing the relief of goods. The association is trying to find a way to mediate the situation.

### Man and Woman Attempt Suicide by Poison; Shoe-Shining Girl Dies for Love; Man Revives and Promises to Support the Woman's Mother

At around 7:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, a tea boy at the Great China Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road discovered that there was only a faint breath of a woman in room 501, who was about to die. He reported it to the cashier, who reported it to the Laozha Police Station, instructing detectives to investigate. They learned that the room was opened by a person named He Keren, who had left at dawn. The woman was sent to Renji Hospital. The doctor confirmed that she had committed suicide by taking poison. Because it had been a long time, it was impossible to save her, and she died. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. No relatives of the deceased were found, and the body was sent to Pushan Villa for coffin burial. The day before yesterday, the General Police Station suddenly received an anonymous letter containing a very detailed account of the case, stating that the deceased was named Jin Yazhen, 19 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 729 Gordon Road, and working as a shoe-shiner at the Heguang Women's Shoe-Shining Company on Yuqiaqing Road. The man's name is not He Keren, but Zhang Pinshan (also known as Gu Tinian, 31 years old, from Pudong), who usually spends his time with prostitutes. Zhang is now hiding on the mezzanine of No. 350 Weihaiwei Road. The Chengpu Road Police Station was informed and sent detective Xu Dezhong to investigate and verify the information. Zhang Pinshan was arrested and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, requesting detention on the grounds that Zhang had instigated suicide. When questioned, Zhang Pinshan confessed that he had known Jin Yazhen for three years, and they had become even closer in the past six months. However, due to economic pressure, they both embraced a pessimistic attitude and decided to commit suicide together. He pawned a coat for 60 yuan and, on the afternoon of the 2nd, rented room 501 of the Great China Hotel, using the alias He Keren. They both wrote suicide notes and swallowed two bottles of poison. Unexpectedly, he woke up at around 6:00 PM and saw that Jin's complexion was very different and could not be saved. So he left first and went to Tongfu Hospital, No. 70 Lane, Tongfu Road, for treatment, where he was saved by Dr. Qin Cihai. He then learned that Jin had died and met with Jin's mother, Wu, to inform her of her daughter's death and promised to assume all future financial responsibilities, first paying 1,000 yuan. Subsequently, the deceased's mother, Jin Wu, testified that the defendant had come to her home and that her daughter had died, and that the defendant had paid her 1,000 yuan, etc. Judge Zhan reviewed the confession and ordered Zhang Pinshan to be detained for further review in seven days.

### Refusal to Use Damaged Banknotes Widens; Also Includes Old and Worn Notes; Stored Cash Floods; Prefer to Guard the Vault

The scope of refusal to use damaged banknotes in the market is increasing day by day. Even old banknotes with slightly worn paper or small holes are being severely rejected by shops and stalls. When asked why, they all say that banks do not accept them. However, shopkeepers also feel that it is difficult to accept or refuse. Refusing means less business, and accepting means inconvenience in giving change. Using them to settle accounts with silver and money shops is also refused. The reason why damaged banknotes are crowded in the market is that the withdrawal of cash has been restricted since the Incident. The more people withdraw cash, the more silver and money shops take advantage of the opportunity to push the damaged banknotes and worn notes that are usually difficult to use in their vaults onto depositors. Even to the extent that in 500 yuan banknotes, there are 100 to 200 yuan of damaged banknotes (this is what is truly damaged, and there is a higher or lower degree compared to what is currently called damaged). They could not be used in the market at that time and were refused to be exchanged. As a result, many depositors suffered losses. This kind of immoral behavior of harming others and benefiting oneself is disgusting. If normal acceptance and payment were maintained, the situation would still be excusable. However, after a large number of damaged banknotes were released from the vault, they used the reason that the original issuing bank had suspended operations and could not be exchanged to be even more severe in rejecting the banknotes submitted for settlement, refusing to accept them. Someone questioned, "Why did you give out damaged banknotes before, but why don't you accept them today?" People in the industry not only had no reason to answer, but even insulted them verbally. Going back on their word and being unpredictable, commercial ethics have fallen to this point, what else can be said? Now the circulation of banknotes in the market is becoming narrower, the pickiness is becoming stricter, and the refusal to use them is becoming more widespread. In addition, various donations and taxes for trams, tap water, electricity, and telephones, as well as payments for rice, are also refusing to use damaged banknotes, with the trend that only completely new or semi-new notes are accepted. In this situation, they themselves will also feel pain in acceptance and payment. Therefore, there was the announcement from the silver and money industry yesterday, stating that except for those that cannot be redeemed according to the method of redeeming damaged banknotes, all new and old versions of banknotes should be universally accepted, and all banks and money shops should accept them as usual. However, when it comes to accumulating and settling accounts, they still say that the Zhongzhongjiaonong original issuing bank has no hope of resuming the recovery of its damaged banknotes, and that the current new banks are also very strict in picking on the banknotes submitted for settlement. Therefore, there is the question of whether the silver and money industry's actions are as stated in the announcement. To see whether the scope of use of old banknotes in the market is the same as it is now, or whether it has restored its old state, can prove whether the silver and money industry is still making deceptive claims.

Discounting of exchange drafts is still done at a flat rate of every 1,000 yuan. The money industry association's overnight interest rate still opened at six points in the early market and has not changed. The cash reserves of various banks, except for a few special circumstances, are often millions in the vaults. However, the restriction on cash withdrawals remains the same. They would rather keep the cash in the vault than pay out cash for drafts. It is unknown what the psychology is. It is said that if they are asked to discount, even though they say it is at a flat rate, they still charge a certain discount fee, which is also an unexpected income to subsidize them. "Counting pennies" does not escape their nature, so what about serving society?

### Public Debt Rises Sharply; Momentum Even Stronger

The public debt gray market, yesterday the market rose sharply again after several days of gains. Generally, people think it is contrary to the environment, but those with a long-term vision still feel that it is better than cash. Therefore, although there were not many transactions, the upward trend was even stronger, continuing to rise by 8 jiao to 1.3 yuan more than before. It is almost the same as the last closing price on the 6th of last month. Grade C opened well by 2 jiao. Since then, it has been gradually progressing as Tongxing Tongji Lianyi Dingkang continuously bought in. Although Lianhe and Tongyi Da Zhong Yiji successively offered, the upward trend did not diminish. The high price was 6.9 yuan, and the closing price slightly returned to 6.45 yuan, but it has already risen by 8.5 jiao. Grade A continued to advance from 71.5 yuan to a high price of 2.3 yuan, with the closing price at 1.7 yuan, but it has already risen by 1.1 yuan. Grade B went from 66.9 yuan to a high of 8.2 yuan, returned to 7.2 yuan, and the closing price rose by 8 jiao. Grade D went from 62.3 yuan to a high of 3.7 yuan, returned to 3.5 yuan, and rose by 1.3 yuan. Grade E went from 64.2 yuan to a high of 4.7 yuan, with the closing price at 4.5 yuan, rising by another 1.1 yuan. The trend is still a large rise with a small return, and there may not be a huge drop in the short term. The turnover was just over 300,000 yuan.

### Cash Reappears with an Imposing Trend

The cash gray market has regained an imposing trend. The price of gold in Nanjing is 13,000 yuan. At the same time, three gold shops successively absorbed gold. Although the increase was limited, the trend was to rise steadily without returning. In the morning, each tael (ten liang) was first sold by Tiancheng to Chengji for ten liang, and by a gold shop for twenty liang, at a price of 11,050 yuan, which was 30 yuan lower. Soon another gold shop and Hong Qing Yonglai competed to buy in, and the wind turned back, rising to 11,220 yuan. A money shop and Tong Kang Yong sold back to 11,170 yuan. A gold shop and the Nanjing gang bought in, and speculative buyers rose everywhere. At five quarters, it soared another 180 yuan. At noon, it had risen to 11,350 yuan with buyers, a 270 yuan recovery compared to the previous day. There was a difference of 300 yuan on the day. A total of 1,500 to 1,600 liang were traded. The ornament gold market was at 1,200 yuan per liang, with a 150 yuan discount for purchases. Silver was listed at 16 yuan, and the black market was at 11 yuan with buyers.

### Cold Weather Results in Rice Scarcity

Due to the cold weather, it is inconvenient to travel to and from the four villages, and large and small peddlers cannot transport rice as they wish. Therefore, the number of peddlers along the way was greatly reduced yesterday. Only about 100 bags of new goods were reported to have been sampled in the market. Thick japonica rice in the north road is even scarcer, and the selling price of special goods is particularly sufficient, with prices up to 235 yuan, high-quality at 230 yuan, and the general market at 227 yuan. Early thin rice has also jumped out of the 200 yuan mark, with prices ranging from 200 yuan to 202 or 3 yuan, all of which are 5 or 6 yuan higher than the previous market. However, the prices of sharp-headed and circular rice are still stable. Because sharp-headed rice is constrained by the public sale of foreign rice, the price of sharp-headed rice with bags is still 180 yuan. Circular rice has been arriving continuously and has not been digested, still at 194 or 6 yuan. The total turnover in the market was 160 to 170 dan.

### Memorandum on the Use of Damaged Banknotes

— Huigu

"A packet of White Golden Dragon cigarettes." I said, patting the counter of a cigarette exchange shop on the right side of the alley.

"Wait a moment, please wait a moment." The shop assistant glanced at the five-yuan note I placed on the counter, because he was serving another customer. After completing a transaction, he casually tossed a packet of White Golden Dragon over, then picked up my banknote, stretching it flat and examining it under the light.

"This one is no good, sorry, please exchange it." He threw the banknote back to me.

"No good? Why is it no good?"

"Can't you see it's been patched in the middle?" the shop assistant replied impatiently.

"Patched ones aren't good? Weren't they commonly used before?" I insisted on asking for clarification.

"They were good before, not now. Just exchange it!" The shop assistant put on airs.

If it’s no good, I'm determined to spend it, so I ran to another cigarette exchange shop.

"A packet of White Golden Dragon cigarettes." I threw the banknote on the counter and said loudly.

"Sir, this one is no good, please exchange it." The proprietress said, handing the banknote back to me.

I had no choice but to take the banknote and run. Six or seven storefronts down was a roasted nut shop, and I instinctively ran inside.

"A yuan's worth of peanuts." I even forgot that the original purpose of coming was for White Golden Dragon cigarettes, not peanuts.

After he packed the peanuts and picked up the banknote, it was the same story again—

"Sorry, exchange it."

I angrily took the banknote and left. Further down was Mud City Bridge, deserted and without a single shop. The cold wind from the Suzhou Creek made me shiver. "No good!" The more I thought about it, the angrier I became. I ran all the way to the Beijing Road intersection and found a candy shop. I thought I'd buy a yuan's worth of peanut candy. As a result, the banknote was returned again.

"Why exactly is it no good?" I still wanted to ask for clarification.

"Sir, please exchange it. Banks don't accept damaged banknotes, and they're not commonly used in the market."

The cigarette exchange shop wouldn't accept it, the roasted nut shop wouldn't accept it, the candy shop wouldn't accept it, and even the bank wouldn't accept it. What to do? I thought that if shops wouldn't accept it, maybe I could spend it at a stall, since it wasn't a counterfeit banknote.

"Are there any tangerine vendors? Let's buy some tangerines." I thought. I ran to a theater entrance and indeed found a few vendors. After haggling, this "no good" (?) banknote was exchanged for six bright red tangerines. After handing him the banknote, I ran back like I had committed a crime. After taking a few steps, I secretly looked back and was relieved to see him stuffing the banknote into his inner pocket.

I happily carried a bag of tangerines home. As soon as I stepped into the room, I blurted out to Lao Chen, "Eat tangerines, eat tangerines." In an instant, only six tangerine peels remained. Lao Chen asked me:

"Didn't you go out to buy cigarettes? How much is a packet of White Golden Dragon now?"

"White Golden Dragon?" I looked at the tangerine peels, as if waking from a dream.

### Why Aren't They Commonly Used?

— Jin Yi

Suddenly, all the shops in Shanghai unanimously refused to accept damaged banknotes. This "great movement" made me ponder all day long—after having a slightly damaged banknote rejected repeatedly.

The banknote is not fake, the numbers are all there, and judging by its degree of wear and tear, it has fulfilled its greatest responsibility in "transactions" for us humans—otherwise, it should be as white and dust-free as a white-capped cake fresh from the oven! So why is it suddenly "not commonly used"?

According to the shops that refused to accept it: "It's not commonly used outside!" I don't know what "outside" they're referring to; and why is it not commonly used "outside"?

So I thought, and thought all day long.

As a result, I remembered a story, a story familiar to everyone. It's about a person looking at the sky on the street, and gradually all the passersby also follow that person, looking at the sky. Person A asks Person B what they are looking at? Person B says they don't know! Ask Person C, Person C shakes their head...

Yesterday, the Provisional Joint Association of Silver and Money Businesses published an important announcement "regarding the circulation of banknotes." Silver and money businesses are accepting them as usual, so why are they "not commonly used"?

Probably it's another re-enactment of the aforementioned story.

### The Film Circle

— Jing

Chen Yunshang's new film "Seeing the Light Again" after returning to Shanghai started filming the day before yesterday, and is scheduled to premiere at the Shanghai Guang Theater on the Lunar New Year's Day. At the same time, due to the success of "New Sisters," Yang Xiaozhong decided to film another movie, and to show it at the New Guang Theater at the same time as "Seeing the Light Again." The film is titled "Happy Every Year," and the male lead is still played by Mei Xi. It is said that Chen still plays two roles in the film.

The excellent results of "Midnight Song" left a deep impression on movie fans. Last month, there was a rumor that the film's director, Ma-Xu Weibang, would once again produce a horror film for Yihua, with a script also written by himself, titled "Ancient Temple's Remaining Bell." However, there was no follow-up. Until recently, news came that this horror film has been decided to be filmed, and the script has been slightly revised, and renamed "Night Tour of Cold Mountain," starring Li Lihua.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Sixteen Youthful Flames

When Xiangqi entered Shaohua's bedroom, he was sitting like a defeated general in a chair by the window, his face full of melancholy.

"Child, don't be like this. You are a young man who has received higher education and should know your mistakes." Xiangqi walked over, put an arm around his shoulder, and gently patted him. "As the ancient sages said, who can be without fault? As long as you can correct your mistakes, you are still a good child."

Shaohua lowered his head, not saying a word.

"Are you gambling outside? This kind of..."

Before Xiangqi could finish speaking, Shaohua shook his head repeatedly.

"Then you often go to dance halls, right?"

Shaohua still shook his head.

"Could playing ping-pong really lose this much money?" Xiangqi asked in a sarcastic tone. "Otherwise, does the lady who teaches you Mandarin charge you dozens of dollars a day for tuition?"

Shaohua's reply was still a shake of his head, but this time, when he shook his head, his face was flushed red.

"Shaohua!" Xiangqi suddenly sat down opposite him, speaking with a rather serious expression: "I already understand your matter. It is impossible for anyone to forbid a young man from needing love, but there are two things you must recognize: first, money is definitely not something to buy love; second, if the other party is excessively extravagant and spoiled, then it is definitely not your happiness." Because Shaohua's head began to shake again, Xiangqi more bluntly said, "If the other party isn't an extravagant and spoiled girl, how could she let you spend these several hundred dollars in just over twenty days?" (307)
