### Negotiation Process of the Japanese-Vietnamese Economic Agreement

Saigon, 21st (Domei News Agency) - After the signing of the Japanese-Vietnamese Economic Agreement, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux met with reporters, explaining the negotiation process and purpose of the agreement. He frankly admitted that the Vietnamese economy, after the cessation of trade with mainland France, would be difficult to sustain without trade with Japan. He stated that the economic agreement was signed based on the 1941 Tokyo Agreement, and he deeply believed that through this agreement, they could obtain the raw materials necessary to maintain their industry. He was pleased that the representatives of Japan and Vietnam signed this agreement in a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation. He further stated that Vietnam is still a young country in terms of economy, exporting raw materials and agricultural products, and importing manufactured goods and industrial chemicals. The Vietnamese economy depends on this. He noted that Vietnam's overseas exports were mainly to mainland France before the war, with goods shipped to France accounting for 65% of total exports. After the outbreak of the war, trade between Vietnam and mainland France was cut off. Goods could not be exported, and the materials needed could not be obtained. Even if efforts were made to produce substitutes to address the urgent situation, the Vietnamese economy was extremely difficult due to isolation from overseas. Fortunately, with the signing of this economic agreement with Japan, Vietnam can export its products and import necessary materials. Vietnam's exports to Japan are, in principle, rice, corn, and minerals, while Japan's exports to Vietnam are industrial products and textiles.

Tokyo, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," France's permission for Japanese troops to enter Vietnam suggests a change in France's East Asia policy. However, this measure only avoided disputes between Japan and Vietnam. The signing of the new Japanese-Vietnamese trade agreement clearly reflects the changing situation in East Asia. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo hopes that all countries will cooperate with Japan, and Japan is prepared to provide assistance if Vietnam cooperates with Japan. Japan will respect Vietnam's sovereignty and territorial integrity and hopes that Vietnam will also adopt a cooperative attitude on issues such as the development of raw materials and the reform of indigenous education.

### Indian Hindus and Muslims Seek Cooperation

Zurich, 19th (Domei News Agency) - According to a United Press report from Wardha, the Indian National Congress, in view of past Hindu-Muslim cooperation in India being obstructed and constrained by Britain, is pursuing Hindu-Muslim cooperation in order to withdraw British forces from India. However, London is well aware that the impact would be extremely alarming if Gandhi's proposal were implemented. Furthermore, as stated in Speaker Acharya's recent statement, the Muslim League must maintain benevolent neutrality if the Congress launches an anti-British independence struggle. Although the number of participants was not specified, it is well known that a considerable number of Muslims will participate in the anti-British movement, so the situation is considered serious. The Basel newspaper also described the British side's unease, stating that the British side may have a tendency to compromise with India, but the newspaper also represented the British government conversely, stating that if the war is affected by the anti-British movement, a decisive attitude will be taken towards Indian leaders.

### Japanese Military Administration Trains Javanese Technicians

It is reported that the institute is scheduled to open on August 1 and has already started enrolling students. It will be divided into drafting, machinery, engine, and civil engineering departments. The establishment of the institute will make a great contribution to the construction of New Java.

### British Government Publishes White Paper Explaining the Organization of the General Staff: Seamless Cooperation with the War Cabinet, Churchill Invites Beaverbrook to Join the Cabinet and Appoint Him Minister of Defense Coordination

Zurich, Switzerland, 20th (Havas News Agency) - The United Daily News recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in London stating that the British media has been criticizing the British army, navy, and air force for failing to cooperate effectively, and the lack of communication between the General Staff and the army, navy, air force, production and labor departments, and other government agencies. The British government published a "White Paper" yesterday to refute these criticisms and explain the organization of the Imperial General Staff. The main points are as follows: a cooperation committee is formed between the British army, navy, and air force, chaired by Chief of the General Staff Sir Brooke. If Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Churchill is unable to attend meetings due to other commitments, General Ismay will be his representative. The two most important tasks of the General Staff are: first, to provide the government with advice on various issues related to operations at any time; and second, to supervise the various agencies under its jurisdiction in carrying out various tasks. Under the chiefs of staff of the army, navy, and air force, there is a deputy chief of staff to assist them. In theory, all issues should be finally decided by the entire cabinet meeting, but in fact, they are decided by the War Cabinet. In addition to Deputy Prime Minister Major Attlee, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Minister of Production Lyttleton, the War Cabinet also includes the ministers of the navy, army, and air force. The British media has been saying that there is a lack of communication between the government and the General Staff, which is completely inaccurate. As early as 1932, when the military commands of the army, navy, and air force were reorganized to avoid repeating the mistakes of the last war, the government cooperated closely with the General Staff and established an Operations Planning Bureau under the command of the Chief of the General Staff. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Planning and Execution Bureau, and the Future Operations Bureau also participated in the Operations Planning Bureau. Liaison officers were assigned between the various ministries. In addition, there was a Military Intelligence Subcommittee, which was divided into two sections: one for studying enemy operations plans and the other for exchanging information. It maintained direct relations with the various agencies under the General Command. As for the exchange of information between the Cabinet and the General Staff, it was handled by the liaison officer of the General Staff and the secretary of the Prime Minister's Office.

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from London, Lord Beaverbrook is discussing the issue of rejoining the War Cabinet with Churchill. He may be appointed Minister of Defense Coordination. Due to pressure from public opinion, Churchill has apparently decided to relinquish the concurrent position of Minister of Defense, and a person he trusts and can control will succeed him.

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from London, Churchill invited Beaverbrook to join the Cabinet, but Beaverbrook has not yet accepted. It is said that Beaverbrook's return to the Cabinet is closely related to the issue of the Second Front. Within the British Cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister Major Attlee and Minister of Labor Bevin oppose Beaverbrook's entry into the Cabinet. Minister Cripps takes a "neutral" attitude. Beaverbrook's newspaper, the "Daily Express," is calling for an election. The left wing also has the same demand, but the Conservative Party opposes wartime elections, believing that the Prime Minister and Cabinet members can resign, but the demand for holding elections cannot be accepted.

### U.S. Appoints Philip as Head of the Military Intelligence Office in England

Lisbon, 20th (Domei News Agency) - According to news from New York, former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark, Philip, who arrived in London last week, will reside in the U.S. Embassy in London as Deputy Ambassador and head of the U.S. Strategic Office in London.

### A Chorus of Voices in Britain and the United States Calling for Aid to the Soviet Union: Demanding the Opening of a Second Front

Washington, 21st (Havas News Agency) - One million union members in New York have jointly written to President Roosevelt today, demanding the opening of a Second Front in Europe, stating that this matter is not only of great importance to the safety of the Allied countries, but also has an impact on the security of the Americas.

Lisbon, 21st (Domei News Agency) - According to a Reuters report from a sealed port, former British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha gave a speech here yesterday, strongly advocating for the prompt opening of a Second Front. He believed that assisting the Soviet Union was the most urgent task at hand. He stated that we should not overestimate the Soviet Union's resistance strength. What the Soviet people are most concerned about now is the opening of the Second Front. Now that the German army is advancing like an angry tide, heading straight for the heart of the Soviet Union, it is only natural that the Soviet army's operations are sluggish. If we can complete the opening of the Second Front, the Allied forces can achieve victory in the near future. We must know that ignoring the lessons learned from recent operations and simply dispatching troops to the European continent is the most dangerous thing to do. Today, we should promptly provide the Soviet Union with military assistance, otherwise, how can we fulfill our promises? Today is the best opportunity for us to bomb Germany and its transportation lines. There has always been a lack of connection between the diplomatic policies of Britain and the United States. If the United Nations still does not find a way to strengthen the unification of policies, the enemy will surely take advantage of our weaknesses in military and diplomacy to launch greater attacks.

London, 20th (Havas News Agency) - Borden, one of the leaders of the British labor movement, gave a speech at a meeting of the Electrical Trades Union today, advocating for the immediate opening of a Second Front. He stated that the pressure on the Soviet army is increasing daily, and we cannot help but ask whether we are fully prepared to assist the Red Army. Both Britain and the Soviet Union know that the opening of the Second Front is the most urgent task and are well aware that this front must be opened this year. However, in practice, the slowness and delay in domestic preparations are hardly satisfactory. As for the issue of the post-war world organization, it is predicted that after the end of the war, the world will change, and people will definitely feel dissatisfied with the current system and will demand thorough reforms. At that time, capitalism, which is solely engaged in seeking markets, should no longer be allowed to continue to dominate the fate of mankind.

Washington, 20th (Havas News Agency) - Regarding the opening of the Second Front, several weeks ago, before the German army launched offensives in Libya and Ukraine, most Americans believed that this was an ideal scenario and that it was materially impossible for the Allied forces to invade the European continent in the shortest possible time. However, at this point, with the Soviet war situation becoming increasingly serious, American military experts are deeply concerned about the collapse of the Red Army, and they have changed their position, believing that the opening of the Second Front is not only necessary, but also brooks no delay. However, they still believe that the most important issue is transportation work, so that the American expeditionary force invading Europe can be supplied with all necessary goods. In the past, experts estimated that an average of 15 tons of merchant ships would be required per soldier for an American force of 2 million soldiers, which would require 30 million tons of merchant ships to transport military supplies to Europe and supply the American forces. The Allied countries did not have so many merchant ships available for deployment in the Atlantic, so it was concluded at the time that invading Europe was a small possibility. However, recent estimates that 15 tons of merchant ships are required per soldier are based on the assumption that all supplies for the expeditionary force are supplied by the United States itself, which is not entirely the case. Once the major British armaments factories are able to supply the army with their weapons and ammunition, the expeditionary force will no longer need to have all of its supplies shipped from the United States. In recent months, the production of weapons has been stepped up so that they can be supplied to the American army in the future. In addition, the stockpiles of bombs, shells, bullets, etc. are huge and sufficient for launching future offensives. In addition, reports in Washington and New York that Prime Minister Churchill has given Lord Beaverbrook an important ministerial post are considered to be of great significance, and it is expected that it is related to the Allied forces launching an offensive in Europe this year. The recent speech by Czech President Benes to Czech pilots is also extremely important, and its purpose is obviously to make the American people have the idea that it is necessary to send a large number of American troops to Europe.

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to a London dispatch in Swedish newspapers, the issue of establishing the Second Front is still a topic of discussion on the British side. The London government confirms that the strength of Britain and the United States is sufficient to launch this offensive, but at the same time admits that the shipping situation is still not satisfactory. British newspapers not only believe that the establishment of the Second Front is absolutely necessary but also report that the American troops in Britain and Northern Ireland are currently engaged in training for invading the European continent, including training for paratroopers. Hundreds of gliders are being used for landings. According to a London dispatch in the "Evening News," the number of people in Britain demanding the immediate establishment of the Second Front is increasing daily. However, there are still a small number of people who fear that the attempt to establish the Second Front will lead to tragic results, but these people account for only a small minority.

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a correspondent in London published in the newspapers here, the discussions between Britain and the United States on the opening of the Second Front have not yet yielded results, but most people already understand that Germany cannot be defeated by blockade or air raids. To defeat Germany, it is necessary to invade the European continent, but the shipping and transportation issues make the British and American authorities feel difficult to cope with. British newspapers such as the Manchester Guardian advocate for actively aiding the Soviet Union with extremely high voices. However, Churchill and Roosevelt have not yet made any decisions. It is still difficult to predict what medicine they are selling in the gourd.

Germany and Italy Mock and Ridicule it as Empty Talk on Paper

Zurich, Switzerland, 20th (Havas News Agency) - The Zurich Daily News' Berlin dispatch this morning stated that although the talk of opening a Second Front is rampant, it is actually nothing more than empty talk on paper. If the Allied merchant ships continue to be sunk at the current rate, the result will be that not a single armored division and its equipment will be able to cross the Atlantic. Moreover, the purpose of the Second Front should be to save the Soviet southern front, but it is too late to assist the Soviet Union at this time. The Red Army has encountered fatal danger, which no one can deny. Furthermore, the Geneva Tribune's Rome dispatch stated that Italian political circles believe that British financial groups are actually hindering the opening of the Second Front, so this matter has been delayed for a long time, which is not entirely involuntary. Although London and Washington have made various statements, it is not in the interests of Britain and the United States for the Soviet Union to control the European continent, and the German army is progressing extremely smoothly in the Soviet Union. Once the Second Front is opened, it will only accelerate the Soviet Union's consumption, which is in line with the original intention of the British financial groups.

The Axis Powers are Confident of Victory Through Cooperation

Berlin, 21st (Havas News Agency) - General Metz, a strategist, recently discussed "Military Strategy and Political Strategy" on the radio here, stating that since Japan's entry into the war, the strategic cooperation of the three major Axis powers has become indispensable. The German authorities will never take Japan's attack on the Aleutian Islands lightly, because the Soviet Union can no longer receive supplies through the port of Vladivostok. However, when discussing operational strategies, political action and military action are equally important. Up to now, the consensus of political views among Germany, Italy, and Japan has allowed the war to progress completely smoothly. If political differences arise, military affairs will suddenly deteriorate, which will be greatly detrimental to the Axis powers. In short, the Axis powers' military strategy and wartime political action will reach a perfect state, and final victory will be more assured.

### Heart Surgery Successfully Performed

The Divine Skill of an American Doctor

Lisbon, 21st (Domei News Agency) - Performing open-heart surgery is the most difficult, and there are few precedents in medical history. According to news from New York, a 17-year-old American wartime worker was stabbed in the heart. A surgeon removed three ribs for him, sutured the heart in seven places, and then transfused fluid from the heart chamber into the patient's arm vein, saving his life. This is hailed as a divine skill.

### Argentina's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - After Argentina's Congress secretly debated international issues, Foreign Minister Guinaussu told reporters that Argentina's foreign policy remains unchanged. There were no proposals to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis countries during the debate. Argentina's foreign policy line has been determined and is unwavering.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - The Argentine cabinet held a meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by President Dr. Castillo. The main issues discussed were Argentina's oil supply and the employment of merchant ships for transportation. Political circles believe that this cabinet meeting is related to the negotiations currently being conducted by the Spanish commercial delegation. The cabinet will continue to meet today.

Chilean Ambassador to the U.S. Mitchell Returns Home Today

Santiago, Chile, 20th (Havas News Agency) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced that Chilean Ambassador to the United States Mitchell will return to his post from his post in the future. President Ríos greatly appreciates the Ambassador for fulfilling his duties in office. At the same time, Chile's various needs in military, financial and economic matters have also been thoroughly understood by the U.S. government through the Ambassador's repeated explanations. In short, the government's current policy is based on the President's declaration in May of this year regarding the connectedness of the American continent.

### Ship Carrying Munitions to the Philippines Sunk by Germany

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters issued a special communiqué stating that German submarines attacked a convoy carrying munitions to the Philippines north of the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean, sinking seven enemy ships, including one large ship carrying munitions, totaling 38,000 tons.

Six other enemy ships, totaling 51,000 tons, were sunk in U.S. territorial waters. Another enemy freighter was hit by a torpedo and severely damaged. In the past four days, German submarines have sunk 16 enemy ships, totaling 104,000 tons.

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command stated that between July 1 and July 20 of this year, enemy ships totaling more than 600,000 tons were sunk, which is 200,000 tons more than the total number of enemy ships sunk in July last year.

### The Soviet Union Concentrates a Million Soldiers to Defend Rostov, While German Forces Simultaneously Threaten Stalingrad from the East, West, and South

Bern, 21st, Allied Press – A Vichy dispatch without funds, broadcasted today, stated that certain German units are already on the River Migolinsk (approximately 40 miles southeast of Buchach) and may have already re-crossed the Koper River (a tributary of the Don, 60 miles east of Migolinsk). Thus, the German vanguard has reached within 120 miles northwest of Stalingrad.

Moscow, 20th, Allied Press – According to frontline reports, the Southern Soviet forces concentrated their troops and artillery power in front of Rostov on Monday night, fighting with all their might to defend this corner of the Caucasus. The Southern Soviet forces, under repeated attacks by German tanks, dive bombers, and paratroopers, are now continuing to retreat southwest, passing through the Don Basin’s rice paddies, wheat fields, coal beds, railways, and steppes. It is reported that after abandoning the important industrial city of Voroshilovgrad, the main Soviet force is retreating in an orderly manner, while fresh troops are being transferred from the heavily guarded northern Caucasus to reinforce the main force in defending Rostov. Their line of defense extends from Rostov along the lower reaches of the Don River. There is still no news as to whether the German forces will attack Stalingrad. It is inferred that the German forces are currently focusing on expanding and deepening their breakthrough in the south.

German Headquarters, 21st, Havas – This afternoon, the German military report stated that the German and allied forces on the southern front in Europe are concentrating all their efforts to attack Rostov from the east, west, and south. The city is ablaze, illuminating the sky. The bridges over the Don River have been destroyed. German forces slightly to the north are rapidly advancing southeast, only 80 kilometers from Stalingrad.

Lisbon, 20th, Allied Press – German and Soviet forces are engaged in a fierce battle in front of Rostov, vying for strategic points. German forces are exerting pressure southward from the entire Don Basin, repeatedly attacking with tanks and dive bombers, and using paratroopers to block the Soviet retreat, throwing the main Soviet force into chaos.

Bern, 21st, Allied Press – According to news received here, German forces are currently attacking Rostov on the Don from three directions. However, Soviet General Timoshenko has concentrated over a million troops to defend the city. From a micro perspective, the Battle of Rostov will be the fiercest struggle since the fall of Sevastopol. Berlin sources indicate that the German vanguard is already within seven kilometers of the city.

Moscow, 21st, Allied Press – According to frontline reports, Soviet forces are still retreating on the southern front. In the area south and east of Voroshilovgrad, Soviet forces are engaged in rear-guard actions. Over the past few days, the fighting in this area has continued to escalate. The Soviet Red Star newspaper admitted that German forces have repeatedly launched fierce attacks in the Voroshilovgrad area, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Large German tank units are attempting to break through the defenses, and Soviet forces in some locations have retreated to new positions. Furthermore, the Soviet public announcement this noon stated that on the night of July 10-11, our forces engaged the enemy in the area southeast of Voronezh and Voroshilovgrad. There were no significant changes in other sectors of the front.

Berlin, 21st, Havas – Officials here announced last night that the situation on the Eastern Front is becoming increasingly favorable. Since the rainstorms have stopped, the pursuit of the enemy is being intensified. Part of the German forces continues to advance eastward in the central Don region, approaching Stalingrad. German and allied forces that have reached the lower reaches of the Don are now being followed by infantry. The pursuit south from Voroshilovgrad is still ongoing. The Soviet forces pressing on Rostov from the west have increased their pressure. The focus of the current fighting is concentrated near Rostov. German forces west of Rostov are now attacking the Soviet positions built during the winter. Another part of the German forces is advancing north towards Rostov from Voroshilovgrad. At the same time, German forces on the lower Don have cut off the traffic lines east of Rostov. Now attacking Rostov from the east, Rostov is under attack from multiple directions, and the Soviet defenses there are becoming increasingly precarious.

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st, Havas – The Soviet-German war has lasted three months. The German offensive along the Don River has slowed somewhat due to increased Red Army resistance and difficulties in supplying their own forces. Regarding the offensive in the Rostov area, although the German army has expanded its foothold on the northern bank of the Don, there is no confirmation as to whether it has gained a foothold on the southern bank. The Soviet authorities have denied the claim that the German vanguard is only 35 miles from Rostov. Regarding the offensive in the Stalingrad area, after the Red Army withdrew from Boguchar six days ago, the Soviet authorities only stated that they are continuing to advance. According to reliable sources, the German army has crossed the Don River in the Migolinskaya area, 35 miles southeast of Boguchar, and has reached the Chopol River, or is said to have already crossed the river. If so, the German army has reached 100 miles northwest of Stalingrad. As for the defense of Voronezh on the upper Don, the fighting is currently most intense on the southwest sides of the city. German forces north of the city are holding their ground waiting for reinforcements.

### The Situation on the Southern Front is Confusing; Soviet Strength Should Not Be Underestimated

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 20th, Havas – In recent days, torrential rains have fallen in southern Russia, making the roads muddy. However, German forces are still advancing towards Rostov, and the fighting is extremely fierce. It has now been determined that German forces at some points are only four miles from the outskirts of the city. It is likely that the Red Army will not be able to hold out for long, as the possibility of breaking through is gradually decreasing. If they continue to defend the city, it will inevitably lead to a large sacrifice of manpower and resources. The German air force has also been very effective in participating in the fighting, constantly bombing the transportation lines south and southeast of Rostov to prevent Soviet forces from using the Rostov-Salsk-Stalingrad railway line. It is reported that the line has been disrupted in several places, especially the section in the Manych district, where a car bridge has been destroyed. As for the right bank of the Don, German forces have crossed the city of Veshenskaya and are approaching Novocherkassk this morning, now only seven miles from the city. German forces advancing along the Donets River have also attacked Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, and street fighting is currently underway. According to military experts, the Soviet defenders in the Donets basin are in a precarious situation, as they must fight behind the main defense line, that is, the lower reaches of the Donets. And almost all of the Donets industrial area is in the hands of the German army. According to the German side, the fighting in the Donets area has now evolved from a regular, organized war into localized mopping-up operations. The German army's current task is nothing more than mopping up isolated Soviet units. One part of the German army is now advancing northeast of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, hoping to cut off the city's defenders from the rear. Another part of the German army is attacking southeast, so as to link up with the German army on the Don, thereby forming another pocket to encircle the Soviet army. In fact, the truth of the situation has never been so confusing as it is today. No one knows what the real strength of the Soviet combat units on the southern front is, and no one can determine how many of the encircled Soviet troops will be able to break through. The German side stated that they have recently captured a large number of Soviet troops, and will announce the number soon. According to the latest news from the front, German forces have crossed the Chir River and are attacking Rostov directly. Another part of the German army is advancing towards the Migolinsk district. In addition, Soviet forces have also recently attacked the Kerch Peninsula, attempting to land several times, but have been repelled. It is said that a large amount of German military supplies has been transported to the Crimean Peninsula, probably as a prelude to the attack on the Caucasus.

### Soviet Forces Use New Equipment to Counter German Paratroopers' New Tactics

Lisbon, 21st, Allied Press – The Moscow correspondent of the Chicago Daily News stated that the German side is currently using new paratrooper tactics and new equipment on the Soviet front, such as giant gliders carrying hundreds of people. However, Soviet forces countering the paratroopers are also using new equipment, such as thousands of American reconnaissance vehicles, to counterattack.

Berlin, 21st, Havas – German officials pointed out that yesterday, German aircraft attacked the Southern Soviet troops and motorized vehicle concentration areas in Eastern Europe. The Povorino railway station was hit by bombs, causing fires in several places and heavy losses. Several freight trains were destroyed. Soviet railways and supply transport in the Rostov area encountered great difficulties due to German air strikes. North of Voronezh, German dive bombers and fighter planes attacked Soviet positions, tanks, and motorized vehicles, causing great losses to Soviet manpower and resources. Air battles occurred in this area, and eight Soviet planes were shot down. Railways southwest and southeast of Moscow continue to be bombed, and five troop trains were destroyed.

### Soviet Strategy is Unpredictable; German Forces Cautious About Possible Counterattacks

Berlin, 21st, Allied Press

German General Dittmar, in a radio broadcast to the nation on Sunday night, revealed that the German forces have a major defensive line approximately 75 miles behind the current front line in Soviet territory. Dittmar assured the people that the authorities will take all necessary precautions to prevent possible Soviet counterattacks and warned Germans not to be overconfident, saying that the Soviet army is still dangerous. Their current retreat along the vast southern front may be a deliberately implemented strategy. Dittmar also said that the Soviet tactics we are encountering are a completely new kind of tactic, and our plans are also dependent to some extent on Soviet tactics. We must anticipate a large-scale Soviet counterattack at the appropriate time. If so, we should not be caught off guard. We have built a strong line of defense approximately 75 miles behind the current front line.

### Great Sandstorm in Egypt; Fighting Grinds to a Halt; Both Sides Move Troops and Prepare for a Major Battle

Lisbon, 20th, Allied Press – According to a Reuters war correspondent reporting from Alamein, there was no new development in the fighting on the 20th due to hot winds and sandstorms in the desert area. Only German and Italian heavy tank units launched fierce attacks on British forces in adverse weather, engaging in local battles. The air force also suspended operations due to strong winds.

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st, Havas

Recent reports from Egypt indicate that the fighting at El Alamein has eased slightly. Although the days are hot, the nights are quite cold, and soldiers need to prepare blankets to get through the night.

Somewhere on the Egyptian Border, 20th, Havas – According to reports from Cairo, a sandstorm occurred on the Egyptian front yesterday and has not stopped yet. Therefore, only localized fighting occurred on the front today. After occupying the forward defensive line, the Australian army in the northern sector is consolidating its new positions in the Ruweisat area. The central sector is quiet. In the southern sector, British forces made slight progress on the El Taqa plateau. The German army has built strong positions there, so the British forces were quickly repelled by the Soviet 90th Division, and the situation has returned to a standstill. According to military experts here, although the fighting on the front seems to be calm on the surface, a full-scale battle will break out as soon as the sandstorm stops. General Rommel has reorganized his troops. According to reports from British reconnaissance planes, a large number of trucks and tanks have sped from the west to reinforce the front. Also, war correspondents’ dispatches published in Egyptian newspapers stated that the British artillery is in a very important position in this battle. Repeated attacks by Axis forces have been repelled by the British artillery. British artillery fire is exceptionally fierce and the aiming is extremely accurate. At the same time, it is also very successful in covering the armored vehicle and motorized unit offensives. General McCreery's artillery is very active day and night, regardless of the sandstorm covering the sky in both sides airforce areas. British and American planes also bombed Tobruk Harbor and El Adem airfield. Coincidentally, several transport ships arrived from Greece with a large amount of ammunition and were unloading in Tobruk Harbor, which was also bombed by British and American planes.

### Retreating Residents from Dangerous Areas in the Soviet Union

Eisen, 21st, Havas – Eisen’s National News states that people living in the Caucasus, Volga, and Don areas are now mass retreating due to the rapid advance of Marshal von Bock's forces.

The Soviet authorities have also moved archives stored in Stalingrad, Rostov, Shakhty, and other cities in the Donets region. The Soviet Union has also attempted to transport factory equipment, but only part of it has been successful. Other cities in the rear, such as Saratov, Borisoglebsk, Astrakhan, etc., are also preparing to evacuate people.

### Climate Threatens Health, Epidemics Rampant, Shanghai Declared a "Tiger Plague" Zone, Typhoid Fever Spreads and Becomes Prevalent

The English "Times" reports that, according to a report by Mr. Jordan, Health Officer of the Public Works Department, typhoid fever and lung disease continue to threaten health. Within a week, 50 Chinese people contracted typhoid fever, and 42 died. Six foreigners also contracted the disease, one of whom died. Regarding lung disease patients, Chinese residents accounted for 79, and foreigners accounted for 9. A total of 35 people died from this disease. Furthermore, five Chinese people died from dysentery, and one each died from influenza and malaria. No foreign residents died from the aforementioned diseases, but there are still two who are suffering from influenza and malaria, and have not yet recovered. The director also revealed that, in the past week, a total of 703 Chinese people and 21 foreigners died.

Cholera Discovered Earlier Than in the Past

The Tokyo Japanese Health Association has declared Shanghai a "Tiger Plague" zone because 157 confirmed cases of true cholera have been discovered in the two concessions and the Chinese areas of Shanghai in the past two weeks, as officially confirmed. The discovery of cholera in this cholera zone is a month earlier than in previous years, and the first discovery, which occurred on July 6th, is even more unusual. Before July 19th, between 10 and 20 new cases were discovered daily throughout the area. According to reports, the first discovery of a cholera patient was reported by the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital. Subsequently, the hospital quickly received several patients from the Nanshi area. The next day, cholera patients were discovered in Nanshi and northern Fujian. Within a few days, the total number reached 30.

80 Cases in the Two Concessions. As for the discovery of the "tiger plague" in the two concessions, it occurred a few days after the first discovery in Nanshi. The patient was a blind beggar lying on a French Concession road, who was then carried into a hospital and died. Recently, six cases have also been discovered in a village in the suburbs, which has led to the active handling of epidemic prevention work. In the past week, many cases of the "tiger plague" have also been discovered in the International Settlement. It is said that a total of 80 cholera patients have been confirmed in the two concessions, and the rest have occurred in the Chinese area. According to a staff member of the French Concession Health Department, the spread of cholera in the two concessions may be slower than in the Chinese area, firstly because the water supply in the two concessions is adequate, and secondly because residents living in the Chinese area do not pay attention to maintaining hygiene when drinking water, so cholera bacteria easily invade. The Health Department has issued a stern warning to residents, urging citizens to get a second dose of vaccine as soon as possible. If they do not take precautions, the discovery of cholera cases this year will easily exceed last year's number of 900.

Increasing Number of Vaccination Requests

In fact, local residents are indeed aware of the seriousness of the matter, and have been applying for vaccinations in the two concessions for days. The number of people requesting free vaccinations is extremely large. After the vaccination, each person receives a new certificate. The total number of people requesting re-vaccination is difficult to confirm, but the average daily statistics will soon break previous records. In the French Concession, in addition to the public clinic on Avenue Bai'er, designated smoking rooms and densely populated areas are also carrying out this vaccination work, and the majority of people are indeed being vaccinated at these locations. The authorities in the two concessions are advising those who have not been vaccinated by doctors to go to the aforementioned locations as soon as possible to request vaccination. Furthermore, those who have obtained vaccination certificates from doctors can still exchange them for Public Works Department certificates at the Health Department, as before.

Comparison of Anti-Epidemic Vaccinations Over Two Years

In his report on June, the Health Officer of the Public Works Department revealed that a total of 336,206 people were vaccinated against cholera in June this year, compared to only 98,043 people in June last year. Also, 10,899 people were vaccinated against smallpox in June this year, compared to only 414 people in June last year. According to the report, the reason for this phenomenon is probably due to the increase in the number of people returning to their hometowns this year, as those who wish to return to their hometowns must undergo two vaccinations.

Close Attention to Food and Beverages

According to a report from the Public Works Department Health Officer yesterday regarding the situation in June, the supply of vegetables to the Public Works Department market was smooth and abundant last month, but the supply of pork and fish was very insufficient. The report stated that the current supply of fish, meat, and fruits to the Public Works Department is extremely small. A total of 10,033 animals were slaughtered in the slaughterhouses, compared to an average of 11,029 heads slaughtered each month in previous months. 15,297 pounds of major meats were inspected by the Health Department. Furthermore, in this hot summer, the Health Department is paying close attention to food materials and stated that glass covers should be prepared to prevent flies, and close attention should be paid to all cold drinks, sodas, and other summer refreshments. Many vendors in the vegetable market who do not mark prices and inflate prices have been reported and restricted. As for vendors selling meat without official stamps, they are often fined 50 yuan at a time. According to the Health Officer, the current average daily production of milk is 31,684 pounds, the production of cheese is 310 pounds, and the production of butter is 29 pounds.

Epidemic Hospital Advises Citizens

Recently, the scorching heat has been overwhelming, and after the discovery of true cholera in this city, the authorities in the two concessions have taken various steps to curb the epidemic. The hospitals in this city that handle epidemics are all overcrowded. A reporter inquired at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at 25 Chaqing Road. According to reports, the average daily number of outpatients is more than 600, and it has been increasing in recent days. Yesterday (20th), the number reached more than 750. The hospital beds are all occupied, and true cholera is still rampant. The hospital authorities are enthusiastically handling the situation, and are eager to help citizens with their epidemic diseases. Prompt treatment of epidemics is essential. The hospital is busy day and night, providing rapid treatment. Furthermore, it is said that as the "tiger plague" is raging, citizens should pay close attention to their health, which is of utmost importance. It is hoped that the intellectual class will do their best to persuade citizens to 1. get vaccinated against the epidemic, and 2. pay attention to food and beverage hygiene. If anyone is infected, they should be sent to the epidemic hospital immediately, so that they can be treated quickly. If this is done, it will greatly help in eliminating the epidemic atmosphere. The hospital provides daily outpatient services, hospitalization, consultations, and medication, so the daily expenses for medicines and injections are enormous. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in Shanghai will provide financial assistance to prevent the hospital's work from being interrupted, benefiting the poor and sick, which is a blessing for the citizens. Those who wish to donate can send their donations to the hospital, or call 97283 for collection, which is a supreme act of merit.

### Direct Calls to Zhabei, Telephone Sets Must Be Modified, Currently Under Study, Implementation at the End of Next Month, But the Scope is Temporarily Limited to the North of Suzhou Creek

Regarding the issue of direct telephone access between the concessions and the Zhabei area, which involves the improvement of communications at the Mutu City Telephone Exchange, various sectors are showing great interest. However, according to the person in charge of the Shanghai Telephone Company, this matter is still under design and research by the company's engineering department, and can be implemented roughly at the end of next month, but the scope is temporarily limited to the area north of Suzhou Creek. Furthermore, only users who have a high frequency of calls with Zhabei and have been verified by the telephone company will be allowed to install direct-dialing telephones. As for other areas and users, new installations will not occur until the company's board of directors deems it necessary to have direct calls with Zhabei.

Modify Electrical Machines, Add Switches

Telephones that can directly call Zhabei are slightly different in form from ordinary telephones. According to the design of the Telephone Company's engineering department, a switch-type button is added to the telephone. When you want to call Zhabei, you must press this switch to avoid the usual hassle of being switched by 021. The installation of this type of switch inevitably requires various preparations in terms of procedures, and because the required materials are currently in short supply, it is not possible to assemble them in large quantities.

Implementation First in the North of Suzhou Creek

For trial purposes, the Telephone Company plans to first modify ordinary electrical machines in the area north of Suzhou Creek to enable direct calls to Zhabei, as the two areas are very close to each other, making it easier to handle. However, it is not an ordinary modification. The Telephone Company will check the records beforehand and select users who frequently call Zhabei to modify their telephones. Users who do not need to frequently call Zhabei will be refused if they apply to modify their electrical machines. If direct calls are subsequently extended to other areas of the concessions, this principle will also be followed.

Direct Call Charges Unchanged

The charge for direct calls between the concessions and Zhabei is 3 jiao per call, which is the same as the situation where the call is first dialed "01" and switched by an operator, to show fairness. Regarding the Telephone Company's refusal to install new telephones, it is said that this is actually due to a shortage of telephones and that almost all materials are blocked. However, as for telephone relocation, as long as the number does not need to be changed within the same district, the Telephone Company will handle it as soon as possible. If it is moved to another area, it is equivalent to installing a new telephone in that area, so delays are inevitable in terms of procedures and time.

### Return-to-Hometown Certificates Temporarily Suspended

Since this month, the Public Works Department's office for issuing return-to-hometown certificates has shortened its issuing hours to 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and is closed in the afternoon. The office has temporarily suspended issuing certificates since this week, and had not resumed issuing them as of yesterday. It is still unknown whether it will resume operations tomorrow. Furthermore, the number of people obtaining licenses at the Public Works Department's office for issuing bicycle licenses has decreased sharply, so those who have not yet obtained this license can now go and obtain it at any time, without having to suffer the pain of being squeezed.

### Fourth-Term Grain Distribution, Purchase Orders Issued Starting Today, Only White Rice and Flour

The Public Works Department Information Office announces: The matter of distributing the first batch of rice purchase certificates by the various distribution offices of the Bureau starting on the 20th of this month has been publicly announced on the 17th and 18th of this month. The official date of the above certificate issuance is set to end on August 1st. The certificate receiving date for taxpayers has already been clearly indicated on the back of their summer housing tax receipts. For their own benefit, the taxpayers must go to receive the certificates on time to avoid delays and the occurrence of being unable to purchase rice. Furthermore, the sale of the fifth-term rationed rice is scheduled to begin on August 30th.

In addition, the French Concession authorities announced: Due to the hot weather, the hours for issuing rice purchase certificates have been changed. The residents of each district will be notified by the head of the relevant patrol station as to which day and time to go to the rice certificate distribution office to collect them. Please be informed as necessary.

Prices for Fourth-Term Rice and Flour Purchase Orders

The 659 contracted rice shops in the Public Concession and French Concession are notified by the Rice Ration Management Office to collect the fourth-term grain distribution purchase orders from the office. It is stipulated that the date is July 21st for rice shops in the Public Concession, and July 22nd for rice shops in the French Concession. The price of white rice is 309.3 yuan per bag, and the price of flour is 93 yuan per bag. After obtaining the purchase orders, payment and delivery of goods will be made based on the order. The fourth-term rationed grain allocation amount and price are still awaiting further announcement by the board. However, it is understood that the sales prices of fourth-term white rice and flour are roughly the same as in the third term. Whether or not broken rice will be bundled for sale is still difficult to predict, but the rice shops only receive purchase orders for white rice and flour for the fourth term, and there is no price for broken rice, so the fourth-term grain ration may temporarily suspend bundling the sale of broken rice.

Price Limits on Flour and Flour Products

The Public Works Department recently issued Announcement No. 6007, stipulating that from July 23rd, the price limits for flour and various flour-based foods will be revised as follows: (A) Flour: 1. Wholesale price: 93 yuan per bag weighing 49 pounds. 2. Retail price: 2.4 yuan per jin or 2.2 yuan per pound. Retail stores selling with the "flour coupons" attached to the bread ration card may not sell more than 5 jin or 5.5 pounds each time. (B) Bread: 1. Wholesale price: 2.45 yuan per pound. 2. Retail price: 2.7 yuan per pound. The price of bread of different sizes should be calculated proportionally. (C) Macaroni, vermicelli, dried noodles, and similar products: 1. Wholesale price: 3.65 yuan per pound. 2. Retail price: 4.25 yuan per pound, including packaging. (D) Freshly Cut Noodles: All kinds of freshly cut noodles, whether machine-made or handmade, 2.9 yuan per jin. (E) Large Cakes: 2 jiao per cake, at least 1 jin for every 16 cakes. (F) Shandong Large Cakes: 3 yuan per jin. If less than 1 jin, the price should be calculated proportionally. (G) Fried Dough Sticks: 3 jiao per stick, at least 1 jin for every 12 sticks. (H) Steamed Buns (plain): 2 jiao per bun, at least 1 jin for every 15 buns. As for other points, they will still be handled according to Announcement No. 5773.

Total Number of Rice Certificates Issued

The Allied Press reports that the rationed rice system in this city and the concessions has been implemented since July 6th, and is currently progressing very smoothly. The previous difficulty in purchasing rice has been completely eliminated recently. The Public Works Department recently released the number of rice purchase certificates issued in July as follows: △ Number of rice purchase certificates issued: 492,348 north of Suzhou Creek, 82,973 south of Suzhou Creek, 731,165 in the French Concession, totaling 2,035,576. △ Number of rice purchase certificates actually used: 484,394 north of Suzhou Creek, 801,103 south of Suzhou Creek, 723,170 in the French Concession, totaling 2,008,667. △ Number of unused rice purchase certificates: 26,909. A total of 2,035,576 rice purchase certificates have been issued in the two concessions. Almost all residents of the two concessions have been issued rice purchase certificates. The reason why the number of rice purchase certificates issued is slightly less than the actual population is that the Japanese and the Chinese employees hired by the Japanese receive rice separately, so they are not included in the above number of certificates issued. Also, laborers and other poor people often purchase food from food stalls, etc., and do not need rice purchase certificates, so they are not issued.

### Dry Weather, Prone to Fire

A salt fish shop at No. 25 Xiaodongdou Street in the French Concession suddenly reported a fire at around 2:27 PM yesterday. Thick smoke filled the air, and the fire spread like wildfire, immediately affecting another salt fish shop at Nos. 27-29 next door. The lower floors were flooded with water. After fire engines arrived to put out the fire, it was extinguished after about an hour.

At around 8:46 PM last night, the paint materials stored inside a Russian paint shop at No. 00 Baixue Road in the French Concession caught fire and exploded, sounding like firecrackers. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived early and quickly extinguished the fire, so the loss was minimal.

### Authorities Planning to Curb Jewish Economic Activities, Research Has Been Conducted in All Aspects, and Strict Punishment Will Be Pursued

The Allied Press reports from this city that the local authorities are currently preparing measures to curb the illegal economic activities of Jews here, because these Jews are engaged in speculative trading of goods, counterfeiting famous merchants' products, and engaging in other illegal activities that are harmful to Shanghai residents.

Doing Everything Possible

It is rumored that the crackdown will be implemented through the Baojia self-defense system. The specific details of this plan are currently being studied by the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy authorities, the Asia Development Board, the Shanghai Public Works Department, and other parties. In the future, anyone found guilty of these illegal activities will be

Severely Punished

Without any leniency. Moreover, Jewish merchants deliberately take advantage of their foreign nationality to engage in these activities, while Chinese people are restricted and cannot do so. Therefore, the authorities are even more indignant about this. The most outrageous of the illegal activities of the Jews is that a Jewish lawyer spread rumors that there is no need to pay business taxes to the Public Works Department.

### Xinzha Police Station Busts Counterfeit Drugs

Tiger Balm is created by the Hu Wenhu and Wenbao brothers, prominent overseas Chinese merchants from Southeast Asia, and is sold all over the world. Since the suspension of maritime transport in Shanghai and the interruption of goods from Yong An Tang, unscrupulous people have been counterfeiting drugs for profit. On the 4th of this month, the Xinzha Police Station busted a case of counterfeiting Tiger Balm iron boxes, large and small square order trademarks, wrapping paper, etc., and arrested Zhang Ming and Chen Danzhao, two counterfeiters, and prosecuted them for the crime of counterfeiting drugs. After interrogation and confirmation, Zhang and Chen were each sentenced to six months imprisonment to punish them as a warning to others.

Those who do not take the Ryuta Maru will travel on the Kamakura Maru. The ship is expected to arrive here from Yokohama on August 14th and leave Shanghai on the 16th.

List to be Compiled

According to Mr. Masaki, in general, the Ryuta Maru is exclusively for carrying evacuated overseas Chinese from Japan, Manchuria, and various parts of China, while the Kamakura Maru is limited to carrying overseas Chinese from Shanghai and other ports. The list of evacuees is still being compiled and cannot be announced in terms of the allocation of the number of people. The above two ships are only used for evacuating overseas Chinese, and each ship carries 900 people. However, it does not deny the possibility of requisitioning a third ship.

Kontofan Di

The Ryuta and Kamakura Maru are of the same type as the Kontofan Di Wheel. The former has a load capacity of 16,800 tons, and the latter is about 17,000 tons. It is reported that the Kontofan Di Wheel departed Shanghai on the 29th of last month with 636 American officials and civilians and joined the Japanese postal ship Asama Maru on the New Singapore sea surface, and traveled to the Philippines. It is learned that it will arrive in Marguez yesterday.

### Cotton Cloth Again Announces Rise in Price; Industry Actively Makes Proposals

Factory Cloth: Yesterday in the cloth market, due to active proposals from industry members, various cloths continued to rise. Peach Blossom Lady Lin cloth opened at $264.40, gradually rising to $269.50, an increase of $6 per bolt.

Prices were particularly firm and elegant. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth New Single rose from $187 to close at $190, an increase of $7.50 from the previous day.

### Bond Market Remains Dull as Before

Government bonds were secretly strong. Yesterday the market naturally hovered, feeling that people's hearts were relatively stable. Sellers did not seem as eager as before. Buyers were more composed and no longer in the state of having it or not having it that they had been in before. However, there was not much improvement in transactions. Those trying to profit from small fluctuations were relatively few, and most were still watching and waiting. The trend was still mired in hovering and dullness. The small fluctuations in government bonds were also a common phenomenon in the past. However, in the past, they were mostly due to a lack of new stimulus. Recently, they have been completely affected by regulation and control, brewing for a long time, and it is still unknown when they will be able to recover. Yesterday's results were still mixed, with ups and downs. Except for Class B, which was down a small amount of $0.03, Class C had no changes, and the rest all rose $0.21. Transactions were about $600,000 to $700,000. A concise table is listed below.

### Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Unevenly

Yesterday's market situation for Chinese merchant stocks: Dasheng No. 3 Factory had some kind of favorable news, which was greatly absorbed by those with capital. Market prices were firm. Zhabei Water and Electricity was still sluggish. Zhao Hua Commercial Gas Stock had rebounded and had a good chance of being covered. New Pharmaceutical Industry and New Asia fell slightly, Biochemical continued to rise, and the rest were mediocre. Department stores and Yong'an were still favored by buyers, New World softened, Cultural Stocks were flat and weak, and Great China Match continued to decline. Various stocks rose and fell, hovering. Seeing that people's hearts were stable in all directions, transactions were quite active. Now, the market prices of various stocks are recorded separately below.

### Gold and Silver Ornaments: Exchange Rates Unchanged

Yesterday in this city, gold and silver jewelry stores, the Da Xin and Tong Hang companies still displayed the original price of $2,250 per tael for retail sales (purchases were reduced by $350). The exchange price among industry members was a little over $20, between $1,950 and $1,960 per tael. Transactions were even rarer.

Yesterday, the market price for military bonds, the inter-industry exchange price was between $5.545 and $5.55, still flat. Money changers and bank storefronts were buying in at $5.54, but selling at $5.555, or even $5.56, slightly firm, it is said.

### Glutinous Rice Branches Will Arrive Soon

Glutinous rice branches have a fragrant aroma, thick flesh, small pits, and are soft and glutinous. Last year, due to a poor harvest, they were scarce, and even old stock was out of stock for a long time. It is heard that this year's harvest is better. According to news from the Guang Bang Company, new shipments should arrive in Shanghai soon for testing, it is said.

### Sophora Flower Buds Slightly Rise

Although the consumption of pagoda tree flowers has not been significant recently, because prices are still low, the market is very firm. For example, ordinary goods are still less than $100 per picul. Checking the price of each hemp bag, it also needs about $30, so the cheapness of the capital can be imagined. Currently, the selling price of green pagoda tree flowers from Tianjin is $120 to $130, and the next grade is $110 to $90.

### Beans Move Actively; Prices Rise by Ten Dollars

### Sugar Shares to Return Capital Soon; Traded Prices Slightly Rise

Yesterday's sugar stock orders from the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office, because the third installment of capital refund was decided to be issued in April, each share of coarse sand and red sand stock will receive ten dollars in military bonds, so the trend of the association's trading board slightly improved. Coarse sand shares opened at $301 and closed at $303, a good increase of two dollars. Even the red sand shares, which had not been traded for a long time, had transactions, priced at $283 to $285.

Entertainment World

### A Record of Listening to Radio Broadcasts by the Pillow

— Mu Rong

On the 16th of this month, the Tan family and sons collaborated on "A Gathering of Heroes" at the Chang'an Theater in the old capital, and the radio station also broadcasted it. After listening, I wrote this record for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts. When I first started listening, it had already progressed to Ziyi and Gongjin drunkenly falling asleep in the tent. The clown role in the Fuying troupe was originally Ci Ruiquan, or Ru Fuxian. After Elder Ci's death, Sun Shengwu replaced him. This time, Sun Shengwu went to Shanghai, and Ru Fuxian did not play Jiang Gan that evening, but Ma Fulu replaced him. I don't know why. Fulu's casual singing and acting are well known. The reciting of stealing the letter was like gulping down a whole date. The only good thing was that his voice was loud and clear. Miao Xiang's Zhou Yu's voice was not as pleasant as Sheng Chan's. There was too much of his original voice in his dialogue, probably due to insufficient zhongqi. Liu Yanting's Huang Gai was very good. His voice was hoarse, with some of Qian Jinfu's flavor. When performing the bitter tactic, he used a nasal sound for the ying character of the Cao camp when feigning surrender, which won cheers from the audience. Later, when he ordered Kan Ze to deliver the letter to the Cao camp, his long speech was resolute and decisive, which could be used as a model for future generations. Fuying's Lu Su was still good. His original board was steady during the "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats." The two characters "shihou" in "zheban shihou" were slower and rounder than the record he made. At the end, Kong Ming borrowed the wind, and the singing was novel and flowery, not inferior to Lian Liang. The best part was the shouts below shujiu tian shao dongfeng, purely in a low tone, which was extremely pleasant to listen to. Xiao Pei's former Kong Ming was experienced, calm, and more so than Fuying, but unfortunately, he was old and weak, with the same ailment as Miao Xiang. The best part was that Lu Su and Dao Chuan both had a smile after the character "huo" in their hands. The three people divided it clearly and explained it clearly. Xiao Pei's was cold and sarcastic, Miao Xiang's was hateful and fearful, and Fuying's was foolish and straightforward, purely a natural expression, with black and white clearly distinguished, and guests and hosts clearly separated. After beating Huang Gai, Zhou Yu saw Kong Ming sitting痴drinking, knowing that this plan was known by this Taoist, and angrily drew his sword to kill him. Gongs and drums sounded, and I could imagine Zhangren Feng's angry face, wanting to kill his old in-law, causing his good son-in-law to bow and scrape aside, which was worth a laugh. Yang Shengchun's Zhao Yun's voice was not as loud as Gao Shenglin's. The other Wang Quankui's Cao Cao, Song Jiting's Kan Ze, etc., were all mediocre. The north and south are separated, and hearing this good news can relieve a thirst.

### Visiting Stage Artists: Xia Xia Creates "The Widow's Home"

— Lan Ying

In addition to having excellent and moving acting skills, Xia Xia also has a pen that is good at writing. At the end of last year, she completed a play about women's issues called "The Widow's Home," which will be performed soon. Therefore, our conversation started with "The Widow's Home":

"I heard that Ms. Xia's 'The Widow's Home' will be staged soon."

"Yes, soon. These days I am looking for a troupe to perform it. Most of the people who play the roles are familiar to the audience, and I myself may be one of them—the plot of 'The Widow's Home' has been circling in my mind for I don't know how many years—" She has great confidence in this script. She earnestly told me in detail from the beginning how this story sprouted, how it affected her, and how it was finally written and prepared for performance. She said that she would make a detailed introduction of this process in the preface to "The Widow's Home," so I am happy to save a stroke here. Later, she also told me that she had thought about the whole thing in order to publish "The Widow's Home," because although she had the wish to print the book, she couldn't find the money to print it! As a result, she got a possible solution: to borrow money from the audience, and after the book is published, repay it with books or current assets plus interest. She is confident that this will be realized. In the end, whether things will succeed or not is not on the cards, but her spirit is commendable!

"Have you written any other scripts besides this one?"

"Yes, but I only wrote half of some of them and then abandoned them. Some are a bit scattered, and I have never bothered to sort them out, so I can't show them to people."

"What kind of work would you like to do in the future?"

"It's always nothing more than writing plays, acting, directing plays..." She seems to regard "drama" as supreme, and for drama, she can even sacrifice everything.

"Ah—however, maybe, in the end, you will become a virtuous wife and loving mother who specializes in housework!" I am sorry, it is probably not right to say such things.

At that time, she smiled naturally and said, "It won't happen. There are certainly many opportunities for me to do this, but at least for now, I like drama the most, and I don't think I will leave drama."

She likes to watch movies most in her spare time. Among the many plays she has performed, she likes "Miaofeng Mountain" the most.

As for her skills, everyone already knows them. Now we hope to see the premiere of her debut work as soon as possible.

### Rumors About Li Lihua's Marriage

— Wang Jun

Rumors Circulating Outside are Almost Comical

Recently, it has been rumored that Li Lihua is in love with the famous Peking opera actor Ji Yuliang, and there are even rumors about marriage. In order to understand the truth, the author made a special trip to Li Lihua's residence for an interview. According to Li Lihua herself, "Ji Yuliang and I are just very ordinary friends. He is a colleague of my mother, so naturally he knows me. As for someone saying that I often go in and out of cafes and other social places with him, it is really absurd. Now they are even saying that I am going to marry Ji Yuliang, which is completely nonsense."

At that time, Li's mother, Zhang Shaoquan, was also at home. According to what she told the author, "Would I marry my daughter to Ji Yuliang, who already has a wife and children? Where did that come from? I don't understand why they want to spread rumors. Moreover, Ji Yuliang has already left Shanghai, which proves that this rumor is absurd."

The author also asked, "Does Miss Li have any relationship with the Lihua Theater?" According to her, "There is no relationship at all. The manager of the theater, Mr. Li Yuyu, is also not acquainted with me."

Li Lihua has two new works, "Autumn" and "Han Shan Night Rain," which are being worked on at the Zhonglian General Factory and the Third Factory respectively. She is running around all day and is extremely busy, and there is no way to talk about anything else.

### Random Notes on the Entertainment Arts

— Liang Yu

In Shanghai's young amateur opera circles, two comets have been newly discovered in the female roles. One is Ni Chengbo from Liang She, who specializes in Qingyi and has a very strong voice. The other is Yu Qimei, who recently joined Golden Theater and formally went into professional acting. Yu has recently taken Wang Lanfang as her teacher and specializes in Huashan. According to people in the amateur opera circles, Yu Qimei's charming smile is second to none after Rong Boming. I have not seen her in action, but the other day when she played the empress in Er Jin Gong, she was exhausted and hoarse. I broke into a sweat for her. In the future, it is best to sing less of this kind of play that is not right for her skills.

Mr. Zhang Zhesheng's Tongchui Huahuasheng, except for his slightly lacking speech, can actually be compared to Wang Quankui (his use of nasal sounds is not as free as Wang Quankui, but his voice is wider and richer). Mr. Yang Dingxi, a famous amateur xiaosheng, told me earlier that Mr. Zhang's voice was once very hoarse, and only recently recovered slightly. It is suitable for short plays, but not for long and complicated ones. Recently, I listened to his Er Jin Gong, and did not expect that his voice was so good, flawless from beginning to end. Then I knew that there was no falsehood under a great reputation.

Sun Jinglu recently joined the Green Treasure Theater. All the supporting actors are still the old team from the Xuan Palace era. Due to the sweltering weather, and also because she has just given birth, Ms. Sun's appearance has thinned down, and her voice is also slightly lighter. Whether in appearance, speech, or acting skills, when talking about it now, what can be called "not-so-bad", and what can be called "four-not-whatever"? Not fat, not thin, not tepid, not fiery. And the spacious and comfortable armchair in the Green Treasure is also worth mentioning.

Jin Suwen is said to be succeeding Sun Jinglu at the Green Treasure, but Ms. Jin's personality makes her unsuitable for plays like "Sunrise." For the sake of business, her husband, Mr. Hu Tiwei, had better write a few scenes of "Tears and Laughter" for her to play, and include a scene of storytelling with a drum. Maybe it will be captivating.

### CZC Entertainment Enterprise Company Established

— Yi De

Including Drama, Dance, Opera, Music, Puppet Shows...

In countries with developed entertainment industries, large-scale companies invest heavily. In large cities in the United States, there are many such entertainment companies. On the one hand, they help the development of the entertainment industry, and on the other hand, they can gradually improve the quality of the entertainment programs.

In recent years, Shanghai's entertainment industry has been presenting a very prosperous phenomenon, but all are small-scale individual developments. No one has ever been willing to invest huge capital in the entertainment industry and operate on a larger scale, because it is not as easy to profit from speculative ventures. Now, there is exciting news for the entertainment industry: the recently established CZC Entertainment Enterprise Company is preparing to invest a large amount of capital to create a new look for Shanghai's entertainment industry.

CZC Company includes five sections: drama, dance, opera, music, and puppet shows, etc., concentrating the most outstanding actors in Shanghai, recruiting famous entertainment talents from China and abroad, and performing through cooperation. CZC Company is responsible for managing each section and regularly performs at famous theaters in the city.

Now, puppet shows are the first to be staged, which is a collaboration with the Jewish businessman Gao Tianlun. The drama section will also be performed in late July or early August at a major theater in the city with air-conditioning. All of Shanghai's first-class writers and directors are participating, and the actors already include Xia Xia, Lan Lan, Zhi Jun, Mei Cun, Gao Yang, and Tian Ran, among dozens of others. The opera, dance, music, and other sections responsible by Westerners are also progressing separately. The company has decided to invest the greatest human and material resources so that the entertainment industry can have a very noble and normal development under more affluent economic conditions.

### Sharing Weal and Woe

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Thunderbolt

For the sake of this will, a drastic change had taken place in 維城的’s mind. Firstly, the collection of Yuan Ji Xianren’s calligraphy and paintings had stopped; secondly, his own future, such as studying and employment, were all presented in a gloomy color; thirdly, none of the people in front of him were the ones he loved the most or were relatively loving. 維城 valued this will, as if a courtier in the feudal era had received the emperor’s sacred decree. From the Shuangmei Study, he held 釗 to the bedroom. Ye Da’s wife’s words were written on a eight-lined note with red lines. He was recalling: it was not clipped in the collection of books in the Shuangmei Study: it was found in a pile of old books and papers turned over in the attic. This was not written when his mother was critically ill; it was written when his mother was still quite healthy. Although the will would not specify a certain month and day, it could be guessed that the day must have been a long time ago.

It was midnight, and he was sitting upright alone. The cold wind outside the oyster window was howling with a hiss, and occasionally, a sharp strand of wind blew in from the gaps in the window, and the bean-like light flickered. He propped up his tired eyes and looked at the words on the will. The two characters 程炳 suddenly became particularly large, as large as a person's face, ferocious, fierce, ugly, floating on the paper. He gritted his teeth, clenched his fists, and was about to raise his hand, but there was nothing again. When he rubbed his eyelids and looked again, it was still his mother's handwriting, and there was no 程炳's face. He put the two characters 程炳 in his mouth and recited them, reciting them once and pounding his chest once,拍一下 the table. Later, the depression in his chest forced him to shout "程炳!" His eardrums suddenly heard his own shout, and his mind recovered. He thought that it was so late at night that the family would hear it, and they would be surprised. He did not want the family to be surprised, so he immediately blew out the fire and sat in the dark. (134)

Miscellaneous Talks on the Arts

### Puppet Show

— Ze Fu

It is said that puppet shows originated in the time of King Mu of Zhou. The Liezi Tangwen chapter says, "The dancer created by Yan Shi, when the string is pulled, they tap and sing in rhythm, and when their hands are held, they dance to the beat." However, the Liezi is a pseudo-book, and its saying is mostly allegorical, and it may not be credible. It is also said that they originated in the time of Emperor Gaozu of Han. The Yuefu Zalu says, "When Gaozu was in Pingcheng, he was surrounded by Modu. Chen Ping visited and learned that Guan Shi was jealous, so he created wooden puppets that used mechanisms to dance on the wall. Yue Yi said they were living people, and Modu was afraid of it, so he withdrew his troops." However, this saying is based on rumors and is not seen in historical books, so it is difficult to make people believe it. However, the Tongdian says, "Kuileizi made puppet shows, good at singing and dancing, originally music for funerals, and was first used in joyful gatherings at the end of the Han Dynasty." Then this play did exist in the Han Dynasty. However, in the beginning, it mostly focused on action. It did not become a formal drama until the Song Dynasty, so the performances also had stories. And there were many names, including "Suspended String Puppets," which are now called string puppets: "Staff Head Puppets," which seem to be those played by hand, now also called hand puppet shows: "Medicine-Powered Puppets," whose movements seem to be human-made and powered by music: "Flesh Puppets" are played by young children; "Water Puppets" are played on water. The Ming and Qing dynasties also called them palace plays because they were often performed in the palace. Today, only the first two types are still passed down to the world, and the latter three types are no longer heard of.

### Art Scene

— Zhi Yu

Li Yi's three-act comedy "Between Men and Women" will be performed by the Shanghai Art Troupe after it "sees the light again", and Yu Jin will be invited to direct it.
