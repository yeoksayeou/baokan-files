Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) – An officer from the Naval Press Department recently described to Domei News Agency reporters the course of the great naval battle off the Solomon Islands. According to reports, the results of this battle have annihilated the British and American fleets off Australia. The battle began on August 7th, when a joint British and American fleet, along with several transport ships, appeared off the Solomon Islands. Taking advantage of dense fog, they approached the islands and began landing on one island. Japanese reconnaissance planes discovered this and immediately reported it to the base. A Japanese fighter squadron was dispatched and engaged in a fierce aerial battle with enemy aircraft, shooting down forty-odd enemy fighters and nine bomber-fighters. At the same time, Japanese aircraft bombed and heavily damaged one enemy destroyer each. The enemy was in a state of chaos from the beginning. The next morning, Japanese torpedo planes approached the enemy fleet and launched a fierce attack, resulting in the sinking of the fleet flagship, the U.S. *Wichita*-class heavy cruiser, and a British-style heavy cruiser. At the same time, another heavy cruiser was severely damaged, and two light cruisers and destroyers were sunk. Another batch of Japanese torpedo planes simultaneously attacked enemy transport ships, sinking ten of them. At night, Japanese warships, planes, and submarines cooperated closely to launch a brave night attack on the heavily damaged enemy fleet, sinking the enemy's second flagship, the U.S. *Astoria*-class heavy cruiser, and six other heavy cruisers. In addition, one U.S. *Omaha*-class light cruiser and six destroyers were sunk, and two other destroyers were heavily damaged. On the third day of the battle, Japanese torpedo planes pursued the remnants of the enemy fleet and sank one *Achilles*-class light cruiser speeding towards Sydney. With the enemy fleet annihilated, only a small group of enemy land forces remained on one island in the Solomon Islands, their communications completely cut off, and without the assistance of transport ships or warships.

On Thursday morning, students began demonstrating and were dispersed by the police from all trams and vehicles belonging to British-owned bus companies. Passengers were forced to disembark and walk. This demonstration spread to all parts of the city, so the police could not stop it. Calcutta has been completely shut down, and the strikes by ironworkers and textile workers are expanding daily. Bombay, Pune, and Allahabad still experienced disturbances yesterday, with many deaths and arrests. The unrest in the city of Bombay seems to be calming down, but there are still fierce demonstrations outside the city, with demonstrators blocking streets and cutting cables.

### Roosevelt's Message to Congress: Adjusting U.S.-Panama Relations: Abandoning Debt Claims and Real Estate

Washington, 13th (Havas News Agency) – President Roosevelt sent a message to both houses of Congress today stating, "I believe the time has come for us to make some concessions to the Republic of Panama to satisfy their long-standing wishes. Such concessions are sufficient to correct certain factors that hinder the restoration of confidence and friendship between the two countries. This country previously borrowed 2.5 million U.S. dollars from my country to construct the Chorera-Rio-Hatai Highway. This highway is quite important for the defense of the Americas, so I request that both houses of Congress pass a resolution to write off this debt in one stroke and to declare the abandonment of all real estate in that country that is not needed to protect the Panama Canal. In addition, I ask members of both houses to note that Panama is fully cooperating with the United States in the current crisis. The relationship between the two countries is based entirely on acknowledging mutual benefits and fulfilling respective responsibilities.

### Large-Scale Battle Between German and Soviet Forces Between the Volga and Don Rivers; Stalingrad's Defenses are Strong; Voronezh Soviet Forces Launch Counteroffensive

Berlin, 13th (Domei News Agency) – According to an announcement from the German High Command, German forces attacking fiercely north of the Manych Canal have occupied Elista, the capital of the Kalmyk Autonomous Republic. The city has a population of approximately 250,000 and is located approximately 100 kilometers northeast of the eastern end of Lake Manych, on the straight line from Rostov to Astrakhan.

Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Reports just received from the front lines state that German forces have penetrated deep into the North Caucasus Mountains yesterday. German forces advanced along the Meykoup-Doubovsky railway and the Nevinomyssk branch line of the Baku-Rostov railway, reaching Chemarala in the upper reaches of the Kouban River. The place is sparsely populated, 60 kilometers from the east shore of Lake Manych. There was less war news on the Stalingrad line yesterday. However, the German war report yesterday mentioned the area between the Volga and Don rivers for the first time, indicating that the war has spread to that area. Soviet resistance remains extremely fierce, and reinforcements are arriving continuously, having built strong defenses to protect Stalingrad. However, German troops still made considerable progress yesterday. German forces in the Don River Bend can now move freely, and the Battle of Stalingrad is about to enter a new phase. The Soviet offensive in Voronezh and Yuqif can be described as fierce. Berlin believes that this may be a military counter-offensive launched by the Soviet Union itself to replace the Second Front in Western Europe.

Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced last night that the Soviet army started attacking the German position in the Voronezh area from August 11, but has made no progress. In an area north of the Voronezh bridgehead, as many as 111 Soviet tanks have been destroyed. At another point, the Soviet army advanced under cover of tanks, but 77 tanks were also destroyed.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 13th (Havas News Agency) – German forces are currently continuing to advance towards Novorossiysk and Grozny. Meanwhile, Romanian forces are continuing to advance along the Sea of Azov coast after clearing the remaining enemy north of the Kouban River. The war situation in each area is described as follows: After German forces occupied Slavyansk, they continued to advance southwest, having made contact with German forces west of Krasnodar. The Red Army is concentrating in the Troitskaya-Anapa-Novorossiysk triangle area. The Red Army, which holds the center of the Taman Peninsula, has been ordered to withdraw in order to defend western Caucasus. German forces coming from the north have reached the mouth of the Kouban River. All ports on the Sea of Azov have been occupied by German forces, including Port Achuev. However, the Red Army is still resisting in certain places, especially near the port of Yeysk. South of the city of Meykoup, German forces occupied the city of Antrougouskaya yesterday. There has been fierce fighting in the Grozny area in the past two days. Although the Red Army is resisting resolutely, it has been unable to stop the German advance. German forces occupied Garinovskaya, 20 miles north of Melros City, last night. Fierce fighting continues near the city of Ordzhonikidze. It is expected that the result of the war in that area will determine the fate of the Caucasus oil region. Last night, German forces also occupied Samankuk, 55 miles west of the city of Grozny, also one of the industrial centers of the Caucasus region. The battle between the Terek and Manych rivers has reached a critical stage. It has been confirmed that the city of Georgievsk has been occupied by German forces. Regarding the German occupation of Elista, the capital of the Kalmuk Autonomous Republic, between the Don and Manych rivers, it can be seen that the war in the area has shifted north. The German advance is rapid, and the Red Army's resistance in the Kalach area has collapsed. Fierce fighting continued in the Voronezh area today. The main battlefield is between the Don River and the Voronezh River.

German Forces Adopt Pincer Offensive, Continuing Advance into North Caucasus

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 13th (Havas News Agency) – German forces continue to advance in the Caucasus. German vanguard troops have now reached the vicinity of Novorossiysk and have approached the key city of Grozny. The base 25 miles northwest of the city has been occupied. East of Voloshilovgrad, after German forces crossed the Kalaus River, they occupied Alexandrovskaya the night before and continued to advance yesterday morning. They have now penetrated deep into enemy territory. Moschayaik on the banks of the Terek River has also fallen into the hands of the German forces. After occupying Troskaya on the 10th of this month, the mechanized units of the Axis forces in the Krasnodar region reached Kmyskaya, which is not connected to Novorossiysk, on the 12th and have come into contact with the main Soviet defense line. In general, the morale of the Red Army has declined, and its resistance is not as strong as before. German forces only encounter small mobile units of the Red Army. The main task of these units is to destroy oil field equipment. There is still a major battle south of Stalingrad. The front line stretches 10,000 miles from Kleiminskaya to Pyatiminiskaya. Although the Red Army resisted vigorously, German forces still made significant progress. German air forces launched strikes to bomb and strafe enemy concentration points and transportation lines, providing major assistance to the land army. The transport lines of enemy forces in the Volga River were also bombed. The remnants of the Red Army in the Kalach area have been wiped out, making it easier for German forces to attack Stalingrad. The battle for the city has now entered a decisive phase.

German Forces Use Camel Teams to Transport and Advance Towards the Key Soviet Port on the Caspian Sea

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Havas News Agency) – Daily summary war report from the Eastern Front: Astrakhan, the key Soviet port near the mouth of the Volga River on the Caspian Sea, is about to fall. The vanguard of German forces is only 160 miles from the port. Previously, German forces transported supplies only by camel and horse teams, but now they have reached truly Asian territory. Tanks and snake-shaped army vehicles can pass without hindrance. According to German reconnaissance reports, there are no Red Army concentrations between Elista and Astrakhan due to the difficulty of defense. Part of the Red Army previously concentrated in Astrakhan has been transferred north to reinforce the Stalingrad front. If Astrakhan falls, Stalingrad will also be lost. On the Stalingrad front, German forces are advancing from the northwest, and the city is in imminent danger. Yesterday, fighting was fierce along the Kotelnikovo-Stalingrad railway. German forces transferred tank units and motorized infantry reinforcements, but the Red Army's resistance has not weakened at all. According to reports from the Soviet side, German forces attempted to break through the Red Army's artillery line with the aid of dive bombers but were unsuccessful. They were repulsed to their original positions. The Red Army even counter-attacked successfully and consolidated several positions. In the Meykoup area, German sources claim that the main oil fields 30 miles south of the city have not yet been occupied. Reconnaissance reports indicate that the oil well area is engulfed in flames and difficult to approach. This is probably why German forces have been unable to occupy it for so long.

It was sailing east from the Port of Gibraltar. Upon receiving the report, the German and Italian air and naval forces jointly commenced operations.

As a result, the German and Italian navies sank one cruiser and three merchant ships, and the air force sank one cruiser, one destroyer, and three merchant ships. The German air and naval forces also sank the British aircraft carrier 'Eagle' and four merchant ships. One battleship and two aircraft carriers were hit multiple times, and several of them are likely beyond repair. In addition, thirty-two British aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. We also had thirteen aircraft missing and several carrying dead pilots. Most of the enemy merchant ships were forced to retreat to the Port of Gibraltar, and some docked at the Island of Malta, all of which were tracked and pursued by our air force."

Havas News Agency, Rome, 14th: The Italian High Command recently announced that the Axis air and naval forces have achieved further success in attacking the remnants of the enemy convoy in the Mediterranean. Our submarines and small destroyer squadrons sank an enemy cruiser, two destroyers, and three merchant ships.

Other sailors have landed on the coast of Tunisia. German and Italian pursuit aircraft also shot down ten enemy aircraft. The Axis forces lost a total of nineteen aircraft, and two medium-sized submarines were damaged, one more severely.

Eyewitness Account of the Sinking of the "Eagle"

Havas News Agency, London, 13th: Regarding the sinking of the British aircraft carrier "Eagle," a Reuters correspondent who was on board recounted his eyewitness account, stating that shortly after 1:00 PM, he was sitting in a room with three officers when suddenly two loud explosions knocked them to the ground. Then there were two more explosions, shaking the entire ship. He heard the hissing of steam, swirling around the ship, and the hull tilted sharply. Bombs on the ship came loose and began to slide along the deck. A Hurricane fighter plane broke its moorings and crashed into a group of sailors, none of whom survived. The correspondent, along with many other sailors, jumped into the sea. The waves were rough, but the correspondent managed to climb onto a cork-made buoy, which already held twelve people. Turning around, the correspondent saw the "Eagle" two hundred yards behind him, completely capsized. Sailors were frantically leaving the ship, and the sound of depth charge explosions was incessant. These were launched by our destroyer squadron in an attempt to destroy the Axis submarine responsible. Then there was a commotion, and he saw that where the "Eagle" had been, there was only a splash of water.

British Ships Gather in Gibraltar

French Postal Aircraft Caught in the Crossfire

Havas News Agency, Algiers, North Africa, 13th: During the major air and sea battle between Britain and Germany in the Mediterranean yesterday, four destroyer aircraft from an unknown country attacked a French postal aircraft traveling between Marseille and Algiers, resulting in the deaths of two passengers and injuries to six. It is reported that the pilot of this seaplane saw four military aircraft near the coast of Algeria at 12:30 PM yesterday, seemingly patrolling the area. The plane immediately flew elsewhere to avoid flying near the patrol zone and being mistaken for an aircraft of a belligerent country. Unexpectedly, these patrol aircraft mistook the plane for attempting to escape and immediately flew to pursue it. One of them opened fire first, hitting the French aircraft with no less than one hundred bullets. Two of the four engines were damaged. The pilot immediately made a direct landing, almost touching the waves. The attackers, believing that the plane had already sunk, stopped firing and resumed patrolling as usual. This damaged French aircraft was able to reach here. Two of the passengers died, one of whom was a young woman, and four were injured. Two of the pilots were also injured. It is reported that these aircraft of the belligerent country were attacking from below, so the injured were all wounded in the lower body. They are now receiving treatment.

### Sending Relief to the Poor in This City: Applications Started Yesterday, Providing Travel Expenses to Facilitate the Return of Civilians to Their Hometowns

The Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee, in consultation with the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee, is actively handling repatriation and relief matters, as reported in this newspaper. Here are the details of the relief measures: The relief standard is that for poor people returning to their hometowns from Shanghai, if the amount of 30% of the total travel expenses is less than 25 yuan, each person will be subsidized 30% of the total travel expenses. If the amount of 30% of the total travel expenses exceeds 25 yuan, each person will be subsidized 25 yuan. However, because the prices of train and boat tickets from Shanghai to one destination vary among travel agencies, in order to unify and facilitate calculations, a standard amount of subsidy for travel expenses to the destinations of poor people returning to their hometowns has been formulated in accordance with the aforementioned standards, based on the distance of the journey and the amount of travel expenses, as follows: 3 yuan for Chuansha, Baoshan, Nanhui, Luodian, Songjiang and other districts under the jurisdiction of Shanghai City; 4 yuan for the Kunshan area from Shanghai; 5 yuan for Jiaxing and Wuxi from Shanghai; 10 yuan for Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, Zhenjiang, and Jiangyin from Shanghai; 13 yuan for the Jiangbei area of Yangzhou from Shanghai; 15 yuan for Nanjing, Pukou, and Wuhu from Shanghai; 20 yuan for Bengbu and Qingdao from Shanghai; 25 yuan for Xuzhou, Hankou, Xiamen-Chaozhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou from Shanghai.

Implementation Measures

The branch committee will print repatriation application forms and relief tickets and send them to the Chinese Evacuation Committee for use. Poor people returning to their hometowns from Shanghai who need assistance should first fill out an application form at the Chinese Evacuation Committee, find an introducer and a guarantor, and after being deemed qualified by the committee, a notice of approval will be issued and a relief ticket will be issued temporarily. The committee's seal will be affixed to the relief ticket. The returning person will present the pass and relief ticket to the branch committee for verification. The branch committee will affix its seal to the relief ticket, and the returning person will affix their seal or right thumbprint. The relief ticket will then be collected and kept for future reference. Then, in accordance with the amount filled in on the relief ticket, the subsidy will be issued to the returning person. At the same time, the pass will be returned, with a blue stamp "Subsidized by the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee" affixed to the back. The Chinese Evacuation Committee shall send a list of the number of relief tickets filled out and the amount approved each day to the branch committee for future reference. The branch committee shall compile a semi-monthly report listing the number of relief tickets collected and the amount disbursed each day and submit it to the Relief Committee for future reference. A list of poor people repatriated with relief shall be compiled based on the relief tickets collected. This batch of relief for repatriation is limited to the period from August to September 14. If necessary, social forces will be engaged to raise funds separately.

### Implementation of Epidemic Prevention Injections in the Two Concessions: Over 2.5 Million People; French Concession Adds Injection Teams, with Over 1,900 Cases of Infection

The Shanghai Times reports that the French Concession Health Department yesterday (the 13th) added personnel to administer epidemic prevention injections to residents on the streets. Seven injection sites were added at street corners from the Bund to Avenue Haig. However, it was reported that due to the commemoration of August 13th and the city's state of alert, the injection work was somewhat relaxed.

Official sources reported that the total number of injections in the two concessions from March to Wednesday of this week was 2,551,652. Of these, 1,422,939 were in the International Settlement, and 1,128,713 were in the French Concession. The number of injections on Wednesday was 34,133 in the International Settlement and 30,435 in the French Concession.

The injection teams added by the French Concession for street injections were all located in densely populated areas, such as in front of the Great World amusement park on Rue du Père Robert, in front of the Avenue Joffre fire station, at the corner of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre, and at the corner of Avenue Albert and Route Paul Henry. The remaining sites were located in the area of Avenue Haig and Rue de la Caserne.

The French Concession health authorities revealed that the Health Department has requested the French police to take advantage of the commemorative security measures for the Shanghai War to inspect the epidemic prevention certificates of pedestrians entering and leaving the French Concession. This measure is easier to implement because many roads are closed, leaving only important thoroughfares open for traffic.

Since July, the total number of tiger epidemic reports received by the municipal health authorities has reached 1,951. The highest number of cases occurred in the Chinese areas, totaling 1,244, with 231 deaths; 368 cases in the French Concession, with 53 deaths; and 349 cases in the International Settlement, with 69 deaths.

Commercial News

### Although the Pull of Retail Investors Is Not Weak, Public Bonds Are Ultimately Subdued by Physical Goods

Yesterday, the market conditions for unified public bonds were sluggish and continued to soften. Due to the tightening of credit, the potential of the bulls inevitably declined. People's minds were thus unsettled, and the floating longs seemed unstable. In addition, the outflow of physical goods was the biggest reason for hindering the interest of buyers. Therefore, when the market opened in the morning, although Category C was already showing signs of fatigue, it once saw a high price of over 9.60 yuan due to the pulling of retail investors. Later, as large investors emerged and floating longs pushed the market down, the selling pressure was strong for a time, and the market lacked support and was ultimately subdued. Judging from the trend, it was the dumping by large investors, which was not without its factors, and the pulling power of buyers seemed not weak. Therefore, if the outflow of physical goods can be slightly reduced, the market will not be seen to decline sharply. Otherwise, if sales continue to increase, there is still the possibility of a slight decline. The overall market buying and selling was once lifted by Tongsheng, Lianyi, Tongyu, Xinfeng, Tongli, Hongda, etc., and Category C saw a high price of 9.60 yuan. Afterward, as large and medium-sized lots emerged, along with the late selling by Lianhe, Yuanhe, Yuxin, Tonghe, etc., the market state was unable to rise, and was ultimately forced down. As a result, the prices uniformly fell by 2 to 8 jiao. The transaction volume was about 2.5 million yuan. The details are listed below.

### Most Chinese Stocks Fell, Few Rose; Trading Still Feels Brisk

Yesterday, the market conditions for Chinese stocks were mixed. Because Zhabei Water and Electricity was under selling pressure, the decline was very sharp, with a 2 yuan decline, falling from 35 yuan to 33 yuan, ultimately falling 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The Philippines Business atmosphere followed the decline by half a yuan. Department stores Wing On and Sincere reduced by 2.5 yuan. Due to the excessive decline before the holiday, underwear was absorbed by strong players, and rose by 2.5 jiao. Culture stock China Bookstore had few buyers, and unexpectedly fell to within 180 yuan, down 7.5 yuan. World fell 5 yuan. Commercial Press uniquely received the favor of buyers, and rose by 2.5 yuan. New pharmaceuticals only Sino-French fell another 1.5 yuan, and the rest turned firm. New Asia rose 2.5 jiao, Minyi rose 2.5 yuan, and Ning Shao Shipping reached a maximum of 78 yuan on the news of favorable buying, with buyers active. Despite the confused state of mind of all parties, transactions were not scarce. The stock prices are recorded below.

In the midst of the thriving Chinese stock business, financial and industrial figures in this city, such as Li Zuxun and Zhu Haichu, have recently initiated the organization of the Dagong Stock Company, located at No. 190, Dongya Building, Sichuan Road, which is about to open.

### Settlement of Tobacco and Sugar Is Very Cumbersome, Military Tickets Continue to Rise

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw Japanese military tickets continue to rise, as the inventory of the same industry has been limited recently. The settlement of cigarettes has not been cleared, and sugar merchants have come to settle. Moreover, the commission for settlement and transportation to banks also requires about 5.58 yuan, so it has risen to 5.5567 yuan, causing banks and small money shops to sell at 5.565 yuan in the market, but the purchase is still 5.545 yuan, and some say 5.55 yuan.

### Ornament Gold Still Suspends at the Original Price; Prices of the Same Industry Doing Business with Each Other Recover Firmly

Yesterday, the market price of jewelry gold at Dashin and other jewelry shops in this city was still 2,200 yuan per tael (350 yuan less for purchase). The market selling price of cash shops was also suspended at 2,200 yuan, and the purchase price was suspended at 2,000 yuan, but in fact it had to be reduced by 300 yuan. The prices of the same industry doing business with each other recovered firmly. In the morning, the price was as high as 10 yuan per tael, at 1,940 yuan. In an instant, it rose 20 yuan in buying, to 1,960 yuan, but soon saw a pullback, falling to 1,940 yuan. At noon, it was 1,945 yuan, up 15 yuan compared to the previous day, with a high and low of 20 yuan. Transaction volume recovered rarely. The price of patterned silver for jewelry was still suspended at 16 yuan per tael, and the price for the same industry to do business with each other was 11.23 yuan.

### There Is Still Searching and Gathering for Piece Goods

Yesterday's cloth market in Dongpi, although the rise was mostly hovering, a certain gang still took extra care to search and gather.

### Wheat Bran Inventory Is Low, Prices Are High

Yam and Dried Goods Are Mainly Rising

The supply and demand of beans is still balanced, and the market continues to show little change. Yesterday, 50 bags of Tianjin green soybeans opened at a price of 230 yuan, and 20 bags of red beans opened at a price of 167 yuan.

Recently, due to the scarcity of goods in the production area, those who hold yam and dried goods are all trying to push prices up, and the market is rising. Yesterday, more than 20 bags of Shandong yam and dried goods in single-line bags opened at a price of 108 yuan, and 40 bags of Qingdao yam and dried goods opened at a price of 120.05 yuan, including burlap bags.

The domestic sales of bean cakes are still sluggish, and the market is stable. It is estimated that 200 pieces of Xingji bean cakes for April from Wangu stack opened at a price of 62 yuan, and 500 pieces for May opened at a price of 62.25 yuan.

The market inventory of wheat bran is decreasing day by day, and people's minds are quite cheerful. Sanyin small bags of wheat bran from the countryside opened at a price of 102 yuan for the month of April from a certain village assistance agency, up another 2 yuan compared to before.

### Sugar Prices See Decline

However, (August 13th) is the 5th anniversary of the Shanghai War, and the association is closed, while the demand from industry insiders is more urgent, so they bought at low prices, and a total of 1,000 bags were traded, and the trend was stable.

### Hoarding and Absorption Are Active, and the Rise in Cigarette Prices Resumes

Under the hoarding of cigarettes by hoarders and the pulling by speculators, market prices have suddenly become tight, and buyers want to choose new goods, and few ask about old goods. Due to the scarcity of Japanese cigarettes, the market is following the rise, with Daying brand cigarettes at 8,500 yuan, Old Sword brand at 5,650 yuan, Pinhai brand at 5,000 yuan, Wuhua brand at 3,700 yuan, and Fairy brand at 4,100 yuan, up more than 100 yuan compared to before.

Looking for Old Woman Chen Shen

Although the woman is old, she walks as strongly as a middle-aged person, and is absolutely not dragon-bellied, so she should not have suffered an accident. Six or seven days have passed, and the family is in a state of anxiety. At that time, she was wearing an old Xiangyun gauze shirt, black pants, blue cloth socks, and pointed black shoes. If she is lost, we hope that a kind gentleman has taken her in at his residence. Please accompany her to No. 226 Junqing Road, telephone 36575, so that family members can reunite. We will be infinitely grateful.

### Zhang Bei, a Woman with a Husband's Demeanor

— Weiren

Zhang Bei, this girl from the north, is a new face on the Shanghai stage in 1942. She is twenty-two years old this year, from Xi'an. Her father has passed away, and she only has a mother and an elder brother at home. When she was eight years old, she went to Nanjing to study. During her student days, she was most interested in the Chinese language course, so her writing now is also very fluent and expressive. At the age of eighteen, she was in the second year of high school at Nanjing Huiwen Girls' High School, but because of the outbreak of war, she painfully left the place where she had lived for ten years and returned to her hometown of Xi'an.

At this time, Dai Ya, the person in charge of the China Drama Society, was also performing dramas at the Yisushe Theater in Xi'an. She simply felt a love for "drama" and joined the theater's performance. Her first play was "Yeguang Cup," in which she played the heroine Lili. Her performance was very successful, and the local media unanimously recommended it. The theater's performances were for voluntary donations, and the highest ticket price was sold for 60 yuan. "Yeguang Cup" was performed for half a month, and the box office results were always around 80% to 90%.

Later, she also performed the solo drama "Military Horn." In "Military Horn," she acted with Bai Yun, which can also be said to be Bai Yun's debut on stage. Then, she followed the traveling theater troupe led by Ding Ling to perform in the countryside of Xi'an. The plays performed included "Attack," "Put Down Your Whip," "Blind Mute Hatred," and "Black Hell." At that time, Mei Xi's wife, Mo Yang Hongying, was also hanging out with her.

She left Xi'an and traveled through Kunming, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong to Shanghai. She didn't come to Shanghai to act, but after the outbreak of the Pacific War, she separated from her brother and stayed in Shanghai alone.

When Hongbao was established, Mei Xi invited her to act, so she showed her face on the stage in Shanghai. -- Di Siniang in "Returning Soul Incense," Marie in "Camellia Girl," Chen Bailu in "Sunrise," and the Second Madam in "Three Smiles." In four months, she has performed various different characters with various identities and personalities.

Now she has been recruited by Lüyi, and her first play is playing Yao Dajie in "In Spring," which is another kind of bold and straightforward style.

This girl from the north has a husband's demeanor. She means what she says and doesn't beat around the bush, so she lacks training and cultivation in dealing with people and the art of living.

### A Record of Cool Summer Singing (3)

— Su Shaoqing

After Song Dezhu and her classmates arrived in Shanghai after being hired by the New Stage, Mr. Lu Xu Chen Huang and others from the Shanghai drama circle prepared wine feasts one after another to wash away the dust for them. I sat in on all of them. Dezhu's face is beautiful and her figure is slender. She doesn't look like someone who performs martial arts with swords and horses. When I saw her drinking very boldly, drinking several large glasses in a row without getting drunk, I realized that I have been accumulating grievances in my heart for years, and my stomach for alcohol is quite wide. Whenever I meet good friends, I never refuse to get drunk. That day, Dezhu repeatedly raised her glass to toast the guests, and the guests were all defeated. I also retreated three houses. It is said that I have stomach and intestinal problems now, and I don't dare to drink too much. In the past, there was no such news. I could drink ten catties of Shaoxing wine. From this point of view, I know that she has a gentle appearance but contains boldness inside. It is appropriate for her to end up on stage, agile and heroic, with the momentum of attacking the wind and sweeping. I asked, "Ten years ago, when I traveled to Beiping, I visited the drama school. In the south room of the backyard, I was practicing martial arts. A table and a stool were set up in the courtyard, and the old actor Yu Yuqin was telling the play. Standing next to the table were two or three children listening. Who was that?" Dezhu said, "At that time, that child was me." Guan Deqi said, "Those who practiced martial arts were us." Only ten years have passed, and those who were children at the time have all become famous. Time really flies like an arrow leaving the string.

Cao Xianlin, Li Huifang, etc. sang Qing at the banquet. Mr. Wu Guozhang, head of the Rishe box office, and the owner of Meihua Pavilion sent invitations. I arrived the latest and saw old friends I hadn't seen for many years were all in attendance. The owner of Meihua Pavilion introduced two women, one Cao Huilin, who specializes in Qingyi, and one Li Huifang, who specializes in Tan-style old men. They are both big stage roles. Song Dezhu and Li Hehui were also in the guest seats. In the middle of the happy drinking, someone proposed that everyone present must sing a passage. Those who do not sing will be fined three large cups of wine. Song and Li suddenly left. People in the pear orchard have a custom of not liking to sing Qing in restaurants and restaurants. Also, Renewal happened to be the first day that Song Zi et al. performed on stage, so it is appropriate to reserve their voices, so they escaped the feast and should be forgiven. So Li Huifang sang first, singing four lines of the Erhuang Yuanban "For the Country" from Hongyang Cave. Her voice was very good. In my drunken eyes, I saw that her body was quite tall and had a healthy beauty. Among the Kun-style old men, it is rare to find such a talent, but I think her voice is not very suitable for Tan tunes. I listened to Mr. Yuan Ludeng sing. Mr. Yuan Ludeng sang, and the teacher never refused to sing a passage of "Zhang Gongdao is Thirty-Five or Six Sons Have a Backing." He had a peaceful attitude and was a Jiangzuo Ruitian. Next, his son Senzhai sang four lines of the Lianhuan Tao, and then all the friends who sang well sang. Next, Mr. Gu Ziyan sang a passage of the Red Net "Dang Cao." Next, Ms. Cao Huilin sang four lines of "Er De Fu" from Fenhe Bay. The tune was studied in the Cheng style, and it had a great flavor. Her attitude was also beautiful. This beautiful woman has clear facial features, especially beautiful eyebrows, and has extraordinary intelligence. It will not be difficult to soar in the future. She has very good relationships, and there are many people who support her. Next, Mr. Xu Xiaolin sang a passage of "Listen to His Words." I studied with him ten years ago, and he still has a typical style. After that, the friends urged me to sing "One Round of Bright Moon" from the inn. I couldn't refuse, so I reluctantly accepted the order. I had to set the soft work to tune the strings, and I could still handle it. After singing, the friends didn't let me stop, and ordered me to sing "Listen to Qiao Lou," and ordered me to sing "Watch the Thief." After singing, I was sweating like rain, and the friends were very happy and praised me. My voice was not good after drinking, and I felt even more ashamed. (End). Liu Binkun, Furongcao, Yu Zhenfei, and other famous actors, as well as Weng Ouhong, Sun Lanting, Wang Gongjun, Jin Ciquan, He Haisheng, etc., were all assembled together, to the extreme of the joys of cup wine. They immediately invited all the students to visit the rehearsal of Da Tie Long Shan, and invited Mr. Weng Ouhong to give a speech. It was not until the sun set in the west that they dispersed happily. It is heard that the school plans to hire each of the famous actors as a counselor, to teach one or two classes per week. Mr. Li also plans to go north to inspect the organization of the classes in the birthplace of old plays, in order to improve the school.

### Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai

— Lan Ying

"Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" is a folk tale known to all, young and old. In the minds of most people, it may be considered inappropriate to stage such a play. However, if we want to promote popular drama, "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" is indeed good material. If handled well, it can assist in semi-popular education. This time, Mr. Fang Yi has followed up "Four Sisters" by writing "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" as an attempt to practice popularizing and making drama accessible. The play has five acts and nine scenes. Zhu Yingtai in the play does not have the idea of ​​breaking away from the family to create a free new life, like Juehui and Shuying in "Home". Her going out is only based on her own emotions and wanting to breathe in some fresh air. "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" points out the equality of the instinct for seeking knowledge between men and women, and the lack of freedom in love at that time. The playwright uses a beautiful and passionate poem, using lyrical techniques to introduce this folk tale, removing all the unreasonable mythological parts, such as the souls transforming into butterflies, and ending it with Liang's death. It is a complete tragedy.

### Li Songling to Go North for Investigation

— Man Zi

Li Songling, Chairman of the China National Opera School, hosted a banquet at his residence, the Maoling Villa of Fuli Lizhi, the day before yesterday (the 13th) to entertain Zhao Ruquan, Lin Shusen, Chu Jinping, Liu Wenkui, and Han Jinkui. "Roses Bloom Everywhere" imitates the expressions of Qiu Xia and Gu Yeke. Amateur Puppet Troupe performs "Primitive Man".

Local educators, deeply aware of the profound impact of puppet drama on children's education, have initiated and organized the Shanghai Amateur Puppet Troupe, which has been established. The script for "Primitive Man" has been arranged and will be publicly performed soon. The artist Yu Zheguang will serve as the director. The play has been performed by the Middle School Children's Education Society in Shanghai and other places, and has been well-received. This time, in pursuit of excellence, everything from props, dubbing, to lighting will be perfect, and it will be a unique sight for the academic community.

### Chatting with Huang Zongying: Discussing the Content of "Mandarin Duck Sword"

— Yi Qing

Everyone is wondering why Huang Zongying is listed in the cast in the "Human World" program, but never appears on stage. In fact, Huang Zongying does appear. When Shali opens the curtains and Huang Zongjiang is arguing with many female workers, she is one of them. This is because in the Hua Yi's repertoire, regardless of importance, basic actors must participate in the performances. For example, Liu Jin, one of the main characters in "Human World," will perform as a palace maid in "Mandarin Duck Sword."

By chance, I had a conversation with Huang Zongying for more than 20 minutes in Hua Yi's rehearsal room. She was sweating and wearing ancient costumes, practicing the movements of a character in the "Mandarin Duck Sword" play, so the questions and answers were brief:

"After "Dai Zhan" in "Except for Wang Baochuan" and "Xiang Fei" in "Consort Xiang," this is the third time I've acted in a historical drama. It's really hard to act in historical dramas in hot weather..."

"However, in this hot weather, rehearsing and performing don't feel that terrible. What I'm afraid of is that the results of the performance will not satisfy the audience who come to see the play in the heat."

"I've read "Casting Love," and I've also watched "Casting Love." Both times, I was so moved that I shed tears. This time, the "Mandarin Duck Sword" being rehearsed, according to Mr. Yao Ke, is like an ancient Chinese "Casting Love." I'm really worried about whether I can play it well!"

"What kind of story is 'Mandarin Duck Sword'?" I asked:

"It tells the tragedy of the Degraded People in the Ming Dynasty. The Degraded People were oppressed by traditional racial concepts, not allowed to study, not allowed to change careers, and not allowed to marry non-Degraded People. There was a rich son among the Degraded People who used a false surname and diligently studied, preparing to stand up for the Degraded People. He privately got engaged to a girl with a pair of Mandarin Duck Swords. Unexpectedly, their secret was discovered. The young man committed suicide with the male sword, and the girl also stabbed herself in the abdomen with the female sword."

This is indeed an ancient Chinese "Casting Love"!

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What Can Be Done?

Although He Zixing was unable to bring back the master and servant of Wei Cheng, after He Zixing's inquiry, he learned that they had gone to Shanghai. This was no small contribution, and the Second Madam Ye could not help but comfort him and tell him to go to the kitchen to wash his feet and have dinner. Then she said to Cuizhen, "If Wei Cheng couldn't find his siblings, he should have come back. Why did they have to go to Shanghai?" Cuizhen couldn't guess the reason. She only came up with one idea: when they return from Shanghai, they will definitely return on Hong Qizhang's boat. He Zixing and Xu Jin'er, two farmhands, should go to Huagang every day to inquire when Hong Qizhang will return to Huagang. The Second Madam Ye thought this was a good idea and immediately summoned Magpie to tell He Zixing and Xu Jinfu to go to Huagang every day. Xu Jinfu felt that Ah Yu had gone out with the young master, and He Zixing had also been to Shuangqiao once, but he had not contributed anything, which made him feel inferior. So he went to Huagang Town once overnight, but it was still in vain. He didn't see Zhang Shurong, nor did he see Zhang Shurong's boat.

It wasn't until the evening two days after He Zixing went to Shuangqiao that Wei Cheng and Ah Xing returned on Zhang Qiaorong's boat. The Second Madam Ye was overjoyed, looking at Wei Cheng as if he had been kidnapped by bandits and now released unconditionally. While Wei Cheng was having dinner, he told the Second Madam Ye about his visit to Old Madam Chen in Shuangqiao. The Second Madam Ye said, "He Zixing has already been to Shuangqiao. We know some things about Shuangqiao. The Chen siblings were not at home. Why did you go directly to Shanghai from Shuangqiao?" Wei Cheng said, "My purpose was to find Guoqi and Guofang. Since they weren't in Shuangqiao, I had to go to Shanghai. I also asked their old grandmother a question." The Second Madam Ye looked around the room and smiled, "We're all family, there's no one else here." Wei Cheng finished a bowl of rice and said, "I need to rest. I'll talk later." (155)
