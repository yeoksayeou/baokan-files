Argentine Capital, 11th (Allied News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department today acknowledged that in the Solomon Islands battle in the Coral Sea, the U.S. lost one cruiser, and two cruisers, two destroyers, and one transport ship were damaged. The report on this battle is incomplete, and London has not yet made any announcements regarding this naval and air battle. It is reported that fierce fighting is still in progress.

Lisbon, 11th (Haitong News Agency): Chief of Naval Operations King issued the first official communiqué last night in Washington regarding the Solomon Islands battle, concluding, "Considerable losses are expected." The communiqué explained that the battle was very difficult and complex, so losses were unavoidable.

Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency): U.S. Fleet Commander King issued a report on the Solomon Islands sea battle on the 10th as follows: The battle near the Solomon Islands has lasted for three days and is still continuing. The sea battle is under the overall command of Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and directly commanded by Vice Admiral Ghormley, Commander of the South Pacific Joint Forces.

Argentine Capital, 10th (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department issued a report on the Solomon Islands sea battle on the 9th, stating that the U.S. military operations against Japan are still continuing. The U.S. Navy encountered strong resistance from the Japanese forces. The results of losses on both sides have not yet reached the point of being announced. According to a United Press New York dispatch, after reporting on the Solomon Islands sea battle, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz also appealed to the American people to have a deep understanding of the severity of the battle situation, and requested the people to give the military great assistance.

Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency): According to a Washington message, the U.S. Department of the Army has announced the names of 77 American soldiers missing in action in the Pacific, mostly airmen, including 10 officers and 27 soldiers missing in action in Alaska, 5 officers and 20 soldiers missing in action in Midway, and 6 soldiers missing in action in Hawaii.

Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. naval authorities announced that U.S. naval and air forces attacked the Japanese-occupied Western Aleutian Islands on the 8th. According to this report, it is different from past false propaganda; it does not mention a word about the results of the battle, and the reporting agencies in the U.S. and the U.K. only state that the details are unclear. A San Francisco broadcast claimed that the attack has ended, but the results cannot be known until the U.S. troops return to base, and it will take two weeks to determine.

Kamada Reveals Japanese Navy's Night Battle Victory Yesterday

Allied News Agency, Local Report: Japanese Navy Spokesman Colonel Kamada stated yesterday while receiving reporters that the reason for the U.S. Navy's rapid defeat in the Solomon Islands battle was because the battle occurred at night. Colonel Kamada revealed for the first time that the battle occurred at night, and said that this naval battle has completely exposed the U.S. Navy's weakness in this regard. The U.S. fleet was quite surprised to suddenly encounter Japanese ships because what they expected was to deal with Japanese air raids. Many U.S. ships did not even have time to aim their guns at the Japanese ships, which shows that it was a complete surprise. As a result, the Japanese ships broke through the U.S. transport lines and inflicted heavy damage. The U.S. fleet's night battle training was poor, which completely put them at a disadvantage. To win in night battles, all crew members must undergo rigorous training, but the U.S. side was not suitable for night battles because their ships lacked searchlights. Due to the Allied powers' deliberate distortion of propaganda, it is clear that they still underestimate the strength of the Japanese Navy. The Allied side has suffered defeats in the past, but still stubbornly underestimates the strength of the Japanese Navy, which must be due to the fact that U.S. officers and soldiers do not know the truth about the past defeats. In response to questions, Colonel Kamada further revealed that the fleets were extremely close when they engaged in battle, and sometimes the warships almost collided.

### Prominent Japanese Naval Expert Explains Significance of Solomon Islands Sea Battle

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency): Renowned Japanese naval commentator Masanori Ito recently commented on the significance and great results of the Solomon Islands sea battle, stating that the enemy had proclaimed Australia as the only remaining base for offensives against Japan in the Pacific, pinning their last hope on Australia, thinking that it might be possible to reverse the entire Pacific war situation. However, our imperial army finally subdued the Solomon Islands, which are located to the east of Australia and New Guinea, and are a vital hub for U.S. and Australian maritime communications. Recently, our navy attacked the Arafura Sea to the northwest of it, making the situation of the isolated Australia even more difficult, proving that the talk of an offensive against Japan is just an illusion. As a result of despair and anxiety, the British and Americans believe that it is necessary to strengthen Australia's defense and transport a large number of U.S. Army troops. According to announcements, their transport team consists of one battleship, seven or more Class A cruisers, three or more Class B cruisers, and six or more destroyers, and is accompanied by a strong escort fleet. From their all-out efforts to protect it, we can infer that there are more than ten transport ships, carrying a considerable number of large units. The United States is betting everything, as can be seen from the general situation. The strength of the U.S. escort fleet this time can be said to be unprecedented. The strength of the British escort fleet that was bombed by Italy in the Mediterranean was only half of this time. After the U.S. aircraft carrier was bombed and destroyed by us, only three remain. The reason why no aircraft carrier was deployed in this escort fleet is precisely because of this. The greatness of the results achieved by our army in this naval battle exceeds the battles of Hawaii and Malaya. In this battle, the enemy had one battleship and seven Class A cruisers damaged. This is indeed a wound that the U.S. cannot quickly recover. What we should emphasize now is this. The destruction of the U.S. escort fleet will have a profound impact on the transportation of ground troops for combat in the future. In terms of opening up a second front in Europe, the transportation of ground troops by sea is a prerequisite. This was the first time that the British and Americans had cooperated in transporting troops, and it was destroyed in one fell swoop, defeated without a fight. The elite of the U.S. Army on the transport ships has suffered a terrible fate, so this defeat not only severely damaged the British and American navies, but also inflicted a painful blow on their armies and people. The U.S. Army units that the United States boasts of suffered a setback in their first operation against Japan, so the second front will forever become an unattainable dream, it can be asserted.

### Extremely Chaotic Situation in India; Civilian-Police Clashes Unceasing, with Numerous Deaths and Injuries; Mumbai, New Delhi, and Three Other Cities Are the Most Severely Affected

Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency): According to reliable sources, the anti-British struggles in India are intensifying. The anti-British struggles of the people in Mumbai, Lucknow, Kolkata, New Delhi, and other places have spread to the entire country. The situation in various places is described as follows: Mumbai citizens attacked railway stations on the morning of the 10th, and clashed with police teams, with more than 20 people injured. The people were very indignant at the authorities' violent suppression, so they attacked police teams, damaged telegraph and telephone lines, and post offices. When the police were dispatched to suppress the unrest, they clashed with the people everywhere and opened fire. On the 10th alone, 11 citizens died and 49 were injured. On the police side, 91 people were injured. In Lucknow, students held demonstrations and threw bricks and tiles at the police. Ahmedabad Gujarat University held a rally against the arrest of Gandhi. Indian university students clashed with the police. British troops were dispatched to suppress the unrest. In New Delhi, the people wanted to destroy the Governor-General's residence, and clashed with the police. Workers at the jute mills in Kolkata have begun to strike. On the morning of the 10th in Pune, a large number of citizens gathered around the Aga Khan Palace, where Gandhi and others were detained. The police wanted to disperse the crowd and opened fire, resulting in a bloody battle with the people. At that time, the crowd threw stones at the suppressing troops. Another group of people wanted to gather at the city's Kuomintang branch to hold an anti-British rally. The police opened fire to interfere, and several people were injured. In short, the anti-British struggle in India is raging like wildfire and has spread throughout India. Although the British have banned gatherings, arrested key figures, and dispatched police and troops to suppress the unrest, it is to no avail. The situation is serious and has reached its peak.

Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency): The situation in India is deteriorating daily. In Mumbai alone, 15 people have died and 169 have been injured in the two days of Sunday and Monday. The number of deaths and injuries throughout the country is increasing with time. A curfew has been implemented in northern Mumbai. Police are stationed at all stations to prevent National Congress activities. The ban has been extended to Bengal, Madras, and Mysore. Workers at several yarn factories in Kolkata went on strike yesterday. The Dadar oil depot was set on fire and burned. The Mumbai-Baroda and Central India railways were disrupted by students yesterday, and were once unable to operate. Many store windows in New Delhi were smashed, but Old Delhi and New Delhi were relatively peaceful yesterday.

Mumbai, 10th (Havas News Agency): The situation in India has not calmed down today. In many places, there have been continued clashes between the people and the police, especially in the three cities of Mumbai, Lucknow, and New Delhi. The details are as follows: In Mumbai, the people attacked the Tardeo railway station in an attempt to cut off traffic between the city and the suburbs. The police drove the rioters out of the station, but they gathered in the nearby square and moved a large number of oil drums from the station, piling them up in the streets in an attempt to block traffic. At the same time, they threw stones at the police, and the police immediately opened fire in retaliation. Twenty-three people were injured. Several minor clashes also occurred in other parts of the city. The official announced the number of casualties for the two days as follows: Yesterday, 11 civilians died and 49 were injured, 22 police officers were injured, and 69 police officers were injured. Today, 27 civilians were injured. The number of police deaths and injuries is not yet known. In Lucknow, university students ignored the authorities' ban and jointly went on strike to hold demonstrations in the streets. The police attempted to disperse them, and they threw stones at the police like rain. The authorities immediately ordered the opening of fire. The number of casualties afterwards is unknown, only that 13 students were arrested. The situation in New Delhi is also very serious. The crowd stormed through the barbed wire placed on a certain hillside (the Governor-General's residence is located there) and were repelled by the police. Another group of rioters prepared to storm near the Governor-General's residence, but were also blocked by the police. In Karachi, all city markets have been closed. Students at most schools have gone on strike. Singh, the chairman of the Bihar Congress Party branch, has been arrested. Various organizations of the Congress Party in Mysore have been declared illegal. In Pune (where Gandhi is detained), a clash occurred between the police and the people, resulting in 14 injuries, all of whom have been sent to the hospital. Various Congress Party agencies in Madras Province have also been declared illegal. Governor Sir Hope of the province, who was on vacation in Ootacamund, flew back to his post today. All demonstrations, mass gatherings, and various political activities are prohibited. Many Congress Party leaders have been arrested.

Saigon, 11th (Haitong News Agency): According to news from Mumbai, in the second disobedience movement in India, disturbances, strikes, and boycotts have occurred everywhere. Universities in major cities have also gone on strike. Currently, the British suppression of the Indian independence movement is even more severe than the measures taken by the British police during the previous civil disobedience movement. Police use tear gas, bombs, and pistols on defenseless people in the streets. In Benares, a group of young students were repeatedly attacked by the police. The demonstrators were dispersed by gunfire, and nearly 30 students were killed or injured. Clashes continued in Pune, where Gandhi and other Congress Party leaders are detained. All entrances to the city are tightly guarded by the police. There are boycott movements in Kolkata, Mumbai, Benares, Agra, Lahore, Hyderabad, and small cities in various provinces. Strikes have occurred in Kolkata and Mumbai, but due to British press censorship, details of the expansion of the strikes are unknown.

### British Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Indian Issue; House of Commons Does Not Intend to Convene Meeting

Berlin, 10th (Allied News Agency): According to a dispatch from the Swedish capital, the British Cabinet held an emergency meeting on the morning of the 10th to discuss the Indian issue, which lasted for quite a long time. At that time, the Secretary of State for India, Amery, first explained in detail, based on a report from the Government of India, the process of adopting the resolution of the All-India Congress Committee demanding the withdrawal of British forces, and the situation of disturbances caused by the suppression of the Congress Party, and the situation of the unfolding of the non-cooperation movement. Each member of the Cabinet seemed to have raised questions about this, and the content of the discussion is not yet fully understood. However, judging from the opinions of various London newspapers, there were many differences of opinion in this Cabinet meeting, but apart from being unable to but recognize the tough policy of the Government of India, there seemed to be no results. However, there was strong opposition to this attitude of the government, especially from the Labour Party. The Labour Party also convened a meeting on the 10th for the Indian issue. According to news from the German News Agency, the Labour Party issued a statement after the meeting, greatly criticizing the neglect of the measures taken by the Government of India. The party also demanded that the government immediately convene Parliament to explain the policy of the Government of India. The party's organ, "Report News," also commented on the Indian issue, stating that the result of the government using force to prevent instability has instead accelerated the development of this situation, so the state of unrest in India will be increasingly deepened in the future.

Swedish Capital, 11th (Haitong News Agency): News was received from London late last night that the British House of Commons does not intend to convene a meeting to discuss the situation in India. The Independent Labour Party had proposed convening Parliament, but political circles in London believe that the government is unlikely to accept this proposal.

Swedish Capital, 11th (Allied News Agency): A London message received here today revealed that the Cabinet held an emergency meeting this morning, which lasted for quite a long time, to consider the latest developments. This message is sufficient to reflect the seriousness of the Indian crisis encountered by the Churchill government. During the British Cabinet meeting, Secretary of State for India Amery explained the general situation, followed by a heated debate, but the details have not been disclosed. At the same time, Independent Party leader Maxton demanded that Parliament be reopened to discuss the Indian situation.

### Bose Delivers Broadcast Speech in Germany

Berlin, 10th (Havas News Agency): Indian pro-Axis nationalist leader Bose delivered a broadcast speech here today to the Indian people, urging all men, women, and children in the country to unite and participate in the anti-British imperialism struggle, stating, "Our leaders Gandhi, Nehru, and other key figures have been arrested for the crime of demanding freedom for India. This kind of measure is not surprising, because many of us have been imprisoned for many years for committing the same crime. Although the British flaunt the banner of 'fighting for freedom and democracy,' it is the British who ordered the arrests, so in fact, the British are only fighting for their imperialist interests. At this time, all countries in the world are expressing sympathy for us, and it is time for us to make the final struggle for our freedom. In this large-scale struggle, all Indians, regardless of men, women, old, or young, must unite as one. We should not stop fighting until we drive the British out of the country and the flag of freedom flies all over the country."

### Summer Epidemic Prevention: Seasonal Epidemics Often Occur Due to Dietary Carelessness; Strengthening the Stomach and Intestines Can Reduce the Risk of Infection

Those annoying flies fill the world, and because of their coming and going, they hide the crisis of human life everywhere. The most important intestinal diseases include: dysentery, typhoid fever, etc. With just a little carelessness, they can strip away one's life. Therefore, the reason for the transmission of these diseases is mostly due to dietary carelessness, bringing these kinds of things, such as dysentery bacteria and typhoid bacteria, into the intestines, giving them the opportunity to breed rampant in the human body. Their symptoms are briefly written below! "Cholera, commonly known as tiger cholera, is one of the most terrible epidemics that can end a person's life in a very short period of time! Mild cases are just a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea, a headache or dizziness, slight fatigue, and cold limbs, and can be cured in about a week. Severe cases are often fatal, with severe vomiting and diarrhea, sunken eye sockets, sunken fingertips, pale face, thirst, low and hoarse voice, cramps, etc. However, people with weak bodies are more likely to get this disease. If they take the strengthening and blood-tonifying 'Ruosu,' their physique will become strong, their resistance to bacteria will be strong, and they will never suffer from this disease.

"Typhoid fever" usually lasts about four weeks. In the first week, appetite is poor, and there is fatigue and fever. In the second week, the fever increases, around 39 and 40 degrees Celsius, with impaired consciousness, delirium, dry tongue coating, dark and thick, while the tip of the tongue is prickly and detached. This week is the most dangerous. If attention is not paid in the third week, such as ulcers in the intestines, even bleeding, perforation, and the temperature will drop, and death is inevitable; but if the third week is survived without these phenomena, then the body temperature will return to normal after the fourth week, and all symptoms will disappear, and recovery will gradually occur.

"Dysentery" is commonly divided into red and white types, but red dysentery is more severe, and is also commonly known as dysentery. Mild cases are similar to colitis, with abdominal pain, a feeling of urgency and tenesmus during excretion, and mucus in the stool, but severe cases will develop ulcers in the intestines, with pus and blood in the stool, fatigue, weakness, listlessness, increased frequency of excretion, and often death.

In summary, these three diseases are caused by momentary carelessness, resulting in great suffering, even death. How can we not be vigilant? Therefore, the ancients said, "Disease enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of the mouth." This is indeed not wrong. However, dietary prudence cannot be so accurately guaranteed. Now, there is a savior, which is more reliable and convenient than getting vaccinations, and that is the most famous "Ruosu." It is the most reliable and safest preventive medicine. If you do not want to suffer from the pain of disease, then quickly take this great Ruosu. "Ruosu" contains vitamin B, powerful digestive enzymes, hormones, etc., so it has special effects.

### Roosevelt's Letter to Stalin: Not Yet Delivered by the U.S. Representative; General Bratton First Receives Reporters, Saying He Has Already Met with Soviet Authorities Four Times

Moscow, Eleventh Day, Allied News Agency: After U.S. President Roosevelt's representative, General Bratton, arrived here, he received reporters from various countries for the first time yesterday. According to him, President Roosevelt's letter to Stalin has not yet been submitted. The purpose of his visit is purely military in nature, mainly to discuss the acceleration of the supply of U.S. military supplies to the Soviet Union, and has absolutely nothing to do with opening a second battlefield. He has already discussed with the Soviet military authorities in the Defense Committee Office four times, and no representatives from other countries participated.

Berlin, Eleventh Day, Hai Tong News Agency: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman declared last night that Churchill seems to have rushed to Moscow, as Churchill must go abroad whenever the Allied powers encounter new disasters.

### U.S. Ordnance Production Lags Behind; House Defense Committee Releases Report

Washington, Tenth Day, Havas News Agency: The House Defense Committee released a report today stating that the quantity of U.S. ordnance production is lagging behind the planned schedule. The figures released by the Ordnance Production Bureau regarding U.S. armament and ordnance production do not match the facts. According to the actual situation, the production of certain types of ordnance is far from the plans repeatedly announced to the press by President Roosevelt. The figures and statements repeatedly released by the Ordnance Production Bureau are based on the production figures before the Japanese aircraft bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the gravity of the current situation has not been accurately explained. It is not known that before December 1941, the actual production volume was far below the production capacity. At that time, it was not even thought of completing this great task. In short, the policy adopted by the government for allocating manpower seems extremely clumsy, causing workers to feel as if they are facing conscription or partial mobilization. In fact, mandatory measures are only implemented when it is necessary to transfer workers from a certain industry to more important jobs, and not all of them must be forced.

### A Historical Account of the Caucasus (1)

In this Soviet-German war, the Caucasus, which Germany is determined to obtain, is rich in natural resources, including manganese, coal, copper, and timber. Of particular importance is its possession of the Baku-centered Azerbaijan oil fields. Today, mentioning the history of Russia's initial control over the Caucasus holds a special significance. From this, we can understand the long historical connection between Russia and Georgia, located in the Caucasus. The most prominent example of this connection is that the entire Russian nation is currently under the leadership of Stalin, who was born in Georgia.

The Georgians are one of the many races residing in the Caucasus. It is believed that they began settling in the mountains of the northern Caucasus and the plains of southern Armenia as early as the first century BC. Centuries before Russia rose to its current position as a powerful nation, the Georgians had already established a superior culture, and the arts and literature were nearly at their peak. The medieval kingdom of Queen Tamar was renowned far and wide, and her court poet, Shota Rustaveli, can be regarded as one of the world's greatest poets. However, Georgia's culture was like a flower that bloomed and withered quickly. Generally speaking, the history of this place is filled with a continuous history of war permeated with the scent of gunpowder.

This can be attributed to two factors: one is the geographical obstacle. The existence of vast mountains and forests caused Georgia to split into countless small states whenever a wise and capable ruler passed away. The second factor is the early conversion of the Georgians to Christianity. This placed them in a long-term predicament of being constantly threatened by powerful Islamic nations. Therefore, when Russia was strong enough to extend its power to the Transcaucasus, they appeared as saviors of Georgia, which was suffering under the oppression of Turkey and Persia.

Russia and the people of the Caucasus began contact long before that time; there were exchanges as early as the tenth century. However, the real initial contact can be traced back to the late sixteenth century when the Cossacks invaded the area around the mouth of the Terek River. Since then, Cossacks have been flowing in continuously, and the famous "Cossack Line" has gradually been established. In the future, this will serve as Russia's outpost defense line against aggression from the south and southeast, playing a significant role. The "Cossack Line" was gradually strengthened as fortresses were built along the Terek River. This project was completed in 1832, but it had already performed many meritorious deeds before that.

For centuries, Christian Georgia, unable to bear the oppression of Islamic nations, had been appealing to Russia for help. However, it was not until the mid-eighteenth century that Russia reached a powerful position sufficient to take practical action. The first military intervention occurred in 1769. Russia sent General Totleben through the Daryal Gorge, across the northern Caucasus Mountains, and into Tiflis, the capital of Georgia, defeating the Turkish army in Imereti.

However, besides indicating that Russia still had the possibility of action, this did not have a lasting effect. The second event was of greater importance, as it led to the construction of the famous Georgian Military Road. In the century that followed, it formed the only major artery for transportation between Russia and the Transcaucasus. King Heraclius II of Georgia requested Empress Catherine of Russia to help resist the increasingly greedy demands of Turkey. Russia quickly dispatched General Potemkin, who transformed the rugged and uneven mountain paths into a military road that could quickly mobilize troops. At the northern end, he built the fortress of Vladikavkaz to defend the starting point of the military road. By October 1783, he was able to drive his troops into Tiflis without any worries.

Potemkin also made other significant contributions. He was not only the first meritorious official to introduce Russian colonists from the interior to the Transcaucasus, but also the initiator of introducing German colonists to Tiflis. When he returned, he also made every effort to accommodate Armenian refugees who were fleeing from Turkish oppression, in order to use their business acumen to develop Russia's foreign trade.

After Potemkin's expedition to Tiflis, diplomatic difficulties and military setbacks followed. It was not until 1799 that the abandoned and destroyed Vladikavkaz was rebuilt, and not until the following year that Georgia was officially merged with Russia. Since 1802, when an outstanding talent named Tsitsianov was appointed as the commander of the Caucasus, this connection has become even stronger.

Although of Georgian descent, he grew up in Russia. During his four years in office until his death in the Battle of Baku, Tsitsianov showed that he possessed the same talent for education and culture as he did for military affairs and diplomacy. However, many difficulties stood before him. The union of Georgia and Russia inevitably meant a prolonged state of hostility with Persia and Turkey. This also made it impossible to fully subdue the mountain-dwelling races, because they mostly believed in Islam, and once Russia had a direct and sudden conflict with its new neighbors, they would naturally be likely to help the enemy attack. Thus began the long-term campaign against the mountain tribes, which consumed Russian military power for half a century, and also mobilized countless famous generals and officers.

### Wang Jinxiu Jewelry Store Murder Case: Details of the Criminals' Confessions; the Arrested Major Criminal Tang Wenxiang Died in Custody from Illness; Police Department Charges with Murder and Robbery

Wang Weiyuan, the owner of the Wang Jinxiu Jewelry Store at 521 Xiahui Road, whose daughter, Qu Huide, was living with him, was attacked and injured by Jin Fugen, a native of Pudong and owner of the Changxing Flower Shop at 519 next door, and his accomplices on the night of June 26. Wang's adopted son, Wang Mian, was killed, and 300 yuan in cash was robbed.

Four People Arrested

After the incident, the French police arrested the criminals Jin Fugen, Wang Ruigen, Tang Wenxiang, and Wang Yangshi (Wang Weiyuan's concubine mother), and the shop assistant Gao Shouting. The details have been reported in the newspapers. However, Tang Wenxiang, a major criminal in the case, died in custody from illness. The police department has now transferred Jin and the other criminals to the court. The police department charged Jin Fugen, Wang Ruigen, and others with murder and robbery. Tang Wenxiang, having died from illness, was not prosecuted.

Jin Fugen's Confession

Under interrogation, Jin Fugen confessed that he runs a flower shop. Last month, Tang Wenxiang, a former partner of the plaintiff, met with him in the French Park. He said that the plaintiff's mother, Wang Yangshi, and he had opened the Warner Jewelry Store on Xiahui Road, but the police had unreasonably ordered it to close, mistaking that Wang Weiyuan had instigated it. Therefore, he was angry at the plaintiff and instructed him to find a way to murder Wang Weiyuan. They agreed to borrow two bamboo ladders to connect and place them against the window of the plaintiff's attic room on that night. He then gathered three apprentices from his shop, including Wang Ruigen, and entered the room together. Wang Weiyuan was away in Suzhou. There was only a daughter and a boy in the room. The girl screamed, so he threw a wooden stool at her but missed. Tang Wenxiang then used a stool to knock the girl down on the bed, leaving her dying. Tang then hacked the boy to death. They opened the box and robbed 300 yuan in cash before fleeing.

Two Criminals Detained

Wang Ruigen, 17 years old, confessed that he had been an apprentice at the Changxing Flower Shop for only four months. Jin Fugen asked me to go with him to help with the crime. When I went upstairs, I saw that Jin and the others had already injured a boy and a girl. I went downstairs. I don't know anything else. Wang Yangshi confessed that she lives at 21 Luban Road. Although she learned about the Jinxiu Jewelry Store murder case afterward, she was not involved in the conspiracy. Gao Shouting confessed that he has been working at the plaintiff's shop and knows nothing about the murder case. The court ordered Wang Yangshi and Gao Shouting to be released on bail. Jin Fugen and Wang Ruigen were detained for further interrogation.

### Liang Renzheng Arrives in Shanghai After Trip: Talks about the Current Situation in North China

(Tong Meng News Agency) Liang Renzheng, the Director of the Shimen Education Bureau, arrived in Shanghai after traveling in Central China this time. He gave a broadcast speech at the Shanghai Radio Station at 9:15 PM on the 11th, titled "Telling the Compatriots of the Whole Country the Actual Situation of North China". The following is a summary of his speech.

Dear compatriots of the whole country, in order to understand the actual situation of China, I came to travel here from North China. Today, taking this broadcasting opportunity to talk with you, my dear compatriots, is truly enjoyable. The actual situation of North China in the five years since the Incident may also be something you are happy to hear about.

After the Lugou Bridge Incident, the entire North China fell into chaos. People were displaced, bandits rose up, and the countryside almost came to a standstill. As a result, cities such as Beijing and Tianjin also experienced the tragedy of food panic. Later, in the 29th year of the Republic of China, the North China Political Affairs Commission was established. Since the establishment of this organization, the political, security, financial, construction, and educational affairs of North China have developed rapidly. First, in terms of politics, each province organized a training center for county administration personnel. Incumbent county magistrates and the secretaries and section chiefs of various county governments were trained together. Without undergoing this training, one could not be appointed as a county magistrate. As a result of this selection, about 80-90% of incompetent and opportunistic county magistrates have been eliminated. Therefore, county administration has progressed rapidly. The Baojia system was completed long ago, and recently, the compilation of large townships has begun, which is expected to be completed this year. Once the large township system is compiled, each township will have a budget for income and expenditure. At that time, corrupt officials and inferior village chiefs will have no way to use their tricks. In North China, the counties that have already compiled the large townships in Hebei Province account for about 80%.

Speaking of the security situation in North China, the security strengthening campaign has been held since last year and ended on June 15th of this year, divided into four times. The fourth security strengthening campaign was promoted after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, so its movement was divided into three major goals. The first goal was to awaken the masses, so that the masses have the awareness of excluding Britain and the United States and building East Asia in their minds, called "East Asia Liberation". The second goal was "Suppressing Communists and Self-Defense" The third goal was "Diligence, Thrift, and Increased Production." During this period, self-defense groups in various parts of North China intensified training. The biggest gain during the fourth security strengthening period was the well-drilling work in diligence, thrift, and increased production. Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces held it simultaneously. The total number of wells drilled was 500,000, about 1,000 wells per county. For each well, the North China Political Affairs Commission provided an interest-free loan of 50 yuan and subsidized two tons of coal for brick burning. This well-drilling work has now been successful, and the drought problem in North China for thousands of years has been partially solved during these four security strengthening periods, as a result of the four security strengthening campaigns, the people's hearts are greatly at ease.

At the same time, the North China Political Affairs Commission Security General Office also started building the army, and those who were compiled were stationed in various parts of North China. Every soldier is a good family child with a constant property and a little knowledge. They are youths selected by the village chiefs from each county and village, and they must pass an exam before being allowed to enlist and receive training. The police power in North China is also affiliated to the Security General Office, which has a police affairs office, headed by Wang Zhulin, who actively strengthens police administration, such as the training of police officers and police officers in each county. The police chiefs must carefully select their talents and examine their qualifications. Each province also has a training institute for police chiefs, so the quality of police personnel in each county is gradually improving. For the compilation of Baojia, the training of self-defense groups, the control of the economy, and the distribution of supplies, they can all happily handle the current important policies.

Next, let's talk about the actual economic situation in North China. Due to the success of the United Reserve Bank's issuance of silver notes, there were many difficulties when the United Reserve Bank's policy was promoted. However, because those in charge buried their heads in hard work, after the old legal currency disappeared in North China, the Political Affairs Commission forcibly controlled financial institutions, such as banning illegal silver houses and money shops, so the silver houses and money shops in North China automatically changed their business or gathered shares to apply for opening silver houses and banks according to law. In short, after such strict control, the floating capital of North China has been brought into line. Speculative business has long been completely eliminated. Recently, all businesses have been organized into a cooperative system, and all commodities have been completely implemented with a rationing system and a marked price system. If one illegally obtains exorbitant profits, one can be immediately subject to the investigation and sanctions of the economic police officers. Therefore, the price suppression is quite effective.

Next, let's talk briefly about the construction and education of North China. The construction of North China in the five years since the Incident is truly amazing. Specifically, first, the Shide Railway has been completed. This is the railway line from Shimen City (formerly known as Shijiazhuang) in the southern part of Hebei Province to Dezhou, an important place in Shandong Province. This line runs across the Beijing-Hankou and Tianjin-Pukou lines.

At the same time, the Shitai Line (also known as the Zhengtai Line) was converted into a wide gauge, so the rich resources of Shanxi can be directly transported to the Shide Line. Important products such as cotton, wheat, and peanuts from the southern part of Hebei can be easily transported. Passenger cars have also been opened early. For example, if we go to Shimen from Shanghai or Qingdao, or go to Taiyuan, we can change to the Shide Line from Dezhou on the Tianjin-Pukou Line without having to detour through Tianjin and Beijing.

Other construction works, such as the opening of the Fujiang River, the Yongding River, and the tributaries, and the new construction of the Shijin Canal (from Shitou to Tianjin), not only benefit transportation, but also prevent floods. Another example is the construction of new cities, the major reform of the Beijing East and West Railway Stations, and the active construction of small cities in Xuzhou, Taiyuan, Shitou, Handan, and Baoding, such as the opening of streets, the completion of sewers, and public bus transportation in various counties. All the important projects in North China that we can imagine are progressing steadily. Taking the Cangshi Railway and the Shijin Canal as examples, important people in our country had proposed to build and repair them 20 years ago, and they had been brewing several times, but they had not been realized. Now they have succeeded in the midst of military chaos. We can't help but feel emotional about this.

The education of North China has indeed progressed a lot compared to the time of the Incident. However, compared to before the Incident, both the quality and quantity are still inferior. In terms of quantity, it is limited by security and economic problems. In terms of quality, it is due to the lack of intellectuals. However, in the past year, as the security situation in various places has gradually turned around, the quantitative aspect has suddenly become more prosperous. At the time of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all the British and American missionary schools in North China were taken over by the state and have all resumed classes. In this hot summer, I wish all the compatriots in the country good health. Goodbye. (End)

However, some employees did not have time to inject at that time. Therefore, yesterday, we asked the hospital to send Mr. Xu Mian, Mr. Zhu Bingwen, Ms. Wang Shuzhen, and Ms. Wang Jingzhen to the museum for a second injection. All the employees of this museum have now been completely injected. The enthusiastic service spirit of the hospital is admirable. Thank you here.

### Not Lacking Selling at High Prices, Public Bond Gains Failed to Sharply Increase; Jin Chang Suddenly Opened Yesterday

Lingsheng lost two goals in the first half. After changing sides, Lingsheng became even weaker. Aiguo's Ming Jing, Zhong, and Meihua scored twice. Seeing the situation was not good, Lingsheng quickly mobilized reinforcements. Indeed, Chen Ru'an recovered some lost ground. Aiguo's Zhu Chengran was suddenly called for a foul. Chen Ru'an scored on the six-meter penalty kick. With only one minute left in the game, Wang Weizhen scored again, leading to a 5 to 2 victory.

Youlian vs. Huanan - A Rematch on the Field

Youlian's goalkeeper Qin Bigao was absent, replaced by Xi Shiyin. Huanan's Dong Jincai was also absent. Not long after the start of the game, Zhang Xianlun single-handedly stormed the enemy's gate. Huanan's Li Xianzheng carelessly failed to block him, and the first goal was scored. Huanan's Liu Chuji, unwilling to be outdone, cleverly used an "empty fort" strategy and immediately scored a goal back. Before five minutes had passed, Zhai Xilin, with the assistance of Lu Dazhen, scored a goal, ending the first half with a score of 2 to 1. After switching sides, Youlian played cautiously, adopting a square formation to create a stalemate. No goals were scored in the second half, and Youlian narrowly won 2 to 1, earning the right to compete in the finals.

Nanyang vs. Zhonglian

Fan Qingcheng demonstrated his power and Zhang Youzhang added to the lead. The first half ended with a score of 2 to 0. Zhonglian was eager to win, and Ren Yawei launched a comfortable and continuous attack. Ren Jian established his fame on the border. After Li Sen scored a goal for Nanyang, they continued their efforts. Zhang Youzhang made a successful long-range shot, and Han Longhai followed suit. Although Zhonglian had good opportunities, they were all in vain. Nanyang defeated Zhonglian 5 to 2. (Aiguo) Wang Weizhen, Wang Yinlan, Zhu Chengran, Lu Lianshi, Chen Zezhuang, Feng Jin (Youlian) Qu Xilin, Gong Shiyin, Li Zude, Yan Zhi, Zhang Lun, Qu Xilong, Lu Dazhen (Nanyang) Han Longhai, Zhang Lun, Li Qi, Zhang Youzhang, Fan Qingcheng, Wang Yuren, Li Yao"

### Autumn Offensive of Various Theatrical Circles

— Bingjiu

"The Shanghai theatrical scene, which had been quiet during the summer, has now passed its period of dormancy. Stirred by this prolonged stillness, various troupes are making preparations for an autumn offensive. They are adjusting their lineups, recruiting new talent, engaging in mutual deception, and showcasing their skills. This is like the calm before a major battle, and the work done during this period is more important and complex than the battle itself. Although the preparations of various theatrical troupes are not yet in the final stage, most are already well underway. This information is being disseminated, but theatrical news can change rapidly, and the final decisions remain to be seen.

Golden

Golden's autumn lineup is mostly finalized. The core members, such as Furongcao, Xiao Sanmazi, and Gao Xueqiao, will remain. As for the supporting roles, they have hired Guo Suqiu, Li Shengzao, Yuan Shihai, Jiang Shiyu, and Ai Shiju. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the end of this month, with the opening date set for around September 10th.

Renewal

Song Dezhu's troupe was originally scheduled to perform for one month, but if the performances are well-received, the engagement may be extended for another month or two. The cast for the next period is still being sought, with Zheng Bingru or Liang Xiaoluan being the targets.

Tianchan

The owner of Tianchan is determined to innovate this autumn, sparing no expense to hire supporting actors to compete with Golden and Renewal. The recruiting staff has already gone to Beijing, and the leading actor is expected to be Jin Shaoshan or Li Wanchun. There are also rumors of inviting Mei Lanfang to perform, as Mei had a previous agreement with the owner of Tianchan a few years ago. (Some say Yu Sulian and Gao Baisui have been hired, but it is unclear which is correct.)

Gongwutai

They will continue to perform original plays, with no changes to the cast.

Great Stage

Last year, the Great Stage invited Tan Fuying to Shanghai, which proved to be profitable. This year, they plan to invite him again for a month-long engagement. However, the exchange rate between Beijing and Shanghai has increased significantly in recent years, so the issue of payment still needs to be negotiated.

Empress

The Empress is ambitiously switching to Peking Opera, with a grand vision. In addition to sending staff to Beijing to invite Shang Xiaoyun and Zhou Xiaotian, they have also hired Zhao Songqiao, Cheng Yupu, Liu Yunfang, Ge Cijiang, Zhang Yueting, and others, forming a strong and well-organized team. (Rumor has it that Cheng Shaoyu, Liu Binkun, and Wang Lanfang have been hired, but since Cheng and others are core members of Golden, this is unlikely to be true.)

Great Shanghai

Rumors of the Great Shanghai switching to Peking Opera are rampant. The hosts, Zhang Shankun and Feng Gengguang, are focusing on Mei Lanfang alone. If Mei is willing to perform, then restructuring into a Peking Opera theater will not be a problem. Otherwise, it may just be a pipe dream.

In addition, the Central Grand Theater, which has been showing domestic films, is also considering switching to Peking Opera and is currently in preparation. There are rumors of hiring Zhou Xinfang to perform, but the cast has not yet been determined. In short, this year, due to the film shortage, Peking Opera theaters have been given a chance to make a comeback. However, the cost of hiring leading actors is high, and other expenses are no longer what they used to be. Coupled with the sluggish market and the people's insecure livelihoods, although the theaters are racking their brains and competing fiercely, the results may not be as satisfactory as they hope.

### The Truth Behind Chen Yanyan and Huang Shaofen's Marital Crisis

— Yin

"The film industry has recently been buzzing with news of a marital crisis. Fans are very concerned about this case. I have uncovered the truth and am reporting it to the readers.

The main characters in this marital crisis are the famous actress Chen Yanyan, known as 'Little Crow,' and her husband, the cinematographer Huang Shaofen. Their union began with friendship and blossomed into love. They married in September of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). Due to their love, they lived a sweet life. Soon after, they celebrated the birth of their daughter, nicknamed 'Baobao,' who is now five years old. Unfortunately, the moon waxes and wanes, and beautiful flowers wither easily. Starting last year, the feelings between the two gradually cooled, and they seemed to be heading in the same direction as Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua. However, the issue of 'Baobao's' upbringing has stalled the matter. The agreed-upon solution is that Chen Yanyan will raise 'Baobao' until she is ten years old, and Huang Shaofen will educate her after she turns ten. This Baobao has been raised by Yanyan's mother since she was a child. She felt heartbroken at the thought of her beloved granddaughter being taken away by Huang Shaofen when she turned ten. Therefore, the divorce proposal was temporarily suspended, and they agreed to separate. After the news spread, many speculations arose, and people added fuel to the fire by pairing the couple with other potential partners. A very simple matter was amplified, creating a tense and complicated situation. The person paired with Chen Yanyan was a married man, and his wife was a close friend of Yanyan. Anyone who understands reason and law would know that these two could never be together, but this has stirred up many ruthless storms. Recently, after lawyer Yuan Yang'an was appointed as Chen Yanyan's legal advisor, as announced in this newspaper and other daily newspapers, it aroused further speculation. To understand the truth, I made many inquiries and learned that Chen Yanyan had indeed proposed a divorce from Huang Shaofen before. However, recent developments have become so bizarre and absurd that the matter has been temporarily suspended. She is now staying at home and avoiding contact with the outside world to avoid further rumors. As for the motive for hiring a legal advisor, it is because there are many rumors circulating, so she needs legal protection. Simply put, Chen Yanyan is living her summer life quietly, without any tension. The rumors are mostly due to the atmosphere.

### A Record of Summer Entertainment with Qingge

— Su Shaoqing

Ge Wensheng

"Mr. Ge is a famous amateur Peking Opera singer from Beijing. Ten years ago, he studied at the National Opera Training Institute founded by Mei Lanfang, Yu Shuyan, and others, specializing in the Yu school of laosheng (old male) roles. He excels in 'kao ba' (military) and 'zuo gong' (acting) plays. Among the amateur singers in Beijing today, he is the most diligent and progressive. His position is similar to that of Sun Junqing in Shanghai. He came to Shanghai on business and performed a full rendition of 'Qionglin Banquet' at the Golden Theater to raise funds for a charity organization. I went to watch it. From the opening scene of 'Wen Qiao' asking for directions to the closing, his movements, steps, hair flicks, and water sleeves were all precise. It was a pity that his voice was a bit low due to illness. Mr. Ge is quite tall. If he were to perform 'kao ba' plays, it would be even more spectacular. That day, even though Mr. Ge was in the audience, he could not refuse to sing due to his illness and weak voice. As a result, he sang two excerpts from 'The Basin Case,' 'Sighing at Life' and 'What a Good One,' purely in the Yu style, with many small tunes. Mr. Ge asked me about his singing technique. I said, 'You have captured eight or nine tenths of Yu's subtlety, which is commendable. However, given your large physique and ample lung capacity, you should further refine your vigorousness. Combine strength and softness to reach the highest level. Yu's use of softness is a last resort. Softness is the way of the earth, the virtue of water. If you combine it with the yang (male) energy of fire, it will be perfect.' Since Yu Shuyan, Jukui, Yunliang, and Chengdong, all performers and amateur singers under the age of forty have been emphasizing softness. I know this opinion is not in line with the times, but to correct the current trend, my advice should be adopted, not just for Mr. Ge alone. The word 'strength' is like getting a vaccination during a severe epidemic.'

After Mr. Ge sang, the other guests in the audience also sang one after another. There was one damao (female role), one xiaosheng (young male role), one qingyi (virtuous female role), and the rest were laosheng (old male roles), so I won't go into detail. Finally, the task fell on me. I originally didn't dare to sing the finale, but everyone repeatedly urged me to sing since I was the only one left. Mr. Chen and Mr. Ge were especially insistent, as they wanted to hear me sing just as much as I wanted to hear them. The host, Mr. Jiang Si, asked me to sing the four lines of 'Sighing at the Misfortune of My Brothers' from 'Sangyuan Jizi,' a slow-tempo erhuang. Lao Tan (Tan Xinpei) was a master of this, and Xiao Pei (Pei Yanling) was also very proud of these four lines. He would sing them whenever he met a friend at a banquet. Although I cannot surpass the heroic figures, I am content to be on par with Xiao Pei.

### Two New Films to Be Released Soon

"Hate to Meet Before Marriage", starring Shu Mei-yun and Gao Zhanfei, is scheduled to be released on the 20th of this month at the Da Guangming Theater. This film is filled with twists and turns, and is expected to appeal to the tastes of most audiences, and is a masterpiece directed by Wang Yin in his life. It is now reported that "Under the Peony Flower", directed by Bu Wancang and starring Chen Yunshang, is also scheduled to be released on the 27th of this month at the Dahua Theater. These two films are excellent films specially selected by the Zhonglian Film Company, so they are scheduled to be shown at Western film theaters to show their importance.

### After Listening to Zhu Xiaoqiu's "Fa Men Temple"

— Guo Yi

"Last Friday (the 7th), Zhu Xiaoqiu performed 'Fa Men Temple' as a charity performance at the Golden Theater. I went with Mr. Jin Shaogang to listen. Since Xiaoqiu returned to Shanghai from Hankou, I have met him several times and heard him practice his voice. His singing voice is round and mellow, and his singing style is accurate. I have always praised his talent and beauty. In this era when Peking Opera standards are declining, when the younger generation is competing to learn seductive and charming styles to cater to the times, it is rare to find someone so unyielding and purely following the correct path. It is like hearing the sound of an empty valley, which makes people happy. This is the first time I have seen him on stage with makeup, and his performance is even better than I expected. I must say a few words to help promote him, so that in the future, if Xiaoqiu has the opportunity to perform in Shanghai, the audience can have a general understanding of him based on my comments.

Xiaoqiu comes from a prominent family in southern Hunan. He is fond of Peking Opera and has played it as an amateur in Hankou, where he is very famous. At the same time, his peers rarely dare to challenge him. He then traveled to the old capital and sought advice from senior actors, refining and immersing himself in it day by day and month by month. As a result, his skills became more profound, and he decided to become a professional actor. The famous amateur singer from Hubei Province who became successful before Xiaoqiu was Nan Tiesheng. Now Xiaoqiu is following in his footsteps and is enough to compete with him. Xiaoqiu possesses everything that Tiesheng has, and Xiaoqiu has the unique advantage of a clear and bright voice, which Tiesheng cannot match. His solid rhythm and timing are even better than Tiesheng's. Comparing them in every aspect, Xiaoqiu is not just surpassing him. Taking the 'Fa Men Temple' this evening as an example, I felt that his singing style strictly adheres to the rules, like Huang Guiqiu. However, in terms of his high-pitched and vigorous parts, Guiqiu is less calm and composed. Xiaoqiu maintains a simple and unadorned style, while still retaining the demeanor of a qingyi. Xiaoqiu came to my residence the next day, courteous and humble, hoping that I would point out his shortcomings. This shows Xiaoqiu's willingness to learn from others and his sincerity in asking about what he doesn't know. However, how can I benefit Xiaoqiu? I only know that Xiaoqiu is humble and ambitious, and I believe that he is just starting his career and will not stop. Xiaoqiu's rise in the empty valley is like choosing the most talented person in difficult circumstances, and he is striving to improve himself. Encouraging him and setting expectations is what I hope for from those who share my values. Although I am not talented, I do not easily praise others unless they truly deserve it.

### A Tour of Shanghai's Book Market

— Jianfan

"In recent years, Shanghai's book market has been booming again. Listening to storytelling is an affordable form of entertainment. Among all the recreational activities, it is the cheapest. Moreover, it is enjoyed by both the refined and the common. As long as you sit patiently and quietly, everyone can listen with great interest! Storytellers travel around, engaging in their art and delving into the lives of ordinary people. They have the responsibility of promoting popular culture and play a noble role in the entertainment industry. Their subtle influence should not be ignored. Recently, several new book markets have opened in the Shanghai concessions, bringing the total number to at least sixteen or seventeen, together with the existing ones. Famous storytellers are in high demand and are fully booked. I have a passion for listening to storytelling and have made a grand aspiration to visit various venues and record what I see and hear for fellow enthusiasts.

Huangfu Book Market

The Huangfu Book Market opened on August 1st. It is located in the alley next to the theater on Zhejiang Road in the central district, on the original site of the Huangfu Hotel's ballroom. It has been renovated to look brand new and luxurious! The curtains and table covers on the stage are all yellow, giving it a regal atmosphere. The newly made canvas chairs can accommodate about two hundred listeners. The equipment and layout are quite good.

The storytelling lineup at the Huangfu is very strong. The daytime, afternoon, and evening sessions all feature top performers! Especially the daytime sessions, which are full of talent and guaranteed to satisfy listeners.

### Sailing in the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jiaji

VIII. What to Do About It?

"The Ye family of Shidetang, from Madam Ye Er to Magpie and others, were all hoping for Weicheng's return, from morning to night. When he returned after dusk, Madam Ye Er greatly regretted not sending He Zixing to Shuangqiao Town after lunch. When he returned late at night, Madam Ye Er again regretted not sending He Zixing to Bianqiao Town when it was getting dark. But Cuizhen and He Ma kept comforting Madam Ye Er, saying that the snow had stopped, the wind had died down, and that with Axing accompanying him, it would be easy to carry the young master back on his back. Madam Ye Er took Weicheng's message and repeatedly read it under the lamp, saying, 'Weicheng said that I will know in a few days why he went to Yaoqiao. Why can I only know in a few days, and why can't I know now?' She muttered to herself, but didn't allow He Ma, Magpie, or others to whisper to each other. Her thought was that if Weicheng were to call at the door, their voices would disturb him, and she wouldn't be able to hear him. She listened to the chiming clock ring twelve times, and asked Magpie to help her go outside the gate to see if Weicheng was coming back. In the past, Madam Ye Er was more astute than Madam Ye Da among the wives of Shidetang. But tonight, because she was so worried about Weicheng's safety outside, her emotions suddenly overwhelmed her reason. Although Cuizhen explained, 'It's pitch black outside the gate, you can't see anything.' She said, 'The ground is covered with snow, how can you not see anything?' Cuizhen said, 'If he doesn't come back late at night, it must be that Master Chen and Miss Chen have kept him. It's pointless to go outside the gate.' She said, 'Even if Weicheng is kept by them, Axing can come back. Seeing Axing is like seeing my son come back.' Seeing that her persuasion was ineffective, Cuizhen immediately asked He Ma to light a lantern and send Madam Ye Er outside the gate. He Ma held the lantern in front, with Magpie on the left and Cuizhen on the right, holding Madam Ye Er as she walked outside. The farmhand Xu Quanfu opened the main gate and the bamboo gate and waited. Outside the gate was a sheet of white, and in the distance was a patch of black. There was no sign of Weicheng or Axing, not even a single passing stranger. A gust of wind almost blew out the candle inside the lantern. This forced Madam Ye Er to return disappointed." (152)
