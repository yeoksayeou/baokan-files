### Cripps Leaves India for England; Will Report on the Situation to the Lower House; Churchill Will Also Explain His Position

London, 13th (Reuters) – Prime Minister Churchill briefly mentioned the failure of Cripps' mission to India in the Lower House today. After the question period ended, Labor MP Greenwood asked the Prime Minister whether he could publish a white paper on the Indian situation this week to clarify the position, so that the Lower House could debate the Indian issue as soon as possible after Cripps returned to England. The Prime Minister replied, "Regarding the Indian negotiations and the mission of the Lord Privy Seal (Cripps), it is better to wait until the Lord Privy Seal returns home, as the Lord Privy Seal can report his important mission to the Lower House in person. As for the question of whether a white paper can be published, I will consider it."

Stockholm, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – British Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps is on his way back to England, and his party arrived in Karachi yesterday afternoon.

Saigon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – A dispatch from New Delhi states that Sir Stafford Cripps flew from Karachi to Cairo, preparing to return to London from there.

Karachi, 13th (Reuters) – Before leaving Karachi for London today, Sir Stafford Cripps hosted journalists. Although he looked tired and worried, he patiently answered all questions from journalists in a humorous tone. It is said that "I have not lost hope that the people of India will one day reach a compromise. We must achieve a compromise, but I have no idea when this compromise can be achieved, as this depends on the Indians, Indian parties, and Indian leaders. We have put forward the best proposals possible. Discussing the past is of no help. Indian leaders will not lose their representative character if they join the National Government. The Congress Party demands that the National Government not be responsible to the Viceroy, but in the current state of wartime emergency, this cabinet must be subject to some degree of control. Regardless of the form of government, some form of control must be exercised over the cabinet. In the current emergency situation, the Viceroy cannot abandon his authority." He continued, "Colonel Johnson, President Roosevelt's special envoy to India, participated in the negotiations entirely in an unofficial capacity. In fact, it was the Congress Party that first asked Johnson for assistance, and President Roosevelt had nothing to do with this matter. I do not blame anyone for the failure of my mission. I have not abandoned my previous view that complete self-determination is the only way to solve the Indian problem."

Allahabad, 13th (Reuters) – Indian Liberal Party leader Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru told reporters here yesterday that the failure of negotiations in New Delhi, especially the fact that Sir Stafford Cripps' negotiations with all parties had originally hoped to come to an agreement but ultimately fell short, was a source of pain that words cannot express. Although the British proposal has been announced to be withdrawn, I only acknowledge that Sir Stafford Cripps' mission is only "temporary in nature." I hope that Cripps can return to London as soon as possible and convey the views of the Indian side to his wartime cabinet colleagues as much as possible, so that they can understand the necessity of transferring power immediately and their common interests, and then seek a solution.

### India Will Not Hinder British and American War Efforts; Nehru's Remarks in New Delhi

New Delhi, 12th (Reuters) – At a press conference this morning, when Nehru was asked whether the breakdown of the current British-Indian negotiations would change the National Congress' attitude towards the British government, Nehru replied that today's national affairs are too important for anyone to easily comment on them or consider them with a painful attitude. We should not have this feeling towards them, because pain will obscure our consciousness. The basic reason is not how the British government treats India or how we treat Britain, but the crisis that India is facing and how we should deal with this crisis. Therefore, we will not hinder Britain's war efforts in India or hinder our American friends' future war power in India because of past events. We sincerely hope that this kind of action can be carried out at the highest speed, and we also sincerely hope that Indians will continue to do their work and not give up their responsibilities. Our current problem is that although we do not participate in Britain's war efforts, we should not hinder them at the same time. We should organize our own fighting power in accordance with the basic concept that India must be free and independent. I expect the All-India National Congress to consider this issue during its half-month session and instruct us on how to deal with this matter.

New Delhi, 13th (Reuters) – Indian National Party Chairman Acharya Kripalani praised British Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps' visit to India in a statement to the press here yesterday, saying that although the goals we hoped for were not achieved, all discussions were conducted in a friendly environment. Although our opinions differ greatly from those of Minister Cripps, we parted as close friends, which is very gratifying. Furthermore, the negotiations were earnest throughout. The external rumor that the Standing Committee of the National Party repeatedly made decisions influenced by Gandhi's views is not true. In fact, Gandhi had clearly announced that the Standing Committee could freely decide on countermeasures after consulting the merits and demerits of the British proposal.

### British Minister of Labour Bevin's Speech: Wishes India Could Establish a Great Unified Nation

London, 13th (Reuters) – Minister of Labor Bevin said in his speech in Roston yesterday that he sincerely hoped that India could become a great unified nation and could avoid civil war to achieve this goal. The British-Indian issue will be resolved again, and it is not far off. He also hoped that all parts of the world could understand that Britain had just tried to solve the Indian problem with the greatest strength. Especially, if we cannot obtain unanimous consent from all parties and factions in India for the heavy responsibilities we bear, we should not rashly transfer them to a certain class. The untouchable class in India is the most pitiful. I would rather be expelled from India than entrust this class to another powerful class without proper guarantees. If India can reunite, it will cooperate hand in hand with Western democracy, and we dare to tell the world that the East and the West will jointly create a great democracy, a brotherhood, regardless of race or class, and only to promote the status of mankind.

### Chongqing Newspapers Comment on British-Indian Negotiations, Hoping to Find a Solution

Chongqing, 13th – Regarding the Indian issue, Chongqing newspapers today commented, unanimously hoping that both sides can continue negotiations as soon as possible. The Central Daily News said that we believe that both the British and Indian sides should seek a method that adapts to the reality of the environment and continue negotiations as soon as possible, for the sake of their own interests, for the sake of the alliance, and for the sake of striving for common freedom, so as not to let success fall short. The Ta Kung Pao said that we hope that the door to British-Indian negotiations will not be closed from now on. The impact of this issue if it is not resolved satisfactorily is too great. Here, China and the United States should offer some advice. The Sao Dang Pao said that we earnestly hope that both sides will value the concerns of allied countries such as China and the United States, reopen the door to negotiations, and quickly find a solution. The Shishi Xinbao speculated on this issue with an optimistic attitude, saying that it may be possible to negotiate successfully in the next few weeks or even days. It also said that looking at the current world situation, the British-Indian issue is just a small contradiction before a big contradiction. The more acute the development of big contradictions, the faster the elimination of small contradictions.

### India's "Rose Garden"

The state of Rajputana in India is located southwest of New Delhi, the capital of India. The scenery, mountains, and rivers are beautiful. Among the cities in India, it is arguably second to none in terms of scenery. Since the construction of the garden by Prince Udai Singh II in 1568, later generations have continued to improve it, making it a major scenic spot. Travelers to India must make it a point to visit it. The palaces and Pichola Lake are the most attractive, and the gardens and villas are like pearls strung together. It is collectively called the "Rose Garden", and the beautiful scenery can be imagined. The famous gardens are in the south of the city; Pichola Lake is in the west of the city.

### Insurance Companies of the Allied Nations Undergoing Liquidation

(Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency in this city) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the insurance companies of various Allied nations in this city have been taken over by the Japanese Army and Navy authorities. It is now learned that the Japanese military authorities announced yesterday (the 13th) that they had decided on the 11th to appoint Japanese companies, including Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Nissan Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., Teikoku Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Mitsubishi Corporation, Daito Fire and Marine Transportation Insurance Co., Ltd., Kobe Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Showa Shipping Co., Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Kokusai Transportation Co., Ltd., Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Nippon Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Asahi Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Chiyoda Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Toyo Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Tokyo Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Nippon Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Teikoku Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., Mitsui Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Teikoku Life Insurance Mutual Company, Chiyoda Life Insurance Mutual Company, Meiji Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co., Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co., and Nippon Life Insurance Co., to carry out the liquidation of over 110 companies, including Old Mow Kang Kee, Butterfield & Swire, New Sassoon, Palatine, Cheung Hing, Ping An, and Phoenix. At the same time, the Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued a statement, stipulating the liquidation methods, and delivered a speech, clarifying the significance of this measure.

The statement from the Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy reads: "Following the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy insurance companies managed by the Japanese Army and Navy will be ordered to cease their duties and undergo liquidation from today onwards. The liquidation affairs will be handled entirely by various Japanese companies. This is hereby declared on April 11th, 1942, by the Supreme Commanders of the Army and Navy in Shanghai." The Japanese Army and Navy authorities stated, "Regarding the liquidation of enemy insurance company businesses, the local Japanese Army and Navy authorities have decided that all enemy insurance companies managed since the Japanese military entered the concessions after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War will be ordered to cease operations and undergo liquidation. The Japanese authorities convened the managers of various enemy insurance companies at 2:00 PM on the 11th of this month to inform them of the above-mentioned policy decided by the Japanese authorities. The liquidation affairs of these managed insurance companies will be carried out by the Japanese insurance companies, but the sovereignty of the liquidation will remain with the Japanese military. The Japanese military will assign the various Japanese companies to handle the specific business. The method is the same as when the Japanese military handled the liquidation of enemy banks previously. Accounting supervisors have been appointed by the Japanese military to take over the various enemy insurance companies decided for liquidation, ceasing new business, and the recent business decline has in fact entered a state of stagnation. Furthermore, Japanese insurance companies will adopt a jointly responsible system to handle the insurance business of the enemy insurance companies to meet the needs of various customers. This measure will definitely not have any adverse effects on the financial and economic sectors of Shanghai. As for the debts to various creditors and customers, they will be paid immediately after the liquidation is completed and the remaining assets of the companies are determined. It is hoped that all concerned parties will understand the measures taken by the Japanese military and deal with them calmly."

### Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Sharply Then Plummet

The yarn market initially rose sharply due to the loosening of military currency. However, the spot market situation remains firm due to tight supplies. 42-count Blue Phoenix is 9,600 yuan to 9,350 yuan, 80-count Rainbow Ball is 27,700 yuan, 40-count Rainbow Ball is 8,300 yuan, 40-count Sunlight is 9,200 yuan, 32-count Great Joy is 8,050 yuan, 32-count Immortal Peach is 9,900 yuan, 20-count Sunlight is 5,300 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix is 5,500 yuan, new and old tax. 20-count Double Horse spot is 4,720 yuan to 4,705 yuan, 20-count Heavenly Maiden is 4,850 yuan, 20-count Double Globe is 4,733 yuan, 16-count Golden Pagoda is 4,800 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing is 4,850 yuan, 6-count Rouge Tiger is 5,100 yuan, 6-count Bear Bee is 4,450 yuan, 8-Count Three Tigers is 3,810 yuan, 10-Count Red Double Horse is 3,770 yuan, 10-Count New Treasure Yi is 3,480 yuan, 10-Count Boy Scout is 3,740 yuan, 10-Count Weaver Girl is 3,600 yuan. 20-count Double Horse mill orders initially opened at 3,750 yuan. At this time, buying interest was quite strong, rising to 3,820 yuan. Afterwards, it fluctuated between 3,750 yuan and 3,760 yuan for quite some time. Towards the close, it suddenly fell to 3,640 yuan. The closing price was 3,660 yuan.

### Piece Goods Prices Also Plunge

The piece goods market started firm but then weakened, with many sales orders being canceled. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth opened in the morning at 220 yuan, falling to 215 yuan. The lowest price for Flying Goose coarse cloth was 195 yuan. Although there were no transactions in fine cloth, supplies remained tight. 12-pound Big Peng spot requires 194 yuan, and Fortune is 185 yuan. Colored cloth is also relatively stable, with only a difference of one or two yuan per piece compared to last week. Poplin fell by about one jiao per yard. Longevity opened at 6.30 yuan, and Wan Benli was 6.25 yuan.

Eastern cloth prices fell sharply due to the continued decline of Japanese military currency. New orders for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 231-232 yuan, hovering for a long time. By the afternoon close, it had plunged to 226 yuan. The opening market in the afternoon was even softer, falling to 220 yuan. It then rose again to 225.5 yuan as military currency recovered, with short sellers covering their positions. The closing price was 226 yuan, but still down 7.5 yuan per piece from last week. Rainbow Ball fine cloth was 203 yuan, Treasure fine cloth was 185 yuan. The closing price for Four Gentlemen Serge was 6.85 yuan for orders for October to December, and 6.812 yuan for new tax red orders.

### Government Bonds Rise and Fall Erratically

The over-the-counter government bond market fluctuated greatly yesterday. It initially trended upwards as Yi Tai slowly bought in, with Class C rising to 1.80 yuan. Da Kangcheng then gradually began to sell in small quantities, with Class C reaching a high of 2 yuan. However, as the close approached, the market gradually declined. By the time of the closing, Da Kangcheng had suddenly sold off heavily, causing a uniform decline. The lowest price for Class C was 60 yuan and 4 jiao. Da Kangcheng's selling is still related to the matter I mentioned last Saturday. There were fears of still more unsold bonds, but the market rebounded immediately after the selling stopped, indicating that sentiment was still good. Da Kangcheng sold only 400,000 to 500,000 yuan worth yesterday, while Yi Tai bought in more than 300,000 yuan. Other sellers included Shunli, Bao Long, Tong Shun, Shun Tai, and Jiu Feng. In addition to Yi Tai, buyers included Gong Mao, Tong Li, Shun Heng, Hong Xing, Fu Hua, Wu He, Yi Chang, and Lian Yi, with Gong Mao buying the most. Da Kangcheng naturally still has some ammunition left, but it may not sell off every day, so the market may need to rebound slightly first. As a result, market prices uniformly fell by six jiao to two yuan. Transactions totaled about 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day

### Foreign Currencies Gradually Recover

The foreign currency market gradually recovered yesterday. The British pound and the US dollar each fell by ten yuan, the former to 430 yuan and the latter to 440 yuan. US dollar bills also fell to 32-33 yuan, while Hong Kong bills rose to 3.80 yuan, with large bills discounted by five fen. Military currency fluctuated unpredictably, opening at 7.45 yuan in the morning, falling to 6.80 yuan in the afternoon, and finally rising to 7.25 yuan, still one jiao lower than last Saturday.

### Spot Gold Market Quiet

The over-the-counter spot price of gold was extremely stable yesterday, as cash shops and silver shops had no transactions. The decline in military currency further fueled rumors of selling, but outside clients dragged in, so the market was held up. The initial price per tael (ten liang) in the morning was 18,650 yuan, then 18,700 yuan. At noon, the price was maintained with buyers, and the selling price was 18,750 yuan, slightly higher than last Saturday. Transactions were less than one hundred taels.

Silver shop jewelry gold was still listed at 1,950 yuan per liang by Da Xin and other shops (discounted by 200 yuan for purchases). Patterned silver was listed at 18 yuan, and the black market was 13.78 yuan. Silver coins were 8.23 yuan each and remained firm, but no transactions were reported.

### Spot Cash Premiums Increase

Yesterday, the interbank rate announced by the Money Trade Association was still seven fen, and the discount rate for checks was 37-38 yuan per thousand, an increase of two to three yuan.

### Shanghai Stock Market Fluctuates

Yesterday's Shanghai stock market was quiet, with prices fluctuating. New pharmaceutical stocks were strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Department store stocks, such as Yong An and Xin Xin, showed signs of strength. Transactions for Chinese underwear were active. Banks such as China Communications had buyers. Textile stocks, such as Da Feng Dyeing and Weaving and Hong Xing No. 3 Mill, were favored by investors. Industrial stocks, such as Great China Matches, continued to rise, with many buyers, but few sellers. Tianchu Seasoning also showed strength.

Furthermore, the official interest of 8% for Zhongxi Pharmacy for the 30th year has been distributed since February 10th. As for the dividend distribution, it has been decided to distribute 2 fen.

### How Can Thin Rice Be Stored for Long?

Due to the recent warm weather, the rough-grained and damp domestic rice cannot withstand being stored for even one or two days. Vendors from the suburbs sell as soon as they arrive. Stores and consumers prefer to buy in small quantities. Therefore, rumors about the early and late rice prices continued to be dumped all the way. The passport price in the French Concession fell from 400 yuan, reaching a low of 395 yuan, then rebounding to 390 yuan. The passport price in the British Concession fell from 415 yuan to 412-413 yuan, reaching 410 yuan. Compared to the price rumored the week before, it has already plummeted by more than ten yuan. Although it is a market with prices but no transactions, hearing these uncertain prices is like quenching thirst with plums. Only glutinous rice is stored separately, and there is an urgent need for supply. If a dozen or so loads of spot goods are obtained, they will be treated as precious as pearls, hence the rumor of 500 yuan per load.

### Miscellaneous Grains Remain Weak

Yesterday's miscellaneous grains market only had half a day of trading in the afternoon due to a meeting of the miscellaneous grains group to discuss investment matters. The market for various goods remained weak. Twenty bags of Chongming sand red were sold at 197 yuan, one hundred bags of Wuhu soybeans at 191 yuan, fifty bags of Pudong broad beans at 216 yuan, thirty bags of Jiangbei green beans at 216 yuan, and one hundred bags of Sanxin large bag bran at 90 yuan.

### Matches and Soap Markets Depressed

The market for daily necessities has been fluctuating recently, with prices showing signs of depression due to the heavy pressure of actual sales and restrictions. In addition, the price of cigarettes plummeted yesterday, and prices also followed suit. Phoenix brand matches fell to 5,000 yuan per box, slightly less than 500 yuan from the weekend. Gu Ben soap was 325 yuan, Bai Xiang soap was 310 yuan, and Huang Xiangmao soap was 210 yuan. The market is still stable. Military-sold matches have already been distributed, and they are still sold at the face value of 5 jiao in Japanese currency, equivalent to 4 yuan in national currency, with a limit of one package (ten small boxes) per person.

Chronicles

### Our Spring

— Wandering

A friend, after reading Ba Jin's "Spring in Autumn," said: "People have spring in autumn, but what about our spring?" His words were filled with emotion.

Another friend, after returning from seeing Ba Jin's stage play "Spring," said in the same tone: "Spring is ours, but what about our spring?"

I think it's not just my two friends who are excluded from spring. Just by opening the newspaper, you can see spring in the poets' pens; stepping onto the street, you can also see spring on the bodies of fashionable women; sneaking into the park, you can even see spring on the willow branches. But these are not what young people yearn for, and in the end, it only increases their disappointment.

Undeniably, the instability of life is a sharp blade that cuts off the connection between young people and spring, but spring is internal. As long as you can persevere in your "own" career under extremely harsh material conditions, you will feel the existence of spring in every bit of progress in that career. There can be spring in autumn, and there can be spring in winter.

Friend, aren't you distressed that our spring cannot be found? Let me tell you: apart from the spring in nature that can be anticipated, our spring can only be obtained through work. Otherwise, even if we shout "Spring is ours," we will always lose spring!

### So That's Why

— Nebula

A: "Why is universal oil rising so much?"

B: "Sales are good!"

A: "Are there more people with headaches?"

B: "Ask who doesn't have a headache when they hear about rising prices, except for hoarders?" Weicheng

### Advice to Grandmas and Madams

— Weicheng

According to ancient methods, a wife is called a "virtuous helper." In these times of war and chaos, if the husband cannot earn money, or if the money earned is not enough, and the wife cannot provide internal assistance, she may inevitably develop outward. Small sisters and movie stars talk at the mahjong table, and the next day they "buy something" hoping it will rise day and night, to make a little profit to supplement the household expenses, which is naturally a standard for a good wife.

Yesterday I heard a piece of news that I couldn't help but report to the grandmas and madams. A "virtuous helper" bought a box of foreign candles. When the price rose, she wanted to sell them, but who could she sell them to? She asked here and there, but all the people she asked were not the right people. One said: "If you don't register, it will be confiscated!" One said: "Although the price has risen, no one wants them." Still another used both intimidation and trickery to get her to sell at below "cost."

This may not be a fabricated story, and there are many grandmas and madams who speculate for no reason. Buying some daily necessities such as soap and matches at home can be said to be saving for a rainy day. A box of foreign candles, even if you lose money, is still harmless. Even more blindly listening to the "strange theories" of the sister-in-law upstairs and the auntie downstairs, turning banknotes into useless things and putting them under the bed, then there is really nowhere to cry.

In principle, if the price of the things you hoard rises, the standard of living must rise with it. So, what is the use of earning a little money if it is all spent on a family's rising expenses?

### Where Are the Subtenants Going?

— Bo

Being a subtenant in Shanghai is truly a lot of suffering. The first landlord twists his mouth, the second landlord dutifully obeys, and the one who suffers the most is our third party—the poor subtenant.

If the second landlord does not use the house as a "cash cow," then they will be able to stand up straight. The unreasonable rent increases by the first landlord, as well as the recent disguised rent increases requiring the acceptance of savings certificates, can be rejected, or at least reasonably argued against, to break the owner's "money desire" of only caring about raising rents regardless of whether the occupants can afford them.

But in fact, most of the second landlords in Shanghai have seized the opportunity to make good deals in recent years. The first landlords, seeing this point, have implemented a disguised "rent increase" of 30%, and the second landlords have had no choice but to "vigorously support" and force the subtenants to "fill the gap" in this unexpected loss.

Although the number of people returning to their hometowns from Shanghai is increasing day by day, vacant houses have not become more readily available. The second landlords tell the subtenants, "If you don't agree, please move out!" Our third party is once again stymied. So, fine, fine... fine, they have no choice but to reluctantly offer the increased rent of 30% with both hands.

Fine... fine... fine, fortunately the second landlords are not affected in the slightest. They—at least the majority—not only don't pay rent, but also make money on the house. Even if they do pay rent, it's very minimal. It's like "staying out of it," watching the subtenants grit their teeth, sweat, groan, and struggle from the clouds...

The Concession authorities have always upheld justice. They have drafted reasonable solutions for suppressing the excessive profits of second landlords. We hope that everything will be handled fairly. The subtenants are not unreasonably shouting for rent reduction!

### Neurasthenia

— Wang Ye

One afternoon, I happened to pass by a fortune teller who used Chinese characters. Suddenly, I noticed two golden rays shining from the phrase "improperly dressed." I went closer and saw it was a "noblewoman." The golden rays were coming from the golden earrings on her ears. I couldn't help but clap my leg and exclaim in surprise!

As the saying goes, "The poor consult fortune tellers, the rich burn incense." Since fortune telling is one of the methods of divination, then it naturally belongs to the "exclusive property" of the poor. But, a "noblewoman" wearing golden earrings, a fur coat, with graceful bearing and dignified elegance was actually standing in front of a fortune-telling stall...

I heard a bit of the "ending":

"Please rest assured... after the 27th, there will be no problem. By the third month, you will definitely make a profit!" The fortune teller squinted, seeming to be "divining with certainty."

"I'm afraid not... the goods won't sell... things are in a terrible state..." The "noblewoman" muttered for a while, twisting her waist and, with two golden rays, walked away.

Only then did I realize.

Those who are hoarding goods these days are not having a good time either! As soon as the goods are in, they worry about the price dropping early, and they worry about the price dropping late. In their dreams, they drop so much they wake up in fright! It turns into neurasthenia.

Being so anxious that they are at their wit's end and go to a fortune teller, means that their neurasthenia has already reached an incurable stage, and medicine is ineffective!

### Inside and Outside the Coffin

— Feng Ma Niu

There is a piece of "gossip news" in the newspaper: A rogue, suffering from illness, was refused accommodation by an inn and was also driven away from the neighborhood. So, having no other choice, he actually had a "whimsical idea" and placed his sick body in an empty coffin in a place where corpses are collected, causing the passers-by to be horrified, suspecting it was haunted, and so on.

This method is actually quite clever. He can recuperate in the coffin, and if he can't get up, he can die peacefully there. Although this "rogue" is not qualified for the "gas car" to "transport the body," he can at least save the corpse collectors in the charity hall the labor of moving him. But speaking of it, it is a sad thing. Since he cannot survive, driven by hunger and cold, and he is also sick, he certainly has no money to hire a doctor, and can only groan in an empty coffin, waiting for death. This scene, adorning the Qingming Festival, cannot but make passers-by want to lose their souls.

"Seeing a living ghost in broad daylight," but there is no need to be horrified. Are not many people struggling in the mud river of life groping in a coffin every day, living through these dark days?

But those who live outside the coffin are carefree and happy. They make deals that kill without spilling blood. In their right hand, they buy and sell medicine for severe colds, aspirin, and other such drugs; in their left hand, they hoard products for the summer, such as medicated oil and Watson's products. Letting kites fly in the wind, enjoying the pleasure of the moment in late spring, is it not wonderful?

However, it fits a Shanghai saying: "Sleeping by the coffin." Although it is dangerous, there are still many people who like to "sleep" there. Although there are many "living ghosts" in the "coffin," most of those who "sleep by the coffin" have a heart of stone, so they have the appetite for a pleasant "spring nap," especially since they are after all outside the "coffin," with coffee and hot dogs to eat and "spiritual morning dances" to dance.

Inside and outside the "coffin," although separated by only one layer of poplar wood, are two different worlds!

### In the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(Three) Guests Arrive

The magpie first waited on Wei Cheng to wash his face. When Wei Cheng went to burn incense and kowtow, the crying inside the mourning curtain was only Sister Cui Zhen alone. When Mother He saw Wei Cheng come to kowtow, she hurried in to tell Cui Zhen, and Cui Zhen stopped crying as well: it was also because Second Madam Ye had instructed her in advance not to cry and arouse Wei Cheng's grief. After a while, Wei Cheng wanted to talk to Sister Cui Zhen, but when he asked, he found out that Cui Zhen had gone back to her uncle's house. Second Madam Ye said, "Today is New Year's Eve, Cui Zhen came in the midst of her busy schedule. Cui Zhen said that her uncle had lost money gambling these past two days and pawned the clothes of his wife and daughter, so he didn't give Cui Zhen a good look, and would say that he would sell her to a brothel in Shanghai. It's okay for her to come here; Fei Changhe wouldn't say anything. If she goes elsewhere, that won't do." Wei Cheng sighed.

The New Year's Eve passed coldly. Wei Cheng waited for Huang Long to come, but Huang Long didn't come; waited for Cui Zhen to come, but Cui Zhen didn't come either. Second Madam Ye said, "Wei Cheng, you won't be able to study next year. You'll have to send someone to retrieve your books and luggage from the school in Suzhou." Wei Cheng said, "I'm not going to study anymore. The luggage and books can stay there, they won't be lost, there's no hurry." Because Second Madam Ye mentioned Suzhou, Wei Cheng thought of the Chen siblings from Shuangqiao. His mind was very confused, and in his confusion, the shadows of the Chen siblings were added. He thought to himself: I shouldn't let them know; if they knew, they would surely shed tears for me.
