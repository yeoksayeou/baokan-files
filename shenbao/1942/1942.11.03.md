### Actively Preparing for Winter Offensive: Soviet Union Forms Special Corps; New Air Force Units Strengthened; German Aircraft Concentrate Bombing, Inflicting Heavy Losses

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – The Soviet Union plans to launch a second winter offensive on the Eastern Front in an attempt to shatter the symbolic initiative of the [German] army. This appears increasingly evident. It is reported that large Soviet reinforcements have recently arrived in areas southeast of Vitebsk, Sukhinichi, and Rzhev. German reconnaissance has also detected the Soviets organizing a special corps in the Toropets area, called the "Stalin Corps." Southeast of Toropets, a new armored corps is being formed, composed of motorized brigades and rifle divisions, but its unit strength is extremely weak. This indicates the difficulty the Soviet Union faces in recruiting new soldiers and the lack of equipment. The Soviet air force in the aforementioned areas has also been reinforced, with an addition of over two hundred aircraft, mostly transferred from the northern section of the Eastern Front. The Soviet army is also busy digging trenches, and their preparations for an offensive appear very active. German aircraft are currently targeting enemy concentrations, artillery positions, supply depots, and railway lines as primary bombing targets. Repeated bombing raids have inflicted heavy losses on the Soviet army. Artillery battles are very active in Stalingrad. Many Soviet artillery positions on the eastern bank of the Volga have been destroyed by German artillery fire. Fighting is currently ongoing in the factory district. Soviet resistance is gradually collapsing. Despite suffering significant losses, the Soviet army is still attempting to send reinforcements across the Volga River, but these attempts have been thwarted by German artillery and bombers. The air force on the northern section of the Eastern Front is more active. German aircraft have raided airfields south of Murmansk, hitting barracks and destroying several aircraft on the ground. All German aircraft returned safely.

Berlin, 1st (Havas Agency) – The German High Command has issued a battle report stating: (1) Several Soviet units north of Stalingrad attempted to cross the Volga River in small boats, but were completely unsuccessful. The enemy troops either drowned due to capsized boats or were annihilated or captured by our forces. Their artillery positions on the west bank of the river were also bombed and strafed by our aircraft. (2) Soviet forces south of Stalingrad continue to launch attacks, but without effect. (3) North of Astrakhan, our aircraft hit thirteen enemy trains. (4) Soviet attempts to cross the Don River front have been repeatedly repelled by Italian forces. (5) On the Tuapse port front, our forces broke through several Soviet lines. Enemy counterattacks have been repelled. One enemy cargo ship in the port was also sunk by our aircraft. (6) On the Terek River front, our assault troops, under air cover, broke through Soviet defenses, forcing the enemy to retreat. (7) Nine Soviet ships in the Caspian Sea were hit and set on fire by our air force, including four oil tankers. (8) South of Lake Ilmen on the northern front, all Soviet counterattacks have failed. (9) In the Lake Ladoga area, the enemy lost one cargo ship, one tugboat, and one heavily damaged mosquito boat.

Berlin, 1st (Domei Agency) – German sources report that German and Romanian forces fought fiercely in the Terek River region of the Caucasus front, annihilating most of the Soviet Thirty-seventh Army. The remaining units were also heavily damaged. The Soviet 295th Infantry Division and the Second Grenadier Regiment were completely wiped out. The 255th Infantry Division and the 59th Assault Brigade also lost their combat effectiveness and suffered significant losses.

Berlin, 2nd (Havas Agency) – The High Command announced this morning that German and Romanian forces on the Soviet front have occupied Anagire, 25 miles southwest of the town of Ochanikizi in the Terek River area. Well-informed sources here say that this move is of great significance because the Red Army can no longer reach a certain highway.

### Turkish Parliament Opens: President Delivers Speech: Maintaining Neutral Policy Very Difficult; If Forced to Enter the War, Will Strive for Glory

Istanbul, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – Turkish President İsmet İnönü delivered a speech at the opening of parliament yesterday, stating: “The war has drawn the majority of nations into a whirlpool, and the people in the rear are also suffering from the war's impact, which is regrettable. The war's development proves that nations attempting to dominate cannot last. The ideal of maintaining independence and glory for each nation will be recognized by the world. This ideal is the foundation of Turkish national policy, which we are pleased to maintain. Currently, there are no signs of reconciliation among the warring nations. The war in 1943 may become even more intense. The Turkish people should unite, abide by treaties, be loyal to friendly nations, and continue to maintain the policy of national security, avoiding hypocritical attitudes. As the war expands daily, the Turkish government finds it very difficult to maintain a neutral policy, a sentiment shared by the National Assembly. Turkey will continue to uphold its national policy and will at any time clarify Turkey’s relations with all countries. It is hoped that this national policy stance will be understood by all nations. Turkey has achieved significant progress in finance and agriculture. The increasing impact of the war on Turkey and the threat of disorder are shaking Turkey's position. The people feel the country's weakness, and the feeling of weakness can easily invite external crises. Therefore, the National Assembly must discuss the possibility of attacks, regardless of where the attacks come from or what justifications are given. The Turkish people are experiencing the pain of speculation and rising living costs. This situation must be addressed. The government will propose various suggestions. No nation has a panacea to prevent all difficulties. All nations will inevitably encounter difficulties. We must alleviate suffering, strengthen our determination to resist, and avoid being drawn into the war. If forced to enter the war, we should strive to achieve a glorious conclusion. The Turkish government is moving towards this goal.” Finally, İsmet harshly warned speculators and politicians who stir up trouble or are bought off by foreign countries, stating that Turkey will not tolerate them harming the country or promoting policies that run counter to national policy.

Istanbul, 2nd (Havas Agency) – Parliament held its first meeting yesterday and then adjourned until the 19th of this month.

### Naval Training Class Moves from Shanghai to Nanjing: Wang Jingwei Personally Attends and Delivers Training

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Naval Advanced Cadre Training Class of the Naval Department recently moved from Shanghai to Nanjing and is continuing its training in the Naval Department's auditorium.

### Britain Strengthens Near East Defenses: Defensive Works Constructed in Syria; Troops Increased on Cyprus

Stockholm, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – Newspapers here yesterday carried news from Istanbul stating that Britain is currently constructing strong defensive works in Syria. Important strategic points along the coast have been fortified. Many technical experts are conducting this work throughout the region.

Syrian Border Area, 1st (Havas Agency) – The British High Command is currently taking various measures to strengthen the defenses of the British-held island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean. The Allied side feels that the Axis powers may launch an attack on this fortress. After the arrival of Indian troops and several squadrons of aircraft, the strength of the garrison on the island has been greatly enhanced. Large-scale exercises and drills have been held on the island for several weeks. Once occupied, Cyprus will become an outpost for the Axis powers approaching the Near East and Egypt, not only serving as an excellent base for fleets and submarines but also as an airfield from which German and Italian aircraft can bomb enemy oil pipelines and vital transportation lines in the Near East. British military experts believe that the island is about to be subjected to air raids and even a landing war is not impossible because the coastal area of the island is flat and suitable for landing operations. At that time, Italy will concentrate all its naval power to protect the landing.

### Regular Meetings of Japanese Local Officials

### North African Battlefield: British Offensive Obstructed; Cabinet Member Casey Inspects the Frontline in Egypt; Allied Aircraft Bomb Crete

Berlin, 2nd (Havas Agency) – The official announcement this morning stated that the German and Italian forces launched a successful counterattack yesterday on the Al Alamein front, and the enemy offensive was contained and suffered heavy losses.

Rome, 2nd (Havas Agency) – The High Command announced this morning that the Axis forces gained an advantage in the counterattack in the northern sector of the Egyptian front yesterday, capturing 100 Australian soldiers and destroying 40 tanks. The enemy in the area continued to attack under heavy artillery fire. Last night, the enemy attempted to land behind the Axis forces, but were repelled. German and Italian aircraft repeatedly attacked enemy lines and were successful. German aircraft shot down four enemy aircraft and destroyed eleven at the airfield.

Stockholm, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – London reports that British Cabinet Member for Egypt Casey is currently inspecting the front lines in Al Alamein.

Buenos Aires, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – Local newspapers quoted former British War Minister Hore-Belisha as saying that the Axis defense line at El Alamein is extremely strong, and it is not easy to pave the way for large tank forces.

The quantity of aircraft, artillery, and military supplies transported by Britain and the United States is unprecedented. However, he also pointed out that the Axis defensive works have formidable defensive power, with strong fortresses and artillery and machine guns scattered everywhere. The British forces may need to engage in a prolonged and arduous battle to succeed.

Stockholm, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – "The Sunday Times of London" reported that the German forces launching a counterattack in the Al Alamein area had been repelled, and the British forces again launched a fierce attack on the Axis positions.

### More Than Forty US States Hold Gubernatorial Elections Today: Victory of Governors and Congressmen Will Provide a Glimpse into Public Opinion's Attitude Toward the President

Buenos Aires, 1st (Central News Agency) – The first indirect election in the United States since the start of the war will be held on the 3rd in more than forty states across the country. The election results will reveal the attitude of American public opinion towards Roosevelt's wartime policies. Observers here declared that the American people's attention is currently focused on the progress of the Pacific war situation, and they do not seem to be very concerned about the election. It is expected that the number of abstentions will increase by about ten million compared to 1940. Historically, a large number of abstentions have benefited the Republican Party. The following two factors are reasons for expecting Republican Party members to be easily elected: 1. The general public is deeply dissatisfied with the war policies adopted by Roosevelt, who comes from the Democratic Party, especially his economic policies of controlling prices and preventing inflation. 2. Usually, six million soldiers support the Democratic Party, but now they have abstained. 3. Since the start of the war, ordnance workers have not obtained the right to vote due to factory relocation. When Roosevelt ran for president in 1940, he used the international crisis in Europe and East Asia to win over the people. This time, he also tried to use military actions to entice the people. After the battle in the South Pacific began, he greatly publicized the favorable situation. After the Japanese general headquarters issued a battle report exposing the truth of the war, the American media also admitted the defeat. Roosevelt's hopes have vanished. A certain Democratic member of Congress once said that if the Pacific battle fails, the consequences would be terrifying, and the people's rationality would also be lost because of it. Well-informed sources believe that the American defeat in this battle has a great impact on indirect elections, and, as generally expected, a large number of Republican Party members can be elected. It is expected that unless the general trend changes drastically, Roosevelt's regime may not experience a violent upheaval. However, at present, the argument about the guidance of the war, with the faction advocating that the United States fight for the United States itself, is the most powerful, so it is not as enthusiastic about helping Britain and the United Nations as before.

Lisbon, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – New York newspapers are making various speculations about tomorrow's elections for governors and members of Congress. The Republican newspaper "Tribune" predicts that the Republican Party will win a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. The Democratic newspaper "Times" predicts that the Democratic Party will retain the majority. The newspapers strongly assert that the election of the Governor of New York will show the trend of the 1944 presidential election. Most newspapers believe that the Republican candidate, Dewey, will only narrowly defeat the Democratic candidate, Bennett. If Dewey is elected Governor, he will likely be nominated as the Republican presidential candidate in the 1944 election because the Governor of New York is often a stepping stone to the presidency.

### Portuguese Parliament Holds Elections

Lisbon, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – The Portuguese Parliament held elections yesterday. Under the current circumstances, the elections can be considered a referendum on Prime Minister Salazar's neutral policy and the social and financial measures implemented by the government. The results of the election depend on the voting in various territories, so the results may not be announced until the middle of next week at the earliest.

Lisbon, 2nd (Havas Agency) – Preliminary results of the parliamentary elections have been announced. In the capital region, the government party has received 130,120 votes out of 168,880. In other constituencies, the government party has received 232,924 votes out of 375,750. According to Interior Minister Sousa, the number of voters in this election is unprecedented.

### Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: Africa in a Time of Tumultuous Change – Egypt: The Second Gateway to the Great War (Part 2)

If we were to travel to Egypt, we would see that this ancient country, like China, still preserves many ancient customs. In the open spaces of the city corners, we can often see beggars, or traveling performers, playing with snakes. In tea houses and taverns—recently converted into coffee shops—there are many impoverished scholars reciting stories, much like the storytellers in our country's teahouses. In families, they place great emphasis on filial piety; in customs, they are very hospitable to travelers. Their music, though simple, is like our ancient music, pure, profound, and serene. One particularly similar point is that our famous mountains are mostly dotted with ancient temples in dense forests, while in Egypt, there are many tombs of famous people and sages.

A country like this seems like it shouldn't be plagued by war and become so distressed. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that it invites the jealousy of others? But this kind of thinking is somewhat outdated in this 20th century of roaring dragons and tigers. If we take a brief look at the global trends of the past century, we will see that today's Earth, whether land or sea, from the North and South Poles, cold to 50 degrees below freezing, to the equatorial deserts, hot to over 100 degrees, can hardly find an inch of paradise.

That being said, how exactly has Egypt become a gateway to the heart of the war?

Before the First World War, we knew that the Germans were already planning to seize all the rich resources of the Near East. The focus of this plan was the Berlin-to-Baghdad railway. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq, majestically situated on the Mesopotamian plateau. If this railway plan had been realized, the German iron fist would have stretched out from Europe to grab the head and heart of the Near East.

From the British point of view, the Eastern India, Burma, the South Sea Islands, and Australia are all her lifeline. Within the circle of the Near East, including Arabia, she has been steadily advancing. Given this situation, the British must maintain a vital transportation route, connecting these areas of interest like pearls, one by one. Of course, departing from the British mainland, one could go south along Africa, around the Cape of Good Hope, and then reach the edge of the Near East and arrive in India. But since the Suez Canal was built, a new route has been added, which is to enter the Mediterranean Sea from Gibraltar, pass through the Suez Canal, and reach the Indian Ocean via the Red Sea, and so on.

Initially, when the British chose the Mediterranean route, they were wholeheartedly trying to cultivate good relations with the Italians, and their greatest concern was Soviet Russia because the Soviet Russian hand extending from the Black Sea was also quite formidable. In 1878, the British army occupied the island of Cyprus precisely to resist this threat. More than 30 years later, the situation changed, and Turkey joined the war, turning the Dardanelles into an undefended zone. Although the British were sweating, they were united with Italy and France, and with their strong navy, they were still swaggering freely in the Mediterranean without hindrance. Eventually, Turkey revived and reclaimed the defense of the Dardanelles from the Europeans. The British hid behind the scenes and did not speak out because they thought that with their diplomatic skills and military backing, the Turks would probably not obstruct their Mediterranean route. On the contrary, this would cut off the Soviet Union's relationship with the Mediterranean, wouldn't they be happy to play dumb?

The above two points explain part of Egypt's importance.

However, since the outbreak of the current war, the situation in the Mediterranean has undergone great changes. First, let's talk about Germany's Berlin-to-Baghdad railway plan. Since it didn't achieve its goal, why not try again this time? We see her stretching out two large claws, one towards the Caucasus and the other pressing hard on Egypt. This creates a confusing problem: since her goal is focused on the oil fields and mineral resources of the Near East, why not simply crush Turkey like a mountain pressing on an egg and then build a railway openly? Why bother stretching one claw into an icy cave while scorching the other in a hot desert?

But we know that the Germans are not necessarily fools. Even though the Near East, including Saudi Arabia, possesses unlimited resources, these people are all Eastern peoples, and within this large circle, they all believe in Islam. Since Turkey's revolution, although religious freedom is allowed, the influence of Islam is still deeply ingrained in the Turkish blood and may be difficult to erase for decades or even centuries. At the same time, Turkey is naturally the leader among the Near Eastern nations. Imagine, even if the Germans crushed the Turks like a mountain pressing on an egg, would she still plan to enjoy peace in the Near East?

Recognizing this point, the Germans have always been so sweet and gentle in their dealings with Turkey, euphemistically calling it a "policy of appeasement." Coincidentally, the Turks' diplomatic skills are also excellent, and their goal is to work hard to strengthen their country, regardless of what the Germans are up to.

The fact that the Germans are so careful with the Near East and Turkey is largely due to the lessons they have learned from the British's hard work in the Near East. We only need to briefly review the British notes, travelogues, and novels about the Near East to know how they have been working meticulously there.

This explains why the Germans do not want to offend Turkey, but at the same time, they want to reach the rich resources of the Near East, so they are desperately trying to tear apart the Soviet Union and Great Britain. If they ever become entangled in the Near East, the Near East will have no say because they are fighting two enemies, and they have no grievances with the countries of the Near East. At that time, as soon as they shake hands, everyone, including Turkey, will be friends.

As mentioned earlier, one claw in the Caucasus is already freezing, so now they have to mobilize the claw in Africa. To go to Africa, they can certainly use Italy's stepping stones to cross the Mediterranean by air. However, the British bases in the Mediterranean are numerous and strong, so the German approach is to try to attack the British bases in the sea as much as possible, while pushing the giant claw forward.

Then, are these British children willing to stay there and wait to be caught? Of course not. Since they are not willing, do they have any plans? Of course, they do. Isn't the call for a second front becoming increasingly louder, while Churchill is always refusing to express his opinion? Perhaps he believes that the affairs in North Africa are the trigger for launching the second front. Moreover, in military operations, everything is virtual and real, and one must be careful with fire. If he tells the people the military secrets, news travels ten thousand miles in a second these days, and international spies are ubiquitous and unpredictable. If he reveals the plans, wouldn't he be clearly telling people the entire defense plan?

But it is a fact that the British have already launched an offensive in North Africa at this time. In fact, this is not a new plan. It is still the old British's steady plan: first, turn the three islands into an impregnable fortress to protect the head and heart; second, connect the lifelines and try to maintain traffic in the Mediterranean. To maintain this transportation line, the most important strongholds must be well defended. Among these strongholds in the Mediterranean, North Africa is of course the main one, and Egypt is a center.

### Increased Edible Oil Rationing; Orders Being Negotiated; Citizens Can Report Black Market Prices

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the person in charge of the edible oil wholesale office, the average monthly allocation of edible oil over the past eight months has been around 20,000 dan. It is estimated that there are more than 2,200 registered edible oil retail stores in this city. In addition to separately supplying more than 3,000 dan per month to restaurants, stir-fry shops, fried bean curd shops, cake shops, and other businesses, there are still 17,000 dan left to be distributed to the above-mentioned retail stores. Each store can only be allocated about eight dan per month, which is about 26 or 27 jin per day. Considering the amount, it is certainly not enough to meet the sales demand. Given this fact, and with the current peak sales season in winter, the office has increased the rationing quantity by more than 6,000 dan last month. Currently, an order for 1,000 tons is being negotiated. If successful, the supply of edible oil in this city can be greatly increased. As for the black market price, citizens can report it.

### Winter Relief to Be Handled Early

Three Religions Moral Association to Start Today; Donations of Clothing and Congee Are Welcome

Due to the impact of rising prices this year, impoverished citizens are crying out in hunger and cold and feel especially miserable. In recent days, the discovery of frozen corpses on the streets has been continuous. The Three Religions Moral Benevolent Association has not interrupted its work to rescue the poor and help orphans and widows. It has also decided to start winter relief early today.

### Urgently Seeking Young Girls; Sentenced to Imprisonment

Mei Zhezhi, 49 years old, resides on Yu Yuan Road. In 1940, he purchased a girl named Hu Xiuying, and later purchased a young girl named Li Rongfang in Suzhou. He confined the two girls to the third floor of his residence and ordered the maid Chen Xu to strictly guard them. He also ordered Chen Xu to use silk and wooden molds to bind the feet of Hu and Li for two years. Because the two girls suffered injuries to their foot bones and could not bear the pain, they cried out miserably. As this continued day after day, it aroused the suspicion of the neighbors. In late September, the police station was notified to send police to investigate. The two victimized girls, Hu Xiuying and Li Rongfang, together with the girl's guard, female criminal Chen Xu (46 years old), were escorted to the Nanshi Local Court. Public prosecution was initiated on charges of obstructing freedom, etc. The principal offender was at large, so the trial could not be held. The authorities specifically ordered strict apprehension to uphold humanity. Mei was arrested on October 27 (last week) and released on bail pending trial. Yesterday morning (2nd), this case was tried. The defendant still did not appear in court, so the court announced the verdict. The main text read: Mei Zhezhi, for instigating the binding of the feet of a girl under the age of 16, thereby obstructing her natural physical development, is sentenced to one year of imprisonment and one year of deprivation of civil rights. The other charges of obstructing freedom are not guilty. Chen Xu, for binding the feet of a girl under the age of 16, thereby obstructing her natural physical development, is sentenced to six months of imprisonment. The other charges of obstructing freedom are not guilty. The wooden molds and bandages used for foot binding are confiscated.

Just as he was searching on the fifth floor, someone named Jia, who worked in the military police, happened to be there and stepped forward to inquire. Chen stammered and could not answer, and it was then discovered that he was an imposter of military personnel. Jia then called for his arrest, and Chen was detained in the Lao Zha Police Station.

### Identity Cards in the French Concession Expected to Be Fully Issued This Month

Regarding the issuance of identity cards in the French Concession, since the French Concession Police Department began issuing them on July 1 of this year through the Baojia offices in the six districts of Central, Avenue Joffre, Avenue Petain, and Xiaodongmen, more than four months have passed. Apart from some citizens in each district who have already obtained them, more than half of the citizens in other districts such as Central District and Avenue Foch District have not yet obtained them. However, a certain Baojia person claimed that the authorities' issuance of identity cards lasted for four months, except for a suspension of half a month due to the issuance of rice purchase permits. It has not been interrupted since then and is now being intensified. It is expected that the entire issuance can be completed by the end of the month at the latest.

### Cotton Cloth Speculators; Arrested Twice Without Success

Cotton Cloth Industry Requests Restoration of Yarn and Cloth Trading

Although cotton cloth speculators in this city have been repeatedly arrested by the authorities, they disregard the law, risk breaking the law, and run around to find new territory in tea houses and other places, intensifying their activities and engaging in "kick the ball" speculation, causing the price of cloth on the market to rise crazily. The authorities are quite disgusted and have taken strict measures, with plainclothes detectives from the Central Police Department patrolling and inspecting various black market places such as "yarn and cloth," "leading enterprises," and "cotton cloth associations." A reporter from the Central News Agency visited various markets yesterday and saw that these people had changed their tactics and continued to trade on the third or second floor of yarn and cloth shops, like "gambling gatherings," and hired people to keep watch. When they saw a detective, they would report it and scatter and flee. At around 11:00 a.m. and 2:35 p.m. yesterday, the Central Police Department sent police cars to arrest them twice, but both times failed. However, the market price of yarn and cloth has gradually declined due to the resulting panic.

Also, since the Public Industry Association approved the resumption of stock and bond trading, the people in charge of the Cotton Cloth Trading Exchange have also submitted a request to the authorities to resume cotton yarn trading in the exchange. It is said that the authorities have agreed to consider it, but whether it will be approved remains to be verified.

### Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Sends Personnel to Supervise Sugar Sales; Personnel Stationed Permanently for Allocations of 30 Packages or More; Spot Checks on Sugar Quality and Re-weighing for the Rest

Sugar Purchase Limited to Once Per Person Per Day with Certificate

Since the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office adopted a method of popularizing sugar purchases among food households, all shops selling sugar on the first day must provide it based on citizens' certificates, and it is stipulated that each person is limited to buying one yuan's worth. Since then, profiteers have been unable to operate. The full number of supervisors stationed in the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office is 118, who go to various retail sugar shops to supervise the sales situation. Regarding the names and distribution of the supervisors, a total of 96 shops have been allocated more than 20 packages of sugar, and one supervisor is stationed in each shop. For shops allocated less than 30 packages of sugar, 22 supervisors will go to various shops by bicycle for inspection. The inspection method is to extract one package of sugar from each package of sugar packaged the night before to check the quality of the sugar and to re-weigh whether the weight is accurate.

Weight of Each Package of Sugar

The weight of each package of sugar sold for five yuan in savings certificates is 1.2 liang on a balance scale and 1.6 liang on a market scale. If residents find any shortage or deduction after purchasing and re-weighing, they can report it to the police station for punishment. When purchasing sugar, the citizen's certificate must have its number registered by the sugar-selling shop to prevent repeated purchases. If there is any situation of repeated purchases for profit, the shop can also report it to the police station for punishment. There have been no disturbances in recent days. However, whether this method of purchasing sugar is temporary or permanent will depend on future circumstances.

### Aftermath of the Yangjiadu Fire; More Than 3,000 Houses and Straw Sheds Destroyed; Total Relief Funds Exceed 160,000 Yuan

On the 24th of last month, a major fire occurred in Yangjiadu, Pudong South District, burning an area of approximately four square li. A total of 1,497 households and 6,574 people were affected in Yangjiadu and Zhangjiabang. 288 houses and 3,138 straw sheds were destroyed. At that time, due to the strong winds and the depletion of water sources, and the close proximity of the straw sheds, which would catch fire as soon as they were near the flames, firefighting was quite difficult. It was extinguished with the joint efforts of the police station fire brigade, friendly army, navy, army police, and the customs fireboats. For the post-disaster measures, the police station coordinated with the district office to handle it. Those victims who had relatives and friends who could temporarily stay were ordered to go to them first. For those who had nowhere to stay, several places such as the Jiuda Fine Salt Company and temples were prepared to accommodate them. According to reports from the relief committee and the city government, personnel have been sent to survey the disaster situation and comfort the people. The city government has decided to distribute relief funds of 20 yuan per person, regardless of age, and an additional 10 yuan per household. Special commissioners, together with local Chinese and Japanese officials and business representatives, and personnel from the Shanghai Public Association of the Relief Committee, will go to distribute the funds today. The total amount of relief funds is more than 160,000 yuan. In addition to the generous donations from local landlords, officials, and businessmen today, and 50,000 yuan allocated by the Relief Committee, the deficit will be fully provided by the city government.

### Booming Charcoal Manufacturing Industry; Factories in Western Shanghai Reduce Work

The 工部局's (Shanghai Municipal Council) industrial report for October states that charcoal manufacturing is an emerging industry. As far as the Industrial and Social Affairs Department knows, there are currently 12 charcoal factories in the Public Concession. These factories often emit smoke during the charcoal production process, which interferes with the neighbors. The Bureau has received letters from citizens requesting that these factories be banned. Therefore, the Bureau stipulates that such factories are not allowed to be established without the Bureau's permission. Three bleaching powder factories were added last month and started working under the supervision of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department. There are now seven bleaching powder factories in the Concession. Five factories that extract coffee essence have recently been established, and several others that were closed during the summer have now resumed work.

As a result, 2,166 factories were found to have been established in the area in the past, of which 451 have now been closed, 409 have stopped working, and the remaining 1,208 are still operating, but on a reduced scale. The total number of workers employed by these factories in the past was 109,445, but has now been reduced to 45,135.

Government Bonds Flooding the Market, Drop Another Four Yuan

The informal market for government bonds continued its downward trend yesterday. Selling pressure remained extremely strong, with major players actively selling. Short covering gradually decreased. Class C bonds opened at 56 yuan, down 2.1 yuan from the previous week's closing price. Although they briefly rose to 6.5 yuan, the selling pressure did not diminish, and they continued to fall, breaking through 5 yuan. At that time, Class A bonds opened, with the first transaction at 53 yuan, a drop of 4 yuan. The market then announced the termination of trading, which further weakened confidence. All bonds subsequently fell by 4 yuan and trading ceased. In the informal market, they fell another 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. It is rumored that the General Chamber of Commerce has received approval from the authorities to conduct securities auctions soon, but there are still issues regarding pricing. However, after two consecutive days of declines, they have already fallen by a substantial 8 yuan. Old short positions have been covered in significant quantities, and many new short positions have been entered. It is uncertain whether new long positions will be tempted to enter the market. Therefore, it is difficult to predict today's market conditions. Perhaps it will start well and then decline. The market price results show continued declines of 4 yuan each, with only 96 bonds down 0.66 yuan. Approximately 3.3 to 3.4 million yuan worth of transactions were completed.

Longans About to Be Upside Down: Recently, the appetite for longan meat has decreased, while the source has gradually increased, so the selling price has softened. The degree of decline has been nearly one-tenth. However, at the same time, production prices are rising, such as in Shima and Tongan, which are all up by 45% compared to the lowest price. In addition, external costs have increased by tens of yuan, and a situation of upside down may soon form.

Top-Grade Mustard Greens Tight: Recently, the production cost of mustard greens has been high, making purchases difficult, and demand is strong, so the trend is tightening. Shipments to merchants are particularly scarce, so the asking price for good-quality sharp-colored goods is gradually rising by 30 to 50 yuan, and market prices are also rising accordingly.

Salvia Miltiorrhiza Dealers Holding Firm: For the goods that arrived earlier, insiders are still offering unreasonably low prices. The sellers are holding firm and not selling. Supply is scarce, while demand remains strong. Both upstream and downstream are calling for a 50 yuan increase and are still in negotiations.

Cigarettes Still Soaring: Stockpilers are stopping selling and starting to buy, and local demand is also strong, so all brands are favored by buyers. British brands are selling for 9,300 yuan, Old Knife for 8,200 yuan, Pin Hai for 8,100 yuan, Five Flowers for 7,000 yuan, Fairy for 7,200 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun for 3,200 yuan, Golden Building for 3,500 yuan, Red Rose for 2,750 yuan, All Lucky for 3,400 yuan, Nian Zhi for 3,100 yuan, Double Ax for 3,400 yuan, Compass for 2,750 yuan, National cigarettes Pyramid for 6,000 yuan, Beautiful for 5,300 yuan, Golden Mouse for 3,850 yuan, Golden Dragon for 3,200 yuan, and Great Linked Beads for 2,900 yuan, all higher than weekend prices.

Horse Mane Satin Transactions: Horse mane satin is essential for making thick and thin coat linings and sleeves, and is currently in season, so transactions continue. Brand companies have successively opened direct and indirect orders. Daya Silk Weaving horse mane satin is wholesaled at 20 yuan per yard, Chengfeng Yarn Weaving sells for 19.5 yuan, Datong Flying Boat brand first-class 27 yuan, second-class 25 yuan, third-class 21 yuan.

Sesame Nails Dull Sales: Yesterday's market saw very few transactions, with only two or three boxes sold at the retail level. The path for out-of-towners and local manufacturers is sluggish, so the sesame nail market is depressed. Asking prices are hovering. Yesterday, the market price for three-point flower color was 1,400 yuan per box, four-point 1,300 yuan, five-point 1,200 yuan, six-point 1,100 yuan, three-point Western nails 1,500 yuan, original nails still 700 yuan per bucket, four-point nails 1,200 yuan, one-point flower color 1,100 yuan per bucket.

### Autumn's Revelation

— Yiran

"Boundless falling leaves descend rustling, Endless Yangtze River surges on," As the autumn wind rises, withered yellow branches and leaves are stripped bare, leaving only the vast Yangtze River eternally surging.

Recently, I have noticed many people who understand the difficulties of learning, who possess the spirit of diligent training, and who have the desire and perseverance to serve the public. This is something worth recording and a positive sign that society will be saved.

The quality of a society lies entirely with its members. Of course, there are also many people who waste their time of learning, engaging in decadent lifestyles. This kind of social mediocrity is not only unnecessary for society but will eventually be eliminated.

The shedding of leaves and the continuous flow of the river offer profound lessons to people.

### Invigorate Student Spirit

— Linong

Students should clearly understand their position and responsibilities in the face of environmental difficulties. Look! How many people want to enter the doors of schools, but cannot. How many parents bear heavy burdens for their children's education, but are still disheartened. There are not a few students who lack clear understanding. In the current situation, should students have ample rest? Yet, some students seek entertainment and engage in romantic relationships during their free time. In the current situation, should students bury themselves in their studies? Yet, some students take leave to speculate in the markets. In the current situation, reading and listening to lectures is a valuable right, yet some students still form gangs and make trouble for teachers. Is this kind of behavior beneficial to students themselves? I dare say, it is not only unhelpful but also harmful. The result is the cultivation of selfish individuals in society. Mencius said: "When superiors and inferiors mutually contend for profit, the state is endangered." Society has already been made chaotic by a group of profiteers, and if another group of profiteering youth is produced, how can society be improved in the future? What hope can the nation have for them?

Therefore, we hope that the spirit of young students will be invigorated.

### Forced into a Chartered Car

— Lin

A thought-provoking record appeared in a student's diary.

Below is a passage from the original text:

"Because I often walk home, the rickshaw puller goes back with an empty car. My mother often scolds me and the rickshaw puller, named Er'a, for this. Yesterday, after evening school, Er'a grabbed me and dragged me into the car and ran off... The school is not very far away, and many classmates walk home. Why do I always have to take a car!" (Original text unchanged)

I see the image of a pure and innocent child flickering before my eyes. He is good, he does not want to be more comfortable than others, he enjoys walking with his companions, living a normal life, he does not want to be a young master or young lady.

But some people are determined to destroy those sacred souls, not only to degenerate their feet, turning them into mere decorations wearing silk stockings and leather shoes, but also to deprive them of their noble will, using a comfortable life to create gentlemen and ladies.

To be "forced" to "take a chartered car" implies a degree of suffering that can be imagined, but fortunately, there are still children in China who are willing to be with the masses and unwilling to sit alone in a chartered car, because this is what modern China needs in its citizens.

### Grain as Big as Chicken Eggs

— Translated by Cansheng

One day, some children found a kind of grain in a valley with a groove in the middle, but it was as big as a chicken egg.

A traveler happened to pass by and bought it from the children for a penny, and immediately presented it to the emperor as a rare treasure.

The emperor summoned all the scholars under him and asked them to investigate what it was.

The scholars considered it again and again, but they could not identify it.

Until one day, when it was placed on a windowsill, a chicken flew up and pecked a hole in it; then people knew it was a grain of rice.

The emperor was very surprised and ordered all the scholars to investigate when and where this kind of grain grew.

The students reconsidered and reconsidered, and searched all their books, but still found nothing.

Therefore, they reported to the emperor: "We cannot give you an answer; our books do not say anything about it either, but you can ask the farmers, perhaps some of them have heard from their ancestors when and where this kind of grain grew."

So the emperor issued an order to summon the oldest farmer to see him.

His ministers found such a person; it was a bent old man, his face as gray as bloodless, his teeth missing, and he could barely shuffle to the emperor with the help of two canes.

The emperor showed him the grain, but the old man's eyes were not good either, so he could only hold it in his hands and stroke it to substitute for his observation.

The emperor asked: "Can you tell me, old man, where this kind of grain grows? Have you ever bought this kind of grain or planted it in your fields?"

The old man was so deaf that he could not even understand what the emperor was saying, and with great difficulty, he could only understand some of it.

"No!" he finally replied: "I have never planted it, nor have I harvested any grain like this, nor have I ever bought it in my fields. When I bought grain, the grain was as small as it is now, but you can ask my father, he may have heard where this kind of grain grows."

So the emperor summoned the old man's father, and he was found and came before the emperor.

He walked with one cane; he carefully observed the grain for a while with silent, yet seemingly practiced eyes.

Then the emperor asked him: "Can you tell me, old man, where this kind of grain grows? Have you ever bought or planted this kind of grain in your fields?"

"No!" he said: "I have never planted or harvested such grain in my fields; as for buying it? I have never bought anything, because in my time, money was not yet used, everyone planted their own grain, and when there was any need, we could share a portion with others to enjoy together."

"I don't know where grain grows like this; our grain is bigger and produces more flour than it does now; but I have never seen anything like this... Oh! I once heard my father say that in his time, the grain grew bigger, and the flour produced was more than in our time; so you better ask him!"

Therefore, the emperor summoned the old man's father again, and still found him, he did not use a cane, and walked in calmly; his eyes were sharp, his hearing was very good, and his speech was very clear.

The emperor showed him the grain, and the great-grandfather looked at it, and rubbed it with his hands.

"It's been a long time since I've seen such good grain," he said, and then bit off a piece to taste. "That's right, it's this kind," he added.

"Tell me, Grandpa," said the emperor: "When and where does this kind of grain grow? Have you ever bought any like this or planted it in your fields?"

The old man replied: "In my time, this kind of grain grew everywhere. We lived by planting, harvesting, and threshing this kind of grain from the stalks."

Then the emperor asked: "Tell me, Grandpa! Have you ever bought it? Anywhere? Or have you grown it yourself?"

The old man smiled, "In my time," he replied: "We didn't know what money was? Everyone had their own grain."

"Now tell me, Grandpa!" the emperor asked: "Where are your fields, where do your fields grow this kind of grain?"

The great-grandfather replied: "My field is the land of nature; anywhere, as long as I cultivate it, it becomes my field." "The land is free, and no one says that anything is their own."

"Answer me two or three questions," said the emperor: "First, why did the land grow such grain, and now it has stopped? The second question is: Why does your grandson walk with two canes, your son with one, and you do not use one at all? Your eyes are clear, your teeth are sound, your speech is fluent and pleasing to the ear, how did all these phenomena happen?"

The old man replied: "It is like this, because people have stopped relying on their own labor to survive, and love to rely on the labor of others. In ancient times, people lived according to the laws of nature; they labored with their own muscles and bones, and did not covet the production of others." (Original by Tolstoy)

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Madam Ye the Second gave many reasons to stop Cui Zhen from going to Shanghai, but Cui Zhen was still unwilling to give up. Only one reason, regarding the Wei family's matter, is that they are still investigating who killed Wei Shaoyun. You are a person involved in the case, how can you go out and show your face. This sentence was almost a direct hit. Only then did Cui Zhen abandon the idea of going to Shanghai. Madam Ye the Second told Wei Cheng, and Wei Cheng smiled and said, "She is not so anxious to treat her own feet, but eager to find Chen Guofang. I really admire her great spirit."

This day was December 27th, and the Ye family really didn't have any special actions. In the afternoon, Madam Ye the Second let Ah Xing and He Zixing go to Huagang to buy fish, meat, and vegetables, and also instructed, "If anyone asks, don't say that it is the first anniversary of our madam's death. According to the customs of the countryside, when they hear that someone has something going on, they have to send gifts. We are not prepared and dare not accept gifts from others." Both Ah Xing and He Zixing obeyed her orders. Upon returning from Huagang, they quietly sent the fish, meat, and vegetables into the kitchen. Madam Ye the Second sent Ah Xing and Xu Quanfu to help He Ma wash and cook the vegetables. The kitchen was very lively. Wei Cheng felt a pang of sadness in his heart. He left Cui Zhen and Huang Long behind and walked to the Shuangmei Study. A Samsung safety lamp was hung on the two beams. The light was dim, illuminating everything still on the four walls. Wei Cheng looked up at the portraits of his parents, thinking that tomorrow he would have to take the portraits down and place them in the Side Hall, so tonight he should wipe the frames and glass clean first. He walked step by step towards the portraits, and unintentionally and reverently bowed. He looked up again, seeing that his father's face was full of life, but his mother's face was frowning. Thinking about why his mother was frowning, he couldn't help but feel a burst of sadness, and tears streamed down his face. He felt as if a stone was pressing on his heart, causing a dull pain. Wiping away his tears, he used both hands to take down his mother's portrait and placed it on the table. (219)
