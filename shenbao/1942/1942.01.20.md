Tokyo, 19th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese mechanized units in Malaya have advanced to within 25 miles of Singapore, encircling 20,000 British troops in the Johore Bahru area. Simultaneously, they are increasing pressure on Singapore from the northwest. Since the Japanese forces outflanked the rear positions of the British troops near Johore Bahru, the state of Johore has been isolated, with railway and highway communications to Singapore completely cut off. Japanese forces on the west coast, after occupying Pontian Besar (25 miles west of Johore Bahru), are engaged in fierce fighting with British troops on the central highway, approximately 25 miles from Singapore.

### British Cabinet Unlikely to Change, Special Meeting to Be Convened Soon, Churchill and Cabinet Members Are Holding Important Discussions, Reorganization of Specialized and Advisory Departments Is Expected

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Havas) - Correspondents from London are reporting on the British situation, all saying that there is unlikely to be a cabinet reshuffle in Britain. Prime Minister Churchill's position is as stable as a rock. The return of Minister of Supply Beaverbrook is especially clear evidence that there will be no change in Britain's war economy policy. It is also speculated that Sir Stafford Cripps, the recently recalled ambassador to the Soviet Union, is likely to join the cabinet.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haito News Agency) - British radio stated yesterday that after British Prime Minister Churchill returned to London on Saturday, the British Cabinet convened a special meeting. Churchill reported on his trip to the United States and stated that he and President Roosevelt had drafted a detailed plan for Allied operations.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haito News Agency) - According to recent opinions in London, although the British Cabinet may be changed after Churchill's return to England, because Beaverbrook accompanied Churchill on his return, London's insistence on an urgent change of the cabinet is not as strong as before. Informed sources previously believed that Beaverbrook will remain in Washington as the British representative in the war supplies section of the Allied War Committee. The vacancy for the British Minister of Supply will be filled by another member of the British Cabinet. According to a Swedish correspondent in London, some political figures in London observe that the British Cabinet will not be changed. The whereabouts of Cripps are still under consideration. His news of passing through India on his way back to the country has attracted attention from all parties. If Churchill does not agree to India's demands, Cripps may not join Churchill's wartime cabinet. It should be remembered that Churchill is the strongest opponent of India's constitutionalism. Informed sources in London stated that the British condemnation of improper preparations in Malaya is still high. Even the House of Commons has debated this issue for two days. The attacks on Churchill in previous parliaments have not been so fierce. If these criticisms do not stop, Churchill will raise the question of confidence in Parliament. The London correspondent of the "Daily News" stated that the following questions will be discussed in the British House of Commons: The issue of managing the production of war equipment; The issue of the Dominions participating in the war; The issue of reorganizing the administrative aspects of the wartime cabinet; The issue of the relationship between the wartime cabinet and the ministers directly responsible for the war. Regarding the issue of the Dominions participating in the war, including Australia's dissatisfaction with Britain's East Asian war plan, will be discussed in detail in the House of Commons in order to resolve it.

London, 19th (Reuters) - Prime Minister Churchill returned home from the United States by plane, personally piloting the plane midway, earning the nickname "Flying Prime Minister". Upon returning to London, he immediately held successive consultations with key members of the wartime cabinet and important advisors, which continued until late Saturday night and all day Sunday, and have not yet ended. It is reported that the immediate task is to reorganize the specialized and advisory departments of the government in order to adapt to the new plan for unified military organization of the Allies. Several senior officials from the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Supply, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be dispatched to foreign countries immediately so that the work started in Washington can be implemented quickly.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haito News Agency) - London will convene a meeting at the end of this month to discuss the training of air force personnel. The British Air Ministry, which is hosting the meeting, announced that representatives from various British dominions and representatives from the U.S. Air Force will attend this meeting.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haito News Agency) - Reports from London yesterday stated that if the British Parliament does not immediately discuss the East Asian situation when it convenes, Liberal MP Granville intends to propose a motion to adjourn to the House of Commons. It is said that the positions of Singapore and Australia are now precarious, and the communication lines and the Empire itself have been subjected to extremely serious danger. Therefore, for the sake of the future of the country, these issues should be discussed frankly and quickly. In addition, there is a lack of official information released, which has prevented the British and Australian people from fully understanding the extent to which the East Asian war has progressed. This point should also be raised for discussion.

### Malayan Local Customs

In terms of housing, Malays, except for old-fashioned buildings which are still common in old cities, nearly all buildings in newly emerging cities in the past century are completely Europeanized, and the life of citizens is also becoming increasingly modernized. Only those called "Kampongs" in the Malay language, which means "villages," still retain the original appearance of rural life. The houses are built with wooden frames and topped with attap leaves, so there are louvered window frames and small ladders in front of the doors for getting up and down. These half-storied wooden houses are scattered among coconut groves. (Top picture) is a Malay family, and its background is the house of this kind of "Kampong". (Bottom picture) is a scene of Malay scholars planting rice. Malay agriculture can be divided into three categories: the first is rubber, coconut, rice, oil palm, and pineapple; the second is intermediate crops, such as coffee, tea, tapioca flour, gambier, tobacco, bananas, and other miscellaneous fruits; and the third is spices, textile plants, medicinal materials, etc.

### A Brief History of German Paratroopers (7)

Compared to American parachutes, German parachutes appear to be smaller in diameter and slightly deeper at the top. They also have a secret design called "air rudders" that can accurately control direction and also slow or accelerate descent. During landing, soldiers in the same team try to reunite in one place, so when they hit the ground they have formed a group and can move quickly. However, it is not advisable to cluster too closely in the air, giving enemy gunners an opportunity to attack. A paratrooper suspended in the air seems like a good target, but this is not the case, because he swings from side to side and falls rapidly, and can also defend himself by shooting. On average, he stays in the air for no more than fifteen seconds. When fighting, the lower the altitude when jumping from the plane, the better, from 150 feet to 1,000 feet. If it is necessary to jump from above 1,000 feet due to environmental needs, it is not advisable to launch an attack.

Each paratrooper is also equipped with a gas mask, an automatic pistol, several hand grenades in rubber bags, and a portion of emergency food, which contains bread that does not spoil and several vitamin pills called "Baimiding", which can increase blood pressure after taking it, making people forget fatigue.

Every airborne division has a complete health or medical team, whose structure is similar to that of an army division, including doctors of various departments, paramedics, and stretcher-bearers, who parachute down with the division. However, the doctors carry not weapons but sets of medicines and surgical instruments, including scalpels, morphine, hemostats, and various stimulants. Paramedics carry stretchers and first-aid kits. The remaining medical supplies are packed in padded boxes and dropped from the plane. The packages are marked with red crosses. Other sanitary equipment, which is commonly available in the army, is brought by subsequent transport aircraft.

### The Japanese Authorities Announced Yesterday: Measures for Handling Confiscated Goods; Buying, Selling, and Transferring Prohibited from Today; Special Handling for Those with Essential Living Needs

Regarding the handling of goods, the Japanese Army and Navy jointly issued the following statement yesterday: The Japanese Imperial Army and Navy authorities hope to quickly open all currently seized warehouses to restore economic activity in Shanghai and stabilize the lives of the people. Therefore, from January 15th of this year, they will implement measures for handling materials in the Shanghai area. That is, the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy, regarding materials listed in the attached schedule that can be directly or indirectly used as military supplies, will consider the general welfare of the people while determining whether the owner is an enemy national. Then, in accordance with international law, they will confiscate, detain, requisition, or purchase the minimum quantity of needed goods. However, the Japanese Army and Navy will not directly consult on the minimum necessary quantity of goods or materials other than those listed in the attached schedule. Regardless of whether the materials listed in the attached schedule were declared based on the "Important Goods Declaration Announcement" of December 17th of last year or are stored in currently sealed warehouses, from the 20th of this month until the date of the next announcement (this period is approximately four weeks), all buying, selling, transferring of ownership, or establishing pledges, mortgages, or any other transfer or change of rights, as well as actions changing the location, are prohibited, except for personal use. However, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities hope that the general public residing in the Shanghai area will clearly understand that this prohibition is an absolutely necessary measure to smoothly and quickly handle materials, and will endure the temporary inconvenience, providing full assistance to the Japanese side. If citizens have absolutely indispensable reasons for their daily lives and hope that the authorities will grant special handling, they can promptly submit a detailed explanation to the Economic Section of the Japanese Military Police in the Audemars Building (or have it forwarded through the Municipal Council) to apply for special handling. This application form can be obtained from the aforementioned agency. If the Japanese military authorities, after reviewing the application, deem the reason sufficient, they may approve exceptional handling. However, anyone who violates this prohibition without following this procedure will be severely punished without leniency. Furthermore, this prohibition applies equally to any group, company, or individual, regardless of nationality.

### Financial Stability, Ample Credit; Withdrawal Restrictions to be Lifted; Drafts at Full Value, No Discount Needed

After the promulgation of the Interim Measures for the Operation of Silver and Money Businesses, all firms and banks have complied. For demand deposits made before December 8th, the regulations stipulated that 500 yuan in cash could be withdrawn every three days, with any excess paid in the form of payment drafts. However, depositors after the 8th, whether newly opened or continued accounts, are not subject to the interim measures. Since implementation, the wave of withdrawals has subsided, the overall financial situation has stabilized, and credit is gradually becoming more abundant. It is heard that firms and banks are providing special accommodations for depositors' withdrawals, issuing drafts as much as possible. Term depositors are permitted to mortgage their accounts for half their value, but not exceeding 1,000 yuan per account. Staggered reserves can also be telegraphed and withdrawn without interest. Businesses and companies are being accommodated in disbursing employee salaries, and these payment drafts are equivalent to cash, with no discount needed on the market. Although some may charge handling fees, the amount is very small. As for the deposits of Chinese firms and banks in British and American banks, they have been transferred and used by the Yokohama Specie Bank. The authorities have completed the clearing of British, American, and Dutch banks and have allowed them to resume operations. A satisfactory solution has also been negotiated for the problems of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and National Industrial Bank of China. Therefore, it is heard that the withdrawal restriction measures will be lifted after the end of the general accounting period for various industries.

### Allied Banks Begin Second Withdrawal; Chase Bank Still Not Paying; Banque Franco-Chinoise and Sassoon Continue to Remain Closed

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that seven Shanghai branches of Allied banks began paying out the second batch of deposits to individual depositors this morning (the 19th). However, the percentage of the payout, determined last week by the Japanese liquidators of each bank, varies. The number of Allied banks in the city that have paid out the second batch of deposits has thus increased to eight: HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, China and London, Citibank, American Express, two Dutch banks, and one Belgian bank. The percentage of the payout for the second batch of deposits ranges from 10% to 50%.

Withdrawal Procedures Handled Quickly

This morning, depositors at these banks did not seem to be in a great rush to withdraw the second batch of deposits, so there were no scenes of long queues or rushes at the banks. The amount that depositors were allowed to withdraw had been pre-marked by the Japanese liquidators, so the payment was quite simple. Only depositors who are not nationals of countries at war with Japan are allowed to withdraw 10% to 50% of their deposits and receive large sums of cash. British, American, Dutch, and Belgian residents are still subject to the limit of no more than 2,000 yuan per month for withdrawals. Chinese deposits exceeding 10,000 yuan are still frozen, pending the Japanese decision on how to dispose of them. This morning, Chase Bank was still not allowed to pay out the second batch of deposits, but depositors who had not withdrawn the full 2,000 yuan of the first batch of deposits since December 6th of last year were still paid to make up the 2,000 yuan. Other Allied banks, such as Banque Franco-Chinoise and Sassoon, remained closed today and were not allowed to pay out the first batch of deposits. These banks will continue to remain closed until the Japanese liquidators issue further announcements.

Further Plans After Second Withdrawal Completed

After the aforementioned eight Allied banks complete the second batch of deposit payouts, the remaining amount will temporarily remain in those Allied banks. However, whether these remaining deposits will be paid out in the future will depend on the amount of cash that each bank can raise. This morning, the foreign exchange market was relatively firm. Exchange shops in the central district exchanged US$1 for 16 yuan to 16.10 yuan in legal tender and indicated that they would raise the exchange rate for large sums of US dollars. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate rose to 2.60 yuan, an increase of 30 cents compared to 2.30 yuan last Saturday. Japanese military notes remained at the semi-official exchange rate of about 4 yuan in legal tender for one military note, with no change and very little trading.

### Consular Body to Pass "No Gratuities for Renting Houses" Today; Most Consuls Have Replied Approving

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the practice of collecting "small rent" when renting houses in the city is about to be eradicated by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The new by-law attached to the land regulations, which prohibits the collection of "small rent," is expected to receive the final approval of the Consular Body tomorrow (the 20th). According to an official, the new by-law can be said to have already passed, as most consuls have replied stating their approval. Only the replies of a few consuls are currently awaited, but this is merely a formality, as the remaining few consuls will certainly approve it as well. It is expected that the Shanghai Municipal Council will announce it immediately after receiving the official approval of the Consular Body. This time, the Consular Body is well aware that the prohibition of collecting "small rent" is a matter of great urgency, so it has studied the new by-law very quickly. In the past, it would have taken much longer to study such a complex issue.

### Jingye Orphanage Confectionery Inexpensive Tailoring Services

### National Rice Prices Fall

The rice market fell again yesterday due to increasing supply and declining market sentiment. Shops in this street needed rice, but there was no food. Although it was not easy for food households to buy foreign rice, many shifted their attention to national rice. However, there were purchases from door-to-door sales and direct allocation of goods, and not all were inquired about in the market. Therefore, although the digestion of each household was active, the total turnover was only about 300 bags. Early and late rice from the Southern Gang fell by 5, 6, and 7 yuan, respectively, and the Northern Gang also fell by 3 or 4 yuan. Early rice opened at 200 yuan, then 197 yuan, and then 195 yuan. Late rice was 198 yuan to 196 yuan, again approaching the 201 yuan mark. Top-quality Northern Japonica rice still needed 228 yuan to 226 yuan, and second-quality rice was 220 yuan, because the arrival was small and the digestion was still continuous. Yin Yuan and Du Jian had no arrivals, it is said.

The demand for foreign rice is still difficult to meet. Although the number of rice received must be disclosed, only one rice store near Route Picard-Destelan and Route Petain was seen to be able to handle it in accordance with the regulations. The rest were not seen.

### Stocks of Miscellaneous Grains Gradually Run Thin

The Shanghai Rice, Wheat, Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cake Association convened a general meeting of the rice, wheat, oil cake, and miscellaneous grains groups yesterday afternoon at the miscellaneous grains market. A large number of people attended. Chairman Yang Heqing reported on the internal organization and revised the regulations, which were discussed for a long time. It is heard that they have recently contacted the Japanese side to handle grain transportation and sales in order to restore the business of the industry.

As for the miscellaneous grains market yesterday, there was only half a day of trading in the morning. Each commodity was still popular due to the supply shortage. Soybean oil prices both rose by one or two yuan, and corn prices were firm. The market conditions are recorded separately below.

The stock of cooking oil in the market is dwindling daily, and there are few sellers. Yesterday, stores on this street added 300 dan of Qing oil from the Da You Factory. The July warehouse receipt was 295 yuan, the August warehouse receipt was 296 yuan, and the September warehouse receipt was 298 yuan, an increase of one or two yuan compared to before.

Both the arrival and stock of soybeans are lacking, and the price has continued to rise. Yesterday, nearly 100 bags of Tianjin Jin Yuan were handled by stores on this street, and the price reached a new high of 120 yuan. Qing beans were 40 yuan, and the price was 117 yuan. Jiaozhou aged yellow beans were 50 yuan, and the price was 111.5 yuan. Pinghu Du beans were 20 bags, and the price was 123 yuan, up about a yuan compared to before. Adzuki beans are also trending upwards due to the scarcity of goods. Yesterday, more than ten bags of Kaiben semi-adzuki beans were sold, and the price was 79 yuan.

The supply and demand of corn were balanced yesterday. Cargo owners continued to firmly intend to sell, but actual sales households only slightly selected what they needed. Therefore, the market was firm. Hebei white corn opened at 200 bags, and the price was 52 yuan to 51.5 yuan. Saigon aged corn was 100 bags, and the price was 51 yuan. New corn was 300 bags, with the East Warehouse price at 57.5 yuan and the West Warehouse price at 57 yuan. Yinhua Company was 50 tons, and the price was 86 yuan. There was still Huangdu corn yelling 60 yuan.

The market, because the arrival of customers and goods was scarce for a long time, and the sales channels in the interior are already moving, the price is also increasing step by step. Especially the quotations in the Wuxi area are showing prices, so the demand in the interior has turned strong yesterday. Sanxin small packages immediately opened at 55 yuan to 55.5 yuan with commission, and more than 2,000 bags were traded. Later, because the customer appetite did not decline, the cargo owners were unwilling to let go easily, and the evening market call price reached 56 yuan, it is said.

### Cash Prices Surge

Cash: The dull market opened with rising prices. Continuing the upward momentum from the previous weekend, everyone was already optimistic. Gold shops and jewelers were scouring for supplies, leading to diminishing reserves and prices approaching the 12,000-yuan mark. The opening price was already 200 yuan higher at 11,550 yuan. At this price, Tong Kangyong exclusively sold 90 taels to Xinyuan, a certain gold shop, and Fang Jiuxia, among others. Subsequently, there was a transaction at 11,500 yuan for 10 taels. Gold shops and jewelers continued to aggressively buy. Although Tong Kangyong sold over 400 taels, Gong He then aggressively bought over 300 taels, pushing the price up 250 yuan to 11,750 yuan. At that time, Tianjin merchants were selling, pushing the price back down to 11,550 yuan. Chaozhou's Xiang Xingyong also sold. Gong He and Tiancheng gold shops, along with jewelers, continuously pushed the price up, eventually rising over 400 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 20 taels to a broker representing a previous generation of Cantonese merchants at a price of 11,960 yuan. Tong Kangyong continued to sell, and Fang Jiuxia also sold again. The price slightly decreased at noon, settling at 11,800 yuan, a 450 yuan increase compared to the closing price of the previous Saturday. The price difference for the day was 460 yuan. About 2,400 to 2,500 taels were traded in four transactions, indicating a strong market.

Jewelry Gold: The selling price per tael at Daxin and other shops increased by 50 yuan after 10 o'clock, reaching 1,250 yuan (buying price decreased by 150 yuan). Refined silver remained at 16 yuan. There were transactions in the black market at 11.5 yuan, but fewer sellers were reported afterwards.

Discount Rate for Drafts and Notes: Remained unchanged at par per thousand yuan. The interbank lending rate announced by the Bankers Association also remained at six percent.

The exchange rates for British and American gold pounds both rose by 10 yuan, with the former at 275 yuan and the latter at 280 yuan. American dollar notes also rose to 16.10 yuan. Hong Kong dollar notes were at 2.65 yuan and 2.20 yuan. Military notes were at 3.94 yuan.

### Scattered Cotton Yarn Transactions Still Fairly Good

The cotton yarn market is trending upward, due to renewed excitement among buyers. Furthermore, scattered spot transactions are still fairly good, which boosted confidence. 20-count Shuang Ma (Double Horse) brand single yarn opened at 1,800 yuan, up 40 yuan. Subsequently, with eager buyers, the situation progressed to 1,840 yuan. However, some profit-takers suddenly sold, pushing the price back down to 1,805 yuan. Finally, the market improved again to close at 1,840 yuan. 42-count Lan Feng (Blue Phoenix): 4,020 yuan to 4,050 yuan. 42-count Li Ma (Standing Horse): 4,050 yuan. 42-count Xian Tao (Fairy Peach): 4,030 yuan. 20-count Yue Qin (Moon Zither): 2,210 yuan to 2,190 yuan. 20-count Shui Yue (Water Moon): 2,460 yuan. 20-count Hong Xi (Great Happiness): 2,240 yuan. 20-count Hong Kui Xing (Red Chief Star): 2,160 yuan. 20-count Xian He (Fairy Crane): 2,270 yuan. 20-count Shuang Ma (Double Horse) spot: 2,100 yuan to 2,090 yuan. 20-count Tian Nv (Celestial Maiden): 2,450 yuan to 2,485 yuan. 20-count Shuang Di Qiu (Double Earth): 1,900 yuan. 16-count Fei Ji (Airplane): 1,880 yuan. 40-count Jin Hu (Golden Tiger): 3,580 yuan. 32-count Jin Hu (Golden Tiger): 3,240 yuan. 6-count Yanzhi Hu (Rouge Tiger): 1,750 yuan. 16-count Jin Qiao (Golden Bridge): 1,980 yuan. 6-count Hong Da Xi (Great Red Happiness): 1,825 yuan.

### Blue Cloth and Fine Cloth Best for Sales to Customers

Factory Cloth: The market is still active due to genuine local demand. Spot goods remain scarce. Selling prices for various cloths remain firm. 16-pound Hua Die (Flower Butterfly) coarse cloth is quoted at 116 yuan. 13-pound Yih Ho Fei Xiong (Ewo Flying Bear) coarse cloth: 88 yuan. 11-pound San Mao Ba Shi (Three Cats Eighty): 80 yuan. 9-pound Wu Fu Mao Ying (Five Blessings Cat Eagle): 70 yuan. Generally, there were no major gains or losses. However, blue cloth and fine cloth continue to sell well to customers, and prices have increased by 2 to 3 yuan per bolt. About 300 pieces of various goods were traded in the local and Ningbo markets.

Eastern Cloth: The previous gains were sustained. The market for fine cloth is firm. Longtou (Dragon Head) fine cloth opened at 89.50 yuan in the morning and closed at 88.75 yuan at noon.

Wu Fu Shuang Yu (Five Blessings Double Fish): 84.50 yuan. The market for Si Junzi (Four Gentlemen) drill serge (Pique) orders weakened due to pressure from the factories to ship goods. The evening closing price was 3.06 yuan, a decrease of 2 fen. However, spot drill serge was scarce and rose by 2.5 fen, closing at 3.055 yuan.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Recently, the sugar market has seen continued upward movement of over 20 yuan due to a persistent lack of supply and unavailable foreign stocks. 24-degree coarse white sugar is at 270 yuan. Dutch red sugar is at 285 yuan. Zhen Ji No. 1 white sugar is at 280 yuan. No. 1 ice sugar is at 337 yuan. Taikoo white sugar is relatively cheaper: B grade is at 282 yuan. DY grade is at 278 yuan.

### Government Bonds Rebound, Foreign Stocks Mostly Down

Government Bond Grey Market Trading: Government bonds rebounded hesitantly in the morning, falling sharply by 1.50 to 2.01 yuan. Previous rumors that E-type bonds would be re-drawn in Chongqing have remained unconfirmed. Bondholders are suddenly suspicious, and the person responsible for the bonds remains unknown. Speculators are anxious and are selling off their positions, causing market prices to decline sharply. A-type bonds suddenly broke through the 70-yuan mark. After this blow, unless there is officially good news, it will be difficult to see the previous highs again. Trading volume in the market was not high, with only Dahua, Hengxing, and Shunheng selling, while Quangong, Yuxing, Dingkang, and Tongkang all bought. However, the downward trend of market prices did not waver. A-type bonds opened at 70 yuan and fell to 69.60 yuan. B-type bonds were only traded at 66.20 yuan and 66.10 yuan. C-type bonds broke through 66 yuan at the opening and continued to fall, breaking through the 65-yuan mark to 64.60 yuan. D-type bonds were only traded at 62.30 yuan and closed at only 61.80 yuan. E-type bonds fell from 64.20 yuan to 62.90 yuan. The transaction volume was about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the number of operators dealing in foreign stocks outside the Public Securities Exchange continued to increase, but market prices still followed those set within the exchange. Trading activity increased, but market prices mostly declined, showing a situation of oversupply. The closing prices were as follows: Wheelock Marden: 57.50 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mill: 24 yuan. Shanghai Bank: 10.20 yuan. China Merchants: 11 yuan. Yangtze: 10.07 yuan. British-American Tobacco: 17.90 yuan. Asia Navigation: 8 yuan. Telephone: 22 yuan. Ewo Brewery: 5.20 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### Unveiling the Mystery of Bai Yushuang's Life and Death

‚Äî Taixu

Hospitalized for illness for over a month, surgery has passed the danger period.

Bai Yushuang, who was expelled from Beijing by Yuan Liang for "immorality," not only became a sensation in Shanghai, but also laid the foundation for this "niche drama," Beng Beng Opera, in the South. Later, the rise of Xi Cailian, Zhu Baoxia, Zhu Zixia, and others can be said to have benefited from Bai Yushuang's "legacy." Didn't you see the grandeur of the Empire Theater back then? It was truly "the widow opening a shop astonished everyone, the execution of the old woman brought high praise!" The resounding fame of Bai Yushuang's name was only comparable to Chen Yunshang's "Mulan Joins the Army." However, our Boss Bai, while enjoying immense popularity, also staged a wonderful comedy "underneath the surface" ‚Äì "The Elopement with a Drummer." Driven by affection, she disregarded everything. Her departure made it difficult for the Empire Theater to continue its business. Later generations wrote a poem to record this event: "The entire troupe cannot compare to one Yushuang!" Just like when Ruan Lingyu died, there was a sincere eulogy saying "Half of China's movie actresses have died," Bai Yushuang's memory has indeed left an indelible mark in the minds of Shanghainese!

Naturally, the Empire Theater authorities would try to track down Bai Yushuang, who had not fulfilled her contract. After negotiations, Bai Yushuang promised that if she were to return to Shanghai, she would first fulfill the uncompleted contract. Nine years have passed since then.

During these nine years, the touching stories of Bai Yushuang on and off stage in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places have occasionally reached the ears of Shanghainese. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of this month, someone named "Weiwo" reported that our Beng Beng Queen had unfortunately passed away.

It is true that Bai Yushuang is ill, and it is also true that she is seriously ill. However, just the day before the "news report" ‚Äì the 7th, the Empire Theater received a telegram from Beijing stating: "Zhang (Weitao) of the Empire Theater, Bai's illness has not healed, will not come to Shanghai for the time being." Since the spring of this year, the Empire Theater authorities have contacted Bai Ling several times, hoping that Bai Yushuang could come to Shanghai again during the Lunar New Year. Perhaps Bai Yushuang also wanted to "adjust her lineup," and both parties had reached an agreement. Unfortunately, Bai Yushuang suddenly contracted an "ailment of love" that could only be cured with surgery. The telegram on the "7th" was sent after she had the operation.

After this "shocking news" was announced in Shanghai, the discussions among "Bai fans" were expected. However, the Empire Theater authorities were confused. Mr. Zhang Weitao immediately sent Mr. Xie Guangsheng to Beijing to visit Bai. Yesterday morning, he received a letter from Tianjin dated January 15th (one week after the "passing"):

Mr. Weitao:

Mr. Xie Guangsheng, whom I sent to Tianjin, has formally met several times. Because Actress Bai is ill and hospitalized in the German Hospital in Beijing, she has been there for over a month. I went to Beijing to visit her again, but she has not yet been discharged from the hospital. The matter of going to Shanghai will be decided at a later date. Mr. Xie has returned to Shanghai and will surely report. No further details, and best regards.

Sincerely, Caiting

The special envoy Mr. Xie Guangsheng and the express mail arrived in Shanghai on the same day. His "report" is: Bai Yushuang has passed the danger period, but whether she will come to Shanghai this year is, as the letter says, "to be decided at a later date."

Bai Yushuang has not died, and she will definitely come to Shanghai next spring (this is what Mr. Zhang Weitao told me when I was leaving). This sensational "Bai case" can now come to an end. (Copper Coin for Bai Yushuang's "Su San")

Editor's Note: Mr. "Weiwo" is a special correspondent for the entertainment industry and recently returned from Beijing. Therefore, after Spring and Autumn was changed to a combined publication, when the entertainment editor handed me this "exclusive report," I sent it out with deep conviction. The sin of negligence cannot be excused, but I dare not bear the responsibility of spreading rumors. Yesterday, I specially invited Mr. Taixu to visit Mr. Zhang Weitao, manager of the Empire Theater, to obtain the results and make a correction on behalf of Mr. "Weiwo"!)

### A Record of Mending Torn Banknotes

‚Äî Wu Han

I haven't had many personal experiences with the market rejecting torn banknotes. This is because I don't handle much cash.

Yesterday, I had a "Jiaotong" ten-yuan note. Although the color was not vibrant, the appearance was still decent. The front featured the Jianghai Customs Building, and the back depicted a ship and a train with clear patterns, making it quite enjoyable to admire. This type of note, which is used frequently, is never kept "in stock" in my humble "small shop," so it was used to buy rice soon after I received it. The purpose was very legitimate, one might say.

Who knew that the servant would return empty-handed with the original note. Without asking for details, it was obvious that it was a "rejected note."

I couldn't help but be taken aback. I had to use a scientific method to carefully examine the banknote. Fortunately, I had tools like a ruler and a pencil on hand, so I became a forensic doctor in a court of law, examining the "injury" and filling out a report.

I verified that this banknote was issued in the third year of the Republic, with the numbers three and six at the beginning and end of the serial number. The patterns and colors were beyond reproach. The entire banknote was three and three-eighths inches high and six and one-eighth inches wide. The "injury" was on the left side, a straight diagonal tear measuring five and a half inches. Both the top and bottom were patched with white paper, but the paper had already cracked due to frequent handling. The examination revealed only old injuries, no new ones. However, this five-eighths inch long crack was a "fatal" wound.

Speechless before the banknote, I had no choice but to be compassionate and do some repair work. So I found some glue and "edge tape" and carefully measured the length of the "wound," treating it like a patient, and used a protective heart to carry out the "note repair" work. After finishing, I looked at it and was quite satisfied.

Clutching this ten-yuan note, which I considered expertly repaired, I went to the office and asked the accounting director to exchange it at the bank. But after a while, the old cashier returned and said that the bank teller would not accept it and there was nothing he could do.

I couldn't help but be suspicious. If a note that was a quarter torn was still usable, then this full banknote had a total area of 2013 square inches, and the tear was only a few eighths of an inch long. Moreover, I carefully patched the old wound. Why couldn't it be used?

A wasted effort, that was my final conclusion.

Xi Xiaobo and Hou Yulan are scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow after their performance at the Golden Theater and will travel to Sichuan for a half-month performance before returning north.

Previously, there was news that the Carlton Theater had invited Wu Suqiu to Shanghai. It is now reported that Wu refused due to demanding too high a fee. Recently, there has also been talk of the Shanghai Theater School performing at the theater at night starting from the Lunar New Year. Both parties are currently in negotiations.

Gai Jiaotian's contract at the Golden Theater is valid until the end of the year. Xin Zheng Shan Qilintong will take over after the New Year.

### Full-Day vs. Half-Day School

‚Äî Zai

For the past four or five years, due to insufficient classrooms, many schools have switched from full-day to half-day classes. Naturally, this has some impact on academics, but it is a solution in these times of expensive rice and fuel.

Students in schools with full-day classes usually eat out at restaurants or buy bread at snack shops for lunch due to insufficient travel time. However, recently, both restaurant meals and bread have become increasingly expensive due to the "rice and flour shortage." This is a major blow to poor students who attend full-day classes. If we can go home for meals, the money spent can be reduced considerably, but there is absolutely no time to make it to the first class; if we eat out, it is economically impossible. This problem puts us in a dilemma, and some may even have to drop out of school as a result.

Many have suggested changing class times to 7:30 AM to 12:30 PM. If the break time is further reduced, the entire curriculum can be completed in five hours without any problems, just like half-day schools. Others have suggested extending lunchtime to 2:00 PM, which is also a solution.

In short, we hope to be able to go home for meals to alleviate our current difficulties.

Sixteen: The Flame of Youth

"No, she hasn't even told me a joke in the past half-month," Shao Hua said sincerely, wiping away the tears from his face with a handkerchief.

"She hasn't even told you a joke and you've already spent so much money on her. If she were to get any closer to you, what would happen then?" Xiang Qi leaned against the back of a swivel chair that Shao Hua had been sitting on and sneered a few times.

"No, Aunt, don't misunderstand. I voluntarily gave her all this money!" Shao Hua said hastily. "It's because her father is very ill."

Xiang Qi still looked unconvinced, sneering slightly.

"And she always tries her best to refuse. I always have to give it to one of her cousins or her uncle first, and then they give it to her," Shao Hua said seriously. Anyone who saw him would immediately believe that he was telling the truth.

"Does a singing girl like that have so many people following her?" Xiang Qi asked curiously.

"There are four of them in total, two old and two young. But I only saw that ugly old man who plays the Jinghu once. I heard that he was sick later. From the second time onward, the old man who originally played the Erhu filled in. According to him, their surname is Han and they are from Shandong. The taller girl is his daughter, and the other is his niece, who is even younger. She sings even better than the older one, and she is also very chaste and quiet, never saying a word lightly. She is very beautiful, and I heard that she has even studied‚Äî" Shao Hua seemed to get more and more excited as he spoke. "Her father has been very ill these past few days, and the money I gave her can be used to hire a doctor and buy medicine. Because of this, I have to go again tonight!"

Xiang Qi looked at his naive and honest personality and couldn't help but laugh.

"I didn't expect you to have a bit of chivalry. But where do they live?"

"I don't know. I always wait for them at the Dadi Chun Beijing Cuisine Restaurant every night," Shao Hua replied without thinking.

When Xiang Qi heard this, she found it even more ridiculous. (309)
