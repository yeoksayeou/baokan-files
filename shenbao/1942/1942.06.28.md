### Colonel Hirade Discusses: Extremely Heavy Losses of British and American Ships; Difficulties in Replenishment Threaten Survival; Japanese Submarines Active Along the US and Canadian Coasts

Tokyo, 27th, Allied Press: Naval spokesman Colonel Hirade stated at a roundtable discussion at the "Asahi Shimbun" yesterday that the significant losses suffered by British ships pose a grave threat to the country's survival. The country needs at least eight million tons of shipping to survive, but the existing ships of Britain and the United States have been reduced to nine and a half million tons due to attacks by Axis submarines. Since the start of the war, Axis submarines have sunk 17 million tons of British and American ships, of which Japan sank two million tons. If German and Italian submarines can maintain their current destructive power, the existing nine and a half million tons of British and American ships will soon be annihilated. In April and May alone, German and Italian submarines sank two million tons of British and American ships. The current shipbuilding capacity of Britain and the United States is only 250,000 tons per month, making replenishment difficult. As for the British and American warships sunk by the Japanese navy, there are already 162 ships, totaling 747,550 tons, and 101 ships damaged, totaling 420,700 tons.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 27th, Allied Press: The Canadian Naval Department announced yesterday that a Canadian-built ship, currently leased by the Allied forces, was damaged by a torpedo from a Japanese submarine near the west coast of Canada.

### American Triangular Defense Line Feels Threatened

Lisbon, 27th, Havas: Ottawa announced yesterday that several Canadian bombers and fighter squadrons are now stationed in Alaska with the US Air Force to protect maritime communications in the area from the northwest to the American mainland.

Tokyo, 27th, Allied Press: Since the Japanese army launched an offensive in the Aleutian Islands, the position of Alaska has been directly and significantly threatened. Therefore, future developments are worthy of attention. The United States is also urgently seeking to connect the mainland with Alaska via land transportation routes. Apart from air and sea routes, land transportation through Canadian territory has not yet been completed. Currently, going north from Seattle only reaches Whitehorse in Canada, so a highway must be built to connect them. This is the famous Canadian-Alaskan Highway. The proposal for the construction of this highway began in 1929, and in May 1923, President Hoover appointed three commissioners to conduct research. In June 1940, Alaskan representative Tersani requested the House of Representatives to allocate $25 million for the construction of the highway. Until recently, the highway construction plan was being negotiated between the United States and Canada. Previously, on March 17, Havas reported that the United States and Canada had reached a basic agreement on the construction of the highway, but with Alaska now in a dangerous situation, the construction of the highway is unlikely to be realized.

Berlin, 26th, Allied Press: After the Japanese Imperial Headquarters officially announced the news of the Japanese army landing in the Aleutian Islands, the Nazi Party's official newspaper, Angriff, published a commentary on the Japanese military victories in a prominent position on the 25th. The gist of the commentary stated that after the United States was defeated at Pearl Harbor, it repeatedly attempted to counterattack Japan, but the result was another defeat in the Coral Sea. Japan has thus established its absolutely advantageous position and can use important military bases such as Syonan Island to conduct operations in the Pacific. At the same time, the Japanese occupation of the Aleutian Islands has dealt a fatal blow to the 5,000-kilometer-long line from Dutch Harbor to Laval, and the strategic importance of Hawaii has also been reduced. The so-called triangular defense line formed by the United States with Dutch Harbor, Hawaii, and Panama has also been severely threatened.

Indian figures here believe that if the British do not accept this request, the non-cooperation movement will spread throughout India. The British authorities do not seem to value Gandhi's request; they have even refused to publish this declaration because it lists the various reasons why the British should leave India. The British oppression of India is becoming increasingly intolerable to the Indians. As war is increasingly imminent in India, it is necessary for India to take swift action.

### Axis Armored Forces Advance Eastward: Battle of Matruh Begins; British Main Force Establishes Strong Defense Line; Fate of Egypt May Be Decided Soon

Vima, 27th (Havas Dispatch) - General Headquarters announced this morning that Axis forces have made contact with British defending forces in the Marsa Matruh area.

Cairo, 27th (Havas Dispatch) - The British Middle East Command announced this morning that enemy forces reached a point fifteen miles west of Marsa Matruh yesterday. British advance units engaged enemy advance units in battle all day.

Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - According to news from the Egyptian front, the forces under the command of German General Rommel are advancing eastward. The decisive battle that determines the fate of Egypt will occur in the Marsa Matruh area within the next few days. Large armies from both sides are now concentrated near this area. The Axis forces possess a large number of motorized units for rapid encirclement, estimated at five to six hundred tanks and about ten thousand armored vehicles of various sizes.

Lisbon, 26th (Alliance News Agency) - According to a United Press Cairo dispatch, after breaking through the Egyptian border on the night of the 25th, German and Italian forces continued to pursue the British forces. On the night of the 25th, the vanguard reached a location thirty-two kilometers west of Marsa Matruh, a place one hundred and twenty-eight kilometers from the Egyptian border. The German and Italian forces attacked from three sides, while the British forces also concentrated their main force at Marsa Matruh and used air support from Alexandria to reinforce their position and bomb the Axis forces. Another unit was stationed southwest of Marsa Matruh to prevent the German forces from encircling the port. Currently, the vanguard of the German forces has engaged in a fierce tank battle on the open tropical desert with the first line of British defenses.

Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - Military officials here stated that General Rommel decided to attack Marsa Matruh after occupying Tobruk, to pave a path for advancing on Alexandria and Cairo. In recent days, the German forces have been advancing eastward along the Egyptian coast, with no major battles occurring. This is to allow the British forces to cover the retreat of their main force and establish a strong defensive line west of Marsa Matruh. German and Italian reinforcements are continuously arriving at the front lines, so a major battle is expected to occur in the Matruh area soon. According to general opinion, although General Rommel's forces may attempt a large encirclement from the south, they still aim to quickly launch a fierce attack on the British positions. Speculation about General Rommel's strategy varies, simply because there are many natural barriers south of Matruh, so it is predicted that the Axis forces' transportation lines will inevitably be extended. Although the British main force has been redeployed and new positions have been reinforced, the situation remains extremely serious because the German and Italian forces are still very powerful, including the German 21st and 15th Panzer Divisions, as well as the Italian armored divisions. Although the British Eighth Army has suffered setbacks this time, it still possesses a strong fighting force sufficient to defend its positions. In short, the fate of the "Battle for Egypt" will be decided in the next two or three days.

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - German fighter squadrons attacked the railway, barracks, airfield, and motorcycle columns east of Marsa Matruh yesterday. Fires broke out in several locations. A train carrying retreating British soldiers was hit by bombs and severely damaged.

Egyptian Defenses Tighten; British Forces Urgently Await Reinforcements

Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - The British remain silent on whether British forces can quickly obtain reinforcements to defend Egypt. Rumors are circulating that the British Ninth Army and American troops in Syria have set out for Egypt, but the British have made no comment.

Somewhere on the German Border, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - Egyptian defenses are tightening. The British General Headquarters has no other choice but to transfer part of the Ninth Army stationed in Palestine and the Tenth Army stationed in Iraq and Iran to reinforce the defenses. However, both armies are one thousand miles away from Egypt, and the only means of transportation is the railway, which passes through Aleppo, Homs, and Damascus in Syria to reach Alexandria and cannot arrive in less than two or three weeks. However, London is already discussing the possibility of the British army retreating to the Nile River, which is quite surprising. At the same time, the German side claims that Axis forces have now controlled the Sollum and Sidi Barrani airfields, only two hundred and thirty miles from Alexandria. The Egyptian people are closely watching the possibility of Axis forces invading their country. Neutral observers predict that the Axis forces will use Crete and Greece as bases to directly attack the Nile Delta. In addition, a London Times reporter recently warned readers not to be overly optimistic about the extension of the enemy's transportation lines, because the full motorization of the German North African Army is sufficient to overcome some of the difficulties.

Egypt Strictly Adheres to Non-Intervention Policy; Alexandria Evacuates Residents

Istanbul, 25th (Alliance News Agency) - Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas made the following statement in Parliament on the afternoon of the 24th regarding the Libyan war situation and the results of his talks with the British side: "In view of the current situation on the Libyan front, my government has requested information from the British military command and the British Embassy since the 21st and has conducted a detailed review of the British strategy for the war situation. On the 23rd, the British Ambassador sent an official document to my government, stating that the British government has the determination to resist to the end. In my capacity as the military and political leader of Egypt, I have strictly suppressed rumors. Recently, I presented a detailed report on the Libyan war situation to Parliament. I must reiterate that the rumor that my government has accepted Britain's request and declared war on the Axis powers is completely unfounded. My government has consistently adhered to a policy of non-intervention in the war."

Ankara, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas again held a lengthy conversation with Sir Lampson, the British Ambassador to Egypt, yesterday. The Egyptian Parliament had requested the British side to issue a statement explaining the latest developments in the war, but the British side refused the request, stating that revealing the information would make it known to the enemy.

Tokyo, 27th (Alliance News Agency) - According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," residents of Alexandria, Egypt, are evacuating in part due to the rapid advance of the German and Italian forces.

### Kharkov Front Battle: German Forces Capture Two Fortresses; Struggle for Sevastopol Intensifies

Berlin, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - German radio announced tonight that German forces, after unprecedented fierce battles, have occupied the cities of Izyum and Kupyansk. The former is a fortress on the Donets River, which has been repeatedly mentioned during the Battle of Kharkov. The latter is a fortress on the Oskol River, also an industrial center in the Donets River basin. At the same time, the German News Agency also issued a message stating that the German Air Force has been active over Sevastopol, systematically destroying the port of Sevastopol and some remaining positions and fortifications of the Red Army on the western end of the Crimean Peninsula. The Izyum and Kupyansk areas were also bombed. In the central region, German forces bombed various military supply depots and targeted the famous Gorky factory. The Rostov shipyards were also bombed. On the northern front, three Red Army aircraft were destroyed at the Murmansk airfield.

Lisbon, 26th (Alliance News Agency) - A foreign radio station here recently broadcast a Moscow message stating that the Kharkov war has been quite fierce in recent days. German forces crossed the Seversky Donets River and began a fierce attack. The Soviet forces under Timoshenko put up a desperate resistance on the west bank of the Oskol River, but by the 25th, the Soviet forces were unable to withstand the German pressure and retreated to Kupyansk. According to a Soviet Information Bureau announcement on the 26th, German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in a fierce battle with many tanks in the area between the Oskol and Krasnaya Rivers. The situation in Sevastopol is even more intense. German forces have broken into several fortresses outside the city and are now attacking the city center.

Stockholm, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - Axis forces have occupied Kupyansk and Izyum. The extent to which the German offensive launched in the Kharkov area five days ago has developed can be seen from these two battles. Kupyansk is about sixty miles southeast of Kharkov, appropriately at the junction of two railways. German forces may have advanced beyond the city to reach a certain point in order to advance towards Voroshilovgrad in the southeast. Voroshilovgrad and Taganrog are the starting points for attacking the Caucasus. It is reported that the troops stationed between Stanlino and the Sea of Azov during the winter, especially those near Taganrog, will be ordered to move eastward, with Rostov as their first target. This city, known as the gateway to the Caucasus, has been bombed several times. The German offensive in the Donets River basin is currently developing in an organized manner, but the port of Sevastopol is still holding out. According to the latest news, the German and Romanian forces have broken through the Red Army defense line protecting the southeastern corner of Sevastopol Bay. The fortress on that line, the famous Inkenman Heights, is now under heavy German attack. The port of Sevastopol originally had a defense force of two hundred thousand regular soldiers and ten thousand civilians, but since the start of the battle for the city, casualties have been heavy, reducing this number by at least half. The Red Army claims that the ratio of Axis to Red Army strength is five to one. For the past twenty days, no fresh troops have arrived in Sevastopol to reinforce the defenses, and they frankly admit that they cannot recover lost positions or repel the enemy. Their only goal in continuing to resist is to delay the German advance on the Caucasus, as Sevastopol is the best supply base and its position is superior to the ports of Odessa and Romania on the Black Sea coast. Once it falls, it will greatly facilitate the German advance on the Caucasus. The fighting in other areas on the Eastern Front has also become increasingly active. There have been reports of fierce battles in the Bryansk area. In addition, German forces are planning to carry out a clearing operation between Ilmen and Leningrad, which is a preliminary step for attacking Leningrad and Kronstadt. This is why the Finnish-German naval base of Kotka was recently heavily bombed by Red Army aircraft, as Kotka is close at hand and a serious threat to Kronstadt.

Lisbon, 26th (Alliance News Agency) - According to British sources, the German attack on Sevastopol is becoming more intense. The only good Soviet port on the Black Sea has been reduced to rubble by three weeks of intense artillery fire and bombing. All positions have been reduced to ruins. The Soviet forces are now only holding onto the remaining fortress points and putting up a final stand. According to Moscow broadcasts, German forces, with the cooperation of air, tank, and infantry units, are fiercely attacking the northeastern part of the Soviet positions. Bomb and artillery fire continued throughout the 25th, followed by bayonet fighting with Soviet troops. More elite German reinforcements are arriving continuously, and hundreds of tanks have been mobilized for a fierce attack.

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command has issued a statement saying that Soviet troops attempting to land on the Kerch Peninsula were discovered before they could land and were forced to retreat by intense German artillery fire.

Moscow, 26th (Havas Dispatch) - TASS has issued a message acknowledging that German pressure on the Red Army in the Kharkov area and on the Sevastopol front is increasing. The Red Army has been forced to "gradually retreat" in the past two days. Since the fall of Kupyansk, the fighting has intensified. The Red Army is still resisting. In addition, the Red Army newspaper "Red Star" also reported that the Axis powers have concentrated a large force in front of the Red Army's new positions in Sevastopol and have launched a fierce attack, breaking through the Red Army's defenses and occupying an important high ground. The German forces attacked this high ground with three infantry battalions, twelve tanks, and an artillery battery, in seven or eight attacks. Hand-to-hand combat has occurred in the central and southern sectors of the port. The German and Romanian forces have also brought in a large number of reinforcements.

### Britain Closely Monitors Spain's Movements; Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer Returns to Madrid

Tokyo, 27th (Alliance News Agency) - The "Yomiuri Shimbun" today published a report from Stockholm stating that London is watching the outcome of Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer's visit to Rome with deep concern, fearing that the British defeat in Libya may prompt Spain to join the war in support of the Axis powers. Britain is concerned about Spain's future attitude because it understands that Spain's active assistance to the Axis powers would not only toll the death knell for British Mediterranean defenses but would also seriously affect the entire Allied war plan. Britain's concerns are: 1) Spain's entry into the war would be a sign of an Axis attack on Gibraltar. The loss of Gibraltar would paralyze the entire British Mediterranean fleet. 2) Spain's hostility to the Allies would seriously affect or even invalidate the Allied plan to establish a so-called second front in Europe. 3) The French people would be drawn into the European war to help Spain. 4) Spain's entry into the war would allow the Axis powers to take over Fort Capel, the Canary Islands, and the Azores, seriously threatening Allied lines of communication between Britain and Australia.

Paris, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer passed through here this morning on his way back to Madrid from Rome. The Spanish ambassador and other dignitaries welcomed him at the station. It is said that Serrano Suñer does not intend to stay long and will continue his journey home immediately.

### 9 Iraq: Then and Now (Part 2)

Located on the upper reaches of the Tigris River, at an altitude of eight hundred and twenty [feet], is the famous Mosul oil region. Before World War I, it originally belonged to Turkey. During the European war, it was occupied by the British. After the war, the League of Nations entrusted it to British rule. Later, because Turkey defeated Greece, it held a meeting in Lausanne with the great powers such as Britain, France, and Italy. Turkey proposed that the Mosul province be returned to Turkey. Britain firmly refused, only allowing it to give 25% of the net profit each year. Therefore, Iraq's oil rights have always been controlled by Britain.

Before World War I, Germany had what was called the "Three B Policy." What is the "Three B Policy?" It starts from Berlin, passing through Constantinople (Byzantium) to Baghdad, the capital of Persia, planning to build a Euro-Asian railway. Because these three places all start with the letter "B," it was so named. As a result of the last European war, Germany's rights were naturally stripped away, so the Iraqi oil company was exclusively owned by Britain.

At that time, Russia also had what was called the "Two P Policy," which was to build a railway from Petrograd to the Persian Gulf. But in reality, it was all to enrich the rich oil region. America, the Netherlands, and France could not forget to compete for this rich oil region, and Britain and the Netherlands also wanted to get a piece of the action, causing an international oil war. Finally, in 1930, Britain, America, the Netherlands, France, and other countries formed a large international oil company, mining in the vicinity of Kirkuk. However, although nominally an international joint venture, Britain actually held 40% of the mining rights.

The Great Pipeline

Although Iraq has historically been a transportation hub for the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, it has lost its importance since sea routes opened. But since it possesses rich buried oil resources, transportation has become a major problem. Initially, the oil produced in the Mosul oil region was exported through the Persian Gulf via the Tigris River, through the Red Sea, and then to Europe. However, firstly, the detour was troublesome. Secondly, the siltation at the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab River was too severe, which always felt inconvenient. Thirdly, it was inconvenient for supplying the British Mediterranean fleet. Therefore, someone planned to transport this rich oil directly to the Mediterranean coast. The international oil company formed by Britain, America, France, the Netherlands, and Poland raised capital, and then hired American engineers to design the laying of the pipeline. After seven years of work, this great pipeline project was finally completed on January 21, 1935. It is 1,150 miles long and cost more than ten million dollars. It can be said to be one of the world's great projects.

The laying of this pipeline starts from the Kirkuk oil region to Haditha on the Euphrates River, dividing into two routes: one crosses Iraq and then crosses Syria westward to Tripoli on the Mediterranean coast, and the other crosses the Syrian desert to the southwest, then turns south through Transjordan and enters Palestine, and then reaches Haifa on the Mediterranean coast. Since the completion of this great pipeline project, the company's transportation costs have been greatly reduced, and the total annual output now often reaches more than four million tons.

Vulnerable National Defense

Iraq's national defense, due to its weak national strength, is naturally very vulnerable. According to the 1938 national census, Iraq had a standing army of 28,000 men, and military expenditure was about 1.5 million Dinars, equivalent to about 1.5 million pounds in British currency. All young men between the ages of 19 and 25 have the obligation to serve in the military, adopting the conscription system of modern countries.

Because Iraq has very little contact with the sea, it has no naval defenses, so its national defense is mainly based on the army. Its strength can be divided into: 1) two cavalry regiments; 2) nine field artillery companies; 3) five mountain artillery companies; 4) one mechanized infantry company; 5) one machine gun vehicle company; 6) one signal battalion; 7) one armored car battalion; 8) one engineer battalion; 9) one naval platoon. However, to become a modern country, there must be some air defense, so Iraq has also established an air force for the sake of appearances. Its strength includes: 1) two reconnaissance aircraft squadrons; 2) one bomber squadron; 3) one fighter squadron; 4) one liaison aircraft squadron. This is the strength of Iraq's military.

However, in order to protect its oil interests, Britain has military bases in Iraq. The headquarters of the Air Force is located fifty miles northwest of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. It cost 50 million pounds to open a large amphibious airfield, stationed with hundreds of aircraft, and also has heavy troops stationed in Iraq. In the north, the Soviet Union also has corresponding air and ground forces stationed in the Caucasus, threatening Iraq.

Baghdad is located in the middle reaches of the Tigris River, on the main route of land and water transportation. It is the capital of Iraq and a gathering place for caravan trade, with a population of about 350,000. The telegraph line between Europe and India passes through Aleppo from here. During World War I, Britain and Turkey fought fiercely here. During the heyday of Islam, the Caliph used this as a base. It was the old capital of the Saracen Empire and the center of Arab scholarship. Today, the Ministry of National Defense of the Iraqi government is located at the north gate of Baghdad, using the former headquarters of Turkey as its troop garrison.

### Public Works Department Announcement: Issuance of Scrip is Prohibited from Today; Scrip Already Issued Must be Recalled by the Beginning of Next Month and Cannot be Forced to be Used to Purchase Goods

The proclamation clearly stipulates that scrip should be redeemed with cash and cannot be forced to be used to purchase goods. Any company found to be issuing scrip after July 11th will be severely punished. It has been found that a large number of stores, dance halls, etc., are using the excuse of difficulty in making change to issue scrip without approval and are using goods as a substitute for cash when redeeming the scrip instead of paying a fine. This not only hinders the circulation of currency but also increases the burden on citizens' purchases. At present, there are already sufficient subsidiary currency notes in the city, so there is no need for the issuance of scrip. Citizens who discover that any company is issuing scrip after July 11th are requested to report it to the police in writing so that it can be investigated and dealt with.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, Regulations Have Been Revised, Donations Are Purely Voluntary and Never Solicited

Since the launch of the third Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund campaign, it has received enthusiastic responses from all parties. Letters from all walks of life have been continuously received with enthusiastic support. Yesterday, the Progressive Students' Association also sent a letter with practical suggestions, and the Sino-Japanese Language Institute donated 20 half-fee scholarships. Their letters are recorded below.

Letter from the Progressive Students' Association contributing opinions: "Having read the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Supplement, we are very impressed. We, colleagues, regard it as a noble duty to promote human mutual assistance, and are willing to donate according to our ability, and at any time and place solicit donations from elders, relatives, friends, shop owners, etc., so as to accumulate a little bit to make a large amount, which we believe will be approved by the public. We also hope that all sectors will have the same aspirations and donate according to their ability, then thousands of out-of-school youths will be grateful without end. This is our humble opinion, and we hope it will be considered." The kindness of the gentlemen of the Association is deeply admired by us. However, the solicitation of donations for the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund is entirely based on voluntary donations from people from all walks of life, and has never been solicited from the outside world. This is something that must be reiterated to all sectors.

Sino-Japanese Language Institute Donates Scholarships: Letter from the Sino-Japanese Language Institute at 34 Foch Road, South of the Old City God Temple Market: "To whom it may concern, our institute has specially set up 20 half-fee places for poor scholars to study Japanese. Anyone recommended by your newspaper will be approved by our institute in order to serve the purpose of serving the society and cultivate Japanese talents. We hope that your newspaper will recommend them on our behalf. Sincerely yours, Dean of Studies Wen Niaowu Xiong. (Note) Please recommend students to the school before July 10th for placement in various grades."

Revised Regulations of the Scholarship Fund: The regulations of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund are hereby revised as follows: (Article 1) The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund is established in the spirit of human mutual assistance to subsidize outstanding young students in primary, secondary, and higher education who are eager to pursue further studies. (Article 2) Orphans, as well as those from poor families who are indeed unable to continue their studies and whose academic performance in major subjects is above 80 points and whose overall average is above 70 points, and whose conduct is rated B or above, and are recommended by the school authorities, or other credible proof, and are deemed qualified by this newspaper through review or examination, may enjoy subsidies in accordance with these regulations. (However, the primary school part must be after the end of the fourth academic year before requesting assistance.) (Article 3) The procedures for applying for scholarships are as follows: (1) Obtain an application form from this office, fill it out in detail in your own handwriting in accordance with the items listed on the form, and affix two and a half-inch half-length photos. (2) Submit the school report card for the most recent semester, as well as other documents such as certificates and awards that prove their excellent academic performance. (3) In addition to being signed by the applicant student, the end of the application form should also be signed and sealed by the parent or guardian and the school principal. (4) Industrial and commercial employees who apply to enter a supplementary school for further studies must have a transcript and a letter of certification from the service business with the seal of the business and obtain the admission certificate to be qualified. (Article 4) The amount of the scholarship applied for should be filled in by the applicant, but must be accompanied by the school's fee schedule to prove the authenticity of the amount. However, regardless of universities, vocational schools, primary and secondary schools, and supplementary schools, the application for tuition fees is the principle. In special circumstances, miscellaneous fees and book fees prescribed in the school fee schedule may also be applied for, but the review may still be handled at the discretion of the circumstances. (Article 5) The date for applying for scholarships each semester will be announced temporarily in January and July of each year according to the prescribed academic qualifications. (Article 6) After the applicant has been reviewed and approved, the school fee bill should be submitted on the designated date. After being collected by this office, it will be paid to the Gu Bank, which collects the tuition fees on behalf of the school. For those who do not entrust the bank to collect fees on their behalf, this office will directly pay the school. (Article 7) Applicants shall exchange the school fee receipt and other supporting documents from this office with the registration card issued by this office. (Article 8) The scholarship is awarded on a per-semester basis. Students who have already received scholarships shall submit their academic report cards to this office for verification at the end of the semester. Those whose major subjects in the current semester are above 80 points, whose overall average is above 70 points, whose conduct is B or above, and who want to continue their studies and whose family economy has not improved, may apply for priority to receive the scholarship in accordance with the prescribed procedures. (Article 9) The number of scholarships to be awarded may be determined in light of the economic situation. If the number of scholarships is about to be exhausted and several applicants are in the same academic and economic situation, the order of application shall be the standard for review and selection. (Article 10) This office may send personnel to investigate the academic performance of young people who enjoy scholarships from this office, or send letters to invite them to visit the office for an interview. (Article 11) Those who receive scholarships should repay the scholarships in one lump sum or in installments when their parents or themselves have the ability to repay, so as to help others. However, those who donate according to their ability are even more welcome. (Article 12) These regulations may be revised at any time if they are not perfect. (Revised in June 1942)

Family

### Three Things Worth Promoting

— Yi

We would like to specially propose the following three things, which we believe are closely related to the family, and we ask readers to pay attention to and promote them.

Youth Association Holds Health and Nutrition Exhibition

The Youth Association holds health campaigns every summer to publicize health knowledge. The holding of such exhibitions undoubtedly makes a great contribution to society, because if we can know more about health knowledge, we can not only protect the health of ourselves and our families, but also promote the health of the entire society.

This year's health campaign has one more characteristic, that is, it particularly emphasizes nutritional knowledge, so that the common people can also enjoy the nutrition they need. From tomorrow until July 1, on the second floor of the Baxianqiao Clubhouse, in addition to displaying various charts, models, specimens, and articles, there will also be performances. It is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day, and there is no admission fee. Since we have this rare opportunity, it is indeed worth visiting.

Mr. Zhou Wenyan's Savings for Assistance

The scholarship fund organized by this newspaper had very good results the first time, and the second time is now underway. In this newspaper on June 26, there was a news item that Mr. Zhou Wenyan sent 1,000 yuan of his savings from his usual zero-deposit fixed savings, which was converted into 500 yuan of savings certificates, to this newspaper as a reader's scholarship fund. This kind of action is really admirable. Mr. Zhou is able to help other hardworking young people with his private savings after feeling fortunate to have been cultivated by his parents. He can indeed be called a model of modern youth. From this, we can also know that Mr. Zhou's parents have cultivated him well, which is worthy of our admiration. There is no shortage of young people in society who are in a similar situation to Mr. Zhou. After reading this news, they will definitely respond in droves and enthusiastically help with scholarships.

Health Care Movement

Health is needed by everyone, especially at a time like now. We must have a strong physique in order to cope with all difficulties and overcome the threats of life with an inspiring, promising, and indomitable spirit.

If we want to achieve this goal, we must pay attention to exercise, because the importance of exercise is really no different from sunshine, air, and diet. Without exercise, there is no way to ensure health. So-called exercise does not necessarily require going to a gym. As long as you have perseverance, and the method of practice is simple and effective. Now the Japanese journal has begun to publish the Mr. Health Care Exercise Method; the health of the body will undoubtedly be guaranteed. If we want to enjoy personal and family health and happiness, we hope that readers and their entire family, parents, children, will all study and practice this new method of exercise that is worth studying.

### Weaning Infants Should Not Be Done Arbitrarily

— Mao Ren

Recently, most mothers have become nervous when dealing with infants. When the child's stool turns green, they think it is athlete's foot; if the child vomits milk, they think the milk is not suitable. Because of this reason, they do not formally review it from a medical standpoint, and they wean the child. However, the mother's milk is really a good and appropriate food for the child. It should be provided to the child by proper methods as much as possible. It can also be said that it is the first step to make the child have a healthy physique for life. When the child is eating the mother's milk, even if the stool is slightly greenish, the mother does not have to worry anxiously. If you are really worried, you can take the child to an infant health care hospital or a specialist doctor for a consultation. If a mother who does not understand medical principles treats her child indiscriminately because she loves him too much, she may even lose the child's health.

### Comparison of Several Kinds of Rice

— Hua

Our main food is rice, but there are many kinds of rice. Now, we have specially invited Dr. Hou Xiangchuan of the Physiological Science Group of the Shanghai Lester Institute for Medical Research to list the nutritional components of various kinds of rice for readers' reference:

No. 1 White Rice, Brown Rice, Indica Rice, Corn, Millet, White Sorghum Rice, Red Sorghum Moisture 12.25, 13.99, 13.78, 9.6, 10.02, 16.14, 13.27 Protein 7.29, 6.68, 7.12, 12.7, 9.27, 5.67, 6.94 Fat 0.46, 0.35, 0.26, 7.3, 3.15, 2.26, 4.64 Carbohydrates 79.16, 74.98, 77.40, 68.4, 75.71, 74.03, 71.98 Calories per 100 Cubic Centimeters 358, 338, 349, 350, 377, 348, 328 Calcium 0.05, 0.06, 0.06, 0.006, 0.14, 0.04, 0.17 Iron 0.02, 0.05, 0.001, 0.009, 0.007, 0.009, 0.028 Vitamin A 0, 10, 0, 11, 10 Vitamin B 0, 10 Vitamin C 0, 0, 0 Vitamin D 11 Vitamin E 0, 10 Vitamin F 0, 10, 0, 11, 10

According to the above comparison, corn has the best nutrition, followed by millet and brown rice, then sorghum and rice, and finally indica rice. In order to take care of the nutritional needs, several kinds of rice can be eaten together, or they can be changed from time to time.

Friend of Children

### Children, Pay Attention

— Li

This issue of this magazine is a special issue on health and nutrition. Children can refer to the articles published in this magazine in many places. For example, from now on, we should not eat snacks in our spare time, because eating snacks is not hygienic.

At the same time, when eating, we should no longer pick fish and meat and leave vegetables uneaten, because there are many nutrients in vegetables, which are better than fish and meat.

There is also one point. From this issue onwards, we will publish the Health Care Exercise Method on a regular basis. Children can also learn it every time, so that soon, those of us who are weak can become strong, and those who are already strong can become even stronger. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

### Family Maxims

· An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

· A sharp mind resides in a sound body.

### Household Matters

— Wang Lemin

When boiling eggs, add a little edible salt to the water, then the boiled eggs will be easier to peel and taste better.

Freshly inserted flowers are easily withered. If you split the end of the stem and insert edible salt

### Twelve Major Slogans of the Youth Association's Nutrition Campaign

Eating is to make the body get nutrition and increase health.

Food is not about eating a lot, but should pay attention to the nutritional content.

It is better to eat nutritious foods than to eat supplements.

If you know the method of nutrition, the patient can turn from weak to strong.

Eating vegetarian food is not only more economical but also more nourishing.

Pay attention to the freshness of the side dishes you buy.

During the summer vacation, food should focus on cleanliness and strictly prevent flies.

Please everyone get up and study the nutritional content of food.

Eating should be regular and avoid eating too much.

The rich are easy to pay attention to nutrition, and the poor can also pay attention to nutrition.

Food should be chewed slowly, because the combination of saliva and food is the beginning of digestion.

Avoid eating snacks when you are idle, otherwise it will hinder digestion and development. Then tie it tightly with a string, and then insert it into a bottle and add 80% water, which can last longer.

When bathing, the glass mirror is always obscured by thick soda water, which is very inconvenient; if you first wipe a thin layer of soap on the mirror, and then wipe it with a soft cloth until it is as bright as before; in this way, even if there is extremely thick soda water in the room, the mirror will still be clear as usual.

### Small Fun

— Yushan Chengmin

After the schools are closed for the holidays, children may wish to do these arithmetic problems carefully in addition to reviewing their lessons at home. They will definitely find it very interesting.

I think there must be some children who often ask their parents how long it will take to fill the abacus with thirteen blocks of beads, one by one, with one carried over every ten? At first glance, it seems that it can be filled in a while, but in fact it is not that easy.

If you calculate at 150 abacus beads per minute, it will take 211,398 years, 7 months, 13 days, 19 hours, 51 minutes and 6 seconds to fill a thirteen-block abacus. If the average person can live to eighty years old, it will take 2,643 generations to pass it on before the last person fills an abacus at the age of thirty-eight years, seven months, thirteen days, nineteen hours, fifty-one minutes and six seconds; however, the time for sleeping and other times must also be included. Children, isn't this an amazing number? (Remittance to help loan scholarship)

### Outside the Three Hundred and Sixty Industries

— Xingye

Three young people in Chicago, USA, founded a new business, replacing others' memory dates. This is a profession outside of the three hundred and sixty industries. Forgetful or busy people can make a contract with them to have them remember birthdays, wedding days, appointments, and other important dates. Then, on the appropriate date, they will notify you by phone or in writing. The fee is US$1.50 per year for eight dates. Their office is not large. There is a small window against the wall where they make appointments with customers. On the wall hangs a calendar. According to the recorded dates, they are busy making phone calls every day to report to regular customers.

### Work

— Tianye

To make yourself do more work, this can be used as a kind of stimulation to use your talents as much as possible.

Do more than others expect of you! If your colleagues are lazy, you can help them and learn a little more. If you complain about them or try to be even lazier than them, then you are hurting yourself. Organize your work, and you can have a certain goal. The list of winners of the Family Weekly Small Arithmetic Problems is published in the classified column on page 8 of this newspaper, and the remaining balance will be published next Sunday. Please pay attention, children.

### One Week's Family Menu

— Ms. Huaying

These past few days, going to the market, all the housewives are sighing and complaining to each other, saying that they brought ten yuan of the new legal tender, but can't buy much to take back. Fish and meat go without saying, but even vegetables and melons have all risen sharply, and the vegetable vendors don't calculate the ratio of new to old legal tender at 1:2. Moreover, some even exceed the original prices of the old legal tender. If this continues, how can people maintain the seven daily necessities? Now, the authorities are strictly suppressing prices and there's talk of controlling vegetable prices. This is truly the most urgent task at hand, and we hope it will be implemented soon.

The "Health Exercise" method is a very effective exercise method that anyone, male or female, young or old, can practice. When practicing, no equipment is needed, no money is required, the method is very simple, and it is not limited by time. Anyone can practice at the time they consider most appropriate, as long as they persevere, practice on time every day according to the method, they can definitely turn the weak into the strong, and the healthy into the healthier, to achieve the goal of ensuring health.

Why does "Health Exercise" have such an effect? According to the inventor, the famous American hygiene expert McGowan, it uses the position of lying flat on the body, with the least amount of labor, to do various exercises to promote the strengthening of the abdominal muscles, thereby making the digestive system, excretory system, and blood circulation work in an orderly manner and function properly. With this kind of natural physical strength, there is no fear of disease invasion, and so-called indigestion, anemia, constipation, insomnia and all weakening phenomena disappear into nothingness.

There are a total of twenty-seven types of health exercises. Practicing in this way every day can make all the body's organs have average and full development. In order to enable readers and their families to enjoy health and happiness, this magazine specially introduces it to readers with twelve points of sincerity. Starting from this issue, it will be published continuously on a regular basis. Please pay attention to readers.

### Government Bond Trends Not Yet Stable, But There Are Also Those Taking Advantage of Low Prices to Absorb

Yesterday's government bond gray market saw unstable public sentiment, with many floating positions continuing to be closed out, and market prices continuing to weaken. At the same time, there were also many covering short positions, and a few taking advantage of the low prices to absorb. The trend was no longer as severe as the previous day's decline. During this eventful period, a sudden surge in the bond market is probably not yet the time. However, there is absolutely no fundamental problem. When the market first opened yesterday, the opening prices of each bond were still stable. The opening price for Class B was 38 yuan, which was higher than the closing price from the previous day. Afterwards, due to the outflow of floating positions, the market gradually weakened, but then recovered after falling to a low, and the closing price was several points higher than the lowest price. After this stimulation, the market situation is not easy to stabilize for a while. Because the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, and everyone's concepts are different.
