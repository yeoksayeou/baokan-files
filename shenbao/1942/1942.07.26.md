Deposits from all parties are above four million yuan, of which overseas Chinese account for about one million yuan, and there is a continued increase. Overseas Chinese in Surabaya have always been at the center of economic activity, so this trend is quite important. Japanese deposits have also reached 600,000 yuan, so the economic activity in the Dutch East Indies can be said to have completely gotten back on track.

### Argentina and the United States Maintain Normal Relations: Statements by the Argentine Ambassador to the United States

Tokyo, 25th, DOMEI News Agency: The news that Argentine Foreign Minister Guani stated that he would sever ties with the Pan-American group has caused a major international reaction. In order to clarify the truth, this agency contacted its Buenos Aires branch via international telephone at 6:30 a.m. on the 25th. According to reports, the Argentine Foreign Minister's statement has not been formally released here. Only San Francisco has broadcast the Argentine Foreign Minister's statement, which stated that Argentina is not bound by the resolutions of the Pan-American Foreign Ministers' meeting in January of this year. Two newly established American newspapers here immediately published this, as well as news of a meeting with Foreign Minister Guani. The two newspapers were suspended on the fifth day after their establishment, the reason being that they published news about the Argentine Foreign Minister's speech in a secret parliament. As for the claim that Argentina has withdrawn from the Pan-American group, it may not be a complete withdrawal. It is only because the American newspapers published news broadcast from San Francisco and about the meeting with the Argentine Foreign Minister, which has caused the Argentine authorities to be confused about the truth. Regarding the incident in which the United States confiscated the Argentine ship Victoria, Argentina's attitude towards the pressure from the United States is quite strong. However, according to the report of the Argentine ambassador to the United States, who recently returned to the country, there are no signs of tension in the relations between the two countries. Furthermore, Argentina is completely self-sufficient economically, except for coal. It has recently signed a purchase treaty with Colombia. However, Argentine officials are quite angry about the United States hindering the transport of coal on Argentine ships. In short, Argentina, under a very strict neutral stance, will never yield to pressure from the United States.

### Labor Unrest in Australian Coal Mines Subsides

Stockholm, 25th, Reuter Agency: According to a report from Sydney, the Australian government's suggestion to stop the unnecessary strike by coal miners has been accepted by the representatives of the 54 branches of the Northern Australian Coalfields Union yesterday.

Australia promulgated a new law yesterday, stipulating that anyone who causes or participates in a strike will be fined 100 pounds or imprisoned for six months. The Coal Miners' Federation will impose penalties on those who attempt to cause a strike. First-time offenders will be suspended from work for two weeks, and repeat offenders will be expelled from the union. Subsequently, miners' strikes must be approved by the local administrative authorities. Australian Prime Minister Curtin revealed that the Coal Miners' Federation has sworn to the government to continue production, and he has accepted this.

### Japanese Denials

Tokyo, 25th, DOMEI News Agency: The American side claimed that after Tokyo was attacked on April 18, Prime Minister Tojo was inspecting a certain factory when a worker threw a hammer at him, but he was not injured.

In fact, Prime Minister Tojo's daily activities are recorded and can be verified, and there have been no rumors of such accidents within Japan.

### German Criticism of Hull's Remarks

Berlin, 25th, Reuter Agency: German Information Chief Dietrich criticized US Secretary of State Hull's speech yesterday, saying that when people around the world are watching the brave battles and great victories of the German army and its allies in southern Russia, public opinion will not be changed by a vague speech. The current problem cannot be solved, yet he wants to talk about future dreams, which is ridiculous. What Hull talked about was the reorganization of the world after the Allied victory. The most important issue related to the near future is winning, and the sooner the better, but he did not mention how to win, only that he would assist and encourage the Soviet Union. Hull's drumming sound is meant to awaken America's attention to the severity of the situation, which also shows that Americans do not pay attention to the war. European countries are used to hearing the hypocritical and煽動演說 of the White House. A speech delivered after three years of war must grasp the key to victory to attract attention. The moral speech of an aging politician gives people the impression of a dirge for a fallen world. Hull said that the United States has adhered to the principle of non-interference and strived to promote world peace, etc. Dietrich commented, "The fact that I reserve is that those who brought the world into war are the democracies." If it were not for the煽動 of Wiesford and his staff, the war between Germany and Poland could have been localized and resolved in Europe without causing the whole world to suffer from war again. Today, we are encountering the same reactionary elements committing unprecedented crimes against humanity, destroying the peace that humanity cherishes, and propagandizing morality in the name of humanity, and inducing humanity to believe that the victory of the financial tycoons is the guarantee of world security. This hypocrisy must be exposed. The victories of Britain and the United States have now been sold to the Soviet Union. This kind of victory cannot guarantee the peace of the European people, but will lead to the endless war and the demise of the Europeans. The United States is constantly angering us and Germany's allies, and dares not openly participate in the war, but adopts a cowardly attitude and adopts a policy of assisting Britain. The freedom, human dignity, and civilization that Hull talked about are political heresies implemented by Churchill and Roosevelt in political life. The Anglo-Saxon nation has thrown morality into the mire and should not arrogantly talk about using morality as a weapon. The United States, which insults the major cultural countries of Europe, should humbly recall that these countries once guided the United States to enter the initial stage of civilization. Today, the intellectual class in the United States still cannot understand the fundamental concept of a new world and the power that promotes the great European movement. The United States is still ignorant of the awakening of the new European spirit. The United States is allied with destructive Bolshevism and is ungrateful, and will eventually suffer the consequences of its actions, which is its demise.

### Methods for Merging Major Japanese Newspapers; Italian Newspapers Reduce Pages

Tokyo, 25th, Reuter Agency: According to well-informed sources, the Japanese newspaper industry has discussed the merger plan of various newspapers with government authorities, and detailed methods have been decided.

### British and American Labor Unions Establish a Joint Committee to Cooperate with Soviet Trade Unions

Washington, 24th, Havas Agency: Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, the right-wing labor union in the United States, officially stated this month that after a long period of talks between the American Federation of Labor and the British Trades Union Congress, an agreement has been reached to establish a joint British-American Trade Union Committee. England has always advocated organizing a joint committee of representatives of trade unions from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but the United States has always opposed this. Currently, the United States believes that since there is already a joint committee between the trade unions of England and the Soviet Union, the United States can use this mechanism to establish contact with the Soviet trade unions and also consider assisting the Soviet workers who are working hard for the war effort.

### Allied Merchant Ships Suffer Significant Losses; British People are Alarmed and Uneasy

Dublin, 24th, Havas Agency: The US Intelligence Agency recently released a message admitting that the ships lost by the Allies in the week from the 6th to the 12th of this month far exceeded their shipbuilding capacity. This has caused alarm and unease among the British people. Most newspapers in London have demanded that the exact number of ship losses be announced. The Times published an editorial, stating the precarious situation of the Allies, saying: We have always concealed the development of the current war, but now we are finally beginning to understand it. The United States should be responsible for this. Judging from the recent situation of ship losses released by the US Intelligence Agency, it is not difficult to infer the occurrence of such unfortunate events. It has only been a week. We know that the number of Allied ship losses announced by the German High Command is exaggerated and untrustworthy, but if this number is unfortunately true, then we should know that the Allies are in a precarious situation, not only encountering great difficulties, but also their supply of materials is extremely dangerous.

### Spain's Anti-Communist Stance Remains Unchanged; Strengthening Its Own Strength is Considered a Matter of Urgency

Madrid, 24th, Havas Agency: The well-known "Daily News" here published a commentary today, strongly stating that Spain's current stance will not change, saying that although Spain is full of anti-Marxist sentiment, all its actions should still be based on national interests. In the past few years, our country's international status has been somewhat unclear. It is true, but at this moment it is extremely clear. Five years ago, when the civil war broke out in the country, Chief Franco had the idea of resisting Marxism. To this day, the chief still maintains the same idea. There is currently no reason to change this attitude in the slightest. At the same time, no event has occurred between the countries to make our country change this stance. In the future, our country's urgent task is to work hard to strengthen its own strength. That's all.

### German Forces Forcefully Cross the Don River; Major Battle Unfolds East of Rostov; Railroad Line to Moscow Cut Off

Berlin, Allied News Agency dispatch, 25th: German forces advancing towards Stalingrad have begun crossing the Don River south of the Don River bend, with fierce fighting erupting at key crossing points. News from both Berlin and Moscow reports this development. Soviet sources state that heavy fighting is taking place in the Tsimlyansk region, about halfway between Rostov and Stalingrad, and that German forces have begun crossing the Don River in this area.

German Supreme Headquarters, Havas News Agency dispatch, 25th: This afternoon's German war bulletin claimed that isolated remnants of enemy forces in the Rostov area have been completely eliminated. Street fighting in Novocherkassk, east of Rostov, is extremely fierce. A major battle has unfolded east of Rostov. German and allied forces west of Stalingrad have reached the Don River. North and northwest of Voronezh, enemy infantry and tank units have repeatedly attempted to break through our lines and are still engaged in fierce fighting.

Berlin, Havas News Agency dispatch, 25th: Military sources here revealed that German forces have occupied Novocherkassk, a city 40 kilometers northeast of Rostov. The railway from Rostov to Moscow passes through this city, which currently has a population of 80,000.

Lisbon, Allied News Agency dispatch, 24th: According to integrated reports received here, after breaching the Soviet defense line at Rostov on the 24th, German forces swarmed into the city. Soviet forces used prominent buildings as cover to continue their stubborn resistance, engaging the German forces in fierce hand-to-hand combat. After intensive clearing operations by the German forces, the remaining Soviet troops retreated towards the south bank of the Don River. In addition to attacking the rearguard of the Soviet forces, the German forces also dispatched air forces to bomb Soviet troops attempting to cross the Don River, as well as bridges and small boats on the river. In the Tsimlyansk area, unprecedented tank battles have erupted in the past two days. A unit of German forces broke through the Soviet lines and crossed the Don River to the east bank, while another unit also successfully crossed the river, cutting off the railway between Moscow and Stalingrad. Stalingrad is now surrounded on three sides by German forces.

Moscow, Havas News Agency dispatch, 25th: The Soviet Information Bureau issued a war bulletin this morning stating that last night, our forces engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the Voronezh, Tsimlyanskaya, Novocherkassk, and Veshenskaya areas. Red Army forces in the Rostov area abandoned several strongholds. Our forces used a small number of troops to resist a large number of German tanks and infantry. German forces broke through the defense line at some points, and the two armies engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat. Approximately 2,000 enemy soldiers were killed and 18 tanks were destroyed. In another stronghold, the Red Army's resistance was strong. The German forces only managed to advance after killing the last of the defending soldiers. The German losses far exceeded ours. There were no major changes in other sectors of the front.

City of Rostov Ablaze; Defending Forces Still Resist Fiercely

Somewhere on the Soviet border, Havas News Agency dispatch, 24th: The situation on the Rostov front is still impossible to fully ascertain. It is only known that the city is currently engulfed in flames. Unprecedented fierce fighting has occurred in the city and its suburbs. German forces, with Slovak troops providing cover, have continued to advance, breaking through the Red Army's defenses regardless of how fortified they are. Another German motorized unit, after occupying the city of Stalingradin, attacked Rostov from the east. However, after entering the city, the German forces encountered significant difficulties. Not only was the weather extremely hot, but the widespread fires made it unbearable. Therefore, the German advance has slowed. Before retreating, the Red Army had planted landmines in various locations, which are now exploding continuously. Sometimes, entire buildings are seen being thrown into the air. The Red Army is still resisting fiercely in certain areas, engaging the German forces in hand-to-hand combat. There are still no fewer than several thousand soldiers engaged in street fighting amidst the flames.

Berlin, Havas News Agency dispatch, 25th: Last night, various circles here praised the heroic deeds of the German forces in encircling and attacking the city of Rostov, as well as the speed with which they breached the defending forces' defense line. German forces have forcefully crossed the Don River at several points and established several bridgehead fortifications, which will serve as bases for the advance into the Caucasus. The resistance of the Soviet forces in the Stalingrad area has also been broken in some sectors. Soviet forces are still defending in the mountains west of the Don River, but German forces are carrying out annihilation operations. There are no major changes on other fronts.

### Egyptian "Siwa" Oasis Occupied by Italian Forces; Expected to Affect the Later Stages of the War; British Forces in the Middle East Transferred to Egypt for Reinforcement

Rome, Allied News Agency dispatch, 24th: After occupying Jarabub, Italian forces in North Africa occupied the Siwa Oasis a few days ago. Both Jarabub and Siwa are strategic locations in the Sahara Desert, serving as the only trade route from Libya to Cairo. The route starts from Jarabub and Siwa, and leads directly south to the Qattara Depression. Therefore, the Italian occupation of these two locations will have a significant impact on the future development of the war. Qattara is a low-lying area, with its lowest point being 80 meters below sea level. The aforementioned route is the only transportation route in western Egypt. This important location has always been in the hands of British forces. The Axis forces have often been in danger of being encircled and attacked. Now that the Italian forces have occupied these two locations, not only has this danger been removed, but the Axis forces can take action to encircle the British forces.

Rome, Havas News Agency dispatch, 24th: Military sources here recently stated that the Italian occupation of the Egyptian "Siwa" oasis will bring about a major change in the Egyptian war situation. After occupying Jarabub, the Axis forces have occupied this oasis in the desert, cutting off an important transportation line of the British forces. Until now, the British forces have always used this road to threaten the rear of the Axis forces, and attempted to disrupt the Axis forces' transportation lines with motorized units, preventing them from transporting military supplies to the El Alamein area of Egypt. But at this point, after the Italian forces occupied Siwa, they can use this as a base to attack central Egypt. The Italian forces also plan to reach the British forces' positions in the El Alamein area from the side. In addition, according to reliable sources, the British forces still want to transfer fresh troops to Egypt for reinforcement via the Suez Canal, including a New Zealand division, an Australian division, and a division of armored vehicles, which have been transferred from the Middle East to North Africa. After these reinforcements arrive, they can enable the British forces to counterattack. Therefore, the British forces began a counterattack on the 21st of this month, and fierce fighting continued yesterday. Although the British offensive was extremely fierce, the Axis forces held their original positions firmly. General Auchinleck used his infantry to fight along the coast, while transferring motorized units to the south for a counterattack, but they were all repelled by the German and Italian artillery. The British forces lost 1,000 killed, 1,000 captured, and 130 tanks. Most of the military equipment seized by the Axis forces in the North African theater is made in the United States, but the US military has not yet directly participated in the war. It is heard that US merchant ships carrying large quantities of military equipment have sailed from the United States to the Suez Canal. Most of the US military equipment is tanks and aircraft. Although the US side has worked hard to improve the tanks, the facts prove that they are not particularly excellent.

### Egyptian Troops Defend National Territory; US Troops Take Over Iraq

Stockholm, Allied News Agency dispatch, 25th: According to news from Cairo, British forces stationed in Egypt are continuing to withdraw from various parts of Egypt to strengthen the Alamein defense line. After the British forces withdrew, the Egyptian command immediately ordered Egyptian troops to take over the locations vacated by the British forces in order to protect national interests. It is reported that Egyptian troops have replaced British troops in guarding railway hubs and the Suez Canal. The Egyptian troops have also received orders from the command to open fire on anyone who violates these occupied locations, regardless of whether they are British troops.

Vichy, Allied News Agency dispatch, 24th: According to a Havas News Agency dispatch from Egypt, the Egyptian government has decided to close the road between Cairo and Alexandria, prohibiting all traffic, and has ordered Egyptian troops to protect industrial facilities, railways, shipping lanes, and ships.

Berlin, Allied News Agency dispatch, 24th: According to a Havas News Agency dispatch from Ankara on the 24th, all British troops stationed in Iraq have now been transferred to the Egyptian front. The defense of that country has been taken over by US troops. US troops are continuing to arrive in Basra.

### Iran Hires American Military Advisors

Erzurum, Turkey, Havas News Agency dispatch, 24th: Iranian Army Minister Jahanbani announced today that the Iranian Army Ministry has hired two American advisors, one a transportation expert and the other an aviation expert.

### Mysterious Egypt (2)

After this, the Turkish Empire gradually declined, and Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, though his navy was destroyed by the American Nelson, he still managed to land and defeat the Mamluks. But soon (1798-1801), Napoleon hurriedly returned due to internal French problems and abandoned Egypt. At this time, a certain Mehmet Ali, originally a general in the Turkish army, took advantage of this opportunity to rule Egypt, and then forced the Turkish government to recognize him and his descendants as the governors of Egypt in perpetuity. He also established a new army and occupied the upper reaches of the Nile. His son inherited his father's business in 1849. He personally admired Western culture very much, so he organized Egypt in an orderly manner, making it a modern country. In 1859, he agreed to the French opening the canal in the Suez Isthmus, so his merits are not small either.

Strangely enough, this Suez Canal was originally built jointly by the French and Egyptians, and the shares were also in their hands. But later, the power fell entirely into the hands of the British, which is indeed a strange thing. In fact, Britain took advantage of the incompetence and ignorance of the Egyptian Governor appointed in 1863, and bought all his shares. At the same time, France was in disarray, and the French shares were also bought up by them. The British also had political ambitions, and further seized Egypt's financial power, interfering in their administration. The Egyptian people could not bear this foreign aggression, so they rose up in resistance in 1882, but could not withstand the pressure of the British army, and formally became a British territory. During the Great War, the Egyptian people suffered deeply from British exploitation, so in 1918, a leader of the national independence movement, Saad Zaghlul Pasha, emerged. Although he also went to great lengths to organize the people to resist together, the British were only perfunctory and achieved nothing. He was later arrested by the British in 1921 and imprisoned in Gibraltar. Two years later, he was released and returned to his country, and took office as Prime Minister, demanding independence from Britain. The British made excuses to shirk their responsibilities, and it was not successful. When Saad died in 1927, Egypt no longer had an independence movement, and formally became a British dependency. The so-called independence was just an empty name.

### Money and Banking Industry Temporarily Suspends Loans Secured by Commodities to Prevent Hoarding; Tax to be Levied on Warehouse Stockpiles Starting This Month

The various banks and firms of the Money and Banking Industry Association have jointly decided that, in order to prevent the use of commodity-secured financing to encourage hoarding and speculation, the acceptance of loans secured by commodities will be temporarily suspended. As for overdrafts secured by commodities, the various banks and firms will handle them at their discretion. This "secured overdraft" is short-term in nature, and the interest rate will be calculated by the various firms based on the overdue interest market rate announced by the association at the end of each month. The various banks will determine their own rates with reference to market conditions, but the various industries are limited to their own commodities for "secured overdrafts." Daily necessities may not be requested for financing. The various banks and firms have complied with the above measures.

### Notice on Implementation of Tax on Stockpiled Goods

The Money and Banking Industry Association yesterday issued a notice to its member banks and firms that the issue of taxing warehouse stockpiles as a temporary profit-making enterprise, if there are any gains, should be taxed in accordance with the regulations. This matter has been submitted to the committee for discussion and approved. All banks and firms engaged in warehouse business should, starting in July, have the warehouse managers list the type and quantity of goods, the date of entry and exit, and the name of the owner, for verification and taxation in accordance with the law. This report is required once every ten days, and is relatively simple and easy to complete within the above scope.

### Increase Interest Rates to Prevent Hoarding

In order to prevent encouraging speculation and hoarding, various banks and firms have implemented higher interest rates on deposits and loans. All loans and fixed-term and current deposits of banks and money shops are related to the business of the various banks and firms, and it has been decided that they will be handled at their discretion with reference to market conditions. The daily morning and afternoon interbank rates in the money market have been increased to 20 cents, which is 6% per month. The overdue interest market rate for remittance firms has also been increased. The interbank rate and overdue interest for July, as decided by the executive committee of the Money Industry Association the other day, is 28 yuan for overdue interest and 5 yuan for deposit interest.

The International Red Cross provides subsidies to various charitable organizations. Recently, the Shanghai Three Religions Moral Benevolent Society's second phase of applications for assistance to the hidden poor was recognized by the IRC, which views assistance to the hidden poor as a social problem worthy of attention. Therefore, the IRC has continued to provide a subsidy of 100 bags of rice to ensure that this effort continues uninterrupted.

### Forty Cases Discovered Daily; Cholera Epidemic Becoming More Rampant; Hongkou and Zhabei Begin Checking Vaccination Certificates; Do Not Drink Unclean Water

The English-language "The Shanghai Times" reports that, at a time when the cholera epidemic is rampant, with an average of forty cases being discovered daily, the major locations guarded by Japanese sentries in Shanghai have decided to inspect the vaccination certificates of passersby. This measure will first be implemented in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas, until the public has a thorough understanding of epidemic prevention. When checking certificates, those who do not have a vaccination certificate will not be allowed to pass.

### Cholera Cases Increasing Daily

According to reports from "The Shanghai Times" reporter on the 24th, Shanghai area authorities are receiving an increasing number of epidemic reports. The number of cases is less in the two settlements than in the Chinese area. According to statistics, the average number of cholera cases discovered daily in Shanghai is now as high as forty. According to informed sources, the French Concession currently reports an average of four to six cholera cases per day, which proves the wide spread of cholera. Since July, the French Concession has reported 66 Chinese people infected with the epidemic, of whom 10 have died. No foreign residents have been infected with the epidemic.

### Total Number of Infections Reaches 300

The Public Concession has no accurate reports from surveys, but according to official sources, the spread of cholera is increasing. As of yesterday, the total number of infections in the city has reached 300, according to reports from the Nanshi and other Chinese areas. Health officials say this is entirely due to the negligence of most Chinese residents, who use unclean water for drinking and washing. Since the water often contains germs, it is extremely easy to spread the disease if hygiene rules are not followed.

### Shanghai Western District Coolies Reportedly Rescued

Since the cholera epidemic broke out in this city, although the health authorities have worked hard to inject vaccines for prevention, the residents' diet and living habits do not pay attention to hygiene, resulting in the discovery of genuine cholera cases. According to inquiries at the Second Hospital of the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital at 47A, Great Western Road, Tang Weixin, male, 33 years old, resident of No. 6, Xujiahui; Li Hongbo, male, 12 years old, resident of Carriage Shed, Haig Road; and Luo Shanchang, male, 9 years old, resident of No. 34, Houjiazhai, were all diagnosed as genuine cholera after examination. Fortunately, the treatment was early and the recovery was good. It is hoped that residents will drink less unclean drinks from the streets. If cholera symptoms occur, it is advisable to send them to the hospital quickly.

### Sun Peizhang Dies in Custody

Sun Peizhang, a native of Jiangbei, 23 years old this year, was arrested in the French Concession two years ago for a political case and detained in the French Police Department. Recently, he fell ill in custody and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died on the day before yesterday. The police department sent the body to the mortuary for examination. Yesterday, the charitable hall prepared the body for burial, waiting for family members to claim it.

### Mei Lanfang Cables Itinerary

The news of Dr. Mei Lanfang, who lives in the south and has been separated from the Shanghai people for a long time, is of great concern to all circles. According to Mei's friends in Shanghai, who received Mei's cable last night, "I will arrive in Shanghai from Guangzhou on the 26th, around 1 p.m." Mei's family and friends will go to meet him at that time. It is expected that if the weather along the way is good today, people from all walks of life will be able to reunite with Mei.

### British and American Nationals Provide Large-Scale Assistance to Prisoners of War

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reports that the International Red Cross at No. 17 Yuanmingyuan Road transported 15 bags of a large number of items and letters by a large truck across the Suzhou River this morning (25th) and delivered them to the British and American prisoners of war here. The quantity was huge, exceeding the previous several times. The heaviest item was 1,800 pounds of tomatoes donated by the British Nationals Association, as well as hundreds of copies of the Bible. Other items included meat and ping-pong tables. The Dutch nationals also donated a large number of items, including 7,400 boxes of cigarettes, sanitary products, clothes, food and gramophone records. The American Nationals Association donated hygiene and sports equipment, 15 baskets of tomatoes and many other items, all of which were delivered to the detention camp by the Japanese authorities, as was the case in previous occasions. It is expected that the Red Cross will receive the next batch of mail from British and American prisoners of war early next week. Each prisoner of war is allowed to send one letter and two postcards every three months.

### Movie Theater Employees' Treatment Resolved; Stored Value Coupons to Be Issued Starting Next Month

Since the currency reform, the owners of movie theaters in this city have still calculated the wages of their employees at the original exchange rate of three to one. The employees of the industry requested the theater owners to fully pay wages, commodity subsidies, and housing allowances in Central Reserve Bank currency without success, and jointly requested the trade union of the industry to transfer and mediate. The management also sympathized with the difficult living conditions of the employees, and the negotiations were quite satisfactory and have been completely resolved. Starting in July, the management will pay in Central Reserve Bank currency at a ratio of 85%, and all treatments will be paid in Central Reserve Bank currency from September.

### Sichuan Road YMCA Continues to Hold Nutrition Exhibition

Allied News Agency News: The Japanese authorities have decided that from August 1st, people who pick up and drop off passengers will be prohibited from entering the wharf.

Those who enter and exit due to unavoidable reasons such as escorting the elderly, children, and the sick must first obtain permission from the military police. Therefore, passengers should pay attention to carrying luggage between the wharf (Yangshupu Road) and the ship. Only personal luggage that can be carried is allowed. The remaining items should be transported by the transportation company to avoid people from entering and exiting the wharf.

### Dasheng and Xinsheng Silk Factories All Employees Donate to Education Greatly Hope Industrial and Commercial Circles Follow Suit This Newspaper's Fundraising Goal Should Be Quickly Achieved

This newspaper's third reader scholarship fund has gratefully received a donation from the Dasheng and Xinsheng silk groups. The Dasheng factory, Song Baolin, and Yang Weiqun each donated 500 yuan, and the remaining 132 male and female employees (list omitted) each donated from half a yuan to 20 yuan, totaling 500 yuan, for a total of 2,000 yuan. The gentlemen of the factory have all done their best to support impoverished students. This spirit is extremely commendable. It is greatly hoped that industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai will follow suit. With the strength of the group, accumulating small amounts into large sums, this newspaper's predetermined amount for the scholarship fund can be easily raised. Dr. Yu Liren donated 65 yuan, the entire proceeds from his July 23rd clinic appointments, to the scholarship fund, which is greatly appreciated. Furthermore, Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company's slogan contest for "Sheng Sheng Milk" did not produce a suitable pairing and was difficult to judge. The original prize money of 250 yuan has been transferred to this newspaper's scholarship fund and the Xinwenbao loan fund. We thank them on behalf of the impoverished students.

Letters from the Two Factories

A letter from all the employees of Dasheng and Xinsheng Silk Factories stated: "To the gentlemen of the scholarship committee of the Shenbao: In these times of great difficulty, the people are struggling to survive, and yet you, gentlemen, possess both benevolence and wisdom, and continue to care about education. You are appealing to the compatriots for assistance for poor children, cultivating the foundation of the nation for the future, and creating happiness for the people from the beginning. Unless one is made of wood or stone, how could one not be inspired and rise up? We and others are engaged in the silk industry, and our businesses are declining, making it difficult to make ends meet. We are ashamed that we have the desire to do good but lack the strength to provide relief. After being moved to action, we have all done our best to gather storage bills for 2,000 gold, which we are sending to your office to express our humble sincerity. Although this is a drop in the bucket, it is not enough for a major plan, but collecting fur can make a robe, which is always more and more beneficial. Attached is a list of donations, which we pray you will transcribe immediately to show the reality. Wishing you a pleasant summer."

Scholarships Received Yesterday

The following scholarships were received yesterday, and their congratulatory titles are recorded below: All employees of Dasheng and Xinsheng Silk Factories: 2,000 yuan; Renhoutang: 500 yuan; Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company (cancellation of the Sheng Sheng Milk slogan contest's original prize money): 125 yuan; Xingji: 100 yuan; Yu Liren: 65 yuan; Hengfengchang Artificial Silk Company: 50 yuan; Fodecun: 10 yuan; Lizheng Bookstore: 5 yuan. The above totals Central Reserve Notes 2,855 yuan. Previous balance: 80,610 yuan and 54 cents. Total balance: 83,465 yuan and 54 cents.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Employees Considering Salary Increase

The English "Times" newspaper stated, "The Board of Directors of the Public Concession is currently studying the issue of salary increases for employees. The motivation for this salary increase is to enable employees to maintain their current standard of living and to strengthen policing capabilities. It is understood that since last November, prices have increased by approximately 50%, while the salaries of Municipal Council employees have been reduced twice in January and February of this year. At the same time, it is also understood that while reducing employee salaries to save expenses, new taxes have also been added to cover a portion of the annual budget expenditure of one million yuan for usual expenses. It is expected that a surplus of 30% can be obtained. It is said that this 30% will not be used for other purposes but will be used to compensate for the loss of the 50% increase in prices from November to January last year. This 30% surplus will be distributed to all 6,000 Municipal Council employees, regardless of whether they are nationals of countries at war with Japan. At the same time, the salaries of Japanese Municipal Council employees, whose daily expenses are all denominated in military scrip, will also be increased by 30% calculated in military scrip."

### Fire on Xujiahui Road Destroys Five Bungalows

Five bungalows without numbers in Lane 817, Xujiahui Road, in the French Concession, suddenly caught fire at approximately 9:16 p.m. last night. Thick smoke filled the air. The fire brigade rushed to the scene with pumps and fought the fire until 11:10 p.m., when it was finally extinguished. All five bungalows were reduced to ashes. It is understood that the first household, surnamed Che, was a police officer; the second household, named Ding Shaohua, was a clerk in the French Municipal Council; the third household, named Xu Luogui; the fourth household, named Chen Yongtai, was in the iron business; and the fifth household, named Shen Lianzhou. Afterwards, their wives wailed and their children cried, extremely miserable. Fortunately, no one was injured.

### Strict Order to Boil Water Sold by Cooked Water Vendors

The local Cooked Water Vendors' Association has recently discussed concrete measures to punish member vendors who do not sell cooked water at the limited price, in order to unify prices and prevent disputes. As for the cooked water sold by each store, it must be boiled. An emergency meeting was convened to strictly order compliance. Currently, members of the investigation section are secretly investigating in various districts. If it is discovered that boiled water is not being sold, the store number will be recorded and reported to the guidance section, which will summon the store owner for severe punishment. Therefore, the sale of water by the industry may be expected to improve in the future, in order to prevent users from spreading epidemics.

### Announcement of Fourth-Term Grain Sales Prices Stored Rice Mixed for Sale Two New Rice Shops to Be Added West of Hongqiao Railway

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the validity period of the third-series rice purchase certificate for purchasing Bureau rice and flour ends on the 25th of this month and will be invalid after the expiration date. During the period from the 27th of this month to August 1st, each rice shop and the Bureau's rice distribution point will only issue Bureau rice and flour based on the fourth-series rice purchase certificate. At that time, each certificate will be used by the rice shop with the registration number indicated on the certificate to issue 1.5 sheng of white rice at a price of 3.8 yuan. At the same time, the rice purchaser may purchase 1.5 jin of flour at a price of 3.4 yuan. Whether or not to purchase flour should be at their discretion and should not be compulsory.

### Total Amount of Rice Distributed Reduced

According to a Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, the number of bags of white rice received by rice shops in the two concessions this time is less than in the previous period, while the amount sold per person is still 1.5 sheng. The reason is that the rice shops have a considerable amount of household rice left over from the previous period, which is mixed for sale, so it will not be insufficient. As for the addition of two new rice shops in the area west of the Hongqiao Railway, the site is still under investigation.

### Li Weining's Concert Leading the Shanghai Music Scene

The Shanghai music scene, under the leadership of Li Weining's regular concerts, has suddenly become prosperous and flourishing. Although Mr. Li's concerts have only been held three times, their impact on general music lovers—especially those studying music—is truly significant.

### Praised by Knowledgeable Celebrities

Professor Erbo, a well-known music critic from Vienna, recently wrote about Mr. Li's music in a German newspaper, saying: "Li Weining's concerts, which he founded for his countrymen, are not only interesting. He is not only a composer and music professor, but he also passionately promotes Western music in the Far East. He introduces musical masterpieces in such a careful and systematic manner that his efforts are bound to succeed. Li Weining's piano playing is perfect, and his own works are equally popular. His 'Remembering My Deceased Mother' introduces a melancholy and evocative atmosphere between the prelude and postlude. The form is not purely song-like but tends towards a solemn, deeply sworn-like recital style. The whole piece poses more questions than it resolves, and its emotions are more than the shape of Bach's music. In the piece 'Before the City Gate,' he runs even further. His musical tone seems close to Puccini or perhaps close to the current song style. Even a musician as accomplished as Mr. Li would find it difficult to build a musical bridge between the Far East and Far Europe." In addition, a French newspaper once criticized, saying, "Li Weining's last concert was more carefully prepared and more progressive than the first few."

### Recent Developments in the Divisions of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music

It is easy to think of the National Conservatory of Music producing many talents and achieving remarkable results. The most notable include the piano master Yin Halohua, Wu Leyi, the theoretical composer He Luting, Qian Renkang, the vocal music experts Hu Ran, Si Yigui, Lang Yuxiu, the wind instrument expert Ye Huaide, Xia Hanxing, and the pipa expert Tan Xiaolin: all graduated from the school, just like Mr. Ding Shande, who is famous for opening the "Shanghai Music Hall" (now renamed Shanghai Conservatory of Music)! His facility is what people interested in music want to know. Acting Principal Li Weining is actively reorganizing the school and reforming the old academic system.

The Normal Department is Abolished The Conservatory of Music is dedicated to cultivating specialized music talent, so there is no need to set up the Normal Department and Teacher's College, which would also be uneconomical.

Adding a Preparatory Course The level of an independent college is equivalent to that of a university. Since the Conservatory of Music needs to improve the standard of musical technique, it is necessary to add a preparatory course, which is necessary as preparation for the undergraduate course.

Revising the Elective Course Regulations Most of the major conservatories of music in Germany, Austria, and France have elective students. Although they study at other schools or work elsewhere, they still have the opportunity to study music; however, the main course they choose must have a special talent to be admitted. Children can also apply for the exam, so on the one hand, they can obtain a solid foundation in the Conservatory of Music, and on the other hand, they can study in other primary and secondary schools at the same time. After graduating from the Conservatory of Music, they will not become mere "musicians" or "instrument players" but complete musicians.

### Mr. Shou Ding Fubao

Very Frugal and Happy to Help Others

A special typical figure must have a special personality. However, nothing in the world is more difficult to understand than each person's personality, and the more special the type, the more difficult it is to understand the personality. Mr. Ding is certainly no exception. Someone said: "Mr. Ding's personality, in the words of a psychologist, seems to be 50% neurotic, 30% choleric, 20% sanguine, and not much phlegmatic. If we ask a doctor to examine him, his blood type is guaranteed not to be type B, but type A, because people with type B blood are generally simpler and more rough in temperament. How refined and calm is he? How gentle and understanding is he? How could there be a trace of type B blood cells in his blood?"

That being said, Mr. Ding must have been a child prodigy, but he wasn't. In his own words: "I started attending private school at the age of seven, and I knew about a thousand characters. When I read the Great Learning, I could only read three lines a day, and I couldn't even recite them. My father then ordered me to read books upstairs, and my mother was responsible for supervising my studies. On the first day of reading the Great Learning, tears fell like rain, and the books I read were completely wet. I held bamboo chopsticks in my right hand and pointed to them, and the bamboo chopsticks were completely broken. I used scraps of paper to repair it, and glued it with rice grains, but soon the paper was crumpled." It can be seen that he must have been a naughty, crying child who didn't want to study when he was young. At the age of nine, people said that he was a dirty child, "In July of that year, one afternoon, I was playing in the Gu Taihe clothing store. I saw a butterfly perched on a melon rind in a urinal in the back garden. I did not avoid the dirt and used a fan to swat it. Gu's family saw it and scolded me, saying, 'This child is so decent, but he is so dirty.' I was very angry when I heard this, and I ran out quickly and did not go to Gu's house for months."

Mr. Ding has a very strong personality. He does not admire hypocrisy, does not pursue fame and fortune, does not like social engagements, does not invite guests, and is not easily invited as a guest. He is very frugal with himself, but he is not stingy and is happy to help others. He used to not install a telephone to reduce socializing, and he did not take a car to maintain frugality and simplicity. In 1932, his second son, Huikang, gave him a new Ford V-8 cylinder umbrella car. A few years later, the Shanghai war broke out, and he donated the car for public use. He is not afraid of difficulties in doing things, does not follow routines perfunctorily, and does not stop until he achieves results. He spent 30 years writing the 66 volumes of the Shuowen Jiezi Gu Lin, which is a manifestation of this spirit.

Deep Deliberation and Careful Use of Mind in Handling Matters

In his self-written chronicle, he once described himself.

"When I was eighteen or nineteen years old, in my spare time from studying the Confucian classics and history, I liked to read Zhu Zi's Elementary Learning, Reflections on Things at Hand, and Five Rules of Conduct. I was very strict with myself. I often said that if I succeeded, I would be a famous minister, and if I failed, I would be a Confucian."

"I think I am dull and clumsy by nature, so I get up before the cock crows every day to read books and do things. There is a regular class every day. This is to abide by the training of diligence to make up for my clumsiness."

"I dare not even do any of the frivolous and extravagant things in the world, as well as the exciting and magnificent feats. I am conscientious and cautious, and I abide by the norms of a poor scholar. This has been the case for decades."

"Can you wear coarse clothes and eat simple food? Can you not take other people's extra money? If you are uneasy in your heart, can you not tell others about things? Can you not be a slave to wealth and desires? Can you really be honest in your words and deeds and not be ashamed in the clear night? Alas! Can you look at yourself and see if you are a gentleman or a villain? Changli said, 'If he does not become a gentleman, he will end up being a villain.' It is so obvious. If this is the case, is it not sad?" (Self-written in the small photo)

At the age of thirty-one, he wrote his own motto: "Treat people with kindness and generosity, with pure and sincere feelings, handle matters with deep deliberation and without revealing, and use your mind carefully." "When doing things, you should be firm, courageous, and resolute. In the midst of thousands of hardships and obstacles, you must not allow half a difficult word to come out. The more difficult and dangerous, the more soul power I must have to drive them away and achieve my goal." He said that if he succeeded, he would be a famous minister, but he was not interested in an official career. When Yuan Shikai used the name of Confucius to carry out the imperial system, a certain dignitary in Beijing persuaded him to come out of the mountain. He replied with a poem: "I live in an old bridge in Jiangnan, and I entrust my dreams of Chang'an to fishermen and woodcutters. I have no intention of obstructing and drowning, how can I know Confucius? I avoid the world and live in a nest, and I don't know Yao: The martyrs shoot tigers in their old age, and the heroes know the way and are used to playing the flute. I hide my clumsiness in half of my medical skills, and I have never bent my waist for five bushels of rice."

Family Special Issue on Mr. Ding Fubao

### A Few Words

— Ding Fubao

"The achievement of great undertakings lies in a healthy body." Mr. Fubao's works are vast and contribute to academics, all thanks to a healthy life. Now, at the age of seventy, during the hot summer, Mr. Fubao writes for the family section of this newspaper. The articles discuss various aspects of life and healthy living, all of which are his valuable insights. They can serve as a mirror for all sectors of society to exercise and create a happy family. His contribution to society is extremely profound. It is hoped that readers will carefully understand this and not disappoint the deep meaning of this old, young man who is long-lived and helps the world, which is very fortunate. Editor

Shenbao has a history of more than seventy years. In the history of more than seventy years, we often see Xian's brand-new posture, leading the era to move forward, never taking a step back. This is just like a person. He looks like an old man, but he doesn't know that he has the spirit of a young man who is brave and forward-thinking. This is worthy of everyone's admiration. Like me personally, I have always been self-contained and have long been in the ranks of being eliminated. However, I have been blessed by social figures who see that I am 70 years old, my body is strong and healthy, and my spirit is not diminished in my prime. I am really ashamed to be allowed to be an old young man!

Shenbao's family weekly has a large number of readers. The editor puts his whole spirit into irrigating the entire garden. I don't know how many new lives have been transformed for ordinary families. In recent years, the Shenbao Reader Scholarship Movement has been launched to help young people and promote their development. I don't know how much vitality has been cultivated for the country. These two things are even more worthy of our admiration.

August 3 this year is the humble birthday of my passing 69 years. I dare not disturb my relatives and friends in this time of difficult material resources. Moreover, it is my consistent proposition not to celebrate my birthday while I am alive and not to hold a funeral when I die. I have never changed. All my relatives and friends must not be willing to drink a glass of birthday wine for me. I have been loved by my relatives and friends and have set a memorial method for me, converting all birthday gifts into cash and sending them directly to the Shenbao Museum to donate to the scholarship fund. On the one hand, it increases the strength of the scholarship, and on the other hand, it benefits relatives and friends. I feel that this method cannot but deeply thank my relatives and friends for their love for me with virtue.

### My View of Life

— Ding Fubao

In recent times, young men and women have been prosperous, living in a drunken dream, and indulging in games and banquets all day long. This is not enough to talk about a view of life. There are also those who are busy from morning to night, with no time to spare. Supporting their parents and raising their children are all problems. They are confused all year round and are trapped by food and clothing. This is also not enough to talk about a view of life. There are also those who have sufficient food and clothing, but have no purpose in doing things, no honor or disgrace, and waste their lives. When they are buried in a coffin, all things are over. This is also not enough to talk about a view of life. There are those in the world who regard making a fortune as a view of life. When they are alive, they often accumulate wealth to several million, but when they die, their flesh and blood are suspicious, and internal and external conflicts collapse. In a few years, they will disappear. This is the error of taking accumulation of wealth as a view of life. There is also a kind of official fan who regards being an official as the first profession in life. The result is to seek honor but suffer humiliation, and the door can be set up as a bird. There is also a kind of glutton who regards meat as the first enjoyment of life. The result is high blood pressure, kidney inflammation, and hardening of blood vessels, and they often die of cerebral hemorrhage. These people who fail to plan for the long term have all made mistakes in their view of life. I think Buddhism is the most true and noble view of life. I will briefly describe five points as follows: First, for all living beings, they should all be regarded as equal. There should be no ideas of poverty, wealth, nobility, resentment, kinship, height, or inferiority in your heart. Second, I have received this body to save all living beings, so I should devote my whole life to saving society, working hard and dying afterwards. Third, various animals such as shrimps, crabs, chickens, ducks, cattle, sheep, pigs, and dogs should also be regarded as equal. They should not be killed or tried, so they should abstain from killing and release life, and eat vegetables and fruits for the rest of their lives. Fourth, for all living beings who have been rescued, there must be no hope of retribution. All these four points are what the Buddhists call the Bodhi mind. Zhang Zixi Ming said that the people are our compatriots and things are our companions. He also said that all the tired, disabled, lonely, and widowed people in the world are our brothers who are struggling and have no one to tell them. Zixi Ming's saying is also the same as Bodhi's heart. Fifth, resolve to break away from the six paths of reincarnation, you must be brave and diligent, and you must be reborn in the pure land. You must not give up halfway through the goal. This is an active view of life. If it is a negative view of life, it is not enough to talk about this.

### Mr. Ding's Healthy Life

— Huang Zhaoping

Mr. Ding Fubao is seventy years old, strong, energetic, with a ruddy complexion and sparse silver whiskers. He has the appearance of a child's face and white hair. No one believes that such an old man can have such a body.

Mr. has been diligent in his studies throughout his life. Whenever he studies a subject, he will have many brilliant works to display. From the time he was a weak crown until now, he has been writing for fifty years. People in the past praised those who were prolific in their writings as "writings equal to their height." Mr.'s large and small works are no less than one or two hundred kinds. If they were piled up, they would probably be several times his height. No one believes that Mr. would have such energy. Is it that Mr. is blessed by nature, so everything is different from ordinary people? As far as I know, Mr. has really benefited from hygiene throughout his life, so his high-age body has not declined, and his life energy is particularly strong.

In recent years, Mr. has published many books on methods of health and longevity, all of which are his lifelong practical discussions, wanting to guide the world to the realm of benevolence and longevity. Now, I am taking the opportunity of Mr.'s 60th birthday to introduce a little of Mr.'s personal hygiene methods, which is also his healthy life. I think it is not against Mr.'s intention to celebrate his birthday and write books to benefit others.

Mr. gets up at dawn and goes to bed at 9:00 p.m., taking a nap for a while in the afternoon, which he does every day.

He does deep breathing and stretching exercises every morning and evening.

When the weather is clear and there is sunlight, he must take a sunbath.

He opens the windows day and night to keep the air flowing.

He washes his face and rubs his body with cold water all year round.

After the age of forty, he abandoned meat and used only vegetables and fruits to maintain his health.

He does not smoke, does not drink alcohol, and has no unhealthy habits.

He irrigates his intestines once in the morning and once in the evening to clear the accumulated feces in his intestines, and he firmly believes that there is no danger of self-poisoning.

He has moderation in writing books and doing things.

He has a calm and peaceful mind and never gets angry.

The bronze statue of Mr. Ding, given to him by the entire students of the Sculpture Department of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, has a vivid expression and an extraordinary aura.

### The Simplest Way to Health and Longevity

— Ding Fubao

When I was in my twenties, I read the epitaphs and biographies in various literary collections, and often saw people of both character and learning who died before reaching their forties or fifties. I wondered, why would Heaven bestow talents upon them only to cut them short? There were also those who were indispensable talents for the country, who died suddenly at a time when they were being heavily relied upon, causing people endless sighs of regret. After thinking about it, I realized that these people were probably careless in their daily lives, injured by their diet, overworked, and in all ways violated nature, leading to death from illness rather than death from fate. Later, I read Han Shi Waizhuan, which quoted Confucius as saying, "There are three ways people die that are not destined, but self-inflicted: improper living, immoderate eating and drinking, and overwork. These are what diseases kill." Thus, I came to understand that physical decline or frequent illness in youth and middle age, even death from illness, is not fate, but self-inflicted. I have taken Confucius' words as golden rules, and I believe in Ji Kang's saying that "one watering can revive withered plants." Therefore, I have since

At the age of eighteen, on the journey of life, I have been diligent and conscientious, cultivating both body and mind, and daring not to be negligent in the slightest. I have been quite restrained in controlling my sexual desires, abstaining from smoking and alcohol, and eating less meat. Once I stopped eating meat, I completely abstained from it, eating only fruits and vegetables. As a result, all my endocrine glands have been unharmed. I also practice daily sunbathing, deep breathing, and enemas. With no accumulated feces in the intestines, there is naturally no concern about self-intoxication. With no conflicts in my heart, I naturally sleep soundly every night. I dare not indulge in luxury in my housing and clothing, but I also adhere to the middle way, so as not to hinder hygiene. I am extremely cautious about preventing infectious diseases, and fortunately, my resistance is quite strong, so I have not contracted any serious illnesses in the past forty years. I have been treating patients for nearly forty years, and I have seen that the most common disease among young people is tuberculosis, the most common disease after middle age is stroke, and the cause of stroke often lies in syphilis contracted in early years. The most common disease among the elderly is cancer. Therefore, I have studied these four diseases in detail and know what to avoid. If this is done, the physical body can certainly be healthy, but the spirit must be even more sound. Therefore, I have continued to study mental hygiene. There are many previous sayings and actions related to self-cultivation. I have selected and recorded hundreds of them, called "Fragments of Gold," like being in contact with upright and virtuous people for a long time, which can assimilate one to them. However, to go a step further, one must study the ultimate meaning of life, which is where truth lies. This seems to be related to a healthy life thereafter, or perhaps it is one method of healthy longevity.

### Dietary Rules

— Ding Fubao

We should have fixed times for our three meals each day, so that food is easily digested. It is best to have five hours between each meal. For example, it is most appropriate to eat breakfast at 7 am, lunch at noon, and dinner at 5 or 6 pm. If the time between meals is too short, then what was eaten previously has not yet been digested, and another meal is taken, easily leading to indigestion. One should be in a happy mood when eating, as mental happiness makes food easier to digest. If one is mentally depressed or unhappy, digestion will also be affected, making it difficult to digest the food. When eating, one should focus one's mind on the food, savoring its taste, and not eating while thinking about other things, distracted. As the saying goes, "absent-minded, eating without knowing its taste." This bad habit is most likely to harm digestion and should be corrected. When eating, one should chew carefully, which makes it easier to digest. Otherwise, swallowing hurriedly makes it difficult to digest. One should rest slightly after a meal, roughly twenty or thirty minutes of quiet sitting and chatting, so that the mind and body can have a rest. One should not read or bathe immediately after a meal.

One should eat all kinds of vegetables, fruits, and nuts. If one doesn't eat this and doesn't eat that, one will often have nothing to eat. Furthermore, there are some half-baked health experts who only allow children to eat easily digestible foods and dare not let them eat indigestible foods, which harms the development of children's bodies. Being too picky about food will cause the various organs of the whole body to not develop fully.

Young people should especially have a sufficient diet and, at the same time, get plenty of exercise, which can promote digestion, make metabolism vigorous, and allow the bones and muscles of the whole body to fully develop, growing into a strong body, benefiting them throughout their lives.

### Health Exercise Method (5)

The reason why the various organs inside our abdominal cavity can maintain their normal position and perform their proper functions is that they rely on strong muscle and tendon tissue between the ribs and the pelvic bones to support them. If the muscle and tendon tissue is not very healthy, then abdominal ptosis, inguinal hernia, constipation, indigestion, and other diseases related to organ function will easily occur. Therefore, the abdominal area needs exercise even more than the limbs. However, the abdomen is different from the legs and arms. Although the abdomen needs exercise the most, it is the most difficult to exercise due to its location. Mr. Mai, the inventor of the health exercise method, has taken this into consideration and specifically adopted various quite ingenious practice methods to ensure that the complex muscles and tendons surrounding the abdomen can be strengthened through this exercise. For example, the 13th to 17th postures published in this issue are yet another exercise to strengthen all the main muscles and tendons of the abdomen. At the same time, the muscles and tendons of the head and neck will also benefit greatly from this exercise. In the 13th and 14th postures, one should not use too much force at first, but one must use force after becoming more proficient. If it is inconvenient to touch the chin with the knees due to the muscles and tendons, it is okay to change the posture, touching the left shoulder with the knees while the head is located to the right of the knees. Also, when doing the 15th posture, pay attention to stretching the toes and touching the ground with the head when returning to the original position.

(Figures 13 and 14)

Lie flat on the body, with both hands clasped behind the head, raise the head and shoulders, and bring the knees up, trying to touch the chin or right shoulder with the knees. Repeat six times. Remember to count each time the right leg returns to its original position as one time. In the 14th posture, simply replace the right leg with the left leg, and the rest of the movements are the same.

(Figure 15)

Lie flat on the body, with both hands clasped behind the head, raise the head and shoulders, and bring both knees up, trying to touch the lower abdomen with the knees. Repeat six times. Remember to count each time both legs return to their original position as one time.

(Figures 16 and 17)

Lie flat on the body, with both hands placed on the waist, palms down, raise both legs together, the knees must not be bent, the toes must be stretched, and close both legs to the left, thinking, it must be turned into a complete circle without touching the ground. Repeat six times. Remember to count each time it is turned into a complete circle as one time. In the 17th posture, simply replace turning both legs in a circle to the left with turning them to the right, and the rest of the methods are the same.

### Replies to Letters Regarding Health Exercises

1.  The phrase "first expand the abdomen and then flatten it" in the explanation of Figure 2 means using the expansion and contraction of the abdomen to allow the weight placed on it to rise first and then fall, not "pressing the book tightly against the abdomen" as stated in the letter.

2.  The movements of Figure 3 and Figure 4 are exactly the same, and it is also the same that the hands and heels should not touch the ground when returning to the original position. The only difference is that Figure 3 uses the right hand and left foot, while Figure 4 uses the left hand and right foot.

3.  Yes, the phrase "replace with the left leg and right arm" in the explanation of Figure 5 means "alternate" as stated in the letter.

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Recently, the true cholera epidemic has posed a great threat to us. It is said that raw fish is partly responsible for the spread of the bacteria, so the authorities are considering banning the sale of raw fish. Although raw fish has not disappeared from the vegetable market, we should eat less of it for prevention. Fortunately, those who love the taste of fish can also use salted fish and pickled fish as substitutes even if they don't eat fresh fish, such as salted ribbonfish, salted yellow croaker, pickled grass carp, pickled carp, and dried light fish. As long as they are cooked properly, they are still delicious. In addition, eggs, duck eggs, dried scallops, dried shrimp, etc., can also replace the position of fresh fish on the dining table.

### After Many Days of Latency, the Public Debt Situation Gradually Improves

The public debt market has been rising in the black market, following the alternate changes in the market situation from the previous day. The momentum is gradually gaining strength. It is likely that many of the floating long positions have been settled in recent days. The remaining positions, except for those of large investors who remain unmoved, are more determined and unwilling to follow the trend. Therefore, once there are new buyers, the market price easily surges. This is also a reactive movement that should occur after many days of revolving accumulation and prolonged stagnation. Yesterday, Xinhuahao suddenly had a large demand, and Tongli on behalf of the financial industry also collected with considerable strength. Dazhong, Qianyi, and Wuhe also had demand. Jiufeng covered short positions, driving the price higher. Although Hongda, Renkang, as well as Rutongkang and Lianhe sold off a lot, the market has already seen demand exceeding supply, and the market price is rising sharply. The future trend seems to have remaining upward potential. As a result of yesterday's market price, all rose by one yuan and one jiao to one yuan and seven jiao. The transaction volume was about 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### Chinese Stock Awaits Opportunity to Move

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation saw more declines than gains. According to investors from all parties, the mood has turned tired and is awaiting an opportunity to move. Among the department stores, New Shanghai Co. suddenly became brisk, rising from 130 yuan to 137.5 yuan. Buyers were very active. China Underwear is temporarily suspended from trading during the registration of shares and transfer period. Trading will resume as usual next Monday. Shanghai Cotton Wool turned around at the 20 yuan mark, rising by 7.5 jiao, and the situation is also good. Among the cultural stocks, Commercial Press alone rose by 5 yuan, finally at 295 yuan. Zhonghua and Shijie reduced by 5 yuan to 2.5 yuan, and the momentum turned soft. Dasheng No. 3 Factory rose another 8 yuan, reaching a high price of 250 yuan.

### Woolen Industry Sunning for Mold During Summer Break

The woolen business has been quiet in both retail and wholesale recently. Because of the hot weather during the summer, it has been a clearance period in past years. Moreover, this year, due to the environmental situation, the situation is even more quiet. The prices of various goods have also shrunk and decreased accordingly. Currently, large and small companies and Western clothing tailoring shops have successively taken advantage of the summer break to sun their goods for mold and brush up various items, adding camphor to prevent insects.

### Jewelry Gold Up 50 Yuan

In the local jewelry industry, the Dasing Guild's jewelry gold exchange price was initially listed at 2,250 yuan per tael, rising by 50 yuan at 10 o'clock, totaling 2,300 yuan (inward deduction of more than 300 yuan). The inter-trade trading price also rose to over 2,000 yuan. Some groups, in order to meet retail exchange demand, came to redeem, with prices rising from around 1,955 yuan to 2,050 yuan per tael.

### Bean Sales Revive, Wheat Bran Near the Countryside is Being Handled

Bean Market Conditions: Yesterday, tea beans moved again due to local sales, and the market situation was strong. The remaining transactions were scarce and the prices were flat. The tally included more than 200 bags of Tianjin and Qingdao mung beans, with prices all between 226 yuan and 228 yuan, and 30 bags of Chongming Sand Silkworms, with a price of 109 yuan.

The wheat bran market is still suffering from an excess of demand over supply. Yesterday, the countryside gang handled 400 bags of Sanxin small package wheat bran May pier orders, with a price of 100 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to before.

### Cigarettes Focus on New Goods

The cigarette market suddenly turned sharply higher, with British and American goods taking a unique advantage. The reason is that prices have been severely depressed recently, arousing the favor of general hoarders. However, only new goods meet the taste, and old goods are hard to compare. Yesterday, the market saw prices such as Great Britain at 8,600 yuan per case, Old Knife Brand at 5,400 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 4,700 yuan, Fairy Brand at 3,650 yuan, and Wuhua Brand at 3,350 yuan, all soaring by 500 yuan to 300 yuan.

### Sugar Prices are Too High, Candied Dates Are Selling at High Prices

Candied date sales are selling at high prices due to the high cost of sugar. Now, during the transition between new and old products, there is not much inventory in the market, so the current market price for Zhuang dates is 520 to 530 yuan. The next best, due to being processed with oil and sunned, is priced at 450 yuan due to the poor color, and there are few buyers. This year's new products, due to the high cost of sugar, may not be easy to relax.

### Fish Maw More Expensive at Higher Grades

Fish maw is extraordinarily strong due to both arrival and inventory shortages. The prices of higher grades are even more expensive. For example, Moon Maw has now reached 3,500 yuan in the market, up three-sevenths. Dried cuttlefish is 2,800 yuan, up four-tenths. Others such as Longjiao are 2,500 yuan, and Yupian is 2,000 yuan, with a smaller increase.

### Fennel Not Intending to Sell Quickly

Fennel sales have slightly moved recently, and the market situation is firm. Because the arrival of goods is lacking and the market inventory is not plentiful, those holding goods are confident and unwilling to quickly sell them cheaply. Yesterday's market saw particularly high prices of 1,050 yuan, second at 1,000 yuan, and generally within the 1,000 yuan mark.

### Sago Sees New High Prices

Sago is one of the products of cornstarch, and it is needed at banquets. It is also fine as a common dessert. Because the bottom of the goods is gradually lacking, the price has risen sharply. Yesterday's market saw small-grain sago selling for 1,400 yuan and large-grain for 500 yuan, both being unprecedented high prices.
