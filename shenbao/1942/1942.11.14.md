### Key Points of Military Strategy in North Africa: French Forces Still Resisting; US Forces Occupy the Coastal Port of Bona; Axis Naval and Air Forces Engage in Fierce Battles with British and American Forces

Lisbon, 13th (Allied News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Algiers, US forces have landed in Bona, a port located east of Algiers, approximately fifty miles from the Tunisian border.

Vichy, 12th (Havas) - American troops, leveraging their superior armaments and numerous personnel, continued their advance yesterday in Morocco and Algeria, despite resolute resistance from French forces. Although the British Broadcasting Corporation announced yesterday that French forces in North Africa had ceased resistance, it was forced to admit today that "in certain key strategic points, French forces are still resisting." A summary of the situation is as follows: (1) In Morocco, the situation for the defending forces is increasingly dire. Marrakesh has become the center of French resistance and has been subjected to intense enemy air raids. In Casablanca, Rear Admiral Michelier, the commander of the fortress, requested a ceasefire after the defending forces had expended their last ammunition. Furthermore, the port's water supply had been cut off, leaving the population without water. All French warships in the port were destroyed during the fighting. After the ceasefire, the remnants of the French forces retreated to the southeast for reorganization. (2) In Algeria, the port of Bona, east of Algiers, was occupied by US forces this morning. As of 6:30 PM today, the city and suburbs of Constantine are calm. A telegram from the local administration stated, "We are prepared to face any eventuality. We admire the bravery of our troops fighting in Oran. We will continue to be loyal to Marshal Pétain and uphold the traditions of France, uniting for the sake of a strong and unified nation." (3) In Tunisia, the situation remains calm throughout the region. No locations have been attacked. The people are closely watching the development of the political situation in France and North Africa with deep anxiety, but order is maintained. Work proceeds as usual during the day, but as soon as shops and government offices close, residents return home, and the streets become deserted. An air raid alert was issued at midnight today, but no enemy aircraft appeared, and the alert was lifted after twenty minutes.

Vichy, 13th (Havas) - General Noguès, Governor-General of French Morocco, has arrived in Algiers by plane and will conduct negotiations with American officers.

Berlin, 12th (Havas) - German military sources announced today that Axis naval and air forces engaged in fierce battles with British and American fleets off the coast of Algeria in North Africa yesterday, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Five large troop transports, totaling 52,627 tons, were sunk, and four others, totaling 54,000 tons, were destroyed. Another eight ships, totaling 93,000 tons, were also heavily damaged and cannot be reused without extensive repairs. Enemy naval losses include one cruiser sunk, one heavy cruiser and one aircraft carrier damaged, and two destroyers destroyed. In total, the British and Americans lost 200,000 tons of shipping, in addition to the previously announced one aircraft carrier, one heavy cruiser, five cruisers, and one destroyer. The American fleet suffered particularly heavy losses in the Battle of Bougie Bay.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, Allied Command announced that Allied bomber squadrons attacked airfields near Tunis today, and US forces are continuing their advance into Tunisia.

Lisbon, 13th (Allied News Agency) - US Secretary of War Henry Stimson told reporters yesterday that the German side was aware of the Allied plan to invade French Africa beforehand. A large contingent of German submarines was lying in wait for our forces en route to North Africa. The German and Italian forces have a total of 500 divisions. The Germans have 40 divisions stationed in France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and 200 divisions on the Soviet front. It would be foolish to underestimate the tasks ahead.

### Broadcast by the Director of the Japanese Information Bureau

Tokyo, 13th (Allied News Agency) - Mr. Koichi Hori, the third director of the Japanese Information Bureau, delivered a broadcast speech here tonight entitled "The So-Called Counter-Offensive Operations of Britain and America," the gist of which is as follows: Since the Treaty of Versailles, the attitude of Britain and America has been based on the principle of dominating the world and maintaining the status quo. They have completely disregarded the actual circumstances of Japan, Germany, and Italy, which seek survival and development, and have instead engaged in oppression and intimidation to benefit themselves, leading to the current world war. Before this war, Britain and America's tactics towards Japan, Germany, and Italy were to first apply diplomatic pressure, making slight concessions only when necessary. If diplomatic strategies failed, they would not hesitate to go to war. After entering the war, they would launch large-scale offensives with their self-proclaimed military might. When they realized that they could not win in a short period, they would resort to their vast material resources to force the other side into a long-term war in order to subdue them. However, in reality, Britain and America's diplomatic pressure policies have shown cracks. Britain's conspiracy to use diplomatic pressure against Germany ultimately led to the Second European War. Britain and America's scheme to use diplomatic pressure against Japan further led to the breakdown of the Japanese-American talks, ultimately triggering the Greater East Asia War. Their diplomatic pressure tactics having failed, the victory in war that they expected in the second step has also vanished into thin air. At this point, they are loudly proclaiming a long-term war, and the enemy is currently using this as their only propaganda target to boost their discouraged morale. They seem unaware that although Britain and America had abundant material resources before the war, they were largely dependent on overseas sources. After the outbreak of the war, their important resources gradually fell into the hands of Japan, Germany, and Italy, so their so-called long-term war is gradually losing its effect, and the longer the war continues, the more advantageous it becomes for the Axis powers. Britain and America realize that a frontal counter-offensive is impossible, so they are seeking out the weakest points in the Axis powers' forces to implement their so-called counter-offensives, hoping to reverse the decline. The recent movements of American troops in the Solomon Islands and the landings in French territories in Africa, as well as the British military marches in North Africa, are examples of their so-called counter-offensives. However, in the repeated battles in the Solomon Islands, the Japanese navy has inflicted heavy damage on the American forces. Although Roosevelt wants to hide the defeats, he cannot completely conceal the facts, which has led to increasing criticism of the government. Furthermore, Britain, taking advantage of the German-Soviet war, concentrated its main forces and began attacking North Africa from late October, attempting to regain strategic locations to dominate the Mediterranean. It is true that the Axis forces are currently retreating slightly, but General Rommel, who is skilled in mobile warfare, is leading his troops and fighting in close cooperation with the Italian army. As for the American landings in French Africa, it was because the Soviet Union's calls for opening a second front were growing louder. Disregarding the French government's strict neutrality, Britain and America first seized Martinique and New Caledonia, and then illegally invaded Madagascar. Marshal Pétain, unable to tolerate this any longer, resolutely broke off relations with the United States and fully cooperated with Germany and Italy. Germany and Italy sent troops to guard the French Mediterranean coast and dispatched a large number of naval and air forces. Although the British and American forces were fortunate enough to land and fight, it will be difficult for them to maintain their supply lines. We can await the reports of victory from the Axis forces. In East Asia, we are continuously crushing the enemy's counter-offensive attempts, building the foundation for a new order in Greater East Asia, and completing preparations for a long-term war, firmly believing in victory and fighting until we achieve the final victory.

### German Troops Pass Through the Free Zone of France and Arrive at the Spanish Border; Italian Troops Also Enter the Province of Savoy to Take Responsibility for Defending the Mediterranean Coast

Madrid, 13th (Havas) - German troops have now arrived near Arrononia on the Spanish border and have established a patrol station at the French train station of Fuquia Bel. Passenger trains between Spain and France are still running as usual. Long-distance buses between Spain and Switzerland have now been suspended. German troops have also established patrol stations near Fundari along the Franco-Spanish highway. Residents on both sides of the border are very calm. News from Barcelona indicates that everything is quiet and normal, and railway traffic is still unobstructed.

Vichy, 12th (Havas) - Today, German and Italian troops have continuously entered the free zone of France to defend along the Mediterranean coast. The Italian army is responsible for the defense from the Italian border to the Toulon naval port and Corsica. Therefore, the Italian army has entered the province of Savoy. Historically, Nice, Corsica, and Savoy have been objects of Italian desire, intending to place them within the scope of Greater Italy. However, when the Italian army entered the country, they distributed leaflets to the local people, stating that this march was purely for strategic purposes and had no political significance whatsoever. In addition, the German army has also arrived at designated locations for defense, and the passage was peaceful, without any unexpected incidents. Rumors of disturbances and the arrest of large numbers of civilians are completely fabricated. The French people are following Marshal Pétain's orders and remaining calm in the face of the passage of German and Italian troops.

Rome, 13th (Allied News Agency) - The Italian General Staff announced today that Hitler and Mussolini have ordered their troops not to occupy the Toulon fortress area of France, because the commander of the French Mediterranean Fleet and the commander of the Toulon coastal defense have guaranteed to protect French warships and the Toulon naval base against British and American attacks. Italian and German troops within France and Corsica are now moving into positions according to plan. According to an earlier announcement, Italian troops have occupied Nice and reached the Rhone River. Italian motorized units have entered northern and southern positions in Corsica.

Berlin, 13th (Allied News Agency) - The German High Command announced today that German troops have completely occupied the southern coast of France.

### Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama's Statement Criticizing British and American Actions in North Africa

(Allied News Agency, Local Dispatch) - Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, a spokesman for the Japanese Army, stated at a reception for journalists yesterday that the landing of British and American Allied forces in French North Africa is a clear example of the United States having lost its common sense and composure. He predicted that the British and Americans would soon take similar actions again. The Allied forces risked unfavorable conditions to land in French North Africa, which is sufficient to show that the British and Americans have lost their composure in conducting the war. The British and American forces in North Africa will sooner or later become isolated, just like the Allied forces in India and Australia. This can be predicted in advance. The spokesman further likened the Allied actions in North Africa to a drowning person clinging to a blade of grass, saying that since the United States had lost most of its naval strength in the Pacific naval battles and Australia and India are now isolated, the United States has the psychology of a drowning person and will cling to even a blade of grass. That is why the United States is attempting to land in North Africa. According to the spokesman, the British and American landings in North Africa only increase their enemies, and the warships and merchant ships used by the Allied forces to invade French North Africa will become spoils of war for Axis aircraft and submarines.

### Conference of Japanese Local Governors: Prime Minister Tojo Attends and Delivers an Address

Tokyo, 13th (Allied News Agency) - The gist of Prime Minister Tojo's address at the Conference of Local Governors is as follows: The purpose of this conference is to further simplify administration, effectively implement wartime systems, and demand greater efforts. One year has passed since the start of the Greater East Asia War. Thanks to the prevailing momentum, the bravery and resourcefulness of the army and navy soldiers, and the concerted efforts of 100 million citizens, Japan has reaped unprecedented war results. We have laid the foundation for subduing Britain and America in both political and military strategy. Japan is now fully utilizing this foundation of certain victory and expanding and strengthening it in accordance with the progress of the war, determined to continue the offensive and destroy the enemy. However, even though we are currently in a favorable situation, we must not be complacent for a moment. We must not become complacent due to victory. We must abide by the Emperor's will, unite as one ironclad nation of 100 million citizens, and devote ourselves to prosecuting this great war to the end. Since this summer, the government has been determined to implement administrative simplification, establish the Greater East Asia Ministry, and unify domestic and foreign administration, and has recently completed these procedures and is now putting them into practice. As previously announced, the implementation of administrative simplification, the establishment of the new Greater East Asia Ministry, and the unification of domestic and foreign administration are all aimed at establishing national policy and concentrating all efforts on prosecuting the Greater East Asia War to the end. Regarding the expansion of productivity, Japan is now continuing the unprecedented great task in a vast region and sea area, so the need for military supplies is enormous. As the foundation for this, national defense productivity must undergo a landmark expansion. On the other hand, the enemy, who suffered a major defeat in the initial battles, is relying on resources and productivity to actively plan a counter-offensive. Regarding this matter, Japan will utilize its strategic advantages, leverage the 30-year tradition of offensive spirit, and adhere to the policy of destroying the enemy forces. Therefore, no matter what the situation, we must ensure and strengthen the unwavering conviction of victory and expand our combat power so that we can adopt autonomous measures against the enemy. Currently, the various domestic institutions and operations must focus on rapidly increasing productivity in order to cope with the emergency situation. The government will implement various measures to improve this after the meeting. I hope that you will stand at the forefront and urge the people to rise up, and ensure that the implementation of all measures is carried out without regret in order to maximize production efficiency. Regarding the issue of transportation, the ability to enhance the war depends on the ability to transport, and the ability to transport depends on the maritime transport capacity. In order to increase and maintain the material power needed for the war, we must make every effort to improve transportation efficiency to compensate for the shortage of ships. Therefore, it is extremely important to strengthen fundamental measures for enhancing sea and land transport and to thoroughly implement the focus of transport. This year's rice crop was fortunately abundant, but considering the needs of the entire Greater East Asia region in the coming year, we must not be optimistic. Measures such as encouraging increased food production and offering frugal food are still quite important. Frugality in general materials and other southern constructions have made significant progress due to the efforts of the local military administration. Among them, the development of liquid fuels has made unexpected progress. However, from the perspective of giving priority to military needs, the general public still needs to be thoroughly frugal. All citizens must endure any inconvenience with the will to win, and strive to revitalize domestic industries and simplify life. At the same time, they must increase national savings to cultivate combat power.

However, the nation's determination to fight to the end should not be relaxed, and no sacrifice should be spared. Those present should assist the government in promoting and accelerating production plans. At 9:30, the prefectural governors met with the Emperor, and then resumed the meeting, and decided to discuss proposals from the Planning and Commerce & Industry Ministries in the afternoon.

Africa in the Midst of Changing Circumstances

### The French North Africa That the World Focuses On (5)

The Turmoil of Colonial Empires

A. The Oran Incident and the Break Between Britain and France

As the saying goes, "The heavens have unpredictable winds and clouds," but the changes in the international situation are even more dramatic than the weather. Looking at the various situations in the past two or three years, how many of them were expected? The international situation is changing as fast as lightning strikes, one moment this area changes color, the next moment that sea area changes hands, today here is the sound of music, tomorrow it will become a pile of rubble, not only making it impossible for mapmakers to keep up, making it impossible for international commentators to write, but also making it so that news reporters on the spot send out news one moment, only to have it completely overturned the next. Newspaper editors barely make it to 5:00 AM, receiving the latest news, embedding it in the first page, thinking they have done a great job and can sleep peacefully, but they find out the next day that the situation is completely reversed, and at 5:01 AM a world-shaking event has already occurred, rendering their night's hard work wasted! These days the North African war is in progress, and as for the outcome, we had best not engage in "rash speculation." We will avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, and might as well talk about some past "incidents."

Before June 1940, the relationship between Britain and France was truly as close as glue, even closer than the current relationship between Britain and the United States. But extreme heat inevitably turns cold. After the French army abandoned Paris, the war situation worsened day by day, and finally, under the orchestration of Marshal Pétain and Laval, they sought peace with Germany and Italy. Britain, regardless of whether it had been consulted or not, considered this move a bolt from the blue, and the lover of yesterday became the enemy of today.

The French Resistance government originally regarded North Africa as France's last stronghold, preparing to continue resisting in North Africa after the French mainland fell, as North Africa was more than twice the size of the mainland and rich in resources, so nothing was impossible. Therefore, North Africa had a strong army and air force stationed there, as well as a powerful fleet. But things changed too quickly, and the power of the peace faction overshadowed everything. Britain, fearing that the North African fleet would be seized by Germany and used to attack the British Isles, was understandably terrified, and thus the attack on Oran took place.

On July 3, 1940, a British fleet quietly sailed into the Mediterranean and appeared near the naval base of Oran, off the coast of Djebel Kebir. At that time, the French fleet there had, in accordance with the Franco-German armistice agreement, docked in the port, awaiting further orders. Among the important warships were the battleship "Dunkerque" and the smaller "Strasbourg." After approaching the French ships, the commander of the British fleet issued an ultimatum, demanding that the commander of the French fleet, Vice-Admiral Gensoul, choose between surrendering his ships and scuttling them. Vice-Admiral Gensoul requested instructions from the government. The French government at this time was no longer in control of itself, and could only, in accordance with the armistice agreement, submit the contents of the British ultimatum and the French government's possible response to the German Armistice Commission for a decision. German Führer Hitler, upon learning of this matter, immediately issued a written order: "The French government's request to scuttle its own fleet when it is unable to escape British control should be approved immediately." "Better to be a shattered jade than an intact tile," is Germany's consistent principle. The scuttling of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" by its commander, Captain Langsdorff, after being pursued by British ships, was a similar strategy. The commander of the French fleet, upon receiving instructions from the government, acted accordingly and rejected the British ultimatum. The British ships then opened fire, and the French ships returned fire. Thus, the two largest colonial empires in the world since the mid-nineteenth century engaged in their first fierce clash. As a result, the French suffered heavy losses, and the battleship "Dunkerque" was damaged and ran aground. After venting their anger, the British ships considered their mission accomplished and sailed away.

After the incident, the Pétain government was extremely indignant and asked the U.S. Ambassador to France, William Bullitt, to protest to Britain, but Britain's attitude was very tough. On July 5, the Pétain government announced that the British attack on Oran was "treacherous" and that France would sever relations with it. French aircraft immediately took off and bombed the British-held port of Gibraltar. The rift between Britain and France thus widened to an irreparable extent. On August 9, 1940, the British military authorities in Gibraltar declared Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, as well as the non-occupied zone of France in Europe, to be war zones. From then on, the French North African coast of the Mediterranean became a troubled area. On September 24, 1940, British ships again bombarded the port of Dakar in French West Africa on a large scale, staining that area with the blood of battle as well. After the Dakar incident, the British did not give up their ambition and were constantly spreading rumors. On November 31 of the same year, British and American rumors claimed that German Führer Hitler had demanded the following from French Deputy Prime Minister Laval: (1) France would cede most of African Morocco to Spain, (2) Italy would acquire Tunisia and Algeria, and (3) French naval bases would be used by the Axis powers. This was never confirmed, and France was always willing to remain neutral, but Britain's taking advantage of the situation or deliberately harassing it became increasingly prevalent.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Establishes a "Guild Section" to Liaise with Various Industries and Thoroughly Study Issues Such as the Supply of Materials

The "Guild Section" established by the Shanghai Municipal Council to liaise with various trade associations to facilitate price control and the distribution of materials has now officially begun work. Its initial goal is to communicate the relationship between the authorities and various industries, so that when the industries themselves encounter difficulties, they can directly and frankly appeal to the authorities, so that both officials and merchants can jointly seek solutions.

Assisting Various Industries to Strengthen Cooperation

In the past, various industries have adopted an attitude of distrust toward any price restriction measures taken by the authorities. Now, the establishment of the Guild Section aims to break the traditional prejudices of various industries and gain their trust and understanding. At present, about 40% of the city's trade associations have registered with the Municipal Council. The Guild Section first uses the registration procedure to investigate the actual internal situation of the various trade associations, and then assists the various trade associations to form a systematic organization and obtain the support and cooperation of the stores in the related industries. In other words, the authorities will order the stores to join the related trade associations, making the trade associations the true central organs of the various industries.

Overall Planning for Price Control

In terms of price control, the Guild Section aims to protect the legitimate business of various industries, so it does not want to forcibly suppress prices, but only seeks a price level that is neither too high nor too low under the principle of taking into account both industry and people's livelihood. As for the form of control, it will reverse the past method of putting the cart before the horse, starting with the manufacturers first, then the wholesalers, and then the retailers. In other words, when goods are manufactured, their cost value will be adjusted, and then the retail price will be limited through wholesale.

Fair Distribution of Material Supply

In terms of material allocation, the Guild Section will maintain contact with the relevant authorities and dredge the source of goods, maintain the supply of materials and fair distribution under the conditions permitted by the environment. The Guild Section is now temporarily divided into three sections: application review and supervision, accepting the "applications" of various trade associations, further "reviewing" them, and then "supervising" or guiding the activities of various industries. The specific steps are said to be implemented only after the registration of all trade associations is completed.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Orders Stores to Retain Account Records

The Shanghai Municipal Council must order all partnerships, companies, groups or individuals who operate any kind or nature of goods in the Public Concession to retain the books, sales records, invoices, copies, and stubs issued for the sale of goods, in accordance with the Council's Announcement No. 5847 of April 1 and Announcement No. 5998 of July 13, for at least twelve months from the date of registration or issuance, so that officials formally appointed by the Council can inspect them at any time.

### 500 Tons of Cooking Oil Begins to Be Distributed

Retail Sales Begin on the 16th, Limited to Half a Catty Per Person

The 1,000 tons (20,000 piculs) of ordered goods by the cooking oil wholesalers in this port have now all been agreed upon, and 500 tons (10,000 piculs) of them have been transported to the distribution location. As for the distribution method, it is also decided by the military distribution team. From the day after tomorrow (the 16th), the city's retail stores will resume selling. In order to prevent abuses, the wholesalers have adopted cautious measures, and the amount of oil issued per day is clearly stated. Each retail store starts selling oil at 9:00 AM every day at a prominent place in front of the store. Each person is limited to half a catty. If the retail stores do not follow the rules or reduce the supply, citizens can report to the wholesalers on the 5th floor of the Jinye Building on Sichuan Road and they will be severely punished. Now the wholesaler's announcement price is 7 yuan and 20 cents for raw oil per catty in market price combined with Central Reserve Certificates, 6 yuan and 36 cents for soybean oil, and 6 yuan and 8 cents for rapeseed oil. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the Public Works Bureau will add retail donations.

### Dancing Star Hua Liying Strangulated to Death

Returning Home After Dancing and Meeting a Vicious Hand, the Door Was Locked Tightly and the Case Was Strange

Hua Liying, a woman from Suzhou, 22 years old, used to be a dancer in Hong Kong. She returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong in April of this year. She lived on the second floor and the pavilion of No. 74 Hengmao Lane, Mintini Yin Road, in the French Concession, with a monthly rent of 70 yuan. Hua Liying gave birth to a boy named Meishou in May and hired Hong Dabao (27 years old) from Yangzhou as a wet nurse. Driven by livelihood, Liying joined the MGM Ballroom on Yuqiaqing Road to dance a few months ago, earning as much as 5,000 or 6,000 yuan a month, and had diamond rings and gold jewelry. She returned home after the MGM Ballroom closed last night and went to bed, and the wet nurse and child slept in the pavilion. At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the wet nurse Hong Dabao went to knock on the door, but there was no response for a long time, which was very strange. She then tried to pry open the door and saw Hua Liying strangled to death on the bed with a gray and white floral suit tie. The bedding was extremely messy, indicating that the deceased had struggled with the murderer when she was killed. There was no blood on the bed. The wet nurse was shocked and immediately reported to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate and sent the body to the coroner's office for examination. The case is bizarre, and the police authorities are conducting a strict investigation. It is said that the wet nurse Hong Dabao is a major suspect.

### A Lawyer Named Wang Murdered

Dismembered Body in a Tragic State, the Murderer's Purpose Seems to Be Revenge

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reports that a lawyer named Wang was assassinated late on the night of the 11th in Apartment A2, Saint Paul's Apartments, No. 97 Huanlong Road. He suffered multiple knife wounds to the head and chest, and important organs were also cut off. The corpse was hanging from a clothesline in the bathroom. At about 8:00 AM on the 12th, Wang's servant went to work and saw Wang's bed covered in blood. The furniture in the room was a mess. He looked around and finally found the body in the bathroom. He then called the French Concession police, who arrived at the scene and transferred the body to Guangci Hospital, but he had been dead for a long time. It can be seen that the murderer must have broken into the house and committed the crime in the middle of the night. The police immediately began to investigate the case and prepared to examine the body. According to the initial investigation, Wang seemed to have been stabbed with sharp scissors or a knife by the murderer, and many of the wounds were fatal. The mess in the bedroom showed that Wang was attacked while in bed and struggled desperately with the murderer, but was eventually stabbed to death. The murderer then dragged the body to the bathroom and hung it on the clothesline. It is said that Wang lived alone in the apartment, and his office was also located there. The police believe that the murderer's motive was revenge, which can be corroborated by the fact that the important organs of the corpse were cut off.

In order to facilitate sugar purchase for the food users, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, before the new system of sugar distribution based on population is announced, has temporarily revised the temporary measures starting yesterday, and purchase is based on housing donation tickets and citizen certificates. 86 large retailers are designated to sell sugar based on housing donation tickets, with each household purchasing up to five small bags, totaling 25 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. 527 small retailers are designated to sell sugar based on citizen certificates, with each person limited to 1 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per purchase. The sugar sale time is from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day. Each retailer sells according to one-thirtieth of the October allocation and the previously stored sugar amount. If the quota is full, sales may be stopped early. One guard is stationed at each store to supervise and assist in guiding everything.

Explanation of the Average Distribution Method

The Sugar Industry Cooperative Office explained to reporters from the *Shanghai News* yesterday the method for tenants purchasing sugar. All landlords holding housing donation tickets, after purchasing sugar in accordance with the temporary measures, should distribute it evenly among the entire household population (including subtenants), and must not enjoy it alone. This is the main purpose of the implementation of the temporary measures. If the average distribution is still not enough to meet the actual needs of each household, they may purchase sugar from retail stores for 1 yuan per person each time with their citizen certificates. The so-called housing donation tickets are strictly limited to autumn donation tickets in the Public Concession and Hongkou, Nanshi, Huxi, and Zhabei, and to the combined donation tickets for September and October in the French Concession, with no flexibility.

Coordinating Sugar to Maintain People's Food Supply

The allocation amount of sugar for November has been decided to be 25,000 bags, which will be distributed according to the established method. 70% will be given to Type A food users (retailers selling to food users), totaling 17,500 bags, and 30% will be given to Type B users (restaurants and candy and food stores that need it for business), totaling 7,500 bags, which will be picked up by the Sugar Industry Cooperative Office and temporarily stored in the warehouses under this office, and then coordinated with the various stores in accordance with the original procedures. As for Type A retailers, the amount of sugar sold daily is one-thirtieth of the whole month. In terms of the November allocation, the daily sales amount is approximately 583 bags.

Distribution of Sugar Based on Population Needs to Be Improved Urgently

The method of sugar distribution based on population planned by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office is under study. After being approved by the authorities, it will be implemented from December 1. It is said that the distribution of sugar based on population is planned to stipulate that (1) each head of household will be given 1 catty of sugar per month, and (2) each person under the head of household will be given half a catty of sugar per month, based on the number of people. For example, if a household has a head of household and four other people, they will be able to purchase 3 catties of sugar per month with their sugar purchase certificate. Regarding the method of issuing sugar purchase certificates, cooperation methods have been discussed with the local authorities, and it will be handled in the same way as issuing rice and noodle purchase certificates based on population. As for the current purchase of sugar based on housing donation tickets and citizen certificates, it is a temporary transitional method.

### Increase in Sugar Rationing for This Month

Therefore, the principles have been changed, and it is planned to use rental tax tickets to purchase sugar, and the monthly allocation has been increased by 5,000 bags to 25,000 bags. After the sugar selling methods are gradually improved, the situation of crowding for sugar is expected to be eliminated.

### Jiang Hong to Re-enact Empress Dowager Cixi

— Directly With

After "Cloud Color Xia," the program of the Yiguang Theater Troupe has been roughly decided as Yao Ke's adapted and directed "Grievances in the Qing Palace." "Grievances in the Qing Palace" was performed last summer at the Xuan Palace with great success, especially Jiang Hong's Empress Dowager Cixi, which was unanimously praised. It established her position in the theater world. This time, Yao Ke decided to re-stage "Grievances in the Qing Palace" and invited Jiang Hong to perform the role of Empress Dowager Cixi again.

I happened to meet Jiang Hong and had a short conversation with her:

"I heard that Miss Jiang will re-enact Empress Dowager Cixi. Is that true?" the author asked.

"Yes, and rehearsals have already started. We are rehearsing the first act now," she said with a very excited expression on her face.

"Are all the actors in this re-staging of 'Grievances in the Qing Palace' from the Xuan Palace?"

"No, only me. The rest are new."

"Miss Jiang, what are your thoughts on re-enacting Empress Dowager Cixi this time?" the author asked.

She smiled and replied, "I think Empress Dowager Cixi is a very difficult role to play. Last summer, I performed at the Xuan Palace, and I was very grateful for the support from all walks of life, but I also felt ashamed because I didn't really perform well. This time, Mr. Yao Ke invited me to re-enact the role, and I originally wanted to decline, firstly because I am busy with schoolwork, and secondly because I am afraid that I will not perform well and disappoint those who care for me. However, I couldn't refuse Mr. Yao's request, and many friends also hoped that I would re-enact the role, so I agreed. I don't have any thoughts to say. I just hope that I can study hard and perform better than last time." The expression on her face was very sincere and firm.

### A Brief Account of Wang Xinghua

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

In recent years, Yue opera has become quite popular in Shanghai, and various other local operas have paled in comparison. When talking about Yue opera, everyone knows "Three Flowers and One Juan," and even more know that Wang Xinghua is the best of the "Three Flowers." I have seen Xinghua's plays many times, and her achievements are indeed beyond those of ordinary people. The first time I saw "The Jade Hairpin," it gave me a better impression. Xinghua's appearance is extremely beautiful, somewhat like Wang Xifeng, and somewhat like Xue Yanqin, who was very popular in the past. She is slender and graceful, so she can enhance the beauty of her performances. Most women in ancient Shengxian were short and chubby, but Xinghua stands tall and graceful, so she has the beauty of "a tall and beautiful woman." Xinghua stopped performing at "Laozha" during the summer and has recently settled at the "Shanxi" Grand Theater, scheduled to make her debut today (the 14th). I and Xinghua are from the same hometown and have met once, so I write a few words to celebrate her success.

### Ballad Singing and Storytelling Amateur Gathering News

— Chi Lan

Since the establishment of the Shanghai Zhengxing Ballad Singing and Storytelling Research Society, all members have been full of energy and have been maintaining the society's operations. The president, Mr. Wang Xingzheng, in his spare time, tirelessly tunes the strings, striving for excellence. In addition, Mr. Gao Shuzhai and Mr. Chen Jia chi, who have appeared several times at the Zhang Yuan book venue, are both enthusiastic young people. In addition to their love of art, they are also engaged in charitable fundraising, seeking welfare for Shanghai, which is even more commendable. This time, the Zhengxing Society and the Yinlian Society are cooperating to hold a day of ballad singing and storytelling amateur gatherings. The proceeds will still be donated to charitable organizations. It is now scheduled to be held tomorrow (Sunday) from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM for the daytime session at the Zhang Yuan book venue and the Xinle Palace book venue simultaneously. The night session will be held from 7:30 PM to 10:30 PM at the Zhang Yuan book venue and the Dalu book venue simultaneously. The lineup is quite strong.

The daytime session at the Xinle Palace book venue has Wenwu Xiangqiu, Home, Jade Dragonfly, and Three Smiles. The daytime session at the Dalu book venue has Home, Sui and Tang Dynasties, Three Smiles, and Jade Dragonfly. There are many reasons for this strong lineup in this gathering. The establishment of the Zhengxing Society, the suspension of business by employees due to the birthday of the ancestor, and the enthusiasm of the members for public welfare; and the owners of each book venue are competing to recruit them, but unfortunately the number of members is limited.

### Sharing the Same Boat

Wei Cheng spoke too much, unconsciously becoming so sad and indignant. This gave Huang Long a handle, and he grabbed Wei Cheng's hand and said, "Brother Wei Cheng, you can't make such a fuss! Wei Cheng said, "I really couldn't hold it in, that's why. Brother Huang Long, I've finished what I wanted to say. From now on, you are my advisor, and I have many things to discuss with you. But you have to drink less alcohol. If you drink too much, you can't make your own decisions." Huang Long said, "That's not true. The more alcohol I have in my stomach, the more courage I have. But Brother Wei Cheng's words are good words. I always look at things and do things, and sometimes I listen to you." The two men's conversation was over. In the blink of an eye, it was New Year's Eve. Second Mrs. Ye and Cui Zhen were discussing how to spend the New Year. In the Shide Hall and in the Shuangmei Study, bright red candles were lit, shining directly from the inside out. Today, the usual practice of the door being closed even when it was open was broken. Not only was the main door wide open, but even the fence door was open. Ah Xing, He Zixing, and others had already rubbed their palms, preparing to gamble for fun in the New Year. They heard that Huang Long had run a teahouse, and when it came to gambling, he was the ancestor of gambling. Ah Xing had asked Huang Long, and Huang Long had promised to play with them during the New Year, so they were waiting for the New Year to arrive, waiting for Huang Long to arrive, within the possible range.

Ah Xing and the others were peering inside, but a suspicious person was led in by the yellow dog outside the fence. The guest was carrying a lantern with the words "Something County Zheng Hall" on it. It was impossible to tell what county it was. He was also supporting himself with a stick that looked like neither a walking stick nor a walking stick. He stumbled with every step, and every stumble was followed by a dry cough. Reflected by the candlelight of the coil, Ah Xing and the others recognized Wei Yunqing, and they couldn't help but be surprised. Ah Xing was the first to run inside, shouting as he ran, "Wei Yunqing is here!" With this shout, Wei Yunqing replied outside, "Hey! Don't shout, I'm looking for your Second Mrs. and Young Master." As he spoke, he had already entered the gate. He walked as fast as Ah Xing. He only walked towards the bright lights, only towards the place where there were people in the house. This is how he arrived at the Shuangmei Study. In the room, Second Mrs. Ye and Wei Cheng had both stood up. Wei Yunqing put the stick and the lantern on the table. Then, he took off the blue cloth bag on his shoulder.
