Tokyo, 10th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – As the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War approaches, the large-scale and scheduled reshuffle of five Japanese naval admirals has attracted considerable attention. According to political observers, the most noteworthy aspect of this reshuffle is the change of command for the fleet stationed in China. The new commander, Admiral Zengo Yoshida, resigned from his position as Navy Minister in the Konoe Cabinet due to illness in September of the previous year and was reassigned as a military councillor. During the Sino-Japanese Incident in Showa 12 (1937), Admiral Yoshida was the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet and was active in Chinese waters. After August of Showa 14, he served as Navy Minister in the Abe, Yonai, and Second Konoe Cabinets, displaying his agile skills. He, along with Navy Minister Shimada and Combined Fleet Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto, were all contemporaries. The appointments of Admiral Mineichi Koga as commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, Vice Admiral Ibō Takahashi as commander of the Kure Naval District, and Admiral Soemu Toyoda and Vice Admiral Noboru Hirata as military councillors will further strengthen the Japanese Navy.

### Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Comments on US-France Incident

Allied News Agency, Local Dispatch – Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, spokesman for the Japanese Army Information Department in Shanghai, yesterday hosted foreign news reporters and denounced the US invasion of French Morocco and Algeria as "thug behavior." He stated that the US and Britain have suffered repeated defeats and accusations, and have turned to neutral countries, launching unwarranted attacks on their territories. The Anglo-American invasion closely follows three events that have placed the Allied powers in an extremely unfavorable position: first, the US elections, in which the Republican Party gained a surprising number of seats in Congress, threatening the reign of the "New Deal," indicating that the Roosevelt administration has lost popular support to a dangerous degree, serving as a warning to Roosevelt; second, Stalin delivered a speech in Moscow on the 25th anniversary of the Soviet revolution, strongly criticizing his allies for failing to open a second front; the third development was the naval battle in the South Pacific, in which the US Navy suffered a nearly complete defeat by the Japanese Navy. Australia, the "treasure house of the Anglo-Americans," has realized that it is facing a real danger, and India is in the same situation. These two English-speaking countries have suffered such blows in a short period of time, and their invasion of French Africa is taking place in a very short timeframe. Algeria and Morocco are both territories of neutral France, and the Anglo-American brutality is completely inconsistent with their professed principles of humanity and fairness. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama recalled that when Japan sent friendly troops into French Indochina in June 1940, it was a completely peaceful entry. At that time, the US and Britain did everything possible to promote the view that this entry was an act of aggression against the weak. The spokesperson strongly criticized the inconsistency of the Allied powers' words and deeds, concluding that the Anglo-Americans must be under strong pressure, leading to this act of aggression and violence.

Two American transport ships were hit and caught fire. At 8:00 PM, a large-scale air battle broke out between German and Italian planes and American planes over the coast about fifteen miles west of Algiers. Several planes could be seen falling into the sea from the coast, but their nationalities could not be determined. Later, it was learned that one of them was a German plane. Although the city has been under artillery and aircraft fire in recent days, the damage has not been very great. Only fifteen people have been killed and fifty injured.

### Hitler's Speech - Full Text

(Continued from yesterday's conclusion)

After the end of the German campaign in Poland, a peace proposal was once again put forward, but the enemy refused again. Germany had no choice but to continue fighting. In 1940, Germany proposed peace again, which was also rejected. The enemy regarded the peace proposal as a sign of weakness, and Germany would not propose peace again. The war must be fought to a decisive victory; Germany will never collapse, only the enemy will collapse. Hitler continued, stating that the comrades who fought for power within the country are now also participating in the external war. During the First World War, only two members of parliament were among the 2,000,000 German soldiers who died in battle, while in the current war, as many as thirty-nine members of parliament are among the 350,000 German soldiers who have died. Germany knows well the fate it will face after defeat and will no longer consider compromise. The enemy constantly proclaims that Germany hopes to compromise, merely to encourage its own people. Germany presented its final peace proposal in 1940 and will not make any further peace suggestions. The war will continue to expand, from Europe to the entire world, and Germany will achieve final victory. Although the enemy claims victory, German forces have already fought in the Caucasus. The speed of the advance is truly astonishing. German forces did not launch an offensive on the central part of the Eastern Front this summer. The German goal in the Stalingrad area is to cut off traffic on the Volga River, severing the transportation of 30,000,000 tons of war materials, including 9,000,000 tons of gasoline. Wheat exported from Ukraine and the Kupensk region all passes through that area. The city is a center for shipping. Germany has already controlled the city; Soviet forces only maintain a few strongholds in the city. We will persevere to the end and strive to achieve our goals. If the enemy is currently preparing to launch an offensive, we may as well let them do so, waiting for them to come and meet their doom. Britain and America often say that Germany made a big mistake in fighting in Narvik and Stalingrad, and occupying the Kryvyi Rih mining area in Ukraine and important production centers in southern Russia. This is seemingly plausible but actually wrong. If Britain could seize our country's Ruhr region, the Rhine River, the Danube River, the Elbe River, and Upper Silesia, would they also consider it a big mistake? Regarding the African war, if Britain believes that it has now made progress in Shahana, then it would have made progress in the past, but then retreated. A temporary advance or retreat does not immediately determine the outcome of the war. British and American propaganda often boasts about their military production, especially submarines. Churchill boasted in 1939 and 1940 that the submarine crisis had been resolved and that three to five enemy submarines could be destroyed every day. In reality, we only had a small number of submarines participating in combat at that time; most were training new submarine crews in the country. At that time, very few submarines went out to attack the enemy. It is embarrassing to say now, but the number of new submarine crews being trained domestically was ten times the number of those fighting abroad. We immediately engaged in mass production, and our strength is comparable to that of the United States. The ships we build are even more effective than those of the United States. We have now sunk 24 million tons of enemy ships, which almost exceeds the total of 12 million tons of enemy ships sunk in the last war. At the same time, we are also engaged in building other new military equipment, and whenever old military equipment loses its effectiveness, new military equipment takes its place, thus creating these new victories that change with each passing day. Germany's allies have also contributed to our war effort. As of today, my confidence in the future is greater than ever before. The situation this winter is also better than last year. What happened last year will not happen again today. No matter where the enemy attacks, we will meet them head-on with a severe blow. Regarding the American military's recent invasion of Africa, Roosevelt's excuse was that it was to guard against Germany and Italy. We do not consider it worthwhile to waste much breath refuting this. Since the enemy wants to attack us, we will naturally counterattack in a timely manner. German generals and soldiers will certainly do their utmost for the country. Hitler concluded his speech by saying that our country has nothing to fear regarding raw materials. The raw material areas that we have occupied are sufficient to meet our wartime needs. The factories, railways, and coal mines in the occupied areas have mostly been reorganized and will surely produce an astonishing force by next year. We firmly believe that when peace arrives, the people of Europe will be able to enjoy true happiness. We also believe that after the end of this war, the power of gold will collapse, and we hope that the people will endure the suffering they are currently experiencing. I vow to retaliate against the enemy. Now is the critical moment for our nation to strive for survival. I hope that all men and women in our country will work together.

### Africa in a Changing World - French North Africa in the Global Spotlight (2)

There are not many Berber tribes, and the majority of the population are Arabs who devoutly believe in Islam. They are accustomed to agriculture, industry, and trade, and are hardworking and resilient, unlike the blacks in the equatorial African jungles, who are solely focused on gluttony and laziness, and are devoid of purpose. There is also a type of people called Berbers, who have white skin, but have become blackened due to prolonged exposure to the tropics. Although their race differs from that of the Arabs, their culture has been greatly influenced. They live in stone houses and till the land with wooden hoes. There are also Moors, who are mixed-race descendants of Arabs, Berbers, and Europeans. They are naturally lazy, but their business acumen is extremely high, and they can become brothers with Jews who value money above all else.

Present-day Algeria has become a part of mainland France. In addition to having its own parliament as a political organ, before the armistice, each province also elected three senators and six representatives to participate in the parliament in Paris. According to 1937 statistics, the military garrison in the territory consisted of 3,000 officers, 89,000 soldiers, and an air force of 5,2100 personnel. National conscription was for two years, with those conscripted serving in the reserves during mobilization. The current number of troops is likely to have increased over time, depending on the circumstances. However, after the American forces landed in its capital, Algiers, they signed an armistice with the American forces in less than a day, which shows that its strength is limited, especially with the activities of the pro-De Gaulle faction.

B. Tunisia

France, though satisfied with acquiring Algeria, soon developed further ambitions and, inching forward, shifted its gaze to Tunisia in the east, which no one could stop. Tunisia's climate and people are similar to those of Algeria, but its area is smaller. The country is located on the site of the once mighty Carthaginian Empire, which later became a province of the Roman Empire. To this day, one can still find the ruins of ancient Roman temples and amphitheaters, half-sunken in the yellow sand, for poets to lament, historians to remember, and archaeologists to appreciate, and to imagine how densely populated and beautiful the areas now swept bare by the dry winds of the Sahara Desert once were.

This semi-desert area has a small population and is ruled by a Muslim governor. The natives are content with their lot, working at sunrise and resting at sunset. Although they cannot compare to the people of Getian and Wuhuai, at least they are free from the harassment of cannons and airplanes. By the mid-19th century, which was the era of European imperialist hunting for colonies, this area became meat on the chopping board, unable to escape the tiger's mouth.

European speculators, usurers, merchants, and colonial hunters flocked to Tunisia from 1860 onwards, showing off their knowledge and engaging in deception against the local natives. The local governor welcomed these outside benefactors with open arms. He believed that since they were willing to lend money, at least they did not harbor malicious intentions. However, the reality was the opposite; these usurious loans were more dangerous than poison. Before long, the governor, Sultan, discovered that borrowing money was easy but repaying it was difficult, the national treasury was empty, the debt was piling high, and the court was occupied by many foreigners who had become too powerful to remove.

At that time, the Italians were the most favored in the governor's court, followed by the British. France, being in a favorable geographical position, was ultimately luckier than the other two countries. Later, Britain, knowing that it was difficult to compete, had to give way to France, hinting that if France did not oppose British activities in Cyprus and the Near East, then Britain could turn a blind eye to France's actions in Tunisia. Germany also did not exert itself to oppose it; the only country it refused to let go of was Italy. Thus, a situation of two tigers, France and Italy, fighting each other was formed. In July 1880, a British railway company offered to sell a railway line in Tunisia. This railway was originally worthless, worth at most one million francs. The French side already intended to buy it, and the Italian side also wanted to acquire the railway rights as a basis for further activities. Both sides, for the sake of face, raised the price, and eventually the Italian side paid 4,125,000 francs, four times the price that France was willing to pay, to buy it.

The loss of a mere railway right was not enough to discourage France, and it increased its determination to obtain Tunisia. The month the railway sale was decided, Paris received an urgent border report saying that the Tunisian natives were rioting in the area bordering Algeria, and the situation was serious. By the spring of 1881, the border attacks had escalated to an uncontrollable level. The French government had no choice but to allocate 6 million francs for an expedition to ensure the safety of Algeria. 35,000 French troops then crossed the Algerian border and entered Tunisia to carry out a pacification campaign. Not only did they punish the natives, but they also agreed on four chapters with the governor: (To be continued)

### French Ambassador and Consul-General Hold Talks Yesterday - Believed to be Related to French North Africa - French Chamber of Commerce Forbids British and American Nationals from Entering

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that French Ambassador Cosme and French Consul-General to Shanghai, Magre, held secret talks for over an hour and a half yesterday morning, believed to be related to French North Africa. The talks began at 11:30 a.m. and lasted until about 1:00 p.m., when the two men left the French Ambassador's office together and left by the Ambassador's car for lunch. Magre usually has lunch at his official residence at the French Consulate, but made an exception today. The content of the talks is unknown, as no one was able to approach them and inquire after they began their discussions. It is generally believed that the talks may have discussed possible actions that the French authorities in this city will take against British and American nationals. Other French officials remained silent and refused to comment on any possible actions that the French authorities will take. However, it has been learned that the first private action taken by the French after the American attack on French North Africa was to prohibit American and British nationals from entering the French Chamber of Commerce. According to Anatole, the secretary of the French Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber has already made this decision and has posted a notice to this effect at the entrance of the Chamber. This action was taken by the Chamber privately and is not an official action by the French authorities.

### Check Clearing

Proposed Abolition of Continued Clearing - Periodic Clearing to Imitate the Silver Union Society

The Qianye (Money Exchange) Joint Reserve Bank yesterday notified its members, stating: "To all members: Regarding the check clearing matters of the industry, despite repeated reforms by this bank, a satisfactory result has not been achieved due to various reasons. This bank intends to abolish the original continued clearing system and adopt the Silver Union Society's scheduled clearing system instead, in order to make it simpler. However, as it concerns the benefits and drawbacks to the public, we must solicit opinions from all members. If there are any objections, please submit them in writing within five days, so that this bank can decide whether to implement them. We would also like you to consider the time for clearing (this bank intends to change it to 3:15 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. from Monday to Friday, and 2:00 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. on Saturdays). Please investigate and respond accordingly. The improved clearing methods are listed below: (1) The position of the numbers on the receipt slip for checks received from fellow members must be filled in correctly. For example, the thousands digit should not be biased towards the hundreds digit or tens of thousands digit, and the characters seven and nine must be clear. The other numbers should also be clear. (2) After the receipt slip for checks received has been checked and found to be correct, the clearing seal must be personally stamped. Do not allow the collecting bank to stamp it on your behalf. (3) The name of the paying bank (i.e., the collecting bank) on the receipt slip for checks received should not be omitted. (4) The paying bank's clearing stamp should be stamped in the "Paying Bank Stamp" area. (5) If an error is discovered after clearing, both parties should reconcile with each other and issue a separate Qianku (Money Exchange) disbursement slip to rectify it. Do not arbitrarily erase anything on the receipt slip for checks received. (6) The "Total Paid Today" amount on the difference report form must match the total amount of the received notification slips and should not be increased or decreased arbitrarily."

### Satisfactory Sugar Supply - New Plan Proposed

A spokesman for the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office stated that, after careful study, the Business Office has drafted a concrete plan to ensure that all residents of the city can obtain an adequate supply of sugar, and will announce it within a few days. The spokesman declined to disclose the nature of the plan, but only said that this new plan is more effective than any plan previously implemented. Once approved by the authorities, it will be implemented immediately. Regarding reports of people purchasing sugar at the controlled price and reselling it for profit, the police authorities have taken note and are expected to take action to stop such activities. As for sugar shops selling sugar at black market prices of seven to nine yuan per pound, the Business Office has no power to stop it. Only the police can effectively stop such illegal activities by intervening.

In order to facilitate residents who return to their hometowns and return within a week, the authorities have decided on a method to be handled by each police station and ordered the Lianbao Jia chiefs to inform all citizens of the city to follow the regulations. The method is as follows: residents of this city who return to their hometowns and return to Shanghai within a week may first go to their respective police stations to complete the application procedures for movement, filling in the destination and the date of departure and return, and submitting their citizen's card to the police station for verification. The police station will keep the citizen's card and issue a movement application form in return. Citizens can use this return receipt to travel along the way, but they must carry it with them for inspection by the military and police. After returning to Shanghai, they must still report the return to the police station and exchange it for their citizen's card.

The 5,000 rickshaws of the Hongbei Shanghai Rickshaw Association (controlled by the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai) will soon be under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. The operating management regulations for these rickshaws will soon be published by the Police Department. The Shanghai Rickshaw Association was established five years ago with the permission of the Japanese military authorities to operate rickshaws in Hongkou, as the public bus and tram services in Hongkou had been suspended due to the Shanghai War. Now that transportation in Shanghai is gradually being unified, the Japanese Consulate General and the Public Concession Police Department, with the approval of the Japanese military authorities, have been engaged in consultations for the past five months. As a result, the Police Department will soon take over the rickshaws in Hongbei.

### Lodging Guests Must Present Citizen Certificates

Preventing Young Petty Thieves from Illegally Hiding

Because the authorities have recently discovered that most of the criminals apprehended do not possess citizen certificates, it is clear that these are generally petty criminals deliberately avoiding obtaining certificates in an attempt to engage in illegal activities. Therefore, it has been decided that personnel will be dispatched to conduct a door-to-door review of citizen certificates in conjunction with Lianbao Baojia personnel. Furthermore, hotel businesses have been instructed to notify their member hotels that in the future, when opening rooms for guests, they must first present their citizen certificate or county resident certificate. The guest registration book must also be filled out according to the address, occupation, or identity stated on the certificate. If accompanied by family members or relatives and friends, they must also be clearly identified one by one. Those without citizen certificates will be refused lodging in order to prevent petty criminals from hiding. Those who dare to deliberately violate this regulation will be severely punished. In addition, singers or prostitutes who are hired to enter hotels must carry their personal licenses issued by the Moral Affairs Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department for inspection; otherwise, they will not be allowed to stay.

### Unregistered Doctors Fined

### Seventh-first Session of the Rong Wu Society: Research on the I Ching

The seventy-first session of the Rong Wu Scripture Society featured a lecture by Mr. Yang Zhongyi on research into the I Ching. He stated, in brief, that the character "易" (I, change) consists of the sun (日) above and the moon (月) below. Xu Shen's Shuowen Jiezi quotes "The secret book considers the sun and moon as one 'I'," and the Commentary on the Appended Phrases says, "One yin and one yang is called the Dao," also, "The meaning of yin and yang is paired with the sun and moon," and "When the sun goes, the moon comes; when the moon goes, the sun comes; the sun and moon push each other, and brightness is born," and "Among the suspended images that illuminate things, nothing is greater than the sun and moon." The character "明" (ming, bright) contains the character "易," both derived from the sun and moon. One places them side by side horizontally, while the other stacks them vertically. The Dao of the I Ching is nothing more than the two elements of yin and yang. The most obvious manifestations of yin and yang are the sun and moon. Therefore, the sun and moon symbolize yin and yang. The so-called Taiyang (Sun) and Taiyin (Moon) are precisely this principle. The Qian (heaven) Dao becomes the male, and the Kun (earth) Dao becomes the female. Heaven is honored, and earth is lowly; Qian and Kun are established. Qian and Kun are the nature of yin and yang, and odd and even are the forms of yin and yang. Qian and Kun are the essence of the I Ching, and Qian and Kun are the gateway to the I Ching. If Qian and Kun are destroyed, there is no way to see the I Ching. If the I Ching cannot be seen, then Qian and Kun are almost lost. Therefore, the Dao of the I Ching is one yin and yang, yin and yang are one odd and even, odd and even are one Qian and Kun, and Qian and Kun are one heaven and earth. Heaven and earth operate, and all things are transformed and born. Is this not what is meant by "I"? After the lecture, it was announced that the next session would feature Mr. Shen Jueling lecturing on the ancient version of the Great Learning, and Mr. Zhao Ximing would speak on the topic of "Making Clear Virtue" (明道), expounding on the opening four sentences of the Great Learning.

### Watching Qilin Tong, Watching Painting, Running the City

— Su Shaoqing

Qilin Tong really has magic. He took the stage at the Queen's Theater on October 30th, performing Xue Jiajiang. Wealthy merchants, famous courtesans, the theater was packed. Half a year without seeing him, the longing is deep. I went with my friend, the owner of the Qilin Hall. When I arrived, he was singing the fan erhuang of changing children in the law field. It was slightly different from the ordinary singing method, but the acting and expression were superior. When he started calling the name "Ma Shi", he suddenly saw that the infant in Ma Shi's arms, who was about to be executed, was his own biological son. He couldn't cry openly, so he had to weep secretly. No one else can do this expression. When Xue Meng and Ma Shi knelt down to thank him, he helped up the tied-up Xue Meng and wanted to help Ma Shi up as well. But he suddenly remembered the principle that men and women should not touch hands, and he quickly retracted his hand, singing, "Madam Ma, you are a woman, you can get up yourself." The tone and emotion were all good. When singing about lifting the cauldron and watching the painting, he saw that the two stone lions in front of the government gate had suddenly merged into one. How could he not be shocked? He did this part well. His eyelids fluttered, and there was acting in his face. Unfortunately, the line "What is the reason for seeing the lions merged into one" was sung in a low gongchi, a minor flaw. When watching Xue Jiao raise the lions with both hands, he stood aside, his hands clenched tightly, helping Xue Jiao with his strength and squeezing a handful of sweat. This is the best part of Qilin Tong's acting style. Think about it, a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old student must raise two stone lions weighing more than a thousand catties with both hands. The purpose of adopting this child is to continue the incense of the Xue family and to count on him to avenge his family. Can he not worry about him? Ordinary actors often just stand stupidly on the side when they perform this part. Even if they do some acting, it is light and superficial, not as rich as Xin Fang. Speaking of this, I hope that actors and amateur actors will all learn Qilin Tong's acting style and emotion closely. You don't have to learn his singing style to death. When it came to the part of running the city, his masterpiece arrived. He had changed his makeup and clothes again. As soon as he came out, he had a different spirit. "The spirit is refreshing when the play meets a masterpiece." Sure enough, he was different from the crowd. When running, his whole body had many patterns, making people overwhelmed. Especially when he dug his legs and leaned his body, he walked diagonally from the corner of the stage (the upper left corner of the stage) to the upper entrance door. This hand was as fast as a swallow facing the wind and six hawks retreating. It was extremely beautiful. This is a kind of dance in art, for the sake of beauty, and cannot be reasoned with in the usual way. Fortunately, this play is a comedy. Today, Xu Ce has completed the great task of comforting the orphan, and he is extremely happy. Therefore, he uses a dance-style run to describe his joy. "The blue sky is not to be deceived." This section of "Gao Bozi" was sung well in every sentence. From the inverted board on the city tower, it was all audible. This time, not only was his voice not hoarse, but he also had a pleasant, skillful tone. This is certainly due to his cultivation and is also a sign of the old Qilin returning to his youth. It is gratifying and congratulatory. However, it is too tiring for one person to sing three plays in a row. When he sings again in the future, he may as well ask another old sheng to sing Watching the Painting, so that he can save some energy. The owner of the Qilin Hall, who was sitting next to me, clapped and admired his art while saying, "Xin Fang is too tired." I thought to myself that this is truly a Qilin cherishing a Qilin.

### After Watching Yun Caixia

— Wei Ren

"The era of Yun Caixia was in the early Republic of China. Most of the names mentioned inside are real people. What is not real is the characters and deeds of the script itself. Liu Xikui is a real person; Yun Caixia is not a real person. The relationship between the characters in the play and Liu Xikui can be said to be fabricated."

This is the self-confession of the playwright Li Jianwu, explaining the quality of the script itself. As for the progress of the story, it narrates the love history of Prince Shtolokai Xin'ai, Huang Taiji, and the female actor "Yun Caixia," with Mrs. Chen - who is always selfishly treating Huang Taiji as her patent - participating in it, and the corner-捧捧 Chen Shifan, the client Tu Ziguang, etc. "What stuff" fluctuated the ups and downs of the climax.

I think this is one of the more outstanding works that Li Jianwu has written so far, and the several positions and scenes arranged by director Zhu Duanjun are also stable and flawless.

It is very gratifying that the actors can all work hard on stage. Jiang Tianliu's Yun Caixia is the most successful in the whole play, with no part that does not hold your heartstrings. The "Baimenlou" section and the crazy appearance at the time of death are particularly wonderful. Huang Zongjiang's Tu Ziguang is like the typical kind of neither fish nor fowl of that era, and he has made more progress than "人间世". The qin player Wang Jingfu from a foreign land is also one that I like very much. Hu Dao's Chen Shifan is a bit too fiery. Yan Zhong's Ai Huang Taiji cannot completely grasp the personality. Huang Zongying did not develop due to the limitations of the script. Xia Xia's Mrs. Chen's jealous scene is very good.

Yang Xiaolou and Tan Xinpei's appearances are a kind of embellishment, and they have no drama at all. The backstage setting of the second act, although seemingly simple, is very realistic. The lighting is also not bad.

It is not easy to extract the essence of Peking opera and express it in the way of drama, but "Yun Caixia" gives me the impression of being very lively and lovely.

### Drama Spring and Autumn

— Guan Hua

"Zhong Zhong" after "Little Women", performed 君君逸's 紅星淚 (originally named 銀星夢), still led by Sun Jinglu.

Ma Xuweibang's "寒山夜雨" has been completed, and its results exceed "冷月詩魂". His new work was originally scheduled to be "秋海棠", but it is now said that he does not want to compete with Shanghai opera and Yue opera, and has decided to give it up.

Tan Xinpei and Yang Xiaolou in Yun Caixia are just running the show, passing the scene, commentators say "the good show is backstage".

### Talking about the magic group of Hui Chong

— Da Gu

Zhang Huichong's stage performance at Dahua this time, with its shocking and bizarre programs, has been greatly supported by the audience. Therefore, under the enthusiastic retention of the Dahua authorities, it was decided to continue the performance for several days, and several fresh programs were added and changed. Below are the main people in Zhang Huichong's magic group who are worth mentioning in this performance, which everyone may be happy to know.

Jin Ai Juan - is Zhang Huichong's wife, and she performs the main magic tricks such as the knife escape, tank escape, gas escape, trampling on women, etc. She is short, petite, and cute, and is a typical woman who performs magic. She has been following Zhang for more than ten years to perform magic.

Xu Lai Wu Jian - Xu Lai is Zhang Huichong's adopted daughter, and Wu Jian is the famous dancer "Curry Chicken", Wu Guanhua. This time, the two of them collaborated on two programs of dance, the beauty of the steps, and the roundness are different from the performances of general dance groups. Xu Lai started her singing and dancing life at the age of fifteen, joined Zhang's group to perform, and once entered the Hongye Dance Group to perform in Taiwan. In addition, she followed Zhang's group all over the country and Nanyang.

Jiang Kuanyu Jiang Suzhen - are father and daughter. Jiang Kuanyu is a strong man who has won the National Games Championship, and has won dozens of medals and certificates for performances in various places. His performance of bullfighting is especially praised by people. For several years, he has formed a group to perform in various places and has been welcomed. Not long ago, he also led a Guangming Technical Troupe to perform in various parts of North China. When he returned to Shanghai, it was when Zhang Huichong was preparing to take the stage, so he joined the performance after satisfactory talks. Jiang Suzhen has been influenced by her father over the years, and also has a very deep understanding of technology.

### Riding Through Storms Together

— He Jia Zhi

(11) Enemies

Among the people in the Shide Hall, only Huang Long expressed a unique opinion, saying, "Don't persuade Brother Wei Cheng. When a person is unhappy, they need to cry. The more they cry, the more relieved they feel. I'm often like that too." Second Madam Ye said, "Huang Long, help him to his room first. Magpie, hurry and wring a towel." Huang Long said, "Brother Wei Cheng, listen to Second Aunt, you don't have to cry. Let's wait a day, let me put the unhappiness you feel in my mind, and we'll cry together, crying until the world turns dark. Right now, you don't have to cry." Wei Cheng cried for a while, and then suddenly stopped. He didn't need Huang Long to help him to his room, nor did he want the towel Magpie wrung. He rubbed his eyelids with his fingers and still knelt, wanting to continue reading the eulogy. But he couldn't. Second Madam Ye took the tear-stained eulogy from Wei Cheng's hand. Huang Long again reached under Wei Cheng's armpits with both hands and pulled him up. Many female relatives wanted to offer words of comfort. Huang Long said, "I let you cry just now, but now I can't let you be a filial son. Eldest Aunt, your son wants to be a filial son, but I won't let him." He nodded to Eldest Madam Ye, supporting and pulling Wei Cheng, pulling him to the room.

The first to follow Huang Long into the room was Cui Zhen. Cui Zhen smiled, with reddened eyelids, "Brother Cheng, lie down for a while." Many female relatives in the hall sighed and lamented. Second Madam Ye burned the eulogy, forcing a smile, "If I knew he would be so sad and cry so much, I wouldn't have had a memorial service for Eldest Sister-in-law. This child is a person of utmost sincerity and emotion. Huang Long's words are also right, it's good to let him cry it out. This matter is also a coincidence. I heard that last night, the glass on his father's framed portrait broke, which was an ominous sign." Great Aunt said, "The Ye family, this is the only child left. His father and mother both passed away before seeing him marry a wife, so it's no wonder he wants to cry. When we sisters talk about Wei Cheng, we feel that even a heart of stone would be saddened and shed tears." Second Aunt said, "Isn't that so?" As they were talking in the hall, a sharp cry suddenly came from Wei Cheng's room, startling Madam Ye and the others. (226)
