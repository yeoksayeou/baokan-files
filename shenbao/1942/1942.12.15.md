### Winter Relief

Shanghai remains a prosperous metropolis, not only the first major city in China but also, in terms of market affluence and luxurious living, likely "second to none" in all of East Asia. However, upon closer inspection, we discover that the prosperity and wealth Shanghai retains today, five or six years into the war, is a distorted prosperity, a prosperity that violates the goals of the Greater East Asia War, a prosperity that sees a few people taking advantage of wartime conditions to profit and get rich. Behind this facade of prosperity lies a shocking decline. Poverty is rampant, with the entire middle and lower classes struggling for survival. We must recognize that, of Shanghai's four million-plus population, the middle and lower classes forced into "hidden poverty" and "absolute poverty" today constitute the absolute majority; and these citizens are precisely the fundamental force cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. To allow these citizens to decline and become impoverished, leaving only a few nouveau riche and magnates, while still chanting about cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, is simply unimaginable. Therefore, saving the fate of Shanghai's vast middle and lower classes, rescuing the "hidden poor" and "absolute poor" masses, is an important task for the current authorities and leaders of all sectors of society, and winter relief is a major part of this task.

Winter relief is not a novel movement; it has almost been regarded as an "annual routine." In the past, those who carried out this work would only perform a superficial winter relief effort when winter arrived. Even those who sincerely devoted themselves to the effort ultimately faced limitations due to limited manpower and resources and focused only on passive relief, naturally limiting the results. Now, in the extraordinary period of the Greater East Asia War, this year's winter relief has a different meaning from past winter relief efforts. This year's winter relief must have a positive significance, that is to say, it must aim to save the fate of the hidden poor and absolutely poor classes teetering on the brink, to gather the strength of Shanghai's general middle and lower classes, and to further become a great force assisting the authorities in promoting everything beneficial to a new Shanghai and helpful to the Greater East Asia War.

In this year's winter relief with its novel significance, we must have methods that adapt to this significance: First, we sincerely hope that the authorities recognize the special needs and significance of this year's winter relief, address the actual situation of Shanghai society, especially gain insight into the actual situation of the vast number of hidden poor and absolutely poor classes, listen to the opinions of leaders from all sectors and experts, and quickly formulate the basic guidelines and implementation outline for this year's winter relief, in order to promote a planned, organized, and step-by-step winter relief movement. The authorities should also stand in a supporting position during the implementation of winter relief and should not relax their supervisory responsibilities at any time, so that this year's winter relief can achieve fruitful results through unified implementation.

Second, the implementers of winter relief work are naturally not the authorities but the existing charitable organizations and leaders from all sectors of society. However, in view of the lack of close contact and mutually coordinated plans among various groups in past winter relief work, which inevitably led to phenomena of favoring the easy over the difficult and attending to one thing while neglecting another, it was difficult to expect satisfactory results. This year's winter relief must be earnestly implemented under the authorities' established winter relief movement guidelines and leadership, according to established steps. At the same time, all charitable organizations, in particular, should have a broad vision, not harbor concepts of boundaries or sectarianism, contact each other, take care of each other, and fully achieve the point of "division of labor and cooperation," so that no energy or financial resources are wasted and all can achieve considerable results. At the same time, those receiving relief, the hidden poor and the absolutely poor, will universally receive practical benefits, without a few people receiving relief from many sources while the majority have the regret of "missing out."

Third, there must be a full understanding of the targets of relief. We believe that this year's winter relief, in addition to the absolutely poor, must pay particular attention to the "hidden poor." The so-called absolutely poor are vagrants or beggars with no clothes, no food, and no home to return to. For these people, in addition to the usual distribution of clothing and porridge, it is best that various relevant charitable organizations and the authorities cooperate to establish special agencies to handle the absolutely poor. Those who have a hometown to return to should be helped to leave Shanghai and return home; the old, weak, and disabled should be assigned to various suitable charitable organizations, given necessary medical care, food, and clothing, and provided with vocational training, so that they do not remain dependent and have the opportunity to work. For general young men and women with no home and no hometown to return to, they cannot be rescued by ordinary means and need to be forced into vocational training centers or training centers, given necessary skills, and subjected to strict training, so that they become productive members of society in the shortest possible time.

Secondly, the so-called "hidden poor" class refers to those with existing jobs who earn low salaries (including teachers, etc.). This type of person constitutes the vast majority of Shanghai citizens today, and the true prosperity of Shanghai and the genuine cooperation between China and Japan depend on the awareness and voluntary efforts of these people. However, most of these people have very little income and have the burden of a family, leading to a difficult struggle for survival. From the perspective of negative relief, even if all of Shanghai's charitable organizations exerted their full strength, they might not be able to save even a fraction of them; however, from the perspective of active relief, assisting this hidden poor class is of greater and more urgent significance than assisting the absolutely poor. Therefore, this year's winter relief must include the hidden poor as one of its targets, devise appropriate methods, and work closely with the authorities, various charitable organizations, and heads of various industries and institutions to implement them. Only then can it be said to be "immeasurable merit," and it will also make an immeasurable contribution to Shanghai's social, economic, and political future.

Fourth, regarding the funds for winter relief, (1) the source is mainly mobilizing leaders from all sectors to conduct fundraising under unified guidelines and methods, especially with the principle of voluntary donations from citizens as the main principle. Secondly, we also hope that the Municipal Council will allocate a sum of money from entertainment taxes for this year's winter relief. (2) The method of use must be in accordance with unified guidelines and methods, taking into account the actual situation, distinguishing between urgency and importance, and proceeding cautiously, in order to avoid wasting a single penny. Moreover, all accounts must be published publicly at any time.

Finally, we reiterate that Shanghai's current prosperity and wealth are only a superficial phenomenon, and the vast middle and lower-class citizens are on the verge of extreme hardship. This is a great hidden concern for the city's economy, society, and politics. We loudly call out here, hoping that those in leadership positions will recognize this crisis, quickly cooperate with the authorities, and actively launch relief work, starting with winter relief work. We hope that the authorities and leaders from all sectors will show some results in this year's winter relief to comfort the public's hopes.

### ### Emperor of Japan Visits Ise Grand Shrine to Pray for Victory in War; Prime Minister Tojo Urges the People to Rise Up and Concentrate Efforts to Complete the Greater East Asia War

Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) – Yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of the Imperial Household announced that the Emperor departed on the morning of December 11th at 8:00 AM to visit Kyoto Prefecture and Mie Prefecture to worship at the Ise Grand Shrine, and returned to the palace yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. The 100 million Japanese people, upon hearing that the Emperor personally visited the Ise Grand Shrine to pray for victory in the war, were greatly moved and encouraged. This is a historic first. Those accompanying him included Chief Aide-de-Camp Hyakutake, Grand Chamberlain Matsudaira, Lord Chamberlain Ohto, and Prime Minister Tojo.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A statement from the Ministry of the Imperial Household stated that His Majesty the Emperor departed on the 11th of this month to visit Kyoto Prefecture and Mie Prefecture. On the 12th, he reverently and personally conducted a solemn worship ceremony at the Ise Grand Shrine. He stayed overnight at the Kyoto Imperial Palace on the evening of the same day and returned to the palace on the 13th. Historically, the Japanese Emperor used to send imperial envoys to the Ise Grand Shrine to silently pray to the imperial ancestors during times of emergency, starting with the Mongolian invasion of Japan, followed by numerous occasions during the late shogunate period. However, His Majesty the Emperor personally visiting the Grand Shrine under the circumstances of war to pray for victory is an unprecedented event in the history of the Grand Shrine, deeply moving the 100 million people of Japan. This visit by His Majesty the Emperor has further strengthened the determination of the entire Japanese nation to persevere in the war to the end, and at the same time demonstrated to the universe Japan's national determination to strive for ultimate victory.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo made a statement on the 13th regarding the Emperor's personal visit to the Ise Grand Shrine to pray for victory in the war, stating in essence that it has been a long-standing custom for the Emperor to send imperial envoys to the Grand Shrine to report and seek divine assistance when major events occur in the nation. However, it is unprecedented in history for His Majesty the Emperor to visit the Grand Shrine during the midst of war and personally worship before the imperial ancestor deity. This visit by the Emperor is to report the unprecedented great war achievements of our country in the land, sea, and air in the year since the start of the war. During this critical autumn of the war situation, His Majesty personally leads the people to seek the protection of the ancestral spirits, which is truly a profound consideration. I was honored to be ordered to accompany the visit and witness the glorious ceremony of worshipping at the Grand Shrine. In my fear and gratitude, I resolve to dedicate myself completely and exhaust my loyalty to ease the imperial mind. Today, the Greater East Asia War has entered its second year. The Emperor's personal visit to the Grand Shrine makes us 100 million citizens even more aware of the gravity of the current situation. We must rise up with inspiration and courage. All 100 million citizens must be of one heart and one mind, concentrate the total power of the nation, and complete the Greater East Asia War to repay the imperial grace even in the slightest.

### Talking about Tomorrow's Decisive Battle from the South Pacific Naval Battle – Participants: Colonel Hiraide, Chief of the Naval Press Department of the Imperial Headquarters

— Abe Kenichi, Chief Editor of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun

(2)

Translated from the December 13th issue of "Weekly Mainichi"

Hiraide: Indeed, I feel the same way. While it's unclear what the American senior commanders have been learning up to now, I can say that they have many shortcomings. Especially in this war, after air raid alarms are issued, these alarms fail to reach the commanders in a timely manner. For example, in Hawaii, according to the results of the enemy's inquiry and interrogation, our large formation was seen heading towards Pearl Harbor 30 minutes before the attack on December 8th. However, the information did not reach the commander in time. Also, the activities of our submarines in Pearl Harbor were spotted by enemy cruisers and came under fire, which was about an hour before the air raid. However, this was not reported to the commander. On August 8th of this year, on the very day of the Battle of Savo Island, enemy aircraft twice discovered and reconnoitered our forces preparing for a night attack at 9:30 PM and 10:00 PM. However, no appropriate action was taken afterward. If they had been slightly more alert at the time, our night attack force would have undoubtedly been subjected to an enemy air raid that afternoon.

Abe: Since January of last year, Commander Hall had been urging the navy to prepare defenses against Japan, but this order was ineffective. I believe this is due to the American "ma-hu" (carelessness). Their peacetime training is terrible. Training cannot be successful with commands alone. It requires a long period of ten or twenty years of honing. Although the details of the Solomon Islands naval battle are unclear, I recently read Mr. Niwa Fumio's account of the naval battle, which said that when our planes flew over, the enemy patrol planes just stared blankly, without firing a single shot. Only after we attacked did they panic and return fire. This is truly unimaginable.

Hiraide: I think there is a reason for this. The enemy had almost never considered night battles, and therefore had never had any training in them. Everything stops at night, so why fight? That's probably what the American old boys thought. Many British and American naval attachés had stayed in Japan for a long time. They may have studied how our navy was trained and what tactics it learned. That was their job. So they should have known that the Japanese navy had night battle training. However, the result was that they had no countermeasures, which is truly tragic. They probably thought: No matter how much training Japan has, a small country is unlikely to have any real achievements. They had always been so arrogant and dismissive. What's worse, they don't wake up after losing the battle. They still deceive themselves into thinking: This defeat was entirely due to negligence and insufficient recognition. They should train more and see us again in 1944...

The Essence of Air Defense - Ideological Warfare

Abe: They have wonderful dreams.

Hiraide: It's a world-unique idea. They're thinking about it even in their dreams. The fleet is the best in the world... everything is the best in the world.

Abe: But if they're aiming for 1943 and 1944, they'll have to find a way to retaliate during that time, right? The air raid on April 18th was the first sign, and there will probably be more of those kinds of things. We must build an iron wall of air defense, both psychologically and in terms of equipment, to defend ourselves. What's your opinion?

Hiraide: I think that the most important thing about air defense is to create an atmosphere of ideological warfare. Especially when families are destroyed and food storage places are bombed, the significance of this ideological warfare is very clear. At that time, the people may become tired of the war, hoping for an early end to the war and a restoration of peace, and so on. And our task is to boost morale, to tell them that even if they are grieved, they must restrain their grief and serve the country forever.

Abe: That's indeed the case. Especially in the war against the United States, people tend to think: How can we compete with the United States, a country with such powerful production capacity? But we must know that there is such a thing as ten times, twenty times the combat power. The significance of ideological warfare is that, as Prime Minister Tojo said, the people must have the belief in victory, to defeat the many with the few, to overcome the rich with the poor. Numbers are not to be trusted. What we trust forever is the power within our Yamato nation.

### Pétain Replied to Hitler, Stating the Wishes of the French Government, Hoping to Restore Mutual Trust and Establish Honorable Understanding

Vichy, 13th (Havas News Agency) – German leader Hitler sent a telegram to Marshal Pétain on November 27th of this year, stating that German troops would occupy the French naval base in Toulon and requesting the demobilization of the French army. Marshal Pétain sent a reply on the 5th of this month explaining the situation. The original telegram was recently announced to reporters by Chief Laval as follows: "Your Excellency, France has suffered misfortune, but maintains a deep connection with its land, sea, and air forces. This is a manifestation of France's loyalty to the spirit of military tradition over the centuries. Your Excellency allowed France to retain a portion of its army in the armistice agreement, proving that Your Excellency is deeply aware of the value of this sentiment and the generosity of the German people. This time, the British and American Allied forces invaded North Africa, and a portion of French leaders rebelled, causing Your Excellency to take various measures, such as occupying our borders and the Mediterranean coast, and demobilizing our army, to ensure safety. I can only obey these decisions that shocked the country. Your Excellency believes that any country without an army rich in discipline and obedience to superiors has no value in existence. Wise words! It is with this in mind that I have made it my mission to rebuild an army sufficient to protect France and its colonies. Two years ago, I refused to leave the territory of mainland France and requested an armistice, solely to spare France from greater disasters. I believe that it is not impossible for an honorable understanding to be established between our two countries. This policy can simultaneously resolve the interests of France and the interests of other European nations. However, this can only be effective under the power of a government that enjoys freedom of action. Your Excellency personally guaranteed this freedom in the message to the French people on November 10th of this year. I resolutely expanded the power of the Head of Government, Laval, to express my hope for restoring mutual trust between our two countries and establishing a policy of understanding. I deeply believe that Your Excellency's spirit of compromise will be conducive to the implementation of this policy. Sincerity is conveyed. I am most expectant, Pétain."

Laval Announced Diplomatic Policy to the Press

Vichy, 14th (Domei News Agency) – The Head of the French Government, Laval, announced the diplomatic policy to the press yesterday, stating that France must determine its policy towards Germany. France has erred again and again and is now paying a great price. It is regrettable that even at this point, some people are leaning towards the Allied side. In fact, Germany's victory would be beneficial to France. Only by maintaining a close relationship between France and Germany can Europe be protected from communism. The government authorities have now arrested over a thousand people, including former Prime Minister Herriot.

Madrid, 13th (Central News Agency) – Observers in informed circles here believe that Head of Government Laval will meet with German leader Hitler around the 13th to exchange views on the reorganization of the French cabinet, the return of the French government to Paris, and other important issues. The general public attaches great importance to the talks between the two.

### Heavy Rain in Tunisia Affects Military Operations; Intense Air Battles in Cyrenaica; German Planes Bomb the Port of Benghazi

Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Although this place refuses to comment on the military news from the Cyrenaica front, informed sources are quite optimistic about the development of the battle situation. They stated that the development of the North African war situation the other day should enable the German position to become more stable. Once the details can be announced, it will prove that General Rommel can still manipulate the war, overcome the enemy and win. In Tunisia, there are only small local battles, and continuous heavy rain has greatly affected military operations.

Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Reliable sources here claim that the temporary port facilities recently built by the British in Benghazi were bombed by German planes yesterday, causing a lot of damage. There was an air battle in the Mediterranean yesterday. The Allied side lost 12 aircraft, and one German aircraft did not return to its base.

Rome, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian military report this afternoon stated that in the fierce air battle in Cyrenaica yesterday, German aircraft shot down a total of nine enemy aircraft. The German side suffered no losses. Another three enemy aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft teams. The land warfare in Cyrenaica yesterday was only skirmishes and artillery battles. In Tunisia, Axis aircraft were dispatched day and night to bomb the enemy's supply hubs, especially the port of Bone. Enemy aircraft attacked the city of Susa in Tunisia, causing heavy civilian casualties.

Lisbon, 14th (Domei News Agency) – US Secretary of the Army Stimson announced the North African operational goal yesterday, stating that the Allied forces must first destroy all Axis aircraft, and then attack Tripoli to wipe out General Rommel's troops, so that the Mediterranean Sea becomes a safe line of communication directly to the Near East. Observers here commented that Stimson's approach has not achieved anything and admits that Rommel's troops are the most elite and unparalleled in the world.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun dispatch from Lisbon, as a result of the meeting between British Prime Minister Churchill and South African Federal Prime Minister Smuts in London, a portion of the South African Federal troops will soon enter the Tunisian front. This preparatory action has caused discontent among the people of South Africa. Therefore, knowledgeable people say that the South African Federation should reject Britain's use of South African troops abroad.

### Eastern Front Situation

Haitong telegram from the German Supreme Headquarters, 14th: Today's German war bulletin states: In the Caucasus Mountains, enemy attacks yesterday were repelled. Fierce battles occurred in other sections of the southern front and are still ongoing.

In the Kolmak grassland, our troops penetrated the enemy's rear, capturing many prisoners. The enemy's supply line there is threatened by our forces. Soviet attacks on the Don River front were severely repulsed by Italian forces. 25 Soviet aircraft were lost, while German aircraft lost only 4. Between Kalinin and Lake Ilmen, fighting continues. Soviet attempts to break through failed, resulting in the loss of 31 tanks. From November 25th to date, the Soviets have had a total of 1,568 tanks destroyed by German forces in that area.

### Japan-Vietnam Sign Economic Agreement

(4) The Chongqing air force launched several attacks in the latter part of the month, but after fierce attacks by Japanese aircraft and ground artillery, the Chongqing aircraft dropped bombs in panic, blindly bombing civilian houses, causing popular resentment to reach its peak. (5) From September to the end of November, the combined results of the Japanese military in the Wuhan area were as follows: 5,200 bodies of Chongqing soldiers were abandoned, and 1,800 were captured. Japanese forces intercepted 5 artillery pieces and 190 heavy and light machine guns.

### Recent Scenes in India

—News from New Delhi via the Interior—

The Indian people's riots, up to today (August 24th), continue to rise one after another. The center of the turmoil has shifted from the cities to the countryside. Trains are often interrupted, and letters are delayed because the railway is sometimes demolished for a section, or perhaps small stations are destroyed.

October 2nd is Gandhi's seventy-fourth birthday. In the week before this day, India will hold "Weaving Week" to promote self-woven homespun cloth as a commemoration.

New Delhi is experiencing a housing shortage, because more agencies are coming, and the government is requisitioning. Europeans living in the suburbs are moving to the city, so there is a sudden shortage of houses.

New Delhi has several new agencies and organizations of the Chongqing regime. The "Central News Agency Indian Branch" and the "Transportation Office" have been formally established. The "Bank of China" has also moved from the suburbs to the city. The offices of the "National Diplomacy Association" and the "Shi Yu Chao Society" are being prepared.

The three Chinese restaurants in New Delhi are doing very well, because British and American soldiers like to eat Chinese food. There are many Chinese in Calcutta. Although there are many genuine merchants, there are also quite a few who use the name to do business. Once, the port customs of Calcutta discovered that a certain important person from the Chongqing side was carrying a large amount of gold, so all Chinese travelers were strictly inspected and given particularly bad treatment.

New Delhi was originally a quiet ancient city, but now it has become a military stronghold. As the reporter writes, the sound of aircraft rumbles in the sky. Heavenly soldiers are descending, apparently training parachute troops.

There are not many bookstores in New Delhi, and there are even fewer important political publications.

### Experiences of Overseas Chinese Students in the Interior: Overcorrection Leading to Refusal of Re-enrollment; Thousands of Miles of Trekking Leaving Them Confused

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Chongqing government, in order to implement its "Resistance War" policy, spared no effort in propaganda, attempting to enhance its final struggle, especially economically. On the one hand, it implemented the so-called "economic warfare," and on the other hand, it repeatedly solicited donations and absorbed foreign exchange in overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Over three or four years, the overseas Chinese masses, deceived by propaganda, contributed truly considerable sums.

Last year, with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Southeast Asian region was successively occupied by the Japanese army. The Chongqing government's propaganda power was immediately eliminated. However, some overseas Chinese youths were deeply influenced by past temptations, mistakenly believing the various arrangements for overseas Chinese students that had been announced by the Chongqing Ministry of Education over the years, and braved thousands of miles of wind and frost, trekking long distances back to the interior, hoping to re-enroll. However, the result was that many were rejected outside the school gates for "insufficient documentation." Recently, two students wrote from the interior, although the regions were different, the facts of their experiences were the same.

One, a student from Duyun, Guizhou, wrote, in essence, saying… When abroad, whether it was through hearsay or newspaper reports, domestic educational institutions had established arrangements for overseas Chinese students to prevent them from dropping out of school, and overseas Chinese affairs agencies had established arrangements to take care of overseas Chinese students during travel. Overseas Chinese students were all pleased and excited, so they endured hardship and rushed back to their homeland. How could they have known that after arriving at their destination, they would be rejected thousands of miles away for "insufficient documentation," left confused and at a crossroads, unable to advance or retreat. At this time, it was too late to regret the error of being deceived by propaganda in the past. An old classmate from Nanhai Kang, Guangdong, also wrote that he was forced to return home under the same circumstances. Most of us young people left our families and embarked on our journey hastily, without having time to carry supporting documents, and some even risked breaking through the encirclement. Even if we had documents, we would not have time to carry them. Therefore, there should be special consideration for our re-enrollment issue, and we should not be bound by regulations or documents, thus losing the opportunity for further study.

Second, a student from Babu, Guangxi, wrote, also saying… After the fall of Hong Kong, the principal avoided meeting and there was no news after months of visits, so he ventured back to the country without waiting for documents. He was questioned and searched by the Japanese army along the way, with no details spared. If he had carried documents with him, they would have been discovered and it would have been impossible to pass through. He was filled with joy and tears welled up in his eyes. Upon arriving in Wuzhou, he went to the local Overseas Chinese Relief Association. The attitude of the staff there was truly heartbreaking. Their demeanor was as if they were the saviors of the overseas Chinese, putting on an "almighty" official air, making people feel uncomfortable. When registering for the first time, they immediately demanded documents. Although he earnestly explained the reasons, they turned a deaf ear and did not understand the difficulties of the overseas Chinese students at all. The so-called "the lower situation cannot reach the higher level, and the upper virtue cannot permeate the lower level" is a common disease. Moreover, is the "virtue" of the upper level merely empty promises? The staff of the overseas Chinese relief organization should be like the nurses in a hospital, giving patients the greatest comfort and alleviating their suffering. They must not treat overseas Chinese students who have returned from thousands of miles away as suspected criminals, deeply wounding our hearts.

### Violation of Air Defense Control Law to be Punished as Reactionary Crimes; Full-Scale Air Defense Drill Began Yesterday

The second air defense drill in the city began yesterday and will last approximately ten days. In addition to controlling lights, other important training items have been added to this drill.

Reason for Early Issuance of Precautionary Alarm

The air defense precautionary alarm was issued at 1:00 PM yesterday. The purpose of this drill is to ensure that residents cover their windows before dusk, in other words, before lighting time. However, some residents did not pay attention to the alarm at all, often failing to close window curtains or skylights, or install blackout shades before turning on the lights. We urge the public to pay attention. The precautionary alarm may last for a long time, but if there is an air raid alarm, the precautionary alert will be temporarily suspended. In any case, the blackout must be maintained until the all-clear signal is issued. In accordance with regulations, pedestrians are only allowed to proceed on the left side of the cordon ten minutes after the air raid alarm is issued.

Tense Situation During Last Night's Drill

The air defense control last night was more tense than the previous time. All Baojia personnel, self-defense corps, police air defense committee members, rescue teams, transportation teams, health teams, and fire brigades in the two concession areas of Shanghai South, Shanghai West, Zhabei, and Hongkou were mobilized, either patrolling the streets or inspecting households. All residents and shops obeyed the alarm. The precautionary alarm was issued at 1:00 PM, and those with duties in the self-defense corps were mobilized in both concessions. Rope barriers were even used to create pedestrian walkways along Avenue Edward VII. The air raid alarm was issued at 8:05 PM. Streetlights were all turned off, and aircraft ascended and circled for surveillance. The all-clear siren was issued at 9:30 PM, but the air defense alert remained in effect.

Police Commissioner's Remarks

The second full-scale air defense drill began yesterday. Police Commissioner Watanabe Tadashi of the Municipal Council issued a statement urging the people of the city to cooperate in order to enhance the efficiency of air defense. Anyone who deliberately disobeys the authorities' intentions and does not maintain proper cooperation with the local army and navy authorities will be regarded as a reactionary and punished according to law. What citizens should pay particular attention to is the recently changed alarm method. It is hoped that everyone will listen for the alarm at any time and follow the instructions. This air defense drill is much more extensive than the previous one and will include light control, sound traffic control, gas defense and rescue, and alarm transmission methods. It is also hoped that Baojia personnel and self-defense corps will be vigilant at all times during this drill and maintain security and order within their areas.

Form Air Defense Groups

Each Bao in the various districts of the Public Concession must form an air defense group, with each Bao as a unit. This air defense group is still a special and novel organization, with the Baozheng (Bao head) serving as the group leader and the Fu Baozheng (deputy Bao head) serving as the deputy group leader. Each air defense group is divided into five teams, under the command of the group leader and deputy group leader. Each team is equipped with flags and armbands for identification. The names and tasks of the five teams under the air defense group are as follows: (1) Air Surveillance Team: There must be five people on duty at all times, setting up lookout posts in high places in each Bao to specifically pay attention to whether there are aircraft sounds and whether there is any light leakage within the Bao. (2) Alarm Transmission Team. (3) Rescue Team: The task of this team is to immediately mobilize if there is an air raid and civilians are killed or injured. All children under the age of seven, elderly people over the age of seventy, and maternity patients should be escorted to a safe location. (4) Air Defense and Anti-Gas Team. (5) Traffic Control and Guard Team. At 2:00 PM this afternoon, the above-mentioned technical training will be held at the racecourse.

Muffle Car Horns

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Bureau recently issued Gazette No. 6203, stipulating that during the implementation of air defense alerts, the owners of all motorcycles should reduce the sound of electric horns when pressing them so that they resemble the sound of a toy horn. The standard style of this type of horn that can be used during air defense alerts is now on display at Yangzi Motors, located on the ground floor of the Broadway Building at 10 North Suzhou Road, for public viewing. If there are any violators of the above regulations, the police will suspend their vehicle licenses. Hereby announce as above.

### Hawking House Rent Receipt Books to be Investigated by Authorities

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Bureau, in view of the fact that there are unscrupulous people impersonating Bureau officials and hawking house rent receipt books to sub-landlords for the purpose of collecting rent from sub-tenants, hereby issues Gazette No. 6200, notifying sub-landlords within the Concession that if they encounter such situations, they should immediately report to the nearest police station or report to the Re-leasing License Regulations Office at Room 374 of this Bureau for investigation. Furthermore, Bureau officials carry identification documents when serving outside, and those involved may request to see them for verification.

### Special Rationing Handled by Sugar Industry Cooperative

After the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office adopted a rationing system to maintain sugar supplies, this month's sugar ration of 30,000 bags has been approved for a moving permit by the cooperative, and the goods have been transported from Pudong to the office warehouse for storage. Rationing procedures are being expedited for Class A retailers and Class B users. Sugar purchase certificates have been issued, and after they are issued, a notice will be issued to pay and pick up goods at the designated sugar shop. It is heard that the cooperatives (1) allow applications to be filed in accordance with the law for each industry's legitimate need for sugar in business, provided that the use is explained, and will be rationed after approval; (2) allow apartment tenants without house tax tickets to apply for special rations from the office with proof from the apartment. In order to strictly supervise the Class A retailers, supervisors and inspectors will be dispatched to supervise and inspect sales ledgers to prevent abuses with each issuing sugar based on house tax tickets and citizen ID. As for Class B users, the use of the sugar rationed each month should be reported in detail, and it is strictly forbidden to take advantage of the situation and distribute it privately.

### Forum on the Food Crisis

In view of the severity of the Shanghai food crisis, our newspaper has twice published articles on the matter, and we hope that all sectors of society will express their opinions, so as to arrive at concrete and reasonable conclusions, and contribute to the authorities' adoption of these. Recently, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, took the lead in submitting a written opinion, all of which suggestions are timely and appropriate, and address practical counter-measures. Therefore, we have specially opened this forum for publication, and still hope that all sectors will put forward concrete suggestions, and learn from each other. We would be very grateful.

Opinions on Rice Rationing

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four major elements of people's lives, especially food, which is indispensable for even a single day. As the saying goes, "Food is the most important thing for the people." Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the number of ships has decreased over the years, transportation has become difficult, and rice prices have gradually risen. Due to the lack of sources of foreign rice, the authorities have implemented control over food such as rice and flour, and rationed it based on population. From July 6 to December 10, nineteen rations have been distributed. From the first to the eleventh rations, each ration was for one week. From the twelfth to the nineteenth rations, each ration was for ten days. The quantity of each ration was, on average, one and a half "sheng" of rice (white rice or broken rice) and one and a half "jin" of flour. Initially, the citizens already felt that the quantity for each week was insufficient, roughly enough for four days' meals for an average appetite, and there was no solution for the remaining three days. When it was changed to a ten-day ration, the insufficiency was even worse, so they had no choice but to rely on the black market for a full meal. However, apart from a very small number of citizens above the middle class who had some savings, the majority of ordinary citizens felt greatly troubled. In the past, when rations were distributed once a week, the demand for black market rice was not very high, so the official ration price was 25 yuan per "dou" of national currency, and the black market price was only about 40 yuan. By the time of the autumn harvest in various places, when new grains were available, it was logical that rice prices should gradually fall, but in reality, the opposite was true. Recently, the price has even increased to about 100 yuan per "dou," which is truly an unprecedentedly high price in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. The reason for this is that the rice stored in each household has been exhausted, the rationing period has been extended to ten days, and broken rice is more abundant than white rice in each ration. Although an additional half "jin" of flour can be purchased, the quantity is limited and not enough to make up for the shortage. As a result, the demand for food has suddenly become high, and the price of rice on the black market has continued to rise. Efforts should be made to improve the situation in order to ensure the stability of people's lives. Therefore, concrete opinions on rationing are described in detail below.

A. Advantages and Disadvantages of Movement Restrictions

The control of materials is indeed a necessary phenomenon in wartime, and food, in particular, should be subject to control. However, the control methods are indeed worth discussing. For example, the quantity of each ration must be suitable for the average person's food consumption, so that the rations of each household do not need to rely on the black market again. The black market will naturally disappear, and the profiteers will have no way to hoard. The general public's panic about food and the burden of high rice prices can be alleviated. Currently, because the quantity of rations based on population is insufficient and the quality of rice is too poor, citizens have no choice but to seek help from peddlers. The authorities' restrictions on the movement of rice and grain have clearly stipulated that no one may exceed two "dou." However, the common villagers who are peddlers want to enter the concessions from the cordon. [Redacted text due to degradation] Great difficulty. [Redacted text due to degradation] See each grain of rice as something acquired at the risk of one’s life, something more precious than pearls. The more difficulties encountered along the way, the more the rice price in the central area of the concession rises; this is inevitable.

It has been found that Jiang, Zhejiang, and Anhui have fortunately had good harvests this year. According to general knowledge, when new grains are available, rice prices should normally fall. Therefore, in various counties along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line, the price of new rice is generally between 220 yuan and 250 yuan per "shi." If the authorities did not strictly restrict the entry of rice, how could the price of rice in the concession be as high as about 100 yuan per "dou," which is a difference of 700 to 800 yuan per "shi" compared to the rice prices in neighboring counties? This kind of malignant deformity is truly an unprecedented oddity. The restriction on the movement of rice and grain by the concession authorities is to prevent a small number of people from hoarding and speculating. The cordon's restriction on the entry of rice and grain has resulted in the above-mentioned phenomenon. Not only do the majority of citizens suffer greatly in their lives, it also directly stimulates the surge in other general prices and labor costs, indirectly hindering the implementation of price control policies, and at the same time, it also affects the rice prices and commodity prices outside of Shanghai. Guan Zhong of the Spring and Autumn period and Chao Cuo of the Han Dynasty said: "When clothing and food are insufficient, the people have little sense of shame." "When the granaries are full, then they know etiquette; when clothing and food are sufficient, then they know honor and disgrace." If we continue in this way without changing the current customs, an economic crisis will inevitably develop into a political crisis, because "the people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is solid, the state is secure." We sincerely hope that the authorities, under the premise of "making the people have enough food," will quickly seek a symptomatic solution. Not only should any passive restrictions on movement and prohibitions on the inflow of rice be lifted, but we also hope that businesses will be actively encouraged to purchase and transport rice in large quantities to relieve the suffering of the citizens.

Furthermore, the abolition of any movement restrictions and prohibitions on the inflow of rice seems to be one-sidedly passive. What is more actively needed is that all restrictions on the export and movement of any rice in general peaceful areas should also be lifted, restoring its freedom of operation, while restricting its manipulation and hoarding, and at the same time vigorously correcting any form of oppression and extortion. For example, if the price of rice in Suzhou is 250 yuan per "shi," and it is transported to Shanghai, after paying regular taxes and all legitimate transportation costs, for example, 280 yuan, then the selling price in Shanghai should be at most 300 yuan per "shi," which is already a generous profit. However, the actual selling price is as high as 900 yuan. [Redacted text due to degradation] Thus, consumers bear extra damage, which is something that everyone abhors and deeply regrets.

B. Opinions on the Rice Ticket System

Since the two concession authorities implemented rice and grain rationing in July of this year, the practice of milling rice has begun to subside. If the quantity of rations is increased, then all problems can be solved. Now that the quantity of rations is insufficient, there is no point in talking about the rice ticket system. However, if it is replaced with a rice ticket system, a suitable amount of rice tickets should be issued daily based on population. If meals are eaten at home, then the rice tickets can be used by the household to purchase rice from rice shops. If meals are eaten in groups or banquets, then each diner can provide a rice ticket, so that the caterer can use the tickets to purchase rice from rice shops. In this way, there will be no duplication, and statistics can be more accurate. The difficulty is that Shanghai is a mixed settlement, with a dense network of transportation lines. Every day, there are tens of thousands of merchants and travelers coming and going. For example, when taking the Beijing-Shanghai train to Shanghai, about three thousand passengers arrive at each station. Have all the ports implemented population-based rationing? Do the people carry rice tickets with them? Even if they do, can the rice tickets from other ports be used by Shanghai restaurants to purchase rice in Shanghai after they have collected them? Or do rice shops accumulate a certain number of tickets and then exchange them with other ports? This is indeed a problem. Therefore, unless the entire country implements population-based rationing, and the quantity and price are the same, the implementation of the rice ticket system is not easy to say.

In summary, we sincerely ask the authorities to consider implementing the following points:

(1) Increase the amount of rations per person and improve the quality of the rations, so that every citizen does not have to half starve.

(2) Thoroughly allow peddlers to carry rice into the city for sale, but limit the appropriate selling price.

(3) Open up the interior, and encourage the authorities to encourage businesses to transport rice to Shanghai to provide a steady supply.

In short, we believe that the food problem in Shanghai is a serious problem that directly affects the interests of all citizens, and has a close and significant impact on the political, economic, and security situation in Shanghai and peaceful areas. We hope that the authorities will act swiftly and thoroughly to seek thorough remedies and fundamental solutions.

### Deadline for Cloth Registration; Investigation to Begin Soon; Numerous Entries Prevented Full Accommodation; Schedule Fixed for Completion Within Five Days

A notice from the Intelligence Department of the Public Works Department states: Since the Bureau began processing cloth registration on the 10th of this month, the process has been relatively smooth. The registration process is limited to the 15th of this month. All relevant persons who have not yet registered must come to the Bureau for registration before the evening of this day and must not delay any further. Goods not registered after the deadline will be confiscated once discovered, and the owners will be penalized. Furthermore, the inventory registration information must be accurate. If any inaccuracies are found, the same regulations as mentioned above will be applied.

Registration Receipts Must Be Preserved

The Bureau intends to send personnel to investigate the accuracy of the registered inventory. Therefore, any relevant person who ignores this registration matter will inevitably incur serious consequences. The Bureau will issue a registration receipt to each registrant. This receipt must be properly preserved, as it is absolutely necessary for the future sale of cloth and can also be used as proof that the goods have been registered in accordance with regulations when Bureau investigators come to investigate the inventory.

Inability to Process; Numbers Assigned

According to a notice from the Intelligence Department of the Public Works Department, the Bureau recently issued Notice No. 6204, stating that all those who came to the Bureau to register cloth inventory but could not be accommodated on the 14th due to the large number of people have been temporarily assigned a number by the Bureau. Persons with this number should follow the schedule below and return to the Bureau to complete the registration procedures on the specified dates within this month:

Numbers 1001 to 2000: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 15th

Numbers 2001 to 2600: 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 15th

Numbers 2601 to 3200: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 16th

Numbers 3201 to 3800: 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 16th

Numbers 3801 to 4400: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 17th

Numbers 4401 to 5000: 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 17th

Numbers 5001 to 5600: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 18th

Numbers 5601 to 6200: 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 18th

Numbers 6201 to 7000: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 19th

Registration Procedures for Pledged Cloth

A notice from the United Association of Silver Shops to its members states: Regarding the Public Works Department's announcement setting a deadline for the registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the Association issued a notice on the 3rd of this month. Regarding the registration procedures, the Association has now inquired with the responsible person of the Bureau. All cotton yarn exceeding 400 pounds and cotton cloth exceeding 40 "pi" stored as of 5:00 PM on the 10th of this month must be registered by the owner before the 15th. In addition to registering their own goods, each shop should notify the mortgagors to directly register the pledged cloth (those whose warehouse receipts are under the shop's name should still be registered by the owner). After the mortgagor completes the registration, they should notify the pledgee of the registration certificate number for verification. As for the registration of warehouses, there is no specific form. The warehouses only need to register at the same time the type, quantity, warehouse receipt number, consignor's name, and contact information of the stored cloth.

Submit Cloth Samples for Review

A notice from the Dyeing, Weaving, and Cotton Cloth Industry Association states: This Association is now collecting trademarks and cloth samples from member factories for the registration of processed cotton cloth (including dyed and finished cloth) in order to forward them for review and facilitate sales in the market. Members are requested to collect forms from their respective associations within three days, fill them out truthfully, and submit them to the Association by the 18th of this month. This matter is in the interest of the members themselves, so please do not hesitate and delay, lest you miss the opportunity.

### Fundraising for the Pushan Villa

Regular Beijing Opera Performances Scheduled

The Pushan Villa in this city has a history of thirty years since its establishment by Mr. Wang Junsheng. It is now co-sponsored by Mr. Yuan Ludeng, President of the Leshan Society in Shanghai, as well as Le Genbao, Li Wencai, Li Xiaobao, Wu Rend, Ma Ziyun, and all members of the Society, to hold voluntary Beijing Opera performances, inviting famous actors, talented young women, and prominent ladies to perform grand performances at the Queen's Theatre on Yu Qiaqing Road on the 17th of this month. The ticket prices are divided into several types, including honorary seats for 100 yuan, and ordinary seats for 50 yuan, 30 yuan, 20 yuan, and 10 yuan. All income from the performances will be used to fund the charitable expenses of the Villa.

### Agreement Reached on Coal Imports; Coal Prices to Be Fixed; Coal from Central China Can Now Be Imported in Large Quantities; French Authorities to Severely Punish Illegal Shops

According to the English-language *Shanghai Times*, a senior official from the Price Control Office of the French Municipal Council revealed that the price of coal by the "jin" will be fixed in the near future, and the authorities have also reached an agreement with the authorities in Central China to import coal in large quantities.

Coal Prices Based on Quality

It is said that the price of coal per ton will be determined according to its quality, ranging from 704 yuan to 874 yuan. The best quality coal can be sold for 874 yuan per ton, while coal produced in Shandong will be set at 704 yuan per ton. It is also said that the agreement between the authorities on the large-scale import of coal has been completed.

Continued Difficulties in Controlling Vegetable Prices

Regarding the turmoil in vegetable prices in recent weeks, the official stated that this is one of the most difficult problems for the authorities to control prices. Vegetable prices must be determined entirely by the conditions of the farmland around Shanghai, such as harvest supply and demand and yarn transportation. For example, the price increase of potatoes is due to the recent sudden cooling of the weather, which has reduced the production of potatoes transported from the suburbs to the concessions. Although speculation is also a factor in price increases, natural causes can indeed increase vegetable prices.

### The Control Committee Purchases New Cotton and Implements the Rationing System; An Agreement Is Reached With the Jiangsu Construction Bureau Regarding Purchase Methods; Sino-Japanese Textile Factories Sell at Limited Prices

In order to control the purchase of cotton in peaceful areas and implement a rationing system, the Central China Cotton Control Committee allocates cotton to textile factories in Shanghai, Nantong, Suzhou, Wujin, Taicang, and Wuxi as raw materials for spinning yarn and weaving cloth. Now, cotton companies in southern Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu have been established one after another to purchase cotton in designated areas according to the limited prices set by the Control Committee. An agreement has been reached with the Jiangsu Construction Bureau regarding purchase methods to absolutely eliminate illegal activities such as adulteration. As for prices, the limited prices must be followed. It is reported that the cotton already collected in various places, in addition to being allocated to local textile factories, has been shipped to Shanghai, and it is allocated to the Sino-Japanese textile factories and military-managed factories in Shanghai according to their actual needs. The factories have been supplied with raw materials in order to increase production, and they will gradually restore the yarn spindles. As for the spun yarn, it will be sold according to the maximum limited prices of cloth announced by the authorities.

130,000 "Dan" Have Been Collected in Various Places

From the 1st to the 10th of this month, 130,000 "dan" of cotton have been collected in various places, of which 10,000 "dan" have been shipped to Shanghai and allocated to various factories for use as raw materials. It is reported that Japanese merchants such as Rihwa, Obun, Toyota, Yufeng, and Tohwa in Shanghai, as well as Chinese merchants such as Shenxin, Wing On, Xinyu, Hongzhang, Hefeng, Gong Yongbao, Fengqin, and military-managed factories, have been supplied with raw materials and are increasing production, first restoring the spindles that were previously reduced, and then gradually restoring the number of workers depending on the actual sales of cloth. The spun yarn is sold according to the maximum limited prices of cloth stipulated by the authorities.

Shanghai Cotton Management Area to Establish Breeding Grounds

In order to promote the increase in cotton production, the Ministry of Industry plans to establish cotton seed breeding grounds in the Shanghai, northern Jiangsu, and Nanjing management areas to promote the improvement of cotton production quality. It is learned that the Shanghai Cotton Industry Management Area Office of the Ministry has already planned to select and purchase 600 "dan" of high-quality cotton seeds from Jiangyin and set up breeding grounds in the three locations of Beiqiao, Chongming, and Nanhui in Shanghai.

### Winter Sanitation Campaign Convention to Be Held Today

In order to promote public health among citizens, the municipal government will hold a winter sanitation campaign convention at 10:00 AM today (the 15th). The convention venue will be located in the assembly hall of the Confucian Temple on Wenmiao Road in the southern city. The mayor has been invited to serve as the chairman of the convention. Representatives from various friendly organizations, bureau chiefs, heads of various agencies, neighborhood chiefs, students, and others will attend. The winter sanitation campaign convention will include health exhibitions, health check-ups, and lectures.

### Financial Office Implements Inspections of Business Operations

In accordance with the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions" and its implementing regulations, silver shops and other financial institutions are required to pay a fixed amount of current deposit reserve funds in order to protect depositors. The institutions have already paid the reserve funds into the designated reserve accounts at the Central Reserve Bank based on the deposit amounts at the end of November. It is reported that the Financial and Military Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in order to supervise the operations of the financial institutions, will send personnel to inspect the assets, liabilities, and business operations of each institution in accordance with the laws and regulations. Any institutions found to be violating the laws and regulations or conducting illegal business activities will be corrected and dealt with according to law.

### Dispute Over Capital Increase at Tong Yi Trust Company

Recently, there has been a surge in enthusiasm for Chinese shares. Newly established companies are springing up like mushrooms after rain, and companies undergoing capital increases and reorganizations are also numerous. Recently, a dispute over a capital increase at the Tong Yi Trust Company on Beijing Road has resulted in a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special Court. The plaintiffs are Hong Ji and others, representing Le Shinong and others, and the defendants are the standing directors of the company.

Resolution Deemed Invalid

The cause of the lawsuit is illegal capital increase and infringement of shareholders' rights. The plaintiffs request that the resolution on the capital increase and the resolutions of the old and new shareholders' meetings on the capital increase be declared invalid, that the newly elected directors and supervisors should immediately cease their activities, that the company should be restored to its state before August 23, and that the costs of the lawsuit should be borne. The main point is that in 1936, the company was declared bankrupt by the court for embezzling more than 1.3 million public debt certificates deposited by depositors. Later, a settlement plan was established to turn the original creditors into shareholders.

Infringement of Old Shareholders' Rights

The company resumed operations in 1938 and has been in business for five years. Commodity prices have soared, and the company's assets have exceeded the total capital by three to four times. The shareholders believe that the previous losses can now be compensated. Unexpectedly, the company's responsible persons, i.e., the defendants, took advantage of the fact that the old shareholders were scattered all over the country and convened a shareholders' meeting in August. Because the legal quorum was not met, they made a false resolution on the capital increase issue, authorizing the board of directors to be responsible for handling it. The capital was increased by 1.5 million, and in October, the directors and supervisors were re-elected. Of the 20 members, the new shareholders accounted for 17. Assuming that the capital of the old shareholders was 100 units and the company's assets were 3 million, the old shareholders could earn 2 million. Now, 1.5 million new shares are added, which can be jointly distributed with the previous surplus. Therefore, the plaintiffs request the above. The case was heard yesterday morning, and after an interrogation, it was decided to reschedule the hearing.

Business News

### Textile Stocks Fall First Along With Yarn Prices

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market first rose and then suddenly fell back. In the end, the gains barely exceeded the losses. Initially, it flourished on the momentum of the previous weekend. Around 10:30, it was suddenly shrouded in unfavorable rumors, and as yarn prices fell, the textile industry took the first hit. Other stocks also fell accordingly. Public utilities had many twists and turns. Zhabei Water and Electricity plunged from 66.75 yuan to 4.5 yuan, closing at 4 yuan. Chinese Electrical Engineering retreated from 46 yuan to 4.5 yuan, closing at 45 yuan, still up 1.5 yuan. Great China Match was always being bought and rose 17.5 yuan, reaching 375 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco remained steady between 127 and 128 yuan. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Five Continents Pharmacy had few sales and rose 25 yuan, reaching 550 yuan, but it was not easy to buy. Most of the others were flat or sluggish. Among the Sino-French small stocks, Xinyi fell 15 yuan to 275 yuan. Sinya broke through the 70 yuan mark again, seeing an unprecedented high price of 71.5 yuan, but then quickly retreated 3 yuan, closing at 69 yuan with few buyers. Minyi traded around 90 yuan, all seeing flat settlements. Star Perfume had a transaction at 232.5 yuan. Among the cultural stocks, only Commercial Press rose 5 yuan to 465 yuan. China traded between 205 yuan and 210 yuan. The World traded around 116 yuan, each up or down 2 yuan. In the department store sector, Wing On, Sincere, and China General Merchandise all rose by 1 or 2 yuan. Wing On once touched 140 yuan. Sincere retreated immediately after breaking through 150 yuan. China General Merchandise was at 82 yuan. China Underwear also rose 1.25 yuan, reaching 35.25 yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile once soared to 1,980 yuan, then retreated to 1,920 yuan, still up 20 yuan. Small-denomination stocks only saw Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving rise to 16 yuan. Hongsheng and Great China Weaving each advanced within 10 yuan. Ningbo Weaving was only at 8 yuan, already below par. Other stocks were mostly flat. The trading was not dull. The list is shown below.

### Public Debt Trading Scanty

Public debt trading remained without formal buying or selling. Transactions were extremely scarce, and prices varied widely, with no consistency. Yesterday, the C bond once reached 8 yuan, but it also traded at 6 yuan. A more realistic price was 7.45 yuan. There was not much difference between A and C bonds. B bonds were at 55 or 56 yuan, D bonds were from 2.5 yuan to 4 yuan, and E bonds were at 55 yuan. The public debt situation seems to be fading away.

### One Day Left in Registration Deadline; Piece Goods Weak and Unbearable

Factory Cloth: The market for factory cloth yesterday was weak due to the deadline for registering cloth inventory being only today. Retailers continued to sell off in order to avoid the trouble of registering, so the market was weak. White cotton cloth and coarse cloth from local factories had few sales, and asking prices varied, seemingly entering a standstill state. The midday closing price for Peach Blossom Lady's and Factory-branded single-color cloth was 301.5 yuan, but the spot price rose to 304 yuan. There were still few supplies.

East Cloth: The market also rose first and then fell, and trading was exceptionally quiet. The midday closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 191 yuan, down 1.5 yuan. The bank price was 190.5 yuan, Colorful Ball was 191 yuan, and Yanghe was 190 yuan. The opening price for Four Gentlemen serge was 7.65 yuan, rising to 7.73 yuan, but then fell to 7.55 yuan due to sales by retailers outside the industry. However, the spot price on the floor was 7.7 yuan with buyers, which was also an anomaly.

### Gold Jewelry Exchange Rate Unchanged; Intra-Industry Bidding Slightly Higher

Yesterday, the Shanghai silversmith industry's Daxin Tonghang gold jewelry retail price remained at 3,350 yuan per tael (purchase price reduced by two hundred and several tens of yuan). Unofficial inter-dealer trading occurred at 3,220 yuan, up 50 yuan. Buying momentum pushed the highest price to 3,280 yuan, stabilizing at noon, and finally settling at 3,260 yuan, 90 yuan higher than last Saturday, with a range of 60 yuan. Trading was thin. Silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael, with Hengfu listed at 18 yuan. Intra-industry trading prices ranged between 18 and 15 yuan.

Yesterday, the bill market showed little change. The intra-industry buying and selling price remained consistently between 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li, and 5 hao. The cash price was around 5 fen. Banks and small money shops quoted buying and selling prices between 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, 5 li, and 6 fen.

### British and American Discount Cigarettes to be Widely Sold

Cigarette trading continued outside the market, but the market was lower compared to the weekend. This was because British and American discount cigarettes would soon be widely sold, distributed to retailers by major A and B grade dealers in the city. This significantly dampened market sentiment, causing prices to stop rising and become weak. "Big British" brand traded at 9,150 yuan, "Old Knife" brand at 8,300 yuan, "Pinhai" brand at 8,100 yuan, "Wuhua" brand at 6,400 yuan, "Fairy" brand at 7,500 yuan, with small fluctuations of 100-200 yuan. Japanese cigarettes: "Golden Spear" brand at 3,000 yuan, "Golden Mansion" at 3,450 yuan, "Red Rose" at 2,700 yuan, "All Luck" brand at 3,100 yuan, "Guide" brand at 2,300 yuan. Domestic cigarettes: "Pyramid" at 6,400 yuan, "Beauty" at 5,900 yuan, "Golden Mouse" at 3,900 yuan. The trend remains stable.

### Local Factory Woolen Cloth Production Decreases

Circulating woolen cloth is increasingly scarce because imports have been cut off for a long time. Local factories lack raw materials; even scraps of wool and hair are hard to find. Consequently, the output of both Chinese and Japanese factories is decreasing rather than increasing. However, due to continuous actual sales and widespread hoarding, prices are rising steadily, with a brisk and unusual trend.

Special Issue on Health Campaign

### The Significance of the Health Campaign

— Chen Gongbo

Today is the day our city holds its winter health campaign. While most people understand the importance of health campaigns to some extent, many fail to grasp it deeply. Those with a superficial understanding often believe that health simply means cleanliness, and that cleanliness only requires a clean surface. Little do they know that health issues are related to the health of the nation and can affect the rise and fall of the country!

It should be understood that the people are the elements that constitute the country. If all the people are healthy in body and mind, then all political constructions can achieve sound development, making it easy to bring the country into a realm of prosperity and strength. Looking back at our country's situation, although we have a population of 400 million, if health checks were conducted using scientific standards, the number of those who would be eliminated would probably be considerable, wouldn't it?

This is not an intentional exaggeration to cause alarm, but rather based on factual evidence. For example, our country's mortality rate is twice that of civilized countries, resulting in the needless sacrifice of six million people each year. And the number of citizens who are chronically ill, unable to produce, and in need of relief, although there are no accurate statistics, must be considerable. These unfavorable conditions are all weaknesses of the country. To correct these weaknesses one by one, the country and the nation can be saved.

Although the work of saving the country is not limited to health, health should be the priority: because health is the mother of all undertakings. Without a healthy people as the foundation, everything is empty talk. We now need to save the country through peace, but empty talk will not help. It is hoped that after this winter health campaign, everyone will know the importance of health. On an individual level, clothing, food, housing, and transportation must all comply with health standards. In terms of public health, everyone should rise up to maintain and organize it together. The municipal government is very attentive to the popularization of health education in order to encourage citizens to pay attention to and practice health. The Nanshi district is the first health education experimental zone, and in the future, all districts will uniformly promote health education. Today's health campaign is one method of promoting health education. It is hoped that all citizens of the city will study health and practice health. This is the basic work of saving the country, and only then can saving the country through peace succeed, and we can shoulder the responsibility of building a Greater East Asia and fulfill our great mission!

### To Prevent Smallpox, Vaccination is a Must

Cause: Smallpox (i.e., variola) is caused by infection with a natural smallpox virus. It is most likely to spread in the spring and winter seasons. Once discovered, anyone in close proximity to the patient is very likely to be infected through contact.

Main Symptoms: After an incubation period of ten to fourteen days after infection, there are prodromal symptoms such as chills, fever, headache, vomiting, pain in the limbs, delirium, drowsiness, cough, shortness of breath, and inflammation of the eyes and throat. Soon, smallpox lesions appear all over the face, torso, and limbs. At the same time, important organs such as the heart, brain, and nerves are affected by the smallpox virus, often leading to dangerous complications and death!

Prevention and Treatment: The only effective way to prevent it is to get vaccinated quickly! Increase the body's resistance to the virus to avoid harm; if it unfortunately occurs, it should be sent to a contagious isolation hospital for diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible to avoid the danger of spreading to the whole family or neighbors. Given that winter is a period when smallpox easily spreads, it is hoped that the public will pay close attention to it and not neglect the importance of vaccination!

### The Sage Treats Unborn Disease

— Zhao Zunhuo

### The Purpose of the Health Campaign

— Mei

The purpose of the health campaign is to popularize health education and promote public health. This is the basic work of strengthening the country and the people. However, the meaning of health is very broad, and the departments involved are very complex. It is by no means enough for the government to simply promote health campaigns to fulfill the duties of public health. It can only be said that the promotion of public health should start with health campaigns. Public health includes various sciences, but our people, apart from general experts, have not only not studied public health, but probably do not have a full understanding of ordinary health knowledge. To enable the people to understand ordinary health knowledge, it all depends on the promotion of health education, and holding health campaigns is one way to promote health education. Because health campaigns use various propaganda methods to make the people aware of the importance of health. For example, thorough cleaning can make people aware that dirt is harmful to health; careful eating and drinking can make people aware of fewer diseases; preventive injections can resist the spread of epidemics; eliminating mosquitoes and flies can reduce the spread of epidemics, etc. All health knowledge should enable the people to move from awareness to attention, and from attention to practice. By gradually extending it from a small number of people to a large number and seeking its universality, the health campaign can be considered valuable, health education can have results, and the purpose of promoting public health can be achieved. Because the public has universally received health education, they can understand the importance of public health, and all health undertakings will be easily promoted. Once promoted without obstruction, the level of personal health can be improved, and the life span of human beings can be extended. Personal health can be improved to increase the strength of the entire nation; at the same time, the ability of people to produce can be increased, reducing the huge and intangible consumption of the economy, and the prosperity of the country can be expected. Therefore, it is no mistake to say that the health campaign is the beginning of strengthening the country and the people.

### Be Careful of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

Cause

When coal burns, a odorless, tasteless, and highly toxic gas (chemical name carbon monoxide) is produced. More of it is produced when burning is not vigorous. If the concentration of carbon monoxide in the indoor air is more than 0.5%, it can be fatal. In winter, if you take fire for heating, you should take precautions or there may be a tragic change of carbon monoxide poisoning.

Prevention

(1) When burning coal, it should be burned vigorously in a ventilated and open place before being brought into the room.

(2) If it is an immovable stove, the windows and doors should be opened when burning coal.

(3) When a coal stove or fireplace is burning in the room, the windows or doors should be opened as appropriate, at least for three to five minutes every hour, in order to exchange air.

(4) A kettle or basin of water should be placed on the stove.

(5) Do not burn a stove in the room after going to bed.

First aid

If, unfortunately, you have already been poisoned by coal, quickly open the windows and immediately move the patient to a place with plenty of air. At the same time, quickly ask a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. If the patient has difficulty breathing or weak breathing, perform artificial respiration immediately.

### Beware of Diphtheria

Cause

Due to the invasion of diphtheria bacilli. For example, eating, sleeping, sitting together, or talking face-to-face with patients, or using bowls and chopsticks together can all be transmitted, and it is especially fond of invading children under the age of ten.

Main Symptoms

Two to seven days after the bacterium invades, a membrane forms in the throat or nasal cavity, causing difficulty in swallowing, swelling and pain in the cervical glands, difficulty in breathing, and hoarseness. If medical treatment is not sought immediately, death will occur due to blood poisoning.

Prevention

Do not get close to patients or share utensils to avoid infection. Children without the disease can undergo the Schick test first. If unfortunately infected with diphtheria, seek medical attention immediately.

### What We Should Know About the Health Campaign

— Shiliang

Thirty years ago, apart from a few people with new knowledge who could understand the word "health", the general public did not know what health was. In recent years, although the word "health" has been known to everyone, what is the meaning of health? How important is health? I am afraid that the general public has not yet deeply understood it!

Holding a health campaign is to awaken the general public's attention to health. It can also be said that it is a concrete manifestation of promoting health education. This kind of movement is rarely seen internationally. Because the education level of the general public in our country is low, the government must promote health campaigns to encourage the public to pay attention to health.

The completion of public health must be based on personal health. Because the conditions for personal health are relatively easy to achieve, anyone who has received education can always understand some health knowledge, and can maintain at least personal health. However, relying solely on a narrow definition of personal health while neglecting family health and social health is still not thorough. If you encounter the spread of infectious diseases, you still cannot avoid the danger of infection. Especially those who only value private morality and disregard public morality, pay attention to cleanliness on their own bodies, but can ignore it in their families, or pay attention to cleanliness at home, but do not pay attention to public health, and dump garbage, mud, feces, and sewage from their own homes on the road, hindering public health. This kind of behavior is really too naive, and the result is still hindering themselves. Because the occurrence of infectious diseases is caused by these many wastes, especially in summer, the bacteria contained in these many garbage, after the evaporation of the sun or the medium of mosquitoes and flies, infectious diseases are naturally easy to occur. For example, once cholera breaks out and spreads, it is extremely fast. Once a person gets sick, it can immediately infect everyone in the neighborhood, even a town, a county, a province, or a country. To investigate the reasons, it is all due to the people's lack of health knowledge, so the government must promote health campaigns to make the people of the whole country pay attention to the importance of health.

The purpose of the health campaign is to reduce diseases, so that all citizens have a healthy body, increase life expectancy, and do the great cause of enriching the country and strengthening the people. To achieve this goal, we must all take on the responsibility of transforming environmental hygiene, cleaning up road garbage, removing household waste, cleaning toilets and kitchens, and eliminating mosquitoes and flies. This is the most important work in improving environmental hygiene, but this kind of work will never be successful by holding a health campaign once. The health campaign is just to take advantage of this day to awaken the general public to have a real understanding of the word "health", and to promote everyone to develop healthy habits, which can protect the life safety of the public, and at the same time reduce the disease rate and mortality rate. However, health work is not a one-sided matter for the people, nor can it be done solely by the power of the government. We must cooperate with each other to achieve the health of the people, the happiness of society, and the prosperity of the country.

### A Letter to the Citizens for the First Winter Health Campaign in Our City

— Yuan Jufan

Citizens:

Now the winter health campaign has opened again. When it comes to health issues, all knowledgeable citizens recognize its importance. But the general public often has some misunderstandings, thinking that during the summer epidemic, we should pay attention to health, but as the weather turns cooler, gradually from autumn to winter, the epidemic disappears, and the threat to life has been lifted, so we can rest easy.

In fact, health problems cannot be neglected at any time. Although several kinds of bacteria are easy to breed in summer and can kill people in an instant, there are also some bacteria that are not afraid of the cold and still threaten our lives in winter, such as smallpox, typhoid fever, bacillary dysentery, influenza, upper respiratory tract inflammation and other diseases, which can also spread in winter, so I hope everyone will pay attention to prevention.

The method of health should be cleanliness as the first priority. If the body and environment are clean and tidy, the bacteria will have nowhere to parasitize and multiply. If we have not developed the habit of loving cleanliness, we do not change our clothes often, do not trim our hair often, nor do we take baths often, it is easy to parasitize fleas and lice, and spread diseases such as plague, typhus, recurrent fever, and trench fever. Also, spitting and defecating indiscriminately, or dumping garbage indiscriminately, not only damages the city's appearance and willingly exposes unhygienic bad habits, bringing shame to the nation and the country, but also spreads bacteria such as tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and dysentery, endangering national health and affecting the national economy.

I hope that citizens will recognize the meaning and value of health, and examine themselves to see if they have developed the necessary health habits in terms of personal health? Has family health been improved? Have the rules of public health been followed? If everyone can pay attention to these issues and put them into practice, individuals can be healthy, families can be happy, and the country can be strong.

Therefore, when we hold this health campaign, please pay attention to health issues, thoroughly wash away all past unhygienic habits, and re-establish a healthy and happy outlook on life, so as to achieve our expected goals and complete the great mission of strengthening the country and the people. This is the sincere hope of our association for all citizens!

### Thoughts on the Winter Health Campaign Conference

— Yuan Houzhi

The first winter health campaign conference in our city was held on December 15th, which is indeed an urgent matter. Although the three aspects of morality, intelligence, and physical education are said to be equally important, the physical aspect is actually the main one. If the physique is weak, or even if death does not exist, even if there is morality and intelligence, what is the use of it? If Yan Yuan had morality but died young, or if Ran Boniu had a serious illness, even though morality was in the body and not applied to others, what is the value of having it? The same is true for intelligence. Jia Yi had the talent of Wang Zuo, but only lived to be thirty-three years old; Li He's poetry was unmatched, but he was only twenty-seven years old. They all ended their lives prematurely and did not complete their use. However, if the American Edison lived to be eighty-five years old, and his important invention, the electric light, has benefited all mankind to this day, then it was mostly after the age of forty-nine. Also, if the German Roentgen lived to seventy-nine, and his invention of X-rays was already at the age of fifty-one. If these two people had only lived as long as Jia Yi and Li He, how could they have had this? If the skin does not exist, where will the hair be attached? This is the natural principle. Although a person's life is predestined, those who are good at nourishing themselves have a way to maintain their health, and it is not impossible to conquer nature with human effort. As Ji Shuye said, "If you cultivate in the time of soup, even if you have the merit of one watering, although you will eventually return to scorching heat, you must be watered before you wither." The most common and widespread disease among our people is tuberculosis, almost nine out of ten people suffer from it. According to the weekly reports of the Shanghai Concession Public Health Office on the mortality rate of the people, those who die from tuberculosis often account for more than 70%. However, it is not impossible to prevent it. In European and American countries with the most flourishing culture and science, the tuberculosis mortality rate has been reduced to less than 10%. Other diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and red and white dysentery are all caused by dietary imbalances and bacterial activity. Those with severe cases die, and those with mild cases become seriously ill. If they knew a little about hygiene, did not eat food contaminated by flies, did not drink unclean water, and dressed and lived in accordance with their needs, how could this have happened? Although it is said that when diseases come, there are medicines that can cure them. However, medicine treats what has already happened. Rather than treating what has already happened, it is better to prevent it before it happens. As for planning ahead and preventing diseases in the subtle, it is hygiene that is valued. Medicine is for those who are burnt out, and moving the chimney is hygiene. Medicine is the end, and hygiene is the root. If hygiene is effective, and everyone can know and practice it, then how can diseases occur? Naturally, everyone will be healthy and ascend to longevity. Medicine can only be used as an auxiliary tool. Since the implementation of the health campaign in our city, the summer cholera, although it was very rampant at first, was soon extinguished and did not become a major problem due to effective treatment and thorough prevention, treating both the symptoms and the root cause, and treating both internally and externally. Other measures such as tuberculosis prevention have also been implemented in every detail. Now we will ban spitting everywhere, which is an essential step. As for winter health, the first priority is to widely vaccinate against smallpox. A strong country must first have a strong people. How can there be a nation that does not pay attention to hygiene, is weak and diseased, and still be able to strengthen its country? From now on, morality and intelligence will also be promoted equally through sports. In this way, the three aspects of education will flourish, not only will everyone have a healthy physique, and good birth can be achieved, but also morality and wisdom will flow and advance together. Is it only strengthening the people? The strength of the country can be as sure as holding a ticket. At the beginning of the first winter health campaign conference, I would like to record a few words to express my feelings, and I would like to recite Du Fu's poem "Eight sides open up longevity, one breath turns Hongjun" to be a congratulatory message.

Today is a special issue for the "First Winter Health Campaign Conference in Our City", and Free Talk will be suspended for one day and will be published as usual tomorrow.
