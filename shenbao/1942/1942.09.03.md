Ankara, 2nd – Reuters: A report from Cairo states that General Rommel's troops have broken through the heavily mined British defenses in North Africa, advancing eight miles.

Berlin, 2nd – Reuters: Today's German war report states that German and Italian mechanized units attacked British positions on the Egyptian front, destroying 30 enemy armored vehicles. From August 31st to September 1st, German and Italian aircraft shot down 51 British planes, and anti-aircraft guns shot down 4. German submarines sank a 4,000-ton enemy ship in the Mediterranean.

Rome, 2nd – Reuters: Today's Italian war report states that German and Italian mechanized units attacked along the Egyptian front yesterday, destroying 30 enemy tanks.

British aircraft attacked Sicily, strafing passenger trains with machine guns. The Italian Navy sank an enemy submarine. One Italian submarine has not returned to its base.

Berlin, 2nd – Reuters: This morning, local newspapers are maintaining a cautious silence regarding the reported new German offensive at El Alamein. However, the front page of "Völkischer Beobachter" features a portrait of Field Marshal Rommel in a gesture of respect.

Stockholm, 2nd – Reuters: According to reports from London, Reuters correspondent Wallin, embedded with the British Eighth Army, issued a special dispatch last night acknowledging that German troops under Field Marshal Rommel have broken through British minefields at El Alamein. Progress after the German breakthrough has been "slow and cautious."

### Fierce Battles on Himeimat Mountain, German and American Forces to Engage

Stockholm, 2nd – Reuters: News from the Egyptian front received in London states that fighting is currently concentrated around Himeimat, approximately ten kilometers south of Qattara. British sources believe that this is a strategic diversion by the Germans to distract from their main objective. The Egyptian campaign is still in its early stages, and a major battle is imminent.

Stockholm, 2nd – Reuters: According to Swedish newspaper reports, British newspapers are headlining Rommel's new offensive on the southern flank of the El Alamein line. London indicates that British and Allied forces are prepared for any eventuality. American forces are also ready to assist if necessary, meaning that American and German forces will engage for the first time since World War I. British military correspondents are currently focused on describing the details of the theater of operations and the center of the fighting on El Himeimat Mountain (reaching 100 meters in height). London believes that Field Marshal Rommel will attempt a flanking maneuver or use paratroopers to attack the rear of the British lines and will also land troops from the sea east of the British positions. Rommel is once again attempting the impossible. It is rumored that he has received reinforcements of one German and one Italian division each. The development of the situation will become clear in a few days.

Bern, 2nd – Havas News Agency: According to reports from Berlin, German military circles have made no comment on the new offensive by German and Italian forces in North Africa, but do not deny that German forces in North Africa have received substantial reinforcements in the past two months. London states that this move by the Germans is not surprising, but it is not yet clear whether this action is the beginning of a large-scale offensive or a localized battle preceding a major offensive. A London dispatch in the Swiss newspaper, "Tages-Anzeiger," states that British sources acknowledge that since the stabilization of the Egyptian front in July, German forces have received significant reinforcements, replacing losses suffered in the Libyan and Egyptian campaigns, and have been reinforced by one fresh German and one Italian division. While details of the reinforcements received by British Generals Alexander and Montgomery are unknown, the strength of the two opposing forces is clearly equal. However, British sources are feeling considerable anxiety about the current German offensive. The Axis forces are now less than 120 miles from their frontline objectives, making a strategic withdrawal impossible for the British. If the German offensive succeeds, it will have significant implications. Conversely, if the British prevail, it will only temporarily offset the German advantage. The British might inflict a major setback on the Germans, but it cannot be said that North Africa will immediately be entirely free of the Axis threat. As Prime Minister Churchill stated, this victory must be achieved by the British Eighth Army.

### Hori Discusses Togo's Resignation, Unrelated to Foreign Policy; Prime Minister Tojo's Concurrent Appointment is Temporary, Yamamoto Appointed Acting Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs

Tokyo, 2nd – Domei News Agency: Following Foreign Minister Togo's resignation and Prime Minister Tojo's concurrent appointment to the position, General Tojo told reporters last night that the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry aims to promote the construction of Greater East Asia, which is the key to Japan's victory.

Tokyo, 2nd – Domei News Agency: Information Bureau Spokesperson Hori told foreign correspondents today that Foreign Minister Togo's resignation was entirely due to personal reasons and has absolutely no relation to the Cabinet's establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry or Japan's foreign policy. Although it is difficult to predict how long Prime Minister Tojo will concurrently hold the position of Foreign Minister, it is generally understood that this is a temporary arrangement.

Tokyo, 2nd – Domei News Agency: Prime Minister Tojo, who concurrently held the position of Minister of War, now also holds the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Well-informed sources here believe that this move will unify Japan's military, diplomatic, and administrative functions and strengthen Japan's relations with Germany and Italy and promote the construction of Greater East Asia.

Tokyo, 2nd – Domei News Agency: Officials announced last night that following Foreign Minister Togo's resignation, he has been appointed as a member of the House of Peers by the Emperor.

This will simplify the cumbersome and overlapping agencies that existed in the past. The status and duties of personnel at each local agency, such as ambassadors, will be directed and supervised by the Minister of Greater East Asia. However, purely diplomatic matters will still be under the direction and supervision of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The division of responsibilities will be clear and without confusion.

### Bitter Fighting Between German and Soviet Forces, Contending for Cities and Water, Unprecedentedly Fierce Battles in Stalingrad

Moscow, 2nd – Domei News Agency: The battle for Stalingrad in southern Russia is raging fiercely. Beyond artillery fire, the scorching sun adds to the hardship. Both sides are contending not only for the city but also for water. Water sources are scarce in the war zone. Soviet soldiers have only enough water for two days per person. German soldiers must be suffering even more as a result. After a day of fierce fighting, as the sun sets, the two armies are engaged in a continuous struggle for water under the starlight. In one sector, there is only one well located in no man's land between the two lines. Every night, each side sends troops to occupy the well, extracting as much water as possible. One night, German forces even used several tanks to protect the well, while transport vehicles were filled with water and driven away. Soviet soldiers in that area had not had water for 48 hours. This illustrates that while the battle for Stalingrad is extremely important, the battle for water wells is also crucial.

Rome, 1st – Havas News Agency: Correspondents from Berlin report that the battle for Stalingrad has reached its final stage, but it is difficult to predict how long it will last. German forces have broken into the outer defenses of the city and are now attacking the inner defenses. However, the enemy is still holding firm in fortified positions. Moreover, the Red Army possesses a large number of the latest weapons. Furthermore, the Red Army High Command is sending a continuous stream of fresh troops to reinforce Stalingrad. The battle is still in progress, and the intensity of the fighting is unprecedented. Particularly on the southern side of Stalingrad, fierce hand-to-hand combat is taking place. German artillery and air force are continuously bombing the outskirts of Stalingrad, causing massive fires throughout the city. The city appears to be completely surrounded by German forces. German forces have reached the Volga River at one point. This has been confirmed. In addition, German heavy artillery has shifted to new positions and is now shelling both banks of the Volga River, preventing Soviet reinforcements from reaching the front lines.

Rome, 2nd – Reuters: Soviet forces have been attacking Italian positions on the Don River for eleven days, relentlessly pushing forward. Soviet commanders are sending reinforcements day and night to break through the Italian defenses and stop the German advance on Stalingrad. The Italian forces bear a difficult and heavy responsibility, with soldiers fighting for over a month without the opportunity to rest. The Soviet offensive strategy alternates between heavy artillery barrages and infantry charges, sometimes leading to bayonet charges and even hand-to-hand combat. The fighting is extremely intense.

### Berlin Officially Announces Yesterday that German Troops Have Reached the Volga River

Berlin, 2nd – Reuters: Today's German war report states that German forces and their allies continue to advance southeast towards Anapa. Soviet forces are stubbornly resisting while holding onto high ground. Our forces are making continued progress in the bitter fighting in Stalingrad. Our spearheads have now reached the Volga River north of Stalingrad. Soviet counterattacks have been repelled. Our artillery has also sunk a 500-ton steamboat in the Volga River. Enemy attacks south of Lake Ladoga were repelled with heavy losses. Our aircraft bombed key railway junctions northwest of Moscow day and night, causing multiple fires. Soviet aircraft attacked residential areas of Warsaw in East Prussia last night, causing multiple fires.

Stockholm, 2nd – Havas News Agency: After eight days of fierce fighting, German and Romanian forces have captured the port of Anapa and reached the eastern coast of the Black Sea and the coastal roads connecting the ports. The vital port of Novorossiysk is threatened from both the east and west, and its position is precarious. The road from Anapa to Novorossiysk is only 25 miles long and is more difficult to traverse than the mountain road from Krasnodar to Anapa. In fact, the strongholds of Novoukrainsky and Novorossijskaya have already fallen, and Axis forces have advanced beyond these two points. The fate of Novorossiysk now depends solely on the strength of the defending forces. It is generally believed that the port will soon fall. At the same time, the issue of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet arises. Most of the warships are currently in the port of Batumi. Berlin believes that the Soviet Union and Turkey are currently negotiating through the United States and Great Britain to allow the Soviet fleet to pass through the Dardanelles. The German Ambassador to Turkey is discussing this matter with the Turkish Prime Minister. German officials deeply believe that Turkey will remain neutral. Therefore, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will either have to be scuttled, captured, or interned in a Turkish port.

### German and Romanian Forces Occupy Anapa, Continuing to Advance Along the Black Sea Coast

Berlin, 2nd – Reuters: German and Romanian forces advancing from the lower reaches of the Kuban River have occupied the Black Sea port of Anapa. This port served as a base for the Soviet Black Sea Fleet and as a point of embarkation for retreating Soviet troops. The only port now available to the Soviets for evacuation is Novorossiysk. However, Novorossiysk is also under German air control, and patrol boats are operating in the harbor. Moreover, German artillery units in Anapa can shell the port. According to the latest reports, German forces have begun an offensive toward Tuapse, approximately 125 kilometers to the south. German forces advancing on Stalingrad continue to make progress, with particularly rapid advances from the south. German forces from the north and west have also "not reduced their offensive." This reservation is an indication that the German High Command is about to announce significant victories. German bombers and fighter planes are increasingly active in the Stalingrad area and have extended their operations east beyond Stalingrad and the Volga River. Axis forces repelled Soviet forces near Akaluga, destroying 860 Soviet tanks. Soviet forces near Rzhev and northwest of Metyng were also repelled. Soviet attacks southeast of Lake Ilmen resulted in the loss of four Soviet tanks. The Soviet breakthrough of German lines at Kholm was repelled. Soviet forces launched repeated attacks, resulting in hand-to-hand combat. Soviet forces lost three tanks. German artillery heavily damaged Soviet forces south of Lake Ladoga. German aircraft assisted in the fighting, successfully bombing Soviet tanks and anti-aircraft batteries. German aircraft conducted armed patrols over the Gulf of Finland, hitting a Soviet minesweeper. German aircraft and anti-aircraft guns shot down twelve Soviet aircraft on the northern part of the Eastern Front.

Berlin, 2nd – Reuters: Anapa, recently occupied by Romanian forces, is a small, ice-free Black Sea port northwest of Novorossiysk. However, its transport capacity is very limited. The city has a population of 15,000 and is known for its beer and other liquor industries. One distillery can produce one million bottles of liquor annually. The area also has sulfur springs, which attract visitors. From the 13th to the 16th centuries, Anapa was a Greek colony. In 1783, the Turks converted the port into a fortress. During the reign of Catherine II, the Russians made great efforts to capture the port. In 1856, the area was ceded to the Russians under the Treaty of Adrianople.

Berlin, 2nd – Havas News Agency: According to intelligence received by the German General Staff, the Red Army is sending reinforcements to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. For example, the troops stationed in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic have been largely transferred north.

### Board Meeting of the Public Works Department Decides to Dissolve the Shanghai Volunteer Corps; Expresses Gratitude for Past Services and Will Recover Uniforms and Equipment of Members

A public announcement from the Intelligence Department of the Public Works Department stated: At the board meeting held yesterday afternoon, the directors unanimously agreed that, given the current situation in Shanghai, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (SVC) is no longer necessary to exist. Therefore, it was resolved to dissolve the SVC. Foreign defense forces stationed in Shanghai and its surrounding areas can adequately maintain the security of the International Settlement, and the training work of the SVC has been indefinitely suspended. Therefore, maintaining the SVC is no longer practical. When resolving to dissolve the SVC, the directors expressed their gratitude for the service provided by all members in the past, especially during times of trouble. The procedures for recovering SVC uniforms and equipment will be announced in a separate document in the near future. The SVC was originally established on April 8, 1853 (during the Taiping Rebellion). At that time, it had fewer than 200 members and was defensive in nature to prevent attacks by the Taiping Army. It was dissolved once and re-recruited in 1860. It was reorganized in 1878. In 1900 (the庚子year), when the Boxer Rebellion broke out, it was completely reorganized to meet the needs of the time, and its strength was expanded from 350 to about 1,000 members. Subsequently, members were repeatedly recruited and the organization was changed. The Japanese Company of the SVC was established in 1900, and the Chinese Company was organized in 1907. SVC members were often called out to assist in maintaining security and were always calm and composed in handling matters, which was commendable. As of November 30, 1941, the SVC had 158 officers and 1,491 members of all ranks, with numerous unit designations, which are omitted for brevity.

### Numerous Notorious Robbers Apprehended in the Two Settlements

Hua Detective Wu Chengmo and Detective Shen Jianwen of the Criminal Division of the Public Works Department learned that several notorious robbers were hiding in the settlements.

After interrogation, the three, Jiang Jinfu (also known as Bao Shi), Zhang Zhenliang (also known as Chen Zhenliang), and Zhang Huaqing, confessed. Following their confession, Zhang Gengxiang from Ningbo was apprehended at 248 Lafayette Road, and a pistol and three bullets were seized. Subsequently, Deng Zhuofu from Shantou was apprehended at 21 Zhengxing Lane, Linin Road, Nanshi. It was found that the suspects had committed many major robbery cases in the settlements.

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that relevant official groups in the city continued to study the current high prices of goods today (2nd). Therefore, it is generally expected that the authorities will soon announce new measures to suppress prices. Regarding the study of prices, officials made no comment this morning. However, sources on the other hand indicated that the authorities are determined to take the strictest action to bring prices down to the old legal tender prices of May 26th to 28th. It is heard that the establishment of the Shanghai Price Control Bureau is continuing to be discussed today. After its establishment, the bureau will exercise its control to suppress the high selling prices of basic goods in the city. It is generally believed that the authorities' plan to suppress prices, which will be announced at the beginning of this week, will target all goods sold in the city's markets. Therefore, it is expected that price limits for various goods will be announced soon. It is also learned today that a central distribution agency for important commodities will be established in the short term, in accordance with price limits. This agency will be similar to the rice and flour control offices established by the authorities of the two settlements. The prices of essential household goods have soared in recent months, greatly affecting residents. It is now heard that the authorities are suppressing prices, and it is hoped that this can alleviate the people's difficulties. However, shopkeepers in general are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the announcement of price controls. It is heard that some are not making large transactions, while others are anticipating a sharp drop in prices and are taking the opportunity to raise prices as much as possible to profit.

### Girl Stabbed to Death After Rejection; Assailant Arrested on the Spot

Xu Guilian, a sixteen-year-old unmarried woman from Ningbo, residing in the front room on the second floor of the Wanmao Soy Sauce Garden at No. 196 Rue Kimpien, worked in a factory. Her fellow townsman Zhang Youqing, 24 years old, lived on the same floor and had been pursuing her due to her beauty. However, Xu rejected him due to his ugliness, causing Zhang to harbor resentment. At 7:30 a.m. yesterday, Zhang ambushed her at the entrance of the next lane as Xu was leaving for work. He suddenly drew a knife and stabbed Xu four times in the back, causing her to bleed profusely and cry for help before collapsing to the ground. Police officers arrived upon hearing the commotion and apprehended Zhang, along with the murder weapon. He was taken into custody at the police station pending further investigation. Xu was sent to the hospital but died from her injuries. Her body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination.

### Guangdong Repatriation Committee's Fifth Repatriation Imminent

The Guangdong Associations in Shanghai Repatriation Committee has repatriated 600 fellow townsmen in three batches two months ago. However, due to a lack of shipping and the prevalence of epidemics, the Dongya Shipping Company voluntarily reduced the number of fourth-class berths. Only twelve fellow townsmen from Shantou who had registered for repatriation were sent out on the 4th of last month by the Hecheng Company. Recently, as the situation has become calmer and the weather is getting cooler, the shipping company has provided the committee with 50 fourth-class berths. Therefore, the committee has issued a notice requesting those who have registered to verify their registration as soon as possible to facilitate ticket purchase and has scheduled to issue tickets on the morning of the 3rd. Recently, unscrupulous individuals have falsely claimed to be able to purchase ship tickets for people in order to profit from them or even swindle them. Fellow countrymen returning home should not be deceived.

### August Industrial Report: One Bleaching Factory Has Started Production; Cement Factory Nearing Completion

According to the Public Works Department, factories have been making great efforts to collect substitute raw materials during the past month. Many factories have been using scrap metal to manufacture bicycle parts and other ironware. One factory is currently planning to manufacture celluloid toothpaste tubes to replace the usual lead-tin tubes. The first bleaching powder factory in the settlements started production last month, and another is under construction. Thirty-two factories producing coffee essence have been closely monitored. Five of them were found to be using unauthorized alcohol, posing a dangerous risk, and were prosecuted. As a result, four factories were fined between 300 and 1,800 yuan each, and the manager of another factory was sentenced to one month's detention and the factory was sealed for ten days as a warning. Four new licenses for celluloid lacquer factories have been approved and issued. A total of 45 such factories have been licensed.

The Industrial and Social Affairs Department mediated eleven labor disputes, including one strike. Department officials spoke with factory managers and workers twelve times to discuss issues such as wages, dismissals, and severance pay. This work has been very helpful in preventing industrial disputes and strikes.

As of the end of August, a total of 37,137 subletting licenses for the second half of this year have been issued. 945 cases have been fined for delaying the renewal of licenses. 138 appeals regarding rental disputes have been processed. 3,865 household investigations have been conducted regarding license renewals and rent amounts. Only 1,218 of the 2,750 licensed tenants were able to adjust rents in accordance with regulations. The remainder were ordered to adjust their rents. Four cases of charging excessive rent have been referred to the courts. Ten cases of soliciting tips were processed last month, of which four have been submitted to the court for review. The defendants in two cases have been sentenced to 15 days and one day of detention, respectively. The remaining two cases are still pending trial.

### New and Old Buyers Acting Simultaneously: Public Bonds Soar

Yesterday, the market situation for unified public bonds soared, with a strongly rising trend. This was due to a better environment and a renewed sense of optimism. Consequently, many new buyers flocked in, and many existing holders aggressively increased their positions. Furthermore, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, leading to a temporary influx of buyers. The market was dominated by buying sentiment. At the opening in the morning, the trend was strong, and buying interest was quite active. Class C bonds initially rose by four cents, considered a low opening price. Subsequently, all bonds gradually opened higher, with buyers pushing prices up. However, due to excessive sharp increases, some holders were compelled to sell, resulting in a pullback of up to half a yuan. Nevertheless, the final result was a uniform increase of six to nine cents, reaching new high prices. Observing the market atmosphere, although the foundation is still solid, Class C bonds need to firmly establish themselves above one and a half yuan. Otherwise, if major holders start selling, the reaction could be significant. Overall trading was brisk, with approximately 2.3 to 2.4 million yuan in transactions. A table of initial and subsequent prices is provided below.

### Department Store Stocks Listless

Yesterday's market situation for Chinese merchant stocks was mixed, with some rising and others falling. The department store sector, however, trended downward. Rumors circulated that Wing On Company had fallen below 90 yuan, down five yuan, while Sincere also dropped four yuan. Shanghai Nei Wai Cotton Mill initially retreated slightly from 34.5 yuan to 33.5 yuan, eventually closing flat. Most other stocks rose initially before experiencing a slight pullback. New Pharmaceutical Works and New Asia continued their rally from the previous two days, once rising to 48.5 yuan, with bids as high as 49 yuan. Shortly after, they sharply retreated to 46.5 yuan, ultimately closing at the same price as the previous day. Sino-French Waterworks rose by five cents, while Min Yi Industrial Company fell by half a yuan, maintaining a stable trend. In the cultural sector, Commercial Press saw little trading at a flat price, while Chung Hwa Book Company rose by three yuan to reach the 160 yuan mark, and The World Book Company remained at one yuan, with the highest price at 115 yuan. Buying interest in Great China Match Company and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company has weakened, while the public utility stocks of Chapei Water & Electricity and China General Edison closed flat. New stocks such as Fu Chang Textile and Dyeing and Ta Chung Textile maintained a stable position. Overall sentiment is stable, and trading is quite active. A table of stock prices is provided below.

### Gold and Silver Jewelry: All Priced Lower

Yesterday, gold shops in the city, including Dah Sing and other jewelers, reduced the listed price of gold jewelry by 50 yuan per tael to 2,100 yuan (with a 300 yuan reduction for purchases). The exchange price among jewelers initially started at 1,850 yuan, then 1,840 yuan, as some syndicates absorbed it. It then rebounded by 20 yuan, totaling 1,870 yuan, and at noon, it stood at 1,855 yuan, 5 yuan higher than the previous day, with a difference of 20 yuan. Trading was slow.

As for silver jewelry, the listed price was reduced by two yuan per tael to 14 yuan. The exchange price among jewelers remained at 10 yuan and 89 cents.

### Oil Merchants Still Covering: Military Scrip Market Firm

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, the selling pressure from individual investors in Japanese military scrip weakened, while small oil merchants were still covering their positions. As a result, the exchange price among dealers rebounded to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 5 li, and 6 hao. Small money shops and bank branches bought at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and sold at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 6.5 hao, with some asking for 7 hao.

Yesterday, the interbank lending rate announced by the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 1 jiao and 2 fen. Spot cash was still being exchanged at par with new drafts.

### Coarse Grains Rise Again

Arrivals of beans remain low, and sentiment continues to be optimistic, leading to further price increases. Yesterday, 30 bags of Tianjin red beans opened at 167 yuan, and 20 bags of broad beans opened at 330 yuan. Over 20 bags of Chongming sand red beans opened at 162 yuan, all self-supplied.

Demand for dried sweet potatoes remains strong, and sellers continue to raise prices. Yesterday, over 30 bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes opened at 114.5 yuan.

Supply of wheat bran remains tight, and the market is trending upward. Yesterday, 200 small bags of Sanxin wheat bran with May warehouse receipts opened at 114.5 yuan.

According to statistics from the Oil Industry Wholesale Association, the city's consumption of cooking oil in August totaled 23,690 dan, an increase of 6,829 dan compared to the previous month.

### Cigarette Market Steady

The cigarette market remains steady, as most dealers are holding and observing, intending to profit from inactivity. Therefore, market sentiment is slowly testing the waters, making it difficult for selling prices to fall. Yesterday, prices for brands such as British American Tobacco's remained at 8,250 yuan, flat; Old Gold at 5,850 yuan; Pin Hai at 5,500 yuan; Fairy at 4,350 yuan; and Wu Hua at 4,600 yuan, all seeing increases of 50 to 100 yuan.

Overall, it is difficult for the market to decline, generally exhibiting an upward and downward, circling and struggling state.

### Early Red Branches of Inferior Quality

The number of early red branches arriving is not high, and the market price is lower than other goods. Some goods were put up for sale yesterday, but because some were slightly moldy, they could not command a high price, so the opening price was more than 10 yuan lower than last week. Market sentiment is still stable, as the drop in opening prices is due to the inferior quality of the goods.

### Tailors' Guild

Establishment of the French Concession Office

The Shanghai Special City Tailors' Guild, located on Chapoo Road in Hongkew, has 80 members in the French Concession section. Due to price restrictions and various other reasons, they requested a separate office to facilitate the handling of matters for members. Yesterday, a branch office was formally established at 37 Avenue Joffre. Representatives from the French Concession Police Department, Mr. Tien, and the president of the General Assembly, Mr. Wei Langxi, gave guiding speeches. They resolved to standardize prices, categorize labor costs, and base the sale of woolen fabrics on weight in ounces.

A representative was sent to the Woolen Fabric Guild to request that tailors purchase materials in the future strictly according to the price list with a discount for the sake of fairness. The first board of directors was also selected.

### Sugar Rationing Approved for 20,000 Bags This Month

### Electric Torch in the Forest

— Gao Jiaji

Last summer, I was once in the forest, and I realized that it was getting late, and I was still far from the campsite. I had to traverse narrow paths in complete darkness. I only had a flashlight. In modern lighting, a flashlight is a pitifully weak light source, but how necessary it was! I could hear the flashlight talking to itself: "I am a small thing, but I have my importance. I am a representative of light. The world needs many representatives of light: the sun during the day, the moon at night, the brightly lit streetlights in the city, the light in the room illuminating open books, but it also needs me. Although I am small, I can represent something eternally valuable in the world. I am a representative of light."

If something as small as a flashlight can say such things, so can you. You might say that you have no accomplishments. I don't want to argue with you about that, because you might be right. You are likely like other people, very ordinary, but since you are a person, you can represent something greater than yourself. Before you leave this world, become a representative of something permanent, beautiful, and just. The sun or a candle, a star or a match, can all emit light; they represent light.

The above two paragraphs are what the famous American pastor Dr. Fosdick said in a lecture. Yes, something as small as a firefly can become a symbol of light, let alone us humans?

In our daily lives, do we represent anything? What do we represent?

Education

### The Value of University Education

— Liu Songsheng

Is university education necessary, and what is the value of university education? These are questions that many people have raised, but no clear and practical answer has ever been obtained.

Dr. Smith, a teaching assistant in sociology at the University of Kansas in the United States, believes that whether university education is necessary and the value of university education entirely depends on the individual's goals and what career they want to pursue. Some professions can achieve great success without university education, while other professions cannot even take the first step without a university degree. "Analyzing the educational background of famous people in the United States, the following conclusions were found:

In academia, only a small number of famous people have university degrees, accounting for only 8.5% of the total.

Actors and other professionals in drama and film also do not need a university degree to become famous. Among the actors and other professionals in the American theater and drama industries, only 8.7% graduated from university. Almost half of the total only attended elementary school.

Among famous musicians, three-quarters have attended music schools, but university education does not seem necessary, as only one-fifth have obtained a university degree.

Famous writers and journalists are equally divided between university graduates and non-graduates. Among famous writers, one-seventh have never attended high school.

University education is unnecessary for actors, but it is essential for doctors. Every famous doctor in the United States has received university education. In order to succeed in modern medicine, a university degree is absolutely necessary. The proportion of famous pastors in the United States who have university degrees is also very high, accounting for as much as 96.9%.

Among famous engineers, scientists, and military leaders, about 90% have graduated from university. About 60% of famous officials graduated from university. Less than half of famous businessmen graduated from university.

Although the social situation in the United States is somewhat different from that in China, we can see a glimpse of the value of university education from this. Whether university education is necessary mainly depends on the future career. At the same time, it is certainly best to have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of university education, but it is not necessary to be discouraged if you do not have this opportunity. Because the above statistics tell us that, except for doctors, famous people who have achieved success in their respective professions have all done so without university education.

### Random Talk About Pawnshops

— Little Shopkeeper

(2) Historical Materials on Pawnshops

Around 1920, the pawnbroking industry was at its peak. At that time, the valuation of pawned items was generally 50% to 70% of their market value. Due to the cyclical rise in prices, the profits from selling foreclosed items were very high, sometimes exceeding 50% of the principal. Moreover, the number of foreclosed items was much higher than it is today (the current foreclosure rate is only 0.2% to 0.6%). Therefore, at that time, the shopkeepers were only worried about not having enough foreclosed items.

After the January 28th Incident, all industries in Shanghai fell into a recession. Pawnshops, being in the middle of a decline in goods and a sharp drop in market prices, suffered losses. Because of the longer loan terms, the value of foreclosed items at maturity, when prices were falling daily, was no longer equal to the resale market price, and the losses were even greater due to the rapid increase in the foreclosure rate. At that time, the fixed price sold to the trading houses could only recover about 50% to 70% of the cost. This went on for more than three years, and with the conversion of silver into national currency, prices rebounded, and the industry gradually recovered (actually, it was the goods that rose in value and the currency that fell).

The first three years after the August 13th Incident were a confusing period for pawnshops. Because the profits from sales were as high as 100% to 300% of the principal, the shopkeepers were extremely happy and worked hard to increase capital, believing that there would be huge profits to be made. But while the profits were high, they did not expect the rapid decline in the foreclosure rate, and at the same time, prices rose and expenses increased greatly, which shattered the shopkeepers' dreams, and they helplessly cried out in confusion. Afterwards, under the great currency reform, the currency on the account books presented to the shopkeepers changed its name and the numbers changed (the clear stipulation was that the redemption of ordinary items was equivalent to the repayment of debts at a ratio of two to one). This came as a great shock, and immediately a three-character phrase appeared: "Close, close, close!" At the same time, under the decision of the guild, interest rates were increased, and pawnshop customers were notified to pay all interest and exchange for new tickets within a ten-day deadline, after which it was proposed to redeem pawned items at a ratio of seven to seven. Because the law was important, this proposal had to be cancelled. Only the increase in interest was implemented. The authorities were well aware of the difficulties of the pawnshop industry and were very understanding of the interest rate increase. Given that banks and money shops were increasing interest rates to prevent hoarding, the current measures taken by the pawnshop industry should also be reasonable. Otherwise, the pawnshop industry would not be able to sustain itself, and the poor would have no access to loans and would have to sell their only clothes and old goods to secondhand dealers. In this time of difficult living, where would they get the money to make new clothes? This is a not-so-small and rather serious problem. Before a public pawnshop is established, prevention should be taken.

### Riding the Storm Together

— He Jiaqi

(8) What Can Be Done?

Wei Yunqing slammed the abacus on the table several times. Two or three people walked in from outside, two were long-term workers, and one was an old nanny. They ate Wei Yunqing's food and took Wei Yunqing's money. Walking into the house, they only saw Wei Yunqing and no one else. Wei Yunqing pointed and said: "What are you people doing? Someone comes in, and you don't know how to stop them. Now, I want you to drive them out! I have lived for all these years, going up to the county government and down to Zhang A'san's and Li A'si's house, and I have never seen such a woman. Drive her out, drive her out!" Madam Ye Er listened to Wei Yunqing being so unreasonable and was about to argue with him, but Magpie panicked and pulled at Madam Ye Er's sleeve, saying, "Madam, let's go and tell the young master." Madam Ye Er just sneered a few times and said: "Rich man, so this is what you're like, I understand." She nodded, letting Magpie help her out. The long-term workers and nannies saw Madam Ye Er's dress and knew that she was a madam from a wealthy family, so they didn't dare to be rude; only after Madam Ye Er voluntarily walked out did they put on a show, raising their hands and pretending to carry out the order to drive her out. Magpie said: "We are from Houhe, where do we go now?" The old nanny left Wei Yunqing's side and did a good deed, saying: "You come with me."

Wei Yunqing was still smashing the abacus in the room. With the last smash, he quickly picked up the abacus to look at it, but a copper pin that wrapped around one corner of the abacus had fallen off, and the copper was also damaged. He felt extremely pained and muttered to himself: "Shameless woman, shortchanged my money, coming to my door without apologizing, but asking who is in your house, who is in your house? You are not the great master sitting facing south, you deserve to come and ask me, outrageous." He stood up, put his hands behind his back, and walked around the room like a millstone, calling out. "Who's outside? A long-term worker walked in and said: "It's me." Wei Yunqing said: "Did the Ye family's woman leave?" The long-term worker said: "They said they were from Houhe and went towards the back." Wei Yunqing said, "Go find Fei Changhe." The long-term worker said, "Fei Changhe is in the gambling den." Wei Yunqing said, "If he is in the gambling den, can't you go and find him? You rice bucket, you bastard!" (171)
