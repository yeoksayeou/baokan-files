### British Main Force Warships Heading East: Indian Ocean May Become Battlefield; Ceylon May Be Attacked; No New Developments on Burmese Front Yesterday

Tokyo, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese Navy spokesman Hirai declared in the January issue of "Japanese Frontline News" that Ceylon is no longer a safe haven for British fleets, and the British fleets have been forced to retreat to Mumbai. According to recent intelligence, in order to protect British power east of Suez, the British government continues to send two battleships and two aircraft carriers to India, attempting a final struggle. Now, the remnants of the British, American, and Dutch navies in Darwin Harbor are not worth paying attention to. The US Pacific Fleet has suffered heavy losses, and it will take at least three or four years to restore it to its pre-war state. Although President Roosevelt has a massive air and naval plan, its realization is slim under the Japanese blockade. Today, Japan has become the master of the Pacific, and one day the Indian Ocean and the Pacific will both become the Japanese Sea.

London, 12th (Reuters) – Authorities here declared yesterday that after repeated setbacks in the Far East, the Indian Ocean is now wide open. It is expected that Japan will attack Allied trade and transportation in the Indian Ocean. Japanese activities may extend as far as Ceylon in India, or focus on an offensive against Darwin Harbor in Australia.

New Delhi, 11th (Reuters) – The Army Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that there has been no new news from the central front since yesterday. The communiqué also mentioned yesterday evening's communiqué, which stated that the civil authorities in the Irrawaddy Delta had evacuated due to the presence of Japanese troops in the area. This was done before the Japanese landed. According to a statement issued by the civil defense authorities, a certain city in Myanmar reported Japanese aerial activity, but there were no air raids in other areas, and no important news was reported. A communiqué from the British Royal Air Force Command in Myanmar stated that British bombers attacked Moulmein the night before.

Tōjō Warns Australia and India

Tokyo, 12th (Dōmei News Agency) – Prime Minister Tōjō delivered a speech in parliament this morning, warning Australia and India to change their attitudes to avoid being misled by Britain and the United States. He said, in essence, "Australia must understand that it has no ability to defend itself against the ever-victorious Japanese army. If it does not change its current attitude, it will inevitably follow the example of the Dutch East Indies. It is hoped that it can decide its attitude at this extremely important juncture. India has been occupied by Britain for a long time, and Britain is now thinking of using various tricks to deceive India. If Indian leaders disregard the long-standing wishes of the Indian people, abandon the God-given opportunity, and still willingly be fooled by Britain, then it is believed that India will never have a chance to save itself. The misfortune of India's 400 million people will be the greatest." Prime Minister Tōjō also said that Japan is determined to intensify its operations until it defeats Britain and the United States and establishes a new order in East Asia. In addition, Prime Minister Tōjō also described the progress of the war in great detail.

Admiral Hart Discusses Allied Navy

Washington, 11th (United Press) – Admiral Hart, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, who recently returned home, said that the Japanese army's achievements in the Far East were due to the superiority of its air force. The Allied naval strength in the Far East is very weak, but it fights extremely well. Since the sinking of the British battleship Repulse and the Prince of Wales, half of the Allied fleet in the Far East is made up of American warships. The Repulse and the Prince of Wales were the only two battleships the Allies had in the Pacific, so their loss was extremely serious. The Allies' plan will be overturned by the loss of this base, as Japan can use its superior air force to destroy the facilities of most of the Allied naval bases. In the first two months, the Allies used ten convoys to transport troops and supplies to Singapore. Some Dutch warships and a few American warships were also used for escort purposes. When asked whether the Allies would launch a formal offensive to recover lost territory or carry out a flank attack, Hart replied that a frontal attack is always difficult, while a flank attack is always easier to implement.

### British Army Studies Japanese Military Tactics and Eastern Front Combat Experience

London, 11th (Reuters) – During a debate in the House of Commons, Duncan, the financial secretary of the War Office, stated that the army has studied the Japanese army's infiltration tactics in the Far East and the experience of Soviet guerrillas in combat on the Eastern Front. This experience will be applied in appropriate circumstances.

### Melbourne Suffers First Air Raid Yesterday; Japanese Army Announces Landing in New Guinea; Port Moresby Continues to Be Bombed Yesterday

Tokyo, 12th (Dōmei News Agency) – According to Australian radio broadcasts received tonight, Japanese bombers attacked the southern Australian city of Melbourne for thirty-five minutes this morning, the first time since the start of the Pacific War. However, the details of the Japanese surprise attack have not been announced. Melbourne is located about 2,000 miles southeast of Darwin Harbor, which is often bombed on the north coast of Australia.

Tokyo, 12th (Dōmei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:10 p.m. today that Japanese army and navy units landed in Salamaua and Lae on the northern coast of British New Guinea on the 8th of this month. On the 10th of this month, 60 enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese-occupied areas in that area and were shot down four. They were repelled. When the Japanese army landed, three requisitioned ships and one transport ship were sunk or grounded, and one cruiser, two destroyers, and three requisitioned ships were slightly damaged.

Canberra, 12th (Reuters) – An Australian communiqué today stated that Australian Air Force reconnaissance planes were attacked by Japanese fighters over the Salamaua and Lae areas of New Guinea. At noon on Wednesday, Port Moresby was attacked by a squadron of Japanese bombers, which were attacked by Australian anti-aircraft artillery.

### President Roosevelt's Message to Congress States That the Current Situation is Serious

Washington, 11th (Havas News Agency) – President Roosevelt sent a message to the House and Senate today, stating that the current situation is quite serious. At this point, transportation between the United States, Britain, and other Allied countries is very difficult. The difficulty of transporting a tank to the Soviet Union is ten times greater than the difficulty of manufacturing it. This is undeniable. Therefore, we must do everything we can to increase the tonnage of merchant ships currently used by the Allies.

### Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook Cautions Australian Authorities; Discusses Java Campaign in Melbourne Yesterday

Saigon, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here, Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook declared in Melbourne yesterday that Australia must prepare for the worst. Australian troops must be concentrated under unified command and must pay attention to attacking the Japanese army's supply lines. However, the number of Allied reinforcements that arrived in Java was very small, and the air force consisted of only a few British and American fighters and Flying Fortresses. The Dutch East Indies navy and air force suffered heavy losses in Malaya, Borneo, and elsewhere, so they could not prevent the Japanese from landing. The lack of adequate training of the troops resulted in great losses of soldiers and materiel. Britain and the United States probably underestimated the seriousness of the situation, which led to ineffective assistance to the Dutch East Indies.

Melbourne, 11th (Havas News Agency) – Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook, accompanied by his colleagues, fled here from Java. He will soon travel to Washington via London to take up a position in the Dutch central government in London. According to Van Mook's account to reporters about the Java campaign, the number of Japanese troops who landed was greater than expected, and the landing points covered the entire coast. As for the defense forces, a small part of the reinforcements hoped for from the Allied countries did arrive. These troops were originally prepared to go to Singapore, but were temporarily reassigned to the Dutch East Indies. However, most of them were not fully equipped. We transferred most of these troops to the front lines to assist in the fighting. The US Asiatic Fleet, based in Manila, also came to help. A few British warships also came to help. In terms of air force, there was initially a weak air force, including British and American fighter squadrons and some Flying Fortresses. Afterwards, except for a few fighters, no other aircraft arrived. All the troops that arrived in time fought bravely. However, when reinforcements did not follow, we knew that there would be no more help from now on. When the Japanese army landed in Java, the Dutch fleet and air force had actually lost their fighting power, because our navy and air force were unusable after participating in the battles of Malaya, Borneo, and the Makassar Strait. Furthermore, the Dutch East Indies' national defense plan was not completed at all before the outbreak of this war, especially the air force. The government had ordered more materials than usual, and although there were enough air force personnel, not all of them were fully trained. I have witnessed the inevitable consequences of a lack of training: In short, both soldiers and materials suffered losses. I would like to offer two pieces of advice to the Australian authorities: First, concentrate all wartime organizations to avoid the lack of coordination caused by the separation of command posts. Second, do not fight with inadequately trained troops, because proper training is of great significance. Aerial bombardment does not have a serious impact on the morale of well-trained troops. Japanese aircraft are better than "Wirraways" and "Brewsters," but not as good as "Hurricanes" and the best American fighters. However, Japanese pilots are quite excellent. In short, Australia must prepare for the worst situation. Although the Soviet Union can provide assistance due to its geographical location, it is busy with events in Europe and has no time to take care of other matters.

Canberra, 11th (Reuters) – Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook has flown from Melbourne to Canberra. Mook met with Dutch officials in Melbourne on the 7th to discuss the re-establishment of Dutch military power. According to Tan Wanlong, although he surrendered to the Japanese army to protect the safety of civilians, the government has ordered the troops on the front lines to continue fighting. I believe that the three armies will be able to operate. Central Sumatra is still in the hands of the Dutch army. Most of the Dutch naval personnel have escaped from Java, and a large number of air force personnel and trainees have also escaped.

### US Sends Respects on Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Death

Washington, 11th (United Press) – US Army Chief of Staff Marshall sent a telegram to the highest authorities in Chongqing on the 17th anniversary of the death of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, saying, "Today is the anniversary of the death of your country's first president. On this day, I would like to send a telegram to Your Excellency. Our two peoples, the United States and China, have always expressed admiration and sympathy for the achievements of Your Excellency in promoting democracy and your country's national defense over the years. Today, our military ties have made us even closer in the political sphere."

### US Troops Continue to Arrive in Two Dutch West Indies Islands

Buenos Aires, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – US troops continue to be transported to Curaçao in the Dutch West Indies. Judging from the measures taken by the US military on the island, it can be seen that the island will be converted into a military base.

Curaçao (Dutch West Indies), 12th (Reuters) – US troops are now steadily arriving in Curaçao and Aruba in the Dutch West Indies, but details cannot be disclosed.

### Portugal Carries Out Civil Air Defense

Lisbon, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – Portuguese newspapers published new laws organizing civil air defense in wartime. The new laws formulated this time are about strategies for dealing with aircraft attacks on highways, art treasures, and important business centers, as well as measures to resist enemy paratroopers, and even measures to prevent sabotage. They are all carefully planned. They also mention how to protect the public and public property, and how to repair the damage after an air raid. All Portuguese citizens, regardless of age or gender, must be prepared to participate in the organization of civil air defense.

### Repair Work in Suburbs of Paris; Thousands of Workers Are Underway

Paris, 11th (Havas News Agency) – The suburbs of Paris were bombed by British aircraft on the 3rd of this month, causing heavy losses. Various repair works are now underway. More than 2,000 workers are clearing ash and repairing houses, and are reinstalling water pipes and power lines in certain places. 75% has already been repaired. The National Relief Committee has allocated funds to relieve refugees, providing 1,000 winter clothes and 20,000 meals, free of charge. The city of Algiers took the lead in accommodating refugee children, and several cities followed suit. The Seine and Oise provinces are willing to accommodate 200 refugee children.

It is widely believed that Russia will become the northern wing of the anti-Japanese defense line this year, and Australia will become the southern wing of the anti-Japanese defense line.

### French Ambassador Reassures Again That Fleet Will Not Be Handed Over; Heydrich Visits Welles to Protest Anti-French Propaganda in American Newspapers and Declares to Protect Madagascar

Washington, 12th (Havas News Agency) – French Ambassador to the United States Heydrich visited Under Secretary of State Welles today to protest against the anti-French propaganda conducted by American newspapers and radio stations, saying that the US government's condoning of this propaganda will inevitably make relations between France and the United States more complicated. When the ambassador left the State Department, a reporter asked, "The Soviet side is rumored to have said that when Germany and France signed an armistice, France was building 40 warships and has now handed them over to Germany. Is this true?" The ambassador replied that the French fleet is entirely in the hands of the French and will be so in the future. When asked about the rumor that the French-owned African island of Madagascar would become a Japanese base, the ambassador also said that he had not heard that the Japanese government had made such a request, and that France would protect its colonies, especially Madagascar.

Washington, 12th (Reuters) – French Ambassador Heydrich reassured US Under Secretary of State Welles yesterday that the French fleet would not be handed over to the Axis powers. Afterwards, Heydrich told reporters that Madagascar belongs to France now and will be so in the future. It will never be handed over to any party. Subsequently, British Ambassador Halifax also visited Welles, but the purpose of this visit was not disclosed.

London, 12th (Reuters) – London sources stated last night that at present, there is no sign that the Germans intend to take over the French fleet. There have been rumors about the future of the French fleet for a long time, but Admiral Darlan is quite proud of the French fleet he created, and it is questionable whether he would allow this fleet to fall into German hands. The French ship Dunkirk, which was damaged in Oran and subsequently transferred to Toulon, may not be suitable for action for many months to come. Many French ships have been anchored in Toulon for a long time. However, as far as is known, the Richelieu is now moored in Dakar, and its sister ship, the Jean Bart, has not yet been completed, and has been transferred to Casablanca. Its construction work may not be proceeding, because Casablanca does not have the facilities for the large-scale projects required by the ship.

### Pétain and Darlan Inspect French Warships

Berlin, 12th (Reuters) – A dispatch from Vichy states that French Premier Pétain and Deputy Premier Darlan recently inspected the French warship Dunkirk in Toulon.

### South Africa Does Not Feel Threatened and Will Not Occupy French Territory

Cape Town, 11th (Reuters) – South African Prime Minister General Smuts reported to Parliament today that if we do not feel threatened, we have no intention of occupying Madagascar. Smuts also believes that Madagascar and Mozambique (Portuguese) are the outer defense points of South Africa.

### Lyon Supreme Court Continues to Try Blum

Lyon, 11th (Havas News Agency) – The Lyon Supreme Court today continued to try former Premier Blum. Justice Gao asked the reasons for nationalizing the ordnance factories. Blum replied that the French people mostly believed that the ordnance production during the last war was very successful, so they mostly advocated nationalization, with only the Communist Party opposing it. For example, the Schneider armory received an order from the Soviet Union, stating that the factory did not want to be nationalized. The Soviet Ambassador Bodankin even personally approached me to negotiate. Justice Gao also asked about the 40-hour work week issue. He replied that the 40-hour work week and leisure organizations had a positive impact on military production. As for me, during my tenure, I always advocated a non-armed peaceful policy. This has been advocated by successive cabinets after the war and has also been supported by the canine part of the country. As for the disarmament policy of the Socialist Party, it has never advocated immediate, complete, or unilateral disarmament. Because my country continues to work for peace, its international status has been greatly improved. The country that prepares for peace but does not wage war has close ties with other countries, and international support for my country is growing. At this point, I do not have a war crime. I believe that over the years I have been regarded as a pacifist and have spared no effort to maintain peace. Even although I am a Jew and a Marxist, I still received Hitler's representative Schacht, whose motivation was to ensure peace.

### International Briefs

Vatican City, 11th (Havas News Agency) – The Pope's health has recovered, and he received guests today. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the Pope's accession to the throne, and a celebration ceremony will be held. The Pope plans to attend in person.

Paris, 11th (Havas News Agency) – After the death of Duke Aosta, the former Italian Governor of Abyssinia, the authorities held a memorial mass at the Clotilde Church here today, presided over by Bishop Schapter, representing the Archbishop of Paris, Suhard.

### Australia Is Mobilizing

Australia's manpower and material resources are in large-scale mobilization. Recently, it has abandoned its defensive "scorched earth policy" and has changed to an offensive doctrine. From now on, it will no longer talk about retreat. It is expected that in the near future, a fierce war will unfold in the South Pacific. The Japanese army has continued to land in New Guinea for days, and Australia is suffering more and more. (Top picture) Australian women, whether old, young, beautiful, or ugly, have been mobilized, and nurses have gone to serve on the front lines. (Bottom picture) A monument erected after the end of the last European War, with the Kipling quote "Lest We Forget," which can be translated as "Never Forget."

### Churchill Announces in the House of Commons Permission for India to Implement Constitutional Governance, with Cripps Negotiating Secondary Issues to Be Resolved As Well

London, 11th (Havas) - Prime Minister Churchill today made an important statement in the House of Commons regarding the Indian question. The Prime Minister stated that no decision would be made regarding the legal status India should hold until a thorough investigation of the situation in that country was conducted. Therefore, Sir Stafford Cripps will be responsible for conducting the investigation to facilitate this. "Since the Japanese army advanced southward, India has faced a crisis. Therefore, the British government sincerely hopes that India will concentrate all its efforts so that it can resolutely resist any future attacks. This expectation has been increasing day by day. As for our country's policy towards India and its objectives, the government issued a statement in August 1940, and offered a promise to grant India dominion status, equal to that of other dominions of the British Empire, as soon as the war ends. In addition, we will allow the drafting of a constitution for the Indian people in the future. The drafting of this constitution must not only take into account the lives of the Indian people but also obtain the full consent of the Indian people, so that any provision of this constitution can be accepted by the Indian people. At the same time, we still have the obligation to protect the various ethnic minorities and lower classes in India, which goes without saying. However, since we are closely related to India, we should find ways to resolve certain secondary issues. In recent weeks, various parties have been arguing endlessly about the Indian question, and no consensus has been reached. In order to avoid this unnecessary debate, we have decided to take various measures to avoid the following situations. In other words: 1. Do not allow a powerful minority group in India to oppose the reform plan for a long period of time without end. 2. Do not allow the measures taken by the majority ethnic group to encounter opposition from the minority ethnic groups. Therefore, we originally intended to take immediate steps to make a constructive contribution to the establishment of an autonomous government in India. However, we are deeply afraid that this step will be too hasty and will do more harm than good. Therefore, the urgent task is to obtain the full support of all parties in India and to obtain guarantees that they will put all their strength at our disposal to protect our common interests. To this end, we have sent a member of the wartime cabinet to India to discuss everything with key Indian figures. I believe that this solution is fair. Sir Stafford Cripps volunteered to go to India. He will try to obtain the support of the majority ethnic groups in India and attempt to seek the support of certain powerful minority ethnic groups (mainly Muslims). At that time, Sir Stafford Cripps will meet with the Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army and firmly express to all parties that our government is determined to fulfill all its obligations to protect India from the threat of the current crisis. In short, Sir Stafford Cripps will go to India in the near future. The House of Commons does not need to debate this matter before he returns to report, as this would only make the trip unsuccessful. During his absence, the position of the government representative in the House of Commons will be temporarily held by Foreign Secretary Eden."

Political Parties Agree on Measures to Handle India

London, 11th (Reuters) - Prime Minister Churchill read a statement in the House of Commons today stating that the government has decided to send Lord Privy Seal Cripps to India and grant him full power to carry out his mission, namely to present to India the conclusion unanimously reached by the wartime cabinet regarding the constitutional status of India. The Prime Minister's statement lasted seven minutes and was delivered in a very slow manner. The history of India's constitution has thus opened a new page. The House of Commons and the House of Lords had originally scheduled to debate the Indian situation this week, but were temporarily canceled at the request of the Prime Minister. There is little doubt that Cripps will gain the trust and support of all parties during this trip to India. The Prime Minister's statement was agreed to by all members. All parties praised the Prime Minister for dealing with this complex situation with the demeanor of a statesman. How important the issues that will be considered in the future and the solution to this issue (referring to sending an envoy to India) are, has not been deliberately ignored by all parties. This solution can be considered unanimously agreed upon by all major political parties, as the Conservative Party has also welcomed Cripps to India in the same way as other political parties.

London, 10th (Reuters) - London's evening newspapers unanimously published the news of the government's decision to send Lord Privy Seal Cripps as an envoy to India in a prominent position. The Standard Evening News stated that Cripps's mission is to make Indian leaders believe that the British people sincerely hope that India will transition to unity and freedom. This task is extremely difficult. Cripps is often a candidate who is willing to take on the task. He has many close personal relationships with Indian leaders. Britain and the free world all hope that he will achieve something in this difficult task.

Indian Representative to the United States Bajpai Makes a Statement

Washington, 11th (Reuters) - Indian Representative to the United States Bajpai, after talking with the US President at the White House, told reporters that he was satisfied with Cripps's visit to India. It is said that Cripps's policy toward India has always been known for its liberalism. When Cripps visited India two years ago, he had many meetings with Indian leaders. That visit to India was almost a prelude to the success of this trip. Bajpai also said that his visit to Roosevelt today was unrelated to the British announcement of Cripps's visit to India. US Undersecretary of State Welles introduced him to the President, and Welles also participated in discussions on sending a US delegation to India. Bajpai said that he hoped that the delegation would achieve complete success in the war efforts in India's production. The British Ministry of Supply had previously sent the Rogers delegation to India and submitted a report to the British government last summer. The delegation achieved excellent results. India's welcome to the US delegation can show India's eagerness to cooperate with the United States and its desire to learn what assistance the United States can provide to India.

London, 10th - According to reliable Indian sources, they believe that the biggest obstacle in the negotiations is the question of whether to allow the Indian Executive Council to be responsible to the Governor-General, in other words, to the British government. Although there is constant hostility between the National Congress and the Muslim League, the leaders of both parties are believed to be willing to work to promote the Indianization of the Executive Council, but only on the condition that the issue of to whom it is responsible must be resolved.

German External Sources Comment on British-Indian Relations

Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - A German Foreign Ministry official declared that whether the Indian people will continue to trust Britain's promises or trust the warnings of Indian leader Bose regarding Lord Privy Seal Cripps's visit to India is currently unknown. The British official stated that Cripps's visit was to inspect the ethnic minorities in India and not for the benefit of Britain. However, Britain often uses internal disputes in India, and it is likely to continue to adopt this strategy.

Berlin, 12th (Havas) - The newspapers here have commented on British Prime Minister Churchill's announcement in the House of Commons that Lord Privy Seal Cripps will visit India, saying that Britain wants to deceive the Indian people again. The People's Observer stated that at this critical moment of survival, Britain has become anxious about everything. There is no doubt that Churchill will make greater concessions to India than before. However, Churchill's declaration this time is actually his usual trick of being conceited and overestimating himself. The German Daily reported that Britain is anxious about its Indian colonies.

Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry pointed out that the British government has no real desire to solve the Indian problem. In 1929, Churchill said that granting India dominion status was an unimaginable thing. In a speech in 1930, he stated that Britain would never be prepared to give up India. This time, Churchill sent Cripps to India to have Cripps deal with unsolvable difficult problems, not with the sincerity to solve the Indian problem.

### Soviet Troops in the Donets Region Launch Fierce Attacks; Fighting Continues in Several Locations; German Infantry Also Launches Multiple Counterattacks

German Leader's Headquarters, 12th (Haitong News Agency)

### German Giant Battleship Sails from Northern Norway; British Aircraft Attempted to Attack

London, 12th (Reuters) - The Admiralty announced last night that, according to reconnaissance aircraft reports, the German battleship Tirpitz had departed from the port of Trondheim, Norway, and sailed north along the Norwegian coast. By the morning of the 9th of this month, the ship had been discovered. British naval aircraft immediately dropped several torpedoes on it. The results are unknown. The ship was only seen retreating towards the Norwegian coast under the cover of thick smoke. Four British aircraft did not return. In addition, the British fleet was unable to engage it. The Tirpitz is of the same class as the Bismarck, nominally 35,000 tons, but in reality, it has particularly thick armor, or between 40,000 and 45,000 tons. It is equipped with eight 15-inch guns, which are extremely powerful, twelve 5.9-inch anti-aircraft guns, sixteen 4.1-inch anti-aircraft guns, and four aircraft.

According to a Reuters correspondent in the Western Desert, the front lines of the two armies in the Western Desert remain the same as three weeks ago. The German army seems to be deploying positions between Derna and Mechili, and strengthening the strength of armored units. German and Italian tanks infiltrated British positions in some areas. In addition, there is only patrol and air activity in the vanguard area. Armored patrols from both sides are active in enemy territory. Currently, British and German forces are contending for air superiority. Tobruk is a frequent target of German aircraft attacks.

Rome, 11th (Havas) - The General Command recently issued a war report stating that enemy reconnaissance teams in the Mechili region of the Libyan front launched multiple attacks, but were repelled by Axis forces. The enemy suffered heavy losses. British mechanized units were bombed by our air force, and a large number of vehicles were damaged. British aircraft have once again bombed the port of Benghazi. Our aircraft continued to bomb the British island of Malta today. One airfield and several warehouses were hit. Personnel on board saw many large fires breaking out on the ground. A total of eleven enemy aircraft were lost in one day, six of which were destroyed at the airfield, and the remaining five were shot down by German fighters.

### The Mystery of the Reincarnation of "Indian Spirit"

Britain has been managing India since 1798, for over a century. Yet, to this day, along the coastline, there are only six ports of various sizes where ships can dock. Among these six ports, only Mumbai is a good port, followed by Kolkata. Others like Karachi, Madras, etc. are just for show.

Judging from this, is India an impregnable fortress, impossible to invade? That is not the case. Indians have always been a bit too disappointing. If we were to open the Indian ledger and take a look, from the beginning of time to the present day, India has been invaded in this way, both large and small, over a dozen times.

The first time, some historians say, was around 2500 BC. When our country was still in the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, India was occupied by a group of unadulterated dark-skinned people, people from Java, who are now the "lowly caste" in India. These dark-skinned people, some say were Egyptians, some say were "Africans," but the era is too far away, and there are no battle records, so there is no way to verify it.

The second time, it was the Aryans from the west. They were a group of nomadic tribes, originally from 1500 BC. They had no nationality, but were inherently fierce and warlike. This group of nomadic people entered India from countries such as Afghanistan and Persia. When they met the Indians, of Amitabha, they were naturally impolite, first putting on a show of force, and then burning and killing, and subdued the owner, the Indian. However, these Aryans were not easy to deal with. After occupying India, they knew that the natives were not easy to deal with, so they came up with a three-chapter law. The first chapter was to announce that they would not intermarry with the Javanese "Africans." Second, they united with the higher-class natives and divided the national people into four classes: priests and literati, soldiers and generals, merchants and traders, and maids and older sisters, rickshaw pullers, etc. Also, everyone had to believe in Hinduism, but each class could not intermarry with each other.

This class system was very harmful. Because after this separation, all the Indians were not at peace all day long. Because after the class division, the Javanese were thrown into the animal path, not to mention them, and the four classes of people were also destined for their fate, unable to turn over. For example, the little Indians of rickshaw pullers and waiters had a brand new rickshaw prepared for them in their mother's womb, and they would have to take office as soon as they grew up. All people in this world are given equal human rights by God, why should rickshaw pullers and waiters pull rickshaws for generations? This is certainly extremely unequal. Since it is not equal, how can there be peace? After about two thousand years, Shakyamuni was born in Nepal, also a prince of Aryan descent. He felt that this class system was too unreasonable, so he advocated the theory of reincarnation. If sentient beings believe in the Way, they will be freed from reincarnation. In other words, as long as they convert to my Buddha Tathagata, they can be treated equally. For this matter, King Ashoka, this generation of enlightened ruler, spent a lot of effort trying to promote Buddhism to overthrow Hinduism and its various orders, but he still could not defeat the deep-rooted nature of Hinduism, and the Javanese remained lowly to the end, unable to be freed. About five hundred years later, Buddhism gradually disappeared in India. From this, we can see the harm of the Aryans.

The third invasion occurred in 326 BC, and the invader was the powerful Alexander the Great. He himself died within three or four years, leaving his descendants to play in India for a full eight Jiazi. After four hundred years, around 750 AD, Islam also took a fancy to this piece of land in India, and under the pretext of evangelism, launched a large-scale immigration-style invasion. From then on, there were three hundred years of turmoil and struggle before the foundation of Islam was laid in India, until today.

But no sooner had the Muslims settled down than Afghanistan came to conquer fifteen times in twenty-eight years, and in 1027 AD, they also became kings of India. They also occupied it for five centuries. However, two hundred years later, around 1219 AD, Yuan Emperor Genghis Khan also led a large army, entered from the northeast corner of India, and fought a battle with the Afghan king on a plateau in India. The onlookers were the general Indians. Although they inevitably suffered some collateral damage, fortunately, India had plenty of people, and it was not worth anything to die a few of them. This lively event lasted until 1526 AD, when Afghanistan gradually couldn't resist and ended. By 1806, the power of the Mongols had become exhausted, and the direct descendants of the Aryans took advantage of this opportunity, based on the mountains on the western side, and wanted to show off their skills. Unfortunately, the times were not good, and at this time, the potential of the British had been cultivated into a climate within two hundred years (1600-1800), so they rose up greatly. This time, it not only poured a bucket of cold water on the Indians' revival of the country, but also sighed at their bad fate.

However, it was not a one-step process for Britain to dominate India. It took a lot of effort, spying for many years, and going through several twists and turns to achieve their wish. Originally, the first Europeans to arrive in India were the Portuguese, before 1498. One hundred years later, the Dutch, Danes, French, and British came one after another. It seemed that the British came later and surpassed the others, but there was also one of the biggest reasons. Where does the reason lie? It turned out that in 1662, King Charles II of England and the Portuguese princess had a marriage made in heaven. This princess was also generous, and gave the port of Mumbai in India as a dowry to Charles. Charles was especially generous, and in 1668, he gave this bit of dowry to the London East India Company, taking only ten pounds of subsidy per year. The Indian business established an unshakable foundation. Naturally, business prospered from this. At that time, the thorn in the eyes of the British was France. So, in 1744, they found an excuse and had a big fight with the French in India. After seven years, they finally defeated the French. The French had no choice but to make a living under the British, barely supporting themselves for a hundred years. It was not until 1761 that the British East India Company was officially established. In the same year, Afghanistan launched another conquest, which also gave the British a lot of trouble, but they were finally driven out of the country. With great difficulty, in 1857, the British had two-thirds of the Indian territory, and Victoria officially annexed the Indian territory and served as queen. At that time, it was after the Indians' last desperate struggle. (To be continued)

### After the National Society Embargo, Rice Prices Suddenly Surge; Citizens Vie to Purchase at High Prices; Today, Rice Shops Universally Sell Corn Flour

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council announced on the 14th that it would prohibit the import of national rice into the concessions, news spread yesterday that villagers selling rice from the Chinese areas into the concessions have gradually decreased their entry. Simultaneously, those selling within the concessions are treating rice as a scarce commodity, raising prices steeply. Buyers are also competing to stockpile, willing to pay high prices, causing the price of each "dou" (a unit of volume) to soar to 45, 46, or even 50 yuan. In reality, the Rice and Grain Office is still continuing to designate warehouses to supply rice shops with foreign rice for retail sales yesterday to meet demand.

Both Concessions Take the Same Steps

According to announcements from responsible parties within the Shanghai Municipal Council, starting from the 14th of this month, the import of national rice into the International Settlement will be prohibited. The French Municipal Council is also taking the same steps as the Shanghai Municipal Council, restricting the transport of national rice within the French Concession to one "sheng" (another unit of volume). The above regulations will all be implemented from the 14th onwards. The French authorities will formally announce the above notice today.

Regulations for Transporting Rice

After the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council stipulated the fee payment and deposit methods for rice transportation permits, they issued another notice yesterday stating, "The permit fee for transporting rice or corn flour is one yuan per bag for those transported by handcart" and three yuan per bag for those transported by truck. For distances within three miles, truck transport is strictly prohibited. A separate window has been set up at the Rice and Grain Office's collection point to handle the collection of rice transport permit fees.

Rice Shops Universally Sell Corn Flour Today

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that it would begin selling corn flour for the first time this Friday (today), all 395 rice shops in both concessions are selling it. This corn flour has been processed and crushed by the Reiss & Co. trading house, with each grain ground into five or six pieces, equal in size to foreign rice. Each person is limited to purchasing one and a half "sheng," costing one yuan and seven jiao in national currency. After the first sale today, it will be sold once every Friday thereafter.

Three Warehouses to Release Rice for Retail Sales Tomorrow

The Rice and Grain Office continued to designate three warehouses yesterday: Jin Yuan No. 2 Warehouse at 129 Wenchixi Road, Ding He at 57 Lane 5, San Tai Road, and He Ji at 41 Lane 8, North Suzhou Road. It is determined that rice can be released today to supply rice shops for retail sales tomorrow. As for the method for retail sales of foreign rice and corn flour next week, foreign rice will be sold on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, and corn flour will be sold on Fridays, the same as this week.

### Dispersing Refugees from Three Shelters by a Deadline

The refugee dispersal issue, needing 700,000 in dispersal fees, is being actively pursued by the Refugee Association, the Tzu Lien Hui, and the Refugee Branch, hoping to complete it all within a week after the 15th of this month. Details are as follows:

Remaining Number of Refugees in Three Shelters: Apart from the First Refugee Shelter on Xinzha Road, directly managed by the Refugee Association, which houses 4,000 refugees, the Tzu Yuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road, managed by the Charitable Federation, houses over 4,000 refugees. Additionally, there is a shelter established by the Tzu Lien Branch, housing an undetermined number of refugees, for a total of approximately 10,000 people. All are planned and provided for by the Refugee Association.

Actively Raising Dispersal Funds

Since refugees in all shelters are limited to being fully dispersed by the 15th of this month, the Refugee Association is not only carrying out dispersal procedures but also raising dispersal funds through various means. According to estimates, the total dispersal fee for the three refugee shelters amounts to over 400,000 yuan. The dismissal fees for the three association staff and other closure matters require 300,000 yuan. Charity leaders are expending great effort in this endeavor.

Dispersal to be Completed by Mid-Month

As of yesterday, the total number of refugees dispersed from the shelters has reached between two and three thousand. The remainder will be fully dispersed within the week after the 15th. The Refugee Association also plans to stop providing supplies to all refugee shelters starting from the 16th of this month. Therefore, the refugee problem, which began at the start of the Shanghai Battle and has lasted for four years, will come to an end.

### Coal Shops Fined for Exceeding Price Limits

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that the Xin Ya Coal Shop at 252 Liaoyang Road was found to be selling coal balls for 450 yuan per ton, exceeding the Council's limit of 375 yuan. The Price Limit Enforcement Committee decided on the 11th of this month to order the shop to suspend business for four days or pay a fine of 200 yuan. Similarly, the De Lai Coal Shop at 404 Dalianwan Road and the Fang Feilong Coal Shop at 408 on the same road were punished for exceeding price limits on coal ball sales. Furthermore, the Tai He Coal Shop at 542 Wanjanshi Road was selling Hongji coal for 1,000 yuan per ton, exceeding the limit by 400 yuan. The Yuan Sen Coal Shop at 84 Yuanchang Road was selling Hongji coal for 800 yuan per ton. They were ordered to suspend business for five and six days, respectively, or pay fines of 300 yuan and 500 yuan, respectively. In addition, seven smaller coal shops were ordered to suspend business for three days or pay fines of 50 yuan each for exceeding sales limits. The Committee will impose severe penalties on any coal merchants found to violate price limit regulations as a warning.

### Commodity Prices

The following table lists the average retail prices of commodities for Wednesday, March 11th. This price list is compiled by the Industrial and Social Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council for employers to adjust employee allowances.

### Coal Balls Will Be Sold Universally; Citizens Strictly Prohibited from Stockpiling in Large Quantities

Since the production of various machine-made coal ball factories has decreased, leading to fears of shortages, the trend has become quite serious, and residents throughout the city are deeply concerned. The Coal Control Committee of both concessions, in order to prevent fuel shortages and facilitate residents' purchase of coal balls needed for daily cooking, has dispatched personnel to various factories to investigate coal reserves and the reasons for reduced production. The investigations have now been completed one after another, and the investigation personnel have reported for verification. It is learned that the Coal Control Committee of both concessions has been actively discussing concrete measures to alleviate fuel shortages in recent days and has made progress. Therefore, the supply of fuel coal balls in the city is expected to gradually improve soon, and universal sales can be expected. However, citizens are strictly prohibited from stockpiling in large quantities to avoid reducing the amount of available goods. If anyone dares to disobey openly or covertly, they will be severely punished without fail.

### Elderly Man in His Seventies Takes a Concubine; Wife Demands Alimony

Mei Hezhang, a native of Changzhou, former judge of the Da Li Yuan (Supreme Court), and currently practicing as a lawyer in Shanghai (also known as Jie Jie, also named Yuan, seventy years old this year), resides at 322 Fu'anfang, Anxijin Road, French Concession. He previously married a Jin woman, Xie, (forty-eight years old this year) as his wife, and they have four sons, all of whom have grown up. Five years ago, due to disagreements between Mei and Xie, they separated, with Mei providing Xie with 38 yuan per month for living expenses. Meanwhile, Mei married another woman, Zhou Yunzhen, as his second wife. Unexpectedly, Mei stopped providing Xie's living expenses, which has lasted for four years. Moreover, with the high cost of living in Shanghai recently, it is difficult for Xie to maintain her livelihood. Therefore, she informed Mei Hezhang, requesting that he pay the full amount of accumulated living expenses and increase the monthly allowance to 50 yuan in the future. Mei ignored her. Therefore, Xie hired a lawyer to sue in court. Mei's defense is that Xie relies entirely on her sons for small living expenses, so there is no need to repeatedly pester an elderly man in his seventies. He requested that Xie's claim be rejected. The court will soon issue a summons for both parties to hear the case.

### Since the Beginning of Spring, the Population Death Rate Has Increased Sharply

Exceeding One-Third Compared to Last Year: After the beginning of spring in the city, the weather has been colder than usual, coupled with the prevalence of seasonal illnesses, leading to a sharp increase in the death rate of the population. According to the corpse collection report released by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall yesterday for February, the total number of corpses collected, both adults and children, was 1,525. At the same time, the Pushen Villa collected a total of 2,625 adult corpses and 3,886 child corpses. According to the French Municipal Council, the above-mentioned number of deaths exceeds the previous year's figure by approximately one-third. A portion of the deaths is due to difficulty in finding food and starvation.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Works Department Promotes Flood Control Plan

As the season for spring floods is approaching, the Shanghai Municipal Council Works Department is also busy with flood control measures. According to the Works Department's work report for February released yesterday, regarding flood control plans for the Central and Northern Districts, the Works Department has installed flood prevention gates at the outlets of major underground drains on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. This work is currently in progress. A flood prevention slope has been built on the section of Zhaofeng Road in western Shanghai south of Yuyuan Road. Similar flood prevention slopes have also been happily built on the north and south sections of Yidingpan Road along Yuyuan Road. The demolition of the Jiangxi Road Bridge was mostly completed by the end of last month. The remaining bridge piles will also be removed by the successful bidder. The section of the Suzhou Creek near the Wenzhou Road garbage pier has been dredged, and dredging is currently underway in the section near the Macgregor Road garbage pier.

### Foreign Police Officers from the Special Police District Transferred Back to the Public Police Force

### How to Make Self-Sufficient Fertilizer - Ji Siming's Lecture at the YMCA Agricultural Science Seminar

In recent years, China has experienced an extremely serious problem: the food shortage. The flames of war are raging across the Far East, causing widespread devastation. The supply of foreign rice from overseas has been cut off. We feel that increasing food production is particularly important, and agricultural fertilizer has become a problem that must be studied. For example, Germany can produce 10 to 12 "shi" (unit of weight) of wheat per acre, while China only produces about 2 "shi" per acre, a vast difference. This is probably due to planting methods and pests, but the lack of rational fertilizer is the main cause. Plants need fertilizer, just as people need nourishment, and the principle is the same.

Classification of Fertilizers

Plants need a dozen or so kinds of fertilizers, and the most important elements are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Fertilizers are classified into self-sufficient fertilizers and commercial fertilizers. Self-sufficient fertilizers, also known as natural fertilizers, can be produced or collected by farmers themselves, such as human manure, stable manure, compost, green manure, and wood ash. Commercial fertilizers, also known as artificial fertilizers, include potassium sulfate, potassium chloride, ammonium sulfate, superphosphate, lime, and soybean cake. Direct fertilizers and indirect fertilizers are classified according to their different effects. For example, soybean cake, potassium sulfate, and sulfuric acid can directly supply plant nutrition and are called direct fertilizers. Lime and gypsum do not contain the necessary components for plant nutrition, but indirectly enable plants to grow well and increase yield, and are called indirect fertilizers. Complete fertilizers and partial fertilizers are analyzed according to whether the contained ingredients are complete or not. Animal-based fertilizers, plant-based fertilizers, mineral fertilizers, and mixed fertilizers are analyzed according to the source of the materials. Animal-based fertilizers are animal corpses and waste products, such as human excrement, stable manure, bone meal, etc. Plant-based fertilizers are plant bodies and residues from plant processing, such as soybean cake, oil cake, grass ash, green manure, etc. Mineral fertilizers are various minerals or chemical products, such as sulfuric acid, potassium sulfate, superphosphate, lime, gypsum. Mixed fertilizers are also known as compound fertilizers, and are made by mixing two or three or more of animal, plant, and mineral fertilizers, such as compost and river mud.

Analysis of Human Manure

China's rural economy is weak, and the country's industry is backward, so chemical fertilizers are very scarce. Therefore, we should focus on natural fertilizers, mainly human manure. According to agricultural statistics, the average amount of urine and feces excreted by each Chinese person per year is 820 "jin" (unit of weight). Due to differences in food, the amount for Europeans and Americans is about 750 "jin." Shanghai has a population of 3 million, so it can be estimated that the annual output of manure is 2.4 trillion "jin." Manure kings sell it to farmers for 1.5 to 1.8 yuan per "dan" (unit of weight), and the total amount is considerable. If the entire population of 500 million in the country is statistically accounted for, it would be a huge source of wealth. As for the nature of human manure, the excrement of the elderly and sick is the best because their digestion is poor and there is more residual protein, which is most valuable for plant nutrition. Children and strong men have strong digestion, and the nutrients in their excrement are weak. Although the working class eats a lot, their digestion is also strong, as is the case with pregnant women and new mothers. Human manure contains a lot of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The manure pits in the countryside should be enclosed on three sides with walls to prevent evaporation by sunlight and slow down fermentation, so that the nutrients do not evaporate. It is best to add some gypsum to make it ferment slowly. There is less rain in the north, so manure bricks can be made. In the south, where there is more rain, this is unnecessary. In hot summers, when infectious diseases are prevalent, households often add disinfectants such as Lysol and carbolic acid to kill bacteria, which is good, but it is very unfavorable because it hinders plant growth. I think that in the near future, it will be possible to invent a way to disinfect without losing the value of fertilizer and to add fragrances to reduce odor. Disinfection and odor reduction would be convenient for both households and farmers.

Livestock Fertilizer

The ingredients of livestock fertilizer are complex and decompose slowly, so it is called "cold-natured." Horse manure has strong ripening and fermentation power and is most widely used in gardens. Farmers in European countries regard livestock manure as the first kind of self-sufficient fertilizer. They have a common agricultural saying: "No livestock, no fertilizer; no fertilizer, no agriculture." Bone meal is also good. After livestock bones are heated to a high temperature and the fat is dissolved, they are crushed with a heavy press. They contain a lot of phosphorus, which fruit trees need most. There is also green manure. Plants such as soybeans, mustard greens, and wheat are turned into the soil after they have grown and become good fertilizers after a long time. They can be widely used in large quantities. Other materials such as wood ash contain large amounts of potassium carbonate, which promotes rapid germination of seeds and is also a valuable fertilizer. In short, farmers should make full use of natural fertilizers, and with the adjustment of favorable weather and geographical conditions, agricultural production will surely increase, the economy will prosper, and the goals of benefiting the country and the people will be achieved.

### Squeeze!

— Ren Yun

Overhead, *zhá zhá zhá*, vying for air supremacy; what's terrifying is that iron birds are laying eggs.

Underground, *zhá zhá zhá*, struggling for survival; what's agonizing is that ducks are seeing bran but can't eat it.

Terror and agony, humanity mostly unwilling to accept, yet people around the world, save for a few isolated corners, are universally tasting these flavors.

Before the east turns white, before the first rooster crows, the moon hangs on the forest's edge, flower shadows shift east, just when one should be sound asleep, dreaming sweet dreams, already one sees by the roadside a wriggling movement, figures flashing, you squeezing me, packed tight beside the closed shop doors. Automatically, in clusters and groups, in lines and rows. If you go only when the sky lightens, not only can you not squeeze to the front, meeting someone you know, they'll laugh at you for arriving so late to squeeze, truly a sleepyhead!

It is just that the heavens are unkind, as if deliberately playing a joke on the group squeezing for survival, sometimes it's a biting wind that cracks your skin, a heavy coat failing to warm; sometimes hailstones and snowflakes come, decorating the early spring scene; sometimes a continuous drizzle and mist, all day long; water pours from the eaves straight to your feet, your spine becoming a drainpipe from heaven to earth; both feet, from the soles, grow cold straight to above your knees, preventing you from moving. Fortunately, with people squeezing forward and pressing behind, you don't need to exert effort, sometimes shifting forward, sometimes retreating, like tides of rice, swaying left and right, so long as you... [missing text] people, behind [missing text] people... [missing text] head, again must resist... [missing text] people, attacking from the sides and front, only then, when the number is written, is your destiny to buy that day decided. You can then loosen the squeeze from front and back, take a breath, spit, call out, "Aiyo!", watching the people ahead, one by one passing [forward], and when it's your turn, you haven't made this trip in vain, achieving your goal of struggling for survival on this day. Most pitiful are those who wait a good few hours, yet can't get a number written, and even with a number, still can't buy anything. Even more unfortunate are those who can't withstand the squeeze, can't block the pushes, and if even half their body is leaning outside, without a word, they're pulled out. No matter how much you plead, you've wasted much time, enduring cold and hunger, unable to retrieve your disappointed, sorrowful heart. On the contrary, those who are aggressive, overbearing, and forcibly insert themselves, and those who have connections, can also push in out of nowhere, buying with smiling faces and leaving, truly enraging you so that smoke pours from your seven orifices, fire igniting in your heart, but ultimately you can do nothing to them: why don't you have the strength, or the connections? You can only blame your own low destiny.

Ah, Mother, squeezing in the rain, squeezing until your chest and back ache, lying in bed, not wanting to eat or drink!

Cai Bin went squeezing the day before yesterday, and unfortunately a large lump rose on his head, making him resemble Confucius, his head like an overturned bowl.

Aiyo, you're really foolish. If you can't be Mu Hong among the 108 heroes of the Water Margin, then you must be Jin Yu Nu's adversary in "Red Silk's Joy," otherwise, forget about going to squeeze.

It doesn't matter, I'm like Yang Qilang, born from heaven, no matter what happens, I'll just treat it like dusting, protect my body.

I hear that the Zhang family's coal ball stove hasn't been lit for many days.

The Li family's sister-in-law says she hasn't tasted oil for three days.

Corn flour porridge is as delicious as the Chang Xiji white japonica rice we used to eat, even sweeter and more fragrant.

Who knew that sorghum flour mixed with green vegetables could be compared to a red-beaked green parrot, equally beautiful.

One by one, item by item, saying how difficult things are: in the end, it's all destiny.

Our Confucius said, "I do not worry about poverty, but about inequality," meaning that quantity should be appropriate, and distribution should be fair.

Our Mencius also said, "The courteous do not insult others, and the thrifty do not steal from others"; it's clear that saving resources means not depriving others of what they like.

Although, this may require you to toil your muscles and bones, starve your body, endure hardship and encourage yourself, not lose your spirit, and still strive to be enterprising. As for the generally pleasure-seeking people, going in and out of singing houses and dance halls, wildly doing speculative business, warning them is not excessive. Especially since they haven't yet felt pain. It is the generally law-abiding, hard-working people who are worried every day, life is truly difficult.

"A sparrow freezes to death on the peak of the Haggan Mountains; why not fly to a place where it's easier to live?" Why couldn't it be so? But... [missing text], where can they entrust themselves? Forcibly telling them to leave their livelihood, where would they find joy? This is called having no choice, suffering thousands of trials and tribulations, only blaming their bad destiny.

Together with accomplices who are at large, including Wang Changfa, Lao Xu, and Xiao Li, at 8:10 PM the day before yesterday, they went to the flour shop opened by Wang Qiujun, a Danyang native, at 305 Wuding Road. Using both soft and hard tactics, they falsely claimed to the shop owner that they were investigators from the Shanghai Municipal Council. They asked why the shop, which had 200 bags of flour, had not registered and demanded 3,000 yuan to avoid trouble; otherwise, the goods would be confiscated and punished. The shop owner was greatly frightened, but the shop only had twenty or so bags of flour and could not pay such a large sum. Xiao Li, who was at large, then pulled out a pistol, aimed it at the shop owner's chest, monitored his actions, and prevented him from speaking out. They began to loot, seizing valuables worth more than 3,000 yuan, rushed out of the door, and fled in different directions. As a result, a shop assistant secretly followed them and reported them to a Western police officer after they entered a lane at Kang Nao Tuo Road on Dongjing Road. The police officer entered the lane with the shop assistant and arrested the thief Xiang. The accomplices took the opportunity to escape with the stolen goods. He was then taken to the Gordon Road Police Station to await investigation.

### Liu Jizan and His Wife; Marital Crisis Resolved Amicably

Liu Jizan, a Western doctor residing at No. 396 Fukkaisen Road, was born and raised in the United States. He married Yuan Lianxie, the granddaughter of Yuan Shuangqiu (Chang), a prominent official of the late Qing Dynasty. Yuan was known for her extensive social circle in Qingdao and was even elected Miss Qingdao. As a result, she enjoyed a considerable reputation in social circles.

### Social Services

Beware of Fake Telegrams. Recently, unscrupulous people have come up with strange ideas. They come to the door with a note, falsely claiming that there is a telegram or letter sent to a certain place. They issue a receipt at the time and ask for 20 to 30 yuan in national currency, instructing the recipient to go to a certain place to pick it up with the note. In fact, there is no such thing. Unaware people are often deceived by this. Readers are advised to be careful in the future. Do not pay unless you have received a telegram or message. Qi Wenjie

Alone in Shanghai, Sick. My friend, Mr. Zhang, is 23 years old and unmarried. After being ill last month, his legs suddenly became sore and painful, and his hands became numb. Later, he sought treatment from a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, who diagnosed it as rheumatism entering the bones and muscles. He took medicine for days without any effect. The numbness in his hands became even worse, and his feet were bent and unable to touch the ground, just like the paralysis of an elderly person. Mr. Zhang is a lonely traveler far from home, with no relatives to turn to. He is suffering from this strange disease and is at a loss. Therefore, he is borrowing your newspaper to humbly seek the advice of famous doctors in Shanghai on good medicine or to introduce specialists in mental disorders for diagnosis and treatment. Shen Yiqing, No. 315 Daxilu, March 10th.

Seeking a Prescription for My Grandmother's Illness. My maternal grandmother is already seventy-six years old. She is still in good health, but recently, due to various stimuli and worries, she has contracted hemoptysis. If she is usually carefree, the bleeding stops. Once she becomes angry, her phlegm contains fresh blood when she coughs, sometimes like red ink, sometimes like clotted blood. I humbly request a good prescription, and the kindness will be as great as rebirth. Chen Jingming, No. 12, Lane 2074, Jing'an Temple Road.

Respectfully Seeking a Cure for "Five Canals". My relative is an old man of seventy years, and his body is originally healthy. However, for the past two years, he has suffered from "Five Canals," meaning that he urgently needs to go to the toilet at dawn, and he cannot make it in time, which is very painful. It occurs and heals from time to time. Because he has lived in northern Jiangsu for a long time, it is inconvenient for him to come to Shanghai to seek medical treatment. I respectfully ask doctors in Shanghai to provide a radical cure, and I will be extremely grateful. Chen Zeqi.

### A Brief History of Chinese Stamps

— Kong Zhen

Stamp collecting is now almost a very common and ordinary pastime in Shanghai, but in the past it was not the case. Everyone thought that stamp collecting was a luxurious activity, and they would not hesitate to spend hundreds of gold coins to buy them. Therefore, there is such a saying in Western proverbs, that is, "Postage is the king of pastimes, and the pastime of kings," which means that only famous public figures and dignitaries are worthy of being "stamp collectors," and ordinary people cannot collect stamps. But today it is not the case. From the head of a country to people of any profession, anyone can collect stamps. The most famous stamp collectors are U.S. President Roosevelt, former U.S. President Hoover, and the late British King George V, etc. There are also many male and female stars in Hollywood who are fond of this. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes said: "Stamp collecting is a decisive event in a person's day. It is very helpful for those who are tired from work, because in their spare time, casually flipping through a stamp album can rejuvenate their spirits. It is even more beneficial for education, as it can increase the infinite interest of innocent children in history and geography." From this, we can see the interest of stamp collecting. The postage stamps of various countries in the world were first created in England (in 1840 AD, around the 20th year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty). China adopted this method very late. It was not until the fourth year of Guangxu that official postage stamps were in general use, so China's postal history is very short (with the exception of small countries that were newly established after the European War). The trend of stamp collecting did not have more collectors until the fifth or sixth year of the Republic of China, so stamp shops should have been opened since that time.

The official postage stamps of China issued in the former Qing Dynasty included dragon patterns, goose patterns, and several commemorative stamps, such as the Xuantong Enthronement, Empress Dowager Cixi's Longevity Picture, etc. During the warlord era, Zhang Zuolin also issued postage stamps of the Grand Marshal of the Army and Navy, but this type of postage stamp was only used in the few provinces under his jurisdiction, so it was rare on the market and the price was very high. Many commemorative stamps were issued in the twenties of the Republic of China, such as Sun Yat-sen's state funeral, the Restoration Commemoration, the Tan Yankai Commemoration, the Constitution Commemoration stamps, the Republican Commemoration, the New Life Movement, etc. Ordinary postage stamps were almost all portraits of Sun Yat-sen, portraits of martyrs, etc., but in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, an interesting incident occurred with the Sun Yat-sen stamps, that is, the difference between the so-called single circle and double circle. Because the postage stamps at that time were entrusted to the De La Rue & Co. to print, the Westerners did not understand the meaning of the Kuomintang party emblem, and they actually added a circle to the white sun, including the seven types of 1-cent, 2-cent, 4-cent, 2-jiao, 1-yuan, 2-yuan, and 5-yuan. These were commonly known as the double-circle stamps of the Sun Yat-sen portrait. Although the government ordered corrections by telegram, many of them were already in general use outside. In 1939, the "150th Anniversary Commemorative Stamps of the United States" were also issued. At the end of June last year, the "Frugality and National Construction Stamps" were issued.

Shanghai is the largest commercial port in the country, so it is also the general distribution center for the stamp collecting market in the country, so even slight changes can affect the entire country. Stamp shops in Shanghai are scattered everywhere, and books on stamps are also emerging day by day, but the prices are expensive, so stamp collecting is a difficult task in this year!

Sports News

### Fan Report: Li Huitang Safe in Hong Kong; Xu Wenkui, Cao Qiuting, etc. Also in Hong Kong

News from Hong Kong's football community has attracted the attention of Shanghai football fans. Feng Jingxiang, Meng Yiliang, Cai Shengsen, etc., have decided to come to Shanghai. Whether they can arrive this week is still uncertain. As for Li Huitang, etc., we received a letter yesterday from Mr. Wang of St. John's University, stating that he is still in Hong Kong, which will be welcome news to fans. Here is the letter: Today, I read in your newspaper that Feng Jingxiang, etc., will come to Shanghai from Hong Kong, which is very gratifying. However, regarding the whereabouts of Li Huitang, I learned that he is still safe in Hong Kong, because I recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Before leaving Hong Kong (about two weeks ago), I personally saw Mr. Li on Queen's Road. I have also seen other Shanghai players, such as Xu Wenkui, Cao Qiuting, etc., all in good health. Can you tell the football fans in Shanghai about this? Li Yichen is also still in Hong Kong and is also doing well. The last football game in Hong Kong was on December 7th (Sunday) last year, approximately between the Eastern team and the Engineers. Because the situation has become tense, it was not held. Also, Cai Huiquan, who performed tennis in Hong Kong before, and his American partner Hammon are still in Hong Kong. Tao Guanqiu (i.e., Tao Mao Nü) is probably still living at Mr. Xu's place, and his skills have greatly improved.

Commercial News

### Black Market for Currency Soars Past 20,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday was Arbor Day, and black markets in various cities were also closed. The black market for cash currency, continuing the upward momentum of the previous afternoon, soared in price among scattered retail investors, with the price exceeding 20,000 yuan. Transactions were made at 20,200 yuan, with a high of 20,400 yuan, an increase of another 1,000 yuan or more compared to the previous day. The price of gold jewelry rose by 100 yuan per tael to 2,100 yuan, with a discount of 200 yuan for incoming goods. Silver rose again by 2 yuan, listed at 21 yuan. The black market rose to 19 yuan. Japanese military currency passed the 7-yuan mark, reaching 7.15 yuan, it is said.

### Bank Clearing House Establishes Separate Central Reserve Bank Note Account

The Shanghai Banking Joint Reserve Committee yesterday sent a circular to various banks and financial institutions stating that the cash deposits of all peer institutions with the committee as of March 8th of this year will be accepted and paid in old legal currency from March 9th onwards. The committee will open separate Central Reserve Bank Note accounts for each depositing bank and financial institution to account for the deposits of Central Reserve Bank Note instruments.

### Sugar Prices Rise Daily

In recent days, sugar prices have seen new records due to the gradual and rapid rise of military currency. The current market price for 24 coarse white sugar is 65.75 yuan in military currency, and Dutch red sugar is 60.075 yuan. However, the combined price for coarse white sugar has reached 460 yuan, and the situation for other types of sugar can be inferred from this. There has also been buying and selling of cooperative sugar shares recently. Yesterday, coarse white sugar shares initially traded at 240 yuan, then rose to 255 yuan. Red sugar shares rose from 232 yuan to 250 yuan. The sugar supplied to retailers for this month has been fully distributed, totaling 30,000 bags, it is said.

### Dried Lily Bulbs Rise Again

Due to low sales and market stability, dried lily bulbs have attracted considerable attention from hoarders. As a result, the market rose again yesterday. The highest-quality goods reached 180 yuan in the market yesterday, an increase of 20 to 30 yuan, it is said.

### Xianglian Lotus Seeds Maintain Strong Uptrend

Because the source of Xianglian lotus seeds is related to the transportation of military currency, market prices have risen sharply again. Prices have been raised by more than 100 yuan in recent days, and the market price yesterday was 750 yuan, with signs of further tightening.

### Summer Woolen Fabrics and Textiles Rise Even More

Recently, the supply of woolen fabrics and textiles has become very tight. Because the Mao Textile Production and Sales Union organized by the Sihui trade has been formally established, the restriction on movement has not become a reality. There is a lot of hot money in Shanghai, and outside hoarders are increasing their activity. Major wholesalers within the industry all treat their goods like treasures and are mostly unwilling to offer prices. Tailors are showing great interest, and merchants from Shanghai and Nanjing are actively purchasing. Single operators from various routes are active, resulting in a shortage of goods in the market, and prices continue to soar. The intensity of the price increases can be said to be the first time seen this year. The price increases for summer goods are particularly sharp, because the supply is even more scarce and the demand is even greater. Yesterday, Ewo's power strips were being wholesaled for 63 yuan per yard (the opening price was 45 yuan, and they were only selling for 38 or 39 yuan last year). Zhanghua's patterned Fanding fabric was being sold for 75 yuan per yard (the red-market price was 65 yuan, and they were only selling for 53 or 55 yuan last year). Baoxin's ramie cloth was being sold for 5.8 yuan (the red-market price was 5 yuan, and they were only selling for 3.7 to 3.8 yuan last year), which can also be used to assess the speed of the price increases.

### Cigarettes Fly High

Cigarette prices continue to rise sharply, because military currency continues to rise, and people in all quarters are optimistic. Those who hold goods are even more eager to sell, so prices are soaring. The selling price for Great Britain brand cigarettes has reached 8,400 yuan per case, Old Knife brand is 7,400 yuan, Five Flowers brand is 4,900 yuan, Pinhai brand is 6,700 yuan, and Little Fairy brand is 5,000 yuan. The price increases for Japanese cigarettes are the most sharp, with Golden Gun brand reaching 2,450 yuan, Golden Building is 2,700 yuan, Red Rose brand is 3,600 yuan, and Quanlu brand is 2,850 yuan. 25,000 cigarettes have soared by more than 400 yuan.

### Soap and Matches Rise Even More

The price of soap is rising sharply, and the selling prices of various brands have broken previous records. Sales are becoming more robust, and the market cannot be restrained. The selling price for Jigu Ben brand soap is 230 yuan per case, Baixiangmao brand soap is 220 yuan, and Huangxiangmao brand soap is 205 yuan. Matches are also popular, with Phoenix brand selling for 2,900 yuan per case and Beauty brand selling for 3,000 yuan, an increase of 300 yuan compared to before.

### Bananas (4)

— Gao Jiannong

As for the current most popular name, "Xiangjiao" (香蕉 - banana), known to all women and children, where did it come from? It originally only appeared in the *Gazetteer of Panyu County*. In the section on products, it says: "Jiao (蕉, banana), ...there are three types: 'Qingya' (靑牙, green sprout), 'Huangya' (黃牙, yellow sprout), and 'Xiangjiao' (香蕉, fragrant banana), which is fragrant and delicious." It can be seen that "Xiangjiao" was just a unique name among many types, and now it has become the general representative of this fruit. Even a slight change in name must follow the times: Suppose someone now goes to a fruit store to buy "Ganjiao" (甘蕉, sweet banana) or "Jiaozi" (蕉子, banana), they would probably stare blankly, not knowing what to do! The *Gazetteer of Panyu County* also records other types, saying: "There is a type called 'Goupanzi' (狗攀子, dog-climbing banana), a small plant that a short dog can climb, with a bland and cheap taste. There is another type with very large fruit, steamed and fed to children as a substitute for milk, called 'Weizaijiao' (喂仔蕉, baby-feeding banana). All bananas are cold in nature and should not be eaten in large quantities, except for 'Weizaijiao,' which is harmless when cooked...". From the *Illustrations and Studies of Plant Names* by Wu Qirong, citing records from *Lingnan Miscellany*, we know that bananas also have the vulgar and unseemly names "Bangchuijiao" (棒槌蕉, club banana) and "Gouyajiao" (狗牙蕉, dog-tooth banana), and even the gorgeous and charming "Rose Banana" that "smells like roses." Furthermore, from the *Notes from Southern Yue* cited by it, we can also know that "...'Xiangyajiao' (香牙蕉, fragrant sprout banana) is considered the most beautiful, also called 'Longnai' (龍奶, dragon milk)—milk, like the milk of a dragon, rare and precious!..." There are many other names, which can be confusing for a while, waiting for someone with a passion to continue the *Tea Manual*, *Lychee Manual*... and create a "Banana Manual."

According to the classification method of foreign botanists, bananas can be divided into three types: The first type is the Musa paradisiaca mentioned earlier, with large fruits that cannot be eaten raw, but can only be cooked as dishes; this probably corresponds to the "Banjiao" (板蕉, board banana), "Weizaijiao" (喂仔蕉, baby-feeding banana), or "Bangchuijiao" (棒槌蕉, club banana), etc., mentioned above. The second type is called Musa pasientnm, with smaller and more delicious fruits; the third type is called Musa sinensis—the Chinese banana—with short trunks and fragrant and sweet fruits; both of these can be eaten raw and should correspond to the "Yangjiaojiao" (羊角蕉, goat-horn banana), "Fozhi" (佛指, Buddha-finger banana), or "Longnaijiao" (龍奶蕉, dragon-milk banana), etc., mentioned earlier. But where is the difference between the second and third types? The second type has slightly larger fruits with thicker skin, which can last a long time and travel far, and the handling during transportation is simple, without the need for special equipment. As for the Chinese banana, it is easily perishable. Extra care must be taken when loading it onto ships and trains, such as wrapping it in cotton or putting it in cold storage. Therefore, the wealthy merchants who sell fruit, especially the British, prefer to transport the second type of banana.

The "raw swallow and live peel" so-called raw eating method of bananas is what everyone - speaking of people in Shanghai! - is accustomed to "tasting" and most familiar with, so there is no need to describe it. As for the cooked eating methods of bananas, it was mentioned earlier that "Weizaijiao" is steamed and then given to children to eat; now: There are two popular ways to eat bananas in northern Chinese restaurants: one is to cook it clear with rock sugar and milk sauce, and the other is to coat the banana with flour and then fry it in soybean oil. I think the famous chefs in Guangdong must have many new tricks, but unfortunately, there is no way to inquire about it! Furthermore, according to records from the biological world, the chefs in the West Indies in America have truly all kinds of ways to cook bananas, with endless variety, extravagance, and grandeur, which people in the Old World would never dare to aspire to. Moreover, the industry of drying bananas and making flour is on the rise, and in the future, we may see "banana flour" on the market in addition to lotus root flour, water chestnut flour... to supply our needs. As for making beverages and canned goods with bananas... it is well known to everyone. It is said that in Guyana, northern South America, people also make a kind of banana wine that is very popular among black people!

Each banana plant only conceives once in its life, producing one bunch, and its fruit cannot develop mature seeds, so how does it avoid the disaster of reducing species and becoming extinct? It is that the new buds under the roots of the mother plant's flower spike emerge vigorously; waiting for the mother plant to bloom and bear fruit and become something that is obtained only to be discarded, - usually people chop it off immediately - then its children can stand tall. If one acre of banana field has one thousand banana plants, harvesting twice a year - one each from the mother plant and the daughter plant - yields about two thousand bunches of fruit, each weighing twenty-five kilograms. With diligent irrigation and plenty of fertilizer, the number can be doubled. Now bananas in Shanghai sell for one or two jiao (角 - a unit of money) each, so the interest is very generous!

Spring and Autumn

### Food

— Zhou Mo

The *Strategies of the Warring States* says: "In the state of Chu, food is more valuable than jade, and firewood is more valuable than cassia. Now I eat jade and burn cassia." Today, the hardship of livelihood touches upon all aspects upon reading this. Therefore, concerning food and drink, I restate several points.

Confucius taught people to plan for the Way and not for food. However, Mrs. Confucius may have felt that even the cleverest woman cannot cook without rice. Therefore, Confucius could not help but sigh that only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know propriety and righteousness, and that eating, drinking, men, and women are the great desires of human beings, and no one does not know taste. Although he also said that a gentleman does not seek satiety in eating or comfort in dwelling, at least seeking half-satiety in eating, even if it cannot prolong life, is still a way to extend years. Therefore, when ancient people talked about food, their conclusion was simply "the people regard food as heaven." When the Queen Zhao Wei asked the envoy from Qi, "Is the year also well? Are the people also well? Is the king also well?" "If there is no year, how can there be people? If there are no people, how can there be a king?" This is also enough to show how much the ancient people valued the people's food. Han Yu's Miscellaneous Sayings says, "Therefore, even if there is a famous horse, if it is not fed enough and lacks strength, how can one expect it to travel a thousand miles?"

Looking at the past from today, and looking at the present from the future, there are many who produce, and few who eat; if those who produce are few, and those who eat are many, how can we ignore or forget this timeless and unchangeable famous argument?

### A Head Has Value

— R Yang

The red, white, and blue barber pole at the entrance of the barbershop is now spinning even more vigorously. Originally, during this time of soaring prices for coal, rice, oil, and salt, barber fees have also been catching up "head"long.

Don't mention those forty or fifty yuan "air-conditioned Kleram-Lei perms," even ordinary haircuts require two banknotes of illegal tender with just a slight bow of the head. Although this shows that "a head has value," thinking about it, it always seems a bit "uneconomical." - Sitting like being in jail for an hour or two, with one's head being tossed around, watching those strands of hair "received from one's parents" being recklessly ruined by ruthless scissors; such a loss, and still having to pay money at the end, it's really hard to explain!

Save some money and go for a trim a few days later, although it won't reach the level of "three thousand feet of white hair," that look of "hair bristling in anger" is a bit unsightly and truly deserves a spectacle; and, it is said to be unsanitary! - However, some so-called artists are an exception. Their beehive-like hairdos are highly praised, the only reason being that they are artists, and the demeanor of an artist must be "extraordinary."... This kind of demeanor is now causing envy among some people.

Sitting in the chair in the barbershop, looking at my head being molested in the mirror, I thought about these things in a disorderly manner. Suddenly, I remembered that funny verse: "Try looking at the barber, people also shave his head," and I couldn't help but feel that it had a rather profound meaning, and I began to enter into reverie.

### According to What I've Seen

— Zhong

On the filthy sidewalk, there was a puddle of vomit residue near the wall, and a black dog sniffed it and ran away. Then came a disheveled female beggar, draped in a sack, greedily grabbing the gray grains of rice and sending them to her mouth, making it her meal in no time!

At the entrance of a lumberyard, there lay a dying beggar, his face ginger yellow, constantly shaking his head, seemingly making a final struggle with death. The lumberyard boss came out to scold him, drive him away, pull him, and kick him. Finally, he had no choice but to give him two mao (毛 - a unit of money) to ask him to leave. The money fell on the ground, and the beggar lay still, stiff, and died.

A young and very handsome young man had just come out of a tea and snack shop, holding a package of biscuits. With a turn, the biscuits were snatched away, and his hat also fell to the ground. The young man flew after them, catching the thief, who hadn't had time to open the package, and punching and kicking him, extraordinarily brave, not even wanting his hat anymore. As a result, the biscuits were crushed on the ground, and the thief lay there, sobbing, willing to return the biscuits.

The bystanders all said in unison: "So-so, picking up the hat is more important," but this young man seemed to think that the biscuits and hat could be abandoned, but this anger could not be left unvented.

### Eastern Spiritual Civilization

— Gongji

To say "strolling through the market" to someone living in Beijing is as "leisurely" as saying "going to Guanqian" to someone living in Suzhou. The market refers to Dong'an Market, while Guanqian is the name of a street. From the word "strolling" (逛) in "strolling through the market," we can know that it doesn't necessarily mean going to buy things. And friends who go to Guanqian are mostly with mouths full of pine nut candy or sunflower seeds. Their purpose is just to "stroll" or "walk around" to pass the time that cannot be gotten rid of. For example, a Beijing resident who lives off rental income (commonly known as "eating tiles"), gets up early, goes to Central Park or Beihai Park for a stroll, hides in the depths of pines and cypresses, and practices a bit of Tai Chi. Then, he sits in a teahouse, orders a pot of "fragrant tea" or "Longjing," and chats with friends he sees every day. At noon, they take turns being the "host" at a small restaurant: four liang (兩 - a unit of weight) of baijiu (white liquor), a few steamed buns, a few plates of assorted stir-fried dishes, buying a drunken and satisfied meal. Drunkenly, he runs to Liulichang to sit in antique shops and talk in calligraphy and painting shops. When spring comes, he goes to Chongxiao Temple to see peonies. When autumn comes, he goes to West Mountain to admire maple leaves. Day by day, he transforms himself from a remnant young man into a remnant old man. A Suzhou resident who lives off farmland, the first thing he does after getting out of bed is to go to a teahouse. He eats a snack such as pig trotter noodles or shrimp and crab noodles. He adds embellishments and details to gossip. After lunch, he either goes to Guanqian to listen to storytelling or gathers four people in a teahouse to play mahjong. Life seems like a slapstick comedy, opening in laughter and closing in laughter. Some people use these two ways of life to represent the "spiritual civilization" of the East. The former life is like a light and tranquil "poem." The latter life is like a lively and funny "drama." Some people who go to Beijing are reluctant to leave, saying that there is a "blue sky" there. Others who go to Suzhou are unwilling to leave, saying that there is a "lovely Qiuxiang" (Qiuxiang is the main character in the "Three Smiles" story). In Shanghai, there is neither a "blue sky" nor a "lovely Qiuxiang." But if you are interested, you can discover another way of life of Eastern "spiritual civilization." Walking on the road are pairs of young men and women, so young that you can estimate that they have not graduated from university. The woman's arm is tightly hooked on the man's, hooking the man's shoulder a bit high and a bit low. One foot high and one foot low, they jump out of the movie theater and into the cafe; run out of the cafe and shrink into the dance hall again. They are as busy as a "zoetrope." It is said that there is nothing to read, let alone that their families do not need them to "mill rice"? This seems to be another kind outside of the two kinds of "spiritual civilization" lifestyle.

### On the Tram

— Jian

A's banknotes in his pocket are stolen by B. A: (grabs B's hand) (angrily) Why did you take the banknotes from my pocket?

B: (pleadingly) Sorry, it's too crowded, a mistake in the midst of business!

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— Hejia Branch

(2) Sorrow and Joy

Wei Cheng was sitting on the edge of the bed, his body leaning, as Mrs. Ye Da stretched a dry hand out from under the covers. Everyone asked her what she wanted. He Ma flashed in, not knowing when. She said, "Second young mistress, why don't you feed her a spoonful of water?" The second young mistress fed Mrs. Ye Da a spoonful of ginseng-infused soup, very peacefully. Her hand was still stretched out. Wei Cheng said, "I know, Mom always likes to stroke my hair, she only thinks I'm still a five or six-year-old child." Wei Cheng lowered his head to bring it closer to his mother's hand. Mrs. Ye Da opened her hand and did indeed stroke the back of Wei Cheng's head. Only Wei Cheng noticed that his mother's hand had no strength at all. It wasn't stroking, but just pressing the palm of her hand against it.

He Ma saw that it was okay to speak and said, "Young master, the maternal uncle said that he is asking the young master to go outside so that Mr. Huang can write the prescription. The maternal uncle has something to discuss with the young master." Wei Cheng was still reluctant to part. The eldest and second young mistresses both said, "Mr. Huang won't wait. He is a famous doctor. Getting a number so early and inviting him out, only Shidetang (世德堂) could invite him. He has given us great face. Wei Cheng, go quickly." Wei Cheng put Mrs. Ye Da's hand inside the covers and pressed it once on the surface of the covers before standing up and walking out. Cui Zhen didn't know what she said to the eldest young mistress. The eldest young mistress said, "Wei Cheng, when you go outside, don't let the tears flow and wipe your eyelids with a handkerchief." Wei Cheng said, "I know." Cui Zhen handed over a handkerchief. She was still holding a tray of foreign candles in her hand.

The sky was clear and the sun was bright, but inside the house, there was only a dismal fog and gloomy clouds. He Ma led Wei Cheng to a room opposite the Shuangmei Study, where he saw Huang Shipu holding a water pipe, using smoking to ponder; on one side was Li Youxie, and on the other was Second Mrs. Ye; the table was covered with writing brushes and paper. Li Youxie urged: "Wei Cheng, you've come. Mr. Huang originally refused to write a prescription, but now Second Sister-in-law and I have strongly persuaded him. Mr. Huang has already written one here on the prescription. But Mr. Huang also has something to say to you." Wei Cheng nodded to Huang Shipu. (21)

Miscellaneous Talks on the Arts

### Yangge

— Zefu

It is said that Yangge originated in Ding County, Hebei, and was created by Su Dongpo in the Song Dynasty. The farmers near Heilong Spring in Ding County mostly grew rice. Every time it was time for transplanting rice seedlings, the farmers would sing this kind of song to relieve their labor, so it was named Yangge (transplanting song). In the beginning, it was just short songs, and it is still so in the Beijing area today. When singing, one must step on sturdy wood, called Gaoqiao (high stilts). (Some say that this is the original intention of preventing mud from splashing on the rice fields.) Each song has four lines, each line with seven characters, linked together to form a story. Later, it was transformed into a performance, without the use of stilts, purely a dramatic form. In addition to being popular in Ding County, the Shandong and Shanxi areas also had their traces. The roles include the elderly male, young male, young female, painted face, and clown. The instruments include the gong, drum, cymbals, and small cymbals, without the accompaniment of string and bamboo instruments, which still preserves the original form. The plays performed are mostly love affairs between men and women and family trivia, such as "Blue Bridge Meeting," "Ding Lang Seeking His Father," "Brick Topping," etc., which are quite popular with the general public. However, the lyrics sometimes involve obscenity, so they are sometimes banned by local authorities. In recent years, those engaged in this profession have wanted to reform it, so they adopted Peking Opera and adapted new plays, such as "Guan Wang Temple" and "Sitting in the Building Killing Xi," but looking at the themes, it is still difficult to escape its original form.

### A Collection of Glimpses

— Superfluous

A new store has opened, with a long snake array of two on both sides, like a double dragon grabbing a pearl, gathered at the entrance of the store. Heads are rolling, vying with each other. What the store sells is neither coal nor rice. Approaching to see it, it is a "Tobacco and Sundries Shop."

A certain second-hand store on a certain road paints its door and posts a telephone number ×××××, with a homophonic note beside it saying "Eating people makes meat thin."

Pages of Life

### The Same Heart

— Wubao

The business in the foreign firm has already stopped. Although the foreign masters are crestfallen, their lives are not yet in trouble. The compradors (Chinese managers), who have always considered themselves high-class Chinese and are skilled at maneuvering, naturally also have ways. The most bitter are those in our class, who are neither high nor low, of coolie laborers.

According to the current prices, if the rice bowl is not broken, we can barely get by. Now that we have become unemployed vagrants, if we don't return to our hometowns, we will only starve to death. But going home also requires travel expenses. We have already been cutting flesh to heal sores, moving east and west, so now we are naturally unable to find help. Thinking over and over, we can only ask the foreign masters and high-class Chinese to show mercy and give us several months of severance pay.

More than a dozen poor colleagues gathered together and debated the issue of severance pay. Some advocated asking for six months, some advocated three months, but some also advocated one year. Just as everyone was discussing, the comprador came slowly.

Although he was worried in his heart, he wore a smile on his face, and his attitude when talking to us had changed from that of a superior to that of a friend. First, he described in detail and with tears the various pains and losses he had suffered. Then, he talked about how much he sympathized with us, wishing he could take on the burden of life for us. But in the end, he was unable to do what he wanted and unable to help.

Among the poor colleagues, there were also those who had suffered grievances on weekdays. Today, since the rice bowl has already been broken anyway, they began to complain "like a river breaking its banks." They said that he had never cared about our lives on weekdays, and now he "doesn't care about the dead." Some even said, "You have been a comprador for ten years, and your family assets are over a million. This million in assets is all from the labor and effort of our colleagues. Now you should take out some to help us."

These words naturally made the comprador uncomfortable. At the time, there were many people talking at once, and it was difficult to distinguish the arguments clearly, and he was not allowed to show a stern face. Fortunately, there were a few good people who did their best to suppress the anger, and at the same time urged the comprador to reconsider, agreeing to talk again at a later date. In the end, they didn't make things awkward. However, the road ahead is long. If we continue to fight hard like this, I'm afraid we will eventually get the boot!

### Reaction

— Yan Shi

After reading the article "Woman, Dog, Man," it gave the female world a major stimulus invisibly. However, because I myself am also a part of those being stimulated, I can't help but produce a kind of reaction to adapt to the environment.

It's a pity that this "he" was unfortunately abandoned by the woman "he loved," and painfully transferred his love to a small dog "he originally hated." He finally discovered his true friend at the last moment. But it's a pity that he discovered it too late. Why not be more proactive and befriend the dog directly!

### Contradiction

— Yu'er

When Mr. Wang in the front building talked to people about the problem of life, he would definitely say: "There are too many children, and the standard of living is so high. My meager income makes it quite difficult to maintain the family's life." Indeed, there are seven children in his family. Counting him and his wife, there are nine people. Eating two bowls of rice per meal, one dan (石 - a unit of volume) of rice a month is "more than enough." The expense of rice alone is already close to three hundred yuan. Counting the other expenses, thirty-one plus thirty-one, it would naturally be four or five hundred yuan a month. In this year, earning this amount of money is indeed not easy. He said: "If it were just my wife and me, wouldn't the expenses be much less?" After speaking, he sighed repeatedly and spoke in a tone of scolding the children. Also, the second landlord's wife often used the excuse of having many children to increase the rent, and sometimes, if the children made a little noise, she would start scolding loudly. Therefore, Mr. Wang always frowned. When he was annoyed, he treated the children as vents, scolding them "to death," sometimes even hitting them hard. "Big creditors, small creditors." This is the common expression that he and his wife used to call their children, especially Mr. Wang. Looking at it this way, do they dislike having too many children?

Recently, I often heard Mrs. Wang in the front building "gagging! gagging!" sounds of vomiting. According to Mom, she is pregnant.
