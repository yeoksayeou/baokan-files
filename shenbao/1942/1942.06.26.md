### Japanese Headquarters Announce Occupation of Two Aleutian Islands Expanding Gains on Nearby Islands

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:00 this morning that Japanese naval and land forces attacked the Aleutian Islands, occupied Kiska Island on the 7th of this month, and Attu Island on the 8th of this month. They are now expanding their gains on nearby islands.

Lisbon, 24th (Domei News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department has acknowledged that Japanese forces landed on Attu Island in the Aleutian Islands on the 17th.

Aleutian Islands, Kiska Island, 25th (Domei News Agency) - Kiska Island, occupied by the Japanese army, has been temporarily renamed "Narukami Island" by the local Japanese naval forces in commemoration. The island was previously an unnamed place on American maps. Attu Island has also been temporarily renamed "Netsudo Island" to signify its capture in mid-June.

A Certain Japanese Base in the North Pacific, 25th (Domei News Agency) - With the Japanese army occupying Kiska and Attu Islands in the Aleutian Islands on June 7th and 8th, the United States has lost its last possible route to attack the Japanese mainland, namely the northern route via the Aleutian Islands. In the past six months, the United States has suffered consecutive defeats in the Southwest Pacific and has lost two possible routes of attack against Japan: one from Hawaii to Manila, and the other from Australia to the East Indies. The Japanese navy has now shifted its forces from the Southwest Pacific to attack the North Pacific, making a sudden landing in the Aleutian Islands. The Japanese naval air force launched a fierce attack on Dutch Harbor, a crucial U.S. naval base in the Aleutian Islands, on June 4th, destroying its aircraft hangars, oil tanks, and other important military targets. The army and navy then landed on Kiska and Attu.

Militarily Essential

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) - After the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the capture of Attu and Kiska Islands in the Aleutian Islands, the entire nation of Japan was extremely excited. Attu and Kiska Islands are northern fortresses of the United States and, along with Dutch Harbor, are the most important bases. Therefore, in this operation in the Eastern Pacific, the Japanese army first targeted them as objectives for conquest. After suffering defeat in this battle, the U.S. military authorities claimed that the two locations were of no value, attempting to cover up their loss and console themselves. However, various newspapers in the U.S. have launched fierce attacks against the government because, if the U.S. government and military authorities deemed the area valueless, why did they spend huge sums of money to strengthen its military facilities? Therefore, the Japanese army's capture of Attu and Kiska Islands makes it difficult to protect Dutch Harbor. This is tantamount to cutting off the right arm of the United States. On the Japanese side, these islands can be used as bases to control the throat of Alaska and the American mainland. The United States had built airfields and submarine bases there as strongholds for attacking Japan. Now, not only have these lost their effectiveness, but the Japanese army can use them as forward bases to deal a severe blow to the American and British forces. At the same time, the Japanese defense waters in the north can be steadily expanded.

General Overview of the Two Islands

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) - Kiska Island, occupied by the Japanese army, is located in the westernmost part of the Aleutian Islands, about two kilometers east of Attu Island. It is, along with Dutch Harbor and Attu Island, one of the most important American bases for attacking Japan. It is 32 miles wide from east to west and 6 miles long from north to south. The entire island has no trees or forests, only moss and cotton-like vegetation. The mountains, resembling backbones, rise to 1,230 meters at the northern end and 366 to 457 meters in the south. The coastline is mostly steep with cliffs and rocks. The southeast coast is mountainous with many bays and rocks. Kiska is the only good harbor on the island, accessible to foreign ships. The harbor has military facilities. There are some indigenous white residents who mostly raise foxes. There are no Japanese residents. Attu Island is the westernmost island in the Aleutian Islands and the final island in American territory. The island is about 35 miles long and 20 miles wide, with many harbors. The island is mountainous, with some peaks reaching 914 meters. The island's coast has many reefs, so ships navigating near it must be especially cautious. The island has a small harbor called Chichagof, a good anchorage for ships with a draft of 4.3 meters or less. However, it is difficult to find a harbor in bad weather, so ships must be cautious when entering. At the head of the harbor is a small Aleut village called Attu, with a church and a private trading post. Ships belonging to the U.S. Coast Guard stop there every year. There is little contact with the outside world. At the east entrance, a slanted conical rock called "Pissatta" serves as a landmark for ships entering the harbor. The island has a U.S. Navy radio station and a weather station.

### Japanese Forces Capture Lishui Yesterday Airfield Also Occupied

Central Zhejiang, 25th (Domei News Agency) - At 10:00 this morning, the Japanese army in central China reported that Lishui and its airfield in the southern part of Zhejiang Province have been occupied. The Japanese army seized Taipingfang, ten kilometers northwest of the area, yesterday morning and captured Lishui at 5:00 PM. The Japanese army advanced south of Wuyi towards evening on Sunday and, after entering Taipingfang, made military deployments and attacked Lishui. Japanese planes bombed incessantly.

Jinhua, 20th (Domei News Agency) - The Lishui airfield is located on a high ground three kilometers northeast of Lishui city. It is the forwardmost airbase closest to Japan. Since last year, under American guidance, it, along with Quzhou and Yushan, has been expanding its runways and enhancing other facilities. The runway is about 1,800 meters long, allowing heavy bombers to take off and land freely. In the nearby forests, there are scattered parking areas, ammunition depots, and fuel depots. It is a purely American-style modern airfield. After April of this year, due to continuous bombing by Japanese aircraft, it was not completed and was largely destroyed. Repairs were then started, but only about one-fifth of the work was completed when the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign was launched. The Chongqing government, deeply fearing a Japanese attack, destroyed the main parts themselves.

### Dr. Fox Broadcasts on Radio

Tianjin, 25th (Domei News Agency) - Dr. Fox, an American who has been the publisher and editor of the North China Star for 25 years, recently broadcast on Tianjin Radio before going to Shanghai to await repatriation, bidding farewell to his readers. He stated that if Americans could read Japanese and have a thorough understanding of Japan, just as the Japanese read English and understand America, the current war between the two countries could be avoided. Although Japan and the United States are now at war, he still considers his Japanese readers and colleagues as friends. America's misunderstanding of Japan is the major cause of the Pacific War. He knows that there are hundreds or thousands of Japanese who know English and are familiar with American affairs, but it is regrettable that there are no more than ten Americans who can write and read Japanese and truly understand Japan. The views of British and American leaders have a concrete impact on the policies of the two countries. If they could read Japanese and regularly read Japanese newspapers and magazines, mutual sympathy and understanding between Britain, America, and Japan could be realized. Fox thanked the Japanese authorities for the fair and courteous treatment he received during his detention, and said that after returning to the United States, he would tell Americans that no one treats enemy people better than the Japanese.

Washington, 28th (Havas News Agency)

President Roosevelt hosted King Peter of Yugoslavia at the White House today. Many key members of the U.S. government were invited to accompany them.

### British House of Commons to Debate the War Situation Members Jointly Propose a Motion of No Confidence in the Government

London, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Lord Privy Seal and Deputy Prime Minister Clement Attlee has announced that the House of Commons will debate the situation in Libya on the second and third days after it convenes. Prime Minister Churchill is expected to return from the United States and participate in the debate. Conservative MP Milner has proposed a motion of no confidence today. According to Attlee, this motion will serve as the basis for the debate.

London, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Twenty members of the House of Commons have jointly proposed a motion of no confidence, stating: "This House expresses its admiration for the courage and endurance displayed by the Imperial forces under particularly difficult circumstances but cannot express confidence in the central command."

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - The British Parliament is deeply dissatisfied with the British army's defeat in North Africa. According to the Associated Press in London, the British opposition party formally submitted a motion of no confidence in Churchill's cabinet to the House of Commons on the evening of the 23rd. It is reported that the reason for their lack of confidence is their opposition to the current cabinet's method of directing the war. The signatories of the motion of no confidence include prominent figures in British politics such as Lloyd George, Labor leader Clement Attlee, and Conservative dissidents such as Brendan Bracken and members of the National Liberal Party. It is reported that the motion is intended to be discussed when Churchill returns from his visit to the United States and the House discusses the war. At that time, the government and the opposition will engage in a fierce debate.

### Roosevelt Convenes Pacific Military Conference All Relevant Countries Send Representatives Rumors of Opening a Second Front are Rampant

Buenos Aires, 25th (Domei News Agency) - U.S. Presidential Secretary O’Reilly announced yesterday that President Roosevelt has convened a special meeting of the Pacific Military Committee to be held today. British Prime Minister Churchill and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King will attend. In addition, the President has invited congressional leaders to meet with Prime Minister Churchill at the White House today. Washington's diplomatic circles believe that Churchill's main purpose is to discuss opening a second front in Europe, which is gaining increasing traction. Other observers believe that Roosevelt and Churchill intend to adopt an offensive plan for the Allied nations. Today’s special meeting of the Pacific Military Committee aims to explain this plan in detail so that each representative can report back to their respective governments.

Washington, 28th (Havas News Agency) - President Roosevelt is scheduled to convene a temporary meeting of the Pacific Supreme Military Council tomorrow. In addition to representatives from Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and China, the Netherlands will also send representatives to participate. It is reported that President Roosevelt wants to take advantage of Prime Minister Churchill's arrival in Washington to convene this meeting, but according to various sources, no special issues will be brought up for discussion. In addition, Admiral Cunningham, former commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet and chief representative of the British naval delegation, has arrived here.

Lisbon, 25th (Domei News Agency) - The New York Times recently announced for the first time the differences in opinion between British Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt regarding the war strategy. It is said that when Prime Minister Churchill delivered a message to the House of Commons at the beginning of the war in Libya, he seemed to have learned that the British Eighth Army would engage in war with General Rommel. There was no defensive equipment from Gazala to the Halfaya Pass line. General Ritchie, in this situation, knew that it would be difficult to hold out for long. Churchill also knew that Roosevelt, after Molotov's urgent request, had agreed to transport munitions to the Soviet Union. Therefore, Churchill and Roosevelt argued over the telephone line over the priority of transporting munitions. However, Roosevelt, given the threat to the Pacific and Alaska, also needed to allocate munitions to those two locations. Churchill failed to get his way over the phone and decided to make a special trip to Washington to negotiate this matter with Roosevelt. Churchill also demanded that all forces be immediately concentrated in Libya, but Roosevelt, under pressure from American diplomats, military leaders, congressmen, and politicians, asked Churchill to first send the millions of British troops stationed in the rear to the battlefield, pointing out that the British Isles still had a large amount of munitions that could be used. On the contrary, other battlefields were severely lacking munitions. Roosevelt's intention was to have the British army use its existing munitions to launch an offensive in Europe, but the British did not agree. Churchill insisted that the issue of ship tonnage should be resolved first; otherwise, launching an offensive in Europe and opening a second front would inevitably fail.

Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Havas News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Berlin in the "Gazette de Lausanne," German circles express deep skepticism about the possibility of opening a second front, as reported by the British and Americans, and believe that this is, in fact, impossible. Observing the public announcements from the British and American sides, it is further felt that the British and American staffs have no serious plans for this, as such an important military operation would certainly be kept strictly secret and should never be disclosed in advance. Moreover, given the defensive fortifications set up by the German garrison on the European coast, even if the British and Americans act rashly, they will fail. Germany can increase its troops and military supplies from its headquarters and other locations at any time. Since the outbreak of the current war, Germany has always adopted a policy of preparedness, and the authorities have made special preparations for this long ago, to say nothing of it. In short, from Norway to the Bay of Biscay, the defense is thorough, with no gaps to be exploited. The British themselves may doubt their chances of success.

British King Approves Anglo-Soviet Treaty

Lisbon, 25th (Domei News Agency) - According to a report from London, the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance was signed and approved by King George VI of England yesterday.

Lisbon, 24th (Domei News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch, after the deterioration of the European war situation, the military alliance treaty signed between Britain and the Soviet Union in the past has rapidly taken effect. Foreign Secretary Eden requested the House of Commons on the 24th to immediately pass the ratification of the treaty. According to Eden, such treaties were previously reserved in meetings. Ratification only began on the 21st. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has already approved this treaty, so it is hoped that the British House of Commons will also cooperate to approve it.

Lisbon, 25th (Domei News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, the U.S. War Department has announced the establishment of the U.S. Army's European Theater of Operations, commanded by Major General Eisenhower.

Ankara, 25th (Agence Havas) - A delayed report from Baghdad (the capital of Iraq) last night stated that the U.S. forces stationed near Baghdad left Baghdad for Palestine over the weekend. The U.S. military has now changed its original plan and is rushing to the Egyptian front. The U.S. forces moving include a mechanized division of 11,000 men, about half of the U.S. forces that landed in Palestine three weeks ago.

### Anglo-American Labor Union Cooperation Issues

London, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trades Union Congress, recently visited the United States to foster close relations between the labor unions of Britain and the United States and to discuss ways to cooperate with the Soviet labor unions.

### Diplomatic Exchange Ship Asama Maru Anchors in Yokohama Carries 416 Nationals of Allied Countries Including U.S. Ambassador Grew and His Wife

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this afternoon that the Japanese mail ship Asama Maru, carrying 416 nationals of enemy countries, including 142 diplomats, departed from Yokohama at 1:35 PM today to exchange Japanese diplomats and nationals with the enemy countries in Lourenço Marques. The Asama Maru will also stop at Saigon in Hong Kong to pick up more nationals of enemy countries. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew and his wife boarded the ship at 1:00 PM, deeply moved, as they had been envoys to Japan for many years and were now returning home under such circumstances, which was completely unexpected. As for the key Japanese figures returning home on the American side, they include Ambassador to the United States Admiral Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu, who went to the United States last November. In addition, the repatriation ship from Shanghai, the Italian mail ship Conte Verde, is scheduled to depart on the 29th of this month and meet the Asama Maru near Singapore before sailing to Lourenço Marques.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on the 25th that regarding the mutual exchange of diplomatic personnel and nationals between Japan and the United States, negotiations had been conducted through neutral countries acting as representatives of the interests of Japan and the United States. Japan and the United States have decided to implement the first exchange. The first exchange will involve about 1,500 people (including Thais). The American exchange ship departed from New York on the 18th. The Japanese exchange ship Asama Maru also departed from Yokohama on the 25th. The Italian ship Conte Verde is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 27th and sail to Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa, the site of the exchange. The Japanese diplomatic personnel being exchanged include Ambassador to the United States Kichisaburo Nomura, Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu, Minister to Washington Kaname Wakasugi, Ambassador to Brazil Itaro Ishii, Minister to Canada Kiyotsugu Yoshizawa, Minister to Mexico Yoshiaki Miura, Minister to Panama Toshimi Dairiki, Minister to Peru Tatsuki Sakamoto, Minister to Colombia Tsuneo Yanai, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to Venezuela Jun Omi, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to Cuba Sakae Nanjo, and the Consul-General in Haiti.

### Indian Anti-British Movement Becomes More Intense

Zurich, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press report from New Delhi, Gandhi, leader of the Indian National Congress Party, in order to realize the demand for British withdrawal from India, has decided to immediately begin implementing a new form of anti-British movement. It is expected that all members of the National Congress Party and Gandhi's followers will participate. This movement is rumored to be a heated mass movement, and its situation will be the same as the 1930 Indian movement to reject the British and boycott British goods. As for the method of implementing the new movement, it has already been drawn up, that is, Gandhi will send a letter to Viceroy Linlithgow, requesting him to approve of his demands. If a satisfactory reply is not given within a week, the new movement will be implemented immediately. In 1930, Gandhi sent an ultimatum to then Governor-General Irwin, and then implemented street parades. People in New Delhi believe that Gandhi will personally take to the streets this time, just as in 1930, to command the new movement.

### Argentine President Resigns

Buenos Aires, 24th (Havas News Agency) - President Ortiz has submitted his resignation to Congress because his eye disease cannot be cured, following the advice of his doctors. This is the second time that the president has submitted his resignation due to illness. The first time was in August 1940, when it was rejected by a unanimous vote of Congress. Once this resignation is approved by Congress, the president may deliver a radio address to the nation, clarifying Argentina's mission in the world crisis. President Ortiz's decision to resign this time has led many to believe that there is no hope of curing his eye disease. Dr. Castroviejo, a famous Spanish ophthalmologist, recently came here to treat him and said that surgery could be performed, but the president's personal physician said that the patient has had chronic diabetes for a long time, his physique is weak, and it is difficult to perform surgery. The president has decided to retire and is preparing to move from the presidential palace to a private residence in order to recuperate carefully.

Buenos Aires, 25th (Agence Havas) - Argentine Vice President Castillo stated at an intelligence meeting last night, "I will respond in writing to the President's resignation." He declined to comment on the President's resignation and denied rumors from the United States that the Argentine cabinet was facing a crisis.

Buenos Aires, 25th (Agence Havas) - The Argentine Congress will hold a joint session at 3:00 PM this Sunday to discuss the resignation of President Ortiz. This is the first official announcement after the President's resignation.

### Venezuelan President Arrives in Cuba from Mexico

Havana, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Venezuelan President Pérez arrived here today from Mexico.

### German-Thai Amity Symbol

Bangkok, 25th (Agence Havas) - Yesterday was Thailand's National Day. The German Minister to Thailand, Dr. Wendler, gave a speech to the press, wishing Thailand prosperity. Wendler stated that June 24, 1941, was to Thailand as January 30, 1933, was to Germany. Both are of the same importance and are milestones in the histories of the two countries, as the revival of both countries began on that day. This year's National Day is celebrated amid the rising tide of new Asian and European nations resisting Anglo-American imperialism. Their people's faith in the Axis powers and their obedience to their leaders are guarantees of common victory.

### Axis Forces Capture Three Key Fortresses, Advance Seventy Miles into Egyptian Territory; Sidi Barrani Falls; Wavell Appointed British Commander in North Africa

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency telegram) - Official announcement: After breaking through British resistance on the Libyan-Egyptian border, Axis forces have invaded Egypt and occupied Sidi Barrani, a town approximately seventy kilometers inside the Egyptian border. Axis forces have also penetrated the area south of the town, and are currently pursuing British troops. After the capture of the Capuzzo Fort, Sollum, and Halfaya Pass, the gateway to Egypt, by German-Italian forces, Egyptian territory has been invaded. Military circles here comment on the Axis forces' new victory, stating that Egypt's defenses are entirely manned by Indian troops, with only a small contingent of British forces, rendering them incapable of withstanding a single blow from the German-Italian army. General Rommel's objective in the operation is to eliminate British forces, not to occupy territory.

Rome, 25th (Havas News Agency telegram) - The Italian Supreme Command announced this morning that Axis forces yesterday crushed the remaining resistance of the British Eighth Army, capturing the Capuzzo Fort, Sollum, and "Hellfire Pass" in one fell swoop. This triangular stronghold is known as the gateway to Egypt. Axis forces are pursuing the retreating enemy and have already advanced past Sidi Barrani. The military installations at Mersa Matruh have been bombed by Axis aircraft, with three enemy planes shot down. Benghazi was bombed by British aircraft, sustaining slight damage and some casualties. One British plane was shot down.

Cairo, 25th (Havas News Agency telegram) - The British Middle East Command announced this morning that British forces have abandoned Sollum and Sidi Omar. Yesterday, British mobile units attacked enemy forces throughout the day, inflicting heavy casualties. The vanguard of the Axis forces reached an area southeast of Sidi Barrani yesterday.

Cairo, 25th (Havas News Agency telegram) - A semi-official commentary on the Middle East Command's communiqué states that the enemy is advancing recklessly, but that the British strategy is to retreat to a more advantageous position for combat, regardless of territorial losses.

Istanbul, 26th (Havas News Agency telegram) - According to unconfirmed reports from Cairo, General Wavell has been appointed commander of the British Eighth Army in North Africa, succeeding General Ritchie.

Lisbon, 24th (Allied News Agency telegram) - According to a London dispatch, the British *Times* newspaper argued on the 24th for the rapid strengthening of defenses in the canal zone. The newspaper also stated that the British government is currently considering dismissing General Ritchie, the current commander of British forces in North Africa, and replacing him with General Wavell, the current commander of Indian forces. It is also planned to recall General Hales, commander of forces in Eritrea, to take responsibility for the defense of Egypt.

Berlin, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - After the fall of Tobruk in North Africa, German bomber squadrons and dive bomber squadrons immediately went into action to bomb retreating British forces. On the 21st of this month, many trucks and other vehicles were destroyed. British airfields on the west coast of Egypt have been bombed by German aircraft every night, causing numerous fires. On the 23rd of this month, German aircraft bombed British troops on the Egyptian border and strafed them with machine guns, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy along the Sollum and Sidi Barrani coastal roads. German aircraft also used heavy bombs to bomb enemy forces in the Sollum area, destroying many vehicles.

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency telegram) - Sources here in the Reich stated last night that since May 26th, German-Italian forces have captured a total of 50,000 British troops in Libya. British tank losses during the same period totaled 1,000. The exact number of artillery pieces and vehicles captured is currently unknown.

Frequent Troop Movements Suggest Major Battle Imminent on Egyptian Border

Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - As soon as the Libyan campaign concludes, the battle for Egyptian territory will soon begin. According to various indications, General Rommel's forces appear poised to launch a major offensive against the new British defensive line along the Egyptian border. Mechanized convoys have been moving frequently in the Libyan border area in recent days, within only ten miles of the Egyptian border, while the main force of the Axis powers is stationed about fifty miles away. According to reliable sources, the Axis High Command is currently undertaking large-scale preparations, redistributing all of its forces and armaments. However, the vanguard of its tank and artillery units has already advanced eastward along the coast, while German forces on the southern route are reportedly nearing the city of Umm al-Maradim. According to British sources, the British High Command is also reorganizing its forces within Egyptian territory, especially the armored vehicle units, which have suffered heavy losses in the Libyan campaign and urgently need reinforcements. General Rommel's operational plan appears to be to invade Egyptian territory through the Capuzzo Fort and Halfaya Pass, thereby constituting a major encirclement of British forces. In addition, according to naval experts, the fall of Tobruk has dealt a major blow to British merchant convoys traveling between Malta, Palestine, and Egypt. Moreover, with the Axis forces occupying the port, they have gained an excellent air base, which is sufficient to pose a direct threat to Alexandria. British convoys sailing from Alexandria to Malta must pass through the African coast occupied by Axis forces. In addition, Germany and Italy have multiple bases on Crete. Therefore, the British navy must undertake an additional task, namely protecting the supply lines to Malta. In short, the fall of Tobruk, while relieving the British navy of the task of supplying British forces in that port with military supplies, also provides the Axis powers with a route to supply their forces in North Africa. The British navy should now find a way to intercept Axis convoys. According to experts, submarine operations alone may be sufficient to disrupt German supply lines.

### Near East Now Center of International Situation; Axis Powers Likely to Invade Iran and Basra via Egypt

Istanbul, Turkey, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - Observers here generally agree that the Near East has now replaced the Soviet front as the center of the international situation. According to Danish reports, the port of Basra in southern Iran has now become the hub connecting democratic nations and separating Axis nations. If Basra remains in Allied hands, the Axis powers will have little hope of victory. If the Allies lose this fortress, the world's landscape will be altered. The Axis forces are likely to take the route through Egypt, rather than through the Caucasus, to invade the Persian Gulf. Therefore, even if a second front is opened in Europe, the Near East will still not lose its importance. If the Axis forces were to win in Egypt, Turkey would find it difficult to maintain its current neutrality.

### Egypt Tries to Avoid Involvement in War; Prime Minister Delivers Speech Urging People to Remain Calm

Cairo, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - Prime Minister Nahas recently delivered a speech at a special session of Parliament, outlining the Egyptian government's attitude towards the World War. He stated that the government should accept fate passively and strive to avoid Egypt's involvement in the war. "This is what I wish to reiterate to you." Rumors that the British government has requested the mobilization of Egyptian troops and that Egypt declare war on the Axis powers are not true, but the government has taken all precautionary measures to protect the safety of compatriots and foreigners in the event of unforeseen circumstances. It is hoped that the entire nation will remain calm and confident and not be misled by rumors. The rumor that the Axis forces plan to pass through Egypt to reach the city of Basra in southern Iraq has caused considerable unease here. Subsequently, Prime Minister Nahas announced that he had received assurances from the British government that if enemy forces were to invade Egypt, they would be driven out with all their might.

Ankara, 25th (Haitong News Agency telegram) - According to news received here from Cairo last night, influential political leaders in Egypt requested the Egyptian government to ask the British government to declare Cairo a demilitarized city and not to use the city as a military base under any circumstances. Former Egyptian Prime Minister Khan has previously made this suggestion to the British authorities, but was rejected by the British side, and ultimately resigned. The current Prime Minister Nahas's attitude towards this matter is still unknown.

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Haitong News Agency telegram) - Military correspondents from British newspapers and correspondents in Cairo mostly believe that Egypt is feeling the threat of enemy attack, but some also believe that Egypt is not yet in imminent danger. Firstly, Rommel's forces must travel a long distance before reaching Alexandria, and the difficulties of supply transport will increase accordingly. Secondly, fresh British forces have arrived from the Near East. Thirdly, several new American Curtiss P-40 Warhawk aircraft have arrived, which can pose a significant threat to the enemy's supply and communication lines through bombing. Fourthly, the British have made military preparations to prevent the enemy from encircling them from the south. Some also believe that the German army captured a large amount of military equipment and supplies when they occupied Tobruk, and that German artillery and tanks are superior to the British, so they can gain the upper hand if they attack.

### Fierce Battle for Sevastopol Reaches Final Stage; Two Red Army Regiments Land at Yalta; Fighting Continues Southeast of Kharkov

Lisbon, 24th (Allied News Agency telegram) - The Soviet-German battle for Sevastopol has reached its final stage. According to a Moscow dispatch on the 24th, the Soviet newspaper *Red Star* quoted frontline reports as saying that the German attacks on Sevastopol are becoming increasingly fierce. It is reported that the German army is gradually reinforcing its forces with tanks and fresh troops. To date, the German army has concentrated approximately twelve divisions on this front, and is using special mortars at close range to bombard the Soviet forces, forcing them to retreat in two directions. The battlefield is littered with countless corpses.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 25th (Havas News Agency telegram) - Two regiments of the Red Army, transported by ship from the Caucasus under the cover of warships, landed at the port of Yalta, south of Crimea, last night. Despite heavy coastal fire, the Red Army secured a foothold and advanced to several points behind the German lines. Fierce fighting broke out in the Karagach Pass area this morning. German forces in Kerch and Feodosia have rushed to that area to counterattack.

Stockholm, Switzerland, 26th (Havas News Agency telegram) - A correspondent from the *Journal de Genève* stationed in Berlin recently reported that the battle for Sevastopol has entered its final stage. Both sides are fiercely fighting around the shipyard. The Red Army is resisting to the end, willing to die with the port. All houses and public buildings have become small fortresses. The northern part of the shipyard has fallen into German hands, but it is buried with mines, causing constant explosions. In general, the city is full of "time bombs." The city has been almost completely destroyed and is devoid of everything. It is expected that when the city is completely occupied by the German army, the remaining houses will also be destroyed by artillery fire. The fighting in the south is particularly fierce, but the German-Italian forces are unlikely to achieve a decisive success in the shortest possible time, as the city is shielded by high mountains, making it difficult to completely occupy. German aircraft are constantly bombing the mountains, and the smoke obscures the sky, making it difficult for German troops to advance. Their efforts have taken on a "superhuman" character. In total, from the 7th to the 22nd of this month, the Red Army suffered heavy losses, with 11,000 captured and 158 artillery pieces lost. No less than 65,000 landmines were destroyed. In the central sector, the German army is continuing its mopping-up operations.

Moscow, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - The Red Army High Command recently issued a war report stating that the German army has again begun to attack in the Kharkov area. Although it has repeatedly attacked the port of Sevastopol, it has been repelled by our army. No major battles have occurred in other theaters of war. According to the Red Army newspaper *Red Star*, the German army attacked a certain point with 200 tanks, and the Red Army retreated locally, but the Red Army line was not breached.

Berlin, 25th (Havas News Agency telegram) - The German High Command announced today that the German army has launched an offensive southeast of Kharkov since the 22nd of this month in order to clear out the enemy in that area.

### German Aircraft Attack Britain

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Haitong News Agency telegram)

A dispatch from London stated that German aircraft were very active last night in eastern Britain and the Midlands, dropping many incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs.

### Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Returns Home for Consultation; Turkish Ambassador Postpones Return

Ankara, 25th (Haitong News Agency telegram)

Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov has been recalled to Moscow by the Soviet government to receive a report on the situation. He will be accompanied by the legal advisor of the Soviet embassy.

Istanbul, Turkey, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov is scheduled to leave here alone tomorrow to return to his country to report to the government. At the same time, it is reported that Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Aktai has also postponed his return to his post until August. The departure of one ambassador and the postponement of the other are seen by officials here as a sign of cooling relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, but bilateral relations are not expected to become tense as a result. As for the attempted assassination of German Ambassador von Papen, two Russian and two Yugoslav defendants have recently been sentenced by the Supreme Court. It is not yet known whether the trial will be reopened in order to continue gathering information about the case. Insiders say that the litigation and the political events it has triggered have not actually revealed the secrets behind the case, but it is reported that all four defendants have appealed.

### Spain's Delicate Position

Rome, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - Regarding the recent visit of Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer to Italy, sources say that any negotiations involving Spain acting as a mediator between the belligerent countries or Spain changing its current attitude towards either the Axis or the democratic countries are excluded. At the same time, the local newspapers are mostly confused about the sudden visit of Foreign Minister Suñer. They only say that Suñer had very cordial talks with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano. Some political figures have also strongly argued that the negotiations did not involve the promotion of a common foreign policy.

Vatican City, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - Pope Pius XII's health has gradually improved. He received Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer this morning for a long talk.

Algeciras, 25th (Haitong News Agency telegram) - The Governor of Gibraltar, Lieutenant General MacFarlane, visited General Barroso, the Spanish military commander of the area, on the Spanish border yesterday.

### Merchant Ship Attack Incident; Argentina Protests to Germany; Public Opinion Expresses Outrage at German Actions

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - Regarding the sinking of the Argentine merchant ship *Rio Tercero* by a German submarine, Foreign Minister Guani announced that the Argentine government has protested to the German authorities. Newspapers across the country have also unanimously expressed outrage. *La Nación* carried a statement from Foreign Minister Guani, in which he condemned the German actions and said that aggression of this nature is a violation of international treaties and is difficult to ignore. The newspaper commented, "Argentina's consistent policy is to respect international law. In this regard, our policy has never changed. Therefore, we must find ways to ensure that our rights are respected by other countries. This is what the whole country and the press hope for."

Axis Submarine Activity off Brazilian Coast

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - According to responsible sources, there may be an Axis submarine base off the coast of Maranhão Province in northern Brazil, approximately near Rio Curu. The Brazilian government, especially the air force, has taken all necessary steps to uncover this secret base.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - It was previously reported that an Axis submarine base was discovered off the coast of Maranhão Province in Brazil. According to recent reports, it is reported that Axis submarines are refueling near this coast. The Brazilian Navy and Air Force are currently conducting an investigation. The area is the delta of Rio Curu Province, at the junction of the former Maranhão and Para provinces. The range of activity of this base, from Natal in the south to French Guiana in the north, can intercept all merchant shipping traffic. Several submarine attacks on merchant ships have occurred in this area, and small merchant ships are secretly shuttling to supply supplies to the submarines. According to related sources here, the Brazilian coastline is very long, and it is not impossible for the Axis powers to establish a base, and the interior traffic is difficult, and the population is sparse, and it requires a well-planned plan to control it for a long time technically. If air force activities can be strengthened in the future, it will be easier to control.

Spanish Government Denies Supplying Axis Submarines

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) - Regarding the rumor that Spanish ships traveling between that country and South America have been supplying fuel to Axis submarines, the Spanish government has formally denied it. The Spanish Embassy here also issued a written statement to the various embassies yesterday, strongly stating that Spanish ships have not supplied Axis submarines. It is said that the fuel used by Spain comes entirely from the United States, and all sales and distribution matters are supervised by the US government representative in Spain. Therefore, even if a minimum amount of fuel were to be extracted after each ship was allocated fuel to supply Axis submarines, it would not be possible.

All Ships Along Swedish Coast Must Participate in Convoy

### Nine, Iraq: Past and Present (1)

Ancient Civilization

Around 3000 BC, the Sumerians settled in the area between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in Asia Minor. They utilized the waters of the two rivers for irrigation, developing the earliest agricultural civilization. They also invented cuneiform writing, the lunar calendar, the sexagesimal system, sun-dried mud bricks, and more. After 1842, European and American archaeologists successively excavated ancient architectural remains in the desolate mounds of these two major river valleys. Consequently, an ancient culture forgotten for over two thousand years was rediscovered by the world. This also added a new field to European and American archaeology (Assyriology) for specialized academic research, significantly expanding the world's cultural history. This is what is now widely known as Babylonian culture.

Babylonian culture originated in the Euphrates and Tigris river valleys, much like the ancient Chinese culture originated in the Yellow River valley, and the ancient Egyptian culture in the Nile River valley. The most valuable aspects of Babylonian culture for modern civilization to emulate and learn from are astronomy and law.

The Sumerians highly valued astrology, believing that the stars controlled human destiny. Observing celestial phenomena became a priority for the Sumerians. They were able to predict solar and lunar eclipses. To facilitate astronomical observation, they divided the circle into 360 degrees, each degree into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds. This system is still used by astronomers worldwide today. They also divided the ecliptic into twelve zodiac signs, with the five planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) each ruling two signs, and the Sun and Moon each ruling one sign, governing human fortune and misfortune. They used the lunar cycle as a month and twelve months as a year, which became the lunar calendar of later generations. They also invented sundials and water clocks. Sundials were used to calculate daytime hours, and water clocks to calculate nighttime hours. Both daytime and nighttime were divided into twelve hours, each hour further divided into sixty minutes, which is still used worldwide today. This division of the circle, the ecliptic, and the hours of day and night are distinctive features of the Sumerian numerical system and became the foundation for later astronomy.

Speaking of Babylonian law, it is also remarkable. Recently, European archaeologists discovered a stone tablet in Susa, inscribed with the Code of Hammurabi, the Babylonian king. It contains 282 articles, roughly categorized into miscellaneous laws, fugitive slaves, robbery, leases, agriculture, irrigation canals, trade, debts, family matters, divorce, property, adopted children, rewards, physicians, veterinarians, branding slaves, builders, ships, shepherds, field rentals, wages, and slave purchases. It covers civil law, criminal law, property rights, inheritance law, and more. This shows that society four thousand years ago already had such a brilliant legal code. However, the sections on fugitive slaves, branded slaves, and slave purchases all concern slaves. This indicates that the social conditions at that time involved a vast difference between free people and slaves, as slaves were regarded as equal to property and livestock.

Natural Environment

Iraq is located in southeastern Asia Minor, bordering the Persian Gulf to the south, facing the Indian Ocean. It is separated from the Mediterranean Sea by Syria, bordered by Saudi Arabia to the west, and Turkey and Iran to the north. The Euphrates and Tigris rivers run through it, forming the large Mesopotamian Plain. The area is 3,250 square miles, and the total population is over 3.3 million.

The Tigris and Euphrates rivers both originate in the Armenian highlands and flow southeast into the Persian Gulf. The Euphrates River is the largest river in western Asia, with a total length of 1,825 miles. Steamships can travel upstream from the river mouth to Birecik. The Tigris River is 1,070 miles long. Boats can navigate up to Baghdad, 560 miles upstream. The two rivers often flood, creating fertile land with rich soil and abundant products. Hence, this place has been known as the "Garden of the World" since ancient times. The lower reaches of the two rivers converge and enter the Persian Gulf, with the confluence being called the Shatt al-Arab River. The river mouth is prone to siltation, with an average of seventy acres of sediment deposited annually in the Persian Gulf. This sedimentation is quite significant, which is a drawback.

Originally, western Asia was surrounded by water on all sides: the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf to the southeast, the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea to the west, and the Black Sea and Caspian Sea to the north. The northern part is mountainous, and the southern part is desert. Only the central semicircular area, extending from the Persian Gulf in the east to the Mediterranean coast in the west, has the Euphrates and Tigris rivers flowing through it, forming a crescent shape of fertile land, also known as the "Fertile Crescent." Iraq is located at the eastern end of this Fertile Crescent. Its climate is warm in winter but extremely hot in summer, so epidemics often occur.

World's Fifth Largest Oil Producer

Iraq is located in the Mesopotamian Plain, where the Sumerians developed agricultural civilization since ancient times. Therefore, agricultural products are quite abundant, and animal husbandry is also well-developed. In this century, oil resources have been regarded as the resource of all resources. Because Iraq has large oil fields, it has attracted the attention of European powers, and there is even the possibility of a fierce battle for oil resources.

Iraq's oil reserves are generally estimated to account for more than 10% of the world's oil production. In 1936, the oil production was more than 4.27 million tons, and in 1939, it was more than 4.13 million tons. The largest oil producer in the world is the United States, followed by the Soviet Union, Venezuela, and Romania. Iraq ranks fifth.

### After the Completion of the French Concession's Baojia System, Plans are Underway to Distribute Daily Necessities According to Population; Accurate Census Can Prevent Unequal Distribution; the Self-Defense Corps is Being Organized; 600,000 Citizen Certificates for Residents Aged Seven and Above are Being Reissued.

At 5 p.m. on the 24th of this month, the Central Baojia Preparatory Committee of the French Concession and its sub-committees held a meeting at the Police Headquarters. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Faber (representing the French Consul-General), Deputy Chairman Father Mu (Director of the French Municipal Council), and Mr. Liu Xingsun, elected by the Chinese members. Attendees included Chinese members Ge Weifan, Yu Yongsui, Zhang Renzhong, Yu Jing, Zhang Shanxian, Wu Zhesheng, and sub-committee members Xu Jingfu, Liu Chenglin, Wang Shulin, Lei Dunzhi, Chen Fukang, Ding Sheng, Wang Litang, Li Mingfu, Yue Yucheng, Gu Ziheng, Fan Yonglian, Yao Yizhang, Huang Dinghu, Jin Zaisheng, Shen Weizhen, Sang Wenhui, Lu Qi, and others. At the beginning of the meeting, it was announced that the French Consul-General had appointed Mr. Saver, the Director of the Finance Department of the French Municipal Council, as the accounting director of the Baojia Office.

Faber's Speech

Subsequently, Faber delivered the following speech: "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your efforts and tireless assistance in the organization of the Baojia system in the French Concession. I would like to express my gratitude to all of you today. The Baojia system has existed in China since ancient times. Chinese culture has a long history, and almost every new system has been implemented. However, the organization of Baojia in this city during these difficult times is indeed a new product, and I believe it will have good results. I have been in China for twenty years, and in Shanghai, as in Tianjin, I have always strived to promote the happiness of the residents. I believe that my unaspiring efforts will have good results because our work, no matter what, will certainly have results. It will closely link the authorities and residents, unite them in purpose, create sincere cooperation, and eliminate all misunderstandings. In a few weeks, once the census is completed, deaths and births are registered, and everyone has an identity card, criminal cases will almost disappear from the police's view, and bad elements will have no way to live in the Concession without being discovered. In terms of hygiene, the most harmful epidemics in Shanghai will not be difficult to effectively prevent. Moreover, the supply of food will have even better results. Therefore, all daily necessities can be easily distributed according to population, and there will be no inequality. In the past, we asked you to give us complete and sincere cooperation, and you have done so. On our side, we can also guarantee to you that you will not be subject to any restrictions and can absolutely rely on us. If we occasionally make mistakes, and you feel that our ideals do not match yours, please tell us frankly in a friendly manner because only a friendly attitude can enable us to fully cooperate to benefit the residents. I, in my capacity as the French Consul-General, would like to thank Father Mu and Mr. Liu Xingsun for accepting the nomination as vice-chairmen, and all the Chinese members present for sacrificing their personal work to come and assist. I am deeply grateful. In addition, I am deeply grateful for the financial donations from the residents of the Concession for this vast organization we are carrying out. Finally, I would also like to thank all the preparatory committee members who, under the guidance of Mr. Sarre, have been working tirelessly on the preparations for the Baojia system for several weeks. Judging from the mutual trust and the determination of everyone at today's meeting, I believe that the organization of the Baojia system will have satisfactory results."

Overview of Baojia Work

Subsequently, Mr. Sarre, Deputy Director of the French Police, gave a brief speech outlining the work of organizing the Baojia system in the French Concession over the past month. The French Concession has 246 sections, divided into 854 bao, 3,976 jia, and 30,392 households. The total population within the Baojia system is 746,207 people. A total of 165,200 guarantee forms and 301,000 household registration forms have been filled out by the Baojia heads. To facilitate the issuance of rice purchase certificates, the police have issued thousands of special certificates to replace housing tax receipts. As for future plans, citizen certificates (with photos) will be issued to residents aged seven and above, requiring approximately 600,000 certificates. At the same time, plans are being made to organize a self-defense corps. The items needed for the corps are being procured, and all guard posts, alarm bells, and street phones are being manufactured and installed. Afterwards, the attendees exchanged opinions and discussed ways to improve the system, aiming to benefit the residents. Before the meeting adjourned, it was resolved that meetings would continue to be held every Monday at the French Police Headquarters.

### Young Man Gathers a Gang to Specialize in Kidnapping Women; the French Police Arrest Six Men and Eleven Women and Confiscate a Live-Ammunition Handgun.

Wu Kaifu, a 21-year-old man from Nanjing, specializes in luring women from good families into illicit relationships and then selling them for profit. He usually dresses lavishly, like a wealthy young man. On the 18th of this month, the Dragon Boat Festival, Wu thought that public places would be full of well-dressed, beautiful women and young girls, so with a little skill, he would be able to trap them. Therefore, he changed into new clothes and went to the Rue Edward VII to dance and watch a play. Wu was seated next to Li Cuiying, a young girl from Ningbo (17 years old). Her father ran a tobacco and paper shop near Zhou Shan Road on Huade Road in Hongkou. That day, she had dressed up to celebrate the festival and also went to the dance hall to watch the play. Wu saw that the girl was beautiful, so he showered her with attention, using his hunting skills. The girl was indeed charmed and was taken to Room 88 of the Anshang Hotel on Bali Bridge Street. After five nights of continuous sexual intercourse, Wu was planning to sell her to another place for a large sum of money. Unexpectedly, his plan was discovered by French police detectives Xia Guoxiang, Shen Lianfang, and Zhao Hengqing, who rushed to the hotel at 9:30 p.m. the night before, arrested Wu, and rescued Li. They were taken to the police station together. Subsequently, they waited for his accomplices in the same room and arrested five more men and two women, and confiscated a live-ammunition handgun. Due to the seriousness of the case, the police are conducting a strict interrogation.

### Shanghai Dance Hall Murder; the Owner is Questioned

In the case where Lou Minwei, a dance hostess manager, and Xue Lin, an inspector, of the Shanghai Dance Hall on Guangdong Road, gathered a crowd to beat to death Chen Yunlai, a dance guest, and injure Lin Siqing, etc., Xue stated in court that the dance hall owner, Tang Mingde, offered him 10,000 yuan after the incident to admit that he was the main culprit in the case. On the day of the incident, Tang was also present and did not stop or discourage the violence. Therefore, it was believed that Tang also had considerable responsibility and should be summoned for questioning. A subpoena was issued and Tang was summoned yesterday for questioning. However, Tang firmly denied the statements made by Xue, claiming that he was not present at the time. Although quarrels and fights between dance guests in the dance hall due to jealousy often occurred, the fact that dance hall staff gathered a crowd of dance guests to commit violence, resulting in four injuries and one death, meant that the dance hall owner could not evade some responsibility. He was ordered to leave temporarily pending a decision.

### Moufu Steamer Plans to Sail the Shanghai-Hankou Route

The Moufu Steamer (i.e., the Xin Ningshao of the Ning Shao Shipping Company) had been detained on Zhoushan Island for a year and a half. After being dredged, it was released in the middle of last month and returned to Shanghai, mooring at buoy numbers 27 and 28. It was then repaired. Mr. Chen from the mountain area was very busy negotiating the resumption of navigation. It is heard that he recently went to Japan again. After returning to Shanghai last week, he went to Ningbo again at the beginning of this week to negotiate. Everything in Shanghai and other places is already in sight. It is tentatively planned to sail at the beginning of next month, and there is talk of sailing the Shanghai-Hankou route. However, it is difficult to predict whether it can be implemented as scheduled. The German Far Eastern Navigation Company's Hana Steamer has a rumor of renting the China Shipping Company to sail from Shenjiamen. The leasing issue is still under negotiation. The departure date is still far away.

### First Batch of Citizen Certificates in the Laozha District Have Also Begun to Be Issued

Citizen Certificates for the Self-Defense Corps Have Not Been Issued

According to reports from the Datong News Agency, the first batches of Public Concession citizen certificates have been issued in the New Gate District, Central District, and Chengdu District. The Laozha District has also begun issuing the first batch of citizen certificates. As for the citizen certificates for members of the Self-Defense Corps, because their format is different from ordinary citizen certificates and they are given certain conveniences in transportation, they have not yet been issued.

### Impersonating Company Workmen to Steal Water Meters

Chen Chunyou, a native of Shaoxing residing at No. 2, Deli Lane, Kangti Road, colluded with Xu Acheng, a native of Wuxi, on the afternoon of the previous day to impersonate French Water and Electricity Company workmen, carrying iron pipes, to open the water pool cover at the back door of No. 43, Bugao Lane, 589 Route Baron Gros, in an attempt to steal water meter parts. They were discovered and intercepted by the lane manager. Detectives Zhang Daorong, Wang Yuncai, and Sun Liting of the French Police happened to be passing by and arrested Chen and Xu and brought them to the police station. After questioning, the police head found that the defendants had committed crimes more than once and ordered them to be detained for further investigation.

### Speculators Fined 10,000 Yuan; the Shanghai Municipal Council Strictly Prohibits and Investigates

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued an announcement to crack down on speculation, stating: "In accordance with the Exchange Law promulgated by the Chinese government, any person or legal entity under the jurisdiction of Chinese law who sells or speculates in goods, securities, warehouse receipts, or bills of lading without the approval of the competent authority shall be fined 10,000 yuan or imprisoned upon conviction. The Council hereby announces that any person or legal entity under Chinese law within the Public Concession who violates the aforementioned trading laws shall be strictly investigated by the Council. Violators not subject to Chinese law shall be subject to appropriate punishment by the Council."

### Broadcast by the Director of the French Municipal Council's Health Department: the Epidemic Prevention Situation in the French Concession

Dr. Balu, Director of the Health Department of the French Municipal Council, gave a broadcast speech at the French Cultural Center here yesterday, reporting on the epidemic prevention situation in the French Concession, stating that cholera epidemics are cyclical, occurring approximately every five years.

Occurring Every Five Years

The cholera outbreaks in Shanghai were most severe in 1900, 1912, and 1916. After 1916, the number of cases decreased significantly as a result of strict epidemic prevention. This situation lasted until 1933, when cholera broke out again in Shanghai. After the authorities took strict preventive measures, the epidemic was not only suppressed but also did not recur until 1936. It was hoped that 1936 would be peaceful, but the Sino-Japanese War suddenly broke out in that year, and the situation changed greatly. Refugees from the suburbs of Shanghai flocked to the concessions, and the occurrence of cholera was inevitable. The epidemic broke out at the end of August and reached its peak in mid-September. At that time, 2,880 cases of cholera were discovered, but refugees often hid their illness, so the actual number of patients was much higher. The scope of transmission was very wide.

Vaccination Campaign

Therefore, the epidemic broke out again in 1938, with 11,233 cases and 2,110 deaths. The authorities continued to take emergency measures, especially focusing on vaccination, because most of the infected people were unvaccinated refugees. This vaccination campaign broke all records, using a total of 2.5 million cubic centimeters of vaccine, with as many as 34,400 injections given per day. Subsequently, in 1939 and 1941, cholera recurred every summer, but the scope was very small, only about 300 cases. This is a great achievement, especially in the case of imperfect sanitary conditions. Advancing epidemic prevention is especially commendable.

Preventive Measures

In January 1939, 4,000 corpses of children were collected from the streets. From this one point, one can see the rest. Dr. Balu finally discussed the situations of direct and indirect infection, as well as preventive measures, especially emphasizing the need to carefully select fruits and vegetables, eradicate flies, and get vaccinated. As for tap water, it is constantly inspected by the health authorities and will never contain germs. Residents of the Concession can rest assured.

### Exhibitions Require Written Permission

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued an announcement stating that no exhibition of goods, antiques, or works of art is allowed in the Public Concession without obtaining written permission from the Council.

### Workers' Technical Night School To Promote Industrial Education, Expand Organization and Add Electrical Engineering Class Next Semester, Recruiting New Students

Ms. Xing De, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial and Social Affairs Department, recently told our reporter that the Workers' Technical Night School, established by the department to promote industrial education and cultivate specialized skills, has successfully concluded this semester. The next semester is scheduled to begin in early September. In addition to the original Mechanical Technology Specialization, a new Electrical Technology Specialization will be added. The two departments will jointly recruit a total of 290 new students and transfer students of all grades. Technicians, workers, or apprentices who have completed their apprenticeships in machine and iron factories, machine repair shops, electrical manufacturing plants, electrical installation companies, and other mechanical and electrical plants are all welcome to apply for the entrance examination. The application period is from now until August 17th. The location is the main office of the school at No. 209 Jiangxi Road, Industrial and Social Affairs Department. The main purpose of establishing the school is to encourage workers to engage in specialized technical training in the evenings. Therefore, each student only needs to pay a fee of 5 yuan per semester.

Imparting Specialized Technical Knowledge

According to Ms. Xing De, the establishment of the school aims to train technicians or apprentices who have not received advanced education but have practical factory experience, providing them with more theoretical technical knowledge to compensate for their lack of experience and correct historical technical errors, thereby improving factory work efficiency, improving product quality, avoiding waste, and reducing industrial disasters. Four or five years ago, the Industrial and Social Affairs Department established a "Safety Class" specifically to train factory boiler stokers and foremen, providing them with short-term education for six to eight weeks to enable them to understand the scientific management of boilers and machines to prevent disasters and ensure safety. More than 500 stokers and 300-400 foremen graduated, and their work in various places has been highly praised by the industrial community.

East and West Schools Train Separately

The Workers' Technical Night School gradually evolved from this type of short-term training class. It officially opened on September 1st last autumn, with a total of more than 200 students, all of whom were skilled workers from machine factories. The school site is divided into two locations: the East District is located at No. 100 Jingzhou Road, Hongkou, within the Shanghai Municipal Council's Jingzhou Primary School, and the West District is located at No. 25 Mabai Road, within the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Children's Public School. The subjects in both locations are limited to mechanics, with one second-year class and four first-year classes. When the Shanghai environment changed last December, the number of students did not decrease significantly. At the end of the semester, 23 students were awarded for excellent results and 41 were awarded for perfect attendance. The second semester began in February of this year, and the number of students did not decrease from the past. The East School has already closed for the summer break the day before yesterday, and the West School will also have a holiday at the beginning of next month. (To be continued)

This is truly a great loss to the country, and I feel infinite emotion in my heart.

### Public Bond Red Tickets Still Difficult to Resolve Market Stable with Fatigue

The over-the-counter market for public bonds was up for the third day yesterday, but the upward momentum finally felt weak. For example, Type C once rose to 40 yuan and 4 jiao, but then fell back to 39 yuan and 6 jiao. At the close, the bulls tried their best to pull up, barely closing above 40 yuan. Type A had no increase or decrease at all. There were also few buyers for Type D, which had the lowest price. The market showed signs of rising with fatigue. The most difficult to resolve is the red ticket that has already been drawn but has not been redeemed. When exchanging, no one accepts it. When selling, even if the black market price is reduced by one or two yuan, no one accepts it. Now, according to the regulations, both Types D and E have also been drawn, but their numbers have not yet been announced in the newspapers. Once they are announced, those who hold spot goods of Types D and E may at any time find themselves in a situation where the red tickets are not accepted. The next problem is the coupon issue. Currently, acceptance and delivery are based on the only condition of carrying last year's 12th period coupon. However, when the 13th period coupon expires at the end of July, it will be difficult to expedite the 12th period coupon as a delivery condition. This will inevitably be a major dispute among the industry. Therefore, even those who hold goods are uneasy, so there are now some who are selling, such as Tongli, Tongkang, Lianyi, Xinji, Runli, Runde, and Hu Heji are all selling. Only Wuhe, Hongxing, Zhenhua, Yitai, and Shuntai are buying. As a result, Type A was flat, and the rest rose by 2 jiao to 5 jiao. Turnover was approximately 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### There are Rumors of China Textile Issuing Refunds

Yesterday, foreign shares showed a slight softness. Ewo Cotton Mill was offered at 42 yuan and 5 jiao with no demand. Shin Ho at 37 yuan, and both Shanghai Brewery and Paper Industry were quoted at 13 yuan by sellers. The rumors of China Textile issuing refunds are still strong. There are still buyers at 39 yuan. Steel Industry at 17 yuan and Woolen at 16 yuan also have buyers. The remaining prices were not heard quoted.

### Chinese Stocks Squeezed Slightly

Yesterday, Chinese stocks turned from fatigue to stability with rare turnover. Prices mostly squeezed slightly higher. The following is a further breakdown: Category Highest Lowest Last New Asia New China French New Minsheng Innerwear Wing On Sincere Commercial China World One Nanyang Tobacco Great China Zhabei Electric Shanghai Chinese Electric

### Taking Small Doses and Spitting Out After Continuous Rises Piece Goods Maintain a Balanced Situation

Factory Cloth The cloth market yesterday was unable to rise, and still did not escape the situation of hovering. Quotes were only slightly different, and transactions were also rare. 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth 190 yuan Flying Goose 185 yuan, 9-pound New Character 115 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 112 yuan, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth 168 yuan, Fugu 161 yuan, Fugu Fine Material 140 yuan, Peach Blossom Woman Lin saw a high of 175 yuan and 5 jiao, a low of 171 yuan, and closed in the evening at 174 yuan and 5 jiao. Magnolia Bleached Cloth 165 yuan, Tailiang Yu 160 yuan, Longevity Palace Silk 6 yuan, Jasper Book Fragrance 5 yuan and 7 jiao, Volleyball Gauze Palace Silk 4 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, Chick Holland 267 yuan, and An'an Blue Cloth 182 yuan. The situation is stable.

Eastern Cloth Initially fell and then recovered, because a small number of people absorbed it. If it rises continuously, some people will spit it out, and it has become a situation of maintaining balance. The new single morning opening for 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth was 188 yuan, and then gradually rose to 196 yuan and a half. The afternoon closing was 195 yuan and 5 jiao, which was 5 jiao higher than the previous day. Caiqiu Fine Cloth was 174 yuan, which increased by 3 yuan. Yanghe was 165 yuan, and Trumpet was 164 yuan. Prices are still stable. The Red Single of the Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 7 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, with the highest price being 7 yuan, 3 jiao and 8 fen. The afternoon closing was 7 yuan, 3 jiao and 5 fen.

### Decline in Woolen Consumption

Yesterday, the woolen market atmosphere was still firm. Most goods were priced higher. Meifeng Overcoat Wool was sold for 400 yuan, Golden Bear Brand Rainproof Cloth was 27 yuan, Orangutan Tai was 25 yuan, Fair Soft Lining was 8 yuan and a half, Baoxin Linen Cloth was 11 yuan and a half, Hunterson Grey Willow Tweed was 160 yuan, 129 Feather Gauze Tweed was 140 yuan, 456 Thin Tweed was 100 yuan, 135 Spring Tweed was 180 yuan, 250 Camel Silk was 260 yuan, 1 to 28 Cavalry Breeches were 270-280 yuan, and 128 Green Serge was 150-160 yuan. The price of our factory's suit tweed is 200 yuan to 280 yuan per yard, and imported goods are sold for 250 yuan to 400 yuan. Digestion continues to decline. Because prices continue to rise wildly, actual sales have greatly declined, and trading is also lacking.

### Reduced Trade in Beans

Yesterday's trade in beans continued to decrease. This was because transportation permits could not be issued smoothly, so both supply and demand were in a sluggish mood. Red beans and green beans both fell by 5-6 yuan due to the loosening of floating households. Soybeans lacked transactions. It is estimated that 30 packages of Chongming Sand Red were traded at a price of 163 yuan, and 160 packages of Sand Green were traded at a price of 123 yuan.

### Bean Cake Still Idle

The trade in bean cake is still idle. Domestic sales are still not smooth. Only floating households have some acceptance. Old goods are said to be stable. New goods have fallen by another 2-3 yuan. It is estimated that 300 pieces of Hankou old cake were priced at 43 yuan and a half. 500 pieces of the Lizi Cake May warehouse receipt were priced at 53 yuan to 53 yuan and a half. 500 pieces of the Shenji Cake June old warehouse receipt were priced at 47 yuan, and 500 pieces of the July old warehouse receipt were priced at 50 yuan. 1,000 pieces of the April new warehouse receipt were priced at 54 yuan to 53 yuan.

### Bran Slightly Embellished

The corn market situation was initially tired and then firm. Initially, the price fell due to scattered households selling at a discount. Then, the sales turned to brisk, and the result was similar to before. Yesterday, 530 packages of Wuhu Corn were opened at a price of 118 yuan to 125 yuan. 3 trucks of Chuzhou Corn were priced at 120 yuan.

The retail sales of bran in the vicinity are still slightly embellished, and the market situation continues to be stable. It is estimated that 300 packages of Peony small package bran were priced at 88 yuan. 500 packages of Sanxin small package bran, the warehouse receipt price on April 22 was 87 yuan and a half, and the warehouse receipt on April 26 was 88 yuan.

### Sugar is Rumored to Increase, Sugar Stocks Suddenly Rise

According to the Cooperation Office, there is a possibility of increasing the price of sugar distributed to retailers this month. Therefore, the sugar stock market suddenly tightened, and transactions increased. The raw sugar stock market was still bullish at the beginning, opening at 306 yuan. Then, due to more buyers, it continued to rise to 309 yuan, and the closing even reached 313 yuan, a rise of 8 yuan before and after. The red sugar stock opened at 295 yuan and reached the 300 yuan mark, also rising by 7 yuan.

### More Demand than Supply, Straits Tin Becomes More Expensive

The supply of 20-gauge and 26-gauge Straits Tin circulating on the market is drying up and will soon be exhausted. However, inquiries have been very enthusiastic in recent days, resulting in an extremely heated market and an unparalleled sense of firm pricing. The only outlet for this product is currently for yarn factories in this street to use to manufacture rollers. The sales of lock factories and machine factories have temporarily stopped. However, the number of sheets purchased by small hardware stores is also very lively. Therefore, those who hold goods are in a high mood and are unwilling to easily sell. As a result, the standard has risen again and again and has broken through the 100 yuan mark per sheet. Yesterday, such as 24-gauge goods were sold for 120 yuan per sheet, and 26-gauge patterns were sold for about 100 yuan per sheet. The transaction of cases and boxes is almost non-existent. In addition, each shipment of Straits Tin is sold for 1,100 yuan, each case of double shipment of Straits Tin is 2,200 yuan, each case of US Company Tin is 1,800 yuan, and each case of Narrow Strip Iron is 1,400 yuan.

### Jinshan Branches are Scarce and Prices Rise

Jinshan branches are becoming scarce because new goods still need time, and the existing stock of old goods is decreasing, so the trend has turned tighter. Yesterday, the price of Jinshan yuan branches was called up by 100 yuan. The stock of flat branches is about to be exhausted, and the market is also tight. A few dozen boxes of Shuidong flat branches are still being baked and will be sold before they are finished because the cost is relatively high. It is difficult to guarantee the cost of sales at this time, so it is planned to sell well when the new and old are not connected, or it can be seen rising.

### Preserved Plums Open at Tight Prices

Preserved plums are not arriving much, and merchants are unwilling to loosen prices. It was previously seen at 300 yuan. Recently, dozens of packages were reopened at 320 yuan. Now there are even those calling for 350 yuan. This item is difficult to transport on the way, and although it is a rough product, the market situation is difficult to return to normal. Therefore, although the demand from northern merchants is rare, there is no hope of loosening.

### Quiet Cigarette Market

The cigarette market is roundabout. Although the sales of customers are still not lonely, the general speculators are still tired and unable to rise. The industry's demand is not smooth. The market yesterday was tired, such as the British brand, with a price of 8,500 yuan. Old Knife brand 5,350 yuan, Pinhai brand 4,500 yuan, Wuhua brand 3,850 yuan, Fairy brand 4,000 yuan, Japanese cigarette Jinqiang brand 1,500 yuan, Jin Dalou brand 2,250 yuan, Red Rose brand 1,350 yuan, Quanlu brand 2,000 yuan, Nianzhi Quanlu brand 2,020 yuan, Compass brand 1,450 yuan, National cigarette Jinshu brand 1,980 yuan, and Meili brand 3,400 yuan, all were quiet.

### Daily Necessities Unstable

In the daily necessities market, the price of soap is falling more and more fiercely. Under the rumor of interest, there are few buyers, and the atmosphere is becoming more and more scornful. It is estimated that the opening price of Guben soap has dropped to 300 yuan per box, Baixiang Mao soap is 240 yuan, Jian Dao soap is 290 yuan, and Huangxiang Mao soap is 200 yuan, all falling by more than 20 yuan. The sharpness of the rise and the speed of the fall can be seen in the state of the market. It is estimated that Phoenix brand matches are 3,100 yuan, Meili brand is 3,200 yuan, miscellaneous brands are 2,300 yuan, White Li's foreign candles are 130 yuan, and Monk Hat brand is 125 yuan, all in a soft trend.

### Self-Reporting

— Jin Yi

The authorities of the two concessions have imposed fines and suspensions on many stores that do not comply with the regulation of "using the selling price from the 25th to the 28th of last month as the conversion to the new currency," which is a great relief. However, the stores that have been punished still blame the "black market," and the stores that have not yet been reported are still watching, which is still worth noting. Because many stores have cancelled the marked prices, and some have even destroyed their account books, thinking that there is no way to trace the origin, they can luckily escape the net; in fact, it is not necessary to rely on strong evidence, and it can be seen through this technique with common sense. For example, a certain shirt now sells for 35 yuan in new currency. May I ask if the highest price of this shirt used to be 70 yuan in old currency? Also, for example, haircuts, the "listed price" is now between 4 yuan and 5 yuan in new currency. May I ask if the highest price for a haircut used to be 8 yuan and 10 yuan in old currency? These are examples that can be picked up at will, and others can be inferred from this. Therefore, who is right and who is wrong, there is no need to blame or be clever. For the sake of respecting commercial ethics and reputation, it is better to self-report than to wait for the punishment of the authorities. For example, yesterday a certain shirt company automatically cancelled the new selling price that was ordered on June 5th. I think this attitude of "knowing the mistake and correcting it" is worth emulating.

Blame, who created the "black market"; clever, only to deceive the common people, I hope everyone will self-report, so as not to publish "obligatory advertisements" in the news column.

### Handshake

— Wu Han

There are many things that can be laughed at on the street, as long as you look at them coldly and do not have any other fantasies in your heart. One day, I stood at the window on the second floor, browsing the street scene and killing time. Fortunately, I don't make Double Horse Factory orders, and I don't buy US tickets or Hong Kong dollars. A minute or a quarter of an hour, listening to her gently tiptoeing past, is all the same to me. Suddenly, two men appeared on the sidewalk across the street. One was wearing a white serge suit and a soft straw hat; the other was wearing a gray Western-style suit and a pith helmet on his forehead. He seemed to be older. I don't know the honorable surnames and fairy villages of these two gentlemen. Fortunately, they are all "pedestrians" on the street, so I will call them Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang.

At first, Mr. Wang went from north to south, and Mr. Zhang rushed towards him. If the two of them really collided, wouldn't they make a scene? Fortunately, between "close at hand," Mr. Zhang, who was wearing a gray Western-style suit, seemed to be more mature and prudent, and suddenly "braked." So, like two machines, running with the same horsepower, they started doing the same work: first, everyone's face showed the surprise of "unexpected encounter, joy beyond expectation"... sighs... absent-mindedness... etc. The second step was that everyone stood still and did not move, and very quickly, a soft straw hat and a pith helmet were simultaneously "unloaded" from their owner's heads. At this time, everyone held their hats in their right hands, but were busy talking. After a series of polite remarks such as "long time no see" or "what a fortunate encounter," suddenly both hats were switched to the left hand, and the right hands were freed, like magnets attracting iron, and shook hands.

This really stunned me. Their two hands were not only tightly clasped, but also vigorously shaken. After every four or five sentences, they shook it greatly. Such movements rose and fell, sometimes tense, sometimes relaxed, for about four times before the two hands remained in their original position and remained still for a minute or two. But they were still holding hands.

Because they were standing on the sidewalk facing the street, there were many pedestrians coming and going. Everyone felt it was inconvenient to bump into people, so they walked two or three steps towards the inside hand in hand. Perhaps Mr. Zhang wanted to ask Mr. Wang's address, or the place where he "made a fortune," Mr. Wang had to let go of his right hand that was holding Mr. Zhang, and took out a card from his pocket and gave it to Mr. Zhang. I don't know if the title of "Honorary Appointment" was engraved on the card, or if there were more words such as manager, associate manager, or chief of section. While Mr. Zhang looked at the business card, he stretched out his right hand again and shook hands with Mr. Wang. If the first handshake was a salute, then this second one must be a congratulation. Although the time was far less than the first time, it still shook twice in the middle before everyone let go. Finally, I felt a little bored, and yawned. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang had disappeared.

### Regarding the Rejection of "Supplementary Currency Notes"

— Yi Qing

The cost of living seems to be rising like a thermometer in the sun, rising, rising. Almost everything is denominated in yuan, even rickshaw pullers start asking for one yuan or more. Supplementary currency notes are simply of little use anywhere. Except perhaps on trams. Frankly, although tram fares are also constantly increasing, taking out a two-jiao supplementary currency note can still get you a few minutes of ride.

Precisely because trams are where supplementary currency notes are concentrated, a problem arises: ticket sellers refuse to accept any supplementary currency notes other than those issued by the "Central Reserve Bank."

Although the authorities have repeatedly issued explicit orders stating that the five-jiao and smaller supplementary currency notes of the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank are still in circulation, yesterday's newspapers also carried such reports: "...It is a mistake for the public to reject supplementary currency notes, because although the issue of Central Reserve jiao notes is large, it is still not enough to circulate freely in the market. Therefore, old supplementary currency notes, including those issued by the Central Agricultural Bank, are still tools for market transactions. Ticket sellers on public transportation should not discriminate against them, which affects public sentiment."

In theory, supplementary currency notes other than those of the "Central Reserve Bank" should be able to circulate freely. In reality, however, they are still rejected everywhere, especially on trams. When you take out a "Central Bank" or "China Bank" (not to mention "Central Agricultural Bank") supplementary currency note to pay the ticket seller, they politely ask you to exchange it. Otherwise, they will point to the notice posted in the tram that reads, "This company has refused to accept any bank notes other than Central Reserve notes since the 22nd," and say, "See?"

Under such circumstances, who would dare to accept anything other than the "Central Reserve Bank" supplementary currency notes, considering the existing ones worthless? The so-called "mistake" of the public rejecting supplementary currency notes is not really the fault of the public. To say it is the "discrimination" of the ticket sellers is also too harsh; one cannot violate the "notice"!

To eliminate the public's "mistake" or prevent the ticket sellers from "discriminating," the "notice" in the tram should be torn down as soon as possible, so that supplementary currency notes other than those of the "Central Reserve Bank" can hopefully still be "tools for market transactions."

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(6) In a Snap of Fingers

What Mrs. Ye the Second delighted in was that Wei Cheng did not approve of any of the potential daughters-in-law she had observed. What she delighted in was that among the people Wei Cheng kept close, there were none better than Cui Zhen and Guo Fang, or who combined the strengths of both. So she smiled and said, "Child, tell me, who else do you see that you have no criticism of at all?" Wei Cheng said, "No one." Mrs. Ye the Second said, "You should say, it's not time to tell me yet, don't say there isn't anyone. Saying there isn't anyone is like scolding your aunt. Good, let's put this matter aside and bring it up slowly, because to see whether a girl is good or bad, it takes a year and a half to find out." Mrs. Ye the Second thought she had judged correctly and went out. Wei Cheng held his head and thought, shaking his head, feeling that what he had said to his aunt was wrong. His aunt was saying how good Guo Fang was, and he should have followed her tone and said good; even if he didn't say good, he should at least not object. How could he fabricate something and say that Guo Fang had no mother's teaching, now leaving his aunt in a fog? Wei Cheng regretted it incessantly, opened the two bright tile windows in the bedroom, and stared blankly out the window.

Outside the window was a small courtyard. Because few people walked around on the steps, moss had grown. In the corner of the wall were three or four tile pots, growing morning glories, cacti, and wild roses on their own, but only one pomegranate tree, blooming with a bright red flower. Wei Cheng suddenly entrusted all his emotions to that flower, nodding his head in admiration. Joyful, not knowing when she had arrived in Wei Cheng's room, Wei Cheng had been focusing his gaze on the outside of the window. Accidentally, his gaze returned to the room, seeing a pair of blue cloth shoes and half-leg socks on the floor. Joyful called out, "Young Master!" Wei Cheng was startled and asked, "Quietly, what are you doing coming in here?" Joyful laughed and said, "Just now the Second Madam was in the Young Master's room for a long time, what did she say?" Wei Cheng said, "What do you care what she said?" Joyful quickly moved her feet and walked outside. Wei Cheng called her to stop and said, "Who told you to come and ask?" Joyful stood outside the door and turned her head, smiling, "No one told me to come and ask. Miss Cui Zhen, she didn't tell me to come and ask either." Joyful used her ability to run, fearing that Wei Cheng would continue to question her, and she ran off. Wei Cheng smiled, thinking, "I didn't ask about Miss Cui Zhen, but she has already defended Miss Cui Zhen, this is clearly trying to cover up the truth." (112)

### Starting with Bedbug Medicine

— Pu Fu

Once summer arrives, because the place I live is small and not clean enough, it becomes a place where bedbugs emerge. Every time I wake up in the middle of the night, I can always find many traces left by them on my body. Stroking the wounds, I can't help but sigh, "Did heaven create humans for mosquitoes—now it should be said bedbugs—to live on!"

This makes me think of buying "Pa Wu Dong" (Can't Crawl), which I heard is very effective in killing bedbugs. However, it is too expensive, so I didn't buy it after all, and that was it. After that, I had to put more effort into "diligent catching," because "beside my bed" is "not allowed for others—let alone bedbugs—to snore."

Recently, flipping through the newspapers, I learned that "Pa Wu Dong" can not only kill bedbugs, but is also more "suitable" for killing the poor. People who have struggled once on the road of life finally "can't crawl" because of it. After reading it, I think, "Whose fault is it?"

However, in the eyes of another kind of people, the poor and bedbugs are not much different. It is much quieter if they "can't crawl," because their ability to "crawl" and "crawl high" is built on the "can't crawl" of others. Understanding this allows one to understand the general situation of this society.

But I always hope that what humanity hates is bedbugs, not the poor.

### "Tips" Rise from 10% to 15%

— Dong Shi

"Tips" were originally intended as extra rewards for attentive service. But in Shanghai, regardless of whether the service is attentive or not, a "tip" of 10% is added to the bill when ordering food, the reason is very simple. The restaurant owner does not pay the staff's salary (or the amount is minimal), relying on tips. Many restaurant owners even take a share of the "tips" earned by the staff, which is extremely absurd.

Many waiters in restaurants and hotels have monthly incomes of over a thousand yuan, which is unbelievable! But it is true. With a large daily turnover, the 10% "tips" add up to a considerable amount. Even the "tips" inside the hall are more astonishing than the original "tips." It is not uncommon for guests in the hall to pay five or ten yuan when settling the bill. In those upscale restaurants, the cost of banquets often amounts to two or three thousand yuan, and after deducting the tips, an additional one or two hundred yuan is also commonplace. These diners are, of course, all from the upper class, most of whom have earned a lot from speculative trading and are used to spending lavishly. The waiters are also used to it. If they encounter a friend who is occasionally thrifty and gives a little less, the waiter's expression is often very unpleasant, spending money to buy resentment, only these diners know the score.

Currently, many mid- to low-end restaurants have increased the original "tips" from 10% to 15%, or a more conscientious 13%, because among ordinary diners, most are economically constrained. Given the repeated surge in prices, even friends who were originally generous have reduced their extra rewards. Seeing that this loss cannot be compensated, the restaurant owners have tried to add a tail to the "tips," which is also a way of losing in one place and gaining in another.

Their intention is that whether you give a reward or not is up to you, the tips have already been collected, so it doesn't matter if you don't give.

Then let's not give them extra rewards, giving is just being a fool!

### Tutor

— Wen Chao

After the busy end-of-term exams, the summer vacation began. Mr. He, an elementary school teacher, felt very tired after several days of intense work. After resting at home for two days, worries climbed into his mind again. During the two-month vacation, the school did not pay salaries as usual. How could he get through this difficult time?

A few days ago, Mr. He and several colleagues discussed preparing to run a summer tutoring class during the summer vacation. According to their budget, the tuition fees collected, after expenses, could be divided among several people, amounting to two or three hundred yuan, which would be a small help.

The principal also expressed his agreement, so they printed some regulations, distributed them to the students, and posted a few advertisements at the school gate. They were deeply afraid that students would not come to tutoring due to financial difficulties. Eight weeks of classes, three hours a day, would only cost eight new legal tender yuan, which was lower than any school. However, by the deadline for registration, there were only twenty or so students. Seeing that the class could not be opened, they had to give up in disappointment, and everyone went to think of other ways.

Mr. Yu, who lived across the street, was considered a confidant of Mr. He. They occasionally talked about being idle at home during the summer vacation, having nothing to do, and having no income at all, which was very difficult. Mr. Yu sympathized with him and promised to find him a tutor position through acquaintances, because many wealthy families were afraid that their children would not be willing to study hard at home during the vacation, so they always hired a tutor to supervise their studies, lest their studies be neglected.

Mr. He was very happy, because the income of a tutor was better than that of an elementary school teacher anyway, and the teaching time was also relatively short. If he could gain the trust of the employer, perhaps there would be other good opportunities.

A week later, Mr. Yu invited Mr. He to talk, saying that he had found a tutor position with a monthly salary of one hundred and sixty yuan. It was just a bit far away, working only three and a half hours a day, from 10:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon. Moreover, the two students were only fourteen or fifteen years old and only at the fourth-grade level, so teaching was also very easy.

The next day, Mr. Yu accompanied Mr. He to meet the employer, and the job was decided. When he came back, Mr. Yu repeatedly instructed Mr. He to wear more beautiful clothes in the future, as this family was very wealthy and wanted to maintain their appearance.

Mr. He had no choice but to use the one hundred yuan he had saved in the past five months to make a fake Paris overcoat, which was indeed much more outstanding than the old long gown he was wearing.

Three days later, Mr. He became worried again, because going back and forth every day required taking a car, but the car fare was frighteningly high, at least two yuan. In addition, a lunch also had to be eaten outside. Mr. He was very frugal and, regardless of appearances, always patronized small food stalls, but the price was also not small, four or five yuan per meal. At this rate, he would spend his entire salary every month.

That day, Mr. He met Mr. Yu at the entrance of the alley.

"Are you doing well?" Mr. Yu asked.

"Having a job is the same as having no job!" He really wanted to answer that, but after thinking about it, he felt it was inappropriate, so he said slowly:

"Very good, very good, thank you!"
