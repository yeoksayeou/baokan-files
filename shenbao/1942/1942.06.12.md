### Japanese Troops Knock on Alaska's Door, Causing Deep Impression on America; Pacific Military Conference Convened Yesterday

Lisbon, 11th (Domei News Agency Telegram) - According to Washington sources, upon learning of the Japanese General Headquarters' announcement regarding the Battle of Midway and the attack on the Aleutian Islands, U.S. President Roosevelt immediately convened the Pacific War Council for a meeting. Furthermore, according to sources in the capital of Argentina, the Japanese announcement regarding these battles has created the following impression in the United States:

The Japanese navy has concentrated attacks on key points in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, acting swiftly and unpredictably, making it difficult to anticipate the direction of future Japanese strikes. The Aleutian Islands are the northern gateway to the United States. If they fall under Japanese control, the transportation lines between the United States and Europe via the North Pacific and the Soviet Union will be severed, greatly hindering the joint operations of the Allied nations. The American defense line in the Pacific has already retreated, and due to the imminent danger facing Midway Island, the U.S. Navy will not be able to adopt a defensive strategy, further weakening America's operational capabilities.

Stockholm, 11th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - Local newspapers report that Japan's formal request to occupy the Aleutian Islands has drawn attention from the British side. However, as of now, American officials and American expatriates in London have adopted a silent attitude on this matter.

Tokyo, 11th (Domei News Agency Telegram) - Now, half a year into the war, with Anglo-American forces having been driven out of Greater East Asia, the Japanese army and navy, through ingenious strategies, have turned their offensive to strike at American military strongholds in the Eastern Pacific. It is not difficult to imagine the enemy's disarray in this situation. Today, all newspapers here prominently featured on their front pages with large headlines detailed reports on the Japanese military's attacks on Midway Island and Dutch Harbor, along with commentaries. For example, the "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the United States, gathering its defeated and remnant naval and air forces, intends to form a northern war front with the Aleutian Islands and Midway Island, and a southern war front with the islands south of Hawaii to New Zealand, attempting to launch a counteroffensive. However, in the Battle of the Coral Sea, its southern war front was defeated, and in this operation, its northern war front has also been completely subdued by the Japanese navy. Therefore, the possibility of a large-scale offensive by the American navy has now been completely lost. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that the greatest significance of the battle's achievements is that the Japanese military's capture of these locations has not only destroyed the enemy's bases, making it impossible for the enemy forces to carry out mobile operations, but has also completely shattered their planned strategy for the future of the war. This strike is truly a landmark success in the course of the Greater East Asia War. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that with the arrival of summer, the heavy fog in the Eastern Pacific has dissipated and the waves are calm. The enemy, seizing this opportunity, attempted to launch guerrilla warfare against the Japanese military from various bases in the area, and thus made preparations with all their strength. However, the current Japanese military attack on key points in the Aleutian Islands has first and foremost shattered their intentions. The blow suffered by the United States can be said to be significant.

### Berlin Attaches Importance

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - Berlin newspapers last night prominently featured with large headlines "Japanese Troops Knock on Alaska's Door" the Japanese military's landing operations in the Aleutian Islands. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" stated, "The Japanese military does not give the enemy a chance to breathe. The arrows of the Japanese offensive are shot at the enemy's weak points within a great distance and hit their targets. The excitement stirred up by the Japanese attacks on Madagascar and Sydney has not yet subsided, and now news comes of the Japanese landing in the Aleutian Islands. The United States has often asserted the importance of Dutch Harbor and the Aleutian Islands. Now the fortresses and ports of the Aleutian Islands have become the target of the Japanese offensive, forming the northern pincer of the Japanese military's pincers offensive. As for the center of the southern pincer, it is the American bases in the central Pacific. Since the Japanese military occupied Guam and Wake Island, they have lost their value. The Japanese military's attack on Midway Island shows that the Japanese military is not afraid of the remaining American bases in the Pacific. The Japanese military's attack on Dutch Harbor and the Aleutian Islands has turned the American plan to attack Japan from the northeast into a pipe dream." The "Berliner Abendblatt" stated that the Japanese official announcement of the Japanese military's attack on the Aleutian Islands and Midway Island indicates that the United States has suffered another military setback.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the "Hochi Shimbun," Berlin International Telephone reported on the 10th that after the Japanese General Headquarters announced the battle situation of Midway and the Aleutian Islands, Berlin newspapers immediately prominently featured this news at noon. The German side attaches great importance to the significance of this operation, considering it the first time Japanese troops have landed on American soil, with considerable psychological impact on the future war situation. The past Japanese attacks on Diego Suarez Port and Sydney Port, as well as the current attack on the Aleutian Islands, show that the Japanese military can launch operations anytime, anywhere. This has a significant impact on Chongqing, Australia, and India, and further increases the anxiety of the British people. Furthermore, after the previous attack on Sydney, the Australian authorities tried their best to conceal it. However, due to the recent Japanese military's re-attack, the Australian authorities not only cannot conceal it anymore, but Prime Minister Curtin has also issued a warning to the Australian people, stating that the Australian crisis is becoming increasingly serious and future events will inevitably be more serious. Australian Air Minister Ford called on Britain to send aircraft and the United States to increase supplies, his distressed state has reached the extreme.

### Argentina and Chile Strictly Adhere to Neutrality; Diplomatic Relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan Remain Unchanged

Capital of Argentina, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from Santiago, the Chilean People's Front has always opposed the Chilean government's pro-Axis foreign policy and demanded the severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis countries. On the 10th, President Rios convened the heads of the faction and the leaders of the Socialist Party to hold cordial talks in order to dispel the domestic unrest. It was decided on the spot that diplomatic relations with the Axis countries would not be severed, and the opinions were completely consistent.

### Germany Begins Diplomatic Offensive in Europe; Turkey's Future Attitude Worthy of Attention; Mediation of Romanian-Hungarian Dispute Has Not Yet Been Effective

Stockholm, 10th (Havas News Agency Telegram) - The "Svenska Dagbladet" recently published a telegram from Berlin stating that, based on the recent developments in European international politics, it can be seen that Germany has already begun to prepare an offensive diplomatically. The recent visits of Head of State Hitler to Finnish General Mannerheim, the visit of Hungarian Prime Minister Kallay to the Head of State, and the negotiations conducted by Germany with Bulgaria and Turkey can all be seen as a prelude to Germany's planned military actions. Among them, the relationship between Germany and Turkey is particularly noteworthy. The 16th of this month is the anniversary of the signing of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty, and both countries will hold commemorative ceremonies at that time. It is expected that Germany will reiterate the importance of German-Turkish reconciliation. German newspapers have used large headlines to publish news about Soviet paratroopers attacking the Turkish coast and Soviet submarines attacking Turkish ships. At the same time, semi-official sources say that the development of relations between Germany and Turkey is quite friendly, and both sides are satisfied with this. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will provide guarantees, stating that Germany fully respects Turkey's rights in the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. Hungarian Prime Minister Kallay also assured Hitler during his visit to the Head of State's headquarters that he would unconditionally support Germany, but only to the extent that it does not infringe on Hungarian interests. This guarantee will, of course, make the dispute between Romania and Hungary even more difficult. From this, it can be seen that Germany's mediation of the Outer Transylvania issue has not yet been effective. As for Bulgaria's attitude, it will obviously depend on Turkey's attitude in the future.

Berlin, 10th (Havas News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the meeting between Head of State Hitler and Finnish General Mannerheim, there have been many far-fetched comments from outside. Semi-official German sources recently refuted them, saying that the actions of British and American politicians clearly attempt to induce Finland by trickery to stop its struggle for freedom and security, but the result has not been as they wished. The status of Finland has not changed. In other words, Finland still adheres to the policy of defeating communism to liberate the motherland.

Yesterday, the Romanian newspapers attached great importance to this statement. When Antonescu discussed domestic affairs, he said, "If I could have taken charge earlier, many mistakes could have been avoided. I do not know what a political party is, I only know to select talented people to engage in suitable responsibilities." Romania's alliance with the Axis powers is for the benefit of Romania. Today's sacrifices are the foundation for our future status.

Papen Assassination Case Scheduled for Retrial

Istanbul, 11th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - The trial of the Papen assassination case was adjourned yesterday and postponed to continue on the 17th of this month.

Ankara, 11th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) - The Ankara court magistrate has allowed Soviet defendant Kornyilov in the assassination attempt on German Ambassador to Turkey Papen to defend himself in Turkish.

I believe that the reasons put forward by the prosecutor and the police are not sufficient to be used as strong evidence. I have no relationship with the other defendants." Kornyilov then asked the presiding judge, "The entire investigation has entered a wrong path."

### German Forces Launch Large-Scale Offensive in the Kharkov Area; Sevastopol Under Heavy Fighting; Reports of German Landing on Taman Peninsula

Stockholm, 11th (Havas News Agency): Moscow announced last night that General Bock of the German army has launched a large-scale offensive in the Kharkov area. German infantry, under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft, is continuously attacking the outer defenses of Sevastopol, occupying several bunkers on the high ground. Details of this offensive are not yet known here. News from the Eastern Front is concentrated on Sevastopol, indicating a major battle in the area that has lasted for seven days. The situation for the Red Army is becoming increasingly critical. According to Soviet estimates, no less than 1.5 million German troops are attacking this fortress. After heavy bombing by German aircraft, fires broke out everywhere. Several important high grounds have already fallen into German hands. The German side describes Sevastopol as the world's most solid fortress, with not only old-style fortifications but also new-style reinforced concrete defense works that are difficult to destroy even with heavy bombing. Therefore, this fortress is as impregnable as the Maginot Line and the Metaxas Line. The only way to occupy this fortress is to attack with infantry under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft. The new type of shells first used in the fighting on the Kerch Peninsula were also very effective. The Soviet side also admits that the German forces have an advantage in manpower and material resources. The defenders of Sevastopol will eventually find it difficult to hold out against such a strong enemy. However, as of now, the Soviet side claims that repeated German attacks have been repelled by the Red Army, inflicting heavy losses. Regarding the German large-scale offensive in the Kharkov area, if it is the start of a general German offensive, the German forces will do everything possible to quickly end the Sevastopol war so that they can transfer the troops fighting in Crimea to other theaters of war. An afternoon newspaper here carried a report from a correspondent in Berlin stating that Germany hopes Sevastopol will fall by the end of this week. However, neutral observers believe that the Red Army's resistance will be sustained and cannot be resolved within the next week, because occupying this fortress is even more difficult than occupying Odessa. The fighting in other areas is also intensifying, especially in the Leningrad area. According to Soviet reports, heavy fighting is taking place near Kalinin. The Red Army, under the command of General Khomanov, has made some progress in several places. Partisan units in the central area are very active, appearing and disappearing unpredictably behind German lines, attacking German troops and trains transporting military equipment. The German army is currently engaged in a mopping-up operation.

Stockholm, 11th (Haitong News Agency): According to news received here this morning from the United Press in Moscow, the situation of the Soviet defenders in Sevastopol is becoming increasingly critical. The city is under heavy German attack and is gradually becoming unsustainable. Soviet troops are fighting desperately, holding every inch of ground. German troops are attacking two high grounds, but have not yet been able to break through. The number of aircraft used by both sides is increasing daily.

Berlin, 10th (Havas News Agency): An official war bulletin released today stated that the fighting in Sevastopol is still ongoing. German assault troops have occupied several artillery batteries, largely due to continuous bombing by the German air force. German aircraft groups are also concentrating on bombing the city center and port facilities, which are very important to the Red Army because all kinds of military supplies are transported by sea. After heavy bombing by German aircraft, fires broke out everywhere, and thick smoke immediately covered the sky.

Bern, 10th (Havas News Agency): According to neutral observers, the German assault on Sevastopol proves that the German side attaches importance to the southern military campaign. The German forces intend to first clear Crimea and then launch a large-scale "spring offensive." In addition to having fought in the Kerch and Kharkov areas, the German forces are now actively preparing for a general offensive, sparing no effort. The scale of the offensive will be unprecedented. It is reported that the German side has concentrated a large number of aircraft and heavy artillery on the Sevastopol front, bombarding Soviet lines day and night. The Soviet line there is about twenty-five miles wide. The Soviet authorities have also dispatched elite troops to reinforce the area. The German side knows that they will inevitably encounter fierce resistance from the Red Army. According to the Soviet communique released today, several German assaults on Sevastopol were repelled, inflicting heavy losses. However, the Red Army's newspaper, "Red Star," only stated that the enemy attempted to seize our army's positions near Sevastopol, but was unsuccessful, which is not as definite as the official communique.

Ankara, 10th (Havas News Agency): According to news from the Eastern Front, German troops have landed on the Taman Peninsula opposite Kerch and have occupied the city of Anapa. If this news is true, it means that the German forces have crossed the Kerch Strait and are attempting to gain a foothold in the Caucasus. This is of great military, political, and economic significance, because Anapa is one of the Soviet Union's key ports on the Black Sea, with a railway directly connecting to the Caucasus. Therefore, it is especially important from a military strategic perspective. In addition, German troops are continuing to intensify their attack on Sevastopol, and it is reported that they have occupied fifteen artillery batteries. At this moment, the Axis forces are only five miles away from this fortress. In the Kharkov area, the fighting is quiet. At the same time, in the central and northern sectors, it is not expected that any major battles will occur in the next ten days.

### Sevastopol's Dangerous Terrain is Backed by Mountains

Soviet border area, 10th (Havas News Agency): Sevastopol has been surrounded by German forces for six months, and the battles that have occurred in recent days have been the most intense. The German General Staff intends to prevent the Red Army from attacking the German forces from the rear when they attack the Caucasus in the future to seize its oil resources and thereby threaten the British and Soviet positions in the Middle East. A review of the war reports released by both the German and Soviet sides has reached a fever pitch. The port is backed by mountains, and the foothills are covered with bunkers and newly built fortifications, making it a truly impregnable fortress. Several places were once occupied by the enemy, but were later recaptured by the defenders. Moreover, the two nearby peaks are still in the hands of the Red Army. According to Soviet reports, although these two peaks are subject to heavy bombing by enemy aircraft, one of them, the famous Malakhov Kurgan from the Crimean War of 1855, is still firmly defended by the Red Army. In another defense area, there are many natural caves. Artillery positions are installed inside the caves, protected by rocks, so there is no danger. In short, the main task of the German army is to surround each artillery battery one by one. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet is using the port as a base and has been quite successful in participating in the defense efforts. Naval infantry is also fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Red Army, defending important positions.

### German Forces in North Africa Occupy Bir Hakeim; German Aircraft Groups Assault Egyptian North Coast

From dusk to dawn, the sound of anti-aircraft guns and aircraft continued incessantly. Searchlights and flares illuminated the sky. The drill suddenly stopped after two large four-engine Red Cross aircraft transported wounded soldiers from Malta to Gibraltar.

### Palestine, the Holy Land of Religion

The Promised Land Discovered by Moses

Long ago, Abraham, the tribal chief of Ur in Chaldea, had many sons, the most beloved of whom was Joseph. Joseph was harmed by his brothers and lived in exile in Egypt, eventually becoming a famous king of Egypt. Not long after, Abraham's eldest son, Jacob, and his entourage, faced with a great famine, fled to Egypt and met their wealthy younger brother Joseph, who had been exiled. They were able to occupy fertile land and settle down in Egypt as a family. This is the beginning of the history of the Hebrew lineage of the Semitic race. This is also the distant origin of Palestine becoming the birthplace of the Hebrews.

The descendants of Abraham, the tribal chief who settled in Egypt after being exiled, later suffered oppression from the Egyptians, doing the grueling work of moving bricks and digging mud under the scorching sun. In the midst of their struggles, a leader named Moses emerged among them. With religious faith, he steadfastly adhered to the teachings of Jehovah and established ten commandments for the Hebrews to live by. He led his clan out of Egypt, passing through the Sinai Peninsula next to the present-day Suez Canal, and entering the fertile land of Canaan, suitable for farming and herding. He arranged the so-called twelve tribes of Israel. Where is this Canaan? It is today's Palestine, known as the British Mandate.

Here, the rivers flow smoothly and it is near the Mediterranean Sea, suitable for commerce and industry. No wonder the Israelites, having experienced exile and hardship, regarded it as a promised land and settled down in peace. After settling down, they built a unified kingdom around 1050 BC. There were several famous kings, such as David, known for his military achievements, and Solomon, known for his wisdom. The ruins of the great temple he built are the famous historical site in Palestine, the "Wailing Wall." At this time, the word "Hebrew" represented not only a nation with a simple blood relationship, but also a nation-state with religion, culture, and politics. Its degree of unity and development was no less than that of several strong European countries today. Unfortunately, after 953 BC, this kingdom tended to split due to internal strife. Generally speaking, the area north of the Dead Sea was called the Kingdom of Israel, and the area south of the Dead Sea was called the Kingdom of Judah. The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrian Empire in 722 BC, and its people were moved to Mesopotamia, scattered and disorganized. The Kingdom of Judah was also destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BC, and its people were also moved to the lower reaches of the Two Rivers, also scattered and disorganized.

Alas, these children of Abraham have never formally returned to their homeland to establish a unified nation-state. The name "Canaan" is permanently recorded in the Old Testament, but this land has changed many masters, changed many names, and changed many cultural appearances. First the Persians came to rule, then the Romans came to rule. Later, the Arabs rose up, and a large number of Arabs migrated from the desert. The homeland of the Hebrews became in fact the homeland of the Arabs. The name of the Canaan area has been repeatedly changed to become the current title of Mandate.

Thus, the promised land of the Hebrews discovered by Moses has become another's promised land.

### Deputy Administrative Head of Bohemia-Moravia, General Daluege, Appointed Successor; All Adult Males in Lidice Executed, Women Sent to Concentration Camps, Children Sent to Reformatories

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency): After the state funeral of Reinhard Heydrich, the Acting Protector of Bohemia-Moravia, the German Führer Hitler met with President Hácha and Ambassador Chvalkovský, the Protectorate’s envoy to Berlin. SS leader Himmler was also present.

Prague, 11th (Haitong News Agency): The official report, released today in Prague, regarding the destruction of the town of Lidice, near Kladno, in Bohemia-Moravia, claims that the investigation into the assassination of Acting Protector Reinhard Heydrich revealed that the residents of Lidice were suspected of harboring and aiding the assassins, and that evidence of opposition to Germany was found in the town, including reactionary leaflets, firearms, weapons, illegal radio broadcasting equipment, and a large quantity of controlled goods. It was also determined that the residents of the town were engaged in activities on behalf of Germany’s foreign enemies. Therefore, it was decided that all adult males in the town would be executed, all women would be sent to concentration camps, and the children would be sent to reformatories. The town has been razed to the ground, and its name has been abolished. The town had 483 residents.

Prague, 11th (Haitong News Agency): The Prague court yesterday sentenced another twenty-five people to death. The Brno court also sentenced six people to death. Twenty-one of them agreed to assassinate Heydrich and appealed for aid for the assassins. Among them were one newspaper editor, one bank clerk, one lawyer, one local judge, one legal advisor, one former Czech army major, and one business school professor. Nine of the defendants were in contact with people who were supposed to register with the police and provided them with housing. These acts were clearly contrary to German interests. One of the other defendants failed to register with the police. Five of the thirty-one defendants were Jewish.

Stockholm, 11th (Havas News Agency): According to news from Berlin, after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the acting administrator of the Czech Protectorate, Führer Hitler ordered General Daluege to succeed him. Prague Radio has announced that another thirty-one people have been executed in connection with the Heydrich assassination, bringing the total to three hundred and five. It has been confirmed that the German military authorities have executed all the able-bodied men in the town of Lidice in the Bohemian district and confined the women in concentration camps.

### Second Anniversary of Italy's Entry into the War

Rome, 10th (Havas News Agency): Today marks the second anniversary of Italy's entry into the war. The Stefani News Agency published an article reviewing Italy's progress in various fields, stating in brief: "Our country has inevitably suffered losses after two years of war, but the strength of our army, navy, and air force has actually increased significantly. Our military-industrial sector is fully engaged in production. We initially encountered some difficulties, but we have resolved them one by one based on scientific principles. The government has also taken various steps to ensure that the country is self-sufficient in food. Our finances are also extremely stable, and the public is automatically buying war bonds. Even if there are difficulties in food in the future, they can be solved by relying on the public's adherence to discipline. The people of Italy generally believe that this war is unavoidable, so we must go all out to seek final victory. The whole nation fully trusts the Prime Minister, knowing that the Prime Minister has done everything possible in the past to avoid this war."

### French Ships in Martinique Disarmed; U.S.-French Negotiations Progress Smoothly

Vichy, 10th (Havas News Agency): According to semi-official sources, the negotiations between France and the United States regarding the French island of Martinique are progressing smoothly. Several French warships in Fort-de-France have been disarmed and "frozen" for a considerable period of time. There are still some issues outstanding, but it is hoped that an agreement satisfactory to both sides can be reached after continued discussions over the next few weeks.

### Actions of British Occupation Forces in Madagascar

Vichy, 10th (Havas News Agency): According to telegrams from Madagascar, a British mechanized unit occupied the city of Ambilobe on May 24th and then advanced towards the port of Antalaha. However, after occupying it for several hours, they withdrew to their base in Diego Suarez on June 6th.

### Iran Recognizes de Gaulle Committee

Ankara, 11th (Haitong News Agency): Reports from the Iranian capital state that the Iranian government has decided to recognize the National Committee headed by General de Gaulle as the legitimate representative of France. Negotiations on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries are expected to begin soon.

Ankara, 11th (Haitong News Agency): According to news from Cairo, after the Egyptian government decided not to recognize de Gaulle's National Committee, British officials in Egypt expressed great dissatisfaction. The Egyptian authorities were willing to recognize the committee as the representative of legal entities residing in Egypt. General Catroux personally came to Cairo on behalf of General de Gaulle to negotiate. At the same time, British Ambassador Lampson put pressure on the Egyptian government. However, Egypt took this kind of attitude, which made the British side even more displeased.

### Thailand's Construction Projects Are Actively Underway, Striving to Promote Various Industries to Establish a Self-Sufficient Economy

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) – According to the Bangkok Post, present-day Thailand has not only completely shed its past reliance on Britain and the United States, but is also steadily advancing on the path of construction as part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.  Prime Minister Phibun Songkhram, facing this unprecedented difficult situation, is especially leading the nation to take various appropriate measures at any time, cooperating with Japan to build a New East Asia.  Only in this way can Thailand become a truly independent nation.  Currently, under the leadership of Phibun Songkhram, Thailand's new construction policies are: first, to revitalize the national spirit, and second, to establish a self-sufficient economy.  These two aspects are also the path that a new Thailand should follow.  Regarding the revitalization of the national spirit, the recent abolition of titles of nobility was the first step, implemented from May 15th.  The more than 300-year-old nobility system was completely abolished in order to break down classes and implement equality.  Therefore, it can be said to be a kind of social revolution within Thailand.  The second is the renewal of the education system.  After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to indiscriminate bombing by British aircraft, schools at all levels in Thailand have been suspended since last December.  They have now been fully restored from May 18th.  Therefore, male and female students in uniforms in Bangkok have also shown their energetic appearance.  The past imitation of European and American ideologies has also been completely abandoned, and all efforts are devoted to nationalistic spiritual education and scientific education necessary for modern nations.  At the same time, the government is actively promoting the activities of the (Youth Corps) and (Women's Youth Corps), and organizing youth service teams and women's labor teams, so that they can serve the country and society at any time.  In addition, in order to improve the people's livelihood and discipline clothing, the New Life Movement will be promoted on a larger scale, and a Ministry of Health will be established to enhance the physical fitness of the people.  Regarding the reconstruction of the economy, it is currently the most important issue for Thailand.  In the past, Thailand's production of rubber, teak, etc. was mostly exported to Europe and the United States, while industrial products completely relied on the supply of these countries.  At present, the original economic situation has changed due to the war.  In order to alleviate the shortage of materials, prevent price increases, and stabilize the people's livelihood, the Thai government is practicing economy on the negative side and setting official prices.  On the positive side, it is working hard to promote the industrialization of Thai industries.  In order to achieve economic self-sufficiency, the government has now raised 15 million bahts (Thai currency) to establish an industrial promotion company, and has separated the Industry Bureau, originally under the Ministry of Economy, to become the Ministry of Industry.  The ministry is further divided into four bureaus: Industrial Promotion, Factories, Mines, and Science.  Therefore, Thailand's industries will be able to develop more rapidly.  At the same time, plans have been initiated to establish factories for papermaking, winemaking, sugar refining, tobacco, canning, rubber, and gunny bags.  When these plans are realized, the Thai economy will be self-sufficient.  Currently, Japan is providing technical and material assistance, and it is hoped that it will be successful soon.  The Land of the White Elephant, with the cooperation of Japan, is now steadily moving towards the great road of building Asia for Asians.

### Pacific Hurricane Season Approaching, Reporting Difficult This Year, Flood Control Facilities Are Being Constructed Separately, High Tide Expected in the Huangpu River During the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival

From the first day of next month, the hurricane season in the South Pacific will arrive again.  If a hurricane strikes Shanghai, the observatory will report the direction of the wind's progress and the strength of the wind.  The Jianghai Customs will also hang black balls on the roof as a warning.  However, this year, due to the war in the Pacific, reporting hurricane news will be even more difficult.  Regarding the high tide volume during the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival, according to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Huangpu Bureau, a high tide is expected in the Huangpu River during the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival, with a volume of about eleven feet.  There will be two tides, morning and afternoon.  If there is wind and rain during the tide, water will be seen spurting out of the sewers in low-lying roads.  As for the flood control projects on various low-lying roads, the Public Works Department of the工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) is currently carrying them out separately.  The flood control projects have not yet been fully completed.

In order to avoid waterlogging in the public concession, six pumping stations are being built in the central, northwest, and west districts.  Among the three located in the central district, the two in the Er Yangjing Bridge and Old Gate districts will be completed successively.  The one at Yu Qiaqing Road and Nicheng Bridge has not yet been started, but it is believed that it will begin soon.  There are two pumping stations in the northern district, located at the intersection of Bazilu (靶子路) and Feilunlu (斐倫路), and at the intersection of Zhapeilu (乍沛路) and Tiantonglu (天潼路), which are being built at an accelerated pace.  As for the western district, because all the large sewers are east-west and do not flow into rivers, it is necessary to first build a north-south cross-sectional large sewer to collect the water from all the east-west sewers and discharge it into the Suzhou River near Maigen Road.  Since the cross-sectional sewer has not yet been built, the establishment of the pumping station is also pending.  According to the plan, the western district pumping station will be located near the Suzhou River on Maigen Road, and its scale will be much larger than other pumping stations.  According to the Shanghai Times, an official of the French Municipal Council (法公董局) told the newspaper reporter the day before that there were no plans for flood control projects in the French Concession because the huge funds required were very difficult to raise.  At present, only small-scale work is being carried out, and it is still difficult to predict whether large-scale projects will be implemented this year.

### Citizen Certificates Issued in Three Police Districts

The保甲 (Baojia) system of the Central, Old Gate, Chengdu, New Gate, Gordon, Jing'an Temple, and Putuo police districts of the Public Concession is still continuing to collect citizen certificate applications. Therefore, there are lines of people submitting citizen certificate application forms in front of each police station. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Central, New Gate, and Jing'an Temple districts have already issued the first batch of official citizen certificates to those who submitted application forms. The other four districts are now actively urging the submission of citizen certificate applications. In the past, there were not a few cases where householders (i.e., sub-landlords) and attached households (i.e., tenants) had old grudges, resulting in householders refusing to vouch for tenants. This caused delays in the submission of application forms. Now that the保甲 (Baojia) department has stated that sub-landlords must not refuse to vouch for tenants, the efficiency of issuing citizen certificates should be greatly improved.

### Average Prices of Goods on Wednesdays

### 防疫證 (Epidemic Prevention Certificate) Required for 法租界 (French Concession) Return-to-Hometown Certificate

The certificate issuing office of the Lugiawan Police Station in the French Concession publicly announced yesterday that all applicants for special return-to-hometown permits must have an epidemic prevention certificate.  Furthermore, the certificate application procedure at the office is slightly different from that of the Public Concession. Applicants must obtain an application form from the police station on duty between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM every day, and then exchange it for an official permit between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM the next afternoon. Therefore, the procedure must be divided into two steps.

### 公園派司 (Park Pass) Price Increase

The prices of long-term park passes in the Public Concession and the French Concession of this port have recently changed. In the Public Concession, the annual pass for Zhaofeng Park is 10 yuan in储券 (Central Reserve Bank Notes), and the Bund Park is 5 yuan. As for the French Park in the French Concession, it has also been increased to 12 yuan in 储券 (Central Reserve Bank Notes).

### 板料 (Plank Material) Price Soars, Corpses Found on the Road Are Jointly Coffin-Buried, Up to 20 Children's Corpses in Each Coffin, Nanshi (南市) Already Using Straw Instead of Coffins

The corpses found on the roads of the French Concession and Nanshi (南市), Huxi (沪西), Pudong (浦東) and other places are collected and buried by the 同仁輔兀分堂 (Tongren Funeral Home). Before the war, the required plank coffins and labor costs were paid for from property income. After the war, most of the real estate rents could not be collected, and the funds for the charitable act of collecting corpses were entirely supported by donations. However, recently, due to the environmental situation in the city, donations have decreased, and the value of plank material has soared dozens of times, making it impossible to deal with. For collecting corpses in the concession, except for the generally neat attire of the corpses, to prevent relatives from recognizing them later, they are still given one coffin per corpse. For the truly impoverished corpses, two corpses are jointly coffin-buried. As for children's corpses, each coffin contains a number ranging from five or six to nearly twenty, depending on the size of the corpses. In the Nanshi (南市) area, due to financial constraints, it is heard that straw nests resembling coffins have been made to collect and bury corpses. It is deeply hoped that philanthropists in Shanghai will urgently provide continuous donations to comfort the souls of the dead in general and the suffering of those buried without coffins.

### Two Concessions Continue to Implement and Promote the 保甲 (Baojia) System, Ye Fuxiao Appointed Chairman of the 保甲 (Baojia) Committee, Currently Discussing Cooperation Methods with the Police

In view of the success of the implementation of the 保甲 (Baojia) system, the Public Concession 工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) specially invited the heads of the联保 (Lianbao, joint guarantees) and 保甲 (Baojia) committee members to a banquet at the Jinmen Hotel at 7:00 PM on the 10th to exchange opinions. The police hosted a banquet to discuss various points.

The attendees included Police Chief渡正 (Watarai Tadashi), Deputy Chief 伍島 (Goshima), 工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council)董袁履登 (Dong Yuanludeng), 保甲 (Baojia) Guidance Department 重田光治 (Shigeta Mitsuji), A District Chief 及川 (Arakawa), Translator 洪翰賓 (Hong Hanbin), Central District Deputy Chief 联保 (Lianbao)邵樂平 (Shao Leping), New Gate District Chief 联保 (Lianbao)謝葆生 (Xie Baosheng), Gordon District Chief 联保 (Lianbao)周乾康 (Zhou Qiankang), Jing'an Temple District Chief 联保 (Lianbao)羅友蘭 (Luo Youlan), Old Gate District Chief 联保 (Lianbao)王廉方 (Wang Lianfang), Deputy Chief 联保 (Lianbao)陳承蔭 (Chen Chengyin),郭琳爽 (Guo Linshuang), Putuo District Chief 联保 (Lianbao)陳蔚文 (Chen Weiwen), Chengdu District Chief 联保 (Lianbao)劉良 (Liu Liang), 保甲 (Baojia) committee members王伯元 (Wang Boyuan),余華龍 (Yu Hualong), and more than 30 other people. During the banquet, Police Chief渡正 (Watarai Tadashi) and Deputy Chief 伍島 (Goshima) gave speeches successively, stating that the decrease in robberies, kidnappings, and terrorist incidents in the Public Concession showed the effectiveness of the implementation of the 保甲 (Baojia) system, and that the 工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) was deeply grateful for the cooperation of the chiefs 联保 (Lianbao) and 保甲 (Baojia) committee members in the 保甲 (Baojia) field. Next, 袁履登 (Yuan Lvdeng) gave a speech, hoping to increase communication between the 保甲 (Baojia) Guidance Department and the chiefs 联保 (Lianbao), so that the implementation of the 保甲 (Baojia) system would be more successful. Then, 王廉方 (Wang Lianfang) gave a speech of thanks and bought献 (bought offered) opinions to promote the cooperation between the self-defense corps and the patrolmen. Finally, Ye Fuxiao was appointed as the chairman of the 保甲 (Baojia) committee, and it was decided that the standing committee of the 保甲 (Baojia) committee would be held on the seventh floor of the 工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) next Tuesday to discuss the progress of matters. It ended at 10:00 PM. 法租界 (French Concession) Reviews Household Registration Forms

Datong News Agency reported that the French Concession police are stepping up the 保甲 (Baojia) system. They are currently reviewing the forms filled out by the households submitted by the chiefs 联保 (Lianbao), and are issuing notices to the citizens, urging them to fill out the forms accurately in accordance with the regulations. Any discrepancies or errors will be treated as disobedience and fined. However, those who have filled them out accurately in the early stages will not be held accountable.

### Strict Investigation of Rice Sales, Those Who Cut in Line to Buy Rice Are Arrested, Those Who Sell Beyond the Limit Are Fined

Yesterday, when rice shops in the two concessions sold 洋米 (foreign rice), patrolmen still enforced queuing and numbering, and strictly monitored whether anyone cut in line. Once found, they were arrested and punished by the police. The Price Control Committee of the 工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) has been sending people to various rice shops in recent days to investigate whether 洋米 (foreign rice) is being sold in excess of the limited quantity, which is extremely strict, resulting in several rice shops being investigated and punished, with fines ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 in 储钞 (Central Reserve Bank Notes).

### Cafeteria Opened to Aid Impoverished Portuguese Nationals, Planned Relief for 500 People

Most of the Portuguese nationals in this port have been unemployed since the Pacific War and are struggling to make a living. According to reports yesterday, a soup kitchen will be established soon to provide food to those in urgent need. The address of the soup kitchen will be located in the Portuguese General Association or somewhere in the central district, and will be subsidized by the government in Lisbon. Therefore, any Portuguese national in this port has the right to enjoy it. As for the system of distribution, it is expected to follow the example of the American school for American nationals on Beidang Road, where food is prepared in advance by the soup kitchen, and those who want to eat must show a food card, which has a certain validity period, but can be renewed after it expires. It is heard that several Portuguese leaders are now jointly planning this method, as they generally feel the need for such relief measures. Furthermore, this relief measure will be handled by the Portuguese Central Association. If the current plan can be realized, the soup kitchen will be established at the beginning of next month. According to the English-language 大美晚报 (Great American Evening Post), there are approximately 2,700 Portuguese nationals in this city, of whom approximately 500 are in dire need of relief. The Portuguese Association plans to open a cafeteria to provide free meals to these impoverished Portuguese nationals, or slightly charge for meals. According to the current plan, the cafeteria will set up distribution points in various parts of the city, such as the American cafeteria. Its funding will be raised from the Portuguese community, initially limited to providing relief to 500 people, and then finding ways to expand the scope so that all impoverished Portuguese nationals can be fed and clothed.

### All Sectors Enthusiastically Contribute to Our Newspaper's Student Aid Fund

Previous balance: 34,224.59 yuan in 储券 (Central Reserve Bank Notes). Total balance: 34,591.86 yuan in 储券 (Central Reserve Bank Notes).

### Zhou Qinzhu Married in Tears, Two Younger Brothers Executed the Day Before the Wedding

It is now learned that the remains of the two parricidal sons were delivered to the Shangtian Funeral Home yesterday morning and are scheduled for a grand funeral this morning. At the same time, it is heard that Zhou Qinzhu, the elder sister who exposed the two parricidal sons' patricide, happened to hold her wedding with a certain Mr. Feng at a certain auditorium yesterday. Unexpectedly, heaven did not favor her, and her two younger brothers were executed the day before. However, because everything had been prepared, she had to hold the wedding in tears, which was truly a great misfortune.

### Three Robbers Rob a Pharmacy

Yesterday morning at around 7:30 AM, when the staff of the Hua Yuan Pharmacy at 529 Pingliang Road in Hudong were opening the store, three robbers suddenly came, pretending to be customers and entering the store. They immediately drew out their weapons and drove the staff into the stove room, tying them up with ropes and threatening them to reveal where the money was hidden. The staff replied that the store had not yet opened and there was no cash in the counter. The three robbers, disappointed, then robbed drugs such as 消治龍 (digestive enzyme preparation) produced by the German Bayer pharmaceutical factory and the Ruixin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory from the cabinets, worth more than 4,000 yuan, and fled without a trace.

### Fire on Pingliang Road

Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the Xiaolin Co., Ltd., a Japanese company at 675 Pingliang Road, suddenly caught fire due to negligence. The fire brigade was informed and rushed to the rescue, and the fire was extinguished after half an hour. The loss is said to be significant.

### Japanese and Military-Managed Factories and Companies to Stop Receiving and Paying Old 法幣 (Legal Tender), Decision to Implement from the 17th of This Month, Must Obtain Approval from the 興亞院 (Asia Development Board) If Necessary

According to the Domei News Agency, since the 10th, Chinese and Japanese banks in Shanghai have stopped receiving and paying all old 法幣 (Legal Tender) except for exchanging it. Now, major Japanese companies and military-managed companies are following suit to show their cooperation with the new currency policy, deciding to convert all old 法幣 (Legal Tender) into 储券 (Central Reserve Bank Notes), and to stop receiving and paying old 法幣 (Legal Tender) from June 17th, abolishing the old 法幣 (Legal Tender) transactions and completely switching to 储券 (Central Reserve Bank Notes) transactions in order to promote the exchange work. The 興亞院 (Asia Development Board) Central China Liaison Department issued a statement on the 11th regarding this matter as follows: Major Japanese companies and military-managed companies will also stop receiving and paying old 法幣 (Legal Tender) from the 17th of this month. The old 法幣 (Legal Tender) transactions will be completely changed to 储券 (Central Reserve Bank Notes) (auxiliary coins are not included). The National Government announced that the full exchange will be implemented from June 8th. At present, major Japanese companies in Shanghai, such as state-owned companies, textile companies, companies affiliated to the Central China Importers Association, member companies of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and other major Japanese companies, as well as military-managed companies, such as military-managed public utilities companies, real estate companies, hotels, apartments, cinemas, etc., are all cooperating with the new currency policy. At the same time, in order to prevent the value of the old 法幣 (Legal Tender) from decreasing further after the exchange period, they have decided to convert all existing old 法幣 (Legal Tender) into 储券 (Central Reserve Bank Notes) and stop receiving and paying old 法幣 (Legal Tender) from the 17th. All old 法幣 (Legal Tender) transactions and payments using old 法幣 (Legal Tender) will be replaced with 储券 (Central Reserve Bank Notes). It is specifically stipulated that if it is necessary to use old 法幣 (Legal Tender) in the Shanghai area, it must be submitted to the 興亞院 (Asia Development Board) for approval in advance.

As for military currency transactions, they will continue as before. It is hoped that merchants and customers who have transactions with the above-mentioned Japanese companies and military-managed companies will understand the true meaning of the above and exchange all old 法幣 (Legal Tender) to abolish all old 法幣 (Legal Tender) transactions.

### Central China Transportation Company to Operate Water-Land Intermodal Transportation, Capital of 8 Million Yen, Established on July 1st

According to Domei News Agency, the 興亞院 (Asia Development Board) Central China Liaison Department and related Chinese and Japanese agencies, in view of the urgency of adjusting and expanding the transportation industry in Central China, had previously negotiated the establishment of a controlled company to unify the Central China small transportation industry. It has recently been decided that Chinese and Japanese parties will jointly invest in the establishment of Central China Transportation Co., Ltd. as an affiliated organization of the Central China Revitalization Company. The 興亞院 (Asia Development Board) announced this on the 10th. The operating objective of the new company is to handle intermodal transportation between large transportation agencies such as railways and ships, and to unify the operation of other small transportation industries. The company's capital is set at 8 million yen. The Central China Revitalization Company invests in cash, and the Japan Express Co., Ltd., East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd., Central China Railway Co., Ltd., Shanghai Inland River Shipping Co., Ltd., China Shipping Co., Ltd., and other Chinese and Japanese merchants invest in kind.

Planned Objectives

Regarding this matter, the 興亞院 (Asia Development Board) Central China Liaison Department stated that, in order to adapt to the plan to enhance the transportation agencies in Central China, the 興亞院 (Asia Development Board) Central China Liaison Department and related Chinese and Japanese agencies intend to adjust and expand the transportation industry related to this in order to revitalize the economy of Central China. Since the consultation on the establishment of a Chinese-Japanese joint transportation company, opinions have recently become completely consistent. The preparations for the establishment will be carried out as soon as possible with the goal of establishing the company on July 1st. The promoters from both China and Japan have also been determined, and a promoters' meeting can be held recently. According to the nature of the company, it is a common joint-stock organization of the Republic of China. Its name is Central China Transportation Co., Ltd. (Japanese name: 華中運輸株式會社). The company aims to operate the following businesses: 小運輸業 (Small transportation industry), 與小運輸業有關係之倉庫業 (Warehouse industry related to the small transportation industry), 承包勞工代辦報關業務 (Contracting labor and customs declaration services), 經營與上述各項有關係之事業並向之投資或放款 (Operating businesses related to the above and investing or lending to them).

Adjusting Freight Transport

The transportation of goods must be carried out smoothly without stagnation only if large transportation agencies such as railways and ships are perfectly connected with transportation agencies that provide connecting transportation. Therefore, the latter has a huge impact on the lives of the general public, no less than the former. Due to geographical and economic relations, these transportation agencies in various parts of Central China bear extremely important duties, but their importance is often overlooked, which is deeply regrettable. At present, hundreds of large and small transportation companies operate their businesses in Central China under a complex business structure. It is currently an urgent task to give a consistent system and context to this situation. The company is established this time through Chinese-Japanese cooperation, and its goal is entirely at this point. Therefore, in the future, it is planned to use the company as a central agency to adjust and enhance transportation in Central China.

### First Batch of Evacuating American Nationals Have All Set Off for Shanghai, A Batch of 52 Near Nanjing Departed Yesterday

A small batch of British and American nationals arrived in Shanghai by ship from Qingdao on the evening of the 9th to await the evacuation ship to Portuguese East Africa in mid-month. Also, the first batch of evacuating Allied nationals from Nanjing and surrounding areas, a total of 52 American diplomatic personnel and missionaries, set off for Shanghai on the 11th. Among this batch of American nationals, 31 are from Nanjing, 8 from Huaiyuan, 2 from Zhenjiang, 1 from Changzhou, and the remaining 10 from various places on the Beijing-Shanghai line. As for the evacuating British and Canadian nationals, it is heard that they will leave Beijing for Shanghai next month.

### A Collection of Summer Goods Before Your Eyes; Sighing at the Marked Prices: Exquisite Small Fans Cost at Least Over Ten Yuan; Women's Short Coats Cost at Least Several Hundred Yuan

In the past few days, when the financial market was undergoing changes, it kept the general money brokers busy and the small merchants anxious. Only the poor scholars who were oblivious to worldly affairs were genuinely carefree, strolling leisurely through the bustling downtown area where everyone was rushing about for paper money, just to watch the scenery. Even if their carefree demeanor was feigned, it was still enough to make the busy people who were panting all day envious.

The patrol officers at the park entrance have already put up their umbrellas, and the doormen of Western-style hotels have changed into their crisp white uniforms. The windows of candy stores are plastered with advertisements for cold drinks, a blend of Chinese and Western styles, that are now on the market. Fabric stores display white silk cloth, summer women's hats, white leather shoes, and small sandalwood bone fans, all arranged artistically, telling you that summer has arrived in Shanghai.

Prices Vary

Some not only do not increase prices but still use old legal tender; this is a large advertisement for a large discount foreign general merchandise store. Some mark prices in Central Reserve Bank notes, which is another advertisement for a foreign goods store. Some are marked with O·R·B, and some are marked with legal tender. After buying three yuan worth of goods, paying with a five-yuan legal tender note from the Central Bank, one receives a one-yuan Central Reserve Bank note in change. On the bus, for a nine-jiao ticket, paying with a half-yuan Central Reserve Bank note results in receiving a one-jiao note from the Central Bank. All these trivial matters are extremely common, but those involved have a somewhat peculiar feeling. Ordinary women, shop assistants, and villagers are often at a loss, unsure of what to do. It's truly like the weather at this time, with sunshine and rain, making it difficult to decide whether to bring an umbrella or wear a raincoat, leaving people at a loss on how to cope.

Inventory from the UK and the US

Shanghai is indeed a major commercial port. Despite the fact that European and American ships have not come to Shanghai for half a year, there are still European and American goods available to supply you. Almost every fabric store has American "Summer Shaker" cloth on display, and the women's short coats or white broadcloth or white woolen coats in fashion stores are also British and American goods. Even the cream-colored embroidered summer curtains are mostly British products. Even the American spices for making homemade cold drinks are sold in bags of original packaging. Everything is available in stock, but the prices are high. A woman's white short coat costs at least four or five hundred yuan in old legal tender. Men's white leather boots, lower-quality goods, cost one hundred seventy yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, and better ones cost two hundred forty yuan. A woman's linen handbag costs at least fifty old legal tender, while foreign white patent leather bags cost two to four or five hundred, depending on the style.

Fans and Hats

The most attractive summer goods are fans from China and straw hats from the West. Fans for men and women are already on the market. Women's sandalwood bone fans are made small and exquisite, some with carvings and some with paintings, all decorated with real silk tassels, each starting at over ten yuan in old legal tender. Men's bamboo bone fans, or sandalwood fans, with a painting by an artist, are also quite expensive, with over ten yuan being the cheapest. Sandalwood bone or finely carved bamboo old fan bones cost from sixty or seventy yuan to one or two hundred yuan in old legal tender. If you have old carved fan bones at home and go to a paper shop to have a clay fan surface fitted, you will also be taken aback, and you will still end up with an old fan bone. However, this year, many places are canceling electric fans and air conditioning to save money, so fans cannot be dispensed with. Many people will carefully consider buying fans.

Western women's hats are strange and wonderful, most worthy of seeing. At this time, many stores still display women's hats, but the scene is not as lively as in previous years. Some Chinese foreign goods stores are also taking advantage of the excitement to make Western-style women's hats. There is a sun hat that looks like the one worn by a horse rider, with a large tongue made of green celluloid in front. It is peculiar, but it is not known what kind of woman will buy it, whether it is for playing ball or riding a bicycle. The large cool hats that French merchants bring from Annam are now in season and are also displayed as before.

Flower stalls and flower shops, with their vibrant colors, seem to be smiling coquettishly, enticing people. Usually, buying flowers in early summer is the cheapest, but now, putting a few flowers on the desk is also very expensive, starting at two or three yuan at the minimum, and more beautiful ones cost over ten yuan.

In this early summer, which is sometimes hot and humid and sometimes rainy, one becomes dizzy and has no solution. Apart from looking at the weather, taking a leisurely stroll on the street can relieve some of the stuffiness. I wonder what the readers think?

Coquettish Smiling Flowers

Summer is again the season when hundreds of flowers are in full bloom. The parks, when viewed from afar, are truly a scene of brocade, with red, yellow, blue, and white intertwined, which is very beautiful. The ones along the road are also very ordinary. If you want to buy flower vases for flower arrangement, it is even more of a luxury. A very ordinary glass vase costs seven or eight yuan, and porcelain vases that are pleasing to the eye cost tens or hundreds of yuan, which is not surprising.

### Street Scenes in Early Summer

Elegant Suzhou and Hangzhou fans and soft straw hats are the embellishments of early summer. In previous years at this time, fan shops and hat shops were overwhelmed with customers. Now, a fan requires ten gold coins, and a hat requires dozens of gold coins to satisfy the buyer. The elegance is not enough, and the selection requires much deliberation, which is also a manifestation of the economic strength of the citizens.

### Obsessed with Women, Disregarding Consequences: Retraction in the Dance Hall Bloodshed Case; Lin Siqing and Others Were Instructed by Shen Meiying to Commit the Crime Partial to Her; the Main Culprit Caused Unnecessary Complications

At 10:30 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, at the Shanghai Ballroom at 440 Guangdong Road, a dispute arose because a dance patron, Lin Siqing, and another dance patron, Ye Beiqiu, were fighting over a dance hostess, Shen Meiying, for a seat. The ballroom inspector, Xue Linlin (also known as Zhaoxiong), the dance hostess supervisor Lou Minwei, and tea servants Zhao Jingen and Shao Amao surrounded and beat the dance patron. Xue even used iron bars to strike the heads and other parts of the dance patrons, causing the death of dance patron Chen Yunlai due to injuries, and injuries to Lin Siqing, Sun Metao, Zhou Jianming, and Chen Shugang.

Xue Zhaoxiong Suddenly Changes His Testimony

After the Lao Zha Police Station’s Chinese Detective Liu Junjie and Detective Chen Junfeng arrested Xue and the other three, it was found that Xue and Lou were both hooligans who were prone to fighting and had been criminally punished for causing bodily harm. During questioning, Xue initially confessed to killing Chen Yunlai and injuring Lin and others, and a written confession was made. Later, he suddenly changed his testimony, denying the crime, saying that he only participated in mediating and calling the police station. Unexpectedly, the ballroom owner instructed him to admit to being the perpetrator in order to eliminate responsibility, and promised to continue paying his monthly salary to his family and was willing to provide an additional 10,000 yuan as a settlement fee. He also claimed that he could smooth things over with the plaintiff's side and would not be prosecuted, so the sentence would be at most one year, etc. He was deceived at the time, so he attributed the responsibility for the trouble to himself alone, but the actual perpetrator was not him.

Plaintiff Makes False Testimony Due to Obsession with Women

The police station attached great importance to this matter and was conducting a strict investigation. However, during the interrogation, Lin Siqing, Sun Metao, and Zhou Jianming suddenly gave vague testimonies, favoring the perpetrators. Their testimony at the police station at the time was very detailed, and there were obvious inconsistencies. After investigation by Chinese Detective Yin Mengfei, the truth was revealed. After Xue Linlin was arrested, he immediately ordered his mistress, Li Juying, a Shanghai native, to discuss with Shen Meiying and instruct her to send a telegram to Lin Siqing, asking him not to attack. Shen agreed, and after Lin and others received the phone call from Shen, they were obsessed with women and disregarded the consequences, making false statements in the hope of exonerating Xue. The detectives, after a thorough investigation of the case, were seriously hampered by the change of testimony by Lin and others. Therefore, Lin Siqing, Sun Metao, Zhou Jianming, Shen Meiying, and Li Juying were all arrested and detained for interrogation to determine their crime of perjury.

As the season enters summer, the swimming season is approaching. This reporter met with Mr. Li Zulai yesterday. According to him, Zhangyuan Swimming Pool (ie, the Mainland Swimming Pool) will continue to open this year and is currently under preparation.

### Erratic Changes Daily: Gold Shops Purchase Jin Gang to Cover Short Positions; Break Through the 25,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's spot gold market was dull and volatile, with the rising trend becoming increasingly fierce, and prices soared to beyond the 25,000 yuan mark. Cash shops and some brokers were forced to purchase to meet customer demand. In addition, the Tianjin Gang, which had been heavily selling for a long time, suddenly covered short positions. From the opening of the market in the morning, each tael (ten liang) broke through 24,000 yuan amidst buying pressure, reaching 24,500 yuan, an increase of 1,100 yuan. It then reached 24,600 yuan. Securities firms sold on behalf of the Tianjin Gang, and gold shops also sold, causing a drop of 500 yuan to 24,100 yuan. Soon after, two securities firms aggressively bought, indicating that the Tianjin Gang was covering short positions. Some brokers, cash shops, and retail investors joined in the buying frenzy, pushing the price up by 1,200 yuan to an unprecedented high of 25,300 yuan at 10:30 am amidst rumors of favorable news. Another securities firm and a gold shop sold at 25,000 yuan to meet the orders of limit-price buyers.

### Consistent Expectations for High Prices; Gaochang Single Yarn Only Buying, Not Selling; Yesterday It Rose to 6,730 Yuan

The cotton yarn market continued to surge with increasing tension. This was due to the expectation of high prices and consistent buying on dips, resulting in a shortage of chips. 4-count Blue Phoenix was at 10,400 to 10,600 yuan, 4-count Yanghe was at 10,900 yuan, 60-count Blue Phoenix was at 19,000 yuan, 60-count Lima was at 18,800 yuan, 42-count Shuiyue was at 17,700 yuan, 60-count Caiqiu was at 19,800 yuan, 40-count Caiqiu was at 9,500 yuan, 32-count Xiantao was at 8,700 yuan, 13-count Baoguang was at 7,800 yuan, 20-count Baoguang was at 6,000 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix was at 6,500 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was at 6,000 yuan, 20-count Fengnian was at 6,100 yuan, 20-count Shuiyue was at 6,100 yuan, 20-count Tejincheng was at 5,900 yuan, 20-count Yuta was at 5,620 yuan, 10-count Xiantao was at 6,000 yuan, 20-count Shuangma was at 6,050 to 6,220 yuan, 16-count Hongkui was at 5,600 yuan, 10-count Hongbao Yi was at 4,800 yuan, 10-count Hong Shuangma was at 4,800 yuan, 10-count Tongzijun was at 4,515 yuan, 10-count Shuangma was at 4,800 yuan.

Subsequently, the factory published a statement stating that if those holding fraudulent warehouse receipts did not come to pick up the goods by July 1, they would be charged an additional 12 yuan per piece for warehouse rent. As a result, speculators were forced to buy, leading to a huge amount of buying. Since there was only an increase in warehouse rent without other issues, the price surged to 6,730 yuan at closing. The trading price outside the market did not change much.

### Cotton Cloth Buying Enthusiasm Strong; Dongpi Closed at a High Price... Heavy-Pound Fine Cloth Relatively Dull

Factory cloth: The market yesterday continued to rise due to the rising yarn prices. All cloths generally rose, but heavy-pound coarse cloth was relatively dull. 16-pound Earth opened at 205 yuan, but did not sell. Later, it traded at 210 yuan. Feihong was at 207 yuan, up 4 yuan. 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth was at 194 yuan, Dapeng was at 190 yuan, Fugui factory single was at 192 yuan, spot goods were at 185 yuan, and the general spread was about 10 yuan.

### Public Bonds Rose by 4 Yuan to the Limit

The public bond black market surged again by 4 yuan to the limit yesterday. The high price has exceeded the highest price in June 1937, an unprecedented miracle in the history of the Unified Public Bonds. Grade A has reached above 90 yuan, which is inevitably rising too violently and is beyond common sense. If an unexpected storm is encountered, the fall will also be like that. Because there are too many spot goods scattered in various places, if the front line shakes slightly, it will cause a ripple effect. Rapid advances and rapid retreats are also common sense. No matter how strong the holders are, they cannot suddenly encounter unexpected storms. The environment is such that it has created this situation. Although it is now worrying about the future, it is still necessary to guard against it. Be mindful of misfortune in times of happiness, as the ancients said. Yesterday, the buyers Tongyuan, Changji, Tongkang, Zhenhua, Yongkang, Chengkang, Hongda, Lianyi, and Lida tried their best to pull up the price amidst the surge of selling from Tongli, Hu Heji, Xinji, Xinhua, Tongshun, Hengfu, Jiufeng, and Hongxing, but they still pulled up the price to the limit after several struggles. Whether it was manipulation by the buyers, it is not敢 to say. As a result, the market price rose by 4 yuan to the limit after seven consecutive days of gains. The turnover was more than 3 million yuan. Here is a simple table: Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day Unified A 45.80 44.00 45.60 +4.00 Unified B 44.40 40.70 44.40 +4.00 Unified C 44.00 41.00 44.00 +4.00 Unified D 40.80 40.80 44.00 +4.00 Unified E 41.00 39.50 43.00 +4.00

High-end overcoat wool fabrics, suit flannels, shoe felt, etc. of real origin are not willing to sell by large and small stores, which has led to high wool fabric prices. High-grade overcoat wool fabrics, suit flannels, shoe felt, etc. of real origin are not willing to sell by large and small stores, which has led to high wool fabric prices.

### Dim Prospects for Soap Distribution

The price of daily necessities rises without end. Soap prices have surged again, with rumors circulating that factories are shipping stockpiles to Southeast Asia, leaving little hope for distribution in Shanghai. This has further agitated the public. The current prices are: "Gu Ben" soap at 320 yuan, "Huang Xiang Mao" soap at 150 yuan, "Bai Xiang Mao" soap at 275 yuan, and "Jian Dao" (Arrow Knife) soap at 270 yuan, representing an increase of approximately 15 yuan compared to the previous day. Matches are slightly more briskly traded, with "Phoenix Brand" at 3,700 yuan, "Mei Li Brand" (Beauty Brand) at 3,800 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,700 yuan. "Bai Li Shi" (Price's) candles are at 130 yuan and "Seng Mao Brand" (Monk's Hat Brand) candles at 120 yuan, with no significant changes. The above prices are in terms of Central Reserve Bank notes.

Spring and Autumn

### Between Husband and Wife

— Jin Yi

Every day, when flipping through the newspaper and seeing that zinc-plate character "鈺" (Yu), I always thought it was some kind of advertisement and never paid attention to it. One day, feeling extremely bored, after finishing reading the news, I suddenly patiently read the words under that character "鈺"; after reading it, it seemed to spark a bit of interest, so I flipped through old newspapers and read the content related to the character "鈺" in detail.

After that Mr. Yin's "鈺" left home, every word he wrote was filled with tears. If that Ms. "鈺" also read the newspaper every day, I think she would at least be a little moved, and perhaps one day she would suddenly return and throw herself back into Mr. Yin's arms, reuniting the "broken mirror," which, whether familiar or not, would make everyone want to breathe a sigh of relief for them.

The emotions between husband and wife are elusive. Some couples' emotions may seem very淡薄(dan bo, lukewarm), but they respect each other like honored guests and never have any quarrels. Other couples' emotions may seem like they are as sticky as lacquer, but they will separate at the slightest disagreement. How were Mr. Yin and "鈺's" daily emotions? What conflicts led to each going to extremes? We have no way of knowing, so the question of who is right and who is wrong is secondary. The first thing to study is how this final state of affairs was brought about. We cannot deny, of course, that economic and family and social environments all contribute to the loss of affection between husband and wife. But since they are husband and wife, they can always see cracks in their relationship. If these "cracks" can be mended, they should be mended as soon as possible. Otherwise, the cracks will only grow bigger and bigger, and after a "fait accompli" is created, thinking about ways to remedy the situation is like trying to cut down a cassia tree, a futile effort?

Judging from Mr. Yin's advertisement, "economics" is probably not the issue, and the influence of the "environment" seems very small. Therefore, the cause of this unfortunate incident is probably related to the failure to prevent it in advance. Otherwise, we are now reluctant to place any blame on Mr. Yin and "鈺," because the faults are newly generated at the same time.

### On Heroes

— Qing

Most ordinary Chinese citizens have read folk novels such as "Water Margin" and "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants." Even if they are illiterate, they can understand the comic strips. As a result, the "hero" ideology fills the minds of every ordinary citizen. As long as you walk on the streets, "hero" stories can be seen everywhere.

Several years ago, newspapers often published news of "a robber shot to death." Although the robbers' tricks were different, the uniform depiction was always of someone "wildly drinking two large cups of sorghum wine and singing Peking opera tunes," or "shouting before execution, 'Ten years later, I will be a good man again!'"

Undeniably, these are "heroes" who have been influenced by "Water Margin" and "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants"! "Chinese-style" "heroes."

Someone said: Doesn't Lu Xun's "Ah Q" also embody a "Chinese-style" hero? He not only "will be a good man again in ten years," but also drinks wine, and most importantly, he can sing "Holding a steel pen, I will hit you!"

The era of "Water Margin" and "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" has passed, and the era of "Ah Q" has also passed. Shouldn't the "hero" be a different kind now?

Flipping through yesterday's newspaper, all newspapers prominently published the news of the "execution of the notorious robber Xia Jinbiao" with large headlines. Because we haven't read this kind of news for a long time, one cannot help but read it carefully. However, after reading it carefully, one cannot help but feel something. It's not that the death of a person makes me feel unhappy, but that I feel that the "Chinese-style" "hero" is still inherited. After hundreds and thousands of years, the appearance of the "hero" has not changed much.

The news wrote: "...When the chief arrested criminal Xia Jinbiao, Xia's attitude turned mad. He stood upright before the case and immediately read the death sentence. The murderer Xia Jinbiao, after giving his name, age, and origin, said that he had violated the national law and deserved the death penalty. He asked them to inform his wife to come and collect his body. After speaking, he sang Peking opera loudly and walked into the execution ground to await execution..."

It cannot be denied that this is a "hero." However, this kind of "hero" was common in the local news columns ten years ago, and also common in the local news columns twenty years ago. "Ah Q" was such a type, and there were many in "Water Margin" and "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants." There will still be no shortage of them in the future. Don't you see seven- or eight-year-old children, similarly rolling up their sleeves and saying, "This body wasn't rented!"

Alas, there are so many "heroes," but they are all "heroes" who cannot save themselves!

### Reading

— Tian

We must love books and read books, but we must not be indiscriminate. — Anatole France

You may have read many books, but you will still be as ignorant as you were before you read books, unless you turn all the words into images you have obtained by observing nature in your mind. — Voltaire

Some books should be tasted lightly; some books should be swallowed whole; and a few books should be chewed carefully and digested. — Bacon

### "Halving" and "Doubling"

— Pan Shan (Staggering)

Amidst the noise of the reform of the new and old currency systems, some small financial employees are busy. For the sake of the corresponding conversions, they have worked overtime more than once, and now they are even busier exchanging the new legal tender, so busy that they hate that their parents didn't give them two more pairs of hands. And their gains? It's really miserable; even their own salaries have gone through a statutory conversion by their own hands!

Running onto the street and looking at the glass windows of major companies, just like a few days ago, the original prices have not changed, but there are extra words "Central Reserve Bank notes" or "CRB." This stunned me.

One side is "halving," and the other side is "doubling" or "multiplying." Isn't this crushing the salaried class in the middle?

For the sake of stabilizing the lives of most people, it is hoped that attention will be paid to this.

### A Story of Treating Guests

— Zhong Wenling

Treating guests is not very common for me. When it happens, it is mostly others who treat me. As for treating others, it can probably be counted on the fingers of one hand in my life (and one hand is enough). Not reciprocating is impolite, so sometimes I simply don't go when others invite me.

This afternoon, a special event occurred, and for the sake of maintaining relationships, it seemed that I had to treat them, and it was best to do it that day.

While working at my desk, my mind was filled with calculations, almost like rehearsing a play. Characters: one host (myself), three guests (two locals, one Cantonese). Time: around 7:00 PM. Location: This was a difficult decision. What restaurant? Cantonese, Jiangsu, Fujian, or Shanghai cuisine? Da San Yuan, Zheng Xing Guan, Shi Yi Lou... No, none of them are right. I heard that going to a restaurant is very dangerous, because everything is at "market price," and you can easily "eat through the table" (not having enough money in your pocket to pay the bill on the table). Oh, I've got it, eating Western food is the safest. The price for each guest for lunch is fixed, and the price for each guest for dinner is fixed, with a price list posted, and dishes are served one by one according to the order. After eating, you pay the bill and there are no surprises. However, the problem is the price, which varies from place to place, and the exact location is yet to be determined, and it is time to leave work.

After 5:00 PM, I wandered back and forth on Fuzhou Road, intending to compare restaurant prices. But strangely, all the price lists in front of the restaurants were gone. I ran to Sichuan Road, but the situation was the same. Suddenly, I looked up and saw the sign of a restaurant, and I remembered having been there once. At that time, dinner was 12 yuan, and now it may have increased in price, maybe up by 5 yuan, which would be 17 yuan, multiplied by four, which is 68 yuan. Since I have a hundred and several tens of yuan in my pocket, it should be more than enough, so the location was "internally decided."

After 7:00 PM, I ran into the restaurant and saw a colorful paper strip posted on the wall: Dinner is 15 yuan per guest in the new legal tender. A burst of heat went through my body, and my glasses were fogged up by the steam. I took them off, wiped them with a handkerchief, and put them back on, but the price was still 15 yuan per guest in the new legal tender. Immediately, I listed a calculation formula in my mind: 15 times 2 equals 30, 4 times 30 equals 120!

My friend next to me asked, "Is it very hot?"

"Yes," I said, "It's so hot that I'm getting a fever." I kept wiping my sweat with a handkerchief.

The waiter led us to a "train seat." After sitting down, I felt a little more settled. Looking up, I saw the two large letters "UB" pasted on the wall, painted bright red, seeming to have endless allure. I quickly turned my head, not daring to look again. I took the initiative and said, "Now that we're seated, it doesn't feel so hot."

I tremblingly finished the most unpleasant dinner. What was said and what was heard during the meal, even I myself couldn't understand.

### Sunglasses

— Kuang Cheng

Sunglasses are displayed again in the windows of optical shops. The lowest price is 20 yuan. The outer lenses that used to cost 50 cents now cost more than ten yuan.

The weather is getting hot, and the strong sunlight is dazzling, but there are not many people wearing sunglasses on the streets now. Perhaps everyone is embracing the principle of "saving wherever possible."

In previous years, when going out in the summer, most people took a car. Although the sunlight was strong, it didn't matter much. This year, there are more days of walking, and without sunglasses, it seems inconvenient to walk in the hot sun. Yesterday, I went to an optical shop to ask, and the poor quality ones were unwilling to sell, and the better ones were asking for 50 yuan. I didn't have that much spare money, so I had to give up.

Some people say that wearing sunglasses is a feature of the city, and not many people really need them. Most of the fashionable people, in order to show off, don't care whether they are good for the eyes or not, and they have to buy even inferior ones.

A few years ago, even small optical shops could sell more than two thousand pairs of basic sunglasses costing one yuan each year. Upper-class young men and women also frequented them. They not only took pride in wearing sunglasses, but also often boasted to others, "These glasses of mine are worth dozens of yuan!"

People who don't usually wear glasses and buy sunglasses with bad lenses will not get used to them at all. After wearing them, they feel dizzy, and they put too much strain on their eyes, which is even more uncomfortable than the sun shining on the moon. Friends with nearsightedness who wear sunglasses with inaccurate prescriptions find things even blurrier, which is also harmful to their eyesight.

It is said that the lenses of sunglasses should not be completely black, and those with light blue or light yellow are very inappropriate. It is best to choose light green ones.

Therefore, many people wear sunglasses for the sake of beauty and do not pay attention to the lenses. They are not cautious beforehand, which is not only unhygienic but also harmful to their eyesight. Only a few people wear sunglasses to protect their eyes.

In the city, many young people have the habit of being fashionable. They have to try things that are popular for a while, regardless of whether they are beneficial to themselves or not. Sometimes, they know it's a waste, but they don't care.

Everyone thinks that wearing sunglasses is to show off, and they forget the purpose of wearing sunglasses. Summer hasn't even arrived yet, and some people are already wearing them. Summer is over, and some people are still wearing them. Even on gloomy days, some people are wearing them on the bridge of their noses.

Today, sunglasses costing dozens of yuan are selling less. Those who need them often can't get them, and those who treat them as decorations have to calculate the money in their pockets. In this day and age, showing off is not easy!

### Sharing the Boat in the Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Reciprocity

Qin Runzhi really went to great lengths, maneuvering between Fei Changhe and Wei Cheng in a short two hours. Wei Cheng said, "If he wants money, I will reluctantly scrape together some for him; if he wants someone, I will take him to Shanghai to find them, but I have to wait for my aunt to come back." Runzhi said, "He naturally wants money. He may say he doesn't, but in his heart, he wants money. Even if he doesn't want money in his heart, he is forced to want it by circumstances. Young Master Ye, you pay him in small amounts, thirty yuan today, fifty yuan tomorrow. I feel bad for Young Master Ye's money. It's better to give him three hundred yuan and not allow him to ask for more money within a year. Have him write a note, put a fingerprint on it, and I, Qin Runzhi, will be the intermediary. It's not that I think Young Master Ye has a lot of money and am helping Young Master Ye waste it. It's really because he is a local thug, and you are a young master. It has never been done to have a young master argue with a thug about right and wrong and haggle over money."

Wei Cheng exclaimed in surprise "Three hundred!", Qin Runzhi smiled and said, "Three hundred, what's that? Young Master Ye, you are buying peace of mind for yourself. You are buying a year without having to meet with a thug. It's actually cheap." Wei Cheng thought, Sister Cuizhen has worked hard and made great contributions to my family. This three hundred yuan can be considered as wages paid to Sister Cuizhen; even if it's not wages, it should be said that it is my respect for Sister Cuizhen. Thinking this way, he generously agreed and went to the bedroom to scrape together three hundred yuan. Walking across the courtyard, A Xing and A Ma waved from under the eaves of the house, calling for the young master. Wei Cheng said, "This is none of your business." He returned to the Shuangmei Study. Qin Runzhi was already writing a note that was neither coherent nor clear. The main condition on the note was that Fei Changhe would not ask Young Master Ye for any more money within a year, that this was voluntary, and that he would not go back on his word. Wei Cheng suggested changing "within a year" to "forever." Qin Runzhi smiled at Wei Cheng's ear, "Young Master Ye, don't refute these words. After he puts his fingerprint on it, I will secretly add a stroke to change the one into a ten. After ten years, by the time this fellow's bones have turned to drumsticks, what are we afraid he will do?" Wei Cheng did not refute him at the time. After the note was officially established, Wei Cheng's money was in Fei Changhe's hands. Fei Changhe pointed to it and said, "Change this 'one year' character to a capital '壹' character, to prevent people from changing it." Wei Cheng wanted to show that he was a gentleman, so he was willing for the note's effect to only be one year. (100)

### Zongzi (Rice Dumplings)

— Ming Yan

Zongzi are on the market again.

Seeing that the Dragon Boat Festival is just around the corner, and zongzi is a delicacy to eat during this holiday, although the price is very expensive, everyone wants to buy some to taste, so as not to waste this festive season.

This year, not only does glutinous rice sell for seven or eight hundred yuan per dan (a unit of weight), but even zongzi leaves are frighteningly expensive. Cooking zongzi requires a lot of heat, and coal and firewood are expensive, which is very uneconomical. Some time ago, the Public Works Department sold foreign glutinous rice, and many people went to buy it to keep for wrapping zongzi. At that time, each sheng (a unit of volume) of foreign rice only sold for one yuan. Storing it until now means that you can eat a zongzi for only two or three mao (a unit of currency). This is because you must have a spirit of "preparing for a rainy day" to enjoy the pleasure of eating!

When chatting with friends, everyone said that even eating rice is difficult, let alone zongzi. One person, who was occasionally in high spirits, spent five yuan to buy two zongzi, but after eating them, he suddenly felt a lot of pain, and he dared not taste the new ones again after that.

Folk customs are like this. Everyone values ​​this day. Eating zongzi during the Dragon Boat Festival is said to be in memory of Qu Yuan. This ill-fated great poet threw himself into the Miluo River and died. Later generations mourned him and used bamboo tubes to store rice, which was thrown into the water on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month to worship him. Later, no one was willing to do this kind of ritual, and zongzi became a seasonal food. Therefore, some people think that if zongzi were only attached to as a sacrificial offering and could not be eaten by people, this custom would probably have been cancelled long ago and would not have been passed down to today.
