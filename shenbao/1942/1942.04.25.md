Tokyo, 24th (Domei News Agency): Foreign Minister Togo stated in his address at the 20th annual meeting of the Japan Economic Federation yesterday, "The Soviet Union is very wise and will not be used by Britain and the United States to 'pull chestnuts out of the fire.'" The "Asahi Shimbun" commented this morning, saying that there is no reason for Japan and the Soviet Union to engage in conflict and that the hope of Britain and the United States to use the Soviet Union as a puppet in the war against Japan is hopeless. "Nichinichi Shimbun" also adopted a similar tone and hoped that the Soviet authorities would order Ambassador Smirnov, who is currently on leave in the Soviet Union, to return to his post as soon as possible.

Iran's Internal Unrest; The Government Is Making Every Effort to Quell the Rebellion

Tehran, 23rd (Havas): Deputy Minister of War Liyeqi stated in his speech to Parliament today, "Iran is currently going through the most chaotic period. Rebellions are occurring throughout the country. The National Army is searching and suppressing the rebels everywhere. Hundreds of wounded soldiers are sent to hospitals every day." The Prime Minister of Iran continued to speak, saying that the work he is undertaking has encountered difficulties. Members of Parliament often speak annoyingly to me. This attitude only has a negative impact on the military and the people. According to recent political developments, order throughout the country has been lost. Under such circumstances, I can hardly continue my work. Gentlemen, you do not cherish the soldiers who sacrifice themselves for the independence of the motherland. I know that every country has traitors, but at least they do not dare to act openly."

### Turkey Is Determined to Maintain Neutrality; Resolutely Determined; Maintains Friendly Relations with Britain and Germany; Striving to Prevent the Spread of War to the Near East

Istanbul, 23rd (Havas): National Assembly member Sadak published an article in "Ak≈üam" today, stating that Turkey is extremely determined to strictly adhere to neutrality and that Turkey is determined to maintain friendly relations with both Britain and Germany at the same time. So far, Turkey has no reason to lose the friendship of Britain. In terms of relations with Germany, which were originally very friendly, they have become even more satisfactory since the signing of the commercial agreement. In the current phase of the war, Turkey is not an obstacle to Germany's advance, which is one point. Britain benefits from Turkey's determination to prevent the spread of war to the Near East, which is the second point. Therefore, Turkey consistently hopes that the current war will not involve it.

Soviet-Turkish Relations Remain Tense

Istanbul, 23rd (Havas): After the assassination attempt on German Ambassador Papen in Turkey, two Soviet citizens were also detained for questioning as suspects. As a result, relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey suddenly became tense.

### Iran Under British and Soviet Control

Looking at a map of the Near East, one can clearly understand the situation in Iran. It borders the Soviet Union to the north, India to the east, Turkey to the west, and faces the Arabian Sea to the south. Militarily, it is extremely important for the British and Soviet war prospects. Since British and Soviet forces have controlled the entire Iran, its foreign policy has had to gradually adopt a clear attitude. If Turkey were to have an incident, Iran's future would be seriously affected. (Top image) The terrain of Alwand Mountain, was an ancient battlefield over a thousand years ago.

Wellington, 23rd (Havas): Prime Minister Fraser recently stated in a speech that New Zealand and its affiliated islands, including the Fiji Islands, have been incorporated into the "South Pacific Theater" and are subject to the command of the U.S. Navy Headquarters. "The Australian Commonwealth is already under the command of the famous American General Macarthur. Our country welcomes establishing closer ties with it, but from a military strategic point of view, it seems inappropriate. After discussions among the governments of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand, it was finally decided to adopt another approach. In other words, New Zealand will be incorporated into the "South Pacific Theater," and the parties involved are still discussing the issue of how to further cooperate between Australia and New Zealand.

Special Issue on the Indian Question

### 7. Transportation in India (Continued)

Bombay Railway Network

There are four railway lines departing from Bombay that lead to the interior: The first line goes north to Baroda and the Indian capital New Delhi, and connects with trains in that area to reach Punjab Province and Northwest India. This is the Bombay Baroda Railway and the Central India Railway. The second line passes through the Thal Ghat mountain pass in the Western Ghats, reaches the city of Khandwa in the central region, and then goes north to Allahabad. This is the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. In Allahabad, it connects with the East Indian Railway, which leads directly down the Ganges River valley to Calcutta. This is one of the direct routes from Bombay to Calcutta. Calcutta is located on the east bank of the Hooghly River, and the train stops at Howrah Station on the west bank of the river. Howrah and Calcutta are connected by a long bridge, spanning the Hooghly River, which is quite spectacular. The third line starts at the same point as the second line, but after the railway enters the central region, it goes directly to Nagpur. This is also the main line of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. In Nagpur, the railway connects with the Bengal Nagpur Railway, which leads to Howrah. Taking this route from Bombay to Calcutta is closer than the second line. The fourth line goes southeast, passes through the Western Ghats to reach Pune, and then reaches Madras via Hyderabad. The above four lines are all broad-gauge railways.

Madras Railway Network

There are also four railway lines starting from Madras: The first line goes north from Madras, then turns northeast, and goes north along the coast. This railway passes through two large rivers, the Krishna River and the Godavari River, with broad and magnificent railway bridges built over the rivers. Near Visakhapatnam, it connects with the Bengal Nagpur Railway, and the terminus is also Calcutta (Howrah). The second line goes northwest to Raichur, and connects with the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which is a direct route to Bombay. This line has already been mentioned above. The third line is the South Indian Railway, which goes west through the Palghat Gap to reach the west coast, and goes north to Mangalore. There is a branch line here that goes north to Calicut. The line going south from Madras is another main line of the South Indian Railway. This is a meter-gauge railway that leads directly to Tuticorin at the southern tip of the peninsula. This railway goes from Tiruchirappalli to Dhanushkodi, where a small steamer crosses the 22-mile-long shallow strait, connecting with the train in Ceylon.

There are other railways on the peninsula part of India. One railway leads to Goa, a Portuguese colony on the west coast.

Calcutta Railway Network

Calcutta and Howrah are separated by the Hooghly River. Before 1932, there were no bridges connecting them, and people only used flat-bottomed boats to cross the river. Howrah rose because all the railways ended here. In 1932, the magnificent Willingdon Bridge was completed. Part of the bridge is a highway, and part is a railway. Because this bridge is built several miles north of Calcutta, although there is a railway connecting the two places, the major railways still use Howrah as the terminus. There are three main railway lines starting in Calcutta and Howrah: The East Bengal Railway crosses the Ganges River and can reach all parts of Bengal. It is broad gauge south of the Ganges, with a magnificent railway bridge spanning the Ganges at Sara Ghat, but the tracks north of the Ganges have become one meter wide. The locomotives and passenger cars behind are not suitable for use north of the river, and passengers must change trains when crossing the river. The East Bengal Railway is interrupted by major rivers in at least five places. The rivers are wide and cannot be spanned by railway bridges, so trains have to be transported across the river to maintain contact. The East Indian Railway connects Calcutta with the cities in the Ganges River valley. This line goes from Calcutta to Delhi and Ambala. In Ambala, it connects with the Northwest Railway, which leads to Lahore and Northwest Frontier Province. In addition to connecting the major cities on the south bank of the Ganges River, such as Patna, Benares, Allahabad, Kanpur, and Agra, the East Indian Railway also transports goods for the coal mines in the western Bay of Bengal. The Bengal Nagpur Railway is another broad-gauge railway. The main line goes directly from Calcutta to Nagpur, and from Nagpur, the Great Indian Peninsula Railway leads to Bombay. Another main line goes south along the coast to Madras.

Starting from Karachi, the fourth largest city in India, the Northwest Railway leads directly to Hyderabad in Sindh Province (India has two Hyderabad cities, one belonging to Hyderabad Province on the peninsula part, and the other belonging to Sindh Province in the northwest). From Hyderabad, there are several branch lines. One branch line passes through the Indian Desert, reaches the Jodhpur region, and connects with the Bombay Baroda Railway and the Central India Railway. Before reaching Jodhpur, there is a station that allows passengers to go directly to Bombay. Another branch line goes north from Hyderabad to the Indus River valley to reach Punjab. There is another branch line that crosses the Indus River north to Quetta, a city near the Afghan border.

Air Routes

India's air traffic has regular flights to Europe and Britain, carrying passengers and mail, shortening the journey between Europe and Asia by an unknown amount. India is an indispensable stop on the air route from London to Australia. Royal Airways flies from London, passing through Karachi, Delhi, Allahabad, Calcutta, Rangoon, to Singapore. It only takes six days to fly from London to Rangoon. Another air route flies from Karachi, passing through Bombay to Madras. Karachi is the meeting point of three major air routes and is the most important air station in India.

### The Soviet Union Assembles the Nation's Strength; Preparing to Fight Germany to the Finish; German Troops Massed in the Southern Sector Awaiting Orders; Fierce Air Battle in Murmansk

London, 24th (Reuters): After General Anders, Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army in the Soviet Union, arrived here from the Near East, he told reporters yesterday that the German spring offensive will concentrate its efforts on attacking the central and southern sectors of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is fully prepared to deal with it. Although the upcoming German offensive will not be as fierce as last year's offensive, it will definitely use all its strength to make a desperate gamble. The Soviet Union is also well aware of this. In short, both Germany and the Soviet Union believe that this year will be the decisive year. The Soviet Union also believes that opening a second front is crucial to the victory or defeat of the war.

Stockholm, Switzerland, 24th (Havas): As the winter war is about to end, the Red Army authorities seem to have taken various steps to meet the various needs of the spring war in order to continue to maintain an offensive strategy. According to Soviet statements, the country will maintain its initiative at any cost. At the same time, the May Day Labor Day is approaching, and the Soviet Union will hold grand celebrations across the country. Red Army leaders may take this opportunity to inspire the Soviet people.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 23rd (Havas): According to Soviet sources, German troops have massed in some areas of the Eastern Front, especially in the southern sector, preparing to launch an offensive.

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency): The German High Command announced that German aircraft attacked Murmansk fiercely on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, with considerable results. On Wednesday night, German bombers passed through the Soviet anti-aircraft fire net and went straight to the sky above the harbor, dropping many bombs. The port facilities were severely damaged. The next morning, German Stuka dive bombers continued to bomb Murmansk in batches. The accompanying German fighters encountered Soviet fighters that took off to intercept them. After a brief exchange of fire, the Soviets lost nine planes. The Germans had only one fighter that did not return.

Soviet Troops Achieve Victory in the Central Sector

Moscow, 24th (Reuters): The Soviet Information Bureau's midday supplement reported that Soviet troops had captured a heavily fortified village in a certain area of the Kalinin Front. German troops in another village were also driven out by a Soviet cavalry unit. German troops in another area of the Kalinin Front launched a counterattack in the past two days, but were repelled. The Soviet midday supplement also stated, "Nothing major happened on the front line on the night of April 23."

Situation on the Finnish Front

Helsinki, 24th (Havas): After the Finnish General Headquarters issued a communique yesterday describing the aftermath of the Svir River battle, newspapers here believed that the Soviet Union was eager to improve its formation before the arrival of spring in Northern Europe in order to remove the threat to its right flank. Therefore, the battle for the Svir River is extremely important.

Milan, Italy, 23rd (Havas): "Corriere della Sera" on the Eastern Front recently published an article by a war correspondent in the northern sector, describing the situation on the Finnish front in detail. The article stated that the Soviet command recently selected Siberian troops, taught them how to fight in marshy areas, and sent them to the Olonets Isthmus and the Svir River basin, obviously intending to take advantage of the melting ice and snow and the muddy roads, which made it difficult for Finnish troops to supply and transport supplies, to make a surprising move. However, the Finnish General Headquarters has been constantly sending reinforcements to the front line since mid-March, so it was not taken advantage of. According to Soviet prisoners of war and espionage, the main Soviet target is to attack the Olonets Isthmus, so the Finnish authorities have taken defensive measures on the southern front and near Lake Ladoga. In terms of marsh warfare, the soldiers wade through water up to their waists. Soviet tanks advancing show only the tips of their observation towers above the mud. The Finnish army responds with mobile units, and all the soldiers bravely carry out flanking attacks or raids on the rear of the Soviet army, so that the Soviet army cannot take care of both ends. The Finnish army often cuts off the connection between Soviet tanks and infantry assault teams, forcing the Soviet army to abandon its rapid offensive plan and return to defend its flanks and rear.

### Germany Claims Atlantic Coast Defenses Are Exceptionally Solid, British Troops Attempt Landing on Opposite Shore, Berlin Announces Engagement Details

Reuters, Brussels, 24th - Captain Schuland, a German war correspondent, recently published an article in the Brussels Daily for the first time, detailing the construction of German defenses along the Atlantic coast since the spring of 1940. He stated that after occupying the western coast, German forces positioned heavy naval and land artillery at key points, and construction of artillery positions began. This project was overseen by experts who had built the West Wall. The artillery positions had four main features:

*   "Heavy Artillery": The coastal points were primarily defended by heavy naval and land artillery, supplemented by mobile railway guns tasked with repelling any attacking enemy fleet. Numerous medium and light guns also provided resistance against assault.

*   "Deep and Wide Defense Zone": The entire coastline had been transformed into a deeply and widely organized defense zone, incorporating infantry lines and land-air defense systems capable of controlling enemy attacks.

*   "Mobile Defense": Defensive troops were primarily trained for mobility. Mobile reserve units and motorized units could be dispatched to threatened areas at any time, with large tank units forming the core.

*   "Vigilant Patrols": Naval and air patrols operated day and night. Continuous short- and long-range aerial reconnaissance was conducted. All ship movements in the British North Sea and Atlantic were within German sight. Consequently, a large-scale enemy landing was impossible. Any enemy attempt to exploit the cover of darkness for a sudden landing, as the Japanese had done in the Far East, had no possibility of success.

Reuters, Berlin, 24th - The German High Command detailed an attempted British landing at Boulogne, stating that enemy soldiers were discovered as they were cutting coastal barbed wire. The enemy fired rifles and machine guns into the darkness. Based on the muzzle flashes, their numbers were estimated at around fifty. Soon after, German coastal defense forces used searchlights to locate the enemy. Machine guns opened fire. The British troops hurriedly retreated to two speedboats moored about one hundred meters from the shore. Their escape route was revealed by smoke screens. German speedboats soon arrived, and the enemy boats accelerated away. The following morning, a large number of rifles, grenades, and mine-laying equipment left behind by the enemy were found outside the coastal barbed wire. Bloodstains were also present on the beach, indicating that several enemy soldiers had been wounded by gunfire. The British troops‚Äô presence on the land lasted only eight minutes.

### Germany Mobilizes Manpower to Increase Wartime Production; Students to Engage in Agricultural Work

Havas, Berne, Switzerland, 23rd - According to a dispatch from a Berlin correspondent of the National Daily, German authorities have recently taken new measures to thoroughly mobilize all manpower in the mainland and occupied territories, in order to maximize wartime production. One of the new measures is to mobilize male and female students to participate in agricultural work. It is reported that Mr. Sacker, a member of the Manpower Mobilization Committee, has begun negotiations with relevant parties to determine the dates of school closures for various schools or grades, so that students can engage in agricultural work as needed between April 15th and November 15th. Supervision of the children will be provided by schoolteachers or members of the National Socialist Youth League. In addition, German authorities also plan to use a large number of Red Army prisoners of war for cultivation, but transportation is proving difficult.

### British and German Air Forces Bomb Each Other; Danzig Attacked for the First Time

Reuters, London, 24th - British aircraft attacked Rostock, a German port on the Baltic Sea, last night. The city's major industries include fishing, machinery, sugar production, and chemicals. It has a population of about 120,000. This morning at breakfast time, two German aircraft attacked a town on the southeastern coast of England, causing damage to buildings and resulting in casualties.

Reuters, Berlin, 24th - It has been learned that British bomber groups attacked the northern coast of Germany last night. Slight damage was caused to private property, and a few civilians were killed or injured. Four enemy aircraft were shot down. Only one aircraft reached the suburbs of Berlin, but ultimately it was unable to drop its bombs due to intense anti-aircraft fire and fled.

Reuters, Berlin, 24th - According to responsible sources here, German aircraft bombed various ports on the southern coast of England last night, causing fires to break out in various places. German aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights yesterday and obtained important intelligence in Scotland.

Havas, Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd - Yesterday, British aircraft flew to Denmark and attacked Copenhagen. This was the first air raid on the city since Denmark fell on July 30, 1940. The city authorities issued an alert at 12:30 PM yesterday, which was lifted after an hour and a half.

Reuters, London, 24th - It has been officially announced that 105 German aircraft were shot down by British fighters and anti-aircraft guns in the past three months. Ninety of these were shot down during the day (79 while operating over German territory), and the remaining 15 were shot down at night. The British lost a total of 61 aircraft.

### Large Numbers of German Troops Reinforce Norway; Norwegian Prime Minister Visits Washington

Reuters, Vichy, 24th - The Basler National-Zeitung's Stockholm correspondent reports that Germany is currently sending large numbers of troops to reinforce Norway. The widespread belief that British guerrilla forces would soon launch large-scale attacks on the Norwegian coast has been confirmed by the significant reinforcements sent by the German occupation forces. According to widespread reports in Sweden, the German reinforcements consist primarily of armored divisions.

Reuters, New York, 24th - Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold arrived in New York yesterday and immediately proceeded to Washington. Mr. Nygaardsvold stated that he would stay in the United States for a month.

### Another Six Thousand French Prisoners Released

Havas, Paris, 24th - German authorities have recently released another 6,000 French prisoners of war. The first group is expected to arrive in Compiegne on April 28th.

### French Finance Minister Bouthillier Ordered to Raise Funds to Cover War Expenses; Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Cannot Be Balanced, Requiring Increased Taxes and the Issuance of Public Bonds

Havas, Vichy, 23rd - "Paris-Soir" recently reported that the new Finance Minister Bouthillier has been ordered to raise funds to cover the economic costs of the 1939 war and the burdens resulting from defeat. It is noted that in the period from the outbreak of the current war on September 1, 1939, to June 1940, less than a year, the French government spent a total of 263 billion francs, of which military expenditure accounted for 190 billion francs, and government expenses also reached 71 billion francs. After the signing of the armistice between France and Germany, France had to bear the responsibility of providing supplies to the German occupying forces in the occupied territories, requiring 400 million francs per day, which was later reduced to 300 million francs. In addition, the post-war reconstruction efforts are extremely costly, and annual revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced. Therefore, it is necessary to increase taxes, issue public bonds, and borrow from the Bank of France to make up for the shortfall. According to this analysis, the new Finance Minister's approach to raising funds should be to limit the issuance of banknotes as much as possible, as banknotes themselves have no practical use. The purchase of various essential goods has already been subject to rationing measures. It is impossible to buy bread without a bread ration card, and it is impossible to purchase real estate without the permission of the authorities.

Laval Receives Japanese Ambassador Mitani

Reuters, Vichy, 24th - French Prime Minister Laval received General Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Armed Forces, and Mitani, the new Japanese Ambassador to France, yesterday morning. In the afternoon, he continued to hold discussions with several close associates.

Reuters, Vichy, 24th - French Prime Minister Laval received Mitani, the new Japanese Ambassador to France, yesterday. Mitani is scheduled to meet Marshal P√©tain in the coming days to present his credentials.

### Japanese Forces Control Entire Island of Panay; Americans Adopt Scorched Earth Policy

Domei, Panay Island, 24th - Japanese forces on Panay Island have cleared out the remaining enemy forces, and transportation routes to Iloilo, San Jose, and Capiz Islands have been controlled. The remaining enemy forces in the mountains have also been subdued.

Domei, Panay Island, 24th - According to a powerful resident of Iloilo City, before the Japanese forces landed near Iloilo City on April 16th, about 250 American and Filipino troops in Iloilo City set fire to houses, causing two-thirds of the city, including the most prosperous areas, to be destroyed by fire. The American forces began requisitioning private cars, food, and other materials as early as December 22nd of last year. At the same time, they urged all non-essential residents to evacuate. Local English and Spanish newspapers, under American direction since January, intensified anti-Japanese propaganda. Furthermore, under American instigation in March, they promoted a scorched earth policy, resulting in many residents of Iloilo becoming homeless after Filipino and American troops set fire to more than a dozen places, including warehouses.

### MacArthur Employs Empty City Stratagem; A Retrospective on the Battle of Bataan

Dispatch from New York, 23rd - The Australian correspondent of the National Broadcasting Corporation today relayed a story from Major General George of the U.S. Army Air Corps, demonstrating how MacArthur cleverly used a small number of air force to defeat Japanese aircraft at Bataan. It is said that the Japanese army built a heavy bomber airfield 20 miles from the front line. At that time, we had no aircraft available. However, knowing that the Japanese often listened to our radio messages, George deliberately sent a wireless message to the airfield, and another end reported to George, ordering it to send (40) aircraft to attack the Japanese airfield. He pretended to reply that the components of one of the aircraft had malfunctioned. George then said that five aircraft would be fine. In fact, we had absolutely no aircraft. The Japanese really overheard the message, and the aircraft took off and fled. This happened for four consecutive days. On the fourth day, two newly arrived (1)(40) aircraft arrived, so the same method was used to first make the Japanese aircraft take to the air, and then wait for them to land before launching an attack.

### President Roosevelt Inherits Estate of One Million Dollars

Reuters, Lisbon, 24th - Mrs. Roosevelt passed away several months ago. President Roosevelt inherited an estate of $1,090,000 yesterday.

### U.S. President to Visit Canada Next Month to Discuss Military Cooperation

Havas, London, 23rd - Deputy Prime Minister and Colonial Secretary Major Attlee announced in the House of Commons that U.S. President Roosevelt is scheduled to travel to Ottawa next month to hold meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King. The United Kingdom will also send representatives to participate. The discussions will primarily focus on adjusting the training plans for Allied aviation personnel. He hoped that the members of the House would not make unnecessary criticisms, and they should not forget the sacrifices the government has made in the last two and a half months.

Reuters, Stockholm, Sweden, 24th - The question of whether Canadian soldiers can be sent to Europe or elsewhere (outside Canadian territory) to participate in the war will be decided by the Canadian people on the 27th of this month. While London is aware that Canadian Prime Minister King supports the deployment of troops, there are fears of opposition from "French Canadians" (descendants of the French), who make up about one-third of the Canadian population. If they are unwilling to cooperate, not only will the deployment of troops be affected, but Canada's military-industrial production will also inevitably suffer.

### Japan's Materials Mobilization Plan Approved by Cabinet

Domei, Tokyo, 24th - The Japanese government has been consulting and reviewing the materials mobilization plan for Showa 17 (1942) with the Planning Board and relevant ministries. It has now finalized the plan and submitted it for discussion at today's regular cabinet meeting. Suzuki, President of the Planning Board, Kishida, Minister of Commerce and Industry, and other relevant cabinet ministers explained the contents, and the plan was approved in its original form. The President of the Planning Board also issued a statement at noon, stating that the materials mobilization plan for Showa 17 was formulated with a focus on strengthening the absolutely necessary military expenditure for completing the Greater East Asia War. Special consideration was given to the following points:

1.  Past annual plans were divided into four quarters, and an implementation plan was determined based on the circumstances. This time, the previous approach has been changed, and the annual plan and the implementation plans for each of the four quarters are being formulated simultaneously. However, at least unavoidable revisions will be made during the implementation plan.
2.  In order to ensure supply capacity, separate vessel allocation plans for periods and materials will be set.
3.  Important materials are expected to be imported from the occupied areas in the south.
4.  In addition to directly producing military supplies such as steel and aluminum, preparations will be made to maintain food supplies, promote shipbuilding, and air defense.
5.  Plans for the supply and demand of essential consumer goods will be planned.
6.  Special consideration will be given to the supply and demand of petroleum products, with the hope of obtaining them from the occupied areas in the south.
7.  Based on the materials mobilization plan, a Greater East Asia Trade Plan will be set up to begin the construction of the co-prosperity sphere. To supply materials for Showa 17, all means will be used to increase domestic production, expect increased imports from China and Manchuria, obtain materials from the south, and utilize stored materials. This will significantly strengthen national power. However, when allocating these materials, the needs of officials and the public will inevitably still be slightly lacking due to the nature of the materials mobilization plan. However, in light of the essence of total war, the materials mobilization plan will also give special consideration to maintaining the wartime national life. In addition, when implementing this plan, other policies will be referred to in order to ensure proper execution. In short, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the materials mobilization plan must be appropriate and able to be implemented smoothly.

Zheng Ying, a 25-year-old young woman, currently residing at No. 18 New Village, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai, was married to Zhao Jiayou, who has already passed away. After her husband's death, Zheng was unwilling to remain single and began an affair with Zhu Linquan (25 years old) from Beixinjing, a disciple of her husband. Zhu also believed that there was no one in the Zhao family, so he often visited for secret meetings. However, the matter was discovered by Li Wenda, a local caretaker who had been hired by Zhao before his death. On the morning of the day before yesterday (22nd), Li, together with three other local people, Hu Er, Chen Guisheng, and others, went to Zheng's house. Zhu was still fast asleep in bed, so Li and others used a rope to strangle Zhu to death, then fled through the door without a trace. Later, Zheng reported the incident, and the inside story was revealed. It was discovered that the suspects Li Wenda and others were hiding in rooms No. 61 and No. 55 of the Southeast Hotel on West Zilaihuo Street, French Concession.

The single check is enclosed, and we would be grateful if you could accept it.

### Silver Syndicate Provides Five Million in Cash to Banks and Financial Institutions; Banks and Financial Institutions to Draw Funds Today on a Quota Basis, Premium Has Dropped Sharply, Expected to be Eliminated Soon

The fourth quarter for industrial and commercial enterprises is approaching. The Money Trade Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, chaired by Lu Yichen, who reported the purpose of the meeting, after which discussions began immediately.

1.  The fourth quarter inter-bank market rate was resolved to be six yuan.
2.  The interest on deposits and loans for March was resolved to be three yuan for deposits and eighteen yuan for loans. The resolutions were immediately copied and notified to the member financial institutions for compliance. Regarding long-term credit loans that are due for the fourth quarter, extensions will be granted to established customers with good credit, but the interest must be paid in full. A new loan agreement will be signed, stipulating that there must be reliable shop guarantees and personal guarantees, and new long-term credit loans will be handled appropriately.

Providing Cash to Stabilize the Market

In order to regulate the finances of the same industry and stabilize the market, the Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve Bank is providing cash to member banks and financial institutions after adjusting the allocation amounts. The amount of cash provided to each bank is determined by the Bank Reserve Council based on the circumstances of each bank. The amount of cash provided to each financial institution is stipulated by the Money Trade Reserve Bank to be 100,000 yuan per institution, totaling 52 institutions, for a total of 5.2 million yuan. All are scheduled to be drawn by the banks and financial institutions with a quota payment to the Reserve Bank today (25th), or credited to the cash accounts of the banks and financial institutions. Since the implementation, the premium on draws has dropped sharply and is expected to be completely eliminated soon.

Early Banking and Financial Institution Business Hours - The Joint Committee of Silver and Money Industry Members announced yesterday, "From May 1st of this year, the business hours of all banks and financial institutions will be changed to 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and Saturdays from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM." The reason is that Japanese banks have been operating one hour earlier since March 1st, so the clearing and check return times on the Bund have been brought forward accordingly. This one-hour difference has caused the committee to find the bill collection procedures for the same industry inconvenient and to feel that the time is tight. Therefore, with reference to the previous summer daylight saving time method, the business hours have been adjusted to one hour earlier.

### Regarding the Implementation of the Baojia System, Two Points of Clarification from the Authorities; Opinions May Be Submitted in Writing, and Donations Will, of Course, Be Accepted

The Public Relations Office of the Municipal Council announced that the implementation of the Baojia system (i.e., the organization of self-defense groups) in the International Settlement, as advocated by the Municipal Council, is to avoid misunderstandings that may arise in outside circles. Therefore, it should be stated that the Council has a standing committee dedicated to handling Baojia matters. Taxpayers within the settlement who have insightful suggestions regarding the Baojia system may submit them in writing to the committee for study and improvement. The expenses required for the implementation of the Baojia system have already been included in the budget for 1942. If the public, purely out of their own volition, generously donate funds for the purpose of operating the Baojia, the Council will, of course, be most welcoming.

The State of Security in the Settlement After the Implementation of the Baojia System

According to a report from the Police Department of the Municipal Council, the implementation of the Baojia system began in the International Settlement at the end of February, and self-defense groups were organized. Last month, under the supervision and guidance of police officers, progress continued rapidly.

The bomb explosions resulted in nine deaths and twenty-five injuries, including four Japanese nationals and two Koreans. There was one assassination case, in which three Japanese employees of the Naigai Wata Kaisha were attacked, two fatally, and the other severely injured.

### Sunday, Rice Godowns Open as Usual

According to inquiries from the Datong News Agency reporters, the rice that the Municipal Council's Rice Office designated to be collected from the five warehouses, including the Taikoo Warehouse, Roosevelt Warehouse, Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse, Zhongfang Warehouse, and Huishan Warehouse, rice dealers in the two settlements have begun to collect from yesterday, but have not yet finished the delivery, or may be extended to tomorrow to complete the delivery. Although tomorrow is Sunday, the Municipal Council has implemented regulations so that warehouses can still be opened as usual on this day to release rice. Yesterday, all the rice dealers in the two settlements sold the crushed corn they had been allotted, and the supply situation was quite smooth, but the crowds of purchasers were also very congested, and were still numbered and lined up by the constables. As for the rice dealers whose licenses have been revoked by the Municipal Council due to violations of regulations, the corn or rice that they should have been allotted has been reallocated by the Municipal Council to rice dealers on the same street or nearby, so that the rice-buying public residing in the city within the district will not be affected.

### The Municipal Council Encourages Group Evacuations; Assists Fellow Provincials Returning to Hubei; A Ship Scheduled to Sail to Hankou at the End of This Month; The Chinese Evacuation Committee is Currently in Negotiations

According to a statement from the Public Relations Office of the Municipal Council, the Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee is very interested in assisting the authorities in handling evacuation matters. It is also meticulously consulting with various parties to provide convenience to those returning to their hometowns. Some time ago, it assisted the Fujian Fellow-Provincial Association in arranging for 200 fellow provincials from Xiamen to return home on the Jinmen Maru at half price. The result was very smooth. The Jinmen Maru of the East Asia Shipping Company set sail for Xiamen on the 9th of this month. Now there is another ship scheduled to sail to Hankou on the 28th or 29th of this month. The committee is also in negotiations with the Japanese Consulate General and the East Asia Shipping Company to assist the Hubei Fellow-Provincial Association in evacuating approximately 200 fellow provincials to Hankou. This type of group evacuation method not only saves travel expenses for those returning home, but also makes it easier to take care of each other along the way. However, there are two conditions: 1. There must be at least 200 people returning to the same hometown at the same time. 2. They must go to the same destination. It is hoped that other fellow-provincial associations in Shanghai will follow suit and handle the evacuation of their fellow provincials. The committee will be happy to negotiate with all parties on their behalf and provide convenience.

Fellow Provincials from Taizhou Encouraged to Return Home The Taizhou Fellow-Provincial Association in Shanghai issued a notice yesterday to fellow provincials from Taizhou, stating that if there is no essential reason to stay in Shanghai, they should quickly return home. The notice stated: "Prices in Shanghai are soaring, and it is difficult to make a living. Our association is assisting the Municipal Council in handling evacuation matters. All fellow provincials who do not necessarily need to stay in Shanghai are requested to come to the association to register as soon as possible to arrange for their return home, so as to avoid the threat to their livelihoods. However, the journey home is too far, and the land and water routes are not easy. Our association is eager to provide guidance on their behalf, so please do not hesitate any longer."

Yang Qingyi, a native of Fujian, is 28 years old and lives at No. 636 Edward Road. He is a fireman on the Dahua steamship of the Xinhua Steamship Company. He usually leaves Shanghai with the ship. Last December, Yang left Shanghai again. His wife, Mrs. Someone, feeling lonely, discussed the matter with her sister Zhu Shoubao (who lives at No. 17 Yuqing Lane, Yuqing Street, Nanshi), asking her to have her 15-year-old daughter Zhu Meisheng come to her home to keep her company. Zhu agreed. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on December 6, while Yang's wife was out shopping, Yang suddenly returned home and saw Zhu Meisheng in the room. He was suddenly aroused with bestial desires and forcibly raped the girl, forbidding her from making any noise. The girl was young and ignorant and agreed. Unexpectedly, on the 16th, the girl's lower body suddenly became inflamed. She was sent to the hospital for treatment, and it took more than a month to recover. However, Zhu Shoubao still did not know about her daughter's rape. Recently, the girl's lower body became inflamed again. After a doctor diagnosed that it was caused by toxins infected by a man, Zhu Shoubao sternly questioned her daughter Zhu Meisheng, who finally revealed the truth. Zhu immediately reported the matter to the Laozha Police Station. Chinese detective Li Pengfei arrested Yang yesterday and placed him in custody, pending investigation and further action.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: According to the parties involved, Zhang Yuqing, Zhang Qixin, and Huang Lijun, shareholders of the Greater China Refinery, they claimed that they read the news on the 21st, "Manager Sells Soap, Shareholders Believe it is Embezzled," which was not entirely consistent with the facts and concerned the reputation of the shareholders. They entrusted a letter to correct the following: The alkali soap embezzled by Luo Zilin was purchased in partnership for the purpose of refining silk for customers, and it was not a commodity sold by the factory. Although Luo was the manager, he had no right to sell it privately. Yuqing et al. and Luo Zilin were all shareholders executing business and were paid salaries and meal expenses. Luo was not treated unfairly. According to the law, unless otherwise stipulated in the partnership agreement, they may not request remuneration. After the colleagues discovered Luo's embezzlement, they negotiated in vain and had no choice but to report it to the police station, who detained Luo and sent him to the court. The defendant confessed without denying it. The court ordered that he be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to a later date. After part of the embezzled goods, namely caustic soda, were recovered, the court allowed him to be released on bail. The Shinhua Refined Green Soap, which had been sold and could not be recovered, had a market value of 50,000 yuan in national currency. The factory has now filed an incidental civil suit, etc. In view of this, a corresponding letter is hereby sent, hoping that it will be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column of your newspaper to conform to the facts and avoid misunderstandings. Respectfully submitted to the Editor of the Shen Bao, Lawyer Zhang Zongzai, April 24.

Yesterday's newspaper was released at 6:25 PM.

### Four-Wheeled Combined Vehicle

This strange four-wheeled combined vehicle has a bicycle in front and a non-carriage rickshaw in the back. It is most suitable for a man and a woman to ride together. The man sits in the front and pedals, which is, of course, his duty. If a person is traveling alone, the rear car can be removed, and only the bicycle in front can be ridden to eliminate obstacles, making the ride more convenient. This type of vehicle was discovered as early as ten years ago, but it was not popular at the time and was gradually eliminated. Until recently, civilian cars have almost disappeared, and bicycles have suddenly risen in the context of traffic difficulties. Various types of alternative transportation tools have emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The four-wheeled vehicle in the picture is one of them.

### An Era's Darling: The Rise of the Bicycle (Part 1) - All Sorts Sweeping the Times

In modern warfare, a drop of oil equals a drop of blood. Regardless of the war machine, without oil for combustion and lubrication, it immediately loses its effectiveness. The importance of oil in war is self-evident. Therefore, all belligerent nations, even if their oil reserves are ample and supplies are uninterrupted, strive to conserve oil consumption. However, oil for war institutions cannot be lacking, lest it affect combat capability. As a last resort, they have to restrict civilian oil consumption, striving to reduce expenditure. Of civilian oil use, nine out of ten parts are consumed by automobiles. Once restricted, automobiles are like "city tigers" drained of blood, no longer able to dominate the thoroughfares. What rises to replace them, of course, is the bicycle, which has been coldly treated by the world for decades, but now is joyfully taken up again and widely welcomed.

Since the outbreak of the World War, European countries have devoted all gasoline to military use. Civilian transportation has encountered major difficulties, and people have switched to using bicycles as a substitute. It is said that the city with the most bicycles is Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. Its residents, both young and old, have bicycles, riding head-to-tail on the streets, all day long. The situation is similar in other countries. Why would Shanghai be any different?

The Ancestor of the Bicycle

The history of the bicycle is over a hundred years old. It once swept the times. Later, as transportation tools evolved and automobiles were invented, they usurped the bicycle's position and dominated land transportation. However, the bicycle is still the most convenient means of transportation, and it has finally risen again when the automobile's prestige has waned slightly to meet people's needs. The earliest history of the bicycle is difficult to investigate. In 1816, the Frenchman Nic√©phore Ni√©pce invented the "Wooden Horse" in France, which was probably the world's first bicycle. Ni√©pce's "Wooden Horse" was very similar to modern bicycles, but it was made entirely of wood, with a crude design, front and rear wheels of the same size, wheel rims wrapped in iron, and a T-shaped wooden stick on the front wheel to control direction. However, it lacked a hinge to rotate the rear wheel. The person riding the "horse" had to alternately step on the ground with both feet to propel it, like running, and then lift both feet to glide forward. To modern people, this "Wooden Horse" may seem incredibly clumsy, but it is, after all, the origin of the bicycle.

Early Discovery in Sichuan

As for the exact date when the bicycle was first introduced to China, it has been lost to history. We can only, to the best of our ability, trace the past and know that in 1888, bicycles were discovered in Sichuan Province. The people did not know its name and called it "Iron Horse". This bicycle was a great improvement compared to Nic√©phore Ni√©pce's "Wooden Horse". The body was made of iron, and the center of gravity was entirely on the front wheel. The rear wheel was an auxiliary wheel, which maintained the balance of the entire vehicle, so the front wheel was about ten times larger than the rear wheel. On both sides of the front wheel's axle, three-fold cranks were installed, which were stepped on up and down with both feet to make the front wheel rotate and move forward. This is the same as the forward principle of modern bicycles, except it lacked a hinge.

Foreigners Show Off in the Streets

Around 1894, an American couple traveled the world on bicycles, passing through China from east to west. Four years later, some foreigners in Shanghai, who were ahead of the times, started riding bicycles, showing off in the streets. At that time, passersby, who had rarely seen such things, regarded it as a strange sight. Soon, the wheels were fitted with pneumatic tires, which already had the form of modern bicycles, and were more comfortable and convenient to ride. As a result, some novelty-seeking Chinese citizens and students also imitated them and began riding bicycles.

Two Competitions Held

In America and Europe, there are professional bicycle races, which are also a major sports business. In the early part of this century and around 1930, foreigners in Shanghai twice built bicycle racing venues, hoping to excite the entire city and make a fortune. Unexpectedly, both failed. Bicycle sports have never been lucky in Shanghai. At most, bicycle races with a competitive nature were held before the war.

Vermilion, Milky White, Light Yellow

In the last thirty years, bicycles have been greatly improved, and to this day, whether in terms of performance or style, it can be said that they have reached a state of perfection. Especially the lightweight and nimble racing bikes and women's bikes are painted with vermilion, milky white, light yellow, or emerald green colors. The shiny steel spoke wheels speed along the asphalt road, quietly brushing past like a gust of wind. How can this not make passersby who are suffering and trudging on their feet envious? If it is a young couple dressed like butterflies, riding side by side, it makes people feel envious. One thing that is regrettable is that the city prohibits two people from riding the same ordinary bicycle. Otherwise, those girls who love to show off may as well ride on the back seat, snuggling behind their boyfriends, riding around like they're on a motorbike. However, Shanghai also has tandem bicycles, which can ultimately make up for this small regret. It is best to have a "woman in the same car" when riding a tandem bicycle, which can make passersby look sideways.

New Cars Emerge One After Another

Shanghai's bicycles have always been only the ordinary two-wheeled type; if not, there are only three-wheeled delivery vehicles. However, in recent months, with the oil supply cut off, ordinary automobiles have had to be left in garages or alleys. As a result, bicycles have suddenly become popular, and various newly designed three-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles have been discovered one after another, mostly based on bicycle modifications. These are meant to carry one or two more people. The most common is to add a boat-shaped wicker basket and a wheel to the side of the bicycle. The newer ones have different structures and styles, but they generally have a compartment in the front of the bicycle that can seat one person, and one or two people can sit behind the compartment, pedaling forward. The one with a single rear seat is suitable for carrying passengers, which can be used by many unemployed chauffeurs to earn a living. The one with two rear seats is most suitable for small families to use, allowing children to sit safely in the compartment, while their parents pedal behind. There is also a four-wheeled vehicle that can seat two people, with a style that looks like a car. It also uses a steering wheel to control the front wheels, but instead of an engine, it uses pedals. Because these vehicles are heavier, their speed is much lower than ordinary bicycles, and adopters are not widespread.

### Bond Market Tense ‚Äì Competition Intensifies ‚Äì Success Still Uncertain ‚Äì Thirty-Two Winners Delighted in the "Yi" Lottery Draw

The over-the-counter bond market saw continuous selling pressure yesterday, with sellers consistently flooding the market. Buyers, although numerous and financially strong, engaged in fierce competition. The outcome remained uncertain, leaving smaller speculators fatigued. Short sellers were intimidated by the strength of the buyers, while long buyers feared the influx of spot goods from the sellers. Wavering and indecisive, they entered and exited the market frequently, resulting in extremely busy trading. Type C bonds, for example, rose to 64 yuan before falling to 62 yuan, only to recover slightly to over 63 yuan by closing. Competition between buyers and sellers with genuine assets was already intense, and the speculative element further stirred up the market, making it even more tense and lively. This situation is unlikely to be sustainable. Yesterday, Tongli was the largest seller, offering over one million units, followed by Tongsheng and Xing. On the buying side, Qianyi led, followed by Tongshun, Chengkang, Baolong, and Renchang. Other firms like Jiufu, Jiufeng, Yichang, Shuntai, Ruida, Hongxing, Xie Kang, Hu He Ji, and Shunli were aligned with the buyers, while Xinhua, Lida, Yuxing, Dazhong, Xinji, Tongji, and Lianyi were on the selling side. These figures do not include smaller transactions, leaving speculators in a state of uncertainty. Future movements are hard to predict. As a result, price fluctuations were limited, with Types A and D rising slightly and Types B and E falling. Type C remained unchanged, while Type E suffered significant losses. Total trading volume exceeded two million yuan.

The lottery draw for the 13th installment of principal repayment for the 1936 Unified National Bonds (Type B) was held in Chongqing on March 10. The winning numbers, consisting of the last three digits, were 002, 037, 052, 101, 118, 134, 220, 229, 270, 292, 355, 387, 393, 401, 440, 447, 502, 534, 547, 602, 687, 695, 753, 769, 774, 790, 824, 880, 899, 908, 909, and 913, totaling thirty-two numbers. Each winning number represents a principal repayment of 150,000 yuan, totaling 4.8 million yuan. Principal and the 13th installment of interest will be paid by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications on July 31 of this year.

### Tianjin Speculators Exit ‚Äì Gold Market Quickly Retreats

The gold market, which had seen a price increase, suddenly experienced a reversal yesterday, falling below the 22,000 yuan level. While wealthy individuals continued to absorb gold, their numbers were limited. Cash shops and silversmiths began to release their holdings, and Tianjin speculators continued to sell. Market sentiment shifted from firm to uncertain. The morning saw the initial price for each tael (ten liang) at 22,300 yuan, an increase of 150 yuan. Subsequent transactions occurred at 22,200 yuan. Securities firms absorbed the selling pressure, causing sellers to become hesitant. The price then rose by 350 yuan to 22,550 yuan. However, certain gold shops, silversmiths, and securities firms began to sell, with Tianjin speculators being particularly active. This caused a sharp price decline of 1,150 yuan, reaching a low of 21,400 yuan. At noon, the price stood at 21,500 yuan, a decrease of 650 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading volume increased significantly, with a price range of 1,150 yuan throughout the day.

Silversmiths quoted a price of 2,250 yuan per liang of gold for jewelry, a decrease of 50 yuan, with purchase prices ranging from 1,950 yuan to 2,200 yuan. Silver ingots were priced at 18 yuan, with the black market price rising to approximately 17.5 yuan. Silver coins were being sold at over 10 yuan, with some offering 10.23 yuan, but sellers were scarce.

Yesterday, the interbank lending rate set by the Money Trade Association remained at 1.3%, while the discount rate for "ÂäÉÈ†≠" (overdraft) notes remained at approximately 5 yuan per thousand. The difference between "ÂäÉÈ†≠" and cash notes remained at 0.28 to 0.3 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Show Little Fluctuation

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw slight decreases in the prices of British and American gold coins, with the former at 470 yuan and the latter at 480 yuan. American dollar bills were priced at 35 yuan, similar to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars rose to 5.1 yuan, with large bills trading at a slightly lower price. Military notes opened at 7.16 yuan in the morning before falling to 7.13 yuan. Near noon, they rose to 7.17 yuan before suddenly falling to 7.08 yuan in the afternoon. The final price was 7.12 yuan, a decrease of 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Bank Operating Hours Advance to 9 AM ‚Äì Exchange System Restored

The Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Association decided yesterday that, due to the foreign banks' operating hours changing to 9 AM starting March 1, the operating hours of all banks and money houses will be advanced by one hour starting May 1. The new hours will be 9 AM to 3 PM from Monday to Friday and 9 AM to 12 PM on Saturday.

The Shanghai Banking Association Preparatory Committee (i.e., the Clearing House) intends to restore the former timed exchange system (i.e., designated times for representatives from each member bank to exchange notes at the Clearing House) due to the increased volume of notes being processed. The interior renovations of the Clearing House are now complete, and the restored exchange system will be implemented starting May 1.

### Rapidly Changing "Double Horse" Factory Orders ‚Äì Yarn Market Remains Stable

The spot market for cotton yarn remains stable. However, "Double Horse" factory orders are fluctuating wildly, causing instability. 42-count Blue Phoenix is priced between 14,000 and 12,900 yuan, 42-count Bao Guang at 12,950 yuan, 40-count Jincheng at 11,650 yuan, 60-count Riguang at 22,900 yuan, 60-count Xishi Riguang at 11,900 yuan, 32-count Xiantao between 9,900 and 10,000 yuan, 32-count Xiantao Double Ply at 12,300 yuan, 20-count Lima at 6,900 yuan, 20-count Yueqin at 6,300 yuan, 20-count Xiantao at 6,300 yuan, 20-count Shuang Diqiu at 6,250 yuan, 20-count Shuang Ma between 6,200 and 6,100 yuan, 20-count Da Xi at 6,200 yuan, 20-count Xiantao at 6,300 yuan, 10-count Te Jincheng at 4,600 yuan, 10-count Hong Shuangma between 4,700 and 4,830 yuan, 10-count Tong Zijun at 4,780 yuan, 10-count Hong Bao Yi at 4,750 yuan, 10-count Da Fa at 4,850 yuan, 10-count Songhe at 4,300 yuan, 18-count Zhinv at 6,400 yuan. The initial price of "Double Horse" factory orders surged wildly, fueled by rumors of 100 bales leaving the factory. This created a heated atmosphere, with the initial price at 5,000 yuan, immediately jumping to 5,120 yuan, then rising to 5,200 yuan. Buyers continued to come, gradually pushing the price up to 5,420 yuan. Mid-session profit-taking eased the price back to 5,190 yuan, but strong buying continued, pushing the price back up to 5,350 yuan at closing. Off-market transactions reached 5,410 yuan. Forward premiums were at 24 yuan.

### Piece Goods Surge Along with Yarn Prices

Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market rose along with yarn prices, boosting market sentiment. Spot goods were extremely scarce, with demand exceeding supply. 16-pound Shuangxiang Coarse Cloth was quoted at 280 yuan, but no transactions were recorded. Diqiu at 265 yuan, Feihong at 250 yuan, 14-pound Yilu at 240 yuan, 12-pound Fugui Fine Cloth at 222 yuan, Factory Order at 190 yuan, Dapeng Fine Cloth at 235 yuan, Chuji Shiblin opened at 355 yuan in the morning and rose to 358 yuan in the afternoon.

In the afternoon, prices started at 70 yuan and rose to 72 yuan. The closing price was 270.5 yuan. Sijunzi Serge red orders peaked at 9.15 yuan, dropped to a low of 8.78 yuan, and then saw a tense rebound at closing, rising to 8.98 yuan.

### Reduced Sales in the Coarse Grains Market

The coarse grains market showed a flat and weak trend yesterday due to decent deliveries from the suburbs. Demand in this area has declined, and major traders are taking a wait-and-see approach, resulting in a lack of market enthusiasm. Except for sesame and red grains, which remained stable, the rest saw a downward trend, with slight decreases of several cents to one yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions included 50 bags of Nanqiao Yellow Beans at 238 yuan, 30 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow at 235 yuan, over 100 bags of Sand Red at prices ranging from 231 yuan (self-delivery) to 234 yuan, 20 bags of Jiangbei Peas at 208 yuan, 50 bags of Tianjin Green Beans at 245 yuan, 286 bags of Mingguang Red Grains at 150 yuan, 50 bags of Nanjing White Sesame at 343 yuan, March stack orders for Lizhi Soybean Cake at 54.3 yuan per 2,000 pieces, 900 pieces of Hankou Soybean Cake at 40 yuan, April new stack orders for Shengji Soybean Cake at 56.5 yuan per 1,000 pieces, May old stack orders at 48.25 yuan, and April stack orders for Feizhi Cake at 54 yuan per vehicle.

Bran transactions were sporadic and lacked bulk sales. However, most sellers were unwilling to offer discounts, so the market remained firm. Transactions included 150 bags of San Yu Large Bag Bran at prices ranging from 109 yuan to 109.5 yuan.

### The Great German Opera Composer, Mozart's Musical Gathering

By Hong

The Zheng Yue Society plans to hold a concert next month, conducted by Professor Zhao Meibo.

On January 27, 1756, a child prodigy was born in Salzburg, Austria, who would become the great German opera composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart began learning piano at the age of two, and by four, he was attempting to compose even though he could not read music. His sister, Nannerl, who was five years older, was also exceptionally talented and later became a renowned pianist. The siblings shared a deep and affectionate bond, and Nannerl played a significant role in Mozart's success.

Mozart's ancestors were also musicians, so upon discovering the extraordinary talents of their children, they abandoned their existing professions to focus on nurturing them. When Mozart was six, his father took him and Nannerl on a tour of Munich and Vienna. The following year, they visited Paris. The child prodigy Mozart's organ playing was highly praised. Haydn especially loved him like a disciple, and the young and old geniuses formed a friendship that transcended age. In the following decade, the child prodigy created numerous masterpieces, gaining fame throughout Europe.

While Mozart was residing in Mannheim, he fell in love with the singer Aloysia Weber and desired to marry her. However, due to her coldness and his family's opposition, his wishes were not fulfilled. At that time, Mozart was only eighteen years old. Six years later, he married Aloysia's sister, Constanze. Constanze was also a famous singer but was frail and often ill, resembling Lin Daiyu. Mozart's life after marriage was not always smooth sailing, unlike his renowned childhood, where everything seemed to go his way. However, Mozart and Constanze had a loving relationship, and until his death, their love remained as fresh as on their wedding day. They were a naturally loving couple, unaffected by setbacks and disappointments.

During this period, Mozart continued to compose diligently, producing operas like a spring. Although he eventually regained fame, the child prodigy could not withstand the storms of life. On December 5, 1791, he passed away at the young age of thirty-five. On the day of his funeral, his wife was too ill to get out of bed, and the weather was stormy. Friends and relatives turned back halfway. He was buried in a desolate graveyard, and days later, Constanze could not locate her beloved husband's tomb. How tragic can human affairs be?

Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra held two Mozart memorial concerts, which were unprecedentedly successful. The Zheng Yue Society (Concert Spiritue), led by the renowned musician Professor Zhao Meibo, will also hold a grand Mozart memorial concert next month at the Cathay Theatre. Last year marked the 150th anniversary of Mozart's death, and music lovers from China and abroad want to commemorate this great man.

The Zheng Yue Society is a powerful musical group composed of students from various universities and Professor Zhao's outstanding students. The first half of the concert will feature string quartets, solos, and vocal performances, all performed by renowned artists in the city. The second half will feature the Zheng Yue Society's 80-member choir performing Mozart's famous "Twelfth Mass," conducted by Professor Zhao Meibo. Professor Zhao has previously conducted Gaul's "The Holy City," Beethoven's "Mass in C Major," Cherubini's "Fourth Mass," and Ginbert's "Mass," achieving remarkable success and receiving high praise from experts both in China and abroad. Mozart's works are profound and magnificent, and this concert will undoubtedly be a significant artistic offering. All music lovers should not miss it.

### Musings on "Three Autumns" - The Golden Cangue

By Luo Zuyao

"The Golden Cangue," also known as "June Snow," is adapted from Guan Hanqing's "Dou E Injustice" from the Yuan Dynasty. All actors who play the Qingyi role must be familiar with this play. The "Three Autumns" I am referring to are Yanqiu (Á®ãÁ°ØÁßã), Guiqiu (Ê¢ÖËò≠Ëä≥), and Gu Zhengqiu (È°ßÊ≠£Áßã) from the Drama School.

Yanqiu loved tragic tunes and was known for his refined and elegant style. He often surpassed others with his interpretation. His performance of this play was a masterpiece that no one dared to emulate. His singing was mournful and indignant, like a young woman's weeping. The sadness in his voice seemed to suggest untold grief. This mastery of the Cheng-style singing was not achieved overnight. The Beikai Company specially recorded the two major scenes of his imprisonment and execution, which were filled with sorrow and regret, moving listeners to tears. It was a masterpiece.

Guiqiu's "The Golden Cangue" was restrained without being explicit, refined without being crude. His melodies were charming and his intentions gentle, yet flashes of beauty were sometimes seen. He was a worthy rival of Yanqiu. Although his acting was slightly inferior, it was not a significant flaw for Guiqiu. It is strange that he has not enjoyed widespread fame until now.

Gu Zhengqiu cannot be compared to Yanqiu or Guiqiu, but she is young and her future is immeasurable. Her sorrow and beauty resemble Yanqiu, her tenderness resembles Huisheng (ËçÄÊÖßÁîü), and her grand demeanor resembles Wan Hua (Â∞öÂ∞è‰∫ë). The beauty of these three is combined in one person. In ten years, even if Er Yun (‰ΩôÂèîÂ≤©) were to see her, he would be impressed.

### Introducing the Famous Qin Player Ni Qiuping
‚Äî Shao Xi

Mr. Ni Qiuping, upon the invitation of his teacher Wang Shaoqing, assists Li Shifang, the new star of Peking opera, on the erhu. Ladies and gentlemen in Shanghai who appreciate opera, and qin enthusiasts, though they have already witnessed his skills and recognized his talent, may not know the general process of his learning the qin. Here is an introduction.

Mr. Ni's ancestral home is Wuxian, but he resides in Shanghai. His father is a giant in the shipping industry. Mr. Ni engages in commerce but has a passion for the erhu. In his early years, he studied under Chen Dao'an, and later received guidance from Chen Yanchong. Because he possesses extraordinary talent, he can play any piece of music as soon as he gets the score. His sound is particularly vigorous and bright. Before long, he became famous in the amateur circle. Sun Zuochen heard his elegant performance and praised him highly, giving him much instruction. Famous northern players such as Xu Lanyuan, Zhao Jiwan, and Gao Liankui also often exchanged ideas with him, and he gained more and more. When he heard Wang Shaoqing's performance, he was deeply impressed, believing that what he had learned in the past was not enough to surpass the ordinary. So, he devoted himself to learning from Wang. Whenever he encountered difficult passages, he would study and research them, often staying up all night until he mastered them. In the Jiaxu year (1934), he traveled north to Beijing. A certain gentleman invited him to assist in the opera "Trial of the Head and Assassination of Tang." While tuning the instrument backstage, the sound was loud and thunderous. More than a dozen qin players at the time rushed to watch, and because they did not recognize him, they were surprised and amazed, exclaiming that it was "Old Yuan Reborn." When he played the Erhuang Manban on stage, the audience cheered thunderously. His popularity was even greater than that of the main performer that night. After returning to the south, he tuned the voice for Mei Lanfang for three to five operas every day, and Mei was not tired of it. He once said to others, "Shaoqing cannot stay in Shanghai for long, but now that we have Mr. Ni, I have no regrets." This shows how highly he regarded him. In the spring of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), when Mei Lanfang performed "Huang Yijin," Shaoqing came to Shanghai again at his invitation. Mr. Ni, introduced by Huanhua Zhongyi and others, knelt at Wang's door, and Shaoqing accepted him as a disciple, which was the first time he had done so. Therefore, he taught him all his life's experience. Mr. Ni also received instructions with respect and diligence. Within a few months, he had mastered all the secrets. In the spring of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he recorded two pieces for the Baidai Company, Guo Xiaocheng's "Girl's Departure." The beauty of the erhu's tone was almost indistinguishable from Shaoqing's. Last year, he wrote a series of articles on string music in the Ten-Day Drama Magazine, which were published serially. He spoke from his own experience, with many insightful points, and presented them in a humorous and engaging way, sweeping away the dryness and dullness of other writings on the qin. Mr. Ni has become a master of the erhu, proficient in both male and female roles, but he is still modest, saying that he is broad but not refined. In recent years, he has been suffering from heart enlargement, and friends often advise him to give up the erhu and rest quietly, but after a few months, he is back to playing as diligently as before. This time, helping Li Shifang is purely at the invitation of his teacher. When the time comes, on the red carpet, he and his teacher will show their skills together, which will surely satisfy our ears. Therefore, this is an introduction, with a recent photo of the teacher and student attached (Wang Shaoqing on the right, Ni Qiuping on the left).

### One Location of the Puyushe Society
‚Äî Ge Ge

The Puyushe Society, which was once a sensation, has become a thing of the past. Currently, its only location is the Nanjing Bookstore. Apart from Sanxue and Wang Meiyun, the He siblings are the most prominent. After Qinfang was hired to measure pearls for someone last year, Yunfang teamed up with her younger sister Jianfang, first traveling inland, where they were well received. This time, the army came to Shanghai, and Jianfang has grown into a graceful young woman with the beauty of a maiden. Her Yu tune is very similar to her sister's, and her storytelling is also quite good. Her future achievements are limitless. In addition to Nanjing, she has recently been hired by the Dongfang No. 2 Bookstore to sing and play double bead balls. From now on, Puyushe Society will have another location.

### Short Biographies of Pear Garden Figures
‚Äî Written by Zheng Guoyi, Drawn by Zhang Yizhang, Part of Female Performers
(Sixteen) Du Liyun

In the past ten years or so, many new female performers have emerged in the Peking opera scene of the old capital, taking turns leading the troupe. Among them, She Yingyun, a rare flower from the south who went to Beijing to enjoy temporary fame, was the first to set the trend, and therefore her seniority is quite high. Du Liyun emerged slightly after Zhang Eyun, and her position is also strictly comparable to Zhang Eyun's. Both of them can be considered to have brought honor to female performers from the south. It is said that Du Liyun suffered a lot when she first arrived in Beijing. Her later achievements were half due to her perseverance and struggle. Liyun is not exceptionally beautiful, but she has a tall and slender figure, and her appearance is more graceful than Zhang Eyun's, with great poise. Her pronunciation is not free of local accent, which is one of her shortcomings, but her voice is broad and not as sharp and piercing as that of other female performers. Her natural talent helps her a lot, and this short coming is also covered up a bit. In short, Du Liyun is a natural good talent for singing female roles, but she had not yet fully developed her artistry when she married and retired from the stage, no longer appearing on the red carpet.

(3) A Guest Arrives

The magpie came to ask if the young master had seen Miss Cuizhen. Weicheng said, "No." The magpie said, "I don't know where she went. The second mistress is looking for her." Before she finished speaking, someone suddenly answered from the dark room behind the Shuangmei Study: "I'm here." The one speaking was Cuizhen. Compared to Guofang, one is simple and the other is gorgeous, one is reserved and the other is lively. When Cuizhen came out, Weicheng stopped her and said, "I'll introduce you to someone, this is Miss Chen, her brother is my classmate, this classmate is different from Huang Long." Cuizhen smiled unnaturally, her face already flushed, and stood still, saying, "Miss Chen, please sit down." Weicheng said, "Sister Cuizhen, don't leave, you talk to Miss Chen too. Xique, go and tell the second mistress that Miss Cuizhen is here." Xique went out. Guofang saw that Cuizhen was holding velvet rope and bamboo needles in her hands, and knew that she must be a relative of Weicheng. She knew her name, but not her surname, so she asked Cuizhen's surname with a smile. Weicheng said, "Guofang, don't be so formal with my sister Cuizhen, she is very honest and not used to being polite with guests." Cuizhen saw Guofang leaning against the table and talking to Weicheng, so she invited Guofang to sit down. Guofang sat down, but she didn't sit down herself. She said to Weicheng, "I'll go see if that room inside can be used for Miss Chen to stay in. You two talk and come in, I'll hide inside. Because Miss Chen looks like a fairy, I really don't dare to stand next to her. I already saw her when Miss Chen entered the gate."

Guofang thought Weicheng's saying that Cuizhen wouldn't be polite with people was a bit biased, so she quickly stood up and protested with a smile. Weicheng explained again and introduced them in more detail, until he sat down to eat with them.

### Group Tunes
‚Äî Zefu

Group tunes are a random collection of several types of tunes, so their format is quite similar to Pai Zi tunes, except that there is no tune title, number of singers, etc. at the beginning. Originally, they were called "Taiping Lyrics" because many of the group tunes in the lyrics were victory songs personally written by Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty, hence the name Taiping (Peace). Later, they were used exclusively as opening tunes for festive gatherings, losing their original meaning, so they were renamed Group Tunes. Today, the most prevalent group tunes are those with auspicious words, such as "Eight Immortals Celebrating Longevity," "Immortal Breeze Drifting," and "Longevity Incense," which are all used during birthday celebrations. Occasionally, they also depict scenes, such as "Great Autumn Scenery" and "Small Autumn Scenery." However, when singing, the entire troupe must be neatly dressed, with a solemn atmosphere, each holding gongs, drums, and musical instruments, standing around the table, and not sitting, which still preserves the intention of respecting the imperial creation of the Taiping lyrics. The singing method is that one person first sings a section following the stringed instruments, then the gongs and drums sound together, and the entire troupe sings together in unison. After singing a sentence, the gongs and drums are struck once. After singing several tunes in this way, a concluding section is sung, which is considered the end. Therefore, when singing group tunes, the tone is entirely based on solemnity and liveliness, which is different from the elegance and refinement that Pai Zi tunes excel in.
