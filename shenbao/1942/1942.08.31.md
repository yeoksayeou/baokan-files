### Central Sector, Kaluga Region: Soviet Large-Scale Counteroffensive, Fierce Battle, Winds and Clouds Change Color; Germany Claims to Have Penetrated Stalingrad's Defensive Line

Lisbon, 30th, Alliance News Agency: According to reports here, the battle for Stalingrad has intensified due to continuous reinforcements from both German and Soviet elite troops. Manchukuo's elite troops arrived on the battlefield on the 29th, and Germany's elite armored divisions and infantry divisions are also successively arriving at the front lines, launching fierce attacks on the Soviet positions along the Volga River and the roads leading to Stalingrad. Soviet Southern Front Commander Marshal Timoshenko is also continuously dispatching large armies to the front lines for reinforcement. The citizens of Stalingrad are organizing volunteer armies to participate in the defense. Soviet troops have dug trenches within 22 kilometers around Stalingrad and built fortresses and tank traps, actively strengthening defensive facilities. German Luftwaffe dive bomber squadrons are constantly bombing these fortresses and military facilities in Stalingrad. To contain the German operations, the Soviet forces are exerting every effort to counterattack west of Moscow, aiming to recapture the city of Rzhev, which has been occupied by the German forces. Therefore, fierce fighting is currently underway in the northern and northeastern suburbs of the city. In that area, in addition to deploying Polish troops, the German forces have converted houses into fortresses and buried mines and anti-tank obstacles in the roads to repel the Soviet counteroffensive.

Bear City, 30th, Alliance News Agency: In the Kaluga region, 110 miles southwest of Moscow, according to a German radio report yesterday, the Red Army, regardless of sacrifice, attacked with infantry, tanks, and air force. The German troops fought desperately, and the winds and clouds changed color. As a result, the German positions remained unshaken. Berlin, 30th, Huitong News Agency: According to German war reports, German forces have broken through the Soviet positions on the front lines of Stalingrad. After fierce fighting... Bear City, 30th, Alliance News Agency: German tank units penetrated the defensive lines of Stalingrad. Soviet infantry and tanks are doing their utmost to block them. Fierce fighting is taking place in all major combat areas on the eastern front, but no major changes have occurred. The eastern front situation is described in detail as follows: In the Stalingrad area, German forces continue to advance towards the city, but the Red Army's resistance is becoming increasingly strong and launching large-scale counterattacks. The Red Army General Headquarters seems to have transferred a large number of air force and anti-aircraft artillery units and has begun to use new tactics, burying damaged tanks underground, resembling excellent bunkers. The Red Army's goal in this line of operations is to advance towards the city of Kletskaya, but it encountered fierce resistance from the volunteer army, and in the end, it had to retreat to its original position. The German army and its allied forces are using cavalry in combat, and this Stalingrad battle is the beginning. Rumors that the German army has reached the Volga River have not been confirmed. According to reliable sources, the troops under General Bock occupied the city of Dubovka on the Volga River on the 26th of this month and continued south along the river, attacking Stalingrad directly. Another army also occupied the city of Kalach on the 26th and advanced north to Stalingrad. All factories in Stalingrad have now stopped work. Workers have nothing to do and are undergoing military training to be sent to the front lines to assist in the battle. On the Caucasus front, the important mountain passes from the Peng River to Transcaucasia are all in the hands of the German army. The German side is currently dispatching tanks to fight in the Caucasus Mountains. It is unprecedented for motorized units to participate in mountain warfare. The German General Headquarters seems to be intensifying pressure in the western sector in an attempt to isolate the Red Army currently fighting in the Black Sea coastal area. However, after the German mountain troops crossed the Krestovaya Pass, they are now advancing towards the Transcaucasian capital, Tbilisi. The Red Army has not offered resolute resistance and seems unwilling to stop the German advance, but the Red Army is adopting a "waiting for the enemy to tire" strategy, planning to launch a head-on attack after the German troops have traveled a long distance and are exhausted. The Red Army continues to attack in the central sector, especially southwest of Vyazma and in the Rzhev area. Its activity has expanded to the Volkhov River in the north, attempting to recapture the city of Shlisselburg. This important town is the railway center in the Volkhov River basin and was occupied by German forces on October 9 last year. The Red Army attempted to lift the siege of Leningrad but failed and suffered heavy losses. According to German military sources, the German General Headquarters has a large number of troops in the Volkhov and Leningrad area, sufficient to repel the Red Army. Once the environment permits, it can launch a decisive counteroffensive. As for the Rzhev area, the German side acknowledges that German forces have adopted a defensive posture near the city of Metino to the north of the city and near the city of Gzhatsk. However, the Red Army's offensive today is not as fierce as it was yesterday, presumably because the Red Army has suffered significant losses in manpower and material resources.

### Hungarian Army Commander Wounded in Action, Son-in-Law of Horthy Enlists, Joins the Air Force

Rome, 30th, Alliance News Agency: According to a public announcement from Budapest yesterday, from April, Hungarian troops operating in the Soviet Union have suffered a total of 14,522 casualties.

### Yellow River Water Level Rises Again, Strict Precautions Prevent Disaster

Luoyang, 30th: According to the person in charge of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the Yellow River water level once surged during the flood season and then stabilized. After the 27th, due to heavy rains upstream, the water level increased again. According to the Shaanzhou measurement station, the flow rate of the river was 10,500 cubic meters per second. Fortunately, the precautions along the banks were strict, and no disaster occurred. The water level is now declining.

Stalingrad: Easy to Defend, Difficult to Attack, The Situation is Temporarily Deadlocked

Stockholm, Sweden, 30th, Havas News Agency: Fierce fighting has been taking place in the Stalingrad area for six days. Today, the German offensive has slowed down, and the situation will be temporarily deadlocked and quiet before the German forces launch another offensive. The 26th and 27th of this month were the most dangerous periods for the Red Army. Fortunately, General Golikov's army launched a large-scale counteroffensive west of Stalingrad, and the situation turned from danger to safety. The pressure exerted by the German forces on both flanks has eased slightly. Although the German forces on both flanks have made great efforts in the past six days, they have still not reached a decisive stage, because both sides are desperately trying to fill the gaps with fresh troops. According to the latest reliable information, the analysis of the situation in Stalingrad is as follows: The Stalingrad front line is shaped like a crescent, with the main forces of both sides in the center and the strength of the left and right wings relatively weak. In other words, the northern part starts from the city of Pichuga on the Volga River (only 18 miles from Stalingrad, where the German vanguard arrived yesterday) and goes west, passing the Don River to the city of Kalach, and then southeast through Blutpoya, which is only 40 miles away. General Timoshenko's troops have built solid fortifications within these 40 miles and are determined to defend this "steel city" at any cost. Fierce fighting is expected to occur soon. Whether a decisive battle will occur as the German-Soviet war enters its 63rd week is difficult to say. The Red Army, holding Stalingrad, has concentrated all kinds of weapons, and its defense positions are as solid as a fortress. The German side calls it the "Little Maginot Line." According to a German war correspondent, every step forward, whether in manpower or material resources, must be paid a heavy price. In short, the battle of Stalingrad is an unprecedented and brutal battle.

Bern, Switzerland, 29th, Havas War: The Basler Nachrichten recently received a telegram from a correspondent stationed in Berlin stating that the German forces are fighting victoriously in the Caucasus. The reason for this is that the German forces have adopted brilliant tactics in mountain warfare. The mountain troops under General Kleist, when climbing mountains, are led by assault teams. These teams are composed of well-trained mountain troops and special forces, equipped with powerful weapons, anti-aircraft mortars, and field guns, and use encirclement tactics that have been repeatedly successful in the Norwegian campaign. Sometimes, they also use paratroopers to land behind enemy lines to launch attacks from both the front and the rear. The Red Army, caught off guard, often lacks the will to fight and retreats. Moreover, these mountain troops often move out at night to implement encirclement tactics. All soldiers are connected to each other with huge ropes for climbing. Heavy weapons are not used lightly until the preliminary preparation work is completed. After these assault teams gain a foothold in front, all their supplies are provided from the air by airplanes. This tactic is easy to succeed in mountain warfare and saves manpower.

Ladoga Lake: Italian Speedboats Active, Soviet Planes Launch Widespread Air Raids on Germany

Rome, 29th, Alliance News Agency: The Italian Supreme Command announced on the 29th that Italian speedboat squadrons are now active on the Ladoga Lake in the eastern front. One squadron attacked the Soviet 15th Fleet, which was heading towards Leningrad. The speedboat squadron under the command of Lieutenant Pezzi has sunk 1,300 tons of Soviet ships. In the past few months, this squadron has assisted ground troops in the Black Sea area, greatly facilitating the advance.

Rome, 30th, Huitong News Agency: Italian newspaper commentators said that the Italian military report mentioned yesterday that Italian speedboats were active on Lake Ladoga. As a result, the last route for the Soviet army to cross the lake to Leningrad has been cut off. Therefore, the Italian speedboats have now assisted the German and allied forces in completing the complete encirclement of Leningrad.

Berlin, 30th, Alliance News Agency: It was revealed today that Soviet bombers flew to eastern and northern Germany last night, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs over a vast area, causing slight damage on the ground. Some Soviet planes reached Berlin, but were intercepted by accurate anti-aircraft artillery and had to attack from high altitude, dropping bombs in the suburbs, causing minor damage.

Bern, Switzerland, 29th, Havas News Agency: According to a Swiss newspaper report from London, the British government believes that Germany will launch a large-scale bombing campaign against British cities this winter and is actively urging the public to make preparations. Women's auxiliary teams have been organized, and all passive air defense work will be handled by women. All firefighters have undergone special training in the past three months. According to the British Daily Mail, Germany's large-scale bombing of Britain will take place in October and November, as the weather on the eastern front will be cold and unsuitable for activity.

Lisbon, 29th, Alliance News Agency: A telegram from London states that large formations of German aircraft bombed military facilities and munitions factories in northern and northeastern England on the 28th, dropping many bombs.

Vichy, 30th, Huitong News Agency: The French port of Le Havre on the Atlantic coast has been repeatedly attacked by British aircraft and is now almost a dead city.

The city suffered no losses during the Western Front campaign, but is now being ravaged by France's former ally. Wealthy residents who returned to their homes after France signed an armistice with Germany have now fled the city again. Poor people gather in the countryside every night for a chance to sleep peacefully. Water and electricity have been destroyed by air raids, and many young people are threatened by tuberculosis.

### Northern Ireland Public Appeal for Pardon of Murderers

Dublin, 29th, Havas News Agency: Six young men from Northern Ireland have been sentenced to death for the murder of a police officer and are scheduled to be executed on September 2.

Members of the public in Northern Ireland also met recently to discuss rescue measures. Some people have argued that if the government does not grant a pardon, all of Ireland should observe a national day of mourning. The latest news chronicle in London advocates for leniency, saying that the case has a political background and that the criminals are all young people aged 19 to 22. Although the verdict is based on the law, the fact that six lives are being used to compensate for one is bound to cause controversy. The Daily Mail and the Times also advocate for pardoning the young criminals, saying that if these six young people are hanged, the relationship between Britain and Southern Ireland will become more difficult. Conversely, if they are pardoned, it would be a gesture of friendship.

All districts have recently received orders from the responsible authorities to conduct investigations and report on young men in their jurisdiction between the ages of twenty and forty-five. After the investigation is completed, they will be assigned accordingly. Except for special cases such as civil servants, those with significant physical defects or disabilities, no one will be allowed to avoid service on false pretenses, otherwise, they will be severely punished. Also, although it has been several months since the issuance of citizen certificates in the French Concession, many citizens have not yet received them. It is expected to take several weeks to obtain them. Residents who discover that the Baojia chiefs are creating difficulties in issuing citizen certificates can report them to the responsible authorities.

### Two Old Guns Confiscated

Xu Kaitai, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, previously arrested two people, Russian Lickovev and Chinese Ni Yusheng, at the Zhongnan Inn on 217 Avenue Edward VII, Miller Road, etc. A large handgun and a small-sized "yam" gun were confiscated, both damaged and unable to fire, and without bullets. They were taken to the police station and sent to the court for detention, pending a rescheduled investigation. It was determined that Lickovev was a gunsmith. The small handgun found at Ni Yusheng's place was given to him by a fugitive named Agen for sale, priced at 400 yuan. He was arrested shortly afterward. The trial was continued the previous morning. The police lawyer stated the process and requested an extension to thoroughly investigate the crime.

### Arrest for Shorting Food Rations

Qian Keliang, a chef at the Jiangsu Inn at 50 Fuzhou Road, ordered Wang Xinghui, an employee, to purchase 1.5 dou of white rice and 0.5 dou of broken corn with ten ration tickets on the morning of the 28th from the Hengfeng Rice Shop at 741 Niuzhuang Road. Yin Xiyuan, the son of the shop owner, Yin Qiying from Wuxi, measured and provided the rice. After Wang brought it back, Qian measured it again and found it short by one-third of the white rice, totaling 0.5 dou, and one-fifth of the corn, totaling 0.1 dou. He went to negotiate with the rice shop. The Hengfeng Shop immediately supplied 0.3 dou of white rice, but Wang Xinghui refused to accept it. He then reported it to the Old Gate Police Station. Chinese detective Wang Nianxiu rushed to the scene and arrested Yin Xiyuan. Considering that people are already feeling that the food rations are not enough, the shop still shorted the amount. If it is not severely punished, it will not be enough to deter others from doing the same. Therefore, he was detained pending investigation and prosecution.

### Authorities Control Prices, Set Price Limits; Focus on Stabilizing Food and Daily Necessities Prices; Penalties for Violations Set

The "Shanghai Times" reports that official announcement of severe price controls to stabilize the city's economic life and setting maximum price limits for all commodities is imminent. Merchants with goods in the city have been eager to sell them off since yesterday (the 29th), anticipating that prices will not only fail to rise but will also fall. Officials remain silent on this matter. However, according to well-informed sources, when the strict price control regulations are announced, officials will base them on the old legal tender prices from the evenings of May 26 to 28, converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of two to one, in order to regulate price levels. The authorities are currently studying prices from May 26 to 28 and compiling a complete list of price limits for promulgation. Items not included in the list will have their price limits set at the highest price for most goods on the market. Enforcement of the new price limit regulations will be jointly undertaken by the Japanese side and the standing bureaus of the three districts of this city, working under the guidance of a centralized price control committee. The committee will not only set price limits but will also determine penalties for violations. It is heard that the investigations and discussions conducted by the relevant authorities have been completed and that the price control regulations will be announced and implemented in the short term, so that profiteers will not have time to sell their goods on the market. Meanwhile, residents of this city have been waiting for the authorities to curb prices for a long time. Now that the authorities are about to implement price control regulations, they are very excited. It is generally believed that the implementation of price limits will first focus on adjusting and stabilizing food and daily necessities prices, as the time for strict control of these prices is now ripe.

### Problems with the Underwriting Amount of Fire Insurance

â An

The article "The Insurance Industry's Future is Worrying," published in this publication on July 13th, was written by a Mr. Ning Shao from an insurance company. It discussed the current environment and the difficulties of operating an insurance business, drawing attention from various parties. Mr. Pan Chuitong, manager of China Insurance Company, specifically wrote "Where Do the Profits of Fire Insurance Companies Lie?" for this publication, published on July 27th, based on his own business operations. With his profound knowledge and experience, he analyzed the income and expenditure situation of an insurance company with a monthly premium income of 400,000 yuan, concluding that it was "just enough to cover expenses." After this article was published, it garnered even more attention, with some even sending letters inquiring about the author's real name. Does this mean that operating an insurance business today is indeed impossible? Why, then, are new insurance companies still springing up like mushrooms after rain? There must be those with unique insights. For example, Mr. Wang Yutong, secretary of Taiping Insurance Company and former editor of Insurance ç Magazine, also wrote "Two Lifelines of Insurance Companies" under the pen name Huai Xuan for the August 18th issue of this publication. He pointed out the current business objectives of general insurance companies from the two aspects of business revenue and capital revenue. Mr. Wang started from the actual situation and used his sophisticated techniques to find a way out for new insurance companies. This differs from Mr. Pan's views. Mr. Pan has now written another article, focusing the issue on reinsurance, further elaborating on his view that it is difficult to operate. We are publishing it urgently, hoping it will be noticed by those who care about the industry's future. (Editor)

The fire insurance business originated in England. Initially, it could not fully develop because it could not accept large insurance amounts. In 1853, the German Cologne Insurance Company invented reinsurance, which greatly promoted the development of the industry. Therefore, the invention of reinsurance is a sacred achievement in the history of insurance.

A fire insurance company's limit table is very complex. The limit varies depending on the level of construction, the location, and the usage of the building. If explained in detail, even tens of thousands of words would not be enough. As for the standard of the retention amount, here is a very simple example:

For a company with a capital of 2.5 million yuan, the average retention amount for each risk is set at 60,000 yuan, which cannot be considered low. If the monthly premium income is 99,000 yuan, how much should be ceded? Two points must be clarified first: Assuming the average premium rate is 33 yuan per 10,000 yuan of insured value, then the insured amount for 99,000 yuan of premium is 30 million yuan. If this 30 million yuan of property is stacked in one warehouse, then a company with a capital of 2.5 million yuan underwrites this 30 million yuan of property in the warehouse, and the retention premium from the 99,000 yuan of premium income is 198 yuan (calculated based on the retention amount of 60,000 yuan). The remaining 98,802 yuan of premium must be entirely ceded to the reinsurance company to earn commission (the current actual commission is no more than 5%). If this 30 million yuan of property is evenly distributed among 500 separate Shikumen houses, with 60,000 yuan stacked in each house, then all the 99,000 yuan of premium income can be retained without ceding to the reinsurance company. However, the business received by fire insurance companies can never be so evenly distributed. Understanding this and extrapolating, one can study the issue of premium allocation and at the same time understand the difficulties of ceding and accepting reinsurance. Operating fire insurance without studying reinsurance is close to gambling. Scholars have repeatedly said that insurance is not gambling.

Reinsurance methods are generally divided into two types: Treaty Reinsurance, which is an agreement with the reinsurance company on a limit, without the need to notify each transaction in advance; Facultative Reinsurance, which is the temporary reinsurance of the insured amount with local peer companies. Treaty Reinsurance, relying on the background of British and American companies, can currently only obtain a very small amount of reinsurance treaty with the only åå insurance company. Large reinsurance treaties can never be obtained. If Chinese companies enter into reinsurance treaties with other Chinese companies, not only is the amount very small, but there is also the possibility of encountering the same danger. Facultative Reinsurance, called facultative in name, is actually extremely difficult and troublesome. Any fire insurance company employee who is in charge of reinsurance must know this very well.

As for the use of insurance company funds, it is different from other commercial institutions, and its restrictions are very strict, not as flexible as other commercial institutions.

Therefore, at present, domestic fire insurance companies that operate in accordance with fire insurance principles are not only feeling difficult for new companies, but also old companies that have accumulated tens of millions or millions of yuan in reserves are feeling difficult. Old companies still have business in other cities to supplement the insufficiency of this city. If they only rely on the business of this city, the difficulties are even greater.

### Market Dynamics

The call loan rate continues to ease, falling to 12%, indicating that floating capital is stagnant and the market has temporarily entered a standstill. After the "Measures for the Management of Stocks" were announced, people's hearts turned to stability because it was not as strict as generally expected. Therefore, the market atmosphere was revitalized. The commodity market continues to be pressured by the talk of control, and is increasingly fatigued.

Government Bonds Show Signs of Movement

At the beginning of the week, the price market had transactions of hundreds of thousands of yuan every day, but it became idle afterwards. The trend also rose slightly and then fell back. The lowest prices of each bond were higher than those of the previous week; except for Type A, the highest prices have not yet exceeded the previous week's record. Potential energy has been seen in its early stages. Yesterday, various newspapers published a certain telegram, which may provide considerable assistance to the price market in the future, but it is also uncertain.

Chinese Stocks Turn Around

This publication mentioned in the previous issue that the Chinese stock market atmosphere would show slight excitement. This excitement has been seen since the announcement of the Interim Measures for the Crackdown on Chinese Companies' Stocks last Wednesday. The so-called crackdown in the measures is nothing more than cracking down on stock companies with weak financial strength on the one hand, but it does not stipulate under what financial strength should be cracked down. On the other hand, it stipulates that stocks traded on the äººå¡² should be reviewed first, but it does not stipulate the standards for how to review. The depression of Chinese stocks for consecutive weeks was purely suppressed by the rumors of management. What we see today is not like that, and people's hearts are greatly encouraged. However, as this publication said, there is still no widespread revival. Therefore, although the stocks have generally rebounded, the rise is very limited. By the weekend, they were tired again. It shows that although the turning point has arrived, the development still has something to wait for.

In terms of the content of various å© changes: financial stocks have the largest increase, followed by new pharmaceutical stocks. Department stores, textiles, tobacco and leather stocks can only slightly reverse their decline due to the overall unfavorable situation.

Yarn and Cloth Weak

The yarn and cloth é¢¨ has been running for about a month. By last week, it had shown a turning point. Blue Phoenix has fallen by about 100 yuan compared to the previous week, and Bian Ma has also reached the 5,200 yuan mark. The market atmosphere of piece goods has also been frustrated because of this. It is true that the continuous rise in the past few weeks has shown weakness. In addition, the pressure from the talks of price management has been increasing day by day. On Friday, the Japanese side held a cotton conference to discuss the cotton allocation plan. Based on the estimate that this year's cotton production will increase by 30%, the allocation situation is also more optimistic. The yarn and cloth market atmosphere has also been relaxed and downstream.

### Extracurricular Talk

The Japanese-sponsored China Cotton Improvement Association's survey and statistics show that this year's cotton production in China can reach 2.2 million dan, an increase of 30% compared with last year.

The æ±å ± reported that the price freeze order will be implemented in this city starting from September 1.

Regarding the issue of price control in the Chinese occupied area, according to æ±å ±, a Continental Price Management Committee will be specially established in Tokyo, Japan, as the highest decision-making body.

### Heroes and Tough Guys

â Tang Mu

Before being executed, condemned criminals, in their drunken and satiated state, often utter a heroic saying, "In twenty years, I'll be a hero again!" People are often moved by this and regard them as tough guys.

In fact, both "hero" and "tough guy" are great terms and should not be applied to these robbers and murderers. It is undeniable that today's judicial system has not yet reached perfection. Therefore, we certainly cannot say that all the prisoners in jail deserve their punishment. However, it can be asserted that a large portion of them are guilty of robbery, fraud, theft, or forgery.

The reasons for their crimes mostly stem from illegal behavior. The reason they succumbed to the law is nothing more than living an excessively extravagant life, or having difficulty making a living and lacking the courage and perseverance to make an honest and fraud-free living, leading them to be unable to resist the temptation of money and material possessions. Therefore, those who test the law with their own bodies are not heroes or tough guys, but weaklings and scoundrels.

The American writer Burt put it well: "Even outside the walls of the prison, in our commercial institutions, political organizations, and even the Supreme Court, we feel that there are too few heroes and tough guys, and too many weaklings and scoundrels."

Those who can resist all temptations of money and material possessions and are willing to live a hard and honest life are heroes and tough guys, and are good citizens.

### Plants that Provide Drinks

â Jian Nong

This summer, Shanghai has been experiencing a drought for as long as forty days, and the temperature has risen to 103-4 degrees. Readers, do you also feel stifling, dry, and a bit like traveling in a fumigating, desolate, and boundless hot ã great desert? Okay, now I will tell you about several plants that provide drinks for people in these places where it is not easy to find water.

Traveler's Tree

The first thing that comes to my mind is the famous traveler's tree, also called the traveler's palm, which grows on the island of Madagascar in Africa. It is a type of banana family plant, about three zhang tall, with a dozen or twenty large leaves about five or six feet long sprouting from the top. Although the fruit it bears is also very beautiful, its value lies entirely in a stream of spring water hidden in its leaf axils? The location of this spring water is about six inches away from the petiole and trunk, where a kind of ç shaped object covers it. When travelers are thirsty and helpless, as long as they find this tree, they only need to insert a knife or gun four or five inches deep into the leaf axil, and when they pull out the knife or gun, a stream of clean water will gush out: when put into bottles, about a quarter of a å  æ can be obtained, cool and sweet. It is refreshing and truly a boon for travelers!

Desert Melon

In the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, there is also a strange plant that provides drinks for people and is regarded as life by the local natives. It is the "desert melon." In 1928, when an expedition team led by British Captain Clifford passed through a small Soviet village in the middle of this desert with only a few natives living in it, the captain asked the village chief what they drank during the dry season when it did not rain: the village chief took a shovel and led Clifford to look for it in the woods. Soon, he saw a dry vine that looked like a rope, and he dug away the sand on the ground with the shovel and pulled out a round corm. The corm was the size of a baby's head, and the skin was swollen as if wrapped in rubber. He cut it open with a knife, and sure enough, he found moisture, but the amount was very small...

Pitcher Plant

This pitcher plant, which is famous for its insectivorous nature, is now being doubted by scientists about its insectivorous ability day by day. The reason is: after carefully observing the pitcher plants cultivated in their flower rooms, scientists could not see that it had the true function of digesting insects, like the carnivorous plant è, although many insects drowned carelessly in the water in its bottle. So scientists believe that the special equipment of this tropical pitcher plant - the bottle - is probably just a mechanism for storing water. No matter what, it is a fact that it stores water in its bottle, and has supplied this water to people to drink. The evidence is! Once, when the great British naturalist Wallace was doing scientific research on a mountain in the Malay Peninsula, he searched left and right and could not find a water spring; he had to force himself to endure the stench and ä¸ ä»å¿, pick out the dead insects in the pitcher plant, and drink the water in the bottle in one gulp! What was the result, can you guess? The water was surprisingly sweet!

Cactus

There is also a plant that is located in a barren, rainless area, working hard to store some water for itself, but the result is still "silly big heads"! On the streets of Mexico City, people eat cactus like watermelon, needless to say; travelers or farmers traveling in Brazil cut open these cactus âå¯ âãããâto quench theirãå» when they are thirsty! I heard that many of them are very delicious.

### Idle Talk about Pawnbroking

â Xiao Chao Cui

(1) The "Maternal Uncle's Home" of the Poor

Inãpeaceful times, pawnbroking is an absolutely safe trading mechanism, and it is also the most convenient place for the turnover of the civilian economy. When poor people need soft goods without a place to turn, they just throw their clothes on the high counter and get them immediately. Afterwards, as long as the principal and interest are paid off before the expiration date, the clothes can immediately return to their own boxes. The poor regard the pawnbroker as the back door and are as close as "maternal uncle's home", ã greedy for the simplicity of the procedures, so pawnbroking naturally developed.

Shanghai originally had four types of pawnshops: pawn, mortgage, pledge, and deposit. The time limit is divided into 18, 12, 8, and 6 months. The interest rate is generally 1.6% to 2% per month for the first three types. The interest rate of deposit shops is divided into three levels: 2% per period (10 days) for less than 3 yuan, 3% per month for 3 yuan to 5 yuan, and 1.6% to 2% per month for more than 5 yuan. In recent years, the interest rate and time limit have been repeatedly increased or decreased ã proportionally, and its titles are no longer the previous four types. Generally, there are only two types: pawn and deposit. The former is due in eight months, with an interest rate of 5% per month and a storage fee of 5% for each entry and exit. The capital is about 100,000 to 1 million yuan. The latter has a limit of four å­ months (ã some have six months), the interest rate cancels the periodic basis and changes to 6% per month, and a storage fee of 6%. The capital is from 30,000 to more than 100,000 yuan. These are formal pawnshops, and the others are strange. Some places have a row of Yang è¡, companies, and pledges, doing business with gamblers. They not only pledge goods, but also pledge tickets (pawn tickets). The term is one to two months, and the interest and storage fee are written on the face of the ticket together, from 17% to 18% per yuan. Pawning tickets for money is a newly emerging trick set up for gambling, said to be for the purpose of opening the good door of "finding a way out of despair" for gamblers, giving gamblers some unusual convenience. In fact, it is a proud masterpiece of speculators who are purely for the purpose of obtaining high interest. The interest is extremely high and the time limit is extremely short, but there is a generation of gambling fish who are willing to be hooked for its convenience.

### Releasing Life

â Zhen Shi

One morning, I was walking in the Bund Park when I saw a middle-aged man in a summer cloth long shirt and wearing black glasses, with an honest ã face, carrying a vegetable basket of butterflies, walking towards the river. He grabbed a handful and threw it towards the center of the river with considerable force. After throwing about ten handfuls, he moved a few steps and threw another ten handfuls. Finally, he left an empty basket. Although he was full of sweat, heãsmiled so kindly and lovingly. I was also slightly moved by thisãsincerity in releasing life. Abstaining from killing and releasing life are originally two things that devout Buddhists earnestly practice. In the past, in the City God Temple, in the small lake under the Nine-Turn Bridge, the fish and turtles were crowded and full of ponds, all of which had been released. Who knew that when the night was quiet, 70% to 80% of them would be caught or caught, ready for you to buy and release them again on another day. In this way, up and down, what you are releasing is not fish and turtles, but several people who sell fish and turtles for release. The result became a lively drama with a rather farcical meaning.

I think if you have a kind heart, it is better to donate it to a good deed with more positive meaning, such as donating to a scholarship, because this is not only releasing life, releasing the life of things, but also releasing the life of mankind. (Move to reward scholarships)

### Sharing the Same Boat in Wind and Rain

â He Jia Zhi

What to Do with Eight ã Nai?

This is behind Wei Yunqing's house. The water bridge is next to the river, and the shore is sparsely sparselyç«¹æ. There is a brick and stone paved path leading from the water bridge to the shore. Second Mrs. Ye, supported by Magpie, walked on the path, looking ahead as she walked, to see the end of the path, a door. The door was open, and a person was walking out of the door. The person was an old nanny, carrying a bucket of water in one hand and a few pieces of wet clothes in the other. Second Mrs. Ye saw her, but she didn't see Second Mrs. Ye. She muttered to herself; "It's so cold, but I still have to change clothes every day. If I don't wash them, I'll be scolded. If the old man finds out, I'll be scolded too. Being a servant is to be scolded for a lifetime." She took a few steps, and I don't know if she kicked a brick under her feet, or for some other reason, the upper half of her body slumped forward, and the dirty water in the bucket that had been used to wash clothes poured out all at once, and she almost fell. Second Mrs. Ye was more than ten steps away from her, and Magpie rushed forward to help her up. Second Mrs. Ye also hurried to catch up and said with a smile, "Did you kick something under your feet? Fortunately, you didn't fall." The old nanny straightened up and stared at Second Mrs. Ye and the others in a daze.

Second Mrs. Ye said, "We came from the water bridge behind the house, to visit Mr. Wei. Are you helping the Wei family?" The old nanny nodded and said, "I am working under the eldest young master. I don't know who poured water on this road first, and the water has frozen into ice. It's slippery to step on, so it's no wonder people fall. It's that troublemaker who poured the water." Second Mrs. Ye said, "Well, you haven't fallen, it's just a false alarm. Let me ask you, have you added a few people to your family?" The old nanny said, "Who did you add?" Second Mrs. Ye said: There is a Fei Changhe, isn't he living in your house?" The old nanny simply turned the bottom of the bucket upwards to pour out the remaining water in the bucket, put the clothes she was carrying in one hand into the bucket, and replied, "Fei Changhe, I have heard this name, yes, yes, isn't he a man with a goatee? He is a Jiangbei native." Second Mrs. Ye said, "Then you are mistaken. I am not asking about this eight. I am asking you, do youã have female guests in your family? Is there someone who calls her Miss Bian? If you do, tell me." (168)
